Good USA company that stands behind their products . I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you . I had one burst after awhile , you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises . The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time . Highly reccomend . Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away , but it does have a far reach .	1
This is a high quality 8 ply hose . I have had good luck with Gilmour hoses in the past . A good choice in hoses .	1
It 's probably one of the best hoses I 've ever had.Pro 's : - It 's good enough for most front yards , or small back yards.- It has enough flow ( and with the right head ) to water plants 25ft away from the nozzle , and water your garden.- It 's light weight , and flexible ( it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I 've owned ) - The hose is flexible , yet strong . I have n't cut the outside yet.- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months , and the rubber has n't cracked yet ! I believe it 's good quality rubber.cons : - Like with every hose , keeping it outside in the sunshine , the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog do n't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color ( I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool ! I bought 2 of them , one 25ft for my front garden , and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition !	1
I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars , but that 's my fault not a product fault .	1
I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses -- 50 , 75 , and 100 feet -- for different areas of yard around the house . After a season of use they 've proven to be good hoses . Of course , it 's very favorable that they do n't leak . But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility , which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses . The flexibility diminishes in cold weather , but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They 're not especially prone to kinking , but they 're not kink-proof , either , nor do they claim to be . They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others , but the latter were fairly stiff , so there was a trade-off.Bottom line : this was a good purchase .	1
I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product , Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days , Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway , But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse , I would recommend this to anyone , Thanks	1
After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses . The water flows with much more force , which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle . Most garden hoses are only 1/2 '' diameter , and some premium hoses are 5/8 '' , but this is 3/4 '' .There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls , plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction . You 'd be amazed looking at the charts , just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses . For example : I 'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart . At 5 gallons per minute , the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4 '' pipe ( same size as this hose ) . For a 1/2 '' ( regular hose size ) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that 's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter ! I also noticed , this hose also has less tendency to kink .	1
This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i do n't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern .	1
I 'll buy more of these come Spring . Holding up very well to the extreme heat and cold of Idaho . A bit on the heavy side , but that is what makes them last so well .	1
So far so good ! I have not really had the time to test out the hose as it is cold weather time right now . I bought this Gilmour hose based on all the recommendations . I am looking forward to not having to wrestle the hose to use it .	1
Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses . You stand behind your product and provide great customer support.. But I am only giving you 4 stars because this hose and the 100 footer I bought a few months back seem to kink more than my older Flexogens not sure why ?	1
This is a good quality hose that I use to connect to my & # 34 ; Scarecrow & # 34 ; so as to keep the deer away from my plants . It sits in the sun all day long and so far shows no sign of degradation .	1
I bought a cheap hose that did n't hold the pressure after 2 days . This bad boy hold the pressure and does n't leak . Its not even expanding . Great quality hose . I will be keeping them in mind when I need more length .	1
I was worried about getting a short one , but this serves my need just fine , as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one . I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier . slightly stiff to lay out , but if it were n't , I am sure it would kink . I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me	1
For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product . They just ca n't be beat for the price and/or guarantee . This hose is typical of a Gilmour item . It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products , comes with a lifetime guarantee . I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them . Quite a company !	1
It 's been outside in the hot ( South Florida ) sunshine 24/7 , and still flexible . No crackles , and remains in great shape ! A real bargain !	1
I 've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one . I do n't do much in the way of gardening , nor wash my car that often . So investing in a really good quality hose did n't make that sense to me . The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel , whether you use them or not . So in the long run you do n't save much . That , and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy . When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately . It 's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses . ( I 'm not sold on the long term quality of those ) . This thing is a pleasure to use , as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you 're done . It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while . It would feel much softer and more flexible . Something this does with or without sun . Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself , its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it . It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway , and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily . A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality , convenience , all for a fair price that I highly recommend ... : )	1
I 've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years . One of the odder phenomenons I 've experienced is that client 's will spend $ 1,000 on a garden sculpture or $ 100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden ! Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry , a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted ! Curly hoses , shrinky hoses , pink & purple hoses ... the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose . Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I . ( pounds per square inch ) , a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings , and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers ! Yes , there is heft to it 's weight ... that 's what you NEED from a quality hose ! And , it refuses to kink , even when you try to kink it as a test . I 've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company 's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one ! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use , rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7 . Also , for very small Urban Gardens , rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25 ' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1 ) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need . Mark that length down . Then , using the same rope , measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis . If the difference is more than 10 feet , BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES ! Yes , I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis , you only need a 50 ' hose to reach your 40 ' garden , WHY are you buying a 100 ' hose to drag around ? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool , buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you 'll only use rarely . Hoses come in 10 ' , 25 ' , 50 ' , 75 ' , 100 ' and 150 ' length ; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90 % of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2 ) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel , turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose ! If you hate getting dirty hands , use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose , just continue to coil it , turning the hose as needed.3 ) During the Summer , attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose : the one connected to your home 's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice . WHY ? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water , there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle , making it completely impossible to remove ! I know that we 're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me ... when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $ 70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling , that $ 2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless ! 4 ) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE , DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE , VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA ! ! ! If I do n't do it for my client 's and trust them to do it , it never gets done . And after the first hard frost , trapped water in nozzles , hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night . It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments ; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed ! 5 ) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE , is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling , which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that ca n't be fixed ! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a `` brake '' and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs . When I gain new clients , I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them , never having to do it again . Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose . You wo n't be sorry ! : )	1
This little hose was purchased to add on to my other 50 foot hose due to the very humid and oppressive weather this last month in the Northeast . It is very flexible and easy to handle and allows me total reach of the back perennial garden . i would recommend this hose	1
There is only one thing wrong with this design : the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently . Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape . That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications . It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.That said , the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair .	1
This is definitely a good quality nozzle . It is similar to the & # 34 ; old fashioned & # 34 ; type nozzle we had as kids . It gives differing spray patterns depending on how far you squeeze the trigger .	1
It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but do n't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle . This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past . The trigger has a real nice , snappy , feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic , I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA . The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger . Everything else about it is perfect .	1
I am very happy that I bought this nozzle . It is exactly what I wanted . Good quality and I highly recommend it . I really need it too .	1
I have bought many types of nozzle over the years and this old timer which I used to use when I was growing up served me well this past season .	1
This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design , sturdily made and inexpensive . It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip . It also does n't leak at all where it attaches to the hose ! My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern , it can come out unevenly & # 8211 ; e.g. , it 's not an even & # 34 ; circle & # 34 ; of water coming out , which makes watering evenly a little challenging . But it 's not a big deal.Get one , you 'll like it .	1
Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years -- manufactured in a dozen companies -- and sold under a wide variety of brand names -- -for a very good reason -- -they are the best design . They are perfectly and easily controllable , durable , and do n't leak . You can get `` prettier '' versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles , if `` pretty '' is your priority -- -but , functionally speaking , you ca n't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed . If you wish , you can tighten the screw ( you may need pliers to do so , and/or you may need to grease the screw threads ) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws -- -that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top -- -when the lever is complete depressed , you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing , and then you can release your grip . So , this is a `` lock on '' device , which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want . For example , if you always want a medium cone spray , you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no `` medium '' strength , e.g. , for filling buckets . What do you expect ? The actual `` problem '' , as far as that reviewer was concerned , is the nozzle is `` too good '' -- -it delivers full pressure , at all but the tightest mist setting . Although it does have a `` closed '' position , this is a nozzle , NOT a valve . If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE , then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle . Or , close your faucet part way . Alternatively , to fill a bucket , loosen the thumb screw , then `` open 'er up '' ( squeeze the handle all the way ) -- -the result is is maximum unfocused flow , which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket , etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers ( of this and other products ) write reviews about different , but similar-looking , products . Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT `` Gilmour 572TF '' . If you find a sprayer that looks like this in `` bargain bin '' at your local hardware store -- -it probably is not a `` Gilmour 572TF '' , unless the packaging says so . Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor ( rather than Amazon itself ) -- -you do n't get exactly the product described . I 'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best , but only that THIS review is about the `` Gilmour 572TF '' , and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics ( South Florida ) -- -the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools . After a year or two , the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew . I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you do n't have silicon grease on hand , buy a tube -- -it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items , and even for lubricating things such as this . While you are at it , lubricate all your hose connections ( both the threads and the seals ) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease ? Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals . However even petroleum grease is better than no grease ( besides most hose gaskets are now plastic , not rubber ) After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff , presumably caused by internal corrosion ( or the original grease having deteriorated or lost ) . The handle ( the lever in back ) is steel , and can rust . Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking ( after 5 years or so of abuse ) . Ideally , keep the nozzle dry -- -at least do n't keep it in a muddy puddle , or half-buried in acidic soil . It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff . ( With the water off , squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod . Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston ) . If the nozzle is very stiff , take it off the hose , spray it heavily with WD-40 , let it soak for 15 minutes or so -- -that will probably adequately loosen it up , but is not a permanent solution -- -you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes -- -reasonably well taken care of ( or at least not abused ) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES > Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles , such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle . These are virtually indestructible , and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it. > Those `` prettier '' versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter , and might get the wife 's approval . Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF , and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front , Red , Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black , Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle. > High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S > There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $ 1 -- $ 2 in `` bargain bins '' , which are a good deal for the price , but are not nearly as durable , and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer. > There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front -- -but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design , reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve . You 'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above . I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying . For example ( not recommended ) Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red > If you ( or your wife ) insists on a `` pretty '' nozzle with s electable spray patterns , I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584 . One setting is the full-action , and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action . I.e. , the zinc will `` sacrifice '' itself ( and corrode ) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching , or with which it is sharing a conducting solution ( such as a water-saturated acidic soil ) , or salt-water . So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted , ungalvanized steel , or salt water . ( Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose , to prevent the iron from rusting -- not as a barrier like paint , but rather by electrolytic action ) .What about those other pretty , fancy , mostly plastic sprayer nozzles ( which cost 3x -- 4x more ) that you see at the garden center ? -- -they do n't work nearly as well , and wo n't last nearly as long . I know this for a fact -- -my wife keeps buying them -- -indeed we have a bin of discarded ( mostly still functional ) `` pretty '' sprayer nozzles , which have `` fallen out of favor '' for various reasons .	1
I 've tried all sorts of nozzles for my hose and they either break , get stuck on the end of the hose , or do n't have enough power to really blast things with water . This nozzle is durable , easy to remove , and super strong !	1
I 've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me , too . It killed me to spend so much on a sprinkler , but I 've probably sunk so much on junk sprinklers in the past 10 years and bit the bullet after reading the reviews for the Raintrain . Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive , but it does a good job and that is a real draw.Operation is easy . Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track ' that the Raintrain runs on . By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used . Then sit back and enjoy as the Raintree does the work . No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered . It does n't get much simpler.The spray is low and slow so everything gets watered more effectively and there is less evaporation . My lawn really looks better than it had when I used my old sprinkler.I use this in my garden and it does a good job keeping all my perennials and herbs staying healthy and lush.This sprinkler is well made and worth the higher than average price .	1
There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler , and a good one to have if one has a large lawn . It 's definitely sturdily built , and with a steel body , it appears nearly indestructible . Because it 's a & # 34 ; traveling & # 34 ; sprinkler , once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover , it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling . One does n't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground . Also , there 's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own . This is particularly useful if you 're not going to be around to monitor it.Now , a couple less positive features . First , this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles . We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards . Also , we have tree rings and the like , which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest . We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts . So , buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second , it is a very heavy sprinkler . I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object . But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment , this is n't it .	1
This looks like it will be a great piece of equipment . I 've used it a couple of times so far and have been impressed . The only problem is if it hits a soft area of the yard , the wheels can sink in and it gets stuck . You certainly ca n't just set it and forget it . It needs to be babysat every half hour or so to ensure it is still moving .	1
After hearing so much about this unit , and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood , I decided to give it a try , even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.I now know why so many people like it . It is very effective in watering the lawn , without spraying water high up in the air ( less chance for evaporation , and not affected by wind as much ) , and it has hands-off operation once you set it up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy , and using the hose as a way to set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea . The adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated , and not needing to go out and move hoses is a welcomed change . This sprinkler is worth the purchase price !	1
Update/Tip : The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms . I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet . What 's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms . For instance , I will use one of the original with one of my new ones . The new one will get the center which the originals do n't do that well . I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough . See my photos for a better idea. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Unfortunately it 's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW . In fact , we do n't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain . But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water . Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work . I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down . But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards ... I thought high speed was perfect for my needs . Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch ! Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great . I did n't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last ? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time . Hopefully a decent investment .	1
I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6 ' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12 '' away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth , new pipes just are n't in the cards . Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root . I 've been very lucky so far , I 've been able to repair all but one of them . Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm , through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes , and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree , 0 % humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train , because its time to make it rain ! : ) You lay out a hose path for this , no sharp turns , and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit . Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop , and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it . Turn on the water and set to high or low ( high goes faster , disperses less water per square inch ) and go do something else for a while . You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage , then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it would n't make it uphill , but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain . On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement . How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit , then through the two wands which spin , turning a gear that turns the wheels . Simple and ingenious.I 've only had it jump off the hose once , and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it . Do note that if it jumps the hose it 'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose . So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day , you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off . This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe , its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train . This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system , but it 'd be fine for watering a really large area that has n't been fitted with an irrigation system yet , or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement .	1
I always like this hose , it 's reliable , less prone to kink and stand up a lot better than any other garden hoses I ever bought !	1
The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I 've ever had , and they are made in the USA . Thanks Gilmour ! Mine stay outdoors year round ( we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year , but very long , hot summers ) . They are very durable and do n't kink . I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty , but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later . I 've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose .	1
Short review : This hose is amazing , Made in the USA , tough as nails yet flexible , will not kink EVER , and I love it . Buy it now.Longer review : I bought a home depot memorial day special hose for $ 19.95 ( same size as this one ) and thought `` how different can hoses be ? this one says kink free . '' Three months of hose torture ensued , with me trying various tactics ( e.g . only moving hose when it 's pressurized ) to try to keep it from kinking . That damn endless kink hose is now in a pile in a garage ready for donation . It has more kinks in it than a Russian porn movie . Every time I used it I became more and more frustrated and thought longingly of this twice the price hose.Take my advice , buy this hose , it is worth it . It 's also nice to see it 's Made in the USA - at least something is . Amazing warranty . Even in cooler weather it stays flexible . Great brass fittings . They are right , this is the last hose I 'll ever buy . Please , Gilmour , do n't try to save on cost in the future - keep this hose just the way it is ! Hope this helps . Did I mention I love this hose ?	1
I thought I had already reviewed this hose . We love it ! It is strong and it attaches easily and smoothly to each other ( we bought TWO 100 ' lengths ) without leaking . I expect these hoses to last us a terrifically long time .	1
This hose is 100 feet and it makes it halfway around my house . A high quality hose for the price .	1
Even my landscaper said the Gilmour Flexogen 10058100 8-Ply Hose 5/8-inch by 100-foot is the BEST ! YOU JUST CA N'T KINK IT !	1
BEEN USING NOW FOR 3 YEARS . SLOWLY REPLACING ALL HOSES WITH THESE . KEEP THEM WRAPPED IN A WIND UP STORAGE CONTAINER AND IT LOOKS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE MANY YEARS OF QUALITY HOSES .	1
I really like this sprinkler . It works great , the pattern of water covers the distance that they said it would . Others I have purchased did not do so well and some did not last very long . I think Rain bird is a good company that I can rely on for good quality . Kind of rare now days .	1
For years I have purchased impulse sprinklers that work for a while , then plastic parts broke.Now that I have the Rain Bird I am certain that this well made sprinkler will outlast all the others.It is easy to adjust and gives good coverage .	1
I 've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well . The range is not quite 41 feet , but that 's probably due to my water pressure . i 'd say its closer to 30 at most . another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further , but it 's not the biggest deal . The positives about this are that it 's very solid- i 've never had a problem with it not operating properly , and it seems to spray the area very effectively . Considering that they 're going on 3 years now , i 'd buy them all over again with no hesitation .	1
We have unfiltered irrigation water - and the sprinkler heads get clogged with weeds , etc . This one seems to be more tolerant of that - and it really has a reach for distance . Good weight also helps keep the sprinkler in place	1
These sprinkler heads are well made , very functional and easy to use ; changing the settings is quite simple ; highly recommended	1
IMO , the gold standard in impact sprinklers . Buy one ( OK maybe four ) and be done with it.Rain Bird has built this right for decades and it 's a wonder why so many other companies cheapen this simple design .	1
I used to use a really primitive manual edger that I inherited from my father . Blistered hands and time wasted , I decided there had to be a better way and this is surely it.Edging is one of those necessary evils if you want a great looking house . I do n't edge every time I mow . Usually I do it every other time . The first time out after a long winter , edging usually takes a little longer . After that , edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower .	1
At the risk of sounding like an idiot ... I am 45-years-old . I have been a homeowner for nearly 20 years . And I have NEVER had a power edger . I have edged my lawn for almost 20 years with an old-fashioned , manual edger . Finally , after too many blisters , a sore back , and just plain old laziness , I decided to treat myself to the Edge Hog . And boy ... Am I glad I did ! Right out of the box , I could tell this was a quality product . Assembly could n't have been any easier . Just attach the top handle to the bottom handle . No tools required ! And everything else is pre-assembled . I had used a power edger in the past . Like maybe 30 years ago when I borrowed one from a friend so I could get the lawn done quicker and go play ball or something . But for all practical purposes , this was my first time . And it was easy as pie . I had no problem getting the hang of using the Edge Hog . The edging was done fast and easy . What a difference , too ! No more raggedy edge like I got from my manual edger . Instead I now get a nice clean `` professional '' edge . Finally ! And my back is so much happier ! ! The price on this product is competitive with other retailers . I had a $ 25.00 gift certificate and am an Amazon Prime member . So for about $ 65.00 total , I am now the proud owner of this quality Black & Decker edger . I highly recommend this product . If I could give it 6 stars , I would !	1
I had a previous Edge-Hog for a little more than 8 years when the motor brushes finally wore out . I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $ 30 , but then I decided to just get a new one . There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model . The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power , though that may be because of the new brushes working better . The one BIG change is the guard over the blade . It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part . It certainly is less safe.The older model had a & # 34 ; swing open & # 34 ; cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level . Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area . Bad part was having to stop for built up grass , or when the ground was wet , built up mud . You 'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open . There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection . The first day I used it , the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield , but not enough to really bog down the blade . I unplugged the unit for safety sake , but unlike the older model , you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud . If you use it on dry ground , the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.I am hoping to get at least eight years out of this unit , like I did with my last one .	1
The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn . I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer . The string trimmer did a choppy job , but the B & D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn . Before this purchase I dreaded the job . The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus . I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself . Anything that makes that job easier ( like this edger ) deserves five stars . I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job .	1
It would n't be too difficult to design a wider cutting blade that would create a wider 'trench ' ( although the motor might need some beefing up to handle the additional load ) and it would be great if it was easier to get more depth too ( it 's possible but requires a little backyard re-engineering ) . It 's worth what it costs , though ... I 'm basically satisfied .	1
dang this thing does some work , i just grab the handle and off i go , my lawn edges never looked so good .	1
This is the latest version of an edger B & amp ; D has been making for at least 20 years , and there are plenty of the 20 year old models still in use . It 's nearly silent , much easier to use than a gas model , and seems to cut better with less stalling than my neighbor 's 3.5HP gas model .	1
This edger does the job and more . I give it my highest recommendation.I had n't edged my lawn since last Fall when my gas-powered edger bit the dust . We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida . It propagates by spreading tough , vine-like runners . I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house . This edger cut right through them , which I did n't expect , given the toughness of the grass . But it never hesitated , except on some very stuborn growth . I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went , without even breathing hard . Even the gas-powered edger was n't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful . I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I did n't want it to go . Its light weight , easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it 's tethered to . I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass ( total edging is about 200-225 linear feet ) . Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front , so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line . With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets . No more gas and oil mix , no more new spark plugs , no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start , and it 's relatively quiet when running . Just press the trigger and go . Love it , love it , love it .	1
I love this edger ! I have been using it for almost 2 years , and it is still going strong . It has plenty of power , yet is easy to maneuver.I get a beautiful , straight edge along my sidewalk from using this tool . It is so easy to guide in a straight line . I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas , which has worked much better than a trimmer.We had a gas powered edger before this one , but it was too heavy for me . I actually enjoy yard work , but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage . Now that I have this electric edger , which is significantly lighter without the gas tank , as well as a manual mower , I do most of the yard work , and love it !	1
I 've purchased a lot of B & D product and edger is one of the best ! The trench feature is a great addition and it works great . I can edge my small yard in minutes and I do n't have to worry about mixing fuel or having to winterize my equipment .	1
If you need an edger , and do n't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger , this is the electric edger for you . It 's more powerful than most , and sturdy as all heck . But it 's also pretty light , too . Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower . If you 're edging your lawn with a string trimmer , or not edging your lawn at all , you 'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger .	1
So what did you want to know ? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool ( AFS ) . It is just plug and go . I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker . This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute . The spools last longer than expected . But all good things come to an end and you do n't want to be half way through the yard when you find your self strung out .	1
This & # 34 ; Black & Decker AF-100 String Trimmer Replacement Spool & # 34 ; is exactly what I needed for my Black & Decker cordless weed trimmer . This is east to install and it works as well as the original spool that came preinstalled on my trimmer.Works as expected ! Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
If you have a Black and Decker string trimmer that uses auto-feed string , this is the spool to buy . The string works well . The spool snaps in easily and you do n't have to mess with rolling a spool with bulk string .	1
This is the direct replacement part for the B & D ; Grass Hog model NST2018 . I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I do n't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one . This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change . The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I did n't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself . This is a good buy and works well . I recommend it to you !	1
This is a direct replacement and works great . My only gripe is that this particular weed eater uses way to much line .	1
I bought this for my black and decker trimmer and where else would i buy these ? its not worth driving to the store and look in different eisle to find something simple as these . Also amazon always seem to have the better price .	1
GOOD	1
At the time I purchased these replacement spools the official Amazon description listed only GrassHog NST2018 as compatible model . I can confirm that it works with the new GrassHog NST2118Black & Decker NST2118 12-Inch 18-Volt Ni-Cd Cordless Electric GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger.The automatic feed spool on GrassHog advances the string without needing to bump on the ground . The benefit of this system is that cutting is easier as it constantly replaces worn out string , the down side that the usage of the string is faster than when done manually.I have tried wounding the string by hand and found it a bit cumbersome and a bit time consuming , so I figured less than $ 5 per spool is not to bad to save me 5 minutes of time wounding and dealing with jammed string . Each spool contains 30 feet of 0.065 inch diameter round line . It is factory spooled and is wound tighter than when I wound the spool by hand.To replace the spool:1 . Remove battery2 . Squeeze the tabs on the spool cap to release it3 . Pull the empty spool out by pulling directly away from the housing4 . Clean out the housing from debris5 . Make sure that the level that controls the spooling is aligned with the edge of the housing6 . Take a string from the new spool and feed it through the eyelet in the housing7 . Push the spool into the housing and rotate it until it feels seated and the tabs of the spool align with the holes in the housing8 . Put the cap back on9 . The string outside the housing should be 5 3/8 inches , if it is longer than this length use scissors to trim itCollage of two different views of the spools in this package attached under customer photos.Overall , I am pleased with the spools - they should take me through the next couple of summers ! Ali Julia review	1
-Quick and fairly easy to install- Seems to be of good quality- Only option I know of for replacements for the B and D trimmer- Too expensive as someone already noted . The retail price is even more out there so I 'm glad Amazon cuts the price in half , but still expensive per roll .	1

Works as expected , no surprises of any kind . I 'm now on my 4th three pack and will get a 5th when the time comes .	1
Bought for the following trimmer ... This little trimmer really eats up the weeds and tall grass . Much better than any other cordless trimmer that I 've tried . Battery life is above average and charging is fast . I do have the B & D ; Blower that uses the same battery so I have a back up should I need it . I 'll edit this review and add to it after I 've had the opportunity to use it longer but so far , I am very pleased with the product .	1
so good , Bought these as extra to have them on hand and the one my weed eater came with is still working . Will order more as needed , I am all for no muss , no fuss ... ...	1
I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer . It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff . On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim , so no cutting of the line is necessary . Yes , it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself , but for roughly $ 4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort .	1
I looked around at several websites , and multiple options on Amazon and this was the best deal I found.Fit into my Black and Decker Trimmer perfectly . Just snap in and go .	1
For years , I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool . What a fiasco ! Once the factory-wound spool ran out , the line never again fed properly . No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding , the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up . I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass . Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these . They 're a godsend . Perhaps it 's more economical to wind your own spool , but if your time ( and blood pressure ) mean anything to you , disposable spools are the way to go . ( And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you wo n't be stuck if you do n't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand . )	1
Simply - these reels are inexpensive and easy to replace and install . They seem to last pretty long also . Highly recomend	1
It took many years for my Black and Decker Gross Hog trimmer to use up all of its string . Changing the empty string spool was a snap , and the new one works perfectly , just as I would expect . No complaints .	1
My string trimmer is a great light duty tool and works very good . I bought the extra spools of string for two good reasons it is much cheaper through Amazon than our local retailers and with fuel for the auto 's being at $ 3.35/ gal . this saves 3 trips to get the string and luck being what it is chances are when you give out of string the retailer will be out also . Good Buy from a good outfit to do business with ( Amazon.com ) .Thanks again , Denny	1
These are the refill for my weed whacker . They work fine and are easy to install . It is always good to have a few extra to replace the spent roll .	1
I 've started winding my own spools now . These are very convenient , but you really pay a hefty price for that convenience . I 'm buying bulk string now and use my drill motor to wind it onto the empty spools .	1
... I wish B & D would make a refill that held more than 30 feet . Otherwise , it 's a good product . I would give 4.5 stars if I could .	1
super easy to swap out and last a long time , unless you are chopping concrete ! I use these all the time , as I feel they are worth the extra cost for the convenience .	1
got these for my b & d 20 volt trimmer- fit perfect , and no problems . a little expensive , now rewind myself , but will purchase more in the future for my lazy days !	1
I use this on my 18v trimmer . It seems to last forever . Changing spools is a little tricky , but once you do it the first time , it really is n't an issue . Three spools will probably outlast the life of the trimmer - which I think is pretty well made .	1
I know it 's a lot cheaper to re-string your own spools but these are really convenient , and without the hassle of doing it on your own .	1
This is the easiest replacement string to install on a weed wacker . No mess , just place it in lock it and then go tackle your yard !	1
Easy to replace . Summer worth of string in these three spools . Carefully handle so that the string does n't be OEM uncoiled prior to install .	1
What can you say about replacement string . But , in 3 packs , more economical . It is fairly easy to replace . Good product	1
I put these in a cordless 18 volt Black and Decker trimmer and they have worked flawlessly . Just have to put them in the same way the old one came out with no tools just snapping them in place and letting about 4 & # 34 ; of string out and they feed the same way .	1
Works great and is easy to replace spool of line string for my Black & Decker 20-volt battery/cordless weed trimmer ! Good value when purchased in package .	1
I made the mistake of taking the spool that came with my B & D LST136 cordless trimmer and experienced what it would be like if I tried to save money by buying cord in bulk and winding my own spools . I painstakingly wound the cord from left to right and from right to left as instructed in the manual . I dropped it a few times and had to begin again . I did it right because the cord does advance automatically in my trimmer , but I have to say I am glad I purchased spools that are already wound . When I have to replace the spool that came with the trimmer , I will be careful to hold the cord tightly against the spool !	1
BZZZZZTTTT ... . ZAP ZAP . Dead bugs all over the place . I didnt use any of the mosquito attractant packs or anything but this thing does get rid of all the bugs around that are flying around if you have any lights on outside . Its fun to catch beatles and throw them into the zapper : D	1
I bought this hoping to kill mosquitoes . I plugged it in and watched the beautiful zapping . After a few nights of this , I did some research and found that 99 percent of those zaps were useful bugs . I decided to return it after killing hundreds of useful bugs in my yard and maybe ... maybe a mosquito or two .	1
It was a little smaller than I expected , but that was actually a plus in my book . It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs . If you were using this on your deck or something , may that would be a different story , but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway . I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well .	1
This one has one bulb ( versus 2 in the larger units ) .. I 've found that these last a couple of years with regular ( daily ) use.. My last one lasted about two years - and when it went out , the problem was n't the bulb - it was the transformer in the top of the unit . It runs silent ( no audible humming from more than a few feet away ) .	1
There 's not too much I can say about something as simple as a bug zapper other than -- it works well , it 's silent ( except when zapping bugs ) , it DOES attract and eradicate mosquitoes and other flying insects , and it 's only 15 watts.Happy with my purchase .	1
Only draw back I could come up with is my girlfriend is convinced the light is attracting more bugs from the neighborhood . lol . We have a pool and a pond , along with wetlands on our property , so we simply have a lot of bugs . This thing is working constantly while it is on . The zapping can get quite loud , but it is doing its job . We have it set up about 20 feet from out deck , and 15 from the pool . You do n't want it closer , as it will bring bugs around . They are attracted to it ... which is exactly what you want ! Just not right next to you . Cord it short , so you will need a heavy duty extension cord . I hung mine on a trellis , but if you do n't have something to hang it from , you may need a sturdy stand ... this things is pretty massive , and has some weight to it .	1
Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER ! ! ! I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week . I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects . I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck . I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time . It has been incredibly reliable and effective . These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend .	1
The unit is certainly getting a workout after the wet summer . I have not had any issues with the unit becoming clogged . I used a timer to save the unit from operating during the day to limit electricity use and save the bulb life . An unintended consequence of this unit was that I was able to light up a fairly dark area in our yard that gives an added sense of security . I would recommend .	1
... .to really tell if it works as we are short of mosquitos this year and I have not attached the bait that comes with it to attract what there are . I have had several of these in the past and they proved effective and this should be the same . Bulb cost is minimal thought limits advertised effectiveness to a half acre . I 'm not sure how they figured that out but our deck is 20 feet from a small pond that hatches these guys and this little machine should be OK to zap 'em .	1
Great price and it attracts bugs . It is on the side of our house and it seems to be helping .	1
Ca n't say enough good about this unit . I did a LOT of research before buying one and have to say i 'm very happy with this choice . It make a big difference on our back porch so long as you follow the directions . You want it mounted AWAY from where you 're relaxing so it attracts the insects away from you . This thing zapps them non-stop . Sometimes we just sit on the back porch and laugh at zap after zap . : )	1
Thus far after a week has done a good job but have to use a blower every day to blow out the debris , Bulbs are good and I run it24/7 thus a good buy , Having lots of mosquitos I bought to ofthe 1/2 acre ones thus put them in different places around the home here , Big plot of land here in rural area of gulf coast , Does not get them all but sure helps a lot	1
I purchased one of these for my backyard that is about 1/2 acre and has lot 's of foliage and a koi pond . I built a stand for it and placed it about 20 ' from our patio , on the oppsite side of the koi pond and it seems to work very well . It utilze 's an arc of electricity to kill the insects that are unlucky enough to go to the light . There are verticle bars surrounding the lamp that when a insect touches two of the bars , the flowtron utilizes the insect to complete the circuit until there is n't sufficient insect left ( burnt up ) to continue the arc . Generally this is a fairly quick process ( ZAP ) however the occasional moth or larger bug will fly in and you 'll hear a nice zaaaaaaaap or sizzzzzzzle until enough is `` gone '' to break the arc.Maybe it 's morbid - I enjoy hearing the zap and the occasional sizzzzzzzzle because that is one less nusuance bug to bite my family , my guests or my dog . I can whole heartedly recommend this product !	1
For instance , if you want the bugs off of your patio , do not install it on the patio . Install it about 25 feet away , and you will be amazed at how well it works .	1
We have had a very wet summer here in Georgia and the bugs have been horrible . This was a great price for what you get and does the job .	1
I just threw away one of these that I 've had for over twenty years . I later found out that what I thought was an electrical issue , was really only a bulb gone bad . Well , anyway , I bought a new one and it looks a lot better than the old one , and seems to work just as well . Not sure just how many mosquitoes it 's killing , but there 's a pile of insects on the deck below it every morning .	1
received this yesterday and installed it . it replaced an old one by flowtron I have had for 10 years . this one is for 1 acre and the light appears to be very intense . it was zapping last nite .	1
i have not taken this out of the box yet but it looks great . note : it is recommended that this be located a certain distance from the house it protects ... and it requires power .	1
I do love this bug zapper , but I noticed there were n't as many dead bugs around it as I thought there would be , seeing as we have a heavily wooded property complete with creek ( lots of bugs ! ) . One late night , almost midnight , I went out into the side yard with my dog so she could do her business , and saw BATS flying from the woods and zooming by the bug zapper , then back to the trees again . The bats were picking off the bugs that were attracted by the bug zapper ! How cool is that ? ! ? I am such a city kid that I made myself a cup of hot cocoa and sat by the back door with the porch light on , just watching the bats go back and forth . Since that evening , I 've seen the bats almost every time I happen to go outside late at night , so I guess my bug zapper is doing well to keep our local bats fat and happy . ( I 'm glad to say the bats are in no danger from this zapper due to the grid guard , btw . ) I 've had this 80 watt model for over 3 months now , and it works beautifully even though it 's exposed to the wind , rain , and hail . Depending on how warm the weather has been , I 'll take the leaf blower to it to clean the bug zapper every week or two . With the leaf blower , the bug zapper swings around wildly , but it does n't damage this sturdy bug zapper ! All bugs come off easily.I also have this zapper on a light-sensitive timer , so it comes on at dusk , and off again at dawn .	1
I love hearing the zap zap zap . Have been using this thing in South Florida for over a year now , and left it out to brave quite a few storms , and it 's still going on strong .	1
For all the negatives , I am giving it 4 stars because it does it job so well.Pros : -It does it job well.Cons : -Power cord is not even a foot long . You will always need an extension.-Loud , but I do n't know any effective zappers without that kind of noise especially when it get bigger insects-It does not have a pan to catch the insects so expect to see a little mess at the foot of the zapper.-Not a very attractive design	1
This thing is a bug terminator zapping any bug that comes in . At first it got pretty clogged up ( lots of bugs in FL ) but the lizards and frogs have done a nice job cleaning it up for me . It & # 8217 ; s to me a necessity here if you want piece from the mosquitos .	1
Ca n't speak to the 1 acre coverage , but , it does the job for the back deck . Not as loud as other bug zappers we 've had and that 's a good thing .	1
We just received this unit this week , and can already note an improvement in our yard . We have used dunks for some water gardens we have , and have been impressed with the Flowtron unit thus far . A lot of dead mosquitoes every morning . We hook it up to an outdoor timer and run the unit automatically from dusk to dawn . It will take about three weeks for all the eggs to hatch and mature then we 'll see a great reduction in mosquitoes.It 's been a very wet in North Texas and we have a bumper crop this year . Am going to explore mixing up some hot pepper and garlic -- recipes are available online as a barrier . We hope a combination on factors can help rid us of a heavy mosquito population . Have not noticed any beneficial insects on or under the grids.We compared brands and sizes and selected this one due to reviews of others on Amazon . Recommend the bigger wattage for better attraction of flying insects -- with mosquitoes being our main target .	1
We found the 80D not much more to buy than the 1/2 acre 40D , and it likely does provide a wider area of coverage . It will use more electricity , but I intend to put it on a sensor , so it will run dusk to dawn . As others reported , we found a pile of carnage after the first night ... .mostly mosquitoes . Read the instructions about locating and baiting ... .ours is forty feet upwind of our hot tub , patio , and screened porch so the black light and scent bait draws bugs away from us , and intercepts those coming from upwind . Far enough away from food and guests to avoid the health hazards reported , and the & # 34 ; zapping & # 34 ; is not obtrusively loud.Ours arrived with a small plastic tab laying in the bottom of the tray . Investigating , I discovered a self-tapping screw had cross-threaded during assembly , breaking off one of four tabs used to secure the safety cage . This would not have easily been detected by Quality Control at Flowtron . I contacted Parts and Service . They had me email my Amazon receipt , and immediately sent me a replacement cage . Nice service !	1
We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy 's Ives Road Fen Preserve . They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling . After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear . After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them . We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas . In seven years two blades have broken . Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website . A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use . These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found . The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener .	1
At first I did n't like this Corona pruner because it did n't seem to cut well . Then I realized the source of the problem was me . I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles , so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil . User error . Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position , but also the blade tended to twist . Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V. That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well . Not sure why the difference , but there it is . So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide , and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces .	1
I needed some loppers to cut some branches on some trees , decided to go with these because of the price and all the positive feedback . They work flawlessly and now I can keep my house trees trimmed to where I want them .	1
Corona makes the best quality gardening equipment . I own pruning saws as well as the hand pruners . Most importantly they last forever ! I have experienced so many other brands that give out after just a little use .	1
I have used a number of pruners , but these are my fav . Sharp and powerful . Like the fact that you can sharpen them rather easily extending their value and lifespan . Great for all my needs .	1
I really love these pruners . They are heavy duty ( up to 1 inch ) . They are more reasonable than some similar Felco pruners I bought ( which are also good ) . I recommend these .	1
These clippers are great . Easy to grip and sharp enough to really get the job done . I like the locking hook that keeps them closed when not being used . Also , the red handles are a big help to spot them when you 've laid them down among your clippings .	1
I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners . Finally , my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners . I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this , and I 'm glad I did . I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes . The handle felt comfortable in my ( fairly small ) hands , it has n't stuck or jammed , and they feel like they 're made to last . Thanks for steering me right , other reviewers . : )	1
I recently purchased these pruners in a package that contains a second pruner that also cuts string and opens boxes . Lifetime guarantee , and both at the local Costco cost the same as the one on Amazon .	1
I am a landscape contractor and we use a lot of different hand tools . There are a number of very pricey pruners out there but I have found that these operate extremely well at a fraction of the cost of some others . They are forged heavy grade pruners with nice grips . Just keep the blades oiled and clean .	1
this is a very good product . i laid it on top of 4 metal fence posts at the corners of my strawberry bed . it is surprisingly strong . it gets snagged on just about everything , but does not rip . it keeps the birds and cats out of my strawberries . i will be buying more in the future .	1
The local bird population was eating all the raspberries a day or two before they were ripe enough for us . This thwarted them ! It is a bit tricky to put on by oneself . I recommend at least two people if you have much of a span to cover . We will be buying more .	1
We made a PVC `` greenhouse '' framework and stretched this over it to keep birds and hornworm moths out . So far , it 's working pretty well.Great stuff . Can get hung up on the roll when you 're rolling up what you do n't need . Cheap enough to throw away at the end of the season without pain .	1
Okay , I 'm not using this netting like the other folk , but perhaps you too are looking for a solution to THAT deer that 's so bold he does n't hesitate to come up onto the porch to nibble the delicious buds off your potted plants.My particular problem this year was n't that , but it was that someone was dining on the new garden I put in the front yard . Now , you ca n't exactly put up deer fencing -- at least not attractively -- at the front of your lawn , but you can protect your plants , it turns out , with this netting.What I did was cut the netting into small swaths which I lay over the plants . LOL , it apparently has an unpleasant feel on the tongue . The dear deer has n't even eaten the lettuces I 've got tucked in here and there . And the best part is that the netting is invisible . At least I ca n't see it.So try this out and see if it works for you . It 's allowed us to grow plants that none of our neighbors dare try here in deer-country Virginia.One note of caution : You need to check periodically to make sure that blossoms do n't work themselves into the netting . I 've had to work some free so they could open.Pam T~happy gardenerI 'll report back if there 's a failure at any point	1
When I first got this thing , I must admit , I was really dubious . It looks odd and gimmicky . Well , using it in my garden has turned me into a believer ! It works great on my thick , clay-heavy soil - quickly cultivating the ground , breaking it up and preparing for my attentions . It works great and I highly recommend it ! ( Review of Garden Weasel Gold Garden Claw Cultivator # 91306 )	1
I planned to use the Garden Claw for stand-up cultivation of my raised beds , and it will be great for that ; it 's perfect for SFG-style beds.But this is the best part : I 've discovered it 's perfect for helping me dig post holes for my grape and kiwi trellises . I 'm a 4'10 '' disabled woman with bad knees and a bad back . I just do n't have the upper body strength to ram a post-hole digger into the clay soil in our fescue-matted field , and the two big , strong men in my household always have something more pressing to do.I discovered the Garden Claw makes a circular hole that 's just a tad wider than the post-hole digger does , and I can loosen six or more inches of clay soil and roots in no time . Without strain ! Then I can use the post-hole digger to lift out the loosened soil , or I can just spade it out into a bucket for use somewhere else . As weak as I am , I can get two 2-foot holes dug before I have to rest.I 've been frustrated because I 've been too broke to pay someone to come put these trellises in and worried because I know the vines will be here before I know it . Thanks to the Garden Claw , I can put in my trellises all by myself ! It paid for itself the very first day . So far , I 'm delighted with it .	1
I bought my garden claw several years ago . I was looking for something to help turn compost into my vegetable gardens.The criterion I was looking for was something inexpensive that would n't break the bank the way a tiller would . But would still get the job done without causing me to be laid up with back pain for a week . For the most part I have been very pleased.We have 2- 12'x12 ' , and 2-8'x8 ' beds along with a few smaller freestyle plots , and we mainly use the claw to add compost and cow manure to them every Spring . With the claw I am able to quickly mix in my amendments , and to loosen up the soil about a half foot down in next to no time . If I want to go extra deep , it does take a double dose of clawing , but it is worth it in the end . And it really is not that much extra work since the soil has been pre-loosened a bit by the first go around.As far as starting a bed from scratch , I have used it to start new plots , but only after the sod has been removed . I do think it would be a tough chore to try to do a new bed from start to finish , with only the Claw , and without removing the grass first , but not impossible.When weeding I find it invaluable for use in between rows . It is a breeze to simply stick the claw into the center of a clump of weeds and give a twist and a tug and be done.My one complaint is that the handle has come a tad bit loose . It is still perfectly functional and it took about 5 or more years of good solid use for that to happen , but for someone with a larger plot who uses it more often it may be a concern .	1
This is a handy tool for cultivating small areas , but it is not appropriate for anything more than a medium sized flowerbed . The handles work well to gain leverage , but you will feel it in your muscles if you attempt to do too large an area ! The fact that it is n't powered lets you get into areas you would n't want to go with even the smallest of tillers , and it does a great job of breaking up the ground to a depth of a couple of inches , which is perfect for flowers.For larger projects , use a mini-tiller , and use this tool for the detail work and the smaller beds . Both tools are a good combination to have at your disposal .	1
Everyone I know advised me against getting a reel mower . I was cautioned that they do n't cut well and they 're hard to push . But I did n't consider a gas mower an option ( too expensive , noisy , hard to maintain , and dangerous ) , a corded electric would be too cumbersome , and a rechargeable would be impractical because there is not a convenient place for me to charge it . So I took the plunge and bought this one.I 'm completely intimidated by all things mechanical , so I was worried about assembling this mower , but it really is easy . The only thing you have to do is screw the five sections of the handle together , then clip it onto the mower body . The instructions were adequate ( 3.5 stars there ) , even for an assembly-phobe like me . The current configuration does not require any tools for assembly , but there was an add-on bag of washers and nuts included with my mower that are recommended for a more securely assembled handle . If you opt to use the new nuts instead of the original wingnuts , you 'll need a wrench.After just fifteen minutes or so , I was up and running . To my delight , the mower pushes easily , even through long grass . And it 's very entertaining to watch the grass being rapidly snipped off . I felt like Edward Scissorhands . Who would have thought mowing grass would be so fun ? I was a little tired and winded when I finished ( in a good way ) , but I had been practically running with this thing because I enjoyed it so much . I kept looking for stray patches to go over again , but , alas , the mower did such a good job , when I was finished , my yard looked like a golf course.A few facts about me and my lawn to see if my wholehearted recommendation will apply to you : I 'm female , plus-sized , totally out of shape , and usually quite sedentary ( one reason I thought this would be a good idea ) . I had never mowed grass before in my life ( did n't have a yard before last summer , and then I accepted the fine services of a neighborhood girl with a ride-on mower who worked cheap ) . My yard is about 6500 square feet , level , fairly flat , and covered with long pine needles all over the place ( the mower did n't even notice them ) .Some older reviews address a couple of problems that are no longer an issue : Scotts now ( late April 2007 ) packages the mower with the cushioned handgrip already on , and the apparently easily loosened wingnuts ( as already mentioned ) can now be replaced with regular nuts ( not mentioned in the current manual , but included in the box with a note ) . Scotts should have included shorter bolts with the new nuts ( since you now do n't need the extra length the wingnuts required ) , but this is a trivial point . Put your wingnuts on after the new nuts for a more `` finished '' appearance.A reel mower might not be suitable for everyone and every yard , but for me , it 's fantastic . It 's quiet , easy to maneuver , non-intimidating , good exercise , fun , environmentally sound , and inexpensive . I could n't be happier with this mower.UPDATE 1-17-13I used my mower for the whole season and never had any problems with it . The next year , health issues forced me to again use the services of the neighborhood girl to mow my lawn . Then I got married , and my husband wanted nothing to do with a reel mower ( though he admitted that it was cool , he 'd always used a gas mower , and that 's what he wanted to stick with , though I HATE the noise and smell when he mows ) . So my Scotts sat in storage for years , and last fall Hubby finally convinced me to let it go . I sold it for $ 50 to a single mom with a tween daughter who was going to mow their small lawn . I let them try it out on our grass , and they were both immediately thrilled and could n't wait to get home to use it . I felt like I was kind of passing on a torch . There 's something wonderfully enabling about this mower . If I found myself again being the person responsible for mowing a small-to-medium-size lawn , I would definitely buy another one of these .	1
It 's a classic all right , but a clever classic . This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches . That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let 's you know that someone gave some thought to this device . One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it . Well , you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade or even the angle of the cut ; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag , far more than the grass did . Once you 've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate ( remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades ) it 'll be close to effortless . The main thing , however , is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut .	1
Works like a charm . Put it together in a few minutes and cut an overgrown yard at a cabin . Had to make two passes - one at the highest length and one at desired length . The tall weeds did not cut , but I cut them with a lopper . Much easier to maneuver than my power mower and trimmer-mower .	1
I have had many people look at and watch me as I mowed our lawn for the first time with this reel mower and all I could think is that these people think I 'm going green ... well I 'm not . I have always lived a conservative life , recycled ( still do ) , and so on . And not because some celebrity told me I should or whatever , but because it just makes sense to do so . So with that out of the way , onto the actual product.When gas prices peaked last summer we stopped using our lawn tractor because it used just too much gas ( and it did n't cut the grass all that well to begin with ) and just used our self propelled Honda mower . Well after the tractor sat all summer we decided to just sell it and buy a reel mower and so far it has more then paid for itself.The first question EVERYONE asks is , is it hard to push ? Plain and simple , NO . These new reel mowers are lighter and are better designed so they are much easier to push then the old Leave It To Beaver style reel mowers . Also the rear stabilizer wheels also makes it easier to handle.The second question that is asked is , how well does it cut the grass . Well that depends on how tall the grass is , how wet it is , etc.. A reel mower cuts with a sheering action ( like scissors ) instead of a tearing action that is associated with a rotary mower . This leaves your grass in a much healthier state then the tearing action does . Now I will say that it is harder to cut tall grass and we have to mow more often , but that 's the nature of the beast.After mowing the lawn for a few weeks with the Scotts 20 inch reel mower I can actually tell a difference in the grass , much better and healthier looking.The only gripe I have is the handle is a bit flimsy and wobbles a lot ... kind of a pain when you execute a turn . We 'll probably end up welding it together so it does n't wobble.All said and done it 's a bit more work then using our self propelled Honda , but produces a much better looking lawn.Pros : Fairly cheap upfront cost.Little to no upkeep.Leaves your lawn looking awesome.At least ten times quieter then pretty much any rotary mower , thus allows your to keep your windows open when you are mowing.No fumes ( darnit I love the smell of gas ! ) .20 '' mower path.Cons : Made in China ... Some plastic pieces , not sure how they are going to last but we 'll see.Wobbly handle .	1
I really like this mower a lot . I have owned a Brill and Sunlawn , but I like the Scotts classic better than either . I do have a 40 year old Scotts Deluxe that is substantially heavier and which I like the best of all . I use the old Scotts Deluxe for mowing my own yard and leave the Scotts classic in my trunk to mow rentals . Here are my pros and cons.Pros.1 . Heavier than others . That makes it less likely to slip when going over uneven lawn or wet grass . It also has more reel momentum making it cut tall floppy grass and leaves better.2 . Handle comes off easily . There are little clips that hold the handle in , but I do not use them . I just pop the handle on and off , making it easy to store in my trunk and use any time.3 . No gas , much , much lighter and smaller than a gas mower . Of course this is true of all reel mowers , but it is an important point for me . I can leave this in my trunk and not worry about gas fumes or about refilling gas . It is always ready to go . With the handle off , it does not take up too much of my trunk and it is light enough to easily take in and out of my trunk.4 . Durable . You might not think of this with a reel mower , but it saves me nice money in maintenance . I actually mow several rental lawns weekly . With that much mowing I have to take my mower in for maintenance every year . Also I have bent the crankshaft on multiple mowers . The only maintenance on this is sharpening the blade.5 . Easy to sharpen the blade . This mower is made by American Lawn Mower , which means it can use the very easy , very cheap american lawn mower sharpening kit available from amazon and tons of other places for under $ 20 . I like the kit and feel I get a better cut with this mower than I did with the brill or sunlawn models.6 . Quiet . Maybe it is a little louder than the brill , but it is still super quiet . If I feel like mowing in the middle of the night , just because I can , I do and it bothers noone . Now when I use a gas mower , the noise really bothers me.Cons.1 . Handle is super flexy . They really cheaped out on the handle . The sunlawn and brill models are much stronger . It works and lasted a heavy use season , but it will not last as long as the body.2 . Tough time with weeds . Like all reel mowers , this thing does not like to mow anything that is tall and floppy . This one handles weeds and tall grass much better than average , but you should still try to hold down the weeds and cut weekly if possible . That being said my sister often forgets to mow her weedy lawn for a few weeks , and I am able to mow it with my Scotts classic when her sunlawn would have more difficulty .	1
I wish I could say that I purchased this mower after seeing Al Gores `` inconvenient truth '' and my life was changed by it . The truth however is that I finally got fed up with my old power mower failing to start for the ump-teenth time after repeated repairs and promises of it now `` running like a champ '' . This old time mower will take some getting used too , and also do n't kid yourself , it does n't do the job as easily as a power mower by any means . However on the plus side you will never again suffer through a mower that fails you , needs fuel , requires any real maintenance like oil changes or plugs , and best of all if you take care of it , will be the very last mower you ever buy . The only way this mower will up and quit is if you do . Any maintenance it does require is easily handled by a screwdriver or wrench . Even for those whose knowledge of small gas engines does n't go much beyond kicking it and swearing when it disappoints you . I fully agree with the reviewer here who stated it is best used on pristine lawns with lush healthy grass . ( Unfortunately a lot of people that have lawns of such quality often do n't cut their own lawns . If you happen to be the exception , read on ) This mower cuts thick grass of reasonable length straight and evenly very easily . Where it fails you is on long loose weeds fluttering in the wind . The mower passes right over them no matter how many times you try again and again to sever it . I solved that problem by putting a little more effort into trimming with the weed whacker , and leaving the heavy grass to the mower . And it by far is most efficient when used regularly once or twice a week . A time table you will find effortlessly fits most peoples lifestyle since the mower is so light and easy to use that mowing the lawn will no longer be an all day Saturday event . Unlike lawns where power mowers are used that usually get long and seedy looking in between jobs , you will find yourself taking this mower out far more often just to hit the `` high spots '' . Thus your lawn comes to have the appearance of a man that gets his hair cut every three weeks and thus never looks like he is long overdue . You can also get away with using this mower early in the morning or late in the evening since it makes very little racket . And one last thing , I did n't notice much difference in the physical effort needed to push it considering that most people use walk behind push mowers in any event . Aside from having to use it a little more often , and its lack of cutting power on long weeds , I consider this mower to be well worth one 's investment . You will eventually come to find your lawn never looked better .	1
I ordered my Scotts 20 '' Classic Mower on Earth Day and because I had to put it together , I finally used it for the first time in mid-May . I wish all I had to do was put in two screws and be done but there were 5 big pieces to the handle and lots of little pieces ( fortunately almost all the same set of pieces ) . I could put it together with only a little difficulty and I do n't have much practice at putting things together . I could n't get the E-rings in . My husband managed that.The handle flexes . I wondered if that was needed to handle the bumps , but after using it I do n't think it is . I think it is just cheap . The mower part feels more substantial . It is made in China . I wonder how many years of not using my gas mower it will take to make up for transporting this from China.In the reviews people talked about it stopping suddenly . I had the same issue . I have a very small yard ; it is level except for a few odd little depressions . At those spots as well as at random moments the mower would freeze up . It happened some times when the clippings kind of got clogged on the back guard . Other times , I could not see why it stopped . It went right over the small sticks in my yard , which I was happy about . On the other hand , all the dandelions just bent over and snapped right back up after I passed over them . I had a few spots where I went at the grass from a few directions before it mowed . Once I got it going it tended to keep going , but every corner meant a full stop and then had to try to get ` er rolling again . Next time , I 'll see if I can figure out a way to mow with less full corners . As I said it is a small yard , so I 'm not sure it will work.Overall I am happy with the product except for the issues I mentioned above . I did n't want to spend too much , so for the price this is about what I expected . I plan to use this every other time I mow . I 'm keeping the gas mower to get through the weeds and plants that are out of control . As I 'm growing more native plants and food , my area of grass is decreasing .	1
I was not sure if this mower would work for me , seeing as my lawn is & # 34 ; too big & # 34 ; , bumpy , and pretty weedy as I do n't use chemicals on it . But I took the chance and am very glad I did . It 's much easier to manage than the gas mower I was using ( not self propelled ) , and does a good job on the lawn . If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you , but I do n't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there . The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs , which was another concern of mine . I mow each & # 34 ; section & # 34 ; of my lawn once per week , so the grass does not get too high . Also I switch mowing directions each time . If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably is n't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass . Using this mower might take me a bit longer than using the gas powered one , but not by much . And it 's a whole lot quieter and easier to maintain .	1
I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards , although that was n't always the case . When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old , heavy manual mower , something that soured me on manual mowers for decades . But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers , and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower , but without the noise , the vibrations or the fumes . I can mow at 7 in the morning , or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors , too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it : It 's light , easy to push , fairly easy to adjust , and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit . That alone will save a bit of money . It 's my favorite unit in its price class . ( My favorite mower is the Brill , from Germany , which is even lighter and easier to push than the Scott and does n't require sharpening for 8 years , but which Amazon does n't carry ... yet . ) If you do buy the Scott , get the sharpening kit , as when you do need it you 'll want to have it on hand . And get a can of Boeshield protectant spray ( also available from Amazon ) . A quick once over with the Boeshield from time to time will greatly extend the life of your mower and keep it easy to push .	1
I have about six-thousand square feet of lawn . This mower handles it quite well . There 's some effort to push it , but it 's actually easier in some ways than using a power mower ; for example , the lighter weight of this mower makes it far easier to change directions in a tight space . It 's easy to adjust the height of the cut , as well.I 'll just note one small problem that I 've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type . There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle . On mine , it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower , which is n't a big deal . Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass . Mine leaves long grass uncut . I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general . Also , it 's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself , simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn , and this , in turn , makes it more likely that you 'll skid on any mud . With those limitations , however , I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower .	1
It 's 9:00am on a beautiful Saturday morning . The air is a little cool but the sun feels warm on my skin . The Northern Cardinals are singing and I hear a Golden Fronted Woodpecker chirping in the tree above my head . As I sit on my back porch and sip my coffee I feel content and happy.Then , my next door neighbor fires up his ridiculously over-sized riding lawn mower . A few minutes later the guy behind me joins in . I head inside . Another Saturday morning ruined . I decide to make a point . Later that day the neighbor is hosting a bar-b-que in his backyard . As he is tending the grill I chat with him for a while . He has over 30 guests and they are all having fun talking to each other and laughing . I announce that it is time for me to mow my yard . His eyes get big and he stammers `` N..n..now ? '' Yep . I roll out my brand newScotts Push Reel Lawn Mowerand start mowing right next to his fence . None of his guests even noticed . He happily offered me a beer and a brat when I was done . This mower makes life better.EDIT : I received aFiskars reel mowera month ago through the Amazon Vine program and , to be honest , I like it better . I still like the Scotts but the Fiskars is easier to use and requires less maintenance .	1
I like this . No need for gas and it cuts very nicely . I use it in south carolina and my yard is not big . It is good for my application . Good work out !	1
We purchased a chicago 2-flat about a year ago . I bought a used $ 10 reel mower that was awful , but got us through the dry summer last year . I knew we would need a new one this year . After watching for sales that never happened I turned to trusty amazon . So far , I 'm completely satisfied with this lil guy ! We have a relatively small yard , so the 14 inch width is completely appropriate . I also was super impressed at the way it handled long grass . I know these mowers are notorious for not being able to handle it , but I was pretty pleased . It may not have cut the long grass like a gas mower , but it really was completely acceptable . Like a few other reviewers have said it does get stuck on any little twig . So you might have to stop a few times to bend over and pick them out , but if you 're the reel mower type I would assume bending over a few times is n't out of the question . You ca n't beat the price either ! I had no issue with the assembly , it took just a few minutes . After watching my neighbor reel over his in short strokes to get through the yard I was even more glad that I have this guy !	1
I am a avid gardener , I take care of the flowers and my husband takes care of the lawn . We have had too many cases of lawmmower blight ; by definition - the weed wacker or lawn mower cuts down my flowers and bushes . After too many cases of lawnmower blight , I bought this little mower for trimming near my flower beds that are naturalized ( lawnmower blight does not happen at mulched beds ) .This is a great tool ! Very sharp and easy to push , perfect for what I need it for . At first my husband was slightly insulted by and for the reason of this pruchase , he even snickered when it came out of the box , but when he tried it he loved it and is now using it to trim by our driveway as is cuts lower than our `` big '' mower.Highly recommend for very small lawns and trimming , remember it is 14 inches wide.I JUST LOVE IT1	1
Winter is not the most appropriate time to review a new lanmower , but the truth is that the ( coarse ) grass was around 6 inches tall . It took two passes but got mowed very nicely . I think this one 's a keeper .	1
Works great , I needed this to start impatiens seeds from Burpee -- they 're so small they resemble grains of sand , you actually dip a toothpick in water and use the surface tension to pick up and deposit each seed -- THAT 'S SMALL . Keep the transparent lid on until the seeds have mostly sprouted , then remove the lid and slowly `` harden off '' the plants by exposing them to the outdoors and eventually sunlight over time.I wish I 'd ordered two or more of these . It 's much , much cheaper to start flowers from seed on your own versus buying them at the local Home Depot or nursery . I already ordered more impatiens and I have some vincas I want to get started for the warmer months . Buy some decent potting mix or seed starting mix , or if you 're really crunchy granola run some garden soil through your oven @ about 350 degrees for an hour to sterilize it . I like to add some perlite to soil mixes . I also like to water the soil BEFORE THE SEEDS ARE SOWN with Miracle Gro . The transparent dome will maintain humidity while the seeds are sprouting . I 'd use a decent plant mister ( Could n't insert product link , URL is http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010H748S/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details ) to keep the seedlings content.Great product . I really wish I 'd ordered two or three of them .	1
Very convenient and easy to start seedlings . They are sturdy and I have reused them more than once . I recommend these .	1
I purchased this item locally at a discount store for much less , so be sure to check around before you buy.I purchased two , knowing that with my history I 'd be lucky with 10 percent actually sprouting . But I was wrong ! My granddaughter and I did the first tray together . She poured the water , then I counted out the seeds for her to plant . Her Mom and I did the second tray after she got bored . Within three days the first of the plants were up . It has now been 8 days and nearly every pellet has seedlings . I have already had to move the first ones ( cantaloupe ) to a large peat pot since they are five inches tall ! I am using one of the top covers under the four large peat pots.Almost all of the others are 2 inches tall , but still fragile.This will be my first garden grown completely from seed , and I will definitely use this again next year ! Edited , All of the plants are in the ground and doing well ! Tomatoes are sprawling all over the place , Zucchini have flowers , even the cantaloupe are starting to perk up now that the weather is warmer .	1
This is my second germination set I 've ordered in the last two weeks . This one is even flimsier than the other one by Hydrofarms . However , the concept works : place peat pots of seeds in a warm , humid environment and seeds will sprout . I have mine on a heating pad under a grow lamp . The peat pots only expanded to just under an inch.An aluminum pan with a clear lid would work just as well , as the metal would distribute the heat better . I found the lid popped off easily so I check on it several times a day . I have beans and turnips growing in my peat pots.With care I intend to reuse the pan and lid for multiple uses . For new gardeners this is an effective way to grow seeds . I could also place peat pots in sealed plastic bags for cheaper , though . I will report back in a week when the first seeds sprout .	1
You ca n't beat the price for this kit and it 's so easy to start seeds . I used this for the first time last year and followed planting and disk instructions and had over a 75 % germination rate ! Between the cost and ease-of-use , this is a great way to start seeds for outdoors . Just keep the little pellets moist and you 'll be good to go.Some seeds need dark to germinate , so make sure to read your seed packets !	1
I 've used this and a few other similar Jiffy products the last several years to start seeds for my garden . They are very easy to use ( add hot water per the directions to expand the included pellets , then plant seeds per packet instructions ) and less messy than using seed starting mix in flats -- and perhaps even easier as well , though probably a bit more expensive . A clear plastic cover/dome is included to help germination . When the seedlings are ready to pot up or transplant , the netting tears off very easily and allows for transplanting with minimal root disturbance . Some people also leave the netting on and I seem to remember reading that it 's supposed to disintegrate , but that has n't been my experience . You do have to be careful with larger-rooted plants ( squash , etc . ) that you take care of them before their roots start to grow through the netting , otherwise you 'll probably shock them more if/when you remove it . Finally , I like the square shape of this tray because it allows me to evenly rotate the plants under my grow lights.However , there are a few things you should know that do n't seem to be made clear . Jiffy sells refill pellets so you can use the tray again , ideally saving money -- but they have several similar-looking products that take different-sized pellets , so you need to know which ones you need . This 25-cell tray takes 42mm pellets ( not 30 , 36 , or 50mm , which they also sell ) . Jiffy sells the 25-pack ofJiffy 5777 Refills , which are the right size . They used to be almost as expensive on Amazon as this complete kit , but as of my writing they are now an add-on item for about half the cost . Beware of third-party sellers ; for example , I see a 200-pack of supposedly 42mm pellets , Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets , but they were actually the wrong size , so I had to return them . You may also be able to find them locally . Just be sure you get the right size , which is the 42mm size , sold under the `` Jiffy 5777 '' name . Jiffy does not make sizing clear on either the original product or the refill , both of which would be a great help.Finally , I will note that because of the availability of refills , I was hoping to save money by re-using the tray for a few years and just replacing the pellets . However , after saving two trays from last season ( both inside under good , climate-controlled conditions ) , one became slightly warped and curled up towards the outside , making it undesirable for use since I 'm not sure if my plants would fall over with this slight curl of the tray . It also developed a small crack in the bottom , which is important to be aware of if you 're using ( and watering ) these inside as I assume most people do . Obviously , these are just thin plastic and not something I 'd expect to keep for years and years , but I was hoping to at least get a couple years ' use out them . This works better sometimes than others.In summary , I 've used this product for a couple years now , and it 's definitely become my favorite method for most plants . I plan to continue to use this product for as long as it 's available -- just be warned about refill sizes , and perhaps be careful about how the tray is stored if you 're hoping to re-use it for the next season .	1
A family of field mice moved into the house . They are soooo tiny I was n't sure what trap to use but this looked the lightest . I caught the whole family within a few hours - even the babies . The secret as many have already said is keep in in their path and along the wall - I knew where they were coming from so it made that part easy . Also , like already mentioned - just a dap of peanut butter - especially if trying to catch small mice .	1
We have several traps to deal with the mice that love our garage - this trap works well , but the one improvement would be to have the case transparent so you can see the contents . When the mouse goes in , the trap rocks and the door closes and latches - this all works well , but the trap frequently closes without a mouse .	1
Having read reviews of several different live traps , had no idea which was best . So , bought about 4 different ones . THIS ONE WORKED . Put them all out with peanut butter and had no sign of any activity except this one . Did n't know how many mice we had , but caught three with this one and zero with the others and no escapes , it seems , from the others . They were all put in the same general area . This one worked , was easy to set , easy to bait and easy to release the mouse .	1
This works well , but you can not tell if it just tripped or if caught any.Sometimes it is tripped empty and that locks the door so it has to be reset before it can catch again . On the other hand , this is really low-cost and you can buy a lot more .	1
This chain fit great for my Poulan Pro electric saw . This is also an older company that has a great website to help identify exactly what model your specific saw requires . It is not directional , so you do n't have to worry about any arrows facing the right way . I just used it and I forgot how powerful my saw was . Getting old ones sharpened can be questionable when new ones are this cheap .	1
I HAVE A 18 '' CRAFTSMAN CHAIN SAW THAT CAME WITH A OREGON CHAIN THAT I HIT DIRT AND DULLED IT REAL FAST.THIS REPLACEMENT CHAIN FITS AND WORKS JUST AS WELL AS THE ONE IT CAME WITH AND IS ALSO HALF THE PRICE OF SEARS .	1
This chain fit my Poulan 18 & # 34 ; chainsaw perfectly and was wicked sharp . The price was just a fraction of what I would have paid at a hardware or Tractor Supply store .	1
as advertised ... .. Oregon Chainsaw always delivers a good product . I 've bought lots of their chainsaw chains over the years and have n't ever been disappointed with the quality ... ... good product ... ... ... .	1
Nice quality replacement chain and fit perfectly . Seems to hold its sharpness better than the chain that came with the saw . I find it less trouble to just replace the chain rather than try to sharpen them .	1
It was half the price of the same chain at Sears and came in two days . It saved me a ride and I have a pile of wood .	1
Bought two for different chainsaw models and am pleased with the quality of the chains.Sharp as new ! Excellent price . Just be sure your chainsaw is compatible !	1
I switched from a skip tooth chain to this semi chisel and it cuts much faster and less vibration . On my 40 volt electric saw it really makes a difference .	1
I buy these chains at my local hardware store for about the same price as Amazon charges . They work perfectly for my Husqvarna chain saw . Be careful to make sure you get the correct chain . There are many different variations on 16 '' chains , and just knowing the brand of the saw does n't tell you which will be the correct one .	1
This S56 chain fits my Makita UC4030A electric chain saw . Price is cheaper than Home depot by about 6 dollars . At this price I will keep a few on hand and sharpen them later . Oregon 's web site lists what chains fit which saws .	1
Do not assume from this listing that the S56 16-inch saw chain will fit your 16-inch saw ! ! If a photo of the back of the package were also included in this listing , you could zoom in and verify which models of the brands listed on the front view it will actually fit ( Well Duh ! ! ) . Additionally , while listings for some other Oregon chains advise we use the selector guide found at Oregonchain.com , most do not ! Oregon makes an excellent saw chain . Each and every listing should prominently provide explicit instruction that potential buyers need to first verify the correct selection for their particular make & model , before ordering . Do they look at all those questions customers post ( will this fit my xxx model of my xxx brand ) ? My father 's Remington 16-inch electric , Model 1630A actually requires the S58 , even though entering that make and model into Amazon 's Search field brought us directly to this listing . Unfortunately , we only discovered the mismatch when our shipment arrived and we found that it was not listed on the back of the carton containing the chain . A visit to the Oregon website ( also suggested on the carton but nowhere in this listing ) revealed that the S58 is the correct choice ... ..even though the description and photo of the S58 at Amazon states `` Fits Echo , John Deere and Sears Chain Saws '' with no reference to Remington ! ! ! The Amazon listing for S58 contained an advisory to first check the selector guide at Oregon . That advisory is not included on this listing ! So , it did not do me much good to shop on Amazon versus visiting the local `` big box store '' when their listing resulted in the shipment & my return of the wrong product ! Are you going to reimburse my time/ $ $ to return 3 chains ? Come on guys ! Do you really monitor the responses to your `` Did we miss anything ? '' links ? UPDATE ( 12.7.2013 ) : Well ! I have already heard back on my return ( it really pays to use the `` return function '' that can be found under your `` orders history '' ) and have received a complete refund ! ! The email reply also promised this issue would be forwarded through channels . Hopefully , this will result in a hyperlink being inserted below , with an advisory to first verify exactly which chain fits your saw make and model . BIG TIP NOT EMPHASIZED ENOUGH EVEN AT THE SELECTOR SITE : `` count the number of drive links in the chain you have now , and write that number down someplace where you can find it '' . S56 chain has 56 drive links while S58 ( and our Remington 's old chain ) has 58 ! ! I my case , the selector guide gave 4 different alternatives of 58 drive link chains for the electric saw we use behind the garage to cut up wood for splitting . Since I have years of seasonal experience , and use a large , gas-powered , chain saw with an aggressive style of Oregon chain to fell and section trees in the woods , we chose the aggressive style chain ( WARNING : this = `` far greater chance for kick-back and IS NOT for the unwary user '' ) which was also available at Amazon.com ( not the S58 but the 91VXL058G ) .Lastly , this disappointment is one of the very few I have experienced in my many years and many $ $ spent as a customer of Amazon . I use Oregon chains on my big Stihl saw , and have found that they cut a long time before dulling , and can be filed or re-sharpened many times over . Recommend them highly.PS to the guy with the Poulan Pro ... OMG ! ! ! For kicks and giggles , I looked up your saw on the selector guide . There were some 15 or more choices and some were 56 link and others 58 link . Yours is the best example I can see , where knowing to count drive links on the current chain is soooooooo important .	1
I 've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow & # 34 ; flowers & # 34 ; come out too easily and get lost . This resulted in wasps , bees , etc being able to drink the liquid . I had used it a few years and am supposing they are n't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far . Otherwise , great feeder with large capacity . It is very heavy , so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb .	1
I do n't have any problems with this and neither do the birds . We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives , they really do n't care that the water is n't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway , I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it , then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors ( sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet , ask me how I know ) .I have not found it difficult to clean . Once refilled I take it out again , still upside down , and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out . Then just screw it back in to the cap .	1
I 've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears . I 've tried decorative blown-glass ones , lightweight plastics ones , and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies , including Garden Treasures and this one , Perky Pets . I 've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards . If I could keep away ants , then I could n't dissuade the bees . And ultimately , each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods . Finally , however , I think I 've found The One , although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details : the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar , far more than my single family of hummingbirds ( now four in all ) can consume in a week , the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside . Its size , however , gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning . The single-piece plastic base has six , yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it . It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging . It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak , as many other models do , because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic . The disadvantage of that is , of course , that you can not get inside of it to clean . I 've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even , in rare cases , only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling , the inside remains clean and mold-free . I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports . Like many hummingbird feeders , this one only addresses one pest problem , bees , so you 'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard . Because this feeder hangs with a wire , which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing , I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it , making it necessary to remove both , as a single unit , when refilling . Also , when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it , you 'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground , so do it in a location where it does n't matter . To continue keeping bees away , make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version ( 4 parts water , boiled , to 1 part sugar ) . There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I 'm giving this feeder five stars because it 's the best I 've encountered after eight or so attempts . It 's not perfect , but it 's darn close. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
I am using this with the Audubon Hummingbird Food packets . It is easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning . I am in a serious competition in my neighborhood with many hummingbird feeders and mine is quite popular . We can sit on our deck and within a few feet the hummers come and feed and are interested only in that and hassling each other .	1
THEY LOVE THIS ONE . IT 'S THE CADILAC OF FEEDERS . IF MOLD BUILDS UP IN THE GLASS JUST FILL WITH DILUTE CLORINE BLEACH AND LET STAND FOR A FEW HOURS . IT WILL CLEAN IT UP.AND WHEN YOU FILL IT TRY AND STAND VERY STILL BY THE FEEDER AND YOU CAN OBSERVE THEM FROM ONLY INCHES AWAY . IF YOU DO N'T MOVE , THEY CA N'T SEE YOU . BUT DO N'T TOUCH . THEY 'RE MUCH TOO FRAGILE .	1
July 28 , 2012 Update '' Talk about discrimination . Our bunch so far this year has grown to 5 and they are just as much fun to watch as before . This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard 's other two feeders . The key to this year 's success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full . I am here to simply order two more . I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.April 29 , 2012 : They 're back and still as beautiful as ever . This year so far only two have shown up and I can not determine their sex or anything . They are still skittish and will not come to me as in the past . It takes time . They use these Perky-Pet 209s almost exclusively even though there are 2 other brands up.November 18 , 2011 : Just a quick update . The feeders are down , the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well . After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best . I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule . No leaks . No broken roosts . Nothing negative . My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside . I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well . Ca n't wait for springtime and their arrival.In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet . We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back . With all factors the same , i.e. , sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why . They will not tell me . When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there . I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food . When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food . When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less . Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones . The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip . If simple , hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care . We use 1 cup sugar to 4 cups boiled water cooled to room temperature . The hummers are absolutely delightful and thank you Perky-Pet for the 209s .	1
I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older Perky Pet , 4 flower models . The old 4 flower model has a design flaw which sometimes led to dripping and also attracted ants and wasps . The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well . It is over-sized for our needs , so I just fill it with less food . Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint , it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder . A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers , fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top . It works great , the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days ! I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it was n't a problem for me . I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf , with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken , as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent , highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010 , Just bought my 3rd ...	1
It 's spring and time to bring out the hummingbird feeder . This is one of the most popular models and there are lots of reasons . It 's a simple design , has six feeding stations , has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces ! I 've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder ( wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind ) . Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are , the more you 'll have to refill the syrup . Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar ' is good stuff , but seriously , a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick . Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.To enhance your hummingbird traffic , supplement it with plants that look great . The following are some of my favorites for various reasons : Butterfly Bush - comes in blue , ruby , pink and purple and attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.Bottlebrush - small evergreen tree or shrub . Attracts hummingbirds , but can be messy with its flowers.Fuchsia - comes in bright red or purplish color and is great to hang next to your feeder and attracts hummingbirds.Morning Glory ( vine ) - multi-color attracts hummingbirds and grows quickly.Flowering red Currant - colorful background shrub that attracts hummingbirds , as well.Note that all these plants grow well in California , so check your local nursery for other suggestions .	1
Purchased these replacement yellow bee guards ( which differ in shape from the image on the Amazon site & # 8211 ; the guards now have a semi-globe shape ) , because I have the careless habit to walk out of the house and walk across the lawn , with a newly cleaned and filled hummingbird feeder held upside down . On occasion , after a forgetful moment , I re-install the freshly cleaned bee guards before I reach the hummingbird location . Once in a while , the bee guards have dropped out ( and customarily I located them again . ) The last time I didn & # 8217 ; t. Long story , irrelevant to the product review , I just realize . Be it as it may , I have no issues with the bee guards , nor ( more importantly ) do the hummingbirds . This past season , the guards functioned flawlessly , to the delight of our hummingbird population ( and frustration of the yellow-jackets . ) The only time ( no joke ) the bee guards didn & # 8217 ; t & # 8216 ; make it & # 8217 ; , was when a black bear roamed the property and totally demolished all of our hummingbird feeders ( no joke & # 8230 ; ) I don & # 8217 ; t expect Perky-Pet to take that into consideration ( sarcasm . )	1
These guards look like they would work well to deter bees . However they do not fit most of our feeders .	1
Tthese little gems are O.K . and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar ; however , there is just no humane way to rid one 's yard of bees . Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay . Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar . Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise . When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well .	1
For the appropriate hummingbird feeder ( s ) , these little guards are a & # 34 ; must have & # 34 ; if you are going to keeps bees and other insects from seriously messing up your feeders .	1
My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition . Excellent packaging ! Quality of Gauge was evident -- solid brass fittings , clear 0-200 lb . increments and metric scale ( atmospheres ) .A special Flat Rubber Washer ( included ) prevents leaks and helps keep water out of the housing . BE SURE the flat rubber washer is in place and fitting is tight to the spigot or manifold before water is turned on ! ! Do n't dare lose that Flat Washer , 'cause a regular Hose Washer wo n't work ! ! IF you have installed the Flat Washer and tightened the Fitting properly before turning on the water -- and you see water inside the gauge , turn it off and SEND IT BACK as defective . Amazon 's Returns Policy is the best in the on-line retail business , so it 's a hassle-free deal to get an exchange or refund.Good Luck ! !	1
This pressure gauge was almost half the price the one from home depot , but so much nicer - solid construction and does not leak . Seems to be accurate too .	1
This is a great little item to have when traveling from place to place . I have a regulator on my hose but it is nice to know what the water pressure is in cases where I had to take my regulator off to service it . Gives one a little peace of mind so you do n't worry about blowing your lines .	1
Attaches to any regular outside spicket or your washing machine line . Seems to read ok , but I 'm not 100 % sure because I do not have anything to compare it too . I think it would be beneficial to have a professional with professional tools measure the pressure as well to ensure the most accurate reading.The one negative I have is that the gauge fills up with water under the glass . I 'm not sure if mine is defective or if they are all that way , but I would think the water should not seep in like that .	1
If you are going to install a sprinkler system than you will need to know your PSI . This does a great job at letting me know where I stand . Now I can plan out my system .	1
This was purchased to measure my water pressure so that I know what the psi in order to install a back yard irrigation system . This gave me an idea on what to spec out during the purchasing of sprinkler equipment . The gauge is made of metal and can be screwed into your garden bib or faucet .	1
I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price . This Amazon item sells various remnants ( i.e . left-overs from longer hoses ) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo . I am attaching a photo ( under customer photos ) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose . It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store . It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches . The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings . The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo . However , after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall , I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review	1
Hose remnants at the local big hardware stores are insanely priced.Not so with this unit ! Great price and solid quality !	1
This is a very well made product and is a good length for connecting portable hose reels to the spigot . I will buy this product again when needed .	1
I purchased three of these via Amazon ( free delivery ) for $ 8 each and back for more . Great value ! I use them in combination with a 4 way connector set and adjustable sprinklers to water each of my raised garden beds with just one quick turn of the hose . Not only are they a much better quality than the sets supposedly created to do the same thing but the price is competitive too . Just the right size to daisy chain sprinklers and reduces the time required to tend the garden ... perfect for raised garden beds where regular sprinkler system might be over-kill.UPDATE - I noticed many people complaining over quality ... for the record I received the Black hose remnants as pictured . From the sound of it , there are various colors and quality issues . The black ones are very good quality with brass fittings .	1
Our 50-foot Gilmour hose was just slightly too short to reach the garden , so I picked up this `` remnant '' for those additional couple of feet - it works like a charm . Pretty good price . Not the highest quality hose out there ( thin , rubbery and could kink ) , but is perfect for my use and great VALUE . The one I got was just like the picture - black in color .	1
For a reasonable price these remnants proved fine for extending one pesky hose that was just a little bit too short .	1
This is a short piece of hose . It may not be the colour shown , so do n't buy it if you 're using it for decorative purposes . If you want it to function , it will.Yes , it has a plastic washer instead of rubber . If you would happen to have a leaking problem , just add some teflon tape ( which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure ) - it only costs a few cents a roll.As this is the cheapest such item to serve its purpose , it gets my recommendation . [ Mine is red and green , apparently for Christmas ] .	1
I bought this to relocate my hose reel in the backyard , and it has proven to be a decent buy . I have had no issues with leaking , and that 's all that I can really ask for here .	1
Use these to hook up various pvc connections in my garder watering system . Great length and price on these remnant hoses .	1
This was a recommended addition to my purchase of the `` Frigidaire FAD704DWD Energy Star 70-pint Dehumidifier '' . I use a gravity drain to a French Drain in the basement . The dehumidifier is about 10 ' from a hole into the drain and this hose did the job nicely . It comes rolled up and I had to run hot water thru it and then lay it out on the blacktop driveway in the hot sun to get it to lay straight .	1
I used this in the shower because it is a tough brush for skin , but do n't use it on sensitive areas because it is a strong wire which can damage the pores of vital areas if you know what I mean .	1

Absolutely the best brush I 've used . The brush head does n't go flat like others I 've used and it does a great job at keeping my Weber clean .	1
As grill brushes go , this is pretty nice . The extra-long handle is great for doing a burn-off cleaning , and the metal clip is perfect for cleaning off the cast-iron grills available on the Genesis.Amazon 's price is also 50 % less than every store I 've seen this at ( Sears , True Value , etc . ) , so I may pick up a couple more as spares .	1
I 've had the same brush for 4 years now . This brush is great . The wooden handle is sturdy , does n't heat up , and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it 's hot ( how I usually do it ) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head , you end up putting the brush at an angle ( since you ca n't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18 '' handle ) which means only the bristles at the very front get used . My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new . If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said , it 's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles .	1
Before , when I went to buy a new brush I would always get the cheapies ; I thought they were all the same , except some came in plastic while others came in wood or aluminum . I was wrong . You do get what you pay for when buying a grill brush , so buy this one ! The bristles are stiff enough to clean up all the grit , yet soft enough to not damage your grate . The brush feels nice and sturdy , it feels well built . Also , this brush has a handy scraper on the end which is extremely handy with the really tough crusties ( on your GRILL silly ) .	1
Bought this specifically for tailgaiting and it was perfect . We made sliders then made hot dogs and it cooked very well . Nothing but the best from weber !	1
I bought this grill primarily for when we go camping . This grills is ultraportable and it 's a Weber so it will last.priced right with free shipping is a winner in my book !	1
There is plenty of grill space to hamburgers , hotdogs , chicken , steaks or shrimp kabobs . Easy to regulate the heat using the vents . Love that the lid can hang on the grill to block the wind or just rest there while flipping your food ... .frees both hands !	1
We love charcoal , we just do ! This little grill is good for our camper and the bottom feet fold up to hold the top on while in transit . I love Weber , and this is a winner .	1
Bought it for camping and it is perfect . The legs hold the lid down for transport . And it has Weber quality construction . Love it .	1
For years , I 've been using a larger 22 '' weber grill , but when I moved recently I decided to get one a bit smaller to conserve charcoal . After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews , I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver . It is absolutely unbeatable , and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye ! While it does n't have an adjustable-height grilling surface , it 's quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you 're looking for . I 've been able to sear fish , or slow-cook buffalo wings , just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement . I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal , not briquettes , and both work equally well in this grill . Cleaning is a breeze , and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago , has n't even come close to needing it.As far as build quality goes , I really like the solid feel of the grill overall , but the legs could stand to be a bit sturdier . They are n't as weak as some reviewers have said , but it certainly is the weakest point of the grill as a whole . The plastic handle has never gotten too hot to handle , not as some reviewers said . The diameter of the grill could stand to be about 1/4 '' larger , to keep it from wiggling around so much when you 're brushing it . The vents constructions seems fantasic , they are easy to open and close , yet stay put when you need them to . Having easy access to both top and bottom vents allows for lots of experimentation with cooking temperatures . I love this grill to death , and I point out that fact to my fiance every time i use it ( `` see , i told you this thing is friggin ' awesome ! '' ) . Even when I buy myself a much larger charcoal grill in the near future , I will still use this grill every time I 'm only cooking for 1 or 2 people .	1
In my opinion and as well as thousands of other Weber owners , this is a great product . I have had 3 or 4 of these little units that I just leave behind and have never had a problem with one .	1
Probably the best grill for this price range ! Got one for my parents and compares well with my Weber 18 '' for grilling ! My only nit pick are the legs ! You may have to tighten them down from time to time to keep the wobble out ! But , back to grilling ! This is one nice little unit , burgers and steaks cook up quite nicely ! The secret is knowing how to use the upper and lower vents for heat and smoke adjustments ! Once you have that down , you can whip up some serious munch with this puppy ! Have done some excellent k-bob 's and burgers and steaks have come out just as nicely ! Have used Webers hickory chips for smoked meats and the flavor was delicious ! After each use , clean out ashes and you will have consistant bbq ! Put a piece of aluminum foil in the ash pan to catch the ashes ! Wrap it up and dispose of neatly . To help season the upper and lower grills and get rid of that metal taste and smell , I placed the grills in my oven ! Preheated to 325 degs . and baked for about an hour ! House stunk like hot steel for awhile , but no metal taste , the first time I used this grill !	1
The grill appears to be of good quality but the assembly instructions do n't match the parts that were shipped . The instructions show how to attach the air vent which comes attached with a rivet from the factory . There are more parts than are needed . You can assemble it ! but you will be confused . End product is satisfactory . Why do they call it the Smokey Joe Silver when it is black ? Poor choice of names .	1
Ive had this same grill for about 8 years now and its as nice now as the day I got it . Its big enough to cook pretty much whatever you need to cook on it , of course if you have a lot to cook it may take a little longer . Ive always had everything cook very evenly with more than sufficient burn time with coals . This grill is also small enough that you can take it with you for camping or going on your boat for a bbq on the beach ( I just use a bungy cord to secure the lid ) . If I need to rid of the coals I just put water on them turn the grill upside down and cover the coals in dirt , if the grill is still hot ill throw some more water on it then wipe it down and off we go..This grill isnt heavy so you can easily dump out the ashes in your trash can or where ever with minimal effort . Very great grill for the price and perfect for pretty much anyone !	1
I bought my first Smokey Joe in 1992 . I am finally replacing him ... not because he wore out , but because I tore him apart to use the pieces for something very important . ( It 's a long story ... Smokey Joe was all I had or I would have been outside all night in my car ) . Anyway , I am now replacing my first SJ with another . I 'm quite certain he will be chillin ' and grillin ' with me for the rest of my life .	1
The Weber Smokey Joe is a great portable grill as far as cooking quality is concerned but there are a few issues.First the good . You get a decent size grill area for an ultra-portable grill . It measures at 14 1/2 inches in diameter . Sure you probably ca n't do much with this grill if you are cooking indirect , but that 's not what this grill is meant for . The grill cooks much like it 's larger cousin - the Weber One-Touch . The porcelain enamel coating helps prevent rust . There 's a vent damper on the bottom of the grill ( as well as the top ) so it 's quite easy to control your temperature , much better then any other portable grill I 've owned anyways . The ash-catcher works well enough to keep hot pieces of ember from falling to the ground.As I mentioned before , there are a few caveats . My main complaint is that this grill has no lid-lock . This makes transportation a bit cumbersome , especially for a grill that is meant to be portable . You have to buy the Gold or Platinum version to get this functionality . I believe all portable grills should be easy to transport . I use a couple bungee cords to lock my lid down during transportation . Another small issue I had with mine is that one of the legs is a bit shorter then the other two , so my grill does n't sit as evenly as it should . This is n't a big deal because Weber has great customer service , it 's not that big of a deal anyways , it 's just a little off . Finally the top grate does n't fit very tightly so it wobbles around a bit - again a small issue . One other thing I should mention is that even though it has an ash catcher , it does n't have any sort of One-Touch type of system , so you have to dump it to clean it ( the vent damper does n't quite do it ) . This is n't an issue at all for me because it 's very light and easy to clean anyways but I thought I would mention that for those that might be curious.All in all this is a great portable grill . For my wife and I this is a great grill to use even when we are n't going anywhere because it needs so little charcoal . Cooking on this grill definitely feels like I 'm grilling on a baby version of my One-Touch . There are a few issues that keep this grill from getting a perfect score , but do n't let these small issues keep you from buying this great grill . Personally I believe it 's worth the $ 5.00 to go ahead and upgrade to the Gold so you can have the lid-lock , but it 's not essential , like I said before a couple bungee cords do the trick if you need that functionality . Happy grilling !	1
I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills & # 8230 ; and that & # 8217 ; s not quite true . This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill & # 8230 ; there & # 8217 ; s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle . The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around & # 8230 ; once lit this unit isn & # 8217 ; t going anywhere . Also , there & # 8217 ; s no place to put the lid once it & # 8217 ; s removed & # 8230 ; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground . Other than that & # 8230 ; it & # 8217 ; s a perfect grill for the two of us , it & # 8217 ; s easy to assemble , it & # 8217 ; s built rugged and it & # 8217 ; s easily worth 5-stars . I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it can not be moved with the handle & # 8230 ; when it & # 8217 ; s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you & # 8217 ; re good to go .	1
Hurricane Irene was on its way and our gas grill was DOA . Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime , because I did n't think to order a grill until a few days before the storm ; it arrived on Friday . We lost power early Sunday morning and did not get it back until this Saturday . There are only three of us , so this was just the right size for us -- you can fit three to four burgers on the grill at a time . It was simple to put together and very easy to use -- just roll 4 or 5 sheets of newspaper loosely , place them in the bottom of the kettle , put in about 30 briquets in a pyramid shape , light the papers and the charcoal is ready to use in about 20 minutes . Spread the charcoal out evenly and place the grill in place and you are ready to go . There 's an instruction booklet included . It was really a lifesaver this week and will be used regularly from now on . It 's easily portable for camping trips , too .	1
You can tell these are quality grills ; otherwise Weber would n't give these a 10 year warranty . My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I 'd purchase another . The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle . I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it . I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling . This is the perfect size for 1-3 people .	1
Okay , I 'm an addict and this is actually my fourth Weber grill ... I buy one every four to five years , use it often , treat it poorly , and when it starts to show signs of age , I simply spring for a new one . Until I discovered the Weber , I seldom even got a year out of my grills - so this is quite an improvement for me . The quality of the product , and the results I get , are topnotch , and today , I would n't consider any other brand ( except maybe a built-in Hastings - but that 's another animal altogether ) .I go back and forth between the 22.5 inch and the 26 inch version . The 26 is more expensive , but it offers quite a bit more cooking area . It also uses quite a bit more charcoal , and to my eyes , it does n't heat quite as evenly . Instead , I 've settled on the 22.5 , and on those relatively rare occasions when I need more grilling area , I just run a second grill.One thing I especially like is that Weber is so popular , you can get replacement parts just about anywhere . It 's nice to know that if I open the grill in the Springtime and the grates are all rusty , I can zip over to the local hardware store and probably find an exact replacement.This time I went for the blue version , but otherwise it 's the same Weber I 've come to love . Easy to clean , rugged - and it cooks as well as anything out there . I 'm not a fan of gas grills ... they simply do n't seem to get hot enough for certain uses . But with the Weber and some quality charcoal and you 're all set , no matter what 's on the menu.Only very small complaint is that I 've had some problems with the paint peeling off under the top cover . In the past , once I noticed this happening , I simply scrubbed all the loose paint off with a wire brush ... curious to see if this one has the same problem.Really recommended !	1
I 'm not even sure where to start ! I 've wanted to add a charcoal grill to my outdoor cooking fleet for many years just for those few times that I 'd like to cook more naturally . I 've used this one 2 times so far and ca n't believe I 've waited this long . I think it 's saved me over $ 1000 I was going to spend to replace my 10 yr old gas grill.This grill and a couple Weber accessories make charcoal grilling a breeze ! I have n't grilled with charcoal in years and obviously I had cheap junk for grills in the past.The quality of the grill is great , but I expected that . I can see it lasting years and years as many others have attested to . I 'll easily use it even during the week when I do n't have the time I thought it would take and thought gas was easier for . The first use and trying to get used to charcoal again was almost a failure because I almost choked the heat down keeping the vents closed . When I realized that the steaks slowed down cooking and the kettle top got wet from condensation it hit me that I had the vents closed thus the fire could n't breath . All I had to do was open the vents and 'viola , in no time the heat was back up and going strong with no other help from me , just air.Yesterday I outdid myself with ribs . Although I did cook them a little to high , they were the best I 've ever done both falling off the bone and the best flavor I 've ever gotten . I was using Mesquite chips as well but I 've done that on a gas grill and cooked twice as long and did n't get near the same results . It 's amazing how the kettle makes all the difference in the world keeping the charcoal hot and lasting a long time . I 'm amazed ! Clean up is much easier than I expected . The ash catcher is awesome , even in high gusty winds . Access though the grill for adding fuel makes adding briquettes and wood a breeze.Assembly was easy and took less than 20 minutes taking my time.The only con I can come up with was that on the top handle , it came out of the undamaged box with a chip of the porcelain coming off as if it had been hit . It 's small and by the handle and not exposing the metal so it 's not a functional problem but with the box arriving in perfect condition , it 's obvious it happened before being packed . However , I 'd be surprised if anyone could find it.All I can say is that I 'm sold ! ! Everything Weber that I 've bought , from the grill to the accessories , have been top notch . Charcoal grilling is now a breeze and so much better than gas . The old saying is absolutely true ; having the right tools make all the difference in the world . The Weber Kettle is absolutely the right tool ! ! Being made in the USA is the cherry on top ! To address some of the complaints in the lesser ratings : The handles do n't get hot . As hot as mine has been , the handles are easy to hold with bare hands , although I tend to use a mitt around a grill . The new handles should last in any weather condition and much longer than wood as well.It would be nice to have a temp gauge but that 's not hard to add if you really need one . I can see the benefit but it 's limited.The Kettle is not unstable if it 's put together right . If it falls apart after assembling , the legs are n't being secured fully as they should be , which is to tap them all the way in . Rolling it is n't a problem but like with most anything , you have to be careful . Depending on which way you roll it , one might be able to knock it over if not careful , but I 've not found that to be easy to do . Standing , it 's as stable as can be . Again , if it 's wobbly or falls apart as one has claimed , the legs were not assembled properly.The lid DOES have a hook to hang on the side of the kettle ; it 's on the underside of the top near the vent . It hangs nicely on the side of the kettle .	1
We have a similar model One Touch Premium home ( Germany ) and the quality of Weber pays off . I brought the old chinese bbq to trash today ; - ) .The Weber is very solid build and comes ready to go with drop pans and charcoal holders ( wires ) . Bought a chimney from Weber since the reviews were so good . Tried direct and indirect , keep on training.Will not to back to chinese quality again.Since we live in Northern Germany usage of this bbq is limited to summer time , completed with a Q200 grill .	1
Our gas grill finally rusted out after 15 years . I was ready to spend $ 700 on the 320 but started asking myself why ? Grilling outside is for leisure , take your time , relax and enjoy the flavor . So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years ! This grill is so easy to use . I did n't get the chimney starter , I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine . I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes . The ash collector is fantastic , the ashes do n't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes . I got blue , it really looks great . The little hook inside the lid makes it easy to set it aside so you have both hands.This is going to be a great summer - now if we could just get some sun here in the NW !	1
Order this blue grill a week ago and got a defect with 2 big black dent on the side on the cover exposing the inside metal . I was a little disappointed . Try to contact Amazon customer service on the web and was amazed that they have a `` please call me '' service . I just typed in my phone number and they call me right away . The return for a replacement is painless and they order a new one for me right away . All I need to do is put the damaged grill in the original box , re-tape it , leave it outside my front door . UPS was here the next day , pick up the box and return to Amazon . That was really easy.I finally receive my new blue grill today . It is perfect and only took me 10 minutes to assemble it . The ash tray needs a little adjustment with a plier and now it is working perfectly . I have ordered a work table and putting it in is a snap . I also got the smokenator and it fit perfectly inside the grill . Try the cover and it fit perfectly and no gap in between with everything in place . I am a happy camper and ready to do some bbq this weekend . The blue color looks really nice in my backyard for an extra $ 10.So do not get despair if you get a defect , just keep returning and you will eventually get a perfect one . It worth the wait.I am glad that I only need to return it one time . On my reasons of return , I mention this grill is defective and should not put back on the shelve and send to other customers . I also contact Weber and let them know about this so they can improve their product quality control in the future before boxing their products and send to the distributor.Hope this help and good luck .	1
We ordered this for the FIRST time on February 5 , 2010 . My husband was so excited and rushed out to buy charcoal , cleaning brushes , etc . When we got it and he opened the box we discovered one of the handles was bent , and there was a large section that had no protective paint over it , making us fear it would rust prematurely . Needless to say we were disappointed . He boxed it up and I called Amazon , and they were great ! They immediately sent us a return packaging slip , and placed a new order ( at upgraded two day shipping no less ) for us . So , once we got all that straightened out and got the second one ( which looked great by the way ) we unpacked it and looked forward to making the chicken we had prepared.My husband put it together and brought it over to me and I must say , the blue looks a heck of a lot cooler than the basic black ! This is the upgraded model with the reservoir for ashes , and while I do n't do a lot of grilling , my husband really appreciated this aspect of the grill.It was easy to put together , and Weber has a wonderful reputation when it comes to grill products . The chicken we cooked on it came out wonderfully , though we have had a gas grill for the past few years , so the extra time a charcoal grill takes will take some time to get used to.All in all well worth the money.//Update March 2013 : Wow . Has it already been over 3 years ? I guess it has . This grill is still going strong . We clean it regularly , and keep it covered with one of the standard Weber grill covers . It has no rust and still cooks some great food . The ash catch is an absolute must have with the charcoal grills . Still very pleased with this purchase . Especially seeing as we 've had other grills fall apart in little over a year .	1
I love BBQ . For convenience I have often used a gas grill , but really do love the taste of meat cooked over charcoal ( PAH and NCA risks notwithstanding ) . I have often cooked turkey breasts for Thanksgiving , and particularly love the smokey flavor that comes with it ! Alongside baked potatoes and fresh veggies ( extra nice on the grill ) , I have a special meal that is actually healthy.So when my last gas grill bit the dust , we went back to the old fashioned way of cooking ! Real charcoal , real delicious smell , real delicious flavor ! I suggest that you consider using theWeber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter , so that you can have the purest taste without any chemical oders.A funny thing happened when a dear friend came by to visit ... Her son was entranced by the fact that we did n't have any fuel for our BBQ . Times change , but old fashioned flavor does n't . This grill made the move with us recently and now sits on our new deck waiting for spring , or at least a nice sunny day !	1
Great Product ! Makes it fun and easy to Bar-B-Que.I have a Weber Gas Grill and use it all the time . However when I want that real charcoal flavor nothing beats this Weber Grill . The ashes just fall into the bottom for easy removal.A great product and reasonably priced .	1
This is my second Weber ... the first lasting me about 7 years . We like charcoal ( instead of gas ) and the Weber is a wonderful all-around grill .	1
When it came time for us to get a new charcoal grill I searched every site and checked out dozens of different grills , some costing many hundreds of dollars , all promising some advantage.Some units were really interesting , and not too expensive , but upon close inspection many of these proved to be tinny and cheaply made . The very expensive systems were very nice , but did not offer rotisseries and other useful accessories and were just too expensive for us anyway.So , we ended up with another Weber , the Gold Model . In the many years since our last Weber , there have been a lot of improvements that kept it attractive . The ash catcher really does make cleanup much easier and the vent system is more functional . The grill itself has the new flip-up hatches that allow you to add more coals and move them around without having to lift up the grill . I did that all the time with the old grill.The optional little bent-wire style of charcoal retainers do help to keep the coals out to the side when you want to use a drip pan in the center.Others have recommended the chimney style charcoal start for ecological reasons . It is also just plain faster to use as well , and it is made of heavy gauge metal that is both attractive and long-lasting.I love the optional rotisserie ( see those reviews ) and it comes with an extension ring that is also useful for other cooking options.We got the green colored kettle and it looks very nice on the patio . The general design and those odd white-wall tires give it a kind of vintage look.This is a well-made and very functional grill with all sorts of interesting available accessories that really work well . There is a reason for the popularity of the Weber . I looked , I bought . Hard to beat ... ... ... ... ... .Update 7/2012 . Still good , used daily all summer and even in the rain under my porch cover . Something I came up with that could be interesting to the more dedicated user . I essentially bought a downed oak tree and have been splitting it for firewood for next winter . Had a lot of small , crooked , knotty , twisted pieces that could n't easily be split . I cut them up into 1 '' cubes on a band saw , hoping to use them as briquettes in the Weber . A newspaper sprinkled with cooking oil got them started in the Weber chimney starter quite quickly . The secret is to be a bit patient so that they stop flaming and turn to glowing coals . And then you have a genuine oak BBQ , just like on a ranch . Very good , but a lot of work and dangerous enough even on a band saw . And it messes up the blade and rollers . The other more accessible method would be to simply start an oak campfire in the Weber , using regular old pieces of oak like you would in a fireplace . It would take some time to burn down to coals , but even more of an excuse to drink too much and then burn the food because ... .well , everyone has done this . Right ? Anyway , flaming oak imparts a kind of bitter taste while glowing oak coals make it delicious . I do this research for you.__________________________Update 2 , on cooking an expensive steak . This works and requires no skill . I went out and bought the most expensive steak ever , an organic , grass fed , free range whatever ribeye at a boutique market and the attractive butcher girl probably had her thumb on the digital scale besides . I about died when I saw the price . Hmmm , ca n't afford to cook this any way but perfectly.I once saw a YouTube video on how to properly cook a steak using high heat and this is my BBQ grill interpretation of that.Use the coal retainers to block off a section of the lower grill and fill up that smaller portion with lots of hot coals . It can not be too hot in this case.Put on the cooking grill and let the previous session 's grease flame off , which of course also heats it up hotly and is somewhat entertaining and makes you feel guilty about what you are eating ... Put on the steak . Having those long tongs helps a lot . You can rub it with olive oil if you want , but it is unclear to me if that is necessary and it causes more flame-ups . No BBQ sauce though . Lid off ! Deal with the flame-ups by maneuvering the steak around . Some people use a water spray . This is hands-on , attentive work.Stand by . It will cook fast . Have your other food well under way . Within minutes the down side will have that crust of goodness , short of burnt of course . Turn it over and do the other side . When that side is seared , remove the steak and insert a digital cooking thermometer , taking care to place it in the very center , from the side ( not stabbed in from the top ) . I use a Polder and the line from the sensor to the display seems to hold up in high heat , but do n't string it out over the coals . Run it out the back . Set the alarm for 130.Put the steak back over the un-coaled area . The effect now is that this is a very hot oven , not a grill . Put on the lid , make sure all vents are open . Watch the temp rise , amazingly fast so do n't wander off.Remove the steak , with tongs , to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil , resting it as they say on cooking shows . By the time everything else is served up , maybe 10 minutes or so , it should be ready to serve.This gives you a steak that looks exactly like the ones in advertisements , medium rare with a great crust . You can throw it back on and in a couple of minutes the temp and doneness will go up . There is no shame in putting food back on the fire , but there is shame in over-cooking it ! If you paid the big bucks for your meat , burning it will make you cry.BTW , this works for other meat like thick cut pork chops ( thick ones are easier to cook properly ) . Use the same method , but run the temp up to 140-145 ( 145 being the new govt standard , and in fact it is the standard for all meat other than poultry . If you were brought up on thin , over-cooked pork chops ( we all were ) you have a revelation coming . Chicken parts do n't require the high heat , but a quick sear and off the the oven part works very well for them.It is suggested that the steak be served with salt and pepper , applied after it is cooked as it may be a bad idea to subject the salt and pepper to high heat . The more expensive the meat , the less you should put on it . Cooks always suggest kosher salt and it is indeed very good for this , and ground pepper is better as well . I really think BBQ sauce is too much for expensive beef , but if you want to fancy it up , slowly heat up some butter and garlic and let it meld together . Strain it and serve it on the side , or simply pour it on . What the heck , you have already gone well over the fat grams or whatever for the month anyway ... If you have to cook more than maybe 3 or 4 large steaks , you could fill the entire bowl with coals and then finalize them in the kitchen oven set very high , like 450 , and with the temp probe stuck in the most representative steak . This gives you 90 % of the grilling experience and taste .	1
I have used a number of different charcoal grills , and the Weber Gold is the best . Unless you want to spend twice the price and buy the Weber Performer , which is a Weber Gold with gas ignition , table , and a place to store charcoal . Not sure why you would want to store charcoal outside where it can absorb moisture , but that is another story.First off the Weber is made with a thicker steel , so it retains the heat better than the cheaper , lighter , offshore made products . The grill is heavier , so you can get more than one season out of it . The ash catcher is great . Its a must have feature . Other units get ashes all over my deck , which is unacceptable , and a fire hazard on windy days.My Weber Gold is about 10 years old . I replaced the cooking grate once . It still functions perfectly . It lives outside and only has one tiny spot of rust , where the cover got hit with a rock and it chipped the paint . One day I will get around to sanding and painting that spot so it lasts another 10 years . The aluminum portions of the grill are a little weathered , but still function perfectly . I guess if I really wanted to I could polish them up , but a little oxidation does not bother me.The only downside I can even think about is the top handle . It is plastic , not wood . Sometimes it gets too hot to handle so I have to use a potholder if I am cooking at a very high temperature . Other than that , it is the best charcoal grill on the planet.Sure you can buy one cheaper , but they will not last . Buy a Weber and you will leave it to your children when you die . And they will get many years of use out of it too !	1
This grill works great . I love the one touch ash disposal feature . Have purchased the Rotisserie attachment also , and I LOVE what these two peices of equipment do to my Roasting Chicken ! ! It will Rotisserie a small Turkey also , leaving it so jucy and tender . Will be using this for many years to come .	1
I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year . I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time , finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision . Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me . We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time , we cooked a lot of meat , pepper , corn and etc , it was awesome . We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it , it 's gon na get a lot more use this summer .	1
You can grill/ bbq/ smoke just about anything shy of a half a large animal on this . Im glad I went with the 22.5 . Will move up to the 26 later when needed . There are so many things you can do with this when adding other attachments ( smokenator , rotisserie , pizza oven , iron grates , wok , skillet , the list goes on ) .	1
This BBQ grill lives up to everything written about it and the quality is quite good . The new feature of detachable ash catcher is definitely worth having . This grill cooks burgers and steaks to perfection , once you get accustomed to how to arrange the live coals ( using more or less heat , etc ) . I would recommend this grill for anyone wanting an excellent charcoal grill .	1
Setup was easy on this grill after I realized that I will have to scrape the tabs of the ash catcher ring down the small leg posts . At first I did not like the idea of scraping my nice new grill , which is why I temporarily stumbled on the instructions . They pop in nicely once you get past this . The 3rd leg kind of twirls on which is quite obvious once you start fiddling with it but the instructions have no words so the pictures are not as self-explaintory as I would have hoped in these 2 areas.My only complaints on this grill are the legs and the handle . The legs were wobbly and not as secure as I would have liked them and they were installed all the way to the base of the grill ( as the picture showed ) some nuts and bolts would have went far in this area.The handle gets to hot to handle with bare hands . especially when doing large meats like roasts or whole chickens . Wood would have fixed this problem . I wrapped mine with some small rope ( not string ) and it helped a little.All said and done it 's a great grill . Get it.FYI-The Weber 87886 Chimney Starter is incredible and it 's only 12 bucks . Get that too.Weber 87886 Chimney Starter	1
This grill is wonderful ! It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food . The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor . The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks . Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble . We use it almost every night . This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it . We expect to be using it for many years .	1
Easy to assemble , though I will admit that one of the wheels keeps popping off the side when i roll it around my patio . But then again , i rarely have to move the grill so it 's not like it 's a big deal . The grill is large and easy to clean and the thing that stands out most with this grill is the ash-catching compartment on the bottom . Plus my steaks taste way better using this thing compared to my previous grill which used propane	1
I purchased this grill , but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it . With the chimney starter , it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill , so you really have n't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and do n't forget to get the rotisserie attachment . You have n't had turkey for thanksgiving until you 've had a rotisserie turkey ! Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I 've ever owned .	1
I bought this for the simplicity of clean up . I wish the kettle had an adjustable coal grate to lower or make higher the direct heat . It takes a while to get it just right with the right amount coal . But overall great quality .	1
This is the best charcoal grill I have ever owned . I have cooked ribs at 225-250 and been able to control the fire easily . I used the 2-2-1 method on a rack of baby backs and never had to think about adding charcoal over 5 hours . By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes . The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak . I feel comfortable cooking on my wooden deck because of the ash pan . The only addition i would make is the Craycort cast iron grate .	1
This grill performed as advertized in the reviews here . Assembly is easy and takes less than a half hour . The cooking time is longer than other charcoal grills , but is more uniform because of the ceramic cauldron reflective characteristics . I also bought the stainless steel tools and the tool holder . The latter ships separately from another company and the shipping/handling is about twice as much as the tool holder .	1
That title was sarcasm , in case you missed it.When we bought a house almost fourteen years ago , I brought along a Weber Smokey Joe grill I had used when I was single . We used it for the first several months of our marriage as our only grill . Then we bought a Weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill for our new backyard . We have used it regularly ever since . It works for indirect cooking of roasts and chickens , it works for direct grilling burgers , chops and sausages , it works for roasting chiles and it works as a fire pit to burn hardwood logs to fuel my large offset firebox smoker . This grill has been out in the weather without a cover for 13 years or so and it has held up beyond reasonable expectations . Only within the past few months has the use , age and abuse begun to take a toll . There are several spots where the porcelain has worn away that are rusting through or already have rusted through . The wooden handles dry rotted away . The nuts holding the aluminum airflow disc adjusters at the bottom of the kettle rusted off . And I 'm still using it . I did a steak and some pork chops last night , using lump charcoal and pecan hardwood chunks I chopped up myself . They were delicious.I also have a gas grill that is convenient but does not even come close to giving the good taste you can get from charcoal and wood fuel . Trying to use a smoker box on a gas grill is futile for me . You ca n't adjust the airflow through a gas grill . The only adjustment is the level of the flame . I constantly find the wood chips either just burn up quickly without producing much smoke or they never heat up enough to start smoking at all . The gas grill does n't get much use at my house.I also use an offset firebox smoker . It 's great for doing large size pieces of meat or poultry or multiple pieces of smaller items . It does require frequent attention to keep the fire going and the temperature within the proper range . Honestly , the Weber grills can do the same or better job for smaller cuts of meat by cooking indirect . About the only time I use the smoker is when I have something too large for the Weber.It 's time retire the old Weber . I 've already put a One-Touch Gold on my Amazon wishlist . I think I 'll use the old grill as a planter . I ca n't imagine throwing it away after all these years .	1
We had a gas grill for years but opted to go back to a charcoal grill . This Weber grill made our decision easy . Outstanding medium size grill for the two of us grilling several items and works well for 4 or more depending on what you need to prepare on the grill . Suggest using the Weber Rapidfire Chiminey for starting your briquets ... it 's great and makes your job not only easier but the food taste better without the use of starter fluid . Great grill ... .great name behind it ! !	1
After our gas grill had to be retired , we decided to get a charcoal grill . Weber has a reputation for having a solid product that will last for many years , and I have no doubt that we 'll be using this for a long time . But the legs seem to be made out of somewhat cheaper material than what we had when I was younger . Think I 'll be getting the cover to protect it over the winter.This particular model does n't have the one-touch ash catcher and after using this a few times , I 'm kind of sorry we did n't go with that particular model.One person can put it together without help , athough it can be a struggle for a bit.Grilling ? Well that 's exactly like you 'd expect although I miss having a grated shelf to keep some items a little further from the charcoal . That just requires a difference in how you mound the briskets .	1
I wish I 'd bought one of these the day I first moved out on my own ! For years I got by with a ridiculously tiny hibachi -- one day I found myself living in the suburbs and somehow rationalized BUYING A REAL BARBECUE ! Due to my dyed-in-the-wool cheapness and extensive researching before buying , it was inevitable that I 'd end up with a Weber 22.5 '' Silver Kettle Grill ! YES the little tray on the bottom end is a pain in the neck . But I ca n't say it 's really ever bothered me ALL that much ! You 'll want to use a charcoal chimney to light your coals -- I used to build a little fire with newspaper and sticks but the charcoal chimney is the way to go , and one chimney will nicely fill the coal area on the Silver Kettle Grill . Do not ever use lighter fluid or fuel-soaked coals . But you already know that.While you 'll get the hang of burgers , hot dogs , steaks , chicken and bratwurst right away , make sure to investigate `` indirect grilling '' where you pile your coals on one side or the other ( or both ) and put an aluminum tray under whatever you 're grilling . Like a pork roast or a whole chicken . The 22.5 '' Silver Kettle Grill has AMPLE room for everything you 'd like to do . Including grilling a turkey ! Easy to do plus incredible flavor ! I recently acquired a `` slide-aside '' cradle for the lid which I like a lot , and a clip-on tool holder , which is really handy . We use the grill several times a week . I 've never found it lacking . There are a few techniques you 'll pick up to turn out just what you like , such as brining chicken or pork prior to cooking . You really do not have to spend more than this to get an excellent tool which you 'll use for years and years to come . Get this larger size , but do n't spend more on non-essentials . It 's a zen thing . In place of a statue of Buddha , we suburbanites have Weber Kettle Grills in our backyard . Grilling harkens back to caveman days , satisfying something very deep in every red-blooded American -- meat good . fire good . Weber good.Order the hinged lid grate for this size grill -- it 's a neat thing to have when you need it . And make sure to try grilled pizza dough -- it does n't ooze through the grate like you 'd think it would and the flavor is incredible.The perfect shape of the Weber Kettle Grill makes operation just about foolproof . Improvise an improved ash catcher underneath ( like a big metal bucket ! ) and you 're in business . GREAT product ! This is not a frivolous purchase , you NEED one of these !	1
So , I thought after fiddling with offset grills and barrel grills , it 's time to try a kettle grill after all the hoopla from the UPS driver delivering all my other toys . Well folks , it 's worth it . I had to get a covered grill that was n't as big as my car for the front porch , after all the hollering by neighbors who saw the smoke billowing from my hibachi . After all the charcoal experimenting with my barrel grill and its cousins and a Bodum Fyrkat , I figured , what 's new ? Well , a whole lot . While related to the Bodum , the Weber is a whole lot more versatile , and can , if you wish create a range of flavors and textures . While the one-touch system was touted as a handy cleaning device , where it really excells is as a controllable oxygen source . Couple that nicety with movement of the 4-hole vent in the lid and you control both the intensity of the heated charcoals with directionality . When you 're using indirect heat , the control of the temps lay with the oxygen adjustment , whilst the direction of the heat can determine the moistness as well as the degree of charring of the food . The heavy steel as well as the brilliantly designed cooking grate that facilitates access to the coals make for a fun time at the cookery . The Weber is iconic ; it deserves that status .	1
My original Weber is 15 years old and still going strong . Replaced some of the inner parts due to age/exposure . No need for a protective cover , this grill is built to last . Got this one for a lake house . No need to change from the strong horse .	1
There are a lot of reviews on this already . It is definatley a 5 star review . I have had quite a few different weber products over the years , and this is just one more . I love the one touch clean out on the bottom of the grill , that is also the vent cover . The old kettles had a bottom vent that was just like the vent on top . That little tab would get warmer than you want to touch with your bare fingers . The new one has a handle that does n't get too hot to handle . The vents open easily , and move around the ashes in the bottom , and push them out the vent holes.Just one little piece of advice . When you are installing the legs , pay attention to which leg goes where . The one that is different goes in the hole right under the handle . I hasve both seen and owned grills that have the wrong leg in the wrong hole , and that makes the handle on the side , intstead of the front . It is an easy fix , but easier to pay attention the first time .	1
I love this Weber One Touch Silver kettle . Seeing the kettles my relatives have , but made years earlier , i am pleased that years later , it still seems to be made with high quality steel , a good enamel and tight engineering . The handles have gone from wood to a resin , but they work well . Grilling or smoking , this unit has proven itself worth the money.I wrestled between buying the Silver or the Gold model , but what swayed me was that on Weber 's site , the Silver shows `` Made in USA '' while the Gold does not . The reviewers for the Gold , here on Amazon , state that the box says `` Assembled in USA '' , or something like that . The Weber site has no mention of any of it . I decided to avoid the issues that some with the Gold were reporting and I went with the Silver . It is very solid and I am glad I did .	1
I had a Weber Kettle grill 20 years ago . I had no clue what I was doing , but I still got great results . Open the vents , put on the dome , and a little while later I had great food . But I got tired of waiting for charcoal to heat up , and went on to propane . I never got good results with gas . After wasting way too many years destroying food on gas grills , I came home to charcoal and Weber . This time around I know what I 'm doing , and the Weber is giving me Fantastic results . The 22 1/2 kettle is a great all around cooker . It grills , sears , bakes and does a very good job of `` low and slow '' smoking . If you only have the room or desire for one cooker , get this one without hesitation . It wo n't smoke quite as good as a real smoker , but unless you 're a perfectionist , you 'll never know the differance . The 18 inch grill is a great cooker too , but because it 's smaller it 's harder to smoke on it . So if you have the room , get this model . The lid and bowls are built like a tank . I found the unit wiggles around where the legs attach , even though I assembled it correctly . The older ones do n't wiggle . But that 's progress . I do n't think it 's a problem though , just an observation . I was torn between 4-5 stars because of that . They have been building these forever , so assesories and replacement parts can be had easily.Built solid , mutliple uses , food tastes great , easy to use . Not much else to say .	1
I love this grill . This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap . The only tool you 'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on . In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on . I 've cooked whole chickens , cabbage , bread , and pizza using this method . The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you 're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking , use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate . That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate .	1
First the good . I love the looks of this grill . It is sleek , styling and iconic and I enjoy seeing it on my porch.- It is much more attractive than one of those monstrous gas grills.- It seals very tightly.- Its simple style allows you to cook many different meats in many different ways.- There are so many accessories available for it and they are easy to find.Now the bad . Besides the black metal kettle part , everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal . I would n't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic . Again , I would not buy a children 's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let 's face it . This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill . You are paying for quality and looks . I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply is n't a viable competitor right now . If there were other options it would not have fared so well . I feel like Weber has taken advantage of their good name and market share and is allowing their quality to suffer.Shockingly , I would buy it again .	1
Bought this small Weber for use by my wife and me since our kids are all grown up nowadays.Easy to assemble , Weber quality as expected . We also bought the cover and are pleased with both.Cooking surface is not large ; but , can easily accommodate three steaks and a couple of veggie skewers .	1
I 've had the 18.5 Weber kettle for about 5 years and have been very happy with it . However , anyone shopping for a grill should consider the full-size , 22.5 grill.We bought the 18.5 because our family is small and I figured this would be plenty big enough . What I did n't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking . The 18.5 just does n't have the space , even for a small family . If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people , the 18.5 will serve fine but you wo n't have much versatility.Now that I 've `` grown '' as a griller , I wish I had the One-touch Platinum . This model gives extra space , an ash catcher , temp gauge , sliding lid and 2 side tables . However , my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements . Kinda difficult to justify the new grill when the old one is still in great shape .	1
Ca n't beat Weber Grill 's for sturdy build and ease of use . Perfect for small get togethers or smaller households . Would recommend easy start charcoal or get a charcoal starter that weber sells and pour the coals in when ready . Charcoal grate is of a very heavy guage and should last for years as well as the cooking grill its self . Some nice accessories to go with this unit : , IE : Heavy Duty Grill cover , Tool Rack , Cutting Board , Bracket for holding lid to name a few . I really enjoy steaks and burgers on this weber ! One of the best grills I 've ever owned for a evenly grilled and tender sirloin steak ! Learning how to use upper and lower vents makes all the difference ! Using the direct and indirect methods I grilled/smoked a sirloin tip roast that came out superb with a nice even bark and the mouth watering taste of hickory smoke and a light coating of bbq sauce ! Going for ribs next ... After reading many reviews on Weber grills , some complain of the ashes clogging the lower vents ... .duh ... clean the thing out after each use ! Thats what the ash pan is for ... no brainer ! ! ! !	1
I got this in addition to my Weber Genesis Platinum Grill . I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak , Burgers , Chicken , BBQ Chicken , for a great authentic taste . It heats quickly ( Weber Chimney ) about 20 minutes . It is easy to assemble , very sturdy and quite stable . Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle . You should never move a hot grill of any kind . It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials . The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors . ( I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking ) . The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent , and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position . I did 2 zone cooking and all worked extremely well .	1
I love this grill . This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap . The only tool you 'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on .

The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you 're cooking.My only complaint about this is its size . Its great for direct cooking steaks , chops , etc . But to do some more long term smoking of ribs , whole chickens , its a little small because the coals get too close to the sides of the food and some parts might get scorched . If you do a lot of slow , indirect cooked foods , go for the 22 1/2 inch weber kettle grill .	1
After owning a couple of those flimsy & # 34 ; bargain & # 34 ; grills , I finally got serious and bought a Weber ! This 18-1/2-inc size is perfect for a few hamburgers or steaks . The construction is first-rate , and there is no wobbling or flexing when it is moved about . I suggest making your purchase complete by getting a Weber charcoal starter chimney ( go ahead and get the larger size ) .	1
What 's in the box ? Just the trapWarning : you need to check with local laws and ordinances with respect to trapping specific animals . My locale allows year round trapping and disposal . Bear in mind , some areas do not allow transfer of animals from one location to another to limit spread of disease.SetupDepending upon what you 're trying to catch , you place the appropriate bait distal to the lever in the compartment of trap . I am catching raccoons , and they enjoy , fish , crispy bacon , nuts and marshmallows . The trap is a little tricky to set up . Lift the metal gate and secure a small latch that connects to a slot in the door.I have a recommendation with regards to placement . Because the floor is open , I recommend placing this on a piece of cement or plywood . It will keep you from having to dig out a lot of dirt , which I have done.The trap is durable and will keep your critter secure.ConclusionI caught my first raccoon on the first night . Worked like a charm.Highly recommend .	1
easy to set up but they got the apple and did n't stick around to say thanks for the snack . maybe next time	1
I caught over 18 rabbits , 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use . The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals . The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap . If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience . It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort .	1
I caught five raccoons in six days of having the trap set . Sometimes the raccoon turns the trap over after he is trapped but it does n't open . The carrying handle and shield came off with the second raccoon . I used a needle-nose pliers to wrap the shield flange around the wires of the trap and now it stays on securely . I also used the pliers to tighten the wires that hold the carrying handle on . Subsonic .22 caliber bullets can humanely eliminate the raccoon without a lot of noise . Marshmallows make good bait . Something fishy will catch raccoons but it can also catch cats and opossums , which I am not trying to reduce .	1
I did not have to make any adjustments either to the trigger or trigger arm . Just be sure the cage is completely level and the trigger arm nor the door is rubbing up against anything to obstruct or slow down the releasing of the trap door.However , ground squirrels are clever little critters . Most times you come out and see the door sprung and the food gone is because they tried getting the food out the other end of the cage through the wire - and they can do that . I cut a piece of OSB to completely cover the other end of the outside of the cage and tied it on with wire . The first time I used heavy cardboard - they ripped it to shreds to get to the food . Then all you have to do is upend the cage - drop something covered with peanut butter in ( I use graham crackers ) - it will stick to the wire and OSB ( also slowing down the squirrel just enough to trip the pan ) . Use a little stick if you have to , to mash it to the wire and OSB . Another good bait are apple strips . These are made with apple peelers that have the little crank . The whole apple peel comes off in one strip . This also slows down the squirrel and the apple peel will cover part of the pan . Bigger items like this are more successful than small ones.It was more work taking the critters away and releasing them that catching them.This is a perfect size to catch ground squirrels - the size down is a bit small - this one has more room they have to cover to trip the pan - in other words they ca n't just dangle half their body in , grab the food and leave without getting near the pan .	1
Using peanut butter and marshmallows in a papercup as bait I have trapped and transported 4 out of a family of 5 raccoon away from my Koi pond . I take them 8 miles away and release them near a small river . Only one left is one of the teenagers , I 'll probably get them next week . If I had hired a & # 34 ; critter getter & # 34 ; to trap them , they would have killed them which I did n't want.Easy to set , easy to pick up without exposing yourself to the animal inside . I like the way it opens , I cover the trap with a towel so they ca n't see me and just pop the door up . The minute they see the opening , they are gone.If you are going to transport them remember that it is against the law in some areas . Also recommend that you put some wood underneath the cage in your car to protect your interior . Anything they can reach they will try to use to claw their way out .	1
I do catch , spay , release for cats . currently I use a low priced trap that has literally fallen apart as various spot welds have failed . this Havahart is simply better made . only time will tell if all the pieces stay together .	1
I had to look up the dimensions of this particular trap since the description lacks that information . It 's 32 '' x10 '' x12 '' Works well for our needs : Feral cat Trap , Spay , Release with the Humane Society	1
Over the summer , I was constantly noticing piled mulch in my beds and every time I would go to flatten it back out I would find a cat poop covered up ; not only a pain to clean up but also a health hazard too . After checking the security tapes I found it was a feral cat problem we had . I found this trap on Amazon and saw a good majority of the reviews were favorable and decided to give it a try . Setup out of the box was a little confusing at first but the kit is mostly assembled out of the box . The only parts you have to assemble are the pole from the step that triggers the door to a hook on the door and to secure the back of the cage closed . It was a bit of a challenge to get the pole from the step to the door to line up but it seemed so simple after getting it together.This trap is very durable . Solidly constructed , pre-assembly out of the box was a positive . The first night I set up the trap with a small paper plate of a little bit of wet cat food . I checked on the trap after a couple hours and had caught my first feral cat . I transferred it to a different cage to take to the shelter the next day and set the trap up again . All told over about a week I had caught nearly 8 feral cats , I could n't believe there were that many in my neighborhood . What is great about this trap is the assembly of the door , easy to open and release the animal should you be looking to relocate an animal such as opossum 's or groundhogs . The best thing you can do is to cover the trap with an old towel . Not only will it help protect you from clawing animals but I found that it helped to calm the animal and also kept the trapped animal from giving away what the trap really is to other animals.For the price , this is a really durable animal trap and I have been satisfied to own it . I 've even lent it to a few friends and they have told me they had great results capturing their troublesome creatures of the night . The best part is the unit can be easily broken down to store flat against the wall , and can pop back together quite quickly when you need it .	1
We needed a trap to catch a skunk raiding the chicken house . It worked as expected , although I did not enjoy having to get close to the skunk once caught . Not the fault of the trap though .	1
Had a possum . Put this out with some dog food and caught it in less than 3 hours . I had an animal guy come out , couldnt catch the possum and try and charge me $ 500 . Way easier , cheaper and faster	1
This works well , but be sure not to buy this for smaller rodents , such as squirrels or rats.They are too small and light to trip the mechanism that swings the door closed . I 've used this trap to catch large opossums and it 's the perfect size . The animal was not harmed and we were able to set it free without touching the little fella . Recommended .	1
We 've borrowed many traps over the years to catch , spay/neuter and release stray cats in our neighborhoodbefore finally buying two of this Havahart trap # 1079 which we found at Home Depot a couple years ago.After borrowing a variety of brands , one ca n't help but notice a big difference in quality from one brand to another.Many have thinner wire then Havahart , which is trickier to get the trigger rod set.Some may be painted ( like at Tractor Supply ) rather than galvanized for rust resistance like Havahart.Some have had a smaller hand guard , or worse ~ none.CONCLUSION ~ Havahart is an easy to use , excellent preforming , quality constructed , durable trap.With heavy gage galvanized wire and all smooth/ rounded edges . It 's a five star product.As if it could n't get any better ~ Havahart is made in America.Footnote : For convenience ~ three sizes of Havahart traps ~Small ~ Ideal for catching chipmunks , rats , squirrels and similar-size nuisance animals7.1 '' long ~ 2.4 '' wide ~ 3.5 '' high.Medium ~ Ideal for catching rabbits , skunks , squirrels and similar-size nuisance animals . ( this one ) 25 '' long ~ 7 '' wide ~ 7 1/4 '' highLarge ~ Ideal for catching raccoons , stray cats , groundhogs ( woodchucks ) , opossums , and similar-size nuisance animals.32 '' long ~ 10 '' wide ~ 12 '' high .	1
We bought this ~1 week ago and we 've caught 2 groundhogs thus far . We used strawberries for ours . We grated some strawberry on the cage , then tossed one in the back of the cage . We set it next to their burrow , then literally waited 1-2 days each.Some suggestions : Make sure to place the cage so you can check it from afar . We did n't know we caught one for a good portion of the day . Luckily it was a cooler day , so he/she was ok. Also make sure to weight the cage a bit , bc sometimes a moving cage will spook them back out of it . Had no problems with opening the door afterwards , but make sure to open it away from you because they nearly fly out of it !	1
This is the perfect size for catching the large raccoons and woodchucks eating inside our fenced garden . Having only one door assures that an animal has to enter far enough into the trap for the door to close . So far the trap has caught an animal each day .	1
I had a raccoon problem , used peanut butter sandwich ( small bits each night ) and each night I got a coon . its easy to set , tho after you have had many wild animals in it , the latch may need to be worked on a bit . after two full years of outside use , and many many coons , I am in need of a new one . a really large raccoon bent the bottom too much to be reworked but I figure I have gotten my money for the first one in the first 2 weeks , as I was getting rid of my coon family one per night.and , no , its not the same one coming back , we simply had that many.my advice , put the bait in the far back corner and place your trap so the front opening is easy to see and get in , but the rest of the trap I had tucked in to bushes just enough to hide some of it but not get any branches in the way of the trap shutting . check your trap right away in the morning , you dont want an animal trapped longer than he needs to be . it is unlawful to relocate wild animals , so know ahead of time what you will do with the animal once its in the trap . besides , on one wants your infestation on their property . ( a nice farm is a bad idea , farmers I know shoot raccoons and other relocated pests FYI )	1
I put my bait ( peanut butter ) on the top of the entrance box so it gets between these and the lid . Attracts great and the mice ca n't get to it so the same bait works for months.No setting required , you do n't even really need bait if well placed . I keep these under garage shelving , under stairs , in the floor of the pantry , etc . and just let them sit until successful.There is another model with a clear lid , not needed and these do n't have plastic to break . An unadvertised benefit is that these have a `` built in alarm '' of the catch . The mouse ( or mice ) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.If you want to release live , thats great , but if you want to dispose of the mice , just take the trap and set it in the sun for a bit and the mice will expire fairly quickly .	1
We get a lot of mice when the weather turns cold . I 've tried every type of mouse trap on the market , including spring traps , repeating traps , electronic traps , etc . The old-fashioned spring traps are the best and cheapest solution , but they can be a bit gruesome . This tin cat trap is the most reliable alternative I 've found . When I hear , see , or smell mice , I put this out and invariably end up finding mice in it the next morning . The first tin cat that I bought almost 20 years ago is still catching mice.A few important notes : - This is only a live catch mouse trap if you check it daily . You ca n't expect to catch mice , leave them in the trap for a week , and expect to find live critters the next weekend . If they die in the trap , you 'll face a smelly clean up task.- I noticed a lot of reviews from people who said the trap stopped working . In my experience , this is almost always because something has gotten wedged under the trap-door ramp . Often it seems to be because the mice crawl into the semi-enclosed trap door spaces to die if you do n't empty the trap in time . If the trap is outdoors , twigs and bits of sand can blow up the trap-door ramps and keep them from working . 95 % of the time , just banging the trap on the ground a few times dislodges whatever is in the way . About 2-3 times a year , I spray off the inside of the trap with a garden hose , which seems to clean out remaining debris just fine.In a nutshell : This is a great trap design that consistently catches mice and has worked for me for decades . In my experience , the trap has proven to be very reliable and durable with an occasional bit of cleaning .	1
We had tried 3 other traps with no results . This one finally caught out tiny friend and I was able to let him go free in a nearby field . I was happy knowing that the mouse did n't have to die just because he dared to come into my home . He was happy to be living and not with a broken neck.Its a win/ win !	1
I bought two of these at a large , orange home improvement store two days ago after reading reviews on Amazon . Same price as here , by the way . Set them that evening , in the dark , using the technique advocated by other reviewers here ... that is , gently tamped down a small section of a main , straight run until level with ground , cut grooves on either side for the trap jaws to sit in , set tap , and set trap down in grooves with the release lever sitting against the tamped-down ground . One day passed with no action , but after a whole lot of rain yesterday evening , the mole was in the trap this morning ! He was caught in the edge of the jaws , telling me I could have planted the trap a tiny bit deeper . There is another method advocated online involving digging out a section of the mole run , building a dirt bridge across the hole , placing the trap down in the hole , and covering with dirt . This might be an even better strategy , but either way , I 'm happy with the result . I left the traps out , just in case another mole decides to make use of his subterranean highway system . Will update if there is any more action , positive or negative .	1
Update June 3 , 2011More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap . This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed . I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run , pressed the soil down and placed the trap . Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap . I had set two traps and the second one did n't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.Original reviewFive hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole ; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped ; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole , the trap had done its job perfectly.I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first . When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard . I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive . I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down . Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay ; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement . Before I placed the trap that caught the mole ; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed ; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area . I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set ; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me . It does take some pressure to set the trap ; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil . Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs . This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.I will update this review if anything of interest happens . In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole .	1
This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it . If you bury it ( which the directions will tell you to do ) it will simply NOT work . If your `` out o sight '' trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.When the very expensive exterminator ( who we now refer to as `` Mark the Mole Man '' ) came to our house , I showed him our `` out of sight '' mole trap . He tried to be respectful but finally just said , `` Ma'am , that 's too deep . Ai n't gon na kill nothin ' . '' As it turns out , this is exactly the same type of trap he uses . He just knows how to use it correctly.He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles . He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills ( please do n't give PETA my address . ) Finally he stopped , stood silently for a moment , then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil . Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel , and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.Then , artist that he was , Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil . Released the safety and - Done . He placed three more in the back yard ( BIG yard ) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.It was a wonderful ( and for us expensive ) experience . Go get your nasty little critter with this trap , but do n't follow their directions . Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos .	1
I admit it - I 'm very , very ambivalent about harming any creature , even one that tears up our lawn the way moles do . But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we ( reluctantly ) decided to cut down on the mole invasion . We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor 's office . We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK . If you want a trap that quickly kills moles , these do . They also seem to keep suffering to a minimum . I 'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt one of these traps go off . The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out , less than a minute later.Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes . I admit ... if we 'd only had an occasional mole hole , I would have stayed away from traps . We are animal lovers . We have pets.But the situation was becoming dangerous . I did n't want anyone to get hurt walking across our yard .	1
This trap is great . I 've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap , you realize it is simply awesome . As mentioned by others : DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots ( 2 ) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface -- enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily ... you 'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out , I 've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks ! ! ! ***WARNING : check the laws in your city/state . These traps may be prohibited . One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are `` leghold , steel-jawed traps '' . I will be going to court soon ...	1
They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones . I do n't have to worry about losing my fingers . I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it , and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed , but at least I get them . And eventually they are not so lucky . It 's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them . Even my kid can do it without harm to her .	1
Occasionally a mouse will not get killed and will drag the trap away . This has not been a problem as I hav always found the trap and mouse within a short distance .	1
Every fall/winter season a few mice find their way into our basement pantry . I think I 've tried every deterrent out there -- sticky boards , poisons , quick-set and traditional traps . Like outdoor chipmunks , these mice are clever . Poison blocks do n't seem to interest them , and they know how to side-step sticky boards.So far , I have had the best luck with these cheaply made plastic Victor traps . I bought two types of quick-set traps -- these Victor ones andSnap-E Mouse Trap by Kness ( based that purchase on popular reviews ) . Even though Victor 's snap is n't very strong , it does indeed kill mice . I have yet to catch anything with the Kness traps . They have a stronger snap , but so far all I 've come up with are sprung , empty traps . The same bait is used for both traps ( peanut butter ) .I do n't care how mice are caught , as long as the job gets done . This season , Victor Quick Set mouse traps are proven winners . I do n't think they 'll last a long time , but they certainly outperform sticky boards and are easier to set than the old-fashioned method .	1
Having been unable to create a method of capturing marauding mice and teleporting them unharmed to another galaxy , I resorted to a humane trap , intending to drive them several miles into the county and release them to find their county mouse cousins . Alas and alack , the mice were able to enter the humane traps , retrieve the bait ( peanut butter on a bit of cracker ) and exit the traps with the bait . Perhaps they work in pairs with one holding the door open while the other goes in for the food . With a heavy heart I next purchased a pair of these traps . For many nights the mice could count on their evening meal , the bait strategically placed in various places in this trap . They walzed in , dined , and left , no doubt laughing their little tails off . It seems a human with a master 's degree in psychology is no match for the average rodent . Then , wonder of wonders , last night the traps actually lured two hapless diners to their death . My delight was short lived upon reading reviews here that the mice do not die instantly , but might suffer for a time before expiring . What 's a person to do ? My advice , if you do purchase this type trap , is to use just the smallest amount of bait ( my successful last night bait was cream cheese ) which I rubbed the entire length of the pressure activated metal strip . I think previously I was using too large a piece of cheese or cream cheese . I suppose I 'll continue to use the traps , as I have to get this problem resolved though it 's awful to think of them suffering at all .	1
Gets fleas AND anything else that tries to scuttle past it -- with the night light and the ( perhaps nice smelling ? ) sticky pad it is quite attractive to creepy crawlers.Two things -- 1 ) use disposable gloves while changing the sticky pad . Saying & # 34 ; eeeyew ! ! & # 34 ; is optional.2 ) Do not think that this will catch all the fleas that might happen to infest your home and pets -- Use a sensible flea reduction program in addition to this..	1
This is a refill package only and requires you have already purchased the Victor Flea Trap . Our experience with the flea trap has been very good and we have noticed the trap catches anything that happens to stray on its surface.The refills install easily and quickly . We have had to install a new bulb in the trap but that was also easily done . We leave the trap behind a sofa in the den and have noticed a steady decrease in trapped fleas as we 've used it.This is a good supplement to flea control and can be safely used with pets .	1
This is a review of the refills , followed by the same review as the trap . The refills are easy to use , they come with a separate protective layer for each refill and it 's fairly convenient to use the protective layer to cover the old , flea infested sticky trap when replacing it with a new refill . Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.For the trap itself : I have 2 of these for 2 different locations . Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas ; but they wo n't arrest an infestation . I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I 'm getting it under control . Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture , not so tough to find on the dogs.The traps work best at night , do n't seem to do much of anything during the day . If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out . This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic 's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs ( separate reveiws for those ) . I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective , and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that 's a good indicator the fleas are gone.If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself , there 's a good chance you 'll be disappointed . It might work , but I was n't willing to wait that long .	1
I first started using theVictor Ultimate Flea Trapwhen I lived in California because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door . We also did n't want to use any pesticides , since we had four small house pets.When we moved to Michigan , we continued using the traps because our child was born , and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides . Although we did not have a flea problem , the traps have caught several types of spiders , the occasional house fly , a few random creepy crawlies , and even a hornet ! Basically , they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.We keep them tucked away , out of sight ( ex : in a back corner of our furnace room , under furniture ) , and in places where the pets ca n't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin ( or dog fur ) is the absolute worse.All in all , I think we 've been using these traps for nearly ten years now . The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs .	1
I bought this to clear out the thick tangle of thatch in my front yard from years of neglect . I was amazed at how easily the blades slip through the soil , leaving the grass pretty much intact and pulling up all of the detritus . If you have a pet and have ever used a Furminator , it 's basically like that for the yard . Love it .	1
This has two sides . One is better for thatch removal , the other side is good for cultivating the soil a bit.I 've been able to use this rake to prepare hard soil for grass seed planting.It is sturdy , well designed , and manufactured with good materials .	1
The head is attached to the shaft securely and doe not feel like it is going anywhere . However , the individual metal tines bend quite easily and care should be taken to ensure that they are straight , or it is going to make your thatching job harder than it needs to be.Also , thatching a large lawn by hand really sucks !	1
This thatch rake is great for SMALL spots . If you plan on doing an entire yard , go rent a machine . It takes a LOT of effort to use this rake on Augustine grass in Texas . Having said that , the rake works as intended and is high quality / durable .	1
I tried to dethatch my yard with an ordinary rake and found it exhausting . A thatching rake like this makes the job so much easier ! It 's still a lot of exercise , to be sure , but you 'll certainly be glad you got this . This rake is heavy duty , high quality , and perfectly suited for the job.The head on my rake was silver in color ( not black like the picture ) , but I do n't care about this discrepancy . It otherwise is the same rake .	1
Not for the faint hearted but a great arm exercise . This thing does pull up lots of dead grasses . Had this for more than 18mths now and it is one of the better tools . But with 5000 sq ft lawn , this is not a long term solution . The metal teeth will bend inwards if you use it forcefully enough ; especially when lawn is wet . Not a big deal but can be frustrating each time you try to straighten it back . I 'll continue to use this tool for small areas . For whole yard maintenance , I 've upgraded to an electrical detatcher . [ Greenworks 27022 14-Inch 10 Amp Electric Dethatcher - http : //www.amazon.com/review/R1MTQOPVBA281X/ref=cm_cr_ryp_cmt ? ie=UTF8 & channel=ryp ]	1
- Many different modes of patterns to choose from- Fairly cheap feel , but it works , and for the price I ca n't complain.- Does n't quite seem to get the water pressure I like especially on the more concentrated stream settings , but again for the price its a useful nozzle.- Mostly used for washing the car , and the 7 settings come in handy there.- Amazon delivered quickly	1
This nozzle really fits the bill with good spray patterns that work well , good water pressure and good ease of use . Because it 's plastic , I 'll have to take it in for the winter lest it leak next season , but so far it does n't leak at all . Each of the patterns is distinct in its function and useful and something about the design allows great water pressure where you need it even if you have a well and lower pressure overall , as I do.The gentle shower pattern , a favorite for me , works really nicely with a nice overall spray and decent enough pressure to water the back of my 8 ' deep garden as effectively as the front . The jet is great . The pattern ring does n't turn quite as easily as my Toro nozzle , nor is the trigger quite as easy to squeeze , but both are quite doable even with arthritis in my hands and the lock is easy to flip into place so you do n't have to squeeze the trigger for long periods . The patterns are so much more effective than the more expensive red and silver Toro , I 'm definitely replacing others with this one when needed . I 'll leave the Toro on in the winter , because if it cracks and leaks , I wo n't really care . This is a great nozzle that meets a lot of needs from vegetable gardens to potted plants .	1
Over the winter our nozzle somehow got lost . This nozzle is a great price . It has lots of settings to choose from and is comfortable to hold . It screws on easily . I am very happy with its performance , and am satisfied with this purchase .	1
have had it for over a year now with no complaints . This is easily my favorite sprayer . Liked it so much I have one for the front AND the back hoses .	1
The construction and material are sturdy , no complaints about that . All the settings work great . There is just a missing option I think . There 's & # 34 ; Center & # 34 ; which does the center holes , & # 34 ; Shower & # 34 ; which does the outer - but not one that does both . Need more water for the plants !	1
This has worked well for me with one exception . It must be removed from the hose in the winter . If it freezes it cracks and will spray everywhere next time you use it .	1
Best I ever had or would need for basic yard watering and spraying off the sidewalk , etc . So much happier with it than my other sprayer , I just ordered another for the front yard.Pros : - Feels like total control in your hands- Plenty of great settings for the spray- Mist spray is wonderful- Does n't leak ( or bathe you ) - This is real quality , so great priceCons : - None	1
Nice nozzle and cheap enough so I can have several around the house . The pattern selection works find ( stream and flat get the most use by me ) .	1
This spray nozzle is pretty sturdy ... self explanatory , no need of directions , just turn the knob to whatever settings you want . All spray dials works just fine ... have been using this for a little while ( no complaints ) . I highly recommend , even for decent price .	1
this nozzle has a comfy grip and good selection of water spray patterns and is well made so i expect it to last for several years . would recommend this nozzle	1
I thought the 7 patterns might be overkill , but each one is truly different.It is durable and responsive.There is not much more to say , but is is inexpensive not cheap.Glad I bought it !	1
I like it . It is heavy and I use it as a base for my new impact sprinkler . I made sure after the first use that I disconnected it and drained it , the put it over a chair to dry in the sun -- do n't want the rust problem if I can prevent it . Good purchase -- I had never heard of this thing before .	1
There is n't much to say about this sprinkler base . Sometimes the simplest design is the best , and in this case it is . Strong , durable and it works great . I expect to have it for years to come .	1
I leave it out , tow it around with the hose attached and forget to drain it come winter . Still working great after two years !	1
I purchased this to use with the Rain Bird sprinkler . It does the job well . One thing that I had to learn was the base holds water which has rust in it . When you disconnect this from the hose be sure that you empty the ring base and do n't soak yourself with rusty water .	1
I initially purchased one for use with a rain bird plastic impact rotor sprinkler , I put an 18 & # 34 ; extension from the metal ring to the rotor . Works awesome ! I have since bought three more and use one of those with another rotor , and the other two for shrub style bubblers/sprayers for my plants in the the mulch beds . One negative which is n't a huge issue for me is that if you leave water sit in it , there will be rusty water . I always disconnect the hose each time and pour out any excess water so it 's not an issue , but I can see that if I did n't do that with time it could rust through or clog your sprinkler head possibly .	1
i had a couple of spike impact sprinkler , and eventually the spikes for some reason got bend . go figure . So i ordered 2 of these to replace the spikes , and they work great . the impact sprinklers fit in well . I 've had them for 3 years now with no issues . Not much more to say . Buy them with confidence .	1
I am a working Certified Arborist , ISA . THIS is the best tool out there for pruning , no debate possible . I use this pruner daily . Fiskars has the BEST customer support , as well . Nobody else comes close . They have sent me replacement parts for everything on this unit , as I needed them . They have even sent me two brand new units that sit unopened in my work shed , when I simply requested new cutting heads for two units . They sent me new heads , as well . They have NEVER charged me one penny for replacement parts or the two , new units . I strongly recommend this tool . Again , you can not do better .	1
I had a cable driven long pruner , and besides the fact that it ... near broke my hand to clip a large branch with it , the thing was fragile . I used to live on nearly and acre of property with a row of pines along the back . They would get all brown near the bottom so I would try and prune them up to about the point where they could get enough sun to stay green . To do that you need a pruner with a little reach to it ? I saw this model on TV and hunted it down , finding it first on Amazon . I could barely believe the price quoted on the TV show , ( it was n't a commercial , it was a how-to show ) they said the stick only cost about [ $ $ $ ] . Its not quite that cheap , but the quality here is excellent . It uses a chain , not unlike a bike chain , to drive the extended cutter . It uses a slider , leverage system to pull the chain to make the cuts . The cutting blades themselves are very sharp and can be adjusted to any angle . This becomes an important concern when you have about a dozen pine trees to trip.The stick will also do fine when you do n't need the extended length . Remember those hedge trimmers that looked like a huge pair of scissors ? I used to hurt my wrists every year , trying to get enough momentum to trim the bushes in front of the house I was renting . If you tried to cut too , slow it would get stuck , too fast , and the handles would stop abruptly hurting my wrists ! This cutter , although smaller than a hedge trimmer , cut so quick and easily that it made trimming the bushes a pleasure . I could even get lazy , and sit down in a chair , and do them from a distance . Try that with your electric model ! The bushes never shaped up so well before.The blades will cut close to a one-inch branch , and I have n't had to sharpen it yet . Just keep the chain free of dirt , and keep a little mower oil on it , or cycle spray and it continues to work like new . Sometimes they just make a tool that becomes the defacto standard for a while , and for my money this is it . Do n't risk cutting your arm off with a chainsaw . If you 've got a little pruning to do , get this Pruning Stik and start clipping away .	1
This pruning stick works like a charm . Pull down on the handle or the end ball and voila , cuts through 1+ '' branches with relative ease.Safety is the name of the game.Thorns and prickles gone.You 've got 62 '' distance between you and some pain . Lower levels on the ladder.This is a must have for anyone having to prune any brush of height or thorns..I have had mine for about 5yrs and it is still in excellent shape.Seems like the cutting mechanism should last a long long time.The pivoting head is very useful as well .	1
For most yard trimming this pruner is great . Easy to adjust , cuts limbs like butter , and is light . I have the 12 foot model also , but for most yard trimming this one is perfect . I have used it to trim low limbs on my Silver Maples , a variety of yard shrubs , my Magnolia trees , and woody stemmed weeds . Anyone can use this one . Great trimmer .	1
This pruning stick is the best thing to come along in a long time . I had been trying to figure out how to prune our big Rhododendron bush without ruining its shape , but no matter how I tried , I just could n't get at the top . This stick allows selective pruning while on a ladder or from the ground . It is lightweight and comfortable to handle . Definitely well worth the price .	1
The first one I owned my teenage son tried using it on a limb that was too big and applied too much pressure which caused it to break . As far as I am concerned it was not the companies fault that this unit was abused . I keep it now for spare parts.I am very impressed with the second one I bought . It has paid for it 's self many times over and has never given me any problems when it is used properly.I am disabled with arthritis . I do not like heights . This unit is very easy to use and as it stands now I should get many more years of use from mine .	1
I never had much of a brand loyalty for routine yard maintenance stuff until I had a problem with an old fiskars pole saw . The hardware couldnt hold the poles anymore . When I contacted fiskars about it ( limited lifetime warranty ) they sent me a part . When the post office didnt deliver it ( a common problem here ) they sent me a whole new $ 80 saw by fed ex . When I come across actual customer service , I buy as long as the service is good . Fiskars earned my business and I now look for their products where available.This is a nice pruning stick . Unlike loppers , you can stick this into a shrub or low tree and cut a branch off without needing the linear clearance to open and close the lopper . The mechanism works very well and allows me to trim up my hedges without sticking my arms into them ( we have wasps and black widows ) or going through trying to use a lopper and having it hit adjacent branches.Not the only tool you need , but its a great addition . Like most fiskars products , its very well made .	1
No more getting down on my hands and knees to cut grass that the mower ca n't reach . I use this to cut grass around my mailbox post , the street lamp post on my property , the big metal box the electric company uses to feed me from its underground cable , the post the cable company uses as my feed point and anywhere else that grass needs cutting which the mower ca n't handle.These shears are lightweight , are easy to use , cut the grass cleanly and , best of all , they let me stand up while using them . They do not require a battery , power cord , string or anything else besides a hand . Very handy , very useful and very good .	1
These shears cut just as well as standard ones , without the back strain . Also very easy to reach under bushes , plants , etc . to do a better job of trimming . They seem pretty sturdy as well . Very happy with this purchase . Only caveat -- if you are tall I think the handle would be a bit short and still require some bending .	1
These Fiskars 9210 Long-Handled Swivel Grass Shears will literally save wear and tear on your back and knees both when you have any small yard trimming to do . These are not made for grass trimming around the perimeter of a large yard , as your hand would wear out from squeezing the handle . We use the electric string trimmer to trim the grass against the fence around our entire yard . As for all the other trimming in the yard- around the house , the garage , around bushes , trees , sidewalks , the patio , gardens , corners and utility poles , these Fiskars Grass Shears are just perfect ! These shears are meant to trim grass and lighter plants , not anything thick , but since grass is always growing around everything in our yard , they get a constant workout . The 3 foot height is just perfect- no bending or stooping ever . There is an orange turning device on the blades , allowing you to turn these blades to any angle you need . The blades actually turn a full 360 degrees . The 5 inch blades are fully hardened for long lasting sharpness and also lock for storage or when you are turning them . We noticed they do come with a slight oil on the blades themselves.I contacted Fiskars and asked about any maintenance for the blades , and they told me they should stay sharp for years , but you could add a sharper edge to them in time with a hand sharpener- similar to a lawn mower blade sharpener . Cleaning and lightly oiling them when they become dirty will keep them cutting perfect . Fiskars actually has a lifetime guarantee against any defects in workmanship . For under $ 35.00 , these are a must have for saving my back and knees with the constant maintenance of yard trimming . These are not just for older people , as I 've always had bad knees- and I wish I had known about these years ago ! The thought of trimming all the constant grass around the yard made me not want to do it . I 'd have to get out my small shears , my knee pad or a stool to sit on- depending on the height of the grass or weeds . Afterwards , I 'd need my heating pad and linament for my aching back and knees , not to mention Aleve or some other pain killer . Spending so much time in pain made me dread trimming . Now , I just grab the Fiskars Long Handled Shears- stand , trim and that 's it . These shears are worth much more than 5 STARS , and I know I will never be without them again , as saving my back and knees are worth everything !	1
I finally broke down and bought a more expensive pair of pruners than usual . The blades on these are great ! Small branches and more cut easily , quickly and cleanly . They are certainly a lot more comfortable to hold than the cheap $ 7 sheers I 've purchased in the past.My biggest issue with them so far is the orange hold-close tab broke almost immediately . They have a life time warranty , but of course I threw away the receipt and all of the packing materials .	1
This is a great pruner . It is easy on arthritic hands and is quite sharp . It works well on everything except larger branches .	1
Got to love a pruner that is ergonomically correct and puts pressure on the bush and not your thumb and forefinger . Got to love a pruner that stays sharp after many seasons of work . Got to love a pruner that stays rust-free even though we leave it out on the back porch . Should n't come as a surprise : We love anything Fiskars !	1
I have used these for 4 years and love them . First I 'm 70 years old and do have some Arthritis so these are a real boon to me . If I can get a branch between the blades I can cut it without strain . Strong spring that opens them ( nice ) but will say if you had small hands might be a bit large for you . The rolling handle took some getting use to , worked well but was different than anything I had used before , like it now though . I would recommend these to anyone . I have several Fiskars tools , geared loppers , pruning poles etc. , and that really is the reason I bought these since the others work great for me and all have held up to work . When I read some of the bad reviews of these I have to remember some people need instructions on which end of a knife to hold while using . These let me trim faster and with less effort than anything I have ever used , believe me I 've used several and cussed most of them . Fiskars also makes others that are smaller in size if these are too large for you . No I do n't work for Fiskars , just totally impressed and sold on their loppers and pruners .	1
These pruners are very easy on your wrists ( and I have wrist problems ) ! They really do cut through limbs just like the photo in the images section ! My pruners are on their 3rd summer with little maintenance required . When these finally bite the dust , I 'll replace them with another Fiskars PowerGear Pruner . I am right handed and tried using the pruners with my left - it does n't really work as one reviewer noted .	1
This the next best thing to having a full size lopper in the palm of your hand . It 's very strong with a power gear mechanism that makes cutting painless . Because of the power gear action , the trigger handle rotates , softening the blow when the sheers get through the branch . With traditional sheers , the snapping action can be painful after an hour or two of heavy duty pruning.These are heavy pruners , the grip is very comfortable . I 've only had these for two years , but it 's going strong . I would n't recommend it for professional u because of the exposed coil spring which is likely get clogged or damaged under heavy abuse , but it 's great for the home owner.This performs the job of countless other cutting implements ( small sheers to a medium duty lopper ) . It 's not a delicate cutter , but until recently , I was using it to deadhead my flowers with good results .	1
I 've had this pruner for several years , and I 've used it for a variety of tasks , including pruning roses and other bushes , to trimming off small tree branches . I 've even used it for branches that were probably too thick for the tool , but when you have it handy , sometimes you use a tool for a purpose that it was n't intended . Even when I try to go through something too large , it has n't broken or jammed in such a way where I could n't remove it and take it from another angle to finish the cut . That shows how durable it really is.I 've had no issues with using this pruner for all those tasks , as it allows me to trim individual faded rose buds with one hand . The spring-loaded handle keeps the resistance at the right amount so it is n't necessary to fiddle around with it just to keep a decent grip.If I were to lose this pruner , or if it were to finally break , I would not hesitate to purchase another one as a replacement . I 'm very satisfied with it and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of tool .	1
When I placed my order I had some misgivings about these hand pruners . That is because I could not tell by Amazon 's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is . Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review . I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review . I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners . Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them . This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort . A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic . I immediately saw that I was wrong . All the parts that count are of high quality metal . I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them . They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate . They are SO EASY to use . Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones . They cut them with ease . The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch . I believe they could but I refuse to do it . I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them . I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers . I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job . I have never done that before with an Amazon product . That is how impressed I am with these pruners . If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs . I very much doubt I will have to do that . I think 99 % of all people who buy these pruners will be happy with them .	1
I needed a pruner to fight bittersweet vine . Due to several back surgeries I do n't have a lot of strength in my hands , so I was looking for a pruner that was light and easy to use . I got this 15 '' Fiskars pruner this weekend in local home improvement store and spent several hours cutting my pesky vines . The pruner worked great ! It cut every vine I found and it was easy ! The pruner weights 13 ounces , and has a PowerGear design that really helps amplify the strength needed to do the cutting . I am attaching a collage of 5 photos ( you can find the photos by following 'customers photo ' link under the main photo ) . The photos show the pruner and some of the vines I cut and took home to measure.Photo # 1 and photo # 2 show the pruner opened and closed . Photo # 3 and Photo # 4 show one of the bigger vines I have cut : 3 inches in circumference and a bit over 7/8 inches in diameter . Photo # 5 shows the vine that was snaking up one of my big fur trees.Overall , I am very pleased . This pruner was easy to use and did a good job ! Ali Julia review	1
These are great . Had the old ones for years and I confess , they were occasionally abused . I took a sharpener to the blade and got a few more miles out of them before deciding I needed to break down and buy new ones . Works on branches that were surprisingly large ( sorry ! ) but I hope to treat these better than the old ones .	1
It had been years since I had a new pruner and the one I have most would consider `` vintage '' . So when I chose this pruner , I chose on the brand I know has quality and endurable products . This pruner is lightweight and sharp . I did n't realize how good a pruner can when when you have one that works !	1
I used this product to trim shrub and tree branches around my yard . I can easily carry it around the yard because it is the perfect length and is light weight . I will also note that the blades are sharp and pinch through branches with ease . The Fiskars trimmer is a great addition to any garden cart especially if you want a quality trimmer for all your yard work needs .	1
This little tool is deceiving . It can cut those thick branches in one swipe . My husband even uses it . It is a big surprise what it can cut with no effort .	1
Finally a decent pair of loppers . Quality construction . I love the gear setup and handles that wo n't come loose.They are a breeze to use .	1
The gear mechanism does assist your chopping power.This is a solid branch cutter and as long as you clean your cutting edges , the tool should operate for a long time .	1
cuts through branches like butter , not needing a lot of force at all . super sharp and the design makes it take less energy to get it done	1
These Fiskars are the very thing to have on hand , They cut really good and smooth . I like the long reach too because the short ones you will need a ladder more for taller trees .	1
OK , I ordered these because I have some hand pruners by Fiskars and love them . These did not disappoint . I have been using them all over our new yard to cut back overgrown lavender , smoke bush , and branches . Today I thought I 'd give them a try in the woods next to the house that `` could '' be a beautiful fire pit or gazebo area ... eventually . I took these through dead and alive saplings . And to clarify-these were 1 '' -3 '' saplings . While it handled the recommended size of 2 '' easily , I found with some maneuvering and going around the tree in a circle I could also take down larger ones . Then I worked on cutting the smaller branches off , all still cutting with ease like they were brand new . No dulling or sticking- a perfect cut each time.I worked at this for about an hour- plus all the other times I 've been out with these ... I would definitely buy another pair in the future - but these don/t seem like they will be wearing our anytime soon !	1
I cut down two very dead shrubs today using these and was very impressed with these lightweight loppers . I did n't think I 'd get the heavier two-inch branches cut because these loppers are so light , but with the right grip the gear holds the wood down and cuts the branch cleanly in half with little effort . I 'm not the strongest person out there and I 'm certainly no Hercules , but these loppers made the trim job for me fairly easy.Although these may be harder to use in dense shrub because you need a wide opening for these to work effectively , once you have a grip on the wood the cutting is easy . And , since they are somewhat long , you can also reach up rather high . Overall , a very well-engineered set.They are attractive on top of it , and look impressive in my tool corner .	1
Fiskars 32 Inch PowerGear Bypass Lopper ( 9154 ) . Now this is a great Lopper , I use it a lot and it makes trimming easy .	1
Love it , one of best products I have ever ordered period . I could n't believe how effordless this thing cuts thru even thick branches several inches wide . It is very easy to use , light in weight but very solid construction and feel , even makes cutting branches fun if you can believe that . I cut down twenty branches and three small trees in under a few minutes . I was looking around for more things to cut . Seems very well built . I ca n't think of a single thing that could have added on this thing to make it better Price is great . One reviewer gave it one star because the blade is curved so you have to open the tool 's jaws slightly more . I am not sure but would bet the curved blade has something to do with just how easy this thing cuts . I have another cutter that does n't have curved blades and it ca n't cut nowhere near as powerful as this tool . Tool is fantastic . Very Highly recommend Many Times over ! ! ! Would give it twenty stars if could ! ! ! ! Good job to the people who designed this product ! !	1
There is power to spare with this lopper . Yes , it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless . This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting . When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased . As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot . Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade . This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess . I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a rare flaw in the metal . Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper .	1
This 32 inch loppers is a great addition to our yard work tools ! ! I am a short lady , and have no problem snipping branches around our yard . The long sturdy handles make it easy to get leverage and trip harder to reach branches , and I have seen great improvement in our curb appeal because of this great loppers !	1
This is a great addition to my growing gardening tool collection . This tool will make it easier to prune tall tree limbs in the fall . The Fiskars quality in sewing instruments in why I purchase the brand for my outdoor activities .	1
I bought it in a local store on sale , for $ 29.99 , mine is the same model , only 32 '' . Funny , because on the fiskars website there 's no mention of the product ! I compared it to other alternatives , that can cut 2 '' branches , and this model came out as number one ! It cuts wood like butter ! Mine is very light weight , has titanium blade , hollow aluminum arms , with rubber handles.I fear I bought a product that may be more powerful than the product can actually handle ! Meaning , it may be good for casual use of cutting branches upto 2 '' .But perhaps not industrial use ! That 's why they probably decreased the size of the gripper to 25 '' and 31 '' instead of 32 '' .Nevertheless , I just use it for some thorn bushes in my garden , and think it 's well worth the $ 30 I spent ! Even mine ( 32 inch ) is very light weight , I can easily lift it up with one arm stretched , to cut off the furthest branches , and I 'm a pretty skinny and weak guy ! One cutting blade seems titanium , the other some sort of treated metal alloy . Only one of the two is a blade , the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I 've seen , this one cuts the branch like a scissor , not squeezes the branch like pliers ; which means , you wo n't have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches ( upto 2 inch ) ! I highly recommend this one ! ; and that 's very high praise coming off of my lips ! ( those who know me , know I 'm usually very skeptic , and thorough in reviewing the bad sides ) .If anything bad about this device , is that it 's not on the manufacturers website ( the 32 inch model ) , and that it 's probably not made for mass pruning on an industrial scale , eventhough it would probably outlive a DIY-er pruning gardens in his days off !	1
This tool makes unpleasant pruning tasks much more pleasant and the ease of cutting makes the work a lot more pleasant ! ( If you can bear to think of it that way ! ) It really takes the effort out of cutting thick branches . I carry this lopper along with my smaller pruner -- and I do n't struggle trying to use the pruner on bush that 's too thick for it . Makes the whole pruning job go faster.I use this on our numerous rose bushes , too . The length comes in real handy when I 'm trying to avoid the thorns.In our neck-of-the-woods , we 'll be pruning our roses in mid-February . So now is not too early to start thinking about Spring-time gardening chores .	1
Boy this looper is sharp and strong . My wife uses it and loves it . The gearing is amazing strong . We have cut tree branches about 2 inches and no problem	1
This is an excellent pruner/lopper and the rachet allows extra pressure on the blades when needed . Well made and rugged .	1
Bought these to trim some larger bushes and small branches on a big pine tree . These loppers work perfectly fine and are fairly light . Although they seem to be a little more expensive , they are built well and should last a long time . Remember to oil the blade and hinge after use , to keep it working properly and to prevent rust .	1
Alright then , these are amazing at what they will cut with very little effort on my part . Quality made ! Save yourself the aggravation of lesser loppers . Just get these and be done with it .	1
These do everything the company says . I was surprised at how easy larger limbs were to cut compared to my old loppers . My wife tried these and was really pleased at how easy it was to cut limbs . ( Hint , Hint , guys ) Let me say I would not have tried to cut some of the big limbs with my old loppers ( now gone to lopper heaven ) . If the jaws of these loppers fit around a limb they will cut it and so can you . Only once did I have a problem opening them ( handles ) wide enough to fit a limb inside a shrub , it was a big one . Most of the time I could find an angle to reach through with and cut inside limbs with no problem . I would recommend these to anyone who like me enjoys easy work . At 66 years old and surviveing throat cancer surgery I need that too .	1
I have owned this thing for years . It is hands-down my all-time favorite gardening tool . I used to use your old-school loppers which became tiring to use and had trouble cutting thick branches . I was in Home Depot one day and decided to spend the big bucks and get this thing . It was my first Fiskars purchase ever , and ever since then I have been SOLD on this company . These loppers are AMAZING . I can cut branches , even tree roots , thicker than ever before with ease . The gears on this thing make it possible to use this for a long period of time without tiring your arms as much . Very efficent and effective tool . Easily my favorite most-effective gardening tool I 've ever bought . I highly recommend this to you if you are in the market for some loppers . Or if you know someone who likes to mess around the yard ( especially older folks - this is so much easier on the joints ) , then get this as a gift . It 's just the best ! ** UPDATE 12/11/2102 **I just bought this as a gift for someone this Christmas . They work outdoors around the house and actually were using these same loppers , but they were 16 years old at that point ( the loppers , not the person ! ) . They had n't cared for them or sharpened them and they are in really bad shape . So - a replacement is what they 're getting for Christmas ! I do still love these things !	1
I just used these to cut up some pine branches that came down in a horrendous windstorm and they WORKED LIKE A CHAMP ! ! ! No effort and it cut through 2 '' branches effortlessly . I am so glad I happened upon the Gold Deals when they were featured . They even came in ONE day . Thanks Amazon ! ! ! Fiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper	1
The leverage you get from this looper is insane ! The gear pivot gives you a lot of leverage to cut through anything that 'll fit in the blade when opened . The only trick is making sure you open the handles WIDE in order to fit branches .	1
Trees and shrubs grow year-round here in Hawaii , and trimming is a constant job . I much prefer using this & # 8212 ; no cords , more control and a bit of exercise & # 8212 ; over an electric trimmer .	1
I think I have three or four , maybe more . I 'd have to go up into the attic to check . These work better than my Felcos which is saying a lot .	1
Great piece of equipment for the price ! They are very light weight and has plenty of power torque behind it . I would definately buy another one of these in the future !	1
This lopper has actually exceeded my expectations . The only reason you buy one of these is to lop off tree branches and limbs , as well as extra bush and vine growth . This thing requires no real strength to use whatsoever , and i have now lopped limbs as much as three inches in diameter with no problems at all . Definitely well worth the $ 30 or so that they currently costs . Helped me to clear a lot of extra growth in no time.Enjoy !	1
I purchased this at Home Depot . It can cut 2 '' or even 2.5 '' branches with relative ease . But there is one issue . The cutting blade broke at some point . I did n't notice it until I had problems getting the cut to go all the way through . However , I went to the Fiskars website [ ... ] and found out the live chat button and explained the issue to the customer rep. She sent a new one out that day and I received it in 3 business days . Installing the new blade was very easy and it worked just great.Over all , this lopper is a joy to use . The movement is smooth and the cuts are clean.I wonder if Amazon will ever sell the replacement blade , though .	1
I do a lot of gardening and I 've owned a lot of loppers . These are the first that I 've been totally pleased with . They are super sharp and will easily cut branches up to 2 inches in diameter . I also like the way the blades are designed and the way they `` grip '' the branch . I 've been using them for 6 months now and I 've never noticed them getting stuck inside a cut . They really make your work a lot easier and even pleasurable .	1
It cuts easily through pretty large branches . It takes very little force to cut even large branches . If you have a lot of large trees ( we do ) , you will still need a pole saw and/or chain saw , but this gets the most total use.All of my garden tools are Fiskars and I am very happy with each of them .	1
I had to buy this when the trail blazer was delivered to me defective in its assembly . By leaving out a washer , the trail blazer bent out of shape when you tried to cut something over an inch . This one handles up to about 1 1/2 inch stuff just fine . It is not a ratcheting one so it might require a little more effort but it does do the job .	1
Fiskars has given me great service over the years , so while I didnt used to have brand loyalty to any particular lawn tool maker , I now buy their products when available . They 're all well made and work well , this is no exception . The gear drive is smooth and powerful , and as you might expect from a company with its roots in expensive scissors the blades are exceptional and dont need frequent sharpening . Make sure to spritz a little wd-40 or other light lube on this and any tool with moving parts before using , it 'll make them last longer , work better and prevent rust .	1
I love how powerful these are . I have cut up to 1.5 '' diameter with this ... any larger than that and I reach for a saw.My only complaint is that to get the large branches , you have to open the handles up all the way due to the power gear ( almost180 degrees apart ) . The limiting factor is cutting branches is whether I can open the handles far enough apart where I 'm working .	1
I 've had several of these from various manufacturers . I ca n't add a lot to the other reviews except to say that ( 1 ) they are very capable and surgically precise for pruning . They can handle quite large cross-sections as long as the material is not woody or hard . For example , they 're perfect for pruning back conifers to the next junction , even 1/4 in . dia . so long as the material is `` softish '' , and ( 2 ) Do not put them away in your pocket or tray or tool shelf without putting the `` sheath '' on the tip , because these are a very sharp and finely pointed weapon when locked closed . You can get a bad wound when you sit down , or crouch , or bend over if these are in a pocket unprotected.If you lose the little protective tip . use a wine bottle cork . It 's greatThat said , they 're probably my favorite , or one of my two , favorite pruners . Of many .	1
These pruners are durable , having a locking mechanism , a protective sheath , and are quite sharp ( do n't run your finger against them too hard ! ) .They make it easy do get into dense foliage , and get a perfectly angled , clean cut . Enough said .	1
These Fiskars Consumer Prod 99216935 Pruning Snips are a good cutting little garden snip . They are made from a stainless steel with good handles . Fiskars products are a quality offering and these are perfect for caring for you home or yard plants pruning and upkeep . I love them . My wife does also and now they are hers !	1
I have to say , I was a little worried that either the spring was going to go , or just something was going to happen to these perfectly priced trimmers.And after using these lil guys off n on for several months now , these things are worth thier weight in gold , I tell ya.LOL ! Comfy , sharp and easy to clean as well.Excellent price and an even BETTER deal .	1
These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants , herb garden , seasonal flowers , small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage . It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much . It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance . I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine -- -- - no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing . Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $ 8 for these I thought they were reasonable .	1
Sharp and precise pruning snips are here ! I used these pruning snips for my roses and mums . I love the spring action handle as this was a great idea . The tool is light-weight and the quality of Fiskars is one I can rely on . The size is great and easy to carry with you when you have many plants to prune . For those family members that like to borrow things and do n't bring back , I labeled my snips `` Mom '' so know one can use them without my permission as I want these back !	1
I have owned many pairs of this exact trimmer and will continue to do so . I lose them every 3-4 months . I have no idea how or why but i do . So i continue to purchase more . They are tight gripped , the spring is of high quality and will not wear after repeated long use . The shears are sharp and can get into tight spaces ( what we need it for ) . For $ 11 , this is one of the best trimmers you can buy . Enjoy and happy trimming	1
I find that the tiny tips allow me to get to right spot to snip off the pepper that I want with slicing up the surrounding leaves and stems . Nice , precise and small to fit . Much easier harvest .	1
I 'm a landscaper , so I use these snips for deadheading fussy annuals like violas and petunias.But I used to work at a Humboldt County , CA nursery , and , um ... I was probably the only person ever to buy a pair of these for legal purposes ! Seriously , this is the gold standard for pot-growers who need to do trimming . What kind of trimming ? Durn if I know , but I 've seen them at yard sales coated with the sticky sap , and the local growers used to buy stacks of these nippers with their smelly cash , so ... If you need it for either purpose , then these are the best . I 've tried other brands and did n't like them as well . Keep in mind this is for cutting thin , tiny deadheads . It 's not a pruning shear , it 's for very detailed deadheading or nipping of very small stems.If you 're doing a lot of delicate pruning like this , I 'd also recommend picking up some of those thin Atlas Nitrile Touch gloves . Best gloves for tactile sensation while doing fine work .	1
I 'm really weary of buying things that are made in China . Fiskars is located in the USA . I 'm unclear on the reason ( RICH EXECUTIVES AND GREEDY BOARD OF DIRECTORS ) why they would manufacture these snippers in China . Brings me down.Anyway . These are QUITE nice , very lightweight -- you will not be cutting anything more than thin plant material with these BUT they do reach in very nicely , nice thin blades . This operates on a naked steel wire spring , not a coiled spring , so I 'm curious how long these are going to last . Comes with a thoughtful little orange plastic cone for the business end of the snippers.These are significantly superior to bonsai-type snippers or repurposed manicure scissors . Ideal for deadheading flowers . I love garden tools and these snippers are a real treat .	1
I bought these to trim my weeds buds . Works real nice , and the are small enough to get in and get those smaller leafs .	1
We know that we should not pull beans off the vine if we want the plant to continue bearing . In the past , we have used small scissors to snip , but often the blades were too short to reach back into the plant and we were knocking off tender young buds.When I saw these snippers , I did not hesitate a moment : I bought two pair . ( Of course , I did n't want to steal all the fun of harvesting our green beans , so I bought my husband his own pair ... ) We love Fiskars products -- they are sturdy and built to last and blades are good and sharp . Blades stay sharp for a long time , then take very well to a sharpener.Regarding bonsai : This snipper is too large for bonsai work : The blades are not fine and small and exact enough.I did find another Fiskars snipper , a bit longer in the handle and the blades , that I find better for using on roses . Longer handles and longer blades keep my fingers further away from the thorns and that 's a good thing . I looked for that product here on Amazon , but did n't find it . I just mention it so you can be on the lookout . The handles are different and there is a hook on the bottom of the handles to hold them together.UPDATE July 2013 : We now have only one pair ... I used it to snip a small Japanese eggplant and one of the blades snapped right at the joint . It is very vulnerable at the joint because of the hole that is drilled in each blade where they are joined together . So , it 's still a great snipper for very delicate things , but nothing more .	1
I bought these to trim the leaves from my cannabis flowers and they work well for that . For any jobs that require more strength , get yourself something bigger/stronger.They 're not perfect , they 're not for heavy-duty cutting , and they 're made in China.But they cut . I kept a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol around to clean the trichomes off the blades periodically and had no problem getting through my entire crop . My hands were sore , but you 'll have that after trimming a pound and a half of high quality cannabis . To help ease the pain , I smoked some cannabis . Worked for me . *I am a fully RCW 69.51a compliant medical cannabis patient*	1
I 'm into bonsai and I have ( do n't tell my wife ) hundreds invested in bonsai tools . This is my go-to snipper . No it does n't get used like it would in a commercial nursery , but , hey , it 's a cheap , little , freaking scissor . I do n't gunderstand the negative posts . It does what it does and it does it VERY well . I use it a few times a week for light trimming and it 's perfect .	1
This extremely sharp tool with its long narrow blades ( and the neat safety cap that protects the blades ) has been one of the handiest tools I have used in my greenhouse and garden . I 've used it for over a year and it remains sharp and the spring action remains reliable .	1
These pruning snips are fantastic . They are super light and easy to use . The handles are comfortable and the spring action is extremely nice , even after heavy use . I really like the cases that cover the blades when they are being stored . My lefty husband and I ( right-handed ) can easily share them . I highly recommend them !	1
I love these snips for pruning and cleaning up plants in my greenhouse . The tips and blade are very sharp , so use with caution .	1
I always have this tool on me when I 'm in the yard . It 's perfect for dead heading dense flowering plant without accidentally snipping the neighboring blooms . It has a very sharp and strong blade so you can cut only using the very tip of the sheer . Because the point is so narrow and sharp , it comes with a orange rubber sheath to protect the blade while it 's in your pocket.My only gripe with this tool is the flimsy orange clasp which breaks off very easily if you are not careful . I 've owned several copies of these sheers and I 've manage to break off the clasp on all three of them by clipping branches a little larger than recommended . Fortunately , the orange sheath keeps the blades closed , assuming you do n't loose it .	1
Perfect pruners for tiny work . Very very sharp all the way to the tip . Spring loaded for easy use . Would reccomend .	1
This is my most used tool . I keep it hidden by the kitchen sliding doors so when I go to get that rose , it 's there . It 's the perfect flower cutter and comes with an orange cap to cover the blades .	1
I have never run across a Fiskars product I did not love . These small pruners are no exception . I found them ideal for pruning houseplants and shrubs ( like azaleas ) that produce small flowers and need regular deadheading . They are a perfect fit to get between stems throughout plant . Not recommended for thorny type plants , like roses . I have every fiskars tool that I have purchased or inherited .	1
Great trimmming sissors for a great price ... ..Gets right in were i needto go to trim with out getting my hands dirty and snips off cleanly..Lovem	1
These are great for fine detail snipping.I would n't use them to prune a very thick branch , but for leaf work its great .	1
Just the right size for indoor plants . Stays sharp as long as you keep it clean . It 's a good price .	1
I had to go with 4 stars because Amazon stated it was 7-inches long in the description but it 's only 6-inches . I checked the Fiskars Website and they show it correctly at approximately 6 '' in length ... but it 's exactly that length and the cutting edge is 2 '' . I have a large hand and the length does make a difference for me and I kept pushing the locking lever closed because my hand covers it and my thumb pushes the latch forward . I did trim some lilac bushes with it and it 's pretty easy to use , feels the same in either the left or right hand and is quite sharp . However , since I have about 30 more bushes to go I 'm going with the larger pairFiskars 9920 Garden Multi-Snip with Sheathand these will fit much better in my wife 's much smaller hand . If you have a small hand they you 'll likely be going with 5 stars because I ca n't find any other issue with it .	1
I bout this after my power company felled a couple trees on my property that were encroaching on power lines . They cut them into 2-3 foot sections ( and a couple 6-8 foot sections ... thanks a lot ! ) and left them where they lay . I cut them into standard 16 '' sections with a chainsaw and got to work on them ( still pretty green ) with this axe.First piece I hit was a smaller section , only about 8 inches or so thick and maybe 10 in diameter . I struck dead center on the first swing , and the halves flew apart about 6 feet , leaving me with my axe burried about 2 inches deep in my chopping stump . For the smaller length pieces like this , I only really had to let this axe fall with its own weight.On to the larger pieces ... I put the first 16 inch log , about 10 '' diameter , up on the stump and had a one-hit split on that one , too . Now , I 'm not a big guy ( 5'6 '' ) , and I have only split firewood 2 or 3 times in my life . My buddies showed me proper technique on a camping trip so I would n't cut my leg off , but that 's all the training I had . I really only planned to test the axe out on a couple pieces and save the rest for another day , but it was so much fun splitting the wood with this axe , I finished the whole lot ! Not all of them were one-strike splits , mind you , and some of the more twisted or knotty pieces gave me a little trouble . This is not a magic axe . But it got through everything , including pieces that came from where the tree bifurcated . Many of my splits ended with the axe burried in the stump I was chopping on , even after going through a nice 16 '' log . Left me sweaty and smiling.I also like to smoke meat , so I used it to chop some of the scrap-sized logs into chunks for my smoker . It worked well for this , but I think I 'm going to buy the x7 hatchet for that purpose in the future . This axe was a little too heavy and long-handled to easily take care of the smaller work . Still , I split a large box of wood chunks with it by `` choking up '' on the handle and am thrilled with the results.I would buy this again or recommend it to others in a heartbeat . I have n't truly put it through the paces yet , and I have n't had any ( major ) overstrikes , so I 'll try to remember to update this review in the future to reflect any problems or continued success with it .	1
What can I say ? I 'm no professional axe wielder , but this tool really does the job well . Strong . Balanced . Light-ish . I 'm really pleased with it .	1
I have never split firewood before . This thing works great for me so it should be tremendous for an experianced person . I did order the Fiskars sharpener and sharpened it before using . First swing I missed , after that POW ! ! a clean split every time . Used it for over an hour without a problem .	1
Now this is a real splitting axe , have never used a good splitter axe . This will splits Oak real fast and clean . The long handle is just right for power splitting . And yes I would buy it again !	1
I 've only been splitting wood for about 10 years , but in that time I 've gone through 5 axes including this one . Two were regular axes , the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed , the head on the other came off and was not repairable . Regular axes have their place , but if you 're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons , and I thought it was the best thing ever . However it weighed over 12lbs . A great muscle builder , but not quite as fun when you get older . I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes , TrueTemper . It was great that it only weighed 7lbs , and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings . After 4 seasons with that , constant resharpening , I came across the hardest Oak I 've ever seen . I was really struggling with the TrueTemper , finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece ( sometimes more ) . It was embarrassing almost , until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally . It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle , I just could n't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood , like it was nothing . I honestly could n't believe it . This axe is 6.25lbs , about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper . So I could more easily , and with slightly more speed swing it . I think the key to it 's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge . The blade edge ( long ways ) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you do n't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle ( although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right ) . Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes , that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart . The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade , so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There 's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind . I could never recommend anything other then this , because it is simply the best in all splitting situations . Other good points on it is : -corrosion resistant head steel ( although please do n't leave it outside , it will dual the edge ) -hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight , but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design , looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently . I usually do n't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening , sometimes an 1/8th . It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood .	1
My old , heavy maul frequently got stuck in the piece of wood . This one bounces out until it splits , eliminating the effort to pull it back out of the wood and getting it part way into position for the next stroke . I can also split larger pieces of wood with it .	1
Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous . But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily . I heard the trick was speed . However I found just the normal almost over the head with & # 34 ; no extra push & # 34 ; but having good control worked every time . The bade did exhibit tiny chips , but I kept it sharpened as several recommended . The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break . Although I read some had broken the handle . I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle . It did make me concentrate that much harder . I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward . I am sure each person swing is a bit different .	1
I 've cut down hundreds of trees and have split all the wood by hand . I 've been through two different mauls , and this my friends , is the best I 've used . It 's lighter , but it splits like a maul twice its weight . I just wanted to try it out when I first got it , so I took a few pieces of some hardwood into the driveway just to see how far it would go down into the wood - I never expected it to slice completely threw and still have enough energy to makes a nice chip in the concrete . All I can say is wow , I immediately went inside and ordered the 14 '' and 8 '' hatchets & fiskars sharpener . I 'm 6'4 '' and yes , the first couple of strikes I noticed the difference in the length of the handle - however if you follow proper form when splitting wood , you are in absolutely no danger of hitting your shins or feet . I quickly became accustomed to the shorter handle and because of its design , it does not require the `` windup '' and force of the longer and heavier mauls . Buy it .	1
This is a great axe . It is the perfect length and weight for my husband and me . We use the axe to split wood for our fire pit in the back yard . The axe blade is very sharp , and I have found that the Fiskars axe sharpener ( Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener ) works amazingly to resharpen the blade any time it seems to get dull . The handle fits nicely in my hand and is comfortable when splitting wood . I love this axe and recommend it to all .	1
Well balanced and comfortable . This axe does an excellent job splitting smaller to mid sized logs.Edge maintains with a lot of use.Handle seems unbreakable.A quality peice of equipment ! Another fiskars winner .	1
A great feeling splitting axe . Very comfortable in my hands and allows me to split wood easily . The overall sharpness of the blade is n't what I expected though . I expected much sharper thus the 4 star rating .	1
Amazons service was a great . Even though I used Supersaver they shipped it right out using UPS and I got it 3 days later . Thanks Amazon.Let me say in general I despise Fiskar tools and never buy them . While some are very well designed the price point demanded by all you people who buy made in China or made India lousy products at Home Depot means Fiskar has to lower the price point to where the quality is not commercial . Fiskar tools in general are not commercial and I have destroyed or worn out every Fiskar tool in short order as I have a large property and commercial orchards and timber land and my tools are heavily used especially by the 'help ' that does not have to pay for the tools.In general I stick with Gransfour Bruks ( Sweden ) , Vaughn ( USA ) , Estwing ( USA ) , Milwaukee ( USA-electric saw ) , Silky Saws /cutting hatchets ( Japan ) or the professional Grade Husqvarna chainsaws when it comes to felling timber.I took down a big ponderosa pine and was splitting it green . My near six pound maul was having problems with the big rounds as the wood was very wet . And it is a hassle to use a wedge and 8/10 pound hammer . And my 8 lb maul had a broken handle.Gransfour Bruks does not make an 8 lb maul . I checked the USA sources . No one made an 8 lb maul.I checked with Craftmans who while they do give a lifetime guarantee make their 8 lb Mauls in China now . So no 8 lb splitting mauls made in the USA anymore that I could find , if you know of one let me know . I have my old 8 pound maul head which was made by Craftsman in the USA but have to find a handle for it . Glad I saved the head now.China is gutting the USA with its currency rigging and we send them fake paper money and they send lousy products with a lot of 'cheating ' in the steel quality so fat cat Home Depot Shareholders and Fat Cat Chinese sweat shop owners is all you have and then you get a lousy axe and the `` opportunity ' to make yourself poorer and Home Depot Shareholders and the Communist Chinese richer . And a sharp , well designed long lasting tool is the safest tool.Sad to see Craftsman Tools which are nearly commercial grade go to China . People buying these cheap made in China tools at Home Depot or Sears are hurting us all and especially the people who need commercial grade tools or the 20 pc of America that is unemployed . It is unethical to buy tools made in communist china or india as they use slave labor and you 're taking a job away from an American/Canadian and china/india rigs it currency to give its manufacturers the ability to drive USA quality vendors out of business . Buy local . It is 'greener ' for this politically correct generation of MTV bra ... .er kids to buy local.I was very skeptical about the review about this axe , given my prior experience to wear out Fiskar tools in no time or have the help break them in no time , but I ordered one against my better judgement as Fiskar tools are at least made in Finland which has good protection for labor . And the Finns have a big timber cutting industry they manage well so I suspected maybe the Axe was better or the Finns would just buy the Granfours Bruks ' axes from Sweden . So the pressure was on Fiskars to come up with something world class . They surely delivered . This is a superb tool ! ! This axe is very , very well balanced and designed , as well balanced and designed as the Gransfour Bruks splitting axe or splitting maul which is saying a lot . It splits like a dream and has the same splitting ability as an 8 lb maul at a much lighter weight which really , really surprised me . So it is particularly good for older people like me that are starting to have trouble with swinging the big mauls all day . The ergonomics are perfect for a 6 foot tall man . The blade keeps its splitting edge well . Splitting a Cord of Pine is near effortless . The only problem is I do n't get the good workout anymore the splitting is so effortless . You might not even break a sweat splitting with this axe if you touch up the edge after every cord with a stone . I 'm a strong big guy and I was splitting wet 1 foot ponderosa rounds with a 3/4 raise and one arm . It Split just from the gravity fall with the dull factory edge . Truly amazing . Not even my Gransfour splitting axe does that and they shipped it with a dull edge for safety when I tried the dull edge first cut test with just a one arm 3/4 raise . This axe was truly amazing once I put a professional edge on it and got after those 30 in rounds with no problems although you do need some skill to crack a wet 30 inch round on the first go.FYI - Never ever take a splitting axe or maul behind your head . Learn to split and/or you need to get a heavier axe . I never take ad axe behind my head and have never seen professional fallers or buckers to so at least back in the days when they did not have chainsaws and people learned how to use an axe properly.I would have preferred a leather sheath but the plastic one it comes with is very clever . Plastic is not good for the environment . You can always grow more cows or wood.The only question I have is if the handle well hold up and how easy it is to replace . Fiskar steel is better than average , not as good as say Silky Saw steel or Gransfours Bruk steel which is world class , but it is as good as Estwing steel or Vaughn steel so it is great steel . This axe has a commercial grade head as far as steel quality . It is a great , great head.I gave it five stars as for the price you ca n't beat this splitting axe . For the homeowner or non professional you cant beat this splitting axe and the only shame is that Vaughn or Estwing do n't make a splitting maul or heavy splitting axe in the USA . This axe is the bomb as this generation says.The only question is how many 'years ' of hard use can you get out of the axe handle for professional splitters . But you could buy 4 of these for the price of the Gransfour maul and this splits better although Gransfours wo n't like to hear that . The Granfours of course last several generations the steel quality is so good so if you do n't want to have your kids buy tools go with Granfours axes and maul if you can afford them . I inherited my grandfathers gransfour axes and I am an old man now and they still cut/split like they were new.Given what is available in the market for high quality 6-8 pound mauls not made in China or India or the third world this splitting axe is the best choice for the home owner with a lot of wood to split especially big rounds . It really cracks those big rounds I was using a estwing wedge and 8/10 lb Vaughn sledge to break.Looks like they are selling enough of these I can get a new handle if it breaks and the handle is under warranty but I always misplace receipts . I 'm going to put some coffee can tin underneath the head to extend the life of the handle as the head is a 'perfect ' design . They should give a raise to the engineer who designed this axe . I will buy a few more of these.In summary a superbly designed axe with capability to split equal to a good usa made 8 lb maul with near commercial quality ex for the handle and lack of a leather sheath . For the price you ca n't beat this tool and its made in Finland where the government respects labor and not China or India nations looking to gut and steal USA and Canadian jobs by rigging their currency and employing child labor.Too bad about the cheap looking plastic sheath . A leather sheath and a commercial grade handle of top quality hickory would make this a forever tool and I would gladly pay $ 75 dollars or more to get the upgrade to the commercial handle and a good sheath . Gransfour is on the run with this axe at last . Heck I would pay 125 dollars for his head on a commercial grade handle it is that good.Thanks Fiskar . Thanks for providing us with an ethical buying choice and such a superb design . Fix your other tool lines and I will be a buyer . This makes up for all the other Fiskar tools I wore out or the help broke . So Fiskar owed me as I do n't take back tools I wear out . That is my job to be a buyer and pay a fair price for high quality.This axe has HIGH QUALITY although its is nothing to look at as far as aesthetics . Only Gransfour makes beautiful axes anymore .	1
This is the first Axe I have ever owned . ( Not the first axe I have ever used . ) I am very pleased with it . At first the head seemed to make the axe feel off balance and heavy , but as I got to using it , it helped get momentum building to make splitting the wood almost effortless .	1
I have never picked up an axe in my life but in a few hours I split over a cord of wood . This axe is incredible . If you are on the fence , do n't be ! Buy this axe now ! ! !	1
If you & # 8217 ; re looking for a well made axe and you don & # 8217 ; t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy ! I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I & # 8217 ; ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out ! Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made , but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn & # 8217 ; t seem the worse for wear , just some nice scars . Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter . EXCELLENT PRODUCT !	1
Had a tree cut down in the spring . Picked this guy up to make some firewood for the summer . It is comfortable in the hands and splits wood as if it was a mellon . I 've even used it to cut down some Honeysuckle and a small tree . No problems what so ever . The product was shipped on time and packaged well .	1
I bought the 36 inch Fiskars Splitting Axe based on the great reviews of it here early in the Spring of 2013 . I like the long handle and it works good for someone of my height ( 6 feet ) . I can say this wood splitter has been as good as people say it is and is by far the best wood splitter I have owned . I used to go though a wood handle on my old wood splitter every year because of wear and tear with an occasional miss of my target . This wood splitter is far lighter and far more durable . I have cut about 4 cords of wood with it so far and am very pleased with how it works.As many others point out , you will need to keep this sharp for it to work correctly , and I recommend getting the Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener along with this . I sharpen it every hour or two of good use . If I notice the wood is n't splitting well , I sharpen it again ( it is easy to loose track of time when splitting wood ) . I keep the cover on it at all times when not in use as this is not something you want to fall on anything accidentally.I want to thank everyone here for their insightful reviews , which got me to buy this and to Fiskers for making such a great product . I have been splitting wood for about 10 years now and I only wish I knew about this product when I first started . I can not recommend this product enough !	1
After splitting hundreds of cords of firewood , this is the best splitting maul that I 've used . The hollow handle cuts down on the weight and the efficient design of the wedge make splitting wood much easier . I was able to split 3-foot cedar rounds relatively easily after failing to be able to with my old splitting maul . I use the 36 inch handle , but sometimes choke up a bit to get more force . This is an excellent design that allows you to split wood more quickly with less effort .	1
This is an item I purchased based on reviews . I barely looked at any other splitting axes.The reviewers were right.I am new to splitting , but watched some videos to learn . This is a solid axe , yet the lightweight handle gives a great balance and reduces fatigue versus heavier , wood versions . I have a lot of Fiskars tools so I know their plastic-composite is incredibly strong . They also have a great warranty.In short , if you use this axe how you are supposed to , you will not have a problem splitting logs .	1
With a yard full of cut oak and a 20-year-old axe , progress was slow until this dimwit figured out he needed a new axe . After a little bit of research I decided on the Fiskars X27 with the longer handle . After several days of chopping wood I am a believer . The axe arrived in a timely manner with a sharp edge burrowed safely in the protective , snug fitting head cover.Some of the oak sections left for me are 17-20 inches in diameter , an impossibility for my old axe . With the Fiskars I made quick work of a 17 & # 34 ; piece and an 11 & # 34 ; log today . In fact with three hits I was able to split the larger log right down the middle . For other pieces instead of hitting in the middle I chopped pieces off of the edges until the log was small enough to split in the middle.I like this new axe quite a bit . It 's sturdy , nicely designed aesthetically , and cuts like nothing I 've ever used before without needing the strength of Hercules . The Fiskars is just a little longer than my old axe and is just the right length for this 5 foot 10 inche amateur lumberjack . Occasionally I forgot about those few extra inches of length and hit my target with the axe handle . Eventually I learned to stand back just a little further.At first I wondered if any product could live up to so many positive affirmations . This axe does and for me is well worth the money .	1
This Super Splitting axe does exactly what it 's supposed to do . The handle is unbreakable . Really . It has very good balance . Perfect weight . The shape of the handle fits the hand well , and the curve at the end of the handle makes gripping it easier . It 's very well designed . It 's the favorite of all the guys on the Arborist site . Great tool Great price on Amazon .	1
Best combination maul/axe I have found.Sharp , lifetime guarantee , great ergonomics.Another Fiskars product that is well worth the money.Stlii made in Nordic Country , the quality and innovation shows.I like the Teflon coating a lot , no more prying out a stuck maul , it is so well balanced , it is fun again to Chop Wood !	1
I wrote reviews on my other Fiskars products and this one is King of them All . I love this axe . With this woodsplitting axe you will not want to own any other splitter . This baby smashes through logs with one medium force swing . The logs explode . I could n't believe how much wood I split the first day I had this axe . It comes with a great head cover , the axe is light and I think the handle is indestructible . Best money you will ever spend on an axe , especially for wood splitting . No wedges required .	1
I got this to cut wood for camping and a backyard fire pit . It 's a great axe and the weight is about perfect . I cut oak , hackberry , and mesquite .	1
One of my many home defense weapons . Not sure if I would grab this first but it could be fun .	1
+ Does n't leak+ Simple design+ Easy to connect/disconnect- A bit priceyOverall , very happy , these are nice ! I hope they last in the weather/sun .	1
Unfortunately nothing beats gardena . They kepp tight even after years and years of usage . connect as well as disconnect easy.My parents have some that are at least 20 years old and still fine.I am not sure how many attachments are available in the US but in Europe , this is the Rolls Royce of water hoses . You can get sprnklers , waterguns whatever you can imagine ... .and of course they are REALLY expensive ... ..well , you get what you pay for.Before I forget , one thing that makes these connectors so great . Once you disconnect the water stops ! No dripping and when you connect the & # 34 ; hot & # 34 ; hose ... you will not get drenched ... ... If I was unclear pls ask , I will answer if I can	1
These use universal metric/US hose connector sizes that should fit either or ( I 'm using them on US sized threads ) . I bought two sets of these to go on various hoses , pressure washer , sprayers , sprinklers , virtually every watering device and hose I have has these connected on it . It makes it incredibly simple to switch devices on the hose without having to shut off the water . For the past 6 months I have heavily used all of them and none have leaked at the quick connector or the screw fittings ! You can pick up a set of o-ring from harbor freight or buy the proper ones from Gardena to replace the quick connectors if they fail ( have n't had any issues yet ) . You can also try to oil them to bring them back to life , especially if you 've left it out over winter.These seem really durable . I have had these on hoses and sprayers that have dropped on pavement and not broken off . I 've had several cheaper hose fittings that either started leaking within the first year or broke apart the first time they touched pavement . I expect these to last many years without needing replacement.Had a slight issue when I ordered one of the packages was missing one of the female quick connect fittings from the box - Amazon quickly replaced though . Otherwise these are quality connectors that I will continue to stick with Gardena from now on .	1
These are easy to use and perform well as expected . Delivery was fast and the contents were unharmed . The price is higher than comparable products but that is the case with all Gardena items . Worth the extra cost .	1
I was certain this product would leak but I have had it hooked up to water under pressure for some time now and have not noticed a single drip . I will add more to other quick connect purposes .	1
Hello . My name is Momster and I am a gadget lover . Oh , I am also lazy ... I got sick and tired of screwing and unscrewing my garden hoses whenever I wanted to swap from nozzle to sprinkler . Much to my delight , I found these years ago when buying a new sprinkler ( a Gardena ) and have n't been able to do without these since.I have a two-way connector attached to my spigot with a QC ( Quick Connector ) , one side goes to our auto-timer that runs the sprinkler ( told you I was a lazy gadget lover ! ! ) , and one to the regular cleaning/tasking hose . On the end of my tasking hose is another QC so I can slap on another sprinkler or nozzle with very little effort . Because I have a QC on the spigot as well , I can easily change hose configuration without breaking my back because I 'd have to bend over AND twist around to access that one.NOTE : Because these are made of plastic , they do have a limited life - especially if you leave them out all year long . ( Been there , done that . ) The summer sun and winter freeze will cause the pieces to crack sometimes , so be sure to check them before you use them at the start of the season.Part of the fun is figuring out which pieces should go to what . Have fun with that . But honestly , once you get everything figured out , you 'll wonder why in the world you struggled so long without them ... especially as you get older ... .it 's no fun playing Twister to get at the spigot .	1
I much prefer snap connectors thought they tend to be overpriced . Gardena is my favorite brand . I usually remove the autostop valve inside .	1
This is great ! Sure beats screwing and unscrewing hoses & attachments . One came with the Gardena Sprikler that I odered and I liked it so much that I ordered the Starter Set for all my other attachments . Now I just plug and unplug .	1
I wanted a patio box to reduce the clutter of watering cans , garden supplies , and other odds and ends that sat on my patio . This one is perfect ! It 's a great size , not too big , is sturdy , and was a breeze to assemble ( no tools needed ) . Very happy with this purchase .	1
I have 2 of these . One is a year old and I just ordered a 2nd . They work great to keep things dry and make my yard look less cluttered with stuff .	1
I put this together in about 5 minutes and it 's sitting on my back porch right now . It 's strong enough for a 200lb person to sit on comfortably and it 's roomy enough inside for all my pool equipment , pool toys , and other miscellaneous things that were sitting around making a mess . The porch looks great now without all of the clutter ! I 'm thinking of buying a second one since I liked this one so much .	1
The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions . Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width , length and height . Not saying the info is deceptive , just not as clear as it might be ! I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18 & # 34 ; . I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid ... which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I did n't plan to sit on it anyway .	1
I ordered 2 of these , we really like them . They are well made and I think they will last a long time outside holding our misc . items ( water hoses ; electric cords ; pool vacuum ; etc. ) . I do n't think they are strong enough to use as a seat , but , we do n't need them for that .	1
I am very happy with this deck box . It is very roomy . I keep all my garden supplies there . It was very easy to install , just 5 min , snap all the parts and it is ready to use . It is sturdy too . We sit on it and it holds me , my husband and my 3 years old with no problems . I actually store there some vegetables and fruits , like potato and apples , when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals wo n't get it . It nicely blends with my white walls of the house .	1
This is the second of theses reels I have purchased . The first one broke after much use due to the stress and a heavy hose I had installed . This time I purchased a much lighter weight hose and it works great .	1
This stovetop smoker is amazing . We currently own theChar Broil Silver Smokerand it take 5+ hours to smoke fish and meats . The stovetop smoker can achieve the same results in about 30-40 minutes . I love using different varietities of the smoking chips and foods come out tender , juicy and full of flavor . Clean up is simple since I use foil to line the bottom of the drip pan . All I have to do is toss out the smoking chips ashes , peel back the aluminum foil , give it a quick wash and rinse to get any moisture or any food splatter on the lid and store it until the next use . This unit does not fill your house with smoke but you can smell the wonderful aroma of cedar , apple , mesquite or whatever flavor of chips you use.Since I have a smooth top stove and do not want to scratch the surface , I use the stovetop smoker on top ofSanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill , Blackand also use it on with myWeber 586002 Q 320 Portable Outdoor Gas Grill . Using it on the Weber Grill gets slower cooking results but it is great to take to picnics and camping to smoke up those fish you catch !	1
This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used ( and I use it often ) . I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now . It is as good as the day I bought it . I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker ( just not as much in terms of amount ) . It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price . You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking . I would highly recommend this product . The best wood to use is hickory ( it is the all around best for all types of meats ) . The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry . It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat . If anything happens to this smoker , I will certainly buy another one . This product is one that lasts and lasts !	1
I have NEVER used this product after purchasing two or three years ago . Other reviewers seemed to like it so I gave it five stars . I have packed it away somewhere and will give it away to anyone who wants it .	1
pick a flavor of smoke , get some of Cameron 's wood dust in that flavor and get ready to smoke stovetop style , any season . just great flavor .	1
I lived in a condo for years and really missed cooking outdoors and the tremendous flavor of food slow smoked in a smoker . I bought this awhile ago and have been pretty happy with it . It 's stainless steel , durable and comes with samples of 4 different types of wood chips . You can buy more from Cameron international or Amazon.com . I use it all the time and never have any problems with smoke filling up the kitchen and the smoke detector never goes off . It 's a closed unit so virtually all of the smoke stays inside . If there is a problem with smoke escaping , the instructions include tips on how to correct the problem . Usually , the lid just needs a little tweaking.I think the first thing I smoked in it was salmon and let me tell you it was delicious ! I have also smoked chicken , turkey wings , sweet potatoes , potatoes , shrimp , burgers , and cheese all with excellent results . I put the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes to shorten the cooking time . The chicken does n't brown as in a traditional outdoor smoker or grill but you can finish cooking it in the oven to brown it . If it 's smoke flavor you are after , this is a very good alternative to outdoor smoking ! Cleaning the smoker is a breeze if you first spray the rack with cooking spray . Also if you line the base of the smoker and the drip pan with aluminum foil all you have to do is let it cool completely and dump the foil in the trash . This will help to keep your pans from getting black and shortens clean up time .	1
I just tried my stovetop smoker and was amazed at the results . I 've used a large outdoor smoker for years , and was skeptical about the stovetop smoker . I used it to prepare chicken breasts , and they cooked fast and were juicy and tender , and had just the right amount of smoke flavor . I 'm looking forward to using my stovetop smoker for seafood and vegetables . It 's a great way to add flavor to food , and a very healthy way to cook.The smoker is constructed from heavy steel and is well made . I could smell the smoke as the food cooked , but it was n't intense and there was no smoke in the house . I 'll still use my outdoor smoker for batch cooking or for smoking large birds , but expect to get a lot of use out of the stovetop smoker .	1
Used once and really like it . I smoked whole chicken , but I cut chicken in half and smoked about 1.5 hours on lower heat . The chips birned , so next time I would add more chips . I did have to finish chicket ( to add some crispiness ) in the oven for 10 min . The chicken came out excellent , best chicken I ever cooked . With chicken smoked potato and came out very nice as well with delicate flavor of smoke . Also , I considered as a bonus the aroma of smoked wood that fill out my house , loved it . It was not strong , but flavorful . Highly recommend this product .	1
I 've had this grill for about two months now and I love it . It 's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black , rectilinear grill . This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great . Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking , the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish , steaks or skewered items . For sandwich-style grilling ( e.g. , hamburgers , hotdogs , etc . ) you can cook for twice that many . The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well ; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food , while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on . The Patio Caddie comes with hickory-scented briquettes that enhance the flavor and mask the gas scent.Be sure to consider the Patio Caddie if you 're in the market for a high quality gas grill in this price range . You ca n't go wrong !	1
I 've owned the Char-Broil Patio Caddie for quite a few years and I am currently on my 2nd grill . For those looking for a compact grill to use on a small patio or balcony , I believe that this is the best grill that you 'll find.I 'm not sure if the other reviews mention this or not , but this grill does accept a full-size propane cannister , so you can just swap it out at your local drug or hardware store when it 's empty . My grill did come with the smaller cannister , but I bought it quite awhile ago , so perhaps they no longer do . If yours does n't , it 's no great loss , in my view , because once again , I 've never used the smaller cannister . Just get yourself a full-sized one and it will last a lot longer.The temperature gauge seems very accurate and the grill is quite durable . I figure that this grill should last you about 5-6 years , with regular use . I 'd definitely recommend it and I 'd also suggest buying the cover to keep it looking nice on the outside as well .	1
This is a perfect grill for small groups . I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect . It was n't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent , everything fit together very well . I have only 2 problems with this grill . First , the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid . Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly . Not a problem , I 'll just take the hangers off as they do n't work that well anyway . Second , I grilled on it 2 days ago , on a fairly calm day weather wise . For some reason the flame kept going out . Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks , should have only taken 20 minutes . Not sure what causes this problem as I have n't ready anyone else experiencing it . It 's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars .	1
I bought this a replacement for one exactly like it . The old one finally was put to rest after many years of use by my parents . This compact grill is easy to use and uses up very little space . Perfect for a small deck . Great construction and easy set up . The one drawback was that the new grill did not come with the two side tables that the original grill had . I took them off the old grill and installed them on the new one .	1
By far , the most effective pest control for Yellowjackets I 've ever come across . How effective you ask ? We had a major Yellowjacket problem and I went to 4 stores ... all of which were out of this trap . At each store , there was at least 1 person ( one place had 3 ) looking around for the traps because of the yellowjacket problems in this area . Finally the 5th place I stopped had just restocked and their shelves were full ... and yes , there were 2 people already picking them up when I arrived.Come home , put the solution on the cotton ball and by the end of the first 12 hours , we had caught 13 yellowjackets . I come home tonight from work and we are now up to 25 yellowjackets this device has captured in under 24 hours ! Now those are measurable results ! EDIT : I just added a photo ... over 40 yellow jackets trapped in just 3 days !	1
Great and effective product for YJ 's only . No food attracts hornets and really foul smelly stuff attracts flies , but this is great for YJ 's . Other wasps and hornets are attracted to the activity but they like fresh meat/bugs . Fly catchers ( stinky bags ) attract hornets and wasps to the live bugs . I have used these for many years . Use these units with the larger 10 week cartridge , and place the small pack bait ( available at Amazon ) on it when it gets weak , reuse with this type of cheaper bait in the larger cartridge each year , but check that there are no webs covering the bottom holes and/or internal cone hole , or YJ 's will leave . It works very well to catch queens looking to build nests in April , and keep them out until Sept. to get workers of queens that were missed . Very effective . Move to another location if no luck in 2 weeks , or if very few are caught . Load indoors or after sunset , or you might get stung . Hint , this old fish smell works well in the spring , sweet attractant works better before hybernation in the fall in a different type of catcher ; one you can put juice , beer , or other sweet attractant , with a drop of soap , recharge with water but add a drop of non-fragrant dish soap as it evaporates .	1
Does not seem to actually capture YJ 's , but their annoying buzzing stopped when I put one of these about 20 ' outside of my veggie garden . Somehow it seems to work . YJ 's , hornets , were making nests in the GROUND , in dying roots from pine trees which I had cut down YEARS ago ... the roots seem to never completely rot , but leave a hollow which apparently invites these guys . And they are protective of their nest area.I use the stuff which comes with the trap , nothing fancy like apple juice and peanut butter.I bought a 2nd one this year for near an apple tree where these guys get their sips from fallen apples or apples which the birds have started to pick on . Hope it works there too.Recommend .	1
Never enough around , re-ordered product ; easy to use though this current model is missing the hanging string . Works well for 30-45 days until the scent diminishes . It is an effective product .	1
Washed out my 'old ' trap that I have been using for several years , placed a 'new ' cartridge in the trap and had begun capturing wasps or yellow jackets by the next morning . Keeps my backyard free of the pests ...	1
Very effective , I am able to keep my garden and yard relatively yellow jacket free and I can enjoy sting free outdoors .	1
This attractant works excellent for YJ 's and I have been using Recue successfully for several years . Easy to place and reusable units and these cartridges can be easily resused by adding liguid from the less expensive plastic refills . However , I believe these cartridges last longer and are a better value . Great price at Amazon . Must be used in the effective Rescue canisters . They really work great ! ! Highly recommend !

I put up 2 of these . One was about 20 ' from an apple tree which the yj 's just love . Had no problem until the end of the season , I 'm guessing that that 's when the 10 weeks supply ran out . I put a 2nd near my veg garden and about 15 ' form old tree roots which the yj 's also find irresistible . No problem there either this year.Would buy again .	1
Last year was a horrible YJ year here in Northwest Montana . Although I caught hundreds daily in July with homemade traps ( mason jar with soapy water and meat dangling over it ) - this year I set the non disposable Rescue traps out in mid-April after 2 YJ in the house . I was prepared to try to catch queens early and hopefully have a better summer - typically bugs of any kind are not an issue here.When I bought the non disposable , I also bought these and these are not only lots more convenient but I 've been getting 50-75 in each in several days vs 15-20 in the non disposable . Our weather typically is a string of warm , sunny days followed by cool & cloudy so at the onset of warm and sunny , I set out fresh traps.I have 8 acres of wooded property but am setting traps only in my yard area - maybe slightly less than 1 acre . I did n't expect to catch so many this early . I hope it helps.Now - in my area , they seem to do best in the sun . It is nearly 80 today but most warm days have been 65-70 . I have 2 or 3 of a mix of disposable and non-disposable hung in 5 places from 20-40 feet away from my house.I 'm using water in the traps , not apple juice.FWIW , I did try adding some of my mason jar meat traps and there was no interest in those at this point . Also , previous years , I 've caught wasps and hornets in beer . Beer did not work last year or this for the YJs . I also tried Hawaiian Punch last year - no , they liked my chicken leg bones with a bit of bbq sauce . Crazy . But , these are working for me this year , I am just astonished at the volume considering we had 3 periods of sustained below zero temps over the winter .	1
I 'm allergic to the buzzy creatures and have to carry an epi-pen . Lots of them favor the nooks and crannies of our 120 year old log cabin up in the Rockies . I 've tried everything they sell and we try to avoid chemical poisons . This really works and works fast . Use as directed and start early spring to head off those & # 34 ; queens & # 34 ; We have cut back the problems by 75 % since we began to use it a couple of years ago	1
I hung this trap about 20 feet from an underground yellow jacket nest . For the first few days , not many yellow jackets were trapped , I was not impressed . I went out and shook it up a bit , making sure that the attractant was properly dissolved in the water . Next time I checked , this thing was FULL of stinging insects , yellow jackets and a few hornets . There are still some yellow jackets around my deck , but a lot fewer . We can now sit out there without fear of being stung . This first trap was a test drive , I am now ready to purchase more of these things . Would like to purchase another three , but Amazon only has ONE in stock ! Bummer . At least I know that they are not a waste of money . I do worry about the bee population , but I can not have them so close to my house . My kid is being stung , we can not enjoy our deck . The bees have to move outta town !	1
I 'm updating my last review where I said it did n't work . I 've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies . I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I did n't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain , and very high wind pretty well ! I thought it was gon na be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it . The winds reached at least 90MPH . So do n't worry if you get a bad storm . As long as you have it tied up good it should stay .	1
beware -- do NOT have in enclosed spaces ... .even just walking by it makes me want to gag ! ! but the flies love it . they have such bad taste	1
. . .whether they 're being attracted for a mile radius . I did n't think I had a big fly problem . We had a few flies . We 're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii , not a horse farm or overly near a public park . Still , the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW , this trap works . It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown . During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree , no flies came into the house . I 'll take a break for a week , then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW , take two , I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught . Ick .	1
We had a fly problem a few years ago , so I tried these traps . I was very impressed with the sheer number of flies it caught ( my wife was just disgusted ) . This year we had a bigger infestation , so I tried theRescue Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant # FTA-SF4and they were nearly ineffective . I purchased a few more of these disposable traps and they 're amazing at attracting and catching flies . The smell , however , is quite bad and is almost more offensive than a few rogue flies.The major advantage of this type of trap is that it works in the daytime , when flies are active , unlike an electronic trap like theFlowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer ( One Acre Coverage ) ( which I also purchased ) .The irony , I found , in having such effective attractants is that you get more flies . I moved my traps to the far side of the yard , away from the house , and suddenly we have fewer flies trying to sneak in the side door . ( Obvious ? )	1
They stink like an old outhouse but work great trapping fly 's and hornets ; the hornets go in to catch a fly or maggot and ca n't get out . There is usually a sentry hornet that hangs out at the opening , and tries to get fly 's from outside the bag , or , goes in after them . Once that hornet is gone , another arrives . Hornets want live bait.Warning : Do not use indoors ! ! If you fill it in the kitchen or inside your house , do not spill any in the sink , floor , trash , or your hands , as it really reeks , as it is supposed to to attract fly 's , like to an outhouse . Some bags do leak from manufacturing defects . Yuck ! ! It does not wash off easily . Do not use warm or hot water in the bags as you will dissolve the smelly contents too quickly and not attract fly 's to the heat . Once hung , refill it , regularly only to the line ( it gives them space to crawl in and get stuck inside ) , and towards the end of the season add some apple-juice to attract more flys and hornets , and yellow jackets . Adding a drop of dish detergent helps them drown quickly , and to sink to the bottom . If you fill it too full , or the dead fly 's stack up , the others will crawl out easily . Keep a space between the yellow plastic and the fly 's and water . Once full of fly 's just unhook it and set it on the ground to dry out then toss the whole bag ; it will stink . Be sure once you have opened it that the yellow top seals in the open position from the weight so fly 's do not crawl back out . Be careful not to get stung while refilling if a stinger creature is close ; you encroach on their hunting territory.These have worked well for me and I prefer The Big Bag model . Highly recommended ! ! These can stink up an eating , playing , or relaxing area but gets flies like crazy , and some hornets and YJ 's . My wife can not stand the smell so I get the job .	1
I ca n't fathom a fly catching product working any better . We experienced a few flies in the house this Spring so we purchased this product . In less than one week , this product caught over two hundred flies . What is kind of funny is that this product attracts flies to it ... who knew there were that many flies around my house . While the product captures many flies , it also attracts them . Flies that were not necessarily a problem were captured . Day one a few flies are trapped , and each subsequent day -- - by the fifth day , the amount of flies caught was unimaginable . I am going to rid the entire neighborhood of flies at this rate . I am going to stockpile this product .	1
This fly trap catches a lot of flies and so far we ca n't smell anything from it . It is hanging outside suspended on a string tied to our garage . Perhaps its because of our trade wind weather ... but so far no smell and it has been hanging out for a week . It 's actually fun to see all those trap flies inside .	1
I 've been using this brand of fly trap for about 5 years now and it 's never disappointed me . It will catch all the nasty types of flies you normally find during the summer time . This is perfect for pet owners like myself , in case the dog dumps its love bundles and I do n't see it , which can atrack flies.A couple of things you should know about this product : First , it will probably not catch any flies the first day , and let me explain why , the material in the trap and water that you add need to mix for about a day , at which type , a very strong smell will start to come out of the trap , which means it is now working . After the first day , and during the hot ones , trust me , it will be gross , yet amazing thing what this trap can do.Second , you have to constantly add water to the level indicated on the bag , specially during the hot days and if the trap is under direct sun light . This is easy to do with a paper cup or any other small cup.Third , when hanging it , place it away from your doors and windows , or be ready for some nasty smells . The trap has a mixture of eggs ( dried ) and other products to create a strong odor that flies ca n't resist.In conclusion , this product DOES NOT USE chemicals at all , it is all natural and catches a great number of fly species ; it wo n't let you down . It works .	1
I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears . I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents , none of which ever worked . I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100 % , not even 50 % effective . So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem . I then searched Amazon , my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap . I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house . Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously . I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys , you should too .	1
These things work great ! Make sure you follow the directions to open/set it up , then fill it with water and hang someplace out of the way where the flies collect . I 've hung ours about 50 feet from our patio , under a pine tree where we have a quail block feeding the birds . Lots of flies gather round there , and these traps fill up quickly . Nary a fly makes it to our patio , even when we have our meals out there . Before the fly trap , we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio . So glad I found these ! Only downfall , they are a little stinky , I can smell it when I walk by about 8 feet away , but since it 's not close to our 'living space ' , it 's no problem .	1
The only thing wrong with my order is that I did not order more ! The trap was working within 30 minutes of setting it up.I want to thank the reviewer who said he had an issue with cutting the plastic at the top of the trap . Had I not read his review I would have had the same issue . I avoided it by using an exacto type cutting tool to cut the circle out.When setting it up I did spill some of the attractant on the side of the trap . The flies were all over it within 15 minutes and 30 minutes later they were in the trap . Be sure to hang this trap up of the reach of pets . This trap not only attracts flies it also attracts dogs too . Never underestimate the intelligence and leaping ability of a miniature dachshund . She immediately found where I had spilled it on the ground and soon figured out the source . I distracted her , hung it higher , and washed away what spilled on the ground . I mention this only because we mini dachshund owners tend to be very protective of our little heart stealing dogs.A possible mistake I made when setting this out was to hang it in direct sunlight . We have a heat wave at this time and during the hottest part of the day I did not see any flies around the unit . Today I am going to hang it in a shade tree . I 'm sure that will work and if it does not I will update this review within a short period of time.I feel that this trap is well worth what I paid for it and as soon as I am done with this review I am going to order at least one more maybe two . One for the front yard and one for the back . I have a fly problem because I have fruit trees , compost piles , a garden , and I live in a tiny town surrounded by farms . The flies in the front yard are a bad problem because when I mow the yard they come out and pester me when I am trying to concentrate on safely mowing the part of my yard where it has steep slopes . You can easily turn your mower over while trying to swat a biting fly . If the yard does not get mowed I wind up with thousands of mosquitoes and dozens of snakes.All in all I am happy with this purchase and I wish I had found this item many years sooner.UPDATE . JULY 28,2011.I 'm glad I ordered more . My trap is already full . One more thing I need to mention . Do n't hang the bag too close to where you sit or eat outside . The bag has an odor and without that odor the trap will not work . I would experiment by hanging it in different locations . The perfect spot would be close enough to attract flies away from you but far enough that you do n't smell it . It also helps to remove things that attract flies away from the trap . Mine hangs in a fruit tree . I had some rotten fruit on the ground that was attracting the flies more than the trap . I raked them up and got rid of them . The next day the flies were swarming the trap even more than they had been .	1
I put these by the chicken coop , the edge of the property that is past our pool , and another past the fenceline that is closest to our deck . Draws flies like crazy . Ca n't have close to the house because it 's pretty stinky ! All you do is add some water and hang the bag out..let it get full and toss it .	1
This is a great product but I think the price is a mistake ( 94.00 ) I got mine at some local store for less than 10 bucks . I just put one up a few days ago and it is filled ( I have chickens ) with flies . Really works well I keep one by the coop and another by the house . I am going to get more it is really too full . The best part you just chuck it when you 're done with it .	1
I am an ISA Certified Arborist , so I can tell you , as a professional , that this product beats all other similar products out there , hands down . I use mine on the job just about everyday , and it stands up to pretty tough use . It does go through webbing straps every now and then , but restringing new straps is easy , once you get used to it . Customer Support at Fiskars is second to none . They have replaced , at no charge , numerous webbing straps , the extension tube and a cutting head . Rest assured , unless you are a professional out there , you will probably never have to change out anything on your unit . If you ever have to though , I can assure you that Fiskars will be there to help you out , via their toll-free number and quick e-mail response team . I recommend this unit and its smaller brother . Both go into the trees with me , sixty feet and higher , and both give reliable service .	1
I 'm pleased with this . I 'm 66 years old and a cancer survivor so do n't have the saying power of some people . Have found this very easy to use . It is a little heavy for me when fully extended but not so bad I ca n't use it . One thing I learned is to adjust the head so I make square cuts to avoid any hang up from the branch starting to fall and binding the blades . Used this to trim limbs over my electric pasture fence while driving my tractor so my Tractor ROPS bar now clears the limbs . If the jaws fit around a limb you can cut it without a terrible amount of strength . I bought this to trim some tall hedge bushes along the edge of my yard and it worked well for trimming the tall tops . Have used the saw ( 3 inch limbs ) and it cuts fine if you let it do the cutting and take your time . Used it to cut some woody stemed large weeds on hard to navigate banks too . Over all a very handy tool .	1
In the $ 80 range with no shipping or tax , this is worth the money if you need to prune tree branches on a regular basis as I do . My husband loves it and thinks the construction is superior . Unfortunately , I have difficulty working it . He 's 65 , and I 'm 59 and do n't have the arm strength/length nor the the height ( 5 ' 3 '' and under are going to have trouble ) to work it properly when it needs to be fully extended . Any man should have no difficulty , and it will pay for itself the first time you use it versus hiring someone to prune for you.August 30 , 2007 update : Since December 2006 when I bought this , I have been forced to use this more because my husband has been unavailable due to his golfing addiction . In spite of my shortness , this tool works fine for me as long as the trunk of what you are cutting is n't more than one and one-half inch in diameter . However , there is a saw attachment which will allow you to get through the thicker branches . Over time , this tool has become indispensable to me , especially since I have six redwood trees , numerous other treees , and tons of high bushes.August 16 , 2011 : Fiskars has terrific customer service . After almost five years of heavy use , a plastic clamp that holds the extension , broke . Know that Fiskars honors a limited lifetime warranty on this item . I had to send them a copy of my Amazon receipt and a picture of the damage ( picture can not exceed 2 megabytes ) . Full instructions on how to make a warranty claim are included on Fiskars ' website , plus their telephone customer service is excellent . They sent me a new part plus a link to complete instructions , including pictures , for disassembling the pruner and replacing the part . My husband was able to effect the repair . There was no dollar cost to me at all , and this is way better than having to buy another one for $ 80.May 28 , 2014 : I still use this pruner regularly , and it continues to work well after the repair . The only problem is that you do have to watch the thickness of the branches you are cutting because this pruner will only tolerate so much .	1
Purchased this item at 11 AM . Used free supersaver shipping . Received the next day . Unreal . Apparently these are stocked in local warehouses . I live in a small Ohio city . The tracking number immediately showed a UPS exception . This was a first . The product itself is nice . Well made . Easy to use . Some commented on the shipping carton . It was a long box , with 2 separate box pieces taped together . The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged . It was fine . I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in . The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage . The box is so odd shaped that nothing else will be piled on top . This will be a useful product . Added : Minor dissapointment . Just saw this in my big box grocery store for $ 69.00-full price . This is a full price store-not a discounter .	1
excellent product , already done with winterizing trimming around the house , when I first pulled the cutting bowel and branch fell down , my wife instantly said `` magic '' , that 's how I felt , too . But then moving on to larger branch and switching to cutting saw and that 's when problems occured , first the wing nut which were used to tighten and positioned the saw were being knocked off by the tree because of the push and pull motion ; which un-screw the wing nut , went down and look for it , after finding it and tightening it up super tight , back to work and the extension poll fell out also caused by the push and pull motion , pick it up , slided it back in , tightening it up and figured out how the rope and jaw reacts to each other and did some adjustments , and it works fine ever since , I 'd give it a 5 star if not because it took me 30 minutes to find things and fixed and adjusted it the first time I 've used it , other than that , it 's a great helper to make things possible .	1
This is a nice , light weight tool for trimming small branches high in trees and shrubs . It easily cuts branches up to 1/2 inch . The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is my experience with other Fiskars ' tools with the same type of adjustable head . The head is a weak point , after a few months of use my experience is that the plastic head will fail . Even though it has a lifetime warranty ; returning for repairs is just too difficult to be worth the trouble .	1
After it arrived , I went right out and trimmed a few trees . Amazing how easy it was to use and how effective it was .	1
Each time I cook with my grille , I use this around my waist and have all my utensils handy and ready to go , what I did was just hang it upon my belt and it works great , unless you use suspenders or do n't wear pants .	1

I bought this to retrofit it on my Genesis platinum series 2 gas grill . The reason why is that the factory installed tool hooks prevent you from opening the lower grill doors with tools hanging from the hooks . These are stainless steel and I have figured out how to do this so I am going to relocate them to the side of the work table on the grill . They will work and last with a little customization .	1
Clips right onto the rim of the lower kettle half , well-made , really handy , you NEED one of these ! Possibly TWO of these ! ! !	1
Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill ( One-Touch Silver ) and some new Weber tools , I needed something to hold them . I did n't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills , so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now , I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they could n't get their lid to close , or that the tool holder would fall off . Well , it does n't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers . This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill ( except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum , since it has everything you need ) . It is very easy to use , your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit = )	1
The tool holder works well . There is a little leakage of smoke , but I do n't think this reduces the quality of food preparation or changes the temperature of the grill . The tool holder ships from a company other than Amazon , and the shipping/handling costs are more than the holder .	1
This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised . It is well made and easy to assemble . I have done 2 cooks so far ( baby back ribs , chicken , sirloin tip & salmon ) . As long as you do n't keep adding smoke-wood , but only do it at the beginning ( and do it sparingly ) you will have well cooked and flavorful food . I recommend trying the `` best ribs in the universe '' procedure for your first cook - found at [ ... ] I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same . P.S . - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around .	1
I used this in Vietnam , where the local butcher , Hang Kau Pung , asked me to use my gas grille for his yak . After butchering it , we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack . I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water . I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals .	1

This Weber is simply the best . Get it going , put in your meat - go to bed and get up the next morning to the best briskets and pork butts you ever had . It is amazing how this charcoal smoker can maintain such constant cooking temps whether it is -20 or + 99 outside .	1
I have only owned a couple smokers in my life , and after purchasing this one - I do n't plan on owning anything else . The Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker ( WSM ) is a simple , yet incredibly effective water smoker.The WSM has two cooking sections which allows you to smoke a good amount of food ( such as a whole turkey and a whole ham simultaneously ) . The 18 1/2 inch grates allow plenty of food , but you might have to get a little tricky if you want to smoke something like 8 racks of ribs . This can be done if you roll the ribs up and use a skewer to hold them in place . If you are n't trying to entertain large parties , then this is the perfect family smoker.The WSM is coated with porcelain enamel , much like the One-Touch kettle grills . The grates are triple-nickel-plated . The WSM is very sturdy . The material is nice and hefty , you do n't get the sense that this smoker was cheaply made . One of the only issues I have with this smoker is the access door . Instead of being hinged it comes completely off the smoker . It can take a little bit of figiting to get it to attach to the smoker , but this is an extremely small issue.The reason people love this smoker is because with a single batch of charcoal you can smoke for an incredibly long time . If you use the minion method then you can smoke for up to 18-20 hours without adding anymore charcoal ! For those who are n't aware , the minion method is where you fill the charcoal ring with unlit charcoal , light about 10-15 briquettes and place them on top of the unlit charcoal . Please do n't use the minion method with pre-soaked coals . My first smoke was a brisket and for the first 5 hours it stayed exactly at 245 degrees without any adjustments ! I thought my thermometer was broken ... it was n't - this smoker is incredibly efficient . Another example is the second time I smoked with this . I smoked a 10 lb brisket , started at midnight . It finished 5:00 PM the following day . That 's 17 hours right there . I roused the coals a bit and was able to smoke some stuffed jalapenos for another 2 hours . That 's 19 hours on a single batch of charcoal ! I am very impressed . I have a Brinkman smoker and when I used that smoker I would get about 2 hours of burn time . The WSM is just so much more efficient and has MUCH better air control.Here are a couple of tips if you plan on buying a WSM ( and you should ! ) .Get a decent enough thermometer , such as a candy thermometer so you can check your temperature at the lid . This will become instrumental in your cooking.Unfortunately the WSM has a small water pan . What you should do is buy a replacement Brinkmann Smoke N Grill charcoal pan ( do n't get the water pan , make sure you get the charcoal pan ) . You can buy one directly from Brinkmann for about $ 13.00 . If you look hard enough you can find them online for around $ 5.00 - $ 10.00 . The Brinkmann charcoal pan fits perfectly inside the WSM as a water pan ( some say it fits even better ! ) . It also holds more then double the amount of water then the standard WSM water pan . This allows you about 7-8 hours of cooking before needing to refill the pan , which is much better then the 2-3 you get with the standard water pan . Once your temps stabilize you can easily do overnight cooks and also get some shut-eye ! To conclude I would like to say that if you are even thinking about getting a vertical water smoker then stop looking right now . This smoker is near perfect in every single way . With a few tiny modifications you can own one of the best smokers in the world at this price !	1
This thing is ridiculous ! It holds a temperature better than my electric oven . I can load it up with charcoal , set the vents , and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours . If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good , try their best menu item and compare it to the `` Q '' you 'll produce on this cooker and you 'll never eat out again . I 've made baby back ribs , meatloaf , pork butt , spare ribs , and fatties ( smoked sausage rolls ) and they 've all turned out delicious . Buy it , you wo n't regret it .	1
This is a great product . It lives up to the Weber name . The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape . It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time , and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs , a 15 pound brisket , or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat , causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque !	1
The description does n't do this rib rack justice . This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken . You will certainly not complain about running out of room ! Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood , there 's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8 . Washing it may be a problem . Just wash it immediately after using it .	1
This is a nice item when you want to keep your food off the cast iron grates . Useful for numerous food items . Good quality .	1
I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review . The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do . I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle , and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke . If this happens , I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I 'm not entering anything in a competition ! Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color .	1
Increase your grill capacity . Works great . The only drawback is having to take the ribs out of the rack to baste them .	1
I have used this twice now . Once for baby back ribs ( pork loin back ) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs . It worked great both times , but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs . This was because the spare ribs were straighter ( less curve to the rib bones ) than the baby backs and stood upright better . The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it . But this was a minor issue . Overall the unit worked great .	1
You wo n't find a better way to start your coals for the Webber Smokey Mountain cooker . Following directions I had half of the coals I needed nice and white hot for my cooker in about 10 minutes . It is built better than the ones I have seen at Ace Hardware and other places . There is an inverted cone grill at the bottom that enables the starter to have more surface area for the newspaper sheets that you use to get the thing started . You will not be sorry you ordered this along with your WSM cooker !	1
Just like everyone else has said , this is a winner.I 've owned a few different chimney starters over the years and just never could get them to work reliably . I always ended up going back to lighter fluid . Yes , it stinks and it 's expensive and it can ruin the taste of your meal if you do n't let the charcoal burn down for a long time but it worked every time . Those Brand X chimney starters did n't always get the charcoal going.The Weber is larger and the design is well thought-out . Instead of a few holes in the bottom of the charcoal section , it has a grate . And the grate is kind of reverse-cone shaped so more charcoal comes in contact with the burning newspaper . The result -- it lights pretty much perfectly every time . All it takes is two broadsheet pages of newpaper stuffed in the bottom . That 's two broadsheets -- the equivalent of eight pages of your morning newspaer . You can also use paper towels -- they create less ash . If you want , you can lightly spray the newpaper or towels with a little Pam or the like . That 's gets the paper to burning quickly.Do n't bother with those small , poorly designed , no-name ( or even big-name ) chimney starters you see around . The Weber is the one to get .	1
1 . It is taller than the cheapos and has more chimney effect so it works better.2 . Is made of heavier gauge steel than the cheapos and lasts longer . I just leave mine outside . It takes years to rust through . My old one lasted about 5-6 years.3 . It will rust like any steel exposed to high heat , so the thicker the metal , the longer it will last.4 . The length of time to start the coals depends on the brand of coals , their moisture content , humidity and the way you crumple up the newspaper.5 . If the coals fail to catch , then repeat the process . Do not pour lighter fluid into it . Doo.6 . I just grab the insulated handle and pour the coals out . I do not use the tipping handle thing so I do n't need gloves.7 . One of the features of a Weber , and some other grills , is that after you finish grilling , you can shut off the vents and save some of the coals for next time . So , pile the newly lit coals over the old ones . This lights them up and gives you a longer fire as well.8 . Weber offers little wire fences that allow you to keep the coals off to one side of the grill . Use this feature . Pour your coals into this area , sear your meat quickly and then move it off to the non-coaled area and put the lid on and let it cook slowly to completion . Add specialty wood chips at this time if you wish . This gives the best result.9 . Weber stuff seems to be the best , at least in its price range , and they offer a lot of quality accessories that are properly designed.10 . Many stores are now just stocking a cheap Chinese brand of chimney . Thin , small , short and just ca ca in general . Do n't encourage the b******s , get the real thing._____________________________These are great . The one I reviewed is still good after hundreds of uses.FIRE-STARTING UDATE : sprinkle a little olive oil , or other cooking oil , on the balled-up newspaper . It makes for a hotter and longer-lasting fire that so far has started my charcoal the first time , every time . I also shred the paper and then ball it up . Takes a couple of pages . Do n't use the slick paper advertising inserts .	1
This takes all the work out of lighting charcoal for the BBQ . Will help you light and heat up your grill in approximately the same amount of time as a regular gas-grill . Best part is there is absolutely no need for cancer-causing lighter fluid under any circumstances . A good gift for the charcoal-phob or charcoal-challenged .	1
If you use charcoal you need this ! It really works ! Just load your bricks throw some paper on the bottom light the paper and in about 5 minutes your bricks are ready for action !	1
at least three time a week year around . I 've used the Weber chimney starter every time . The 'old ' ones were lighter gauge than the current product and they lasted about three years . The latest one is heavier gauge and perhaps it will last longer . I recommend this item .	1
I got this because of all the great reviews here on amazon . Some of the reviews said that all you need is 2 sheets of newspaper that was all . and I was like That 's not possible . Well it is . this thing is incredible ! It starts up quickly and is good to use in about 10-15 min . I have noticed that lower quality bricks do not work as well and that if you over stuff the bottom with paper it will not work right . It smokes a lot ! I suggest closing your windows . You really need to have 2 of them when doing large meats such as turkey 's and half pigs . That way you can start enough charcoal right off the bat . It also says that you should wait until the coals have a slight white ash on them . I would have to disagree with that because the coals are 30 min from being burned up by then . I wait until the center is red hot and flames are leaping from the top . It seems the coals last longer that way . for 15 bucks it 's a no-brainer . Get it !	1
This past summer I tried a charcoal grill for the first time and as a result my gas grill was never taken out of the garage . It 's become an obsession of mine and now I have three different grills , one smoker and a collection of different wood chunks . My newest obsession never would have taken root if there was not an easy , foolproof way of starting the lump or the briquettes . I do n't have any other chimney to compare this to but it works perfectly every time . Two sheets of newspaper , dump in your fuel of choice and light it . 10-15 minutes later the coals are ready to go . If you think the newspaper gives too much ash try paper towels sprayed with some cooking oil instead . If you grill on a deck be careful when you light it or where you put it after dumping out the coals as it gets very hot .	1
Dump some charcoal in the chimney , crumple a few sheets of newspaper into the bottom , light the papers , wait a while , and you have ashed , ready to use coals . This is so much easier and healthier than dousing the charcoal with starter fluid and more convenient than using the electric starters . If I 'd known this sooner , I would 've bought my charcoal grill a long time ago !	1
Like many other charcoal barbeque enthusiasts , I hate using charcoal lighter fluid . ( Who wants toxic junk smoldering all over their food ? ) For years I have used an electric lighter , but ours was on its last legs . I was tempted to buy a gas grill , as they are fast-lighting , but just really did n't want to spend the money on a product that does n't perform the way I like . So , based on the favorable reviews , I decided to try the Weber Chimney Starter.Wow . Really.I was accustomed to putting the electric lighter under the coals , and preparing other parts of the dinner while the coals were getting started . And after they had gotten started , it took a while for the fire to really get rolling.I use a Weber barbeque , and every time after I have finished grilling , I close down the vents and save the briquets for another use . I only have to add a couple of handfuls of new briquets each time I cook.I stuffed the bottom of the Weber chimney starter with newspaper as directed , put in the cold leftover briquets from the last grilling session , and added the usual amount of new briquets . I lit the newspaper as directed . At first all it seemed to be doing was producing a copious amount of smoke . I walked away , and came back just a few minutes later to find the charcoal flaming away most impressively . The coals were ready in about a quarter of the time that it took using the electric starter.Who needs a gas barbeque for a fast-starting fire ? I had my whole dinner cooked in a half hour from the time that I lit the newspaper . This charcoal starter is a gem ! Update ( June 29 , 2008 ) : After using this starter for almost a year ( yes , I barbeque in the winter ) I have a couple of notes to add . First , use only the amount of newspaper recommended . More newspaper cuts down the amount of air able to circulate through the fire , and you just end up with a smoldering mess . Secondly , do n't fill the container full of charcoal . Doing so extends the time it takes for all the charcoal to ignite , with the end result of making the handle too hot to comfortably hold . Even if you need a lot of charcoal , only fill the container half-full . Once the briquets are burning , dump them into the barbeque and put more briquets right on top of them if you need more .	1
I have n't used lighter fluid in years , ever since getting one of these.I did n't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going , but that 's really all you need . I use natural charcoal exclusively ( you know , real wood , not gravel and clay briquettes ) , and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You 'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire , and you wo n't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider : this thing gets very hot by its nature , so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle , and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals , so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools .	1
The Weber is the best chimney starter I have used . It 's bigger than most others , can be lifted and dumped with one or two hands , and the handle stays relatively cool . I just ordered a second so I can fill my relatively large barbeque all at once . If you are not into gas you need this tool .	1
I finally gave up on the lighter fluid and bought this last summer . What a brilliant idea ! I have always used lighter fluid and was notorious for using to much because the charcoal would n't light fast enough . That problem is solved with this chimney starter . The coals ignite quickly and a full blaze is going within minutes ! Once the flames have died down , just dump them out and start grilling ! I have the Performer grill but when I bought the grill , the store did n't have any cartridges so I have been using the chimney starter all summer . So it 's a nice backup if you have the Performer but no gas cartridge.This is a good product for the price .	1
This thing works great ! lights my charcoal with ease and without fluid . If you are picky about the taste of your food ( you will notice the difference if you grill without lighter fluid or pre-soaked coals ) then get this handy starter . It could n't be easier ! shove a couple pieces of newspaper on the bottom , fill it up with coals and light .	1
I have another no-name chimney starter that I bought a few years ago for around $ 15 . I 've used it for cooking dutch oven for a couple of years and it has worked fine , or so I thought . I recently purchased aWeber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smokerand bought this Weber Chimney Starter at the same time . It is MUCH bigger than the generic starter I 've been using , and the additional lift assist handle is great . The conical grate inside the starter allows the charcoal to get up to temperature much quicker than my old unit . I do n't know what I 'll use my old starter for now . From now on , it 's only Weber for me .	1
As an avid griller and lover of cooking on charcoal , I ca n't say enough good things about the Weber Chimney starter.This simple to use chimney style starter quickly lights enough lump or briquette charcoal to fill your 22 1/2 inch weber grill WITHOUT LIGHTER FLUID ! ! Lighting is easy . Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney , place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom . Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill . In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin ' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts . About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal , use this puppy to light your coals , and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier , I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters . On windy days they are easier to use than newspaper.Once you use this you will never go back to using lighter fluid again . A must have for anyone who owns a charcoal grill .	1
I 've used chimneys for 50 years and this one is the best I 've ever had . It 's construction is solid and its handles are positioned to keep ones hands and arms away from the heat .	1
A couple years ago my wife complained about how she could taste the lighter fluid in some of the things I grilled . The charcoal just was n't getting hot enough to burn it all off , especially on cold , rainy days . By the time the ligher fluid was burned-off , the coals were nearly gone , too.We had just seen Alton Brown 's Good Eats episode , The Grill Seakers . He had used a chiminy starter to get his charcoal going , so when we saw one in the store , my wife told me to buy it and try it.Well , after two years of use , that cheap starter has gotten to the point where it 's ready to fall apart . I needed a new one , and I needed to add something inexpensive to my Amazon.com order to qualify for free shipping , so I ordered this one.I 've got to say , even though I read the reviews , I just was n't expecting something so big ! This thing has half-again as much capacity as my old one . It 's also a heavier guage metal , and a better handle.One hint : I lightly spray my newspaper with corn oil before putting it in the chiminey . It never burns away too fast , as just two sheets can do if there 's enough wind , and I do n't find myself packing too much newspaper in . I always get a good fire going , with no lighter fluid taste .	1
boyfriend got this for xmas and he loved it . We have n't used it yet but he looks forward to it !	1
The other reviews are correct . This unit works very well in every way , a basket mesh kind of food holder would be a good option , use a drip pan and keep the coals off to the sides , the ring riser/extension is useful for smoking and cooking big things , etc . It is all good , but there is more : Who do you know who actually has a charcoal grill and a rotisserie ? Nobody . If you get one , your guests will be entertained on several levels and you will be the Master . A rotisseries is professional looking , produces unmatched taste and an exciting demonstration-style cooking experience for everyone . Those that utilize them are seen as proficient and competent . Not a bad label for you , eh ? Might get you somewhere.The best meal I ever had was a rotisserie turkey that saved me from starvation after a Hike of Death . Perhaps it can save you or a loved one.Rotisserie cooking lends itself to the acclaimed high heat , short cooking time technique . Hot coals and the self-basting action work well here . One of the major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known and strongly recommended the high heat way . This is also the suggested method for cooking heritage meats and wild game.Starting out at 500+ degrees and ending at something short of US government temperature recommendations is the secret . A turkey , for example , is best taken out of the heat at around 170 , or less , and allowed to rest . It will go up around 10 degrees after that.I tie bacon strips onto the breast and add wet smoking wood chips to the coals . Stuff the cavity with an orange and some garlic . Other things could be used , too . I have rotisseried heritage , free range , organic , kosher and regular good quality supermart turkeys with this high-heat method and they have all been good.Governments and institutions have to recommend a heat guaranteed to kill off any and everything , and prevent lawsuits of course . However , fresh good quality meat does not have to be nuked to the point where you could make furniture out of it . Use a separate thermometer , not the supplied pop-out sensor . I am no professional , but I can say it produces the best tasting food.___________________________________UPDATE : Years later , it still works . Here are some things that will help you if you get one of these . First , for a turkey , get two oranges and stick them in the cavities . Then , stick the skewer through them . This keeps the turkey from wobbling around so much as the oranges act like bearings . Also , get some meat wrapping string and spend the time it takes to tie the legs , tail and wings up to the skewer so that the turkey is more like a ball without all sorts of dangling things flopping around . Use lots of string . It is cheap . Know that all the energy of the universe will try to circumvent your efforts , so over-do it with the string . Cut it off with scissors before serving.Coat the turkey with olive oil . Do n't baste it again.Obviously , do n't stuff it ! I do n't use the bacon anymore . If you use the temperature recommendations , you wo n't miss the bacon . It was a pain to tie on and was kind of a waste.The Polder remote thermometer is nice because the probe is thin and does n't create a big hole.I stop at 160 degrees now . That 's just me . Remember , you can cook it more , but you ca n't remove the overcooking.Learn how to cut the breast meat off . Do n't slice it off while it is on the turkey . Instead , cut down right alongside that breastbone . Then cut in from the side , about half-way down the side , straight in . This gives you a big chunk from that one side . On a plate , cut it in slices , across it , across the grain . So much more professional and better in every way . And it is easier . If you are having trouble visualizing this , you can google up a demo video or illustration.I saw a TV show where it was demonstrated that soaking the chips makes no difference , so I do n't anymore . A couple of handfuls gives a nice , not overwhelming little smoke flavor . You may want more , or none.The Weber a fine device and one that surely will make you the rockstar of turkey cooking . Imagine how pathetic your relatives will seem when they take their sad turkeys out of the oven after hours of worthless basting . There will be murmuring and eye-rolling from those who remember yours . Make sure you tell the others , loudly , how you just sit around drinking while your turkey rotates effortlessly around , cooking perfectly . By the time the hosts are finished with excuses as to why their turkey sucks , again , you will be elevated to near rock-god status . Humiliation is an essential part of any family holiday and you want to be the one doing the humiliation.See the review of the Weber chimney charcoal starter for a good tip on that .	1
I waited way too long to buy one of these rotisseries . What was I thinking ? This thing is fantastic ! I cook on my Weber charcoal kettles all the time . It always comes out great , except for the one time my Beagle chased a deer into the woods and I had to go after her . I got back about thirty minutes later and my chicken was ruined . I actually ended up feeding it to my Beagle , so now I am thinking maybe she did it on purpose ? They are pretty smart . And chasing a deer had to be a ruse to distract me , I mean seriously , what was she going to do if she actually caught the deer ? The rotisserie chickens I have cooked so far have turned out much , much better than all the other ways I have cooked chicken over charcoal . And I have cooked chicken a lot of different ways.I have read that rotisseries are self-basting because most of the juices do n't drip , they just kind of roll around over the chicken . Maybe . But all I know is as long as I take the bird off at around 165 degrees , cover it for about ten minutes , then serve it , it always comes out fantastic.If you have one of these you know what I am talking about . If you do n't , you should get one , you will like it.This is not just for chicken or turkey . I cooked a chuck roast to slightly over rare and then sliced it up for some excellent roast beef .	1
This Weber Rotisserie is the best grilling item that I have bought so far . I did two Cornish Hens and they were so moist and juicy , I could n't wait to try a roasting Chicken . Well , I finally tried one , and oh , my God ! ! ! ! It was AWESOME ! ! ! The taste was like no other rotisserie Chicken that I have ever eaten ! ! I cooked it slow , about 3 hours , starting with about 12 coals on each side , using the indirect cooking method . I added more coals every hour to keep the temperature about the same ( about 325-350 ) . I experimented with basting it with Beer when I added more coals . I also added soaked hickory wood chips with the coals each time . To die for ! ! ! I also tried a Pork roast . The same awesome results were obtained . Next I will try a Turkey . I am totally sold on this item , and highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Weber 22-1/2 '' kettle grill . You wo n't be disappointed ! !	1
this kettle rotisserie works GREAT . it 's a much better design than what 's shown in the ad . what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill , with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal . it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one . WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it 's super quiet and works very well . the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill . I really did n't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I 'm glad I did . this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it .	1
This rotisserie is made for weber 22 inch charcoal grills . I got this from amazon and it shipped in record time . This is a simple accessory with few parts . There is the skewer with the two prongs that slide over and screw onto it to hold your meat in place . There is a big ring that sits on top of your kettle and the lid goes on that . There 's a screw-on counterweight to help with even rotation . And then the motor that slides onto a bracket on the aforementioned ring . That 's it . Basically no assembly required . Do you like beer can chicken ? You wo n't bother after using this . I 'm not a chef so I ca n't explain how spinning the meat around makes it so good but it does . Juiciest bird ever , seriously . Also does roasts well with excellent results too . I have n't used this for a turkey but I ca n't see how that would n't be outstanding as well . The motor is quiet , if you care about that kind of thing . The plug attached to it is ridiculously short so you will probably need an extension cord . I recommend keeping the box it comes in for storage because otherwise it 's kind of bulky and random in the garage . The only criticism is it 's expensive . But it 's one of the coolest BBQ things i own and would buy another in a heartbeat if it was stolen or broken . But Weber does n't make them anymore ! So if you are thinking about this , buy now before they are gone forever . I wish I could get extra prongs for the skewer so I could do two of whatever I am doing without have to jerry-rig it .	1
This is the best accessory you could own for your grill . It produces fantastic chickens ( I do two at a time ) , roasts , leg of lamb , and ( my favorite ) turkey . My brother-in-law brought his smoked turkey to compare with my rotisserie turkey for Thanksgiving . My turkey was gone and his was mostly there.If you own a Weber Kettle Grill ( 22 1/2 inch ) you NEED to have one of these .	1
Super fast shipping . Great addition to my Weber 221/2 '' Performer barbecue ! What 's confusing is that I called Weber 's customer service and they told me that the rotisserie would not fit the Performer barbecue . OK then I e-mailed there tech staff , e-mail sent back also saying that the rotisserie would not fit the performer ! ( Neither correspondence could tell me why it would n't fit ) . I read the reviews on Amazon and there were two which said that the rotisserie fit and worked fine on their performers . So I purchased one and they are correct it fits and work 's great.Thanks guys ! ! I will be calling Weber again today to dispute their claims !	1
This Rotisserie is too expensive , but on the other hand it 's well built , and does a great job . I bit the bullet and bought it on sale . I 'm very pleased with it . I 've had other rotisseries for other grills . And while they all do the job , the Weber seems to just float along effortlessly . The motor seems to be well built , and strong . Another reviewer said Weber is n't making this any longer . I have heard that elsewhere as well . It 's the perfect match for your grill , so do n't wait if you want one . I 've done Chicken , Roasts and Pork loin on it , all came out beautifully tender and moist . Once you use this , you 'll never make beer-can chicken again . I use it with the Weber charcoal pans for indirect cooking . A match made in heaven , or where ever the Weber factory is ! FYI ... . I have an old `` Universal fit '' rotisserie from an old grill . I found that the basket it came with , and the meat forks fit well on the Weber spit . Also , the motor fits on the Weber bracket , and the Weber spit fits into the old motor fine .	1
After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight , I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning . A little over 2 hours later , I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop . The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen . The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal . So much for the other food groups . It was completely devoured . There was literally nothing left . My wife , daughters , and their friends kept repeating , & quot ; That was the best turkey I ever had . You deserve a trophy ! & quot ; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I 'm going to roast another bird.Folks , this is a must-get addition to this grill . Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose . I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I 'm off to Safeway for another Butterball . I wonder where I 'm going to put my next trophy ?	1
This rotisserie cooks great . It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill . Like some mentioned in the other reviews , the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill . I do n't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover . Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless , the rotisserie works and cooks great . I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill .	1
I have one of these to use in the front yard where there are concrete paths . I roll it along as I pull weeds or do other chores in the garden . The fact that there is a rather clumsy storage area does n't bother me too much , because the advantage is , you can pick up this stool and toss it around easily . You would n't be able to do that if the top opened . There 's room for snacks , drinks , sunglasses , gardening gloves , a trowel , etc.I also have one that does open and acts as a pull-cart . That one does get more use as I pile bags of mulch on it and drag it around the yard.Both have their purpose . The Hopper Mobile Garden Stool is solid . I 'm glad I have it.EDITED to say that I 've thought of two more uses for it.1 . You could toss it in the trunk of your car and easily take it with you to use as a chair.2 . Convince the children that it 's a self-propelled 'car ' and let them get some exercise . : )	1
This little thing works very well for what I bought it for : something to sit on while I work with my plants and garden that will roll as I work my way across the flower bed/garden . I 'd like it better if the storage compartment was closed in so that I could leave it full of supplies , sitting outside , but I just put it under a table or in my potting shed and it does fine . Well worth the price .	1
I use this to work in my raised garden . It is just the right height and you can carry your tools along with you and not lose them . When you have arthritis , you have a problem bending to do your lawn and garden duties . This is the answer .	1
After I started having trouble with a sore knee , I go this to help me in the garden . It 's lightweight so easy to move around the garden , holds my tools , and is perfectly sized for me to sit on while weeding , planting flowers and everything else . It has really saved my knees a lot of wear and tear and I am finding it super-convenient for storing my tools . It even had a holder for my water bottle . It 's great !	1
so cute and just the right size for me . Does not take up a lot of room and rolls great . Strong and durable and very handy and saved my aching back . Absolutely recommend .	1
This is my second cart . The old one is still serviceable in the garden after years of HOT and freezing weather . I use this new one in the house to scoot around cleaning floor boards or anything hard to reach . Saves my back . I have n't found it has a weight limit . I have used it to scoot some pretty heavy stuff from place to place . Unlike the description the top does not open although some of the photos on the box are a different model which does seem to have a hinged side . No matter I just reach under . It would be even better with a couple drainage holes . It can sometimes be difficult to roll on rough ground but given its light weight I just move it and sit back down . Highly recommend if bending is hard on your back .	1
We actually have two garden carts this one and another that is all metal . The metal one even has a seat like those you see on an antique tractor . The metal one looks to be the better one HOWEVER my wife prefers the Garden Hopper over it . It feels sturdier than the metal one and does not tip as easily . I have noticed that the metal one now needs repainted and some bolts replaced . Not so with the Garden Hopper . It has sat out in the sun for days and it 's paint has not faded . We do store it inside during the winter but we do that for the metal one too.My complaint is about the hinged lid . It takes too much force to open it . I realize that this is necessary because you do n't want the lid coming open when you pick it up to carry it . Honestly it 's just a minor complaint to me and does not detract in any way from the quality of this cart.All in all we are both happy with this cart .	1
All you have to do is pick this thing up to know that it 's hollow plastic parts . And all you need to do is sit on it once to know that this is one solid little stool.The manufacturer 's catalog that came in the box shows that their other products are children 's toys that are built for punishment , yet no so dangerous that they 'd crush a child . They 've carried that same quality construction through to this little stool.The wheels are a little on the small side to carry my 230-lb body across a patch of healthy lawn with ease , but it was n't so difficult that I would have to stand up and move it , either.I find it a tad inconvienent to reach under the seat to get to tools . There is a cup holder on the outside , but it 's design is such that it is n't good for anything but cups or cans . The one thing I 'd like to see here is some other sort of outside storage for tools instead of the cup holder.The all-weather plastic means you can leave it outside , but it 's lightweight design means you can store it on an upper shelf , too.All in all , the solid , but lightweight construction makes this one a keeper .	1
I ordered one of these becasue I was tired of pulling weeds from between the cracks on a patio I build that is a slate floor with sand filler surrounded by castle wall bricks with rose bushes behind . We have a lot of weeds that like to pop up and since our dogs play out there and eat grass poison was not an option . I bought this , got it a day later ( thanks amazon ! ) and hooked it up to my grills propane tank . Instantly I lit it ( why wait ? ! ? ! ? ) and man was this thing impressive ! It 's weeding with a flame thrower/torch . You literally only have to pass it over the weeds for a few seconds and they start to wilt . A day or two later they are dead . Now at this point you can pull them eaisly or relight your torch and burn em again ! : ) It by no means is `` magic '' but it does do the job as long as you are n't expecting the thing to vaporize weeds . It kills the cells of the plant and basically it starves it to death . I do recommend keeping the garden hose handy just because it 's a safety issue .	1
I bought this primarily for natural herbicide free weeding . Having an infant crawling around , I was really hesitant about spraying Roundup and having that leeching into the soil , not to mention , our property borders a creek . I ordered this and had it the next day ! Hooked it up and immediately began flame throwing . Thankfully , I began in the middle of our brick patio . This baby kicks out quite a flame . It was a breezy day , I suggest using this when there is little to no wind . It does n't produce a tight concentrated flame like a propane soldering torch for plumbing would.Honestly I almost canceled the order in lieu of the $ 28 model from Harbor Freight . Thankfully you ca n't yet do that on an iPod touch or mobile phone . The more I thought about it , do I really want to trust an inferior tool when I am dealing with 100,000 BTU ? Do keep a fire extinguisher or hose on hand ! I did this the day after a rainstorm , which I 'd suggest . Do NOT do it when it is dry outside . Even so , the grass caught on fire a couple of times.Next task ... . I have a carpenter ant hill right where the sand box is supposed to go . No need to pesticides , I 'll turn the ground and flame away . Not even summer yet , and I ca n't wait to try this on the ice in the driveway !	1
I 've used the `` vaporizer '' twice and love it ! I have a gravel driveway - what a pain to use Roundup to kill the little grasses and weeds sprouting in the spring ; it does n't take much to fry them plus , on a cold day , the gravel gets warmed by the torch so my feet stay toasty . I was initially concerned about lugging around the big propane tank on my dolly - not a hassle at all , the torch extends about 10 feet out so a big area can be covered . Just be careful with dry grass - it catches on fire easily so keep an eye out for persistent flames . Otherwise , a big time-saver - I wish I had some snow or ice to melt .	1
Ease of use is very straight forward with not much to go wrong . Even comes with a sparker . I use this as a log starter for my BBQ Pit and it does a great job . I 'm also looking forward to having it this winter to de-ice the walks .	1
Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent . So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal . I love this product . It does n't stop weeds from growing back , but you 'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again . I am 6'2 '' and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer , but still love this product . The hose could be another 2 feet longer , but again , you want to own one of these weeddragons . The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop . I did not want to go inside when it got dark . Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles . One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby , but you 'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby .	1
I love this neat little household `` tool . '' It 's compact , light , sturdy , folds up , easy to carry , hose-off-able and makes getting up and down from my knees SO much easier . I even realized that I could bring it inside and it made a perfect stool for cleaning low cabinets or a kneeler for scrubbing baseboards . Absolutely recommend . I 'm thinking of getting them as gifts for my home-owning family members and friends .	1
I have owned this bench/kneeler for some years and would not part with it . It is lightweight but amazingly strong . It is a ready made seat for me in the garage , and it does n't take up much space . I am ( unfortunately ) 175 pounds , and this bench supports me easily . Because of arthritis , the kneeler option is a must for me out in the garden not just because of my knees but because the bench 's legs will help me stand up . This is money well spent for anyone you know who is a serious gardener .	1
Just about everybody over the age of thirty has some kind of issue with knee and/or back pain , esp . when you want to do seasonal clean-ups inside or out.I was kind of flabbergasted when I was on my hands and knees , cleaning the bathroom floor , and my knees ... hurt ! ... just from kneeling on the tile . I bought this device to help with that chore , and it 's a lifesaver . It 's made for outdoor use ( and it 's one of the sturdiest things I 've ever bought ) , but for me it 's been wonderful for indoor cleaning.The reviews here are excellent , so I do n't want to reinvent that wheel . There are just two things I 'd add from my own observations ; that is , things you might not know until you actually order and get this kneeler.First of all , the yellow pad is on both sides , it 's not just padded one one side . Now as it 's show in this picture , it 's something to sit on . If you burn it upside down so the yellow pads are a few inches off the floor , behold ! It 's a kneeler ! The metal `` arms '' that become long when you flip it over are extremely sturdy . If you have problems working on the floor and getting up , they 'll hold your weight easily and make getting off the floor a breeze ( you do n't even have to be kneeling ON it to use it as a sturdy prop to stand up . ) The other thing is that the device is folded up when you get it . To use it , you just open one `` leg , '' then the other . Some folks seem to have problems folding it back up ( very easy to store . ) To do this , look for the springs on each side . There is a metal bar that runs perpendicular to the springs . Grasp the bar AND the spring section and squeeze . It 's very resilient . You do n't have to force the two bars together , but just enough to loosen the knobs that click into place when you open the device . When you squeeze ( and yes , it 's a bit hard if you 're a woman ) , push the arm down , and one half is folded . Do the same with the other side , and you 're done . ( To open it , just open each arm . It locks into place with no effort . ) You do n't have to be an AARP member to find this device to be incredibly useful . I bought two : one for indoors and one for outside stuff . I absolutely recommend it if you find that your glucosamine and chondroitin tablets are taking awhile to kick in with that knee pain !	1
For all the reasons the other reviewers listed , this item has become one of my `` must-have-it-with-me '' tools when I work in the garden . I love it !	1
This product enables those who have difficulty bending down to be able to work in the garden effectively and with ease . It is easy to set up and collapse for storage . It was priced fairly .	1
I really like this bird feeder but not for the fact that squirrels ca n't get into it . I have two dogs that make sure that does n't happen . Heck half the time they do n't even let the birds on it . But I love it because I went out the other day and four of my six bird feeders looked fine and had seed in them but when I inspected them the seed mix had gotten wet and clumped up so it no longer would come out of the feeder . Not this feeder ! The water ca n't get in to the seed area because the squirrel begone hood . This was the only feeder that was completely empty even though it was the newest edition and held the most seed . It 's a hit with me , the birds , and maybe even the dogs !	1
This is a study feeder , with a tube 4.5 '' in diameter . The seed comes out the bottom of the tube into a small tray that goes around the tube . The birds can feed through 4 holes in a metal sleeve that is suspended by a spring from the bottom of the tube.The main selling points on bird feeders seems to be 1 ) How squirrel-proof is it , 2 ) how long will it last , and 3 ) how much does it cost ? I will add a 4th of my own requirements , and that is how deer-proof is it . I have had deer come in Winter and tilt myPerky-Pet 7103-2 Copper Triple Tube Bird Feederfeeder and drain the whole thing in a night . The hoof-prints in the snow gave them away . ; - ) So this feeder appears to be both squirrel- and deer-proof . Tilting the feeder does lose some seed , but it does not flow out very easily , especially when the bottom part is pulled down like when a squirrel or deer is trying to get into it . The top dome also tilts when weight is on it , which will certainly cause squirrels and chipmunks to slide off . I think it 's a good design.How long will it last ? They claim a heavy-duty , powder coated finish , which I assume is over standard steel . The spring inside the bottom part to make it tilt I assume is steel as well . So this feeder will likely rust in maybe 5+ years , and once the spring rusts away , the bottom will fall off the tube - the spring is the only thing holding it on . You will have to get a new spring from Perky Pet . Aluminum or stainless steel would be better materials.How much does it cost ? This feed is on the expensive side , especially not knowing what materials it 's made of and how long it will last . I would wait for a price-reduction from the list price .	1
We have quite a few mature trees in our yard which provide an ideal place for bird feeders . Anyway that 's what I thought when we moved here . I hung several of the birdhouse style feeders and in no time the squirrels and chipmunks figured out how to scare the birds away and skillfully scatter their meal on the ground . I watched some even work in tandem to steal the bird food.Perky-Pet has recently released their latest in a line of anti-squirrel bird feeders . They call this one the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone : The Baffler ( Model 397 ) . If you have ever observed a rodent at work , they are clever and persistent in their desire to secure food and housing for themselves . As you can probable see by the photo this bird feeder has a long clear plastic seed tube that makes up the body of the feeder and providing a visible place to store the bird seed . The bird feeder dimensions are 25 in . H x 11.7 in . W x 11.7 in . D ; the seed tube is about 4 inches in diameter and will hold a substantial amount of seed , up to 3 pounds ! Here is a promotional blurb I found on this product from Perky-Pet : '' Best Used For : Attracting and feeding birds without allowing squirrels to get the seed . This unique squirrel-proof feeder will increase your bird traffic while minimizing seed lost to squirrels . `` This feeder has an attractive shiny metal saucer-shaped lid ( or as Perky-Pet calls it `` a dome '' ) that connects to the top of the plastic seed tube . There is a hole at the center of the saucer to connect the two parts and at the same time provides a place for a ring to be fastened on the top of the dome for hanging . The dome is part of this new squirrel-baffling bird feeder , along with a very cleverly designed metal base that comes already attached to the bottom of the seed tube . There are four holes ( or ports ) about the size of dime around the metal base right through the seed tube . These holes are the feeding ports . Small perches are also attached to the base in front of each feeding port and are made out of metal just like the base for durability . Considering the dimensions of the perches and the feeding ports this bird feeder is obviously made for small lightweight birds ; No crows or pigeons allowed ! Now let 's get to the patented weight-activated base and other features of this squirrel-baffling bird feeder . The smooth metal dome is not secured tightly to the top of the seed tube which allows it to wobble around when any weight is applied from above or below ; like from a squirrel or large bird . According to Perky-Pet : `` The dome tilts and wobbles as well to throw squirrels off balance who try and land on the feeder . '' This also applies to those pesky crows that dominate our backyard in the mornings , scaring away the smaller birds we are trying to feed . Likewise , if weight is applied to the base , such as by a leaping squirrel , chipmunk or a large bird , the base swivels like a bucket under their weight , automatically closing off access to the feeder ports and preventing the loss of seed.There is very little assembly required . Perky-Pet has included an excellent sheet of instructions that are easy to follow and is written in English only . In fact , there are only two steps to complete assembly . All assembly applies to attaching the dome to the seed tube ; everything else comes already assembled . During assembly one thing concerned me . The seed tube is plastic and there are two small holes on opposite sides to attach the dome to the seed tube by poking the ends of a metal bracket through the holes . This feeder is not light and once 3 pounds of birdseed is added it is quite heavy . In my opinion , this is the weakest link of the Perky-Pet bird feeder . In order to prevent a future disaster I decided to drill-out the small holes so I could insert a 2-piece hard rubber grommet into each new hole . This allowed me to still insert the metal bracket as designed while also providing reinforcement for the plastic seed tube . Only time will tell whether my modification will prolong the life of the feeder , or not.Perky-Pet has three short and informative videos on their website explaining ( 1 ) How the Squirrel-Be-Gone Baffler works , ( 2 ) Where to place your bird feeder and ( 3 ) Instructions for cleaning the feeder . You can Google the website by typing the following in your browser window : perky-pet squirrel-be-gone baffler model 397.I had originally intended to hang the bird feeder on one of my wrought iron shepherd staff hanging poles but decided not to when I realized the bottom of this 25-inch bird feeder would only be hanging about 3 feet off the ground ; much too low and inviting for the numerous non-flying animals that roam around my backyard . After I watched the videos mentioned above I decided to relocate my bird feeder to a higher point and nearer to our birdbath ; I also added a hook to the end of the metal strap I am now using to hang the feeder from a protruding galvanized metal pole mounted horizontally on the bottom roof line of a large shed in the backyard . I have to use a stepladder to hang and remove the bird feeder , but that is no problem . This product was built in the USA with both U.S. and Chinese parts . The label information on the front of the box is written in English , French and Spanish.Overall I am pleased with this new bird feeder . The squirrels and crows have tried to access the feeder without success so far ; the wobble and tilt action has definitely kept them off guard . However , they are crafty and persistent animals and since there has been a minor amount of seed loss , mostly during the recent wind storm , the seed that did fall to the ground has kept them motivated to devise new ways to thwart the security measures built into this new Perky-Pet bird feeder.On the front of the box Perky-Pet added the following statement : '' Feeder base and dome tilt to baffle the squirrels and protect your bird seed ! Birds feed undisturbed from 4 feeding ports . `` I think Perky-Pet is overreaching reasonable expectations for this product by expecting small birds to feed undisturbed . There is always some animal around my neighborhood looking for a free meal ; either in the form of birdseed or in the shape of a bird . Though it would be nice , so far undisturbed feeding is not the norm around here.Otherwise , The Baffler has worked as promised . Since there are moving parts it stands to reason that some attention will be necessary in the future to ensure the mechanisms continue to wiggle , tilt and wobble . There is no mention about maintenance on the Perky-Pet website that I could find . Only time will tell how well this new feeder will work over the long haul . Since much of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone : The Baffler is manufactured with metal parts I expect my Perky-Pet bird feeder will outlast most if not all of the plastic and wooden bird feeders on the market . This bird feeder retails new for $ 73.99 , which is a hefty price for what you are purchasing . I know you can shop around and buy this bird feeder for much less than that .	1
My back yard is a haven for all sorts of wildlife- not just birds , but rabbits , squirrels , chipmunks and the occasional skunk . I choose plants that encourage wildlife , and I never use pesticides or herbicides . I 've never had a bird feeder , though . I was always worried about the effects of artificially feeding birds , but I was recently reassured by a naturalist that birds get their food from a great many sources , and one more source really wo n't make a difference . And so I ordered this feeder.Looking at the list price , you 'd expect it to be a pretty hefty , solidly-built device . If you did , though , you 'd be wrong . There are a couple of stampings , a molded base , a thin plastic tube , a couple of springs , some pieces of steel rod for perches ... and that 's it . It comes mostly preassembled , requiring only that you attach the mounting ring at the top of the feeder . That piece did give me some concern , as the main thing supporting several pounds of seed and feeder is a skinny # 6 screw . New , it has more than enough strength , but a few years outdoors might weaken it through corrosion.Filling the feeder is easy , although my first attempt resulted in a pound of birdseed scattered on my back porch . It was running out through the bottom of the feeder , and I could n't figure out why until I discovered a black plastic cap about an inch in diameter lying in the bottom of the box . It 's not shown in the wordless assembly instructions , but I managed to figure out that kit is supposed to close off the bottom of the seed chamber . It slips on to part of the molding that composes the inside of the base , with less than 1/2 '' of overlap . The only thing really holding it in place is the weight of the birdseed in the tube . Once the level of the seed falls below this cap , it could easily become dislodged , and the seed inside could run out . I considered gluing it on but that would make it impossible to access the springs inside if they became unhooked or broke . Once I had this figured out , filling the feeder was easy enough , although I was also concerned that the tube is suspended by two very thin steel wires that are inserted in two small holes in the plastic tube . This also seems like a potential point of failure . I hung the feeder under my maple tree , using a lightweight steel chain- something squirrels were unlikely to be able to chew though.That was several days ago , and since then we 've had two heavy rainstorms , neither of which managed to get any water into the feeder . That 's good . I have n't seen any squirrels try to get in , and I do n't see any seed spilled below the feeder- which suggests that perhaps the birds have yet to discover the feeder . It may well be that food is plentiful enough this time of year that the birds really are stressed enough to look for new food sources . I suspect that when cold weather comes , they might be a bit more motivated . I 'll be watching the feeder regularly between now and then ( my home office has a clear view of the feeder ) and I 'll update as the birds and squirrels discover the feeder . I 'll also update if any parts fail along the way.Update : A close inspection of the ground below shows evidence that the birds have indeed discovered the feeder , and it looks like the level of seed may have dropped a bit- I 'm going to put a mark on the tube to monitor the level . No signs of squirrel activity.Update II : The birds have definitely discovered it . There is n't too much wasted seed on he ground , but the level of seed has fallen least rabble , and I 've observed several birds feeding on- and right now it looks like two robins are having a bit of a fight over who has priority on it . Still ca n't give it any more than three stars , given the cost and construction , but it 's good to see that the birds are making use of it.Update III : The birds- or a combination of birds and other scavengers- are now consuming seed at a rate of two or three pounds a day from the feeder . I just refilled it , and I noticed a good deal of seed on the ground as well . As I type this on my back porch , there are four small birds on the feeder , and about eight or nine scavenging seed on the ground below.A this point I 'm undecided as to whether I 'll keep filling the feeder , get another , smaller , feeder , or just discontinue feeding until winter . I 'll probably buy another 20 lb bag before I make up my mind.Followup : It 's now June , and the feeder has been hanging in my yard since last August . It does n't look any worse for the wear . There are no paint chips , no rust , no cracks in the plastic reservoir . In short , it looks pretty much the way it did when I hung it 10 months ago . I 've discovered a number of things since first hanging it , too . Most commercial seed mixes at the big box stores are full of milo , a seed that no bird appears to care for , although they 'll eat it in an emergency . The best deals are to be found at country feed stores , buying mixes or making your own . I use a mixture that 's mainly of black sunflower seed , some cracked corn , safflower seed , and occasionally some cracked peanuts . This has something for just about every bird found around here , and has drawn a much wider range of birds to my yard than I 've seen in the past 27 years . I plan on adding a noter feeder or two , using different mixes in them feeders to get different birds , and maybe add a few birdhouses as well.July Update : I was working at one end of the yard when I heard a crash and turned just in time to see a squirrel sailing through the air after bouncing off the roof of the feeder . They still have n't figured out a way in , but one or two of the smarter ones may have realized than sitting on the feeder and shaking it can dislodge seed do they can eat what falls to the ground below- see the photo .	1
This is exactly the bird feeder I 've been looking for . We have a serious problem with very `` intelligent '' squirrels . They 've managed to get into every bird feeder I 've used and ruined most of them . This feeder is sturdy . It also works to keep the squirrels off , at least so far . I hung it on a moderately high branch where it 's easy for me to fill and so far the birds have figured it out , but the squirrels are kept at bay . I hope this continues.The feeder can hold three pounds of seed . That , of course , depends on the type of see you use . This is another plus for me . We have a lot of birds here and the other feeders would run out after one or two days . So far this one has lasted a week.The price is rather high , although not all that much worse than the feeders in the stores in town , but if it keeps the squirrels away and lasts several seasons , it 's worth it . It 's certainly better than investing in a new bird feeder every year and having it ruined .	1
Right out of the box - it does seem like good quality and looks to be nicely made . It was easy to assemble , fill and hang . I have had bird feeders before and even the ones that claim to be squirrel proof were broken into and essentially destroyed by my squirrels . I have it hanging on a shepherds hook and I have n't even seen a squirrel get near it . So far - so good .	1
I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products . I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof , EXTRA LARGE bird feeder ; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up . No clogging , no squirrels , great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder . If you do n't mind the price , I would urge you to purchase this feeder . It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard ! Happy Feeding !	1
We have had all sorts of birdfeeders , but I have to say , for some reason the squirrels do n't have anything to do with this one . We 've tried many squirrel-proof feeders , and well , most of them just are n't squirrel-proof . The squirrels can just take them apart if given enough time.I really ca n't tell you what it is about this one , but it does seem to work !	1
I hung this feeder in the same spot as another squirrel proof feeder that the squirrels never defeated but never stopped trying to vanquish it either.The squirrel-be-gone feeder is large with it 's eventual weight determined by the type and amount of seed used to fill it . Listed capacity is three pounds , but we keep it half full to keep the weight down . Filled to capacity this feeder requires sturdy support.It is easy to assemble the feeder with the only challenging part the piece that hooks into the plastic tube . Filling the tube is no harder than filling any other feeder of this type though I found that using a funnel makes filling much easier and neater . The base and baffle are made of powder coated metal - I 'm guessing aluminum because a magnet does n't stick to it.Most importantly , does it keep the squirrels at bay ? So far I 'd have to say yes because mostly they do n't even try to get into this feeder . Even if they could get past the baffle , the perches are too small for a squirrel to grasp securely . Even the Rodan-sized blackbirds in our yard have a difficult time getting food out of this feeder because the perches are too tiny for them also.A deer had mastered the other squirrel proof feeder and regularly emptied it . I do n't think Bambi will be ever to get seed out of this feeder.Yes , I was also taken aback by the listed price for this feeder . Yet , the price has gone down at least five dollars since I first saw it posted , and on the day I 'm writing this review it 's on sale at the Perky-Pet site for 59 dollars . Those who have spent years battling the squirrels might not mind paying this much for a squirrel-proof feeder that actually works.UPDATE - I filled the feeder to the top ; it holds lots of seed . The next morning the feeder was completely empty . We suspect deer who have previously emptied our other feeders . Will have to monitor the situation .	1
The Perk Pet 397 is almost like the Cadillac of anti Squirrel Technology . The top baffle helps serve to `` baffle '' the enemy , while allowing some birds to maybe stop and perch on the edges ... but , if they are too weighty , the baffle will tilt , kicking them off the top . Very few birds I 've seen on the feeder have tried landing on the baffle , so it may not work as a perch anyway.Baffles are old hat in the battle against the Squirrel Invading Army , however , so Perky Pet has enlisted even further help . The perch section on the lower portion of the feeder is spring loaded , so that when something too heavy for the feeder touches down , the battle line is closed and the invasion repelled.Unlike the Droll Yankee , THE M1 Abrams in the Squirrel Invasion Prevention Army , is much more expensive than this model . I do not own one , but I can see how someone would want one if they have a bigger squirrel problem than just 2-3 of the little pains . This , of course , in no way justifies the cost of the Perky Pet 397 , as $ 75 is a really expensive feeder . Sure , it works , but you better have a really bad squirrel issue to buy into this one in my opinion.Missing is the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the perch latch , though I 've seen a few cardinals on ours , so I assume such birds wont be an issue and will still be able to feed.The feeder is easy to assemble and easy to fill . One thing to note , if you plan to fill this to capacity , ensure wherever you are hanging it has the ability to withstand the heavy load . This thing holds a lot of seed.Overall , I 'm happy with the feeder and its squirrel thwarting capabilities . Where I struggle is the price . For $ 50 you can buy 2 baffles , one for above and one for below a regular feeder . Unless you give the little suckers a place to hang out between the 2 baffles , you pretty much succeed with squirrel immunity . If you want an all in one solution , have the ability to hang this with a full load of seed and just want to hang it and forget it , this is definitely not a bad solution to the Squirrel Invasion .	1
It took a while for my hummingbirds to get used to the new feeder before they started sitting instead of feeding while hoovering . Once they figured this out , it is their favorite feeder .	1
I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones . I mounted it on my kitchen window , under an awning on the northeast side of the house , not at all expecting anything to happen . A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day ! It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself . In fact , I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach ! Fortunately , nothing broke . I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You ca n't beat glass . I 'm just totally getting away from plastic these days ... .	1
This is one of my favorite feeders , because it 's right there in front of your nose ! Hummingbirds are very fast . I 've gone entire years only seeing one sighting that year because I was n't sitting by the feeder when they happened to come by . By sticking the feeder where it is always visible , that little movement will catch your eye , and you 'll probably see them daily ! I know I do ! Because it 's made of glass , and not plastic like the normal seed-feeders , it is on the heavy side and needs to be attached securely . I read some reviews where people had trouble connecting it . I found it quite easy , just clean the glass , oil the cups a bit and press . It 's stayed up for years without any problem.I also read some reviews where people said they had trouble filling it . Just about EVERY hummingbird feeder I have has a small exit area - otherwise the nectar would n't come out slowly ! A funnel is 39 cents and makes filling *very* easy.I have 10+ hummingbird feeders and this is by far the best for consistant hummingbird viewing .	1
I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully , which I did and it has never come down , been up for at least a month . When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other . It also does not leak . Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window . Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick .	1
The window feeder is an awesome feeder and it is actually the most visited feeder that I have.I 'm sure it 's the location more than not but also the feeding ports are easily accessible to the rubythroated hummingbird..Please be aware though that ants will eventually find it . With this in mind , be hesitant to remove that spider web on your window sill . Spiders are nature pest control .	1
I ordered these little brushes to clean my hummingbird feeder , but you would be amazed at how useful they are around the kitchen and around the house . They fit into orifices and crevices when nothing else will .	1
It would be even nicer if they were packaged in different lengths and sizes ( or at least one had a longer handle ) .	1
Actually , the name of this product describes them perfectly & # 8211 ; & # 8220 ; Perfect Little Brush. & # 8221 ; I actually have three sets of these . I had originally purchased them specifically for cleaning our hummingbird feeders but found that they are extremely useful for so many different things.I use them to clean small kitchen appliances , detailing our cars , cleaning power tools and cleaning fishing reels and my target pistols . They work quite well in any small and hard to get at area . They are stout enough to get the job done , yet they are gentle enough to not damage the thing you are cleaning.If you have hummingbird feeders then these , or something like them , is almost a must . Feeders need to be kept extremely clean and need to be cleaned often . These perfect little brushes make our lives so much easier . We have , at times , up to 12 feeders going and cleaning them is a major chore.The price here is very competitive to what we paid here locally ... IF you have Amazon Prime and get the free shipping . If you have to pay shipping you might want to see if you can purchase the locally . We buy ours at a local wild bird store . Although I will say that if you keep any eye on these brushes here on Amazon you will find that the price changes quite often.All in all this is a great product and I do highly recommend it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
This set of three , multi-colored bottle brushes is perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports and other small holes and places . For example , I have reserved one to clean out the small spouts in my fountain which tend to clog with algae as the summer wears on . Each brush is about 3.5 inches long , with a tapered head that begins at 1/8 inch and widens at the base to 1/4 inch . The brushes can crush down to a much more narrow diameter than that , of course -- the width of the wires that hold the brushes , less than 1/16 of an inch . The plastic handles are rigid , although they can accidentally be snapped in two with pressure . The wired support of the brushes themselves is only slightly flexible ; you wo n't be able to work these brushes around corners and inside the base of a feeder bottle.These are basically short , rigid , reusable pipe cleaners . They are perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports or any other job requiring those qualities. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
These brushes really do get in the ports for cleaning hummingbird feeders . I suspect the hummingbirds appreciate all the works I do for them - they come here year 'round but I wish they would tell their friends .	1
I am a bit reluctant to give these brushes five stars because they are priced as if they are gold plated . However , I am rating them strictly on their use and that does earn a five star rating . They fit perfectly into the openings in my hummingbird feeders and do the job well for which they are intended . Having three different colors is a handy feature for balancing out the use . A fine , if overpriced , product .	1
This is a very well made brush that is good for feeder ports , especially hummingbird feeders . So far for me it 's been tough enough that after several uses its still holding its shape , and without shedding . I like it and feel it is well worth the price here on Amazon , ( especially with the free shipping that is being offered at the time of this writing ) . The only thing I feel I should make extra note of is its really small size . It 's only 3 1/2 '' long , which makes it kinda useless for anything but ports on feeders . If you want to get down to the bottom of a tube feeder where it really gets nasty over time , you will need to pick up a long bottle brush . Also , if you do buy this brush for use on feeder ports , I would toss the suggestion of keeping it around your sink for other uses that 's mentioned in the description . You will be bringing in all kinds of bacteria from dirty feeders into your kitchen . You can wash it well of course , but it 's still a better idea to either keep one of these strictly for other uses than feeders , or buy some other brush for your kitchen sink . Recommended for its quality and price.. : )	1
Bought these to clean the feeder ports on my hummingbird feeders and they work perfectly ! Great product ! You wo n't be disappointed with these	1
I took these and cleaned my old hummingbird feeder and boy are they great to use . Will keep the mold off the sip holes and that will be a blessing for all .	1
These are much smaller than I expected , I did not read the description well , I guess . But I love them anyway they are perfect for getting into the little tiny holes of the hummingbird feeder to clean them well . I was using a pipe cleaner before , but these are reusable , so they are perfect for the job !	1
I found mine does n't droop , and it has a good lighting area . I 'm using it for seedlings after they germinate . I 'm very happy with it .	1
This is the best one i could find on Amazon for a reasonable price . I love that it came with the bulb and clamp !	1
I bought this to provide supplemental light to my Bonsai and it works perfect for what I needed . The clamp is very strong and the fixture easily clips on securely and holds the light in place . Other reviewers have mentioned the light gets hot . I disagree a bit , the light does get fairly warm but not too hot . I have the light 13 & # 34 ; from my Bonsai plant and the warmth is hardly felt . The housing for the bulb gets the hottest but I really do not think it is much of an issue for me . I would not place the light near a curtain or blinds but I would not say it gets overly hot.+ Warm Color Light , Not Bright White Like Florescent bulbs+ Very Strong Clamp+ On/Off Switch+ Rotates/Twists/Adjusts to Many Positions+ Easily Replace Bulb+ Price+ Great Supplemental Light Source- Would be nice if the On/Off switch were on the cord not the housing_Bottom Line_ Yes , I would recommend this light to a friend . The further away the light is placed , the wider the angle of light allowing for multiple plants under the light . I have several plants under it and they are all doing very well . I just put two screws into a stud on the wall and then hooked the clamp to the screws . I am very confident the light is secure . I like that if/when the bulb goes out I can buy the same bulb or try something else .	1
This little light is easy to assemble , needing not much more than a screw driver to tighten the nut and screw . Once it is clamped down on another sturdy object , it stays put . It does n't wobble or come undone . The cord is five feet long . Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant , the effective radius is plenty enough ( about 24 '' from a foot away ) . I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage , and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users : the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT ! This lamp would not be recommended around birds or small children . However , set in a nice location this is a pretty lamp that provides good swivvel and warmth.This clamp comes with a 60-watt bulb , packed in its separate cardboard support .	1
I hope to remember to follow up in the spring as to how my herbs wintered , but I am very happy with how these lights set up.This is the first year I am trying to keep herbs growing , indoors , through the winter ... in northwest MT . I do have a room with fairly large south facing windows but at 48North , there is not enough sunlight and not good intensity to keep much going without supplemental light.I bought two lights and they easily and securely clamped on to a window valance ( bamboo ) . Not only do they give the plants good light ( I hope ! ) but they create a nice ambiance in the room which is also my office ( self employed computer programmer ) .I had thought to buy a light bar and stand - actually 2 - and make some shelf tables , but the other item in my personal mix is that I often travel by motorhome - and I travel through the winter . These lights will easily go along and allow me to take my little herb garden along . The light bar/stand options would not have worked for travel.It is a not very expensive experiment . I love to have fresh herbs . Based on other 's reviews , I have very high hopes .	1
This method is must easier than boiling water and waiting for sugar to dissolve . Our hummingbirds didnt seem to notice when we switched .	1
I love the powder nectar . Easy to prepare . Good buy online , prompt delivery ! Left over nectar keeps great in fridge and ready to use .	1
We recently purchased a new-to-us home in a nicely wooded area . Within a few weeks of moving in , we realized that there were more than a few hummingbirds around ... about that same time , we came across unused ( new-in-box ) feeders while helping my mother clean her garage . This all seemed like the making of a fun hobby , and we have not been disappointed.one of them was a Perky Pet 8 ounce feeder ( Perky-Pet 203CP Pinch Waist Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder ) and the boxed set she she came with one packet of this nectar , which we found to be easy to prepare ( very nice , since we really only have a couple minutes to get-it-done as we head out to work early morning ) .We cleaned the dust off the feeders , loaded them with nectar ... and then nothing really happened for the first few days . Just as we began to feel a bit of disappointment , we were encouraged when we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit.Following directions , we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week 's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started ! As week # 2 of our feeder experience really got underway , the feeders emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day . Guess the word got out ! By the middle of the fourth week , the 16 ounce feeder was emptying every 2.5 days or so and the 8 ounce feeder in a day or two . We had wonderfully colored green , yellow , blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs , and they are awesome to watch . They love this nectar , flying in to land on the feeder 's perch and sipping until content , then buzzing right off . There were even times when hummers seemed to do a little battle for prime sitting position , with the 'winner ' forcing the other one ( s ) to hover just a few inches away ( im ) patiently waiting for their tuns . Very interesting and beautiful to watch.It 's November and night-time temperatures are dipping below freezing , and our hummingbirds seem to have migrated away now . Ca n't wait to get the feeders and nectar back out in the Spring and watch them frolic again.Highly recommended ! Totally fascinating .	1
This nectar is easy to mix and left overs can be refrigerated . Since I went back to the instant versus the pre-mixed ; I 've gotten my hummingbirds back . : )	1
This product is very easy to mix . There have been some hummingbirds using it , yes we do have hummingbirds in the winter .	1
Besides Hummingbirds : this nectar & # 34 ; with NATURAL sweeteners & # 34 ; mix will also draw a variety of birds ; nectar feeding birds along with a few seed eating birds + it 's quick & simple to prepare.One 2 LB box contains 6 pre measured packets / makes 6 quarts of nectar.As with other nectar : the nectar feeders need to be refilled OFTEN ; especially before the birds have plenty of insects to feed on..Part of many nectar feeding birds diet also includes insects .	1
This is like a Tornado in your hands . Has 3 settings : Off , 1 and 2.1 is pretty powerful and can even move small rocks . 2 clears everything out of the way . Have n't tried it for the vacuum yet but that 's not why i got it .	1
I honestly believe that this is the best , most powerful leaf blower for the money . I mean , come on ... under $ 60.00 . The Toro name . Great power . Lightweight . Easy to handle . What else would you want ? OK ... so some people will be put off by the fact that it 's electric . Big deal . Get yourself an extension cord . I have a lot that 's 150 feet deep and it 's no problem maneuvering this thing with a cord attached to it . As far as noise goes , this this is a bit noisy ... but it 's a leaf blower ! ! ! What are you expecting ? Silence ? The nice thing about the noise is that it 's more of a low roar instead of a high-pitched whining sound like my neighbor 's blower ( which drives my wife and me crazy ) . Now ... about the vac feature . If you 're looking for a heavy duty leaf vac/shredder , this ai n't it . It does have a plastic impeller and you have to be careful not to suck up any rocks or thick sticks . In fact , this is my second one of these blowers . I had the first one for three years and had no problems with either the blower or vac part . Then my 10-year-old decided to see if it was powerful enough to suck up a small rock from the garden . Indeed , it was . But the rock broke the plastic impeller , and that was the end of it ( man ... what a horrible sound THAT made ! ) . But is should show you something that I went right to Amazon and ordered the exact same blower to replace it . I may use this one mostly as a blower . I 'll use the vac , but only to suck up stray leaves on the driveway and in hard to reach places . I honestly believe if you 're looking to vac up big piles of leaves , a much more heavy duty piece of equipment is in order . But if you 're looking for an excellent blower at an excellent price , which will do minor vacuuming of leaves , this unit is perfect . You really ca n't beat the price . At under $ 60.00 , I do n't think you 'll find a better made , more powerful , well-built unit . This thing really blows ! ! ! !	1
Here 's some opinions I have after using this blower for a couple of weeks now.1 . The vacuum bag is hard to take off . I seen in another comment that , do not to slip in in all the way . Have n't tried that yet2 . The On/Off knob . Sometimes I found I bumped into it with my hand causing it to move it 's position.3 . I found it easier to let the bag lay on the ground instead of using the strap around the shoulder when vacuuming leaves.4 . The Magnesium Impeller will fit on this unit . I ordered and installed the Magnesium Impeller from Toro model 51598 . ( thanks to Allen who commented about that in his review ) 5 . Would be nice if it had one more lower setting on the blower6 . It 's very light and has plenty of power	1
Received this Toro for Father 's Day and I love it . Sweeping and raking are two of my least favorite yard chores , and this unit has instantly become one of my indispensible tools . Although I was able to vacuum up green hedge trimmings w/o any real problem , I went ahead and ordered the replacement impeller from the heavy duty Ultra model ( they are interchangeable ) , for an additional $ 30 . I was going to mount it right away , but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears , then switch to the magnesium one . It makes sense to do this , as the magnesium impeller is very light , yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra , which helps at the end of the day .	1
Let me keep this short and simple- this sucker blows like a hurricane ! It 's much more powerful than others I have used . The speed adjustment is handily located . And while I 'd never call it `` quiet '' , it 's not as loud as less powerful blowers I have owned . I ca n't comment on the vacuum function as I 've never used it .	1
I use this for a very small lawn . It starts like a breeze and cuts well . It has plenty of power . I got used to dragging the cord pretty easily and that is well worth the trade off for ease of use . The main draw-back is that the handle is wider than the mower so prevents Getty close enough to fences , etc .	1
This Black and Decker has worked well in my father 's tiny 25 ' x 80 ' yard , but I would n't want to use it for a larger area . Here are my observations : Pro -+ Easy to Use ; just plug it in and go+ Quiet ; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight ; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to , but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included ; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting ; like using a vacuum cleaner , you need to be mindful of the cord so you do n't accidentally run it over ( I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass ) Overall , we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
I have had this mower for five seasons so far , during which I typically have to mow twice per week from March through October or even November . In other words , this mower has seen lots of use , and it has n't failed me.There are several reasons I love this mower:1 ) I am allergic to gasoline , so I avoid using it as much as possible . Therefore , it is extraordinarily helpful to have an electric mower that allows me to avoid yard-based gasoline-guzzling & # 34 ; appliances & # 34 ; completely.2 ) It is light-weight , so I can handle it on my own.3 ) The handle easily folds down so it takes up less room in storage during the winter,4 ) Because it is electric , I can flip it upside down to clean it out without worrying about spilling any toxic chemicals.5 ) It does a very good job cutting grass ! This is important in a mower ! It also does a good job mulching grass clippings.6 ) It can handle hills without any issue.7 ) It is easy to adjust the cutting height . In fact , the cutting height can be adjusted with one hand , by moving the handl on the left side of the mower.8 ) It is QUIET ! This mower emits less than half the noise polution that a typical mower emits . I could probably mow very early in the morning and not annoy my neighbors too much . : ) 9 ) It does n't pollute the air the way gas-powered mowers do.10 ) It is easy to start , with no pulling , keys , or other obstacles . Just plug this baby in , pull up on the little orange handle ( on the main handle ) , and mow . That 's it ! Using a cord can be annoying at times , but it is something to which I QUICKLY became accustomed , and I quickly set up my & # 34 ; ballet routine & # 34 ; of mowing while avoiding the cord . It is n't that bad . : )	1
I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it , and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way . But as far as quality , cost ( no gas ) and quick startup , it 's very good . I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time ... .it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again . But it cut well , was very quiet .	1
This is my first electric lawnmower , and so far , I absolutely love it . It is smaller , quieter , lighter , cleaner , and more efficient than your typical gas mower , and there is no risk of throwing out your back trying to start it . It is one of my best buys at Amazon.The mower was shipped in the original box , with the housing nicely supported by cardboard inserts to protect , and minimize vibration . Remarkably , a single strip of clear tape held the cover down . The mower is relatively easy to assemble , and does not require any hand tools . The instruction manual is pretty thorough , except for a couple of parts related to assembly , where a little better description , and larger diagrams would help . Although it is stated in the manual that ` no lubrication is necessary ' , lubricating the bolts on the handle before assembly , and even finished metal parts like the handle , will help deter corrosion . The springs in the power handle and grass guard , would also benefit from spray lubricant.Once assembled , the mower is ready for immediate use . Favoring the right-handed majority , the power switch is on the right side . The motor starts up smoothly , and is relatively quiet , even when running at full power . The whooshing sound generated , probably is n't much louder than a large electric weedwacker . Since the motor is near the ground , and enclosed by a green plastic cover , the sound does n't carry too much . Motor speed can be controlled using the throttle lever , though the mower is designed to be run at full throttle most of the time.The blade height is set using a lever located at the left rear wheel , and is adjustable in approximately half inch increments , from about one inch , to three and a half inches . The motor on this mower is probably not strong enough to cut a heavy lawn with grass higher than say three inches down to the one inch level , without stalling . Running a motor with the rotor locked , is not a good thing , so avoid trying to force your way through tough spots . Cutting narrower strips of lawn is one option . Or you may need to start with the blade at a higher level , and then drop it down to one inch on the second pass . If there are just a few high spots , the old technique of raising the front of the mower , and cutting them down , and then going over the area again , might do the trick . It sounds like a lot of work , but consider that an electric mower is much lighter and easier to maneuver.Grass will collect at the discharge area . The spring-loaded plastic deflector has some deep depressions that get clogged with grass . If you do n't clean the area out it could promote corrosion of the spring . There is a gap between the green plastic outer cover and the metal framing that also gets filled with grass . Perhaps a hard rubber seal in this gap , would be a good idea . In general , the design of this area could be improved.There is a plastic strip at the back of the mower to help block debris that might blow backwards . It is quite soft and flexible , and because it is quite close to the ground , it gets bent around and scraped up . Possibly if it were made of harder plastic , and raised up a bit , it may last longer . The wheels look quite sturdy and durable , and according to the manual , the wheels require no lubrication.Besides the normal safety concerns when using any lawn mower , users of a cord and plug electric mower , need to develop an awareness of , and a system for handling , the power cord . Avoiding any possibility of overrunning the cord should be a primary concern . What is recommended is if possible , mowing outwards from the source of power . That way , you can try and minimize the chances of crossing over the cord while mowing . Running the cord over my right shoulder , keeps it from trailing directly on the ground , and helps me keep track of where the cord is . The mower has provisions for attaching the cord , and when connected properly , there is almost no chance that the cord will become detached.If you have a very large lawn , or one with heavy thick grass , this mower may not have enough power , and you may need to look at one of Black and Decker 's other electrics with more powerful motors . This machine has no problems handling my 2000 square feet of lawn , and I am very pleased with my purchase . Easily five stars for this baby .	1
I bought this product back in 2004 , replacing an older gas mower after my neighors house caught fire from a leaking gas can in his garage . Used the electric mower until 2007 , when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner . I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it . In July 2008 , I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy . Plugged it in , and it started right away , try that with a gas mower . My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn , this mower just gobbles up that lawn . It does bog down in taller/thicker patches , hence only 4 stars . But it gives a nice clean cut . Changing the blade was easy . And it does a nice job of mulching , my lawns look great . I will never own a gas mower !	1
This is truly a good mower . I bought my first Black & Decker electric mower in 1972 and used it as my only mower until 1994 . It received normal use on a normal sized subdivision lot . I absolutely loved it.Then , I moved to places that had much more land and the use of such was impossible . For the last few years , I 've lived where there is a combination of riding mower and walk-behind needed . My gasoline walk-behind developed problems that were going to cost more to fix than it was worth . So , I bought this one.It took just a few minutes to get the mower assembled and the handle adjusted . I sprayed the underside with vegetable oil and started using it . It works great . It is heavy enough to not bounce around on uneven ground , but is light enough to let an old man with back and leg problems to push it around.This has the same problem as the Black & Decker corded tiller - the cheap plastic flip-our power switch and the worthless ( and unusable ) cord minder . Using a 12-3 cord is necessary for the distance I have to go with this and it just wo n't fit into the mower as designed . It also requires holding onto the mower with your right hand 100 % of the time , regardless of the direction being mowed and where the cord is . I 'm working on plans to modify the whole switch/cord thing . What a shame that this needs done.Yes , this is still a 5 star mower . The height adjustment is very easily used . There is ample power . The grass catcher works well , as does the mulching feature . It is a snap to keep clean . And , again , the weight is just right . I really , really like this . It seems that they assigned the mower development to people who knew what they were doing and the switch/cord development to someone who had never used an electric lawn tool .	1
Moving to a smaller property back in 2003 , I found myself no longer needing my riding mower . I looked at several options in the gas mower lineup . After talking to a couple of electric mower owners in my neighborhood , I went shopping at the local hardware store and brought home the earlier version of the Black & Decker MM875 Mower . Like other gas powered tool owners at that time , I seriously had my doubts . That changed after a few weeks use . I 'm very surprised that after eight years , this mower is still up and running.Weighing in at 52 lbs , this 12 amp mower cuts a 19 '' path in no time . With adjustable wheel heights ranging from 1.4 '' to about 3.5 '' , it does a nice job . I like the one touch feature for wheel height adjustment . There 's no fuss and tightness to contend with . I do n't miss the noise of a gas powered motor . Unlike the newer version , my mower has a straight handle bar with a comfortable grip . The start handle is conveniently located on the right side and has a good feel to it . Other then that , there 's really not that much of a change from the original.This mower is light and easy to maneuver around bushes and trees . It does an average job of mulching . Mine came with the side discharge chute . The rear bag that now comes with the newer units was an optional purchase back in 2003 . Even though I do n't use it much , the folding handle is a nice add on for owners with tight spaces . As far as power cords go , I picked up a good 100 foot length 14/3 gauge outdoor extension cord . Its not that hard to manage the extension cord . When using any power tool , its all about staying alert.Like any piece of gear , proper maintenance is paramount . Prior to using this or any mower , its a good idea to coat the undercarriage with a non stick spray . I use the generic grilling spray on mine . I give the blades a good coating too . Since the body is n't metal , I use a rubber spatula to remove any buildup . Afterwards , a good wipe down . Its a good idea to inspect the bolts , nuts and screws for tightness after each use . Just like gas powered mowers , it does take a little bit of effort to remove and replace or sharpen the blade . I always sharpen my blade before the start of the mowing season and every other month . When sharpening the blade I use a fine tooth file . It can be sharpened with a good stone too . I got about 5 years out of one blade.Besides replacing the blade the back flap needed some help too . The original flap lasted me about 7 years and was n't that difficult to remove and replace . Protection wise , Black & Decker offers a two year limited warranty on the mower and a lifetime package on the mower deck . I 've not used their toll free customer support number for the mower , but I have for other Black & Decker products . The customer service that I did receive was outstanding.Overall , I am very satisfied with my Black & Decker mower . It has been a reliable lawn tool that quietly and efficiently gets the job done . With proper maintenance I expect to get another eight more years out of this one . In closing , I can honestly say that I do n't miss my old gas mowers one bit .	1
This mower works great with small lawns that have minimal obstructions between the electric outlet and the desired mowing area . The only way they could make this mower better is if it was push assisted .	1
I 've had this mower now for 3 seasons . And every time I fire it up , I recall the days of having to maintain an internal combustion engine . You do n't have to change oil . You do n't have to check spark plugs . You do n't have to run the mower dry for over wintering . The only real maintenance we 've had done is to sharpen the blades , and we did that last year with no fuss . That 's it . Maintenance is blade sharpening . This saves me time and effort.Then there is the quality of life change as well . No more stinky clothes or hair from spent gasoline . No more deafening roar when I run the engine . Yes , the engine makes noise , but this electric mower must be an order of magnitude quieter . My fiance does n't have to yell at me while mowing if she needs my attention , just speak in a louder voice.The mower is LIGHT . Sure , 50 lbs is unwieldy if you are carrying a package or something , but pushing 50 lbs around your yard ? LIGHT.And then there is the one touch , single point height adjustment . Holy COW , this is just fantastic ! Gone are the days where you have to adjust horrible levers , one per wheel , to get the proper height . Sure , newer mowers offer this capability and are n't corded , but coming from one that had 4 wheel painful adjustment , this is a dream come true.There are downsides to this mower . One is power . 12 amps has been enough , for the most part , to mow our lawn . In deep ( 5 '' ) and wet grass , it starts strong but if you do n't slow down , the engine will work itself to a stall of sorts . This is NO different than what we had with the electric mower though . I ca n't believe just how much power this thing really does have.Another problem is the power cord . First , make sure your house has an external power plug , otherwise you 'll have to fish the extension cords out the window . And that 's where the real annoyance to this mower lies , the power cord . Whereas with a regular mower you can just mow , mow , mow , with this one , you have to mow ... be careful ... mow . The cord will get in your way . The trick is to plan out the mowing in a way that will always keep the cord in the MOWED section of your lawn ( not so easy with the first push , obviously ) . If you do this , cord maintenance is a non-issue mostly . If you have trees in your yard to mow around , this WILL be annoying , no doubt . If that is the case , you may want to invest instead in one with a battery ( this mower does NOT have a battery , it MUST be plugged in ) . Or , if those are n't rated 12 amps or higher for power , I 'd recommend the old standard internal combustion style mower.Highly recommended if you do n't mind power cord maintenance.Pros : Quiet ( compared to regular engine mowers ) No gas smell on clothes , hair , bodyLightPowerfulSingle , easy point to adjust heightCons : CordCordCordCan give impression of not being powerful	1
I originally chose a more expensive knee pad , ignoring these because of the single strap . However , when the ones I ordered did n't work right , I came back to these . The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me . Immediate pain . However , I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee ( which actually pulls the cup into place better ) and even crawling around , the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater , so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them . They fit me nicely , and once I adjusted the strap , very comfortably . The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side .	1
I do a lot of my gardening on my knees as I find it easier on my bad back . Until I purchased Fiskars Kneelers Knee Pads I used a pad that I knelt on . The problem with the pad , of course , is that you have to get up before moving to a new spot . It is much easier to garden with the knee pads attached to your legs . I am very pleased with this purchase.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.The photo shows both sides of the knee pads . The top image shows the outer shell of the pad that touches the ground . It is made out of thick ( slight under 1/2 inch ) rubberized material which provides cushioning and protection from moisture.The bottom image show the inside part of the knee pad , which is made with soft black non-slippery material . The cavity of the knee pad is 4.75 inches wide , and 7 inches long . It can be made more narrow by tightening the knee straps or wider by pressing on it with the knee because it flexes.Each knee pad has a rubber band which holds the knee pad to the leg . Each band is 20 inches long and 1.5 inches wide . At each end of the rubber band there is 3.5 inches of Velcro so you can adjust the pad based on the size of your leg . If your legs are particularly skinny you can sew in additional Velcro strip so you can close it tighter . If your legs are thicker you can add another piece of rubber band with more Velcro . I consider myself an average size woman and I got a perfect fit with and without long pants on.The knee pads are easy to clean by washing them with a hose . They are solidly made and feel like a good quality item.Fiskars offers lifetime warranty for the knee pads . Even if when I do n't plan on using a warranty replacement , it always makes me feel good about a product when the company shows the confidence in the product by offering such long warranty . For warranty service , email warranty @ fiskars.com or call 1-866-348-5661 or contact Fiskars Brands , Inc. 2537 Daniels Street , Madison , WI 53718.I am really enjoying my knee pads , in particular because I can move so much easier with them than a knee pad I used before . I recommend this product.Ali Julia review	1
I should have bought knee pads a long time ago ! I have bony knees , and gardening and housework really bruise them.Now I just strap on the pads and do n't worry about it.The only thing is that the backing on the foam pads is peeling away , a little . So they 're not the sturdiest pads ever . Maybe now that I know I 'll use them often , I 'll buy a higher-end pair and relegate these to the camping bins .	1
This is not what you want for heavy duty wear , like dragging your knees around on concrete all day . These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee : Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden . As a gardener , with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half , these knee pads are perfect . Both my husband and I have a pair . They have a lifetime warranty , too ! I could n't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice , I always choose Fiskars : This brand very seldom disappoints .	1
I bought these for two reasons : 1 - I paint a lot ( walls ) . 2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor ! For the former , they work great- they do n't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders , etc . I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees . It 's great . My knees are n't the best and these help a lot ! For the latter reason , they 're great too ! I can quickly get these on and then let one or two ( or three ! ) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house ! Good excercise and quite tiring ! But for the price - you ca n't go wrong .	1
Bought as a gift and here 's the offial report : 'Great pad cushions and velcro closure . Extremely comfortable . Only hitch : the liners inside start detaching very quickly . 'For under $ 10 they 're worth it .	1
I purchased these to for yard work and now I use them anytime I have to be on the floor or ground working . They have stood up very well and the quality of the product is great . You wo n't be disappointed and your knees will thank you !	1
Received last week . Purchased for gardening , but am using them first to resurface a concrete patio . Lots of knee work . Seconds to fit and very comfortable . After finishing my preliminary work , I went inside to use the computer for an hour . Then , on walking to another part of the house , realized they were still on . That 's comfortable . I 'm average build , male . No problems with the velcro .	1
Overall I am pleased with these knee pads because I can garden without moving a kneeling pad around , I gave this product four stars because depending on the type of pants that I am wearing they either feel too tight on my right leg or too loose . Also if you are working on the ground with a lot of dirt , some of the dirt tends to get inside the knee pads , so sometimes to have to stop to shake it out . I would probably buy this product again .	1
I made the huge mistake of buying a cheap $ 2 trowel from my local HD , of course , it literally snapped at the handle while doing some light digging.The Fiskars trowel on the other hand , is built to last . I could n't really tell from the pictures , but once I inspected and held it , I could feel the quality and after testing it , I noticed a huge difference , the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig , is simply great.What I like the most is the design , the handle is a solid metal piece , thick and extremely durable . It did n't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable . The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really . This is great gardening tool that I 'm sure will last .	1
I use this heavily to till the soil in my flower beds because of its broad shoulders and sharp point . Although its used mostly for troweling , it 's narrow enough to be used for planting and broad enough for transplanting . I have a tool for every job but I find this is the only digging tool I really need to bring along . If you 're debating which type of hand digger to get ( planter , transplanter , troweler , etc . ) , I would stick with this trowelerThe handle is very comfortable , important when jabbing it into the ground repeatedly to loosen the soil . The wooden tools I 've used in the past have been very hard on my hands but , I come away with no pain with this design.The polished alumnium is VERY strong , light weight , mostly scratch resistant and does not rust . The textured material on the handle does collect dirt and has to be scrubbed to get clean .	1
I had one of these trowels before , for about 5 years , before my husband got too heavy handed & snapped it while digging in the garden ! I love it , the soft , rubber handle offers you a good grip while digging.It 's perfect for preparing holes in the earth to plant shrubs .	1
I 'm a beginner gardener even though I 've been a home owner for 11 years . I 've always had a yard guy and never liked it much . I decided to get into it this year and have had a good time cleaning up my backyard . This trowel is lightweight and strong and I would recommend it .	1
This is a good sized , well balanced , very effective trowel . The handle is soft and cleans up easily . It is strong and well put together . Fiskars quality can always be counted on .	1
This is a very convenient way to keep all your gardening tools handy . It 's similar to the bucket tool caddies that contractors used with one key different -- there 's no flap that goes inside the bucket , so it 's possible to use the bucket to carry dirt , weeds , plants , etc . without getting dirt all over the caddy.Construction is decent . I had no problems fitting it to a five gallon bucket , but it 's essential that you find one that does not have a lot of ribs around the lip . The caddy straps on with velcro , and the ribs would make it hard to get a good fit . Thus , buckets you buy at places like Home Depot will not work well - you need an old 5 gallon paint bucket for best results.There are plenty of pockets . The pockets on one side are closed at the bottom ; the pockets on the other are open on the bottom . Chances are you 'll be able to fit all the tools you want to carry . The only problems I encountered were with long handled weeders . I 'll end up carrying them inside the bucket as before.The seed pocket ( sort of like a wallet with cutouts to stash seed packets ) is a nice touch but , alas , one that I ca n't use since I purchase most seeds in bulk bags not envelopes . Wish there was an option to remove that and replace it with a pocket suited for tools , but hey - at this price , I ca n't complain at all.My only concern is construction . While it is decent for the price paid , I expect it will be a bit ragged after significant use . Reenforced seams with rivets would be great - I 'd be willing to pay a bit more for that . A better gripping mechanism would also be a nice touch - perhaps some type of spring clamp that grips the bucket so the burden of holding this on is not born by just a single piece of velcro . Lastly , a built-in sheath for a garden knife would be an excellent addition .	1
I 've used this for around a year now , absolutely love it . I keep getting more gardening tools and have n't ran out of pockets yet . The pockets are all different sizes , some very narrow for something like a pair of scissors or a marker , there is a big one that fits my PH tester perfectly . I also have theCustom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Bucketswhich turns the bucket into a chair and seals the interior if you want a dry spider-free place for gardening gloves .	1
The material is good and easy to clean . Size is perfect , just as described . I have a bunch of Fiskars tools , and now they get perfectly organized and easy to move around . Price was good and deliver was fast .	1
received this yesterday , really nice and well organized . I placed it around an old chlorine bucket and it fits well . compartments for tools are well thought out .	1
Do you find yourself constantly looking for the last hand tool you used when working in the flowerbeds ? Are you forever walking back and forth to get the right tool , or to toss the weeds you just dug up in a lawn bag ? If so , you need a garden caddy , and you could do a lot worse than this model . While it 's not made of heavy-duty canvas like the $ 60 models , it 's strong enough for every day use , and it can last through several buckets . I bought this one for my girlfriend , a passionate gardner , and she 's very pleased with it . Might even get one for myself .	1
This is the greatest thing I have ever found for my yard supplies . I can not imagine working in my flower bed without this product . It fits large buckets without any issues . I keep compost , soil or mulch in the bucket and then have all of my necessary gardening supplies in the caddy . Excellent !	1
This is the finest made caddy I have ever owned . I doubt if I will ever have to buy another . It just does n't seem to wear ! The size differences and set-up are conveniently placed . Construction is heavy duty , well thought out and worthy of all my Fiskars tools . But then it is after all Fiskars .	1
If you 're like me , you tend to set tools down when garderning , go on to another project , and forget where you left your tools . This Caddy is lightweight , with lots of pockets , so it 's easy to pop the tools into a pocket and pick up the caddy and move to a new project . At the end of the day , no running around the yard , trying to find things to put them away .	1
Carrie it in every time i go in my grow room.Always a need to manicure and get all dead and unwanted branchs and leaves ... Has tons of pockets to store whatever i need and my trash bucket.Makes things a lot easier and cleaner love it	1
I am relatively new to gardening and only had 2 old , cheap tools that I used to pot indoor plants . When I started vegetable container gardening , I quickly found that my old tools were not going to cut it , so I got myself a nice set of Fiskars tools . I then needed something to hold them and carry them in when I went back and forth to the garden , so I found this bucket caddy.I already had 5-gallon buckets as that is what I use for container gardening . It is tricky getting the caddy on right the first time . I found it easiest to lift the handle of the bucket up and then put the caddy on , being sure to align the openings on both sides of the caddy with the sides of the bucket where the handle connects . If you do n't do this , you wo n't be able to use the bucket 's handle , which kind of defeats the purpose of being able to carry your tools to the garden ! Even after going through this process a few times , I still have n't mastered it , but I did at least get a tight fit of the caddy 's `` belt '' onto the rim of the bucket . The handle is pretty much locked in the upright position , but that 's okay with me because it makes it easier to grab it and go to the garden.There are loads of pockets of all sizes . They fit everything from my big round composite soil scoop ( Fiskars 7068 Composite Soil Scoop ) to a small pair of scissors I use for opening bags of soil and such . The caddy fits my Fiskars garden tools set plus several extra tools and there is still plenty of room for more.The material the caddy is made from appears quite heavy duty but , since mine is still pretty new , I ca n't speak yet to how well it will hold up over time.You might want to complete your bucket and caddy with a bucket seat ( Custom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Buckets ) , as I did . I had hoped for it to be more flexible for comfort , but it is still great to be able to sit on the bucket and have your tools right under you so you can both reach for whatever you need and also easily put away what you 're done with.Definitely recommend this Garden Bucket Caddy .	1
This is great for me . I can keep all of my garden essentials organized and available . I highly recommend this product .	1
... I thought this was a canvas bucket with a handle and did n't realize it was a canvas wrap around for a 5 gallon 'homer ' bucket , which is not included.Tip for putting it on , unlatch the velcro strap and remove it entirely so you can slip the wrap under the bucket handle , not over it . That might be why some people are having the velcro or seams tear , if you wrap it right around the handle and then raise the handle , that would put more stress on the strap.Once I wound this under the handles as pictured in the amazon image on the product page , rerun the strap and secured the velcro it was snug enough to put a bunch of tools in the pockets . Which are big enough for tools you 'd use to manicure plants , as opposed to hand shovels and the like . Look at the photo and you 'll see some regular standard scissors in one of the pockets , that should give you some scale.So nice that I have a big bucket to put stuff in , not so nice that its really made for rather small tools , not so nice that I had to go buy a bucket but that 's my fault . I own a ton of fiskars stuff and although I know their big business is scissors , I thought I was buying a yard tool caddy and not a scissors holder.I re-purposed it as a sprinkler/irrigation repair bucket , that 's working for me .	1
A not really sure if this attracts mosquitos or if it is the light , but whatever it is it works so I am very happy with my purchase and woul recommend ,	1
Given the price and the length of time these each work ... .you have a 2-3 year supply . Store them in the same box used to store the zapper & # 34 ; off-season & # 34 ; - BUT KEEP THEM IN A LOCATION SAFE FROM CHILDREN .	1
I like the product , the sensor works well the minute it comes in contact with a subject that crosses its path ( that would be me for now ) but it 's hard for me to tell if I am getting results . I live in a wooded area with lots of deer . They come every day and more so at night , so I have n't seen any action yet .	1
Being relatively new to the Austin , Texas , area , we did n't realize that patience plants were salad for the local deer . So , one day we had beautiful , healthy blossoms on our newly planted flowers and the next all we had were stumps and a few small leaves left on each . Talk about being sad ! After a relatively detailed review and possibilities , we decided on the Scarecrow . We ordered one and two days later via Amazon Prime it was assembled , in the ground and hooked up to the hose . Aside from inadvertently squirting myself a couple of times , I got used to sneaking up on it to turn in off in the early AM and on in the PM . After a few days I got the sensitivity right and for a week have not had any problems with deer.Convinced that the Scarecrow was the device for me , I then purchased a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector for the faucet and an Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer . I 'll have reviewed both of these separately.Suffice to say , I am extremely happy with the Scarecrow . It is better than any other device I can think of and , unless it breaks early in its life , will continue to receive a five-star review from me .	1
A family of raccoons had taken up residence in a sheltered area of my house . They demolished a make-shift barricade I previously erected at the entrance . I could hear them scratching and squirming in the little den of theirs , which used to be part of my house . I tried a `` coyote urine '' repellent - without success . I decided to give this Contech ScareCrow a try . I erected it in front of the den entrance and turned it on just before midnight , when I was sure all the raccoons had left their den . An hour later , it fired and I heard the sound of animal running away . All was quiet afterwards . The next day , I spent all day erecting another barricade - a much sturdier one this time , with grade A `` lumber , 1/4 '' steel screws , and `` steel nuts and bolts . I left the ScareCrow where it was , just for good measure . During the week , the Scarecrow fired a couple of times during the night and that was it . The raccoons never returned to attack the barricade again.The nature of and solution to animal problems vary extensively , but for the narrow purpose of keeping raccoons from getting into their den , this Contech ScareCrow passed with flying colors . The whole unit is made of plastic ; it may not last very long under the hot desert sun of the American Southwest , but it did work as it was supposed to right out of the box and setting it up was a breeze . Other reviewers complained about short battery life ; perhaps a lithium 9V battery may help .	1
Cats just love nice soft planting bed dirt . Easy digging , no grass or leaves to work around and often plenty of room so they do n't have to re-visit the same spot . They are indeed tidy animals . After preparing them for this year 's planting , adding all sorts of expensive amendments , every day saw new cat diggings and poop . This year the beds are off limits.Set up the Scarecrow and not one cat visit to report yet . Well , they might of visited , but they did n't stay ! I know it fired off at least once and while the water goes up some and does n't actually hit them , it does make a sudden and fearsome noise and a lot of commotion and they want no part of that.Once I saw a mountain lion paw mark in one of my beds , so if it chases them away that might also be a good thing . Same for raccoons at the fish pond . And it does all this humanely.You do have to be careful to set the sensor low enough for cats and smaller animals . In the past I tilted a Scarecrow down so the sensor picked them up , but for deer or larger dogs you do n't have to . With a raised bed it is easy to set up the height to just above ground level , but for a bed at ground level you might want to try setting it in a pit . You ca n't lean it over because it works by tracking animals walking across its path.It does not work on critters coming straight at or away from it . My outdoor motion lights are like that . You have to spend the time to find out the direction your visitors will travel and make sure they go across its path.The kick of the water will indeed knock it back so that it is pointed upward and this will make it useless . Really , you just have to attach it to a supporting post . I wired mine to the planter walls . I had one once that I put into a pot full of gravel and that did not work . Normal soil will not contain it either.So , spend the time to point it correctly and secure it . I find that going up half-way on the sensitivity works fine . You just have to test your situation ( with the water off ) .You need a 9V battery as it does not ship with one.Years ago I had what seems to be the same device , a gift . It broke and the company would not answer an email about buying the part ( solenoid ) . I hope things have changed and parts will be available . I do not like throwing away a $ 50 item that can be easily fixed.Hecho en China of course . Should be cheaper considering . Lost a star for that .	1
I grow a lot of my own food and I keep a straw mulch of 12 '' on top of the soil . I also have five cats who love to play in the mulch ; moving the mulch around - revealing the seeds to the sun or they go to the bathroom in it . Was looking for an inexpensive way to keep them out . Electric fence will work but is time consuming and somewhat costly..When I put it up , using all the parts , it is way too high to detect cats . Not only that I could n't get the water to spray down where it would actually hit the cats . If you look at the picture above , the spray is `` above '' the cat . That wo n't work with my cats - they 'd just thumb their noses at it and continue on their way . This thing has to soak them or they are n't going to leave the garden . So after fiddling with it for awhile , I finally stuck a piece off of a wooden clothespin in between the dial and the deflector and that got the spray closer to the ground . But the whole thing is still too high.So I checked to see if a 1/2 '' pvc hose thread fitting would work with the Scarecrow fittings and it did so I cut the long extension pipe down to size . But they 've made the pipe itself not a standard size - too big for 1/2 '' pvc , too little for 3/4 '' ( what kind of company does that ? ) . So I sit there and scratch my head - looks like I will have to buy another extension pipe from the company . But as I was walking by I looked at it and thought `` Now why ca n't I just screw the hose into the fitting where the hose attaches , then screw that directly into the motion sensor head.Eureka ! Victory . So now the Scarecrow sits about 6 inches off the ground.However , there is still another problem with the design of this product . The hose attachment piece does not have a swivel . So unless you put a disconnect fitting on it you are going to have to uproot the scarecrow to be able to get the hose off easily.If I were the owner of this company I would include additional length extensions in different lengths and a swivel hose connector . A good idea this product ; but needs more forethought by the designers . Afterall , this product is n't inexpensive really , especially if you need multiple ones .	1
I wish there were ****** six star ratings ! This product deserves at least that many stars ! We received the Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler yesterday and installed it this afternoon .

We bought two of these scarecrows several years ago and have used them continually ever since . Deer are a major problem in this area . Forget deer resistant plants , they will eat almost anything when they are hungry . What they do n't eat , they destroy , pulling it up and spitting it out ! We tried several chemicals including wild animal urine , without success . On the recommendation of a local landscaper we purchased the scarecrows and they really worked ! They protected even the most tender ( delicious ) plants.After the warranty expired , a big buck , escaping the spray , stepped on a scarecrow and broke the spray head . I called the factory , ( phone number and e-mail on the included brochure ) and they promptly sent a reasonably priced replacement.Recently , after six years of use , one unit was still working normally , but the other started spraying with a very small flow . I was prepared to buy a new one as we had several new tender plants that needed protection and I still needed both . However , I first tried again calling the phone number on the brochure , to my surprise it still worked ! I talked with a very polite gentleman who suggested I try disassembling the unit and thoroughly cleaning the parts with a vinegar solution , he would e-mail the instructions . He did , and I cleaned it following the very clear ( with pictures ) instructions . It was n't that hard and the scarecrow worked like new ! The scarecrows were initially expensive , but they are still doing the job and have been well worth the cost .	1
My neighbor 's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows . Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules , citrus sprays , commercial pest repellants , or mothballs . My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations ! The first day it was up & running , the cat came by , got blasted with it twice from about 15 ' away , and ran away scared to death - and I have n't seen him in my yard since ! Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it 's on and walk into my back yard , but it 's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good . I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem !	1
There is a cat in our neighborhood that used to spend most of his day in my backyard hiding near my birdfeeders . Before I got five of these sprinklers , he was killing several birds a day . In the seven months I 've had the rainbirds scattered around my backyard , he has n't had a successful hunt . Nor has he been able to spend enough time in my backyard to leave presents for my dog to find . The sprinklers do not react to birds , but the cat has n't figured out a way to avoid them . Each time he moves out from under a bush , he gets blasted by a rainbird . He jumps the fence and runs away only to return the next day hoping for a different outcome . When I first installed them I had a problem with leaks , but after wrapping the connectors with plumbers tape , there have been no drips whatsoever . I like that the water jet can be aimed high or low , so my windows remain dry when the sprinkler goes off . The water jet is pretty powerful and very loud , so be sure to direct each rainbird so you can sneak up behind it to turn it off . Even when the water is turned off at the spigot , enough remains in the hose to give you a good soaking . Embarrassing to admit , but both my gardener and I have been sprayed more than once . This is a solid 5-star product , but you 'll need more than one .	1
I have many fruiting trees that must be protected by birds and squirrels . This motion sensor product is a great item to thwart those pesky birds from eating my persimmons , cherries , and other fruiting trees.A relative has a motion sensor device to protect koi from predator birds . Sometimes those little birdies want a fish or fruit meal ; however , motion sensor instruments are a tremendous method of eluding their dietary desires .	1
I bought this to keep coons away from my fish pond and it works great . A must have is you have a pond .	1
I would have given this five stars but the connections loosen with use and I have had to hand tighten the connection right beneath the scarecrow head a couple of times . I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond . I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel 's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller . They work in unison and are effective ! I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter . Everything has remained undisturbed . And , I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and ( to me ) less obtrusive . This was a great investment .	1
I bought this unit last summer to deter cats from attacking the birds in my back yard . I have several feeders in my yard , and in the summertime when the bushes and ground cover is heavy , several cats in the neighborhood hide in the brush and very often leap out and nail birds that are ground feeding . I ca n't tell you how many times I have gone out there some time during the day to see a pile of feathers on the ground . Sometimes I am fortunate enough to catch them hiding and I chase them off . But I ca n't be back there all the time . Both me and the birds were losing the battle big time for a while . I even resorted once to laying down one of those sprinkler hoses and leaving it on low all the time . But that was wasteful and expensive ... This sprinkler thingy has been a Godsend to me and the birds . It 's so easy to hook up . You just put a battery in it , attach a hose to it and stick it in the ground . Its that simple . I bought two of them for the bushes on each side of my fence and installed a Y connector in the hose so it can deliver water both ways . It takes a while to get the sensitivity just right , but then its just sit back and watch it patrol the grounds for you . Since I have had it installed I have not seen the remains of a single victim . And the burst of water that is left behind is useful to the birds and harmless to the cats . It 's true that you have to have a hose running across your yard for it to work , but that is a minor irritation for what you get out of it as far as service for sure . When I first installed it I saw the area wet all the time as the cats were taking their chances with it . Now its less and less being used as they have become wise to it and moved on to other game somewhere else . It 's true that the battery does n't last as long as one would want , but I really do n't mind it . I just change it at the beginning of the month from late spring through September whether it needs it or not and its up and working without interruption.In conclusion , this is one of the cheapest , if not the cheapest form of motion detector sprinkler I have found on Amazon . It installs in a jiffy , works perfectly for me , and seems very well made . I ca n't attest to its durability yet , but for the price and performance I highly recommend it . Great product.. : )	1
This product not only works well , but it 's also fun to watch ! ! , especially when rabbits , cats , or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass , this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape ! ! I love watching this in the early moring hours . Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them , this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property . Have fun watching ! !	1
This is the ONE thing that actually kept the deer out of our garden all last Summer . All of the various repellents , sprays , dangly-things , and even electric fencing , only held Bambi and Bambi 's mother off for a week at best , then they would either get used to them or ( in the case of fences ) just jump over them.They ca n't seem to get used to this Scarecrow though - I guess it 's just too unpredictable for them . It held them off all season and I actually got veggies from my garden , whereas my neighbors got nothing but deer-droppings.So I 'm here to order another this year , to protect my flower garden as well . ( I 'm also considering using one to ward off pumpkin-stealing pranksters at Hallowe'en - that ought to be a good `` treat '' ! ) Oh , yah- that reminds me : do n't set this device up where the mailman has to cross its path . Mail carriers can get a little grumpy about being squirted with water out of the blue - go figure ... : ) -- - Just editing this a year later to add : Not only is it still working ( imagine that : getting an electronic product out of the potting shed after winter is over , putting in new batteries , and it STILL WORKS ! ) but the deer are also still completely put off by it . Ca n't ask for better than that !	1
I tried everything for my vegetable garden including fencing , electric fencing , solar vibration but this is the only product that actually worked . I have deer , chipmunk , turkey , and the most annoying , ground hogs . This works for all of them . Just set the sensitivity to the right setting . Do n't jack up the setting too high , otherwise , it 'll go off a lot . Not sure why other reviews say the battery runs out fast which I was worried about but I 've had it going for about a month with the product going off several times a day without any issues with the battery . Perhaps they jacked up the sensitivity to the top . The only downside is based on the size or layout , you may need to get several of these to keep out the animals . I have a garden about 50 x 20 with 2 tiers and tall plants so I needed at least 4 to get a good coverage . Amazon has the best price so get what you need for your garden and keep those pesky animals away !	1
I was skeptical that this scarecrow would deter the deer in my yard . I 'm very glad that it exceeds expectations ! I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end . Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week , followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer . For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet -- as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year . So glad to finally see some perennials that I have n't seen in five years . I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works . If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try . If only there was something for winter ( besides deer netting ) .	1
my many times getting wet testing this thing proves that it works . I would buy this again if I ever need another one .	1
The second unit has worked very well . We had a family of foxes take roost near a creek in the neighborhood . Each night very late we could hear a fox making a weird noise near our house , I guess as it strolled by . Well , this took care of it . After about 10 days , we shut it off and we 're guessing the fox changed its route due to this device . Seems well made .	1
I have 3 each scarecrows and it does work . I used to have cats come into my yard and do there business and not any more . I have even sprayed people with the scarecrow when the walk within range of the motion detector .	1
Well , I am very glad I made this purchase . This unit works very well , gosh it does scare the animals away . I now have no dug out holes in my garden and my vegetables are undisturbed .	1
We live in the desert so not many people have grass in their yards , however we do . Because of this we attract colonies of rabbits and they are killing our yard and eating everything I try grow . I recently planted some clover seed to fill in the patches of grass their urine has killed , but the whole task would be useless had I not found the Scarecrow sprinkler . I 'm happy to report this has almost completely solved our problem . We have been keeping the sprinkler pointed towards the section we are repairing and the clovers are coming in undisturbed . However , there are blind spots as the sprinler can not see off to the sides very well . Now the rabbits are hanging around the other half of our yard . Solution- we will definately be getting another one of these for the other half . One annoying thing about the Scarecrow is they didnt include a ring to were you attach the hose to make attaching and unscrewing easier ; you have to twist the entire sprinkler around making lining up the threads kind of a pain . Regardless this is has been the best rabbit repellent I could find . I highly recommend the Scarecrow !	1
I have one already and they work great to chase those pesky critters away from trees that have fruit ! they work super and seem to be the only thing that works , powders and sents do n't seem the work !	1
I have met the Saint Simons deer . Well , we & # 8217 ; ve not been formally introduced or anything , but I have seen their handiwork . We had just moved and all my plants were waiting for me to transplant them . My strawberry plants were gone first . Then it was the best parts of the blueberry bushes . But it was the sweet potato vine in the pot near the porch that was my call to action . I purchased one of these Scarecrow motion sensor sprinklers that will scare the deer away and installed it a few weeks ago . Although I & # 8217 ; ve never seen it in action , I know it works.While I was out of town moving the family down , there was some work being done at the house . I was texting with one of the folks working around noon one day and I mentioned the sprinkler as a warning . Shortly thereafter I received the following text from another worker , who was also at the house helping : & # 8220 ; Hello Tom . Thank you for the warning about the sprinkler . I don & # 8217 ; t know about deer , but it seems to work fine on me , the carpet cleaner , and the landscape crew. & # 8221 ; That & # 8217 ; s how I knew it worked at first.But , as it turns out , it 's not just great on contractors ! It also keeps the deer away . After installing it , I noticed no further damage except when I would forget to turn it on . I use a timer with it so that it does not spray our dogs during the day . I 've been using it for several months now and it still works perfectly . I would recommend this as a non-chemical , low cost way to keep the deer from eating your plants . ... and as I learned it can keep people off your yard too !	1
Like others , we 've had a problem with obnoxious pests visiting our yard late at night . The Contech Scarecrow worked really well the first time , but the vermin rapidly adapted and learned to avoid the covered region ( front yard plus bedroom window ) . Even moving the Scarecrow around only worked the first couple of times . I 've decided to use rose bushes and transplanted poison ivy as a more permanent deterrent .	1
My daughter gave me the scarecrow years ago and it sat in my garage until a few weeks ago . I am currently replacing her rear yard fence and her idiot neighbor has a dog that started coming into her yard and relieving himself on her grass . Needless to say this women is a real jerk who takes no responsibility for her kids or pets . I remembered having the scarecrow and immediately put it in her rear yard . It has worked flawlessly keeping the little monsters , both canine and human on their own property . Her other neighbors asked me about the motion activated sprinkler , they are also having problems with the kids and dog and are now getting their own .	1
I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden . I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1 . Light in weight2 . Easy to operate3 . Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4 . InexpensiveThis trimmer met all my requirement perfectly . I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes , it works well in small places , and it gets all the grass in one pass . After two summers I am still using the original string , and did not need to replace it so far.Note : this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review	1
This little trimmer does the trick with a lot less trouble with handling and is easy on my back . It is a powerful little trimmer .	1
We always seek a good way to clean and trim those ugly weeds , this Trimmer does the job smartly and efficently . There is nothing you ca n't do without a good weed trimmer .	1
This tool works very well . And at this price , it is a no brainer . I use this on my St. Augustine grass and it cuts it close . I love the bump feature to release more string . It is also very light and quiet.Just buy an appropriate extension cord and you are good to go . Nothing to charge and it does not use gas , so it does no pollute .	1
This weedeater is light and cheap and meant to do one thing : edge lawns . If you 're looking for a device to do a finishing touch on your lawn , this is a smart approach . Sadly , most of us lack the discipline to use such specialized tools for their best purpose , so do n't get adventurous and simply finish off your lawnwork with the craftsman 's tool for lawns .	1
This product was lightweight and easy to use . Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back . It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming ; however , it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds . I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product . I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all , this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right . My husband loved it .	1
I just got this tiny machine home to Japan in my luggage and tried it out . Yes , it is underpowered , but that could also have to do with the 100-volt supply here . But that said it does exactly what I need it for , to trim edges where my mower ca n't reach . It is not really too short for me , and I can swing it like a one-handed scythe because it is so light.I was totally disgusted with my much more expensive Makita that would never feed the line properly , so I feel the Black and Decker is worth $ 19.95 for every time I do n't need to swear and pull the Makita reel apart to rewind it ! Four years later -- -- - it 's still working ! The motor seems to slow down now and then , and the blade that cuts the extended line got loose and then lost , but it still trims just as I need it to do . I got a second unit for the US place last year and it has a better designed handle and faster spinning motor . The `` bump '' line feed in the old one still works most of the time , and I fixed the blade problem by cementing a box cutter blade on the housing . The spool is easily rewound with standard line . No real complaints !	1
After an outbreak of pantry moths I was ready to scream . I tried lots of solutions but none as satisfying as this gadget . The little devils are hard to kill . One will all of a sudden appear , fluttering across the room , and if you 're not quick , it will disappear again just as fast . Sometimes you can clap your hands over it to kill it and I 've even used a butterfly net , but you ca n't swat them like you would a fly because when they land they 're pretty much invisible . You have to get them in the air . I was willing to try any harebrained thing -- which I thought this was -- but voila ! It zaps the little suckers very effectively.Since you have to grab it fast and have it right way up in order to depress both the buttons to activate it , I put a sign on the 'up ' side since it is otherwise not easy to tell . Once in hand of course , it can be used repeatedly and quickly and is great when sitting out on the deck . It has made summer evenings much more pleasant . I really do n't want a big zapping machine making noise so this really fills the bill for me . I 've used it a lot in the last year but have n't had to change the batteries yet.When my adult daughter was sitting on the deck one night and came in looking for the bug spray , I gave her this gadget . She was super impressed and bought one herself.If you hit a damp object or a big bug , there is a rather loud spark and sizzle so you have to be prepared to deal with that , but it absolutely works .	1
This zapper is more of a toy for any age rather than just a boring and not always very successful bug swatter.When we got this in we absolutely loved the whole box design they 've done a great job and have brought the concept `` alive '' before you even start playing with it . Packaging like this in totally lost now-a-days for everyday items like a `` bug swatter '' and we were just taken a back all the detail and thought that went into creating this ! Now for this super cool zapper ... .Where can i start ? ! This thing can fascinate anyone but especially boys/men : the difference between boys and men is just the price of their toys..lol.. ; ) ..NO offense to anyone . Anyhow i got away cheaply with this one i guess for once ! The bigger bugs are definitely much `` funner '' to watch because there is more action once they hit the racket but nothing gets away from this thing.This thing could even been used to blow off steam after a bad day just switch the light on at night and go outside and go at it like there is no tomorrow ! The bugs are not going to stop coming as long as the light is on and you will definitely get a workout with all the swinging ... ; ) I 've ordered plenty more gifts and just to have in the house for when people come over and want one because this is definitely going to be the summer accessory find for this year ! BUY ONE AND HAVE FUN ! ! !	1
This item and similar products are usually marketed as novelties , but I have found mine to be an indispensable tool . That 's because your basic flyswatter is incomplete since it requires a nearby flat `` killing surface '' to get the job done ; if the flying bug in question refuses to cooperate by landing on or flying slowly near such a killing surface , a flyswatter is useless.On the other hand this tool can take care of insect pests flying in the middle of the room , next to things that can not safely be swatted , or outdoors . This particular model has a couple of buttons that must be pressed and held down simultaneously ( by thumb and forefinger ) in order to charge , which happens almost instantaneously , and a red LED to let you know it is ready , all of which contribute to extending battery life . Despite my son 's bug hunting safaris , I 'm still on my first set of two AA batteries . Use is basically the opposite of a flyswatter : move it slowly until the grid touches the insect pest ( there will usually be a visible flash ) . Cleanup in most cases involves wiping with a tissue.Obviously , the larger the bug , the less likely you will kill it outright with the first charge , but at the very least this thing will knock it to the ground . I would not advise seeking out combat with a swarm of hornets , but this tool would be about the only effective response in addition to running for cover . Which product you choose is up to you ; my buying decision was made for me by a combination of sale , coupon , and discount that reduced the cost of this item to zero .	1
Have had for 10 months now on same set of batteries and the zap still feels as strong as ever . If you swat a fly out of the air it will usually just injure it and you will find it bouncing around on the floor . It 's actually pretty easy to trap them under the swatter by just lowering it down over the fly , kills em pretty quickly this way . You 'd think they 'd sense it quicker and move but maybe the wire netting allows the air flow through enough that they 're not alerted . Anyway , it 's fun to see the little spark when you get them . We 've kept one in the kitchen and going to buy one for the RV now . Do n't let the kids play with this , it 's actually a pretty strong zap . It is fun , however , to play with it yourself and zap the kids ! And zap the friends and the spouse . Yeah , everyone loves it ! ; ) Oh yeah , the case is nice too . We hung it up near the kitchen as a holder for the swatter and it 's been there since we 've had it with no tears . Seems a lot cleaner than having a regular fly swatter out .	1
I hate to think of myself as having fun at some other creature 's expense but - BWAHAHAHA , bite THIS , you bloodsucking fiends ! ! I first saw this being used on a vacation to St. John . The employees in the cantina each had one , and were waving them around slowly in front of their faces , almost in a hypnotic way . Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes , according to these folks ( who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways ! ) If you try to swat at them too fast you will just blow them away , but if you move the paddle around slowly they will just fly right into it and go sizzle sizzle sizzle ... ! ; ^ ) Heed what everyone says though : do n't hit yourself with it while the buttons are pressed , and do n't let kids `` play '' with it . It can give you a nasty burn .	1
**Update February 2013** I 've had this racket for 5 years and it 's still functioning as it should . I change the batteries maybe once a year , and I rate this as one of my best purchases ever . My husband likes it too because with this racket I can tackle the spiders in our house on my own . Very happy , especially considering the inexpensive price . **Original review**I live on a couple acres in the woods , complete with creek . My targets include gnats , mosquitoes , flies , moths , spiders , and perhaps the occasional wasp . Gnats are vaporized , moths give a gratifying spark and perhaps a wisp of smoke when they hit the racket , and dead mosquitoes get stuck to the racket but are easily shaken off.A few nights ago , a big housefly got inside our home and I grabbed the racket to take care of him . He flew into the racket as I held it over him near the window and zapped him easily . This morning , I accidently let in a huge moth that promptly headed for the nearest lamp . I carefully stuck the racket under the lampshade , and the moth flew right into it . I ca n't imagine how difficult it would have been otherwise to get rid of that fly and moth without the racket.I love this racket for taking care of spiders too ! The only negative I 've noticed is that when I 'm wildly swinging this zapper around to see how many gnats I can kill , the battery cover slides a little . Not a big deal to me . If I 'm not swinging it wildly , the battery cover does n't budge.I picked this bug zapper over the other oh-so-similar racket zappers available because this one only has horizontal zapper wires in the racket area ... .. no protective mesh that might interfere with eliminating pesky bugs . **Update** August 2009 : I 've owned this racket for over 18 months now with frequent use , and someone requested a specific update about a couple of common problems with this racket , so here it is ! Regarding having to press on two buttons to use this racket , I 'm glad of this feature because it reduces the likelihood of it bumping up against something in storage and accidentally being turned on . The buttons are staggered on each side of the handle so that my thumb is on the upper button , and my index finger is on the lower button . I have to take 1/2 a second to make sure my fingers are in the right place and the little LED light is on and working , but it does n't bother me . The buttons are a safety feature and I 'm willing to work with them . Regarding the battery cover , it sometimes slides about 1/2 '' , but it has never slid off completely so I do n't worry about it . I 'm STILL on the original set of batteries this zapper came with . : ) If this racket zapper ever stops working perfectly , I 'll update , but so far it really has exceeded expectations .	1
I 'm glad this gadget came with two double A batteries , I could test it right away ! Shaped like a smallish tennis racket , the Amazing Bug Zapper does kill any bug it makes contact with , but you have to tap the bug first ! It works fine with larger bugs like wasps , and other slow , flying insects , but the item is fairly bulkly and hard to handle for fast , small bugs . In the south , I need an entire bodysuit made of Amazing Bug Zapper fabric !	1
Really , this is a very effective means of pest control . The safety feature of having two buttons pressed in order to activate it , and having them displaces so you dont accidentally turn it on is nice . When you strike , you get a big blue jolt , which from my experience , makes it fun for the kiddos . Also , i touched the racket while it was on ... .the current is definitely pretty strong . It wont kill a person , but it does hurt , which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much , much smaller insects . They dont always die first zap , but it always stuns them at the least , allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit.A good way to spend $ 10 IMO .	1
Zap , sizzle , fry , flyGo up in a plume of smokePaddle bids you 'Die ! '	1
This compost starter really speeds things up . I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves , branches and the like . Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days , I am already seeing progress . Despite a cold snap , the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag . There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process . Recommended .	1
Waiting for the yard waste to break down normally takes a while on average , but three days ago I spread a layer of Ringer 3050 compost plus on my compost pile , watered well and forgot about it , thinking it would take time to start the magic of Ringer 3050 Compost.. this morning as I passed the containing , knowing that in Arizona 's heat it might need watering . One day after applying ... What a surprise I found ... you could see that the pellets had already broken down and a richlooking yard waste was well on its way to rich compost , I turned it over , deeper this time and again placed a layer of pellets , closed the top , This watering and turning and placing the pellets has been around 12 days now and 3/4 of the container has a very black compost , really black . What is really great there is no odor , Amazing stuff , The packaging comes in a 2 pound box , it took very little of the pellets to start and to keep activation . Very , very pleased with this product.Now , the only thing to await is to see how well the fruits and flowers react to this rich mixture.Here in the desert a heavy loam clay is about all there is , so a rich compost that has a rich black color is a delight , Happy with this product and will be sure to keep a box available . Recommend this for 5 stars .	1
I use a tumbler that I rotate every few days . I sprinkled a cup of this into the compost that was already in there , with some fresh vegetable skins dropped into it , and within a few days there was a noticeable increase in the matter , with a black , rich compost all around.Now mind you , I live in southern Arizona and we already get the hot , dry heat this time of year . I do n't plant my summer garden until the monsoons hit in July . By then this compost will be ready . I can actually use what is in the tumbler now for my growing tomatoes . I keep the compost damp and turn the tumbler regularly . The outside heat helps keep the matter hot.One thing I noticed when I first used this on my compost is that the bugs that were already in the tumbler scrambled . Apparently even beetles and roaches give way to this stuff . And that is a good sign .	1
I bought a rotating composter last summer . It took all summer to turn my yard waste into compost . Actually , by the end of the last summer , while the compost was almost done , it was too late in the season for me to use so I just left it in the composter . This spring I had great compost . That 's almost a year for that batch . This year I am hoping to speed things up a little.This product contains the microorganisms to get things started quickly . I added this product to my yard waste a few weeks ago . I have already noticed an improvement on the progress of the compost process compared to last year . Hopefully I will have usable compost ready to spread in the garden by the end of summer .	1
I 'm actually using a 55 gallon compost tumbler , rather than a heap . My compost contents were moving along rather slowly the last couple months , so I added 2 cups of this to the compost , aerated it each day , and within 2 or 3 days the compost was noticeably more composted ! Now , 2 weeks later ( and after tumbling the compost daily ) , the compost is nearly ready to use . Awesome product ! Glad the box still has lots left to use in the future !	1
So , I got the compost in the mail . I opened the box , and the composts were all over the place . Good thing that they put the box inside a ziplock bag . If they did n't put the box inside ziplock bag , i 'm sure it would be one messy box . Anyways , other than that , it expedite the compost process . Good thing to have in the yard .	1
We added this to our compost tumbler and it seems to be helping break down the material we put inside ( yard waste , food , etc . ) As another review noted , the box did not hold the contents inside . It seems like the manufacturer/distributor knows this because the box was sent inside a plastic bag which caught all of the grains that had fallen out .	1
Ringer Compost Plus is an excellent supplement to kick start a compost pile . It works with either an open pile or compost apparatus.Composting is not terribly complicated , get the right nutrients ( yard waste ) , the right amount of water , the right temperature , the right amount of air , and the right bacteria ; and that yard waste will decompose to something wonderful for your garden . The scary part with composting , if a few of those elements are off , the compost pile ends up smelling really bad . This ringer product helps get the bacteria side of the equation working right . You still have to water the pile during dry periods , aerate the pile , and add material to the top . It is n't a magic wand that takes the every other day tending out of the equation.The bacteria that decompose yard waste are already present in those leaves , grass clippings , and wood chips . It is just at a very low level . Ringer Compost Plus boosts the bacteria count quickly and gets the compost pile working much faster than if left to its own devices . In theory , applying this once should do the job , just like sourdough bread . In practice , I end up getting lazy with my compost pile and let things run crazy . Ringer 's bacteria are also chosen to work at higher temperatures , meaning the compost pile will decompose quicker.Ringer 's yard products are amazing . I 've used their Lawn Restore fertilizer for a long time . Unlike synthetic fertilizers with really high nitrogen and phosphorus levels , this is a gentle fertilizer . I 'd have to work hard to get my lawn to stripe or look uneven from this fertilizer . There is also a blend of bacteria in the fertilizer that makes my lawn a lot healthier . The product is organic , but that 's not why I buy it . It just makes my lawn look great in a gentle way . Their Compost Plus has n't changed a lot over the years either . It is the old reliable product it always was . Ringer products are not easy to find - the fertilizer is very expensive to order on line . Safer Brand is the main company . I 've seen their products in Do It Better and Ace Hardware stores . I have n't seen it in the big box home repair centers.Compost Plus is a great way to get that compost pile working .	1
It can be quite hard to get a compost pile going . We have tried a couple different ways and could n't really get what you are suppose to get from a compost pile , we would always end up with just garbage and flies . We researched online and watched a lot of videos . It has to have a certain mixture of types of things that you add . We had way too much household food in ours . We also decided to forgo our compost bin and decided to go with a tumbler composter after a couple failed attempts in our bin.This Ringer Compost Plus helps get your compost going . We are now having much better luck . I suggest doing some research yourself if you are just beginning . There is more to composting than just throwing your scraps and coffee grounds into a bin.Spring is the perfect time to start and the Compost Plus gives it a head start .	1
I have a classic-style composter with the doors on the bottom and a compost starter really is an excellent way to boost the breakdown process . If you do n't have a tumbling composter you might want to add aYard Butler Compost Turnerto your list . Anyone who has been composting for a while would recommend a starter , especially if you are mixing everything in your bin from food scraps to wood chips . No , composting does n't happen overnight and everyone will learn about composting as they gain more experience.There are several `` recipes '' you can scout out on the Internet when you are going to make your compost . For example , one common one is one part food scraps , one part grass clippings , and two parts dry leaves . Ringer Compost Plus has has directions on the box that are quite useful to those just starting out . There is a brief vignette on troubleshooting that is helpful . For example , if you have a smelly pile they have a very helpful hint on how to minimize the odor . Only complaint I have is that I would have preferred a resealable bag over a box . Other than that , I 'm all for compost makers to jumpstart the composting process .	1
I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year . Our city recently changed the trash system and I 'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I 've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps , brown and green matter . It seems to be speeding up the process , but it 's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I 'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product . If it speeds up the process , I 'll be purchasing more .	1
I have started this in my compost turner- I live in Florida ... I will come back and post how the compost turns out ... really great idea , the instructions are clear and it was easy to use ... I might also add no fowl smell	1
This product works and is less expensive that other brands we have tried . So this has been our brand-of-choice for a while now . When growing compost , you have to be serious : About your ingredient mix and about turning and churning up your mix . You have to be patient , too ! We are diligent about our composting : We have 1 1/2 acres of manicured lawn , many gardens , many trees and bushes and a free-range chicken yard . So we need a lot of compost and we generate a lot of compost material . We use a double-barrel Mantis for our composting : It makes the turning and churning a breeze . But we really need to make a lot of compost to capitalize on the Mantis investment.Even with all the great compost material we generate , we still need an accelerator every once in a while -- especially during colder months . And then sometimes our mix of `` green '' and `` brown '' material is not quite right . Sometimes we just want compost fast -- well , at least faster than its normal slow-but-sure progress . We always have a box of this stuff on hand.Just an extra thought that may prompt someone to get into composting : Even with our Mantis compost-maker , we still have compost makin 's left over . So we bought a roll of plastic fencing and made a triangle using the fencing on the inside corner of a chain link fence . We dump our grass clippings and leaves into this simply-made 8'x8'x8 ' triangle . When we first dumped a partial box of this Ringer compost-maker onto our 5 ' tall pile , it fell 1 1/2 ' within a week . So , do not doubt that it works . Also , you can simplify your composting efforts -- it 's not the most efficient way to go , but it is better than no composting at all .	1
I 've always had a compost pile in the back corner of my yard and since I grow most of my own produce , it comes in handy to fill raised beds ( certainly cheaper and better than buying soil ) and to top-dress beds . The thing that convinced me to try this produce was that it is a 100 % natural product and , as much as possible , I like to keep an organic garden . As an aside , I read Mike McGroatry 's blog/website a lotEasy Plant Propagationand agree with him that compost is n't complicated -- it 's what nature wants to do with a pile of clippings . The best thing you can do is just get out of the way and let nature take her course . But you have to be patient ( not one of my more stellar qualities ) .The problem I 've had is that while I do get great compost/soil from the pile over the course of a summer , it 's a slow process . With that in mind I decided to try this product . ( I also thought of buying one of those tumbling things , but have you seen how much they cost ? ) I tried the product today . The instructions call for sprinkling about a cup on a pile that 's about 3 x 4 ' and about 12 '' deep . I had a freshly stacked pile of materials ( both green and brown materials ) that was about that size and 3 ' tall already , so what I did was spread it out and and then re-piled it but added a cup of the Compost Plus for every 12 '' depth or so . I watered each layer ( as per instructions ) as I re-stacked the composting materials and built the pile back up to its original height . This sounds complicated , but it took all of 10 minutes . I just used a pitchfork and it was very easy work.I wo n't know for a month or so if this is any faster , but I 'm hoping to see some evidence ( heat perhaps ) that this stuff is speeding up the process . I may even be able to tell sooner than that . One thing I got from the packaging was that it 's important to have a good level of moisture in your compost pile -- not too wet , but certainly not dry . I have been remiss in that -- again , I just let the rain water it normally . I will try to be more careful about keeping this pile wet to give the product a fair chance . If it works and speeds up the process , I 'll be thrilled . I 'm reading a lot lately about the value of microorganisms in soil ( and reading a lot about no till gardening ) Plowman 's Follyand that is what this product is : a mix of select microorganisms.I will update this review in a few weeks and report back on how its working . My only negative thought now is that it took most of the 2 lb box to do the pile ( again , 3 x 4 ' ) and so adding this stuff regularly adds another expense to the garden.Update 5/09/2013 : It 's only been a few weeks since I first applied this stuff to my compost pile and while I do n't feel the `` heat '' that I was half expecting , I will say that the pile seems to be composting faster than normal . I 'm seeing a significantly faster conversion to compost in the center of the pile . Not a miracle , but noticeable .	1
I love composting ; it makes me feel like I 'm doing my part to keep valuable plant nutrients in the ecosystem , and waste out of the landfills . And it 's super easy to do when you break it down into the basics : heap up food and yard waste , and let it rot . Then you wait , sometimes for a year , for your compost.This product speeds up the process a little bit . It has a mild manure smell that did not bother me when I was storing it in the garage before use , but the smell did bother my nose-sensitive mother , who wanted to know what 'that stink ' was . So for storing inside , be aware others might find the scent offensive . I 'd suggest just using it right away . : ) The pellets are really just a kickstarter product , with enzymes and flora to make the compost process hotter more quickly . If you 've never composted before , this is a great way to get some quicker compost bang for your buck.It 's also fun to use , making the process more like cooking . If you really want to learn how to compost well , read Let It Rot , or find a website on composting . Even with a starter batch like this , composting still takes time and patience.NOTE : Some of my pellets arrived sifted out from the box . It was a bit messy .	1
... because my compost bin smells to high heaven . I put in leaves , some small sticks , grass , some banana peels , and egg shells . I layered this in between . I 'd say it took 2 weeks to get a good smell going ... might be ready to use in a few more .	1
I 've been working on a compost bin for about a year now , and noticed lately that it was n't heating up as much as it had in the beginning . When I received the RINGER COMPOST PLUS I added about half the box to my current compost pile ( a turning drum style ) and by the next day found that the head had returned which means the composting process is back in full swing . My ONLY complaint , and it 's minor , is the smell ( ! ) of the contents of the box ! You certainly do n't want to store it in your home or even in your garage - it 's THAT strong . I wrapped mine in plastic to keep it dry and tucked it under a sheltered area near the garden . But hey ... smell or no smell , this stuff works !	1
Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do . I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it 'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker , it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings , leaves , and other lawn debris to start a compost pile . The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up ' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I 'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked . Until then , though , it has gotten me started on composting .	1
But it does seem to work . Added it to a mix of green and brown compost , with an approximate ratio of 1:2 , and the mix is warm and decomposing . Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate , or perhaps jump-start your compost . If the bacteria are already around , as they would be most places , this product is n't strictly necessary , but could help out with the compost . Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison . if you 're in a rush though , it 's likely to help out .	1
I have been making compost for several years now . I have a compost tumbler with a crank handle that rotates it . I started a batch in late winter and was having a hard time getting it to heat up . This compost starter did a great job of really getting it going . If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio . Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green . In the summer when I am composting mostly greens , then this starter is pretty much unnecessary . I save some of the finished compost from each batch to start the new batch with . If you are doing a passive pile then this stuff is even more of a help because you can add it to each new layer as you build the pile .	1
I have a compost bin ( two actually ) and ca n't wait to use it in my garden this year ! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better , richer , darker . I love this product ! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost . What ? ? ! ! Does n't everyone add paper ? Well , I called the company and after a few passes around the office , I was told , then confirmed by another employee , that they do n't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and should n't use in composting . So , they just wrote 'no paper ' on their box . Easier for them I suppose , but I 'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine . Hope this helps ! Happy composting !

I will have to review this product at the end of the summer to give a better idea of the help/quality of the product . My first impressions were that this was a small amount of stuff . I also think that it stinks . I am going to use it in a compost bin , rather than the recommended ground idea . I do n't like to leave compost on the ground , as it attracts rodents . So far my stuff has been in there for three weeks . Will update again later .	1
It 's hard to imagine any soil worse than the native soil in my garden and my yard . Here in Texas , we call it caliche , and you truly could use it as clay on a potter 's wheel . That 's why I 've been composting veggie scraps and yard trimmings . The compost that results helps the garden ( and increases the worms ) . My problem has been that composting is slow . This Ringer Compost Plus helps speed the process , so I can build soil that will nourish my plants.I have not measured the temperature in my composter , but in spite of the fact that our weather has been much cooler than normal , the material I put in the composter a month ago has been turning into soil quite nicely . Ringer says to expect composting to complete in 60 to 90 days , but I 'm seeing results much sooner than that . I 'm ready to turn out my first batch of the year tomorrow.In addition to working quickly , this product is a bargain , costing about half of the compost starter I had been using.If you have an interest in improving your soil and putting the scraps from kitchen and yard to good use , try this . It works !	1
I notice this product works faster if I added a lot of shredded leaves ( carbon source ) .Tips : - Turn over or mix the compost once a week- Too much water will slow down the composting process- Kitchen garbage is a good starter but brown leaves are the fuel of compostHappy composting !	1
I have been using this product for 30 days so far , and will update this review when I have reached 90 days . My compost pile is actually in a lidded bin designed for this purpose . I have a combination of yard waste and kitchen waste in the pile . I 've not had very dramatic results composting in the bin by itself - it just seems to not decompose very quickly , despite following the general directions for this process . So I thought perhaps this additive would speed things up.When I first received the Ringer product , I sprinkled a good cup or two into the compost pile as is . It was going to rain the next day , so I did n't water it in . I have noticed so far that the pile seems to have sunk more than what I 'm used to seeing.This Ringer stuff smells like a barn , uh , natural fertilizer if you will . While the cardboard box helps reduce the odor somewhat , I decided to store this in a tightly lidded plastic container , so that I could keep this under my sink without the sink cabinet beginning to smell.I keep a small bucket on my counter for compostible fruit/veggie pieces . I have started adding a small scoop of the Ringer product to my bucket before I take it outside to the compost pile . I use a plastic cup that comes with liquid laundry detergent , and I add what amounts to about a tablespoon.As I said , I 'll update in 90 days to let you know how it continues to progress .	1
We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste . After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile , I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed . A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable . The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Ca n't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden .	1
I have been composting for almost 25 years . We produce a lot of kitchen waste as well as garden waste , and have a yard full of leaves . My father composted long before it was popular . He started about 45 years ago and I learned from him . In order to compost well you must have oxygen , moisture , organic matter and the bacteria to break down the waste.Just as happens in any wooded area , all of these elements are present and occur in good time naturally . If you wish to speed up the process ; it requires some work and the addition of micro-organisms . This is where the Ringer Compost Plus comes into the picture . Here is where the micro-organisms come from.Am I sure this product has all of the right organisms for my waste , how can one tell ? Only time will be the judge . In from one to three months I can add to this review . I would add ... . why would Ringer sell a product that will not work , since it is a product which is generally re-bought if it works well.Also , organic gardeners do compare notes.It is important to also make sure your compost gets the other things it needs . A rolling barrel can be purchased or just turn the compost pile periodically with a shovel and keep it moist . I do not like shovel work and I am cheap , so I made a composting unit out an old water well pressure tank that had failed . I mounted it sideways on a simple 2x4 frame . It 's about the size of an oil drum . I cut a door with a reciprocating saw , hinged it and added a latch . I added a shaft through the center that sticks out of the ends and they sit on the wood frame , ( Like a hamster wheel ) . I can spin it to mix the compost which adds air and moisture through out . Maybe in 90 days I can give Compost Plus 5 stars .	1
When I first bought a rotary barrel-type composter I was really excited to get some nutrient rich material for my garden . Unfortunately it was n't that easy . I followed directions but it never seemed to do what it was supposed to do . The grass stayed green and wet and the leaves stayed dry and brown.I started using the Ringer Compost Plus over a month ago and I can honestly say that it has made a difference . FINALLY I am getting the type results that I had been wanting . There might be another way of accomplishing this without a compost starter but for me this is working just fine .	1
New material reduced more than 50 % in just 14 days.shipper is faster than the last batch and much more reasonable costsI will order from this vendor again	1
I started to use composts when I went to Master Gardener school . It is a wonderful way to get rid of all the food scraps and peelings that you usually through in the garbage.There is more to composting than just putting scrapes on the ground you can actually use vacuum bag dust ( if there is no food ) I also put my hair cuttings , newspapers and leaves and grass clippings are also used . Letters and junk mail can be cut up and tossed in also . All you have to do is toss all of this once in a while and you come up with compost . I am lazy I never turn my compost I leave it out and my chickens have a ball scratching up the compost . I wind up having the best soil for the summer garden.Ringer 3050 Compost Plus is a great product it has lots of good micro organisms that literally eat up all the waste and turn it into compost . Sure you can get a good soil without it but this product speeds up the porcess and adds lots of good organisms that add extra nutrishment to the mix.All you do is lay down the foundation and then add the amount you need for the size pile you have , turn it a few times wet it down and within 3 months you start to see the results of the composting . You can use the fresh soil for anything to grow , plants vegetables , flowers shrubs and even sprinkle it on the grass..	1
I 've used this saw for several hours which is sufficient to give me an opinion as to its effectiveness and value . It 's easy to set up , just use the wingnut clamp to secure it to the pole and off you go , no tools required . It stays put as does the extention of the pole . One easy to use clip on the pole allows you to move the extention in or out and lock it . It stays locked . Use it off the pole to trim off limbs from felled trees or easy to reach stuff . I 've found many uses for the saw without the pole that makes to yard work go easy . It 's safer than a gas chain saw and lighter . It is durable , it has n't failed me . I maintain my machines and keep them ready to work , but I do n't baby this saw or any piece of machinery . This saw does what it 's supposed to without complaint . I pinched the chain in a limb ( operator error ! ) and had to free it with another saw , but the Remington went right back to working without throwing a chain , bending , or breaking . Anyway you ... slice ... it , using a chain saw to cut trees is tough on machinery . This saw has chewed through pine , oak , and cherry quickly and easily . When it 's at full extention it 's a little unwieldy because , afterall , you have a weight on one end of a pole and it will tend to be top heavy . But it is light enough to manuver and keep where you want it to cut and I have n't found its balance to be a problem . It does leak chain oil . In the yard , who cares ? In the garage , it can be messy . But also tells you in the manual that it will leak the chain oil and recommends that you empty the oil resevoir when you store the saw . It holds about 3 ounces of motor oil and draining the oil is a ten second operation . Not a problem . When in use , one push of the oiler cap before eash cut and it 's happy . It has an aggressive chain tooth layout which helps to slice through even big limbs . It 's a ten inch saw , if you need to cut 14+ inch limbs/trees , you 'll need a heavier chainsaw that 's designed for that purpose . If you use this saw for its designed use , you wo n't have any difficulty pruning or taking off fairly meaty limbs from a safe position . I recommend it .	1
I have had this since 2011 and used 8-10 times so far with no issues . Best chain saw on a pole for the money . Works great for cutting branches . Beats a hand saw type hands down.After my first use of the chain saw I was thoroughly impressed . It worked great for cutting small to medium size branches . I would highly recommend this product for anyone interested in a chain saw on a pole.Keys to keeping this working well is keep the chain oiled . It does not do this automatically like a normal chain saw.Moving the cord around is kind of a pain but no more then I use this it is fine . I saved a bunch vs a gas unit and maintenance is much easier .	1
Well had this item for about a month now , and I shall say it is a great saw , the only down side of it is once it is on the pole and fully extended , it is a bit on the heavy side , but other than that this saw is just great , lots of power , blade/bar size is perfect for cutting through damn near everything , easy to use , I mean this thing is so much fun to use it should be illegal : ) Changing unit from pole saw to chain-saw is so simple even a caveman could do it ( like me ) . So if your looking for a great quality pole-saw/chain-saw I would definitely give this on a try .	1
This saw is awesome . Took it out for it 's first use today . Great power on demand at the push of a button , no worries about gas or oil , just the lube the chain and you 're good to go . Sliced through moist maple like butter . Handled branches up to 8 '' with ease . It did , however , throw its chain after an hour of use , which was entirely my fault ; do what you 're supposed to , and adjust the tension are the new chain has warmed up ( and therefore expanded ! ) a bit . A great , versatile tool !	1
Lots of reviews so I 'll keep it short . I 've used this both on , and off the pole to the point where if it died I 'd still be happy with it , but it 's still going strong . Lots and lots of use . I keep it sharp , adjusted and use the prescribed 30 weight chain oil.It also allows me to make cuts either from the ground , or on a ladder , when I 'm in a better position to get out of the way if something falls . We 've used this to safely make the final cuts on limbs that were still hanging from a gas chain saw cut .	1
I got this for a friend who is 80 . He had told me he was looking at them at a local hardware store . I told him I would check online for reviews and prices . We agreed this was the one for him . And it was 80 bucks cheaper than the store.He really likes it but has to go slow . He wanted the electric one because he did n't want to use a pull cord starter .	1
Nothing like a chain saw to bring one 's manliness to the fore . This one is more powerful than I anticipated , and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage . The saw attaches easily to the pole . Trimming that limb over your fence , no problem ( assuming you do n't smash the fence ) . Cleans up yard trash in a snap . I did not experience the oil leakage described by others . The chain does n't turn fast enough to burn , so oiling is n't as critical as with a gas saw . And the fact that it 's green will appeal to your feminine side .	1
NICE	1
I use this shears for trimming grass around my landscaped flower bed in the front lawn . It is hard to mow around the bricks , so this shears comes in very handy . I love the fact that the handle/head can swivel and it is so light weight . Also , as with all the Fiskars blade products , the blades are very sharp and I am able to trim precisely what I want . A great product to trim the grass around areas the lawn mower ca n't reach .	1
I have had really good luck with Fiskar 's products and thought I would give the grass shears a try . The have lived up to my expectations and then some . The rotating head is a really nice feature that I 've not seen on other brands . When trimming the grass near the concrete steps and brick walkway , the rotating head allows me to get very close so I am able to make an even cut . The blade is very sharp , even after several uses with no sign of rust . The blade locks in place and makes storage easy so I do n't have to worry about cutting my fingers when reaching for it in the tool shed . Great product !	1
Fiskars Shear Ease Grass Shears are the best grass clippers I 've ever used . We bought these locally and had a choice among 3 different clippers . Of the three , these were the most expensive , lightest in weight , and also were the easiest to open/close . I was going to get the middle-priced shears because we do n't use them that much , but decided to purchase the Fiskars instead . I 'm glad I did . They are very light , easy to cut with and do n't require a lot of force . The blades are sharp and remind me of Fiskars scissors . I did n't have any trouble with my hand getting pinched , but I can see how it might be a problem . I suggest wearing gloves if you think you might be prone to pinching or blisters when you use these . The rotating head came in handy when I trimmed around railroad ties . The blades are already grass stained after being used for approx . 20 min . It 's suggested that you clean the blades after each use & oil them once in a while for longer life . I can see how grass stain build up could eventually make the blade sticky requiring more hand pressure to open/close them . The blades are fully hardened stainless steel . I expect them to remain sharp for a long time.These shears have a lifetime warranty .	1
This grass shears is awesome . In the past I had issue 's with my standard shears , because I could not get the right angle to cut properly . This product absolutely erases all of those issue 's ; the pivoting head allows me to use this product everywhere I need to .	1
This is my first grass shears I have purchased . I was n't sure if I would like it but I took a chance and love it ! We love them because of the of pivoting head that allows to get really close and different angles . It works so nice for the those little areas along the sidewalk and along the steps . Very easy to use and very sharp !	1
Though I have several string trimmers , there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front . If I accidentally cut those vines , I 'll be in big trouble , and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks . The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and does n't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units . I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I do n't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well , and though I only use them a few times a year , they 're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises . I 've noticed that my pair does n't close all the way when put in the locked position . That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange ( Oriole colors ) shears again ? Most definitely .	1
I bought this thing when they still had the wooden handles . Being an avid sewer , I am quite familiar with Fiskars scissors and have many pairs that I rely on and have for many , many years . So , when I saw these at the local garden store , it was a no brainer in my mind . SO glad I have these ! Of ALL the tools like this I 've owned over the years , this set of Loppers from Fiskars is the only set that has n't broken , become jammed , or some other weird thing . I clean them after each use to keep diseases spreading from plant to plant . They 're amazingly easy to use , especially for women , and boy , the clean cuts it makes just makes everything you do a breeze . One of those items I am SO glad I found ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND !	1
Love these loppers - I 've been using them for almost a year now . Great for those jobs where I used to use small hand pruners that took lots & lots of effort ( you know those branches that are really too big for hand pruners , but that you do n't want to get the big giant loppers out for , so you squeeze & squeeze the pruners until the branch is finally cut ? ? ) These cut SO easily & cleanly that they 're a pleasure to use . ( As an aside , I had an old pair of Fiskars hand pruners that had become badly misaligned . I called the company to inquire about how I could fix them , and they just replaced them for me . Great customer service ! ) These loppers are really for relatively close branches ; should you need to prune branches that are farther away , you 'd want to buy longer ones.Highly recommended .	1
I love this tool . I have removed small weeds to larger branches with no problems at all . Thank you for a great product !	1
Lightweight yet able to easily cut through a 1.5 inch branch of an Oak . Simply put , this is a great buy .	1
Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade . Feeling embarrassed , I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I 'd broken . Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days . I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly . How often does that happen these days ? ( I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old , thick branches . )	1
perfect length for average jobs , cuts like cutting butter , which is very true , keep it clean and well lube , and it cuts like nothing else , best lopper i 'd used for sure , blade holds up very well , do wear gloves when using this , because of `` cancer causing materials '' , if you have an i-phone , you probably familiar with these subjects .	1
best I 've found and bought a second pair for my wife so she would quit using mine and leave em out instead of putting them away I 'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works .	1
I bought this tool because of the reviews . The reviews were so correct . This tool is a great investment . You will be inspired to clean up neglected shrubs etc . on your property . If the branch fits into the opening , you can get a good clean cut . You have to get used to the cutting angle , but after a short time , you become a pro . Great tool !	1
The Fiskars 9625 PowerGear Bypass Lopper is a very effective tool , that usually gets the job done , without the user having to expend an excessive amount of energy . This is mostly because the lopper is designed with some large `` gearlike '' teeth , which act to increase leverage , and direct the applied force to the cutting surfaces . This results in a tool that is generally more efficient and requires less effort , than most conventionally designed cutters , where brute force is usually required to cut through thicker or harder objects.According to the information on the product page , the maximum capacity is a diameter of 1.5 inches . So far , I have used the PowerGear only on shrubs and small trees , with branches that are about an inch or less in diameter . It has no problems cutting through either softer branches , or harder dried out ones . Because the lower cutting edge is curved , you ca n't always go straight in , and cut where you want . You may need to alter your approach , and come in at an alternate angle , in order to make the cut . This can be slightly inconvenient , but you will learn to work around it.If you are used to applying massive force when using a cutter , you may be pleasantly surprised by the PowerGear , as it usually makes the task easier , and seldom becomes a physical struggle . The blades are supposedly coated with a non-stick substance . I 'm not sure how long this lasts , but so far the blades have been relatively easy to clean.The blades are described as being `` razor sharp '' and `` precision ground '' , but that 's mostly promotional hype . The blade is certainly sharp , but I was slightly disappointed at the uneven cutting edge on my blade . The feel of the plastic handles is just adequate , as they do n't provide an especially secure grip , something that can be important , when you are wearing work gloves , which can be slippery.A particularly strange oddity concerns the color of the blade . My blade is black , but in some photos the blade is sliver colored . I have no idea , what difference this may make , but the lack of standardization just seems strange.There are several versions of the PowerGear lopper , so you may want to check for the one that best suits your needs . This one is for mid-sized branches , that are within easy reach . Usually priced at about $ 25 , I had to wait for some time before I was able to buy this cutter for just $ 18 . If you see it at that level , you might want to act fast , as it probably wo n't be there for long . Like most Fiskars products , this one is fairly well designed and a solid value .	1
These are designed to cut far more easily than your garden variety loppers , and they do just that . It says right on the handles that they cut `` three times easier , '' and indeed they do . You want a tool that does the same amount of work with 1/3 the force on the handle side . Since work equals force times displacement , you need to triple the displacement of ( amount you open ) the handles , and you will get the same amount of work done with 1/3 the amount of force . Since the blade is moving effectively 1/3 the distance you 'd expect for such a large movement of the handles , it 's providing three times the force , allowing you to do what really amounts to the same amount of work , but with what feels like 1/3 the effort.Since the blade , when closed , looks to be at somewhere near a 30 degree angle compared to the handle , and when opened , appears to be at around a 90 degree angle , the gears are accomplishing exactly what is needed to do what they claim . It 's not a marketing claim . It 's not a matter of what it feels like subjectively . When they say that it cuts three times more easily , it 's an objective fact.The only possible down side is that if you need to work close and have limited room for handle movement , the blades wo n't separate enough . But for pruning trees , that 's probably a non issue . They claim that it will cut branches up to 1.5 inches , and I concluded the same thing when I used them . But it will take the amount of force needed with other tools to cut a 1/2 inch branch . When I cut the largest branch I needed to cut using the maximum opening of the jaws ( perhaps a bit more than 1.5 inches ) it did take effort ( but not struggle ) to close the handles . But on branches of an inch or less , I 've had more problems cutting paper with school scissors .	1
Has the usual ( very slight ) fade after 5 months , BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything ( live in SB , Cali and we get moisture/sun every day ) . The material is thick and sturdy ... I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great . Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different , to me , that what it looks like in the photos . Will update after a full summer if it holds up and does n't crack , then bump up to 5 stars .	1
I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota , where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather . The cover has held up wonderfully . The only word of caution is on the color . It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels . They may be green when you first buy the cover , but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill . To me , this is a minor drawback , but others might find it more objectionable .	1
the canvas type material is very heavy and easy to clean . It covers our grill from top to bottom . I just wish there were mor color choices , I do n't like the white down the middle .	1
It is not just plain beige ... .I love the green on both sides ... however it does say & # 34 ; Char-Broil & # 34 ; on the front . It is heavy and feels very durable . A bargain at 23.91 in my opinion .	1
Well made and does the job . Unfortunately it does n't reach all the way to the ground and does n't have tie-downs , but other than that it works great .	1
I recently invested in a new grill . Having lived in an apartment complex where I was n't permitted to have a grill for the last fifteen years , I was and still am quite excited about the grill.I spent a little more than I originally planned to pay , but decided that it was worth putting a little more money into it on the front end to prevent the desire to replace it within just a couple of years.A long-term investment like this needs to be protected , of course . I checked the Char-Broil site to see what cover they recommend for theChar Broil T480 4-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill , with Sideburnerand found that they recommend the Char-Broil 2185564 65-Inch Artisan Mountain Green Grill Cover , so I ordered it from Amazon.The cover is very thick , and I believe it will withstand rain and other weather should I eventually decide to keep the grill outside . For now I store it in the garage , but I still like to have the cover on it.This cover is easy to take on and off and looks as attractive as a grill cover can . The length is just a bit shorter than the grill itself , so you can wheel the grill around with the cover on without tripping over the edges.I 'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend it .	1
Used these in my rain barrel all summer and we did n't have any mosquitos breeding in the standing water . Done .	1
These seem to keep the bugs at bay if used properly . I use them in any standing water . Pots . Low areas of soil or grass . Just keep away from pets and kids .	1
We have rain barrels ranging from 55 gallons to 400 and these drop right in and really keep the Mosquitos from breeding . I cut a strip off and gave to a friend . I also bought bags of loose mosquito stopper but have not used it yet as these little donuts have worked well .	1
The summit mosquito dunks 20 pack is a great deal at 17 bucks as compared to what I normally pay for a 6 pack which is around 10 to 12 dollars . These typically last for about 30 days each time I put one in my small 6 x 5 x 2 pond . I use a half dunk as that will suffice for an area that small .	1
I have used these for years in my rain barrels . They work great to keep those dreaded mosquitos from breeding .	1
I used these last year . Never saw any active larvae . This is one weapon in the fight against mosquitoes . Sometimes the dunk floats out if the container overflows like in heavy rain . Minor problem.I used it in the bird bath . I did n't see any dead birds littering our yard.Great product .	1
These mosquito dunks work ! I purchased them for a small , outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas . We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain . It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain . We do n't like the looks of it so we 're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain . Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we 'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it 'll float right over the edge . I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants . So far so good , I have n't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year . Locally , I saw this product for between $ 9 & 10 dollars .	1
I purchased these as recommended by friend and am sure they will work as recommended . I did just set up my rain barrels and have n't used them yet . All is pretty self explanatory and straight forward . I am happy to have them .	1
All trimmers are like writers , they need good lines . The Weed Eater line is perfect as it is made for this trimmer and buying in bulk saves dollars !	1
I bought this to restring my Black and Decker Trimmer . I used to buy the pre-strung cartridges from them , but they cost a small fortune compared to using this . I have re-strung two carts . and have had great success with them after using this product . The line feeds through just like the original line and does not seem to go any more quickly than the original . Definitely a great way to save money if you do n't mind spending a few minutes restringing.EDIT - 5/10/12After over 2 seasons of trimming , weedwacking , and edging - I still have tons of string left ! What a great investment ! My property is not very large , about an average size lot for Southern New Jersey . ( around 3500 sq feet of lawn space ) .	1
You must buy this if you buy a string trimmer . The string breaks often so you need extra refills of the proper width .	1
Trimmer line that fits , is relatively easy to work with and inexpensive . I am only 1/3 thru the package and if the trimmer itself lasts then I will buy more line like this . It 's great stuff	1
This is a great replacement trimmer line for myBlack & Decker NST1024 24-Volt Cordless String Trimmer/Edger . If I were to purchase theBlack & Decker AF-100-3ZP 30-Feet 0.065-Inch Line String Trimmer Replacement Spool , 3-Pack , it would have been over 19 cents per foot . At the time of my review , this product is less than 3 cents per foot ! It took a little research to figure out how to properly re-string my empty spool since Black and Decker 's replacements are pre-strung spools . Once I figured it out , re-stringing my spool was easy . After I finished stringing approximately 10 feet to test , I took the trimmer for a run and it worked great ! I did the entire yard to make sure it worked well . I 've done the yard a second time since then . It actually seems to trim the weeds cleaner and easier than Black and Decker 's line . I 'm so glad that I gave this product a chance . It 's great quality and saved me a bunch of money .	1
I was n't even going to write a review because I figured all lines are about the same . But this stuff seems tougher , more flexible , and easier feeding than what came with my B & D trimmer . It seems to have a powdery lubricant like talc that helps with winding and feeding .	1
There is really not that much to say about this product . If you need 0.065 inch diameter monofilament replacement line for your string trimmer , this spool is competitively priced at about five dollars for 200 feet . Just make sure this is the size you need , and not the larger 0.080 inch diameter line.If you really want to buy in bulk , you can get the 2000 foot roll and save even more.Weed Eater 952711559 0.080-Inch by 2000-Feet Bulk Round String Trimmer Line	1
I cooked a Turkey on my Charcoal Rotisserie for Thanksgiving 2010 . I used the Pecan Wood Chips according to the instructions on the bag , and WOW ! ! ! They put a taste into that Turkey that is hard to describe ! ! It was so delicious and jucy . I always wondered what Pecan Wood smoke would do to meat , and now I know . No turning back now . I must try some Ribs with these chips next , and a Roasting Chicken ... ..mmmmmmmmm ! ! Highly recommended . Will purchase again .	1
I have a Weber gas grill with a smoke box at the side . The first thing I used was made of tiny little splinter type things . Too small too fast . These pieces are larger ; most are too large to fit in the smoke box . I hate having to wield a hatchet to break them up . 3/4 & # 34 ; to 1 & # 34 ; would be a lot better . However once these catch the flavor is right on .	1
Great tasting hickory . I would give it a 5 but some of the pieces are too large to slip between the bars on my Weber 320 and so it only gets a 4 since I need to use pliers to move the grate and drop in the wood .	1
I used these chips for smoking chickens and pork ribs . I love the sweet smoke flavor that only fruit woods can add to a BBQ . They worked out great for me and a little went a long way in the propane smoker .	1
I have tried both dry and soaking in water . Jury is still out on that one.What I can tell you is flavor is noticible . Chips are much easier to work with in reference to Weber 's E670 smoker box . Chucks would be more appropriate for charcoal or homemade tin foil smoker bricks.Tried Charbroils version from HD . Will continue to be buying Weber 's version.Purchase again ? YES	1
Great for adding flavor to slow cooked meat . Make sure you know what you 're doing and do n't go crazy on the wood . A little bit goes a long way , but apple wood is one of the best woods for smoking pork . the chips are good sized they arrived dry no musty smell no bugs and are much better then I can get at our local store . I will be buying this again .	1
Being new to smoking we were n't sure which wood to go with . So we bought Apple , Pecan , and Mesquite . I think Apple is my favorite flavor but all had great results . The bags have lasted multiple smokings and do n't require to be soaked in water for 24 hours to get a good smoke out of them ( seems like some woods require a long soak time ) . Again , I 'm not a pro , but thats how we felt about them !	1
makes good smoke taste	1
These are just super . Throw them in a cup for thirty minutes to soften them , then the food absorbs all of that sweet apple smoke flavor . Yum , yum .	1
Please see my review of the hickory chips . These are certainly chips , they are certainly apple and they certainly smoke . How on earth do you rate something like this . Everyone does understand that we are going to burn these up right ?	1
I could n't find this at my two local hardware stores , they did n't stock any bar and chain oil surprisingly . I used this in my newHusqvarna 450 18-Inch 50.2cc X-Torq 2-Cycle Gas Powered Chain Saw With Smart Start ( CARB Compliant ) and it works great . They do n't recommend you use any motor oil or different purposed oil so I definitely recommend this product . I had some husqvarna chain oil in my last chainsaw for years , and to be honest I ca n't find any difference in noticeable viscosity or functionality of that product over this ( it was a lot more expensive ) .	1
I wanted Poulan brand oil , and this was the only place I could find it . More expensive but it works great . Nothing to compare it to , but I 'm happy anyways .	1
What can i say it 's bar chain oil at a normal price.What i can tell you is never us engine oil because it lacks the stickiness that the bar and chains need.Save the life of your chain and bar and use a quality oil .	1
If you do a lot of tree trimming or cutting you know the value of good chain oil . You need to use it to prolong the life of your chain and bar for your chain saws . I just trimmed 18 large trees and this oil helps to cut quickly through the large branches and protect and extend the life of your expensive chainsaw parts.The thing about chainsaw oil is that it is stickier than regular oil because of an additive to enhance the viscosity and it stays on the bar better to lubricate it while it is doing its job . It also does not sling off the chain as quickly as motor oil . When oil slings off the chain and bar , a lot of it is going onto you , your clothes and shoes . When you are trimming a tree above your head it is nice to have it not dripping back down onto you.This is a good product and I recommend it !	1
What can I say about chain oil ? I works to lubricate the chain on my small chain saw , and that 's what it 's supposed to do .	1
This kit is a great value and super easy to use . I love that they include a little packet of info on suggested Ph values for certain plants and veggies . Awesome ! ! !	1
I can now save money and feel confident on how my soil is doing . I test my garden and lawn at different times of the year . This way I can always try to have my levels exactly where I want them .	1
I wanted to test various parts of my garden soil to check the pH levels as well as the N , P , and K levels . This kit makes it a breeze . The pills are conveniently labeled and the instructions make it simple to understand what to do . The colored indicators make it easy to tell where your soil currently is at and the instructions give suggestions on how to adjust the levels should you need to .	1
These things work just fine . I would buy them again . I added to my soil what they said I was low on and I was pleased with the results .	1
I am Master Gardener and I must admit I broke the Cardinal rule of gardening , I never test my ground . Even when the MG program offered it to me for free when I graduated , I could not be bothered . I thought I could adjust my garden when I needed it myself without any help from a test kit . Until I moved , this house has a wonderful piece of property that I use for my vegetable garden and for the first three years everything was perfect , until this year . Nothing wants to grow , so I broke down and bought this item , low an behold I have a problem , nothing major but my phosphorous is completely depleted and that is the explanation for the way my veggies are growing . I found out what must be done and I did it and everything is turning around..Good sound product I recommend it to the gardener that thinks he/she knows it all , ( but we really do n't . )	1
I like the 10 '' size . It holds a substantial pot , whether you change the plant three times a year , or keep one perennial as I do . The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes . While it is not heavy duty , it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely . Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet , or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia . Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years .	1
We are in zone 5-6a and I have a small gardenia which needs to be brought indoors during the winter . I have been looking for a place where I can put the pot that would allow me to enjoy the scent and still bring it in when the weather grows cold.This is perfect because the holder is adjustable and fits my deck perfectly . This also holds my 10 inch pot and is very sturdy.Very nice product , easily adjustable , easy to use .	1
I have several pot holders like this one on my deck . This flower pot in particular is pretty sturdy . The only thing I would change is for it to come with a little instruction book or an explanation on how you get it to fit on the railing .	1
This came packaged quite well , and I did not have any missing parts . The brackets were on the holder itself , with zip ties and they were easy enough to find . The instructions were clear as how to hang this properly , and installation time took less than two minutes.It is holding a 10 inch pot of geraniums and it was easy to attach to the fence post . I would order this again .	1
This hanger works great for hanging my potted plants from my side porch . I do n't have an overhang to hang plants from hangers , so prior to this , I was only able to set my flowers out on my side porch on my table , not hang them . This holder slides right over the railings of my porch and lets me hang flowers off the side so they are viewable from my driveway and the street out front . It 's also a nice solution when you do n't want to drill anything permanent into your porch to hang flowers . Just slide this holder over a railing and set your potted flowers inside , that 's all there is to it ! I like that I can also move this to other areas of my porch , if my flower are in need of more sun .	1
This attractive black pot holder installs easily . I appreciated the versatility as it can fit 2 x4 '' to 2x 6 '' inch railing . I am not mechanically inclined but was able to affix this to my deck with no problems . It is designed with a `` bumper '' which prevents the pot from tipping . The black color should blend with just about any d & eacute ; cor.This is a convenient way for me to keep a pot of fresh herbs in close proximity to the grill on my deck . The hardware seemed a bit flimsy but so far it has held . This is a good way to bring a color to your deck , balcony or fence . Recommended .	1
The holder itself is made fine but the harware is really cheap . It will hold a large pot , which is nice . I prefer to look for a holder that will fit over the rails of my porch .	1
CobraCo 's adjustable flower pot holder is a flexible product that can be used to fit on deck railing up to 4 inches across . The brackets easily attach in 1 of 2 configurations depending on the width of your rail . There are 3 screws on each side to lock the bracket down . There is a bottom bumper support to rest against a post or rail to keep the plant level . The holder easily accommodates a plant pot of up to 10 inch diameter.This is an easy way to beautify your deck . Just add plant , and water .	1
An effective design and well thought out holder giving you numerable options in mounting positions . The `` U '' shaped wire at the rear of the base strengthens the holder and holds it out from the post to ensure the pot remains level , as well as stable . The mounting brackets are simple yet effective allowing you to mount the holder in different locations , a welcome change from the `` special '' mounts that require you to purchase multiple holders to mount flower pots in different positions . bogie	1
I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant . After I initially set this holder at the desired spot , I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job . The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch . I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side , depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want , so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon . The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds .	1
This is a good , standard pot holder . The metal construction is sturdy and it keeps my plant perfectly perched on my wood railing ( a plus because some of the non-adjustable holders I 've found are meant for a skinnier metal railing and do n't work for my situation ) . So functionality wise , these have been perfect . But aesthetically , it still pretty utilitarian looking . There 's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration . Because of that , I like using this with a pot that is well designed and pretty on it 's own.Aesthetics aside , it functions as expected and is perfect for people ( like me ) whose railings are not a uniform size .	1
Decent quality though not quite as sturdy as I would have wanted.Good news though , it fits 6 '' or less rails with an adjustable arm . My package had all the items included . Some folks complained the brackets were n't included but I noticed mine were just lying in the bottom of the box separate from the rest of the item . Perhaps the customer missed them or perhaps the shipper missed them . Not sure . But without those it is useless.Holds a 10 inch pot . Looks nice . Just wish the metal was a bit better quality . I worry it might wear , bend , or break over time . I will update if this occurs .	1
This is a metal holder for flower pots . It is fairly basic , not decorative but if you just need to put your pots of pretty flowers out on a rail it will do the job.Some reviewers complained of parts missing but mine was complete . It took me a minute to figure out that I need to turn a screw to loosen the parts and then tighten it up but that was easy enough . Seems to be a good product .	1
Overall this is a nice flowerpot holder for a deck railing . It is adjustable to fit a range of railing widths , and holds up to a ten inch pot . It blends in well , and holds a heavy pot securely . It is not permanent - I had no problems removing it and repositioning it ( after removing the pot , of course ) .On the downside , the construction quality for something that is going to be outdoors 100 % of the time ( and often wet from rain or water coming out of the pot ) is not as good as I would have liked it to be . It 's all steel ( painted ) held together with welds . My concern is rust - it would have been nice to have it be made of stainless , or have a plastic coating on the steel to help prevent/minimize rust . I 'll certainly be bringing this indoors in the winter , and most likely will need to spray paint it regularly to keep it rust-free , especially where it may get scratched from a clay pot.But so far so good . It 's a nice addition to the deck , and I very much like that it 's secure but not a permanent installation .	1
This simple flower pot holder will hold most 10 inch flower pots . It has a strong metal frame with a black vinyl coating so it holds up well against weathering and it 's rust resistant . It 's very easy to get set up and is fully adjustable . It should be able to hang on most deck railings , balconies and maybe some fences that have a flat top on them . It 's very strong and should n't have any problem holding even a really heavy pot .	1
This adjustable flower pot holder works marvelously in a typically difficult area I enjoy having a flowering plant . I usually end up having a hanging plant , but with this adjustable pot it 's very easy to attach to a board on the side of my barn . There 's a weathered two-by-four hammered into the side and instead of hanging a plant on the edge , I can now arrange it in a complementary fashion . The bumper keeps it from swaying and keeps the holder and pot level . If you have one of those oddball spots where you 'd like to have a plant , the CobraCo just may have solved your problem.I opted for a rather heavy plant and did n't experience any problem with forward bending . The design of this adjustable flower pot is perfect and quite well-balanced . If you are also in the market for an adjustable flower box holder , CobraCo has a36-inch black adjustable/expandable flower box holderand a24-inch adjustable white flower box holder . These would look especially nice on a balcony . Weather resistance for this type of item is usually quite good ( I have standing pot holders like this ) , but I 'd recommend taking them in for the season . I love this innovative adjustable pot holder and ca n't find a thing I do n't like about it .	1
I ca n't get over how easily this product changes to fit my needs . I have a wide railed deck railing outside and narrow railed wrought iron railing around a balcony in my living room inside . I can switch this within in minutes to fit either railing.I do n't know how long it will have to be out in the weather to affect the paint on this , but I tried a sharp knife and it took a very sharp one and a lot of pressure to even scratch this - but yes it does scratch under a lot of abuse.It is built so that it has a piece in the back that acts a bit like a stabilizer so that the flower pot will not be at to sharp of an angle -water/heavy rain will drain out but the soil will stay inside the pot .	1
I have this attached to my rails on my back porch . I just planted a bunch of geraniums ( red and white ) and put the pot into the holder when I was done . Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over . But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product . It looks better when you get it . When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got !	1
The CobraCo R0926-B 10-Inch Adjustable Flower Pot Holder in black is perfect for iron or wooden fencing , balconies or decks . It can be easily adjusted to fit multiple thicknesses of railing . The holder is vinyl coated so will not rust . Holds even heavy plants up to those in 10 '' pots level . Also comes in white .	1
This hanger works great . It is adjustable . It is very sturdy and holds a good size planter . I am using it instead of hanging baskets on my front porch and it looks really cute .	1
It is flexible , can hold 50+ pounds ( lbs ) , and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl . thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets . You can ignore the manufacturer 's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches . When using only 1 or 2 bracket 's bolts ( of 3 ) closest to the pot 's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat ( bar ) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp 's flat ( bar ) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches . It is safe to use just 1 bolt , as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force , which can very little pull ( shear away ) the bolts , one of which can easily handle . However , the overall look is less than inspiring .	1
This pot holder is really sturdy , much more than any other pot holder I have tried of its size . It also has a lot of flexibility in the size of the brackets to adjust to different railings or fences.I tried this flower pot holder out in a couple of places before I found one that had the best sunlight and water possibilities - morning sun and only partial cover by a porch roof . Then I decided on a great kindness to the plant , a vine that does n't like trouble , and I put it on the side of the fence that faces my husband 's garden instead of mine . His side has about 90 % better chance ( okay , 100 % ) of being watered in a timely manner . I have the general attitude that if plants are meant to live , they will -- except during the drought , and then even I showed better sense than that.The only thing I could have wished from this would be for a little more depth . The size of the pot that will fit in here really is 7 inches at the bottom . I repotted the vine I was putting in here to make it shorter but I may have trouble with the vine later . : D	1
I love these adjustable flower pot holders . They keep the flowers at a higher level to enjoy as they hang on the deck railings rather than simply sitting on the deck . They are adjustable to fit most deck railings .	1
The flower pot holder is adjustable to fit . It is fairly sturdy and is easy to assemble . You will need a philips screw driver to put finish assembly . The only thing that I am not happy with is that put zip ties all over it and it was hard to cut with regular scissors . I found that to be annoying . But , I still find it to be a nicely made product .	1
I have n't had this flower pot holder long enough to really see how beautiful it will be hanging on my deck rail because it 's too early for my plants to bloom or vine . Soon I know it will be a real attraction and add a lot to our enjoyment . The pot fits securely and I 've planted petunias along with some vining plants . Plan to buy some `` partners '' for it as soon as I can find them on the market .	1
We set up the porch this weekend ( clean , bring up the furniture , put up the screens and shades ) and I installed this pot holder on the deck railing with a pot of tourenia . It was quick , simple and the holder seems sturdy enough to give us several seasons of use . I 'm considering getting two more as it 's a big deck .	1
This is very simple to assemble and adjust . I put it on my wooden deck railing with no problem . It 's sturdier than I expected and can hold a big pot of flowers without moving . The design is plain , so you 'll probably want a pretty pot to put in it . Great for renters like me who need non-permanent solutions for landscaping and decorating .	1
The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired , but I ca n't complain about the adjustability . The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence , and is big enough for most medium plant pots . It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon . It seems pretty strong , and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason , my set came with four extra metal brackets , and a ton of extra bolts . I was n't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets , which are metal , like the entire set-up . I will probably recycle them , unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around .	1
This is a wonderfully realized product . Whether mounted over narrow or wide railings , the included brackets configure securely for either wide or narrow installations.The ten-inch option that I acquired has a depth of five and a half inches - eight inch baskets are also available , both in either black or white . The construction is sturdy . The bumper that keeps the holder level against the vertical support of the mounting area is rounded , so that no matter where I install this , I am not at all worried about scuffs , scratches or unsightly indentations.I love CobraCo 's Adjustable Flower Pot Holder . This is the perfect item for helping to get another flower pot up and out of the way . It 's well-built , it 's easy to use and it really livens things up .	1
I 'm really pleased with this Flower Pot Basket . It was so easy to put together and can handle a10 inch flower pot . I placed it on my front porch rail and it is a perfect fit .	1
We have coyote fences in my neck of the wood which are Latilla wood rods wrapped around an iron post . It 's not always easy to find something which will hang easily on the inside of the fence , which is why I was interested to see this planter design . I find it works perfectly although it may be just a tad too flimsy for anything with a substantial weight . That being said , I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely . The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while . It 's a nice idea and I will recommend it to my neighbors who are always trying to figure out gadgets so they can hang flowers on their coyote fences .	1
We have all different types of fencing in our yard -- split rail , decking and wood fence . The CobraCo flower pot holder accommodates them all . It has a nifty L-shaped clasp that adjusts two ways to hang from virtually any support -- for thinner railings ( 2-4 '' ) and thicker railings ( 4.5-6 '' ) . I was worried this pot holder would be like so many others that tilt forward on an angle when a heavy plant is actually sitting in it . To my delight , it sits perfectly vertical , thanks to another nice feature , a bumper that hits up against rails and prevents any slant . This is a generous sized pot holder . It can fit up to 10 '' pots , and if weight is an issue , it could also hold a large coco fiber liner instead . One of my favorite summer pastimes is relocating flower baskets , and this is the perfect gardening companion .	1
This is an adjustable pot hanger that will work on most railings , decks , etc.It definitely does not have a high-end look , and I do wonder at its durability , but it 'll work for most situations.If you need a lot of these it could get pricey .	1
Fast , secure shipping . Everything was inside the box & nothing was missing.I dont know why the other person had problems with lost brackets , but mine were secured inside the bottom of the basket by 2 zip ties . Hard to spot right off ... ... . but they were there.Would I buy again from this vendor ... ... ... 100 % yes .	1
This is a nice , versatile pot holder for any sort of railing . We live in a townhouse , and each unit has a fenced-in , concrete patio . There 's really no place to plant flowers , so a container garden is an only option . I did n't want many containers crowding the ground of my small patio , so I opted for hanging them places.This pot holder is exactly what I needed . It 's 10 inches at the top , and will accommodate a range of flower pots . The fastener is adjustable , to make them useful in a wide variety of locations . I was able to fit it to our fencing perfectly . It 's sturdy and well-made , and I expect it will last through many cycles of flowers .	1
The CobraCo Adjustable Flower Pot Holder is nicer than expected & mdash ; the black vinyl-coated metal is much stronger than the holder it replaced . Because of the wind , a drill was used to install it permanently on a deck railing with six heavy-duty wood screws . It will hold any standard 8 or 10 in . flower pot and does n't compete with the plant for attention .	1
This product works well for what I want it to do - fit on an oddly sized apartment complex 's railing . It is adjustable . Just works .	1
Easy to use and adjust for my patio . It holds my flowers securely , no complains . I also do n't see any signs of rust yet , but it rained only 2-3 times .	1
Having a balcony pot holder makes my garden more interesting . Since it can be adjusted fairly tightly on the ledge , it wo n't fall down , and the plant will not accidentally topple over the way it would if I just placed it on the balcony ledge without a pot holder . Staggering the plant pot heights from high to low allows each plant to have an individual focal point , and the pot holder sits up the highest on the ledge so that 's great.The holder is easy to adjust with a variety of three holes per side and screws to secure it . However , my balcony ledge is a little wide so I can only use one screw per side . That is n't really a problem since my pot is balanced correctly thanks to the pot 's non-tip bumper in the back bottom of the holder . Also I like the fact that the holder is light weight and black is preferable , though it also comes in white . In addition , it is easy to move around or change the position of the pot and readjust the screws . The only negative about the screws is that they are a bit difficult to tighten by hand unless you use a tool . Once it is all set up , it seems very secure and looks great on my balcony .	1
This is a no frills Adjustable Flower Pot Holder , but it does n't really need any frills . There is no fancy ironworks on this one , but it really does n't need it as long as it works . I put this on on my 4 '' railing and it felt secure . I lined mine with the brown liners that come from hardware store so that you just have to put in the dirt and it looks great ! It can hold up to a 10 '' pot of flowers and that 's pretty wide ! All in all , I like it ! This on is Vinyl-coated steel and the longer one the same company makes is Powder-coated steel and feels much more substantial . Could n't ask for anything to be different .	1
Over the years I have tried a number of flower pot holders and have always been disappointed with the quality of them . This flower pot holder is made of strong and sturdy steel that is vinyl coated and rust proof so I do n't have to worry about rust stains on my deck rails or the holder hanging crooked because of the flower pot weight . It can hold up to 10 '' flower pots or even several small flower pots so it has great versatility . It was easy to install and looks simple , yet gorgeous . The only thing I did n't like was having to drill my new deck to install the flower pot holder . Overall , it 's a great item that 's a cut above the rest .	1
This 10-inch flower pot holder seems to be well made and sturdy . It 's a tiny bit tedious to put together , because there are 6 screws and nuts , but really after you do it one time , it 's unlikely that you will have to do it again . Plus this designed insures a solid mount with no bending.What I liked was that you can put the slidey bars on two ways for more flexibility.What I did n't like , and which earned the holder the extraction of one-star , was that despite the flexibility previously described , it did not fit my rail . Really , we have a basic deck . Rails are 2x2 '' risers with 1x4 '' flat tops.The solution to this was actually easy and consisted of taking the screws out and moving the sliding bar to the top , rather than on the bottom of the bar attached to the wire frame . That way it pokes out a little bit past the ring , but works perfectly.Since there 's a fix that will make this plant holder fit almost any rail , I do n't have any problem recommending it .	1
This is really nice ! It 's also bigger than I expected it to be . It attached to my deck rail very easily and seems really good and sturdy . I put a heavy pot of flowers inside and it looks great ! It hold the pot in place nicely with very little movement and it 's so well constructed that it does n't take away from the look of the pot itself . I plan on getting some more of these !	1
This is a substantial , yet almost invisible pot holder . Come to think of it , though , I have a light pot and plant in it ; if I had this attached to a railing on a second story or higher railing , I would think twice about placing a heavy pot in it for fear that it might break and fall . I like it fine on our first floor railing.The nuts to adjust the holder could be better . I would suggest using stainless steel wing nuts -- or even plastic with brass thread insert knobs -- to replace the acorn nuts . Even with those changes , this is still a reasonably-priced plant pot holder .	1
This is a simple sturdy product that works . It is holding a potted Geranium easily on my porch railing.This is easy to put together . When you hang this on a railing the flower pot holder is held securely thanks to two brackets and a bottom overhang.There are three screws on each side of the top of the flower pot holder . There are two brackets that the screws hold . On the bottom of the flower pot holder there is a four and a half inch by two and a half inch overhang on the back of the holder . The brackets and the bottom overhang secure the flower pot holder in place.The instructions say this will work on iron , aluminum and wood top railings up to 2 3/4 and wooded 2x4 and 2x6 railings . It fits up to 10 inch pots.This is sturdy and seems like it is made to last .	1
This is a very handy and attractive pant holder . Most of all , it is so easy to install , and if I decide to move it to another location , also very easy . Right now it 's holding my pot of blooming daffodils of my front porch railing . I also like the fact that it 's made in the USA .	1
This adjustable flower pot is very easy to use . Just attach the L shaped brackets depending on the width of what you are hanging it on . It is best on something like a deck railing as the top of this will be about level with the top of the railing so most what you will see is the plant . It could be used on a fence too but may be a bit too high .	1
This is well made , functional , easy to install , and seemingly durable . It was a perfect addition to our deck . We love the way it looks and are very happy with the quality and design .	1
I really like this Flower Pot Holder . It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps . It was quick and easy to set-up and it 's a really nice quality . It holds my flower pots really well . It 's nice , simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd . I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set . I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it .	1
Cobra 's 10-inch adjustable flower pot works well for those who would like a pot that can mount to their deck or patio railing and hold a pot up to 10-inches in diameter at the top ( and 7 inches in diameter at the base ) . The adjustable railing brackets have screw/bolt combinations that will accommodate railing widths between 2 and 6 inches . The pot is simple to adjust , install , and use . It will accommodate plastic , wood , metal , or clay pots as long as the dimensions are correct . The neutral black color works well anywhere .	1
I am thoroughly enjoying this plant holder . It fits perfectly over our metal balcony railing in our rental . Only time will tell is there will any rusting and peeling issues as I have encountered before with products of this nature .	1
Bought this to catch a little mouse that 's taken up residence in our garage . Did n't even know he was THERE until I put a plant that needed repotting out in the garage for a day till I could get around to repotting it . The next day , my plant was GONE ( eaten ) and there was dirt on the floor from the animal 's digging.What to do ? NO WAY am I going to set a conventional mousetrap and kill a mouse and then empty the trap . Nope . Not happening.I remembered seeing these at Amazon & ordered it . Set the trap the day after I got it & CAUGHT the little guy within about 4 hours of setting it ( I checked the trap hourly ; used 2 kibbles of dry cat food for bait ) .He was pretty nervous , so I covered the trap with a paper towel while I carried him out to a hedgerow , where I set him free ( instructions said to minimize human contact so as to not stress the animal -- I agree ) . Having read another reviewer 's experience of a frightened mouse running up their arm , I planned ahead & put the trap in the hedgerow , on the ground , pointed so that no matter which direction he ran , it would n't be toward me . Then I just took off the paper towel & pressed down on the main trigger so both doors opened simultaneously . My little guy cautiously poked his nose out of the trap , took a couple of sniffs of air , & bolted like a shot.Trap quality is excellent and it 's very easy to set , once you get the `` hang '' of it . Just press down on the main trigger arm , make sure your 2 locking arms for the doors are positioned at the tops of the doors , bait the pivoting bait bar inside , then position the `` baiting bar '' over your `` main trigger '' bars . Easier than it sounds ; you 'll get printed instructions & photos in the box.Highly recommended ! And it will make you feel good to use a compassionate solution to your mouse problem.Have a question ? Leave a comment & I 'll be happy to help you if I can. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -UPDATE 9/22/13 Evening : Uh-oh . On a lark , I re-set the trap this afternoon . Just checked it 10 minutes ago . I caught ANOTHER one ( smaller ) . Let her go & set the trap AGAIN . How many might we have ? We 'll see ... UPDATED UPDATE 9/24/13 : OK . I did not know we had mice in the garage . Thanks to this trap , I 've caught and released FOUR ( Mama , Papa , & 2 cute babies ) . The trap 's been set all day today & no takers , so maybe that was the extent of the family . I 've learned one other tip : set the trap during the DAY so you can release during DAYLIGHT . Unless you do n't mind setting mice free IN THE DARK . Personally , I ca n't bear to leave them caged once I 've caught them , so I like to release as soon as they 're caught . GREAT SYSTEM ; most highly recommended for its utility and ease of use ! UPDATE # 3 10/12/13 : GUESS WHAT ? Mice can run LOTS faster than humans can walk . I 'd re-set the trap yesterday afternoon & did n't catch anything . Till 10:30 at NIGHT . Remember my advice about not setting the trap after dark ? I did n't ( remember ) . I should have sprung the trap at dark . But I did n't . So when I did one last check of the trap last night -- -SURPRISE ! -- -I caught another one ! And since it was late and very dark , I decided to just let him go in the front yard . Oops . He ran through the yard , down the driveway , and back into the garage before I could walk even 5 paces . Learn from me : ) DO N'T DO THAT . Because , now I have to deal with a EDUCATED MOUSE . One who , having returned to the garage , now realizes the trap is a TRAP . I may have to upgrade my bait ; time will tell : ) I still most highly recommend this mouse trap -- it works !	1
I 've owned six different types of rodent traps . This one has been the most consistent . It has even caught two birds ! ( birds were surprised , but uninjured and released healthy ) We have have many species of rodents around our house , but only two create a health problem or damage problem . This trap humanely captures all of them , and allows us to release the non-harmful rodents uninjured . The harmful rodents can then be euthanized humanely . This is the most humane and effective process for small animals I 've found so far . Yes , the trap can trip from strong winds , and yes it can be tripped without a catch . It 's also a one-shot deal so you get one animal per setting . We can live with this - nothing is perfect . The trap can be a little frustrating to set if you 've had too much coffee as well , but you get the hang of it.Update 7/10/12Be careful not to get the `` Grips '' livetrap which is a knock off of Havahart . The trigger wire does not have a flat spot which makes it very difficult to set and it trips without trapping frequently . Grips also appears to fall apart easily . The Havaharts have been catching mice , voles , chipmunks and ground squirrels more effectively than any other trap . Is also completely humane . We 're only after the mice and voles ( they damage things ) so we let the others go without injury . CHECK YOUR TRAPS OFTEN or these become quite IN-humane .	1
We left a bag of cat food in the garage a few weeks ago and when we went to use it , found a hole in the bag and clear evidence around the bag that a mouse had done the deed ( think about that one for a minute and you 'll know what I mean ) .We bought this trap and caught one mouse the first night and a second mouse the day after . We used peanut butter as our bait and it seemed to do the trick.Getting my hand inside to bait the trap was a tight fit ( it 's a small trap ) . Plus , the trap triggers easily so getting it right the first time was impossible - every time I put it down , it triggered itself . It took a few tries but eventually , I was able to set it and put it down on the garage floor without the doors slamming shut.Getting the mouse out was another challenge . First , a mouse poops a lot and since they ca n't get a hall pass and use the restroom , well , it 's pretty unappealing to have to deal with the trap . I put the trap in a box , hauled it to the woods and shook the mouse out - uninjured , of course.Cleaning out the trap was the final step - I hosed it out with a garden hose.It 's a simple , cheap and humane way to catch and remove a pest . It is a bit tricky to set and bait but the end result is a live mouse outside the garage . Win/Win !	1
Havahart 1020 - Small rodentsI have a larger Havahart from about 20-25 years ago that works to this day and is able to catch squirrels without any difficulty . The wire mesh on that model is too big for small field mice , so I bought this 1020 to hopefully catch some of these smaller mice and rats . They tend to crawl into my engine compartment and store seeds or other rubbish.The 1020 is quite small and light weight . Its construction is n't very good , everything seems thinner and lighter than the older design . The bait tray is easily sprung . A gust of wind will set it off , and it renders it useless in windy conditions outside . Understandably , a field mouse is going to be quite light so a heavier trap may not spring when the mouse touches the tray . Unfortunately , this also makes the 1020 very touchy . I recommend using it indoors or in a covered area close to the suspected location of the critters.Overall : 4/5 stars , the construction could be better , but time will tell	1
These work perfecctly - they are a bit sensitive to set but these are trapping at least a mouse a day in my garage .	1
After months of battling a pesky mouse situation we actually NAMED our lil wild friend after he dashed across my foot one night during a trip to the bathroom ... ! ! This trap succeeded in humanely capturing one Mr. Bo Jangles so he could be relocated to a nearby field ! ! After reading numerous reviews of various humane traps here on Amazon , I finally settled on this trap and the metal 12 catch mousetrapJ.T . EATON 421CL `` REPEATER '' MULTIPLE CATCH MOUSE TRAP . I 'll admit , once these traps arrived I was really impressed with the multi-catch trap which APPEARS to a very awesome trap and was VERY easy to bait ! Mr. Bo Jangles never ventured anywhere near the multi-catch trap , , perhaps the strong stench of machine oil present ... thankfully the Havahart trap did not have the offensive odor . Additionally I had to modify the Multi-catch trap as it would have easily released any entrapped mouse with a simple nose press on the upper lid ... The Havaheart trap looked weak and appeared difficult to set , I seriously had doubts initially . I admit I played with the trap awhile and made a number of minor adjustments to the trap before baiting it with a piece of Granola Bar which I `` glued '' to the bait table with a nice chunk of peanut butter . Once baited , I found a quiet closet in which Bo Jangles had previously been spotted and set it in the middle of the closet floor . AFTER setting the trap in place and being sure this was `` the place '' did I attempt to actually set the previously baited trap.I gave this Havahart trap a 5 star rating despite the written instructions being less than ideal since it caught our lil friend in less than a week . Just play with the trap awhile and understand how it works before relying on it to catch your mice . Also understand that it may need a few minor adjustments due to being bounced around in shipping.I wish to thank the Reviewer who provided sane advice for a wise method for releasing the trapped mouse . As a reminder , when releasing the mouse open the door that is AWAY from you ! ! In our case , I took the trap to a local field along with a reliable stick . I set the trap in the field and used the stick to gently remove the door lock of the door AWAY from me thereby allowing the mouse to nose his way through door . Using the stick I had to gently move the trap over on the side to allow the mouse an easier time of releasing itself from the trap but at least I did n't have a mouse running up my coat sleeve ! ! ; - )	1
This trap worked great and caught the mouse the first night I put it out . I was then able to release it easily in a nearby field . I have tried many other catch and release traps and the Havahart models seem to always work the best for me . I have used them to catch mostly mice and voles , but I would imagine they all work just as good for catch and release pest control .	1
I just bought an emergency back-up generator . It 's just like a snow thrower . It you buy it , you probably will never need it and it becomes another gas-fired device that needs maintenance . Unfortunately , we need both . Ocassional power outages and significant snow storms here in Maryland do happen . Even though we hopefully will never have another 40 & # 34 ; monster storm like the one a few winters ago , we do have frequent violent storms enough to justify the generator and I just about wore out my snow thrower on that one storm alone . I think we 're do for more . Hence the generator cover .	1
Bought this for my 10KW Generac portable generator , and it does the job . Covers the engine and generator , and if you 're patient , you can even leave the handles exposed through the corner slits in the cover . Seems adequately strong with well-sewn seams - should last a long time , and it 'll keep my generator warm and dry over the winter.Definitely recommended for any large portable generator .	1
This generator cover is superb in every fashion . It fits my largest generator ; easy on and off . I will be purchasing another for second generator in a different State .	1
Fits the champion 41135 generator just fine and seems like its good quality and will last through weather and storms .	1
This thing covers my generator just fine . It shows no sign of wear or coming apart after using it for months .	1
The storage seat comes as six heavy duty plastic panels that snap together . Once assembled it is strong and sturdy . The lid/seat is hinged and overlaps the box so rain is kept out . The bottom is raised on short legs which also helps keep out moisture.We use it to hold a large bag of charcoal , lighter fluid , and a small fire extinguisher . All the things necessary for a successful barbecue.UPDATE 7/8/11 - Over a year later and the storage seat is still going strong . One thing has changed though . We 've gave up using lighter fluid and are instead using aWeber 87886 Chimney Starter . It works perfectly and there 's no `` lighter fluid '' smell.UPDATE 10/25/26 - A few more summers past and the storage seat continues to do it 's job . In fact , our first few barbecues each spring use the charcoal that 's been outside sitting in and protected by the seat all winter with no problems.BTW , I feel that honest , effective reviews take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping . I 've always appreciated the help I 've gotten from other reviewers and continue to return the favor as best as I can .	1
I use it on my front porch for my deliveries . works perfect . if it gets dirty , a little rince from the hose and all is good .	1
When I was looking for a nice storage box for my front porch -- I ordered this product based on the other reviews . They were right ! It WAS easy to put together . Less than 2 minutes , no tools , no kidding . It 's very sturdy and doubles as overflow seating when necessary . Very handy . I even went back and ordered the larger one . One note on the color : It 's more of a light taupe than the whiteish tone you see in the picture . No matter . I highly recommend it .	1
It took all of 5 minutes to assemble except for the top . That took about 4 more minutes to figure out . This product literally snaps together - no tools needed except for the top which they claim just snaps on like the other pieces . Maybe if your a body builder you have the strength to bend the tab by hand but I couldn't.There is a simple solution - after sliding the right side hinge into place - use a medium sized flat blade screw-driver inserted between the tab and the hinge and carefully bend the hinge back toward the right and slide the hinge over the tab and your done.I doubt that if left out in a heavy rain-it would be water tight - but that is not an issue for me since I am using it to store ceramic & stainless steel accessories for my Ceramic Egg Grill/Smoker .	1
This came screamingly fast , and I do n't even use the two day shipping option . I put it together in about five minutes , after I figured out how to attach the lid . It seems fairly sturdy , but I 'm about 175 pounds , and I 'm not sure about sitting on it , but I put a cushion on top , and the cat will probably sleep there . Some time ago I purchased a larger patio storage container which my husband immediately took over for storing the pool chemicals . This made me reluctant to store the patio cushions in it , which was the reason that I had purchased it . Recently Amazon put this one on sale with with super saver shipping . My husband liked the idea of having this container solely for the pool chemicals , and so did I . This one will hold a large tub of chlorine tablets , plus two half gallon containers that hold liquid , and his pool testing box , with room to spare . I now have the larger one back for my cushions and pool floats , so everyone is happy . August 28 , 2007 postscript : I put a cushion on this , and my husband , who weighs 205 pounds , sat on this without causing a problem , so it 's more sturdy than I thought .	1
This is a really easy to assemble box that is just right for my gardening supplies . We have it on the front balcony of our floating home . It looks just fine and does n't detract from the look of the front of our house , which is in a high traffic tourist area so we try to keep it looking nice . So far it 's been rain proof and has worked out really well . I recommend it for anyone needing a bit of storage in a smaller outdoor space .	1
Makes a great little seat , keeps the contents dry . I store a 5gal bucket in here with my grilling tools and it fits perfectly with some room to the side for other stuff . This is great for us on our small balcony since it is both a seat and storage . It is sturdy enough to stand on , and it keeps the weather out well . Great value !	1
I use this to keep some gardening tools and a soccer ball in for easy access . Works well , and supports my 250lbs just fine as well . Keeps contents dry so far .	1
I bought this storage product to keep rock salt in this winter . It arrived today and I had it assembled in just a few minutes . Although they say no tools are necessary for assembly , and while it might be true for a strong man who can get that second hinge to seat properly , it was n't true for me . I had to use a flat-head screwdriver to pry the final hook over far enough so it could snap back and catch the hinge ( when you have the instructions in front of you , you 'll know what I mean ) . It was no big deal to do that . I just want to point out that weaker people may need to resort to using a prying tool.The storage bin seems to be well-engineered for easy assembly ( other than that one pesky hinge ! ) and ideal for standing up to whatever weather Mother Nature dishes out . For me , it arrived just in time because later tonight I 'll be outside shoveling the walks and then putting down salt.Bottom line : It 's nice to find an economical product that does what it 's supposed to do , especially when it also manages not to be an eyesore.Update a year or so later : The lid has developed a bit of a warp or twist making it unable to close fully ( there 's a narrow strip of empty space when the lid is down , showing that it is n't all the way down where it needs to be to rest on the edge of the container ) . For my use , that 's not a big deal , but it would have been better if that change had n't taken place . For that reason , I 'm taking a star off what was originally a 5-star review .	1
I bought this to store bird seeds on the front porch . It 's the perfect size to hold a variety of seeds with room for suet cakes and hummingbird nectar . The piece snaps together easily but securely . You may need a rubber mallet to get the top on but it 's worth it . The best part ... it 's made in the U.S .	1
I bought a Suncast SS1000 Storage Seat to place out back to hold the bags of dog treats I always have out there . I had considered getting a plastic storage bin to keep birds and rain out of the treats but this is a much nicer solution ! It 's roomy enough to hold at least three 5 to 10 lb bags of dog biscuits , and it keeps them nice and dry and safe from other critters.It require no tools to assemble , and went together in less than a minute . The lid is hinged and lifts easily , and when closed it slightly overlaps the base to keep rain out.I have a Suncast deck box which has stood up to the elements for a couple years now and still looks great ( no easy trick here in the Arizona desert ) so there 's no doubt this storage seat will do the same.Although I use mine for dog treats , you could easily use it to store garden tools , a hose , toys , pool supplies , or anything you 'd like.I 'm pleased with it and give it two thumbs up .	1
We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However , my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter . The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them , leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season . I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water . They get some bits added too.This product works well . A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard .	1
To be honest , I actually purchased this product for fungus gnats in my houseplants from the potting soil and not for mosquitoes outside . I 've been using a product called Gnatrol -Gnatrol WDG - 60 grams ( which Amazon used to sell ) but ran out of it . Needing a quick fix , it 's commonly known that mosquito dunks/pellets contain the same active ingredient in Gnatrol ( the BTI bacteria ) .I bought this because my herb garden I started had an infestation from a newly purchased bag of potting soil . From the herb garden , the infestation of gnats slowly started migrating to my other houseplants . I thought I could take care of them all with this product , but the warnings on the package says to keep away from food sources and to not ingest it . So using it on my herb garden was a chance I did n't want to take.I ended up using this just for my house plants and I can attest the fact that it does work on killing fungus gnat larva . However , the reason I give it 4 stars is because you ca n't use it on indoor edible plants ( like my herb garden ) .Luckily , Amazon started selling Gnatrol again so I ended up buying another container ( which is actually safe for vegetables/crops/edibles ) . So now rather than using all my gnatrol on vegetables/herbs/houseplants alike , I can save money by using Gnatrol on my edibles and these mosquito bits on my decorative houseplants .	1
We have skeeters terrible down here in Texas . When it rains sometimes we get these standing water holes and I sprinkle this in them and it seems to help . Non toxic makes it the only way to go as well .	1
I 'm on my 3rd bottle of this in the last four years . It works very well . I can treat standing water in a variety of scenarios . Dosage is dependent on surface area not volume of water . The active ingredient is toxic only to mosquito larvae so pets and wildlife are unaffected . I collect a lot of rainwater and could n't do without this product , now .	1
I 've used these for years in water gardens around my yard and they work very well and do not hurt the birds or any other animal as far as I can tell . If you look into a water feature and see something wriggling that look like small shrimp , you need these as those are mosquito larva .	1
I have a lot of aquatic plants outside and was worried about the pots becoming a mosquito breeding ground . I sprinkled this in the pots and have n't seen any little squirmies . The bits are the best way for me too go as I did n't need a whole & # 34 ; dunk & # 34 ; for each pot and that would end up being expensive . I also sprinkled these bits in an area where I found some water had leaked leaving a temporary swamp . No skeeters there either .	1
This is one of many products in our arsenal to keep the nasty biters in control . We reapply every couple of weeks or after a typical TX . downpour into drains , wet areas in our yard . Even when we run the sprinkler system , it 's still lasts a couple of weeks-and you do n't need to use alot . It works really well .	1
Although I have read reviews about woman appreciating the size , as a man I also have small hand . Although I usually work with much larger tools , it is great to have pruners that fit exactly in my hands . These pruners are light which means I can now work for a longer period without hand fatigue . And lastly these are professional , well made , `` last for life '' pruners .	1
First off , these cut WAY better than any other shears I own . Friskars seem like children 's safety scissors by comparison . They cut through dead thick woody canes with ridiculous ease . My only complaint is that they are meant for small MENS hands , not women 's hands.I have average sized lady 's hands . Typical caucasian size , I guess size small glove and a size 5 ring . These clippers are still almost too big to keep a grip on when you open the blades . Essentially , if you hold your hands as if to grip imaginary clippers , as wide as you can , if this gap measures less than 4 & # 34 ; , there is no way you 're going to be able to open/close these clippers fully with gloves on . They barely fit my hands bare , and with gardening gloves , I have to adjust my grip so my middle , longer , finger is doing the closing action . My index finger is too short to wrap around the handle without sliding off . The handles are not especially grippy , they 're smooth rubber . So , unless they are small enough for your fingers to really wrap around them solidly , you will have to adjust your grip awkwardly .	1
I returned this pruner . The latch is very difficult to turn . Once open , the pruner works smoothly . I 'm a small-ish man and I found the grip comfortable enough . But - I bought a Fiskar pruner for half the price and it works fine . It seems made for two grip positions , depending on whether you have large or small hands . Any , this is probably a good , albeit expensive , pruner - if you want to spend the afternoon with WD-40 working the latch loose .	1
After 50 years of gardening I have yet to find better quality pruners . This model is great for small or arthritic hands . Very sharp . All parts replaceable although not inexpensive .	1
I have owned and used dozens of pruners , some cheap , some expensive , but none better than my Felco pruners ! Actually , by spending a bit more I have saved quite a lot of money . My first pairs were my grandmothers . I have no idea how old they were but it must have been over twenty five years . They were as good as new . I live in a house in the country and we keep almost seven acres park-like with flower gardens , fruit trees , grapes and the like . It is a very large task keeping this place up between the two of us . I did purchase the F-6 as my hands are rather small ; strong , but alas small and I found these to fit them better . My old set from my grandmother are larger and after several hours do tire my hands.These are well made and perfectly balanced and their cutting power is tremendous . I have owned several of the cheap pruners and they last maybe one season . I have no doubt that I will be using this new pair for quite a number of years to come . As has been pointed out in other review , there are a lot of look-a-likes available and are quite inexpensive . Do n't be taken by this . Look for the brand and go ahead and spend the extra dollars . They are worth every penny and will save money in the long run.I am , I promise you , extremely picky about my gardening tools and yard care tools . I put them to work ! I have been more than satisfied with these pruners and have no doubt that I will purchase another if the need should ever arise .	1
I bought this to test the pH of my blueberry soil that I have in half wine barrels . I used 1/3 pine bark mulch , 1/3 sphagnum peat moss , and 1/3 organic potting soil . I mixed it all up well and checked the pH a few weeks later . This quick little kit gave me indication I was at around a 6 . I wanted to drop it a bit further so I added some organic acid fertilizer , waited close to 2 months and rechecked . My soil is now around 4.5 to 5 . The blueberry bushes love it and they are green ( not red and yellow now ) , growing fast , and have tons of flowers ! + Water Dropper Included+ Simple Instructions+ No Mess+ Consistent Results+ Takes about 2-3 minutes to take a sample and get a reading+ Small Booklet providing details of many different plants , vegetables , and flowers and the soil pH they grow best in_Bottom Line_ Yes , I would recommend this pH kit over other products , such as a soil probe . In my experience this is the fastest , most consistent , easiest way to get an accurate idea of what the pH is . This kit really helped me get my blueberry bushes up and going and I will continue to use the test kit to monitor my soil pH .	1
Soil from different areas of the yard test a bit differently , and I got repeat results . This would indicate the tests are at least consistent and sensitive enough to be of use . I 'm happy to at least have a good idea of the soil and do n't have to worry that it is way off . Since a couple of fruit trees were not so hot , I wondered about that . As it turns out , all my areas are a bit acidic , so I amended the soil and hope for good results.What people say about the small capsules is true . Pretty darn tiny and probably very difficult for many people to use without spilling . What would bigger capsules cost ? Nothing probably.Five stars if it would also kill gophers and weeds .	1
Inexpensive , this kit consists of ten single use tablets . Instructions are clear and the contents -- a vial , ten test tablets and an eye dropper for water -- are well-designed . For the price , it provided me peace of mind on my growing conditions and prevented me from pH conditioning the soil where it did not need conditioning.On the downside , readings are not precise . You 'll get a good idea of the general soil pH within a .5 reading , but nothing specific . That 's probably okay , however . Most times soil conditions are not exact from place to place anyhow and a general idea is what most of us need .	1
It 's not a difficult task to assess your soil type . Just moistening it and checking out how it molds and feels in your hands will easily tell you whether it is sandy , silty , or clay-like . However , you ca n't check out its pH level of acidity or alkalinity just by looking at it or holding it in your hands . For example , if you are planning a strawberry bed , an optimal pH level would be 6.0 to 7.0 . On the other hand if you want carrots , an optimal pH level would be 5.0 to 6.0.The rapitest pH soil tester is not unlike many others on the market , but is a good one . It comes with ten pH capsules , a dropper , full directions as to how to use them ( very simple ) , and a color chart to compare your results . The pH level chart ranges from pH level 4.5 ( very acid ) to pH 7.5 ( alkaline ) .When you test your soil , make sure that you use distilled water as tap water can skew your results . This little kit is quick and easy and will help you decide not only what to plant in a particular location , what nutrients you need to add to the soil according to the pH , and enable you to gauge the health of your plants throughout the growing season . The best time to use this inexpensive kit would be in the spring and after harvest time .	1
It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil ( outside for the most part ) .The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color . You do need ph 'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with . If you use tap , you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water . For the price and complexity it is well worth it . Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement .	1
No only is this little soil pH tester include easy to follow and use instructions , but it also includes a fantastic guide for what pH level is ideal for growing a vast list of vegetables , flowers , trees , shrubs and grasses . I love this guide so much I 'm laminating it ! This tester has been priceless for preparing my raised vegetable beds and getting the pH just right for each bed 's corresponding planting .	1
I had been using this kit til I looked on amazon for refills and found none . I did n't want to buy another kit so I researched test strips . The test strips work the same and are waaay cheaper . I 'm using my container that came in this kit but a cup to mix soil and water in would work just fine .	1
It works and is more reliable than a test probe thingy provided you follow the instructions . These have been the standard for years and you ca n't go wrong if you do it right . This can mean three tests per area to be tested but you will know for sure . It only tests PH . If you want to know more get a more complex test.Robs Rating : Fiddly but it works .	1
I love this hedge trimmer ! I have a fair number of bushes and hedges that need trimming , but always hated having to trim them mainly becuase of the tools . I had a corded model ( also a B & D ; ) that cut very well , but the cord was always a real pain -- it always got snagged on something , and I ended up spending more time dealing with the cord than actually trimming . Looked into a gas model , but the weight was an issue , as well as the noise.The cordless B & D ; is a fantastic tool ! It lets you concentrate on the trimming . Ready to go in a second ( no cord to unwind and plug in ) and the battery lasts a decent interval . No , it 's not an everlasting battery that will run for hours , but that 's an easy problem to solve -- just get a second battery so if the first one gives up before you 're done , you just pop in another.Nicely balanced and easy to handle . Highly recommend ! !	1
Great product ! ! Works great . I have trimmed many hedges with this little machine , and it holds it 's charge throughout the job . Not too heavy , and easy to maneuver . Very pleased I bought it .	1
This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house . Uses the same 18V battery as my B & D ; drill , so it 's nice to have a spare if I need it . First time I used it , I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out . Instead , I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done . I 've never used a corded trimmer , but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord . This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery . Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment ( do n't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building ) , and keep it charged . If the trimmer does n't run for long right out of the box , you probably have a defective battery .	1
I do n't have a lot of hedges but I 'm pretty sure one battery could get thru most tract-home sized yards with no problem . It cuts well , light & easy to use , is n't terrible on battery use . I 've had this a couple years , still no problems at all .	1
I bought the B & D Cordless Hedge trimmer a few weeks ago based on the comments made by the people here in the reviews . I am very pleased with my purchase . I found the power to be adequate for trimming shrubs around the yard . I did n't find the weight a problem as did some who reviewed it . The safety lock is an inconvenience . As some did , I fixed it to where it would stay in the locked position . It makes a big difference . Time will tell how the batteries will hold up . So far I have no complaints . I would recommend this trimmer	1
Makes the job a lot easier . Used to have to run 100 ' of extension cord from the garage then wrestle it around like an Anaconda all over the yard . Cord would come unplugged and I had to constantly be on my toes to not cut across the cord.Cuts a nice even line right where I want it and it has reduced the time I spend messing with yard work .	1
I 've been using the cordless broom since April and am very pleased with it . In the past , after mowing I would drag out a broom to sweep and clean up the sidewalk . It also serves to clean off grass and leaves from my mower ... again I had used a broom on that too . I keep the batteries at the ready and so far have n't needed both during one session , but like knowing I have a back up . It has really been a big help .	1
I love this little blower ! I can grab it at a moment 's notice and blow the leaves , pine needles , and other debris out of my courtyard . SOOO much easier than dragging out the corded electric blower for quick light jobs ! Fits my `` girl hands '' nicely , not too heavy , not too noisy , lasts about 15 minutes . For the big jobs , I 'll still get out the `` monster '' electric blower that works like a hurricane coming through , but with this little guy I find myself blowing leaves and stuff frequently now , instead of dreading getting out the big one for a small job . I 'm going to look at the other items they make that uses the same battery pack too .	1
I know most will not believe this and it is likely Black & Decker may not either but prior to owning this Electric Broom or smooth surface sweeper as it is called I owned the B & D Sweepstick you may never have seen one but it was a surface blower unit not much noise but good clearing action . The batteries were not renewable all was built in and you simply plugged one end of the charger to a wall recepticle and the other end into the tool and kept it there when not in use . That Sweepstick lasted for over 20 years I don'r have to worry about this one lasting that long cause I wo n't but the new one I just purchased does as well as the last one I had and that is all I can ask for . It wo n't blow the shingles off the roof but is plenty strong enough for driveways , walkways , porches and decks . I use it for blowing out the garage as well and it has no problem doing all of this on one charged battery and has power to spare . I can and do handle the big blowers , string trimmers , chain saws and pole saws but I can say the Black & Decker folks have captured the market in light duty battery operated tools . No messing with gas and oil except to lubricate the blades and just plug and play or work . Thanks to Black & Decker for the tools and to Amazon.com for making them affordable to us older folks.Sincerely , Denny	1
Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces . While it does n't have the power of my 230 mph corded one , there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the `` high power '' blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs . Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it 's dry , this little guy gets in between the bush 's , shrubs , plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard , saving a few hours of raking .	1
I 've had this electric broom for about a year . It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me . I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess . It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I would n't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy . I do n't own another blower and do n't expect to because I do n't feel I need to . In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B & D ; tools that use the same type of 18V battery . All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools . This is a successful design that is flexible for our use .	1
Still works same as when I first bought it . It 's not a high-powered blower , and it will go thru the battery pretty quick , but if you want to just grab a blower to blow off your patio or driveway without dealing with cords or anything this is great . I 've got a ton of concrete around my front and back yards and two batteries does the trick . If for some reason I want something really high-powered I will pull out the old corded blower , but it 's rare . My common use is blowing off sidewalks after mowing the grass .	1
I have another B & D ; 18 V product , a tree pruner that only came with one battery . Amazon has a pretty good price on the battery at 32 bucks , but then I saw this unit which comes with 2 batteries and another charger for 6 bucks more than the cost of two batteries ! So now I have two 18V tools and 3 batteries with 2 chargers so I 'll never find myself running out of juice again ! Great Deal ! Oh the blower is not advertised as a leaf blower , so do n't expect the power of of corded or gas unit . But as others have noted it works great on the deck and patio with low noise and no smell of a gas engine.2010 update - it appears that B & D ; now includes only one battery with this unit . Perhaps they realized it was too good a deal or people were not buying the batteries alone . That 's a shame because I would NOT buy this unit with only one battery . You need at least two to get any work done , run time is not great and of course worsens as the batteries age .	1
I love these B & D products . I have four items that take the same interchangeable battery . I have the radio charger , and keep the radio plugged in , so the battery is always fully charged . The broom does a good job keeping my sidewalk/driveway clean , especially after mowing . It 's just so easy to use .	1
You can not compare this to a corded electric leaf blower , it is n't even marketed for that . It is a great replacement for a broom however and for that it works great.We have a 50 foot porch which is always in need of a sweep after even a light wind . Needles , leaves , pieces of cones always seem to make their way , it is a constant battle . Using a broom takes too much time to do everyday as is taking the time to get out the cord and electric blower which is overkill . This little blower works perfectly . So easy to use I just grab it and flip the switch . I can have the porch clean in about a minute . Works well for the patio and garage too . As a bonus I was recently surprised to find it worked well blowing the needles off our roof , another issue we have to deal with every summer.I have a couple of batteries . I always leave one in the charger , the batteries last a bit longer when I do.If you have a lot of sweeping to do this is a great tool !	1
Works great although I can tell the battery power does n't last as long as the trimmers , etc . For my long driveway I usually bring a second battery along	1
The purchase from Amazon was flawless ; the trimmer was on by front porch within three days of the order placement . Amazing . Be careful opening the box . I got a nasty paper cut in my eagerness to rip off the box top with brute force . Inside the box everything was expertly packaged and protected with egg carton quality cardboard shell.Luckily operating the machine is simple because the direction sheet leaves much to be desired . It displays as many languages as a United Nations guide , but all in small print , all directions overly succinct . What you need to know is on the direction sheet but not necessarily easy to find because of a lack of clarity and organization.The small pictures provided require the use of a magnifying glass . The pictures are n't annotated with text , just numbered sequentially.In the YardWhen one buys a yard toy he does n't really need , especially one that costs a hundred dollars , expectations and hopes are high . To this reviewer 's relief , Black and Decker 's cordless trimmer exceeds all expectations and far surpasses any preconceptions of performance and utility . Without clear directions I did have a bit of difficulty attaching the tool 's handle , but after that little chore it was all uphill.So far this handy trimmer has performed flawlessly from one end of Spud Acres to its brother . On one charge I trimmed the front beds , the edges of the asphalt driveway , and most of the beds in the backyard . With extra batteries it 's a snap to replace a spent battery with a fresh one . With the batteries included with my other Black and Decker cordless yard tools , and the Firestorm 18V battery bought recently , I have 6 batteries for the three tools . Even if a battery is attached to each tool , I still have two fresh batteries on standby on the chargers.RecommendationThis tool easily rates five stars . It 's quieter than my other two trimmers , has more than adequate power for my needs , and is easy to maneuver . At first I thought that the pull down edge guide was a useless gimmick , but it actually works very well . Also the automatic line-feed feature is wonderfully convenient.NOTES - Be sure to remove tape from the line cutter and the spool . This bit of advice is not mentioned in the directions.I bought three spools of prewound line when I bought the trimmer , but learned from the directions that one can use bulk line to rearm an empty spool . I like the convenience of using spools ready to use .	1
Easy to use cordless blower . Loved the fact that I do not have to grapple with cords while in the yard and it definitely beats using the scrapper broom to clear leaves off my front yard.However , it would be better if the battery was longer lasting as I find that I have to recharge after blowing just half my deck ( which is probably a full deck for most houses ) .	1
Great little machine . For less than 100 bucks you get a trimmer that does a good job . Can be used as an edger also . I do n't have large property but I can use this maybe 3 times before charge runs out . They give you two batteries with it and you can always have the backup charged and ready . Why mess with gasoline and mixing oil . Just turn this on and go . Very light weight and easy to manuever . Can adjust the height to suit your needs and no bumbing to advance the string . More convienent than gas or electric and not alot of money .	1
No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it 's time to do some yard trimming . This thing is light weight , strong enough for moderate trimming , and no gas or cords to deal with . It 's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill , use it , plug it back in ... use it again . It 's the ease of it all that makes it a winner . If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc ... go for the cord , but for maintenance around the yard ... this is it !	1
I live in one of those communities that have common grounds which are kept up by a service ; as a result , I only have to tend the grounds in and around my house . I used to have to lug a power cord out to do it . With this device , though , I can charge it up overnight and then bounce outside for perhaps 3 minutes of effort at the most . You have not experienced convenience until you 've had the luxury of no gas and pullcord startup or long troublesome power cord , just a battery powered tool . It is definitely not for large estates , but for simple short jobs , it is perfect .	1
I can not believe that I am using the same animal others have reviewed . I looked on the box to be sure . This is my third year and it is still working as well as the first time I tried it . I have a small lawn and what used to be reachable by mower is now only reachable by trimmer . With all the compost I use and other earthy products , the lawn has risen above the driveway and sidewalk . By using the `` Groom 'N ' Edge '' button to rotate the trimmer head 180 degrees to convert the trimmer to an edger , I not only groom the lawn but also cut away the overflow dirt . Maybe this is why I seem to use more Black & Decker AF-100 String than the average reviewer . I think this thing will never fall apart ; if it does I will go cordless .	1
First of all , I love this trimmer . I have had it less than a year , so I ca n't comment on durability , but it is very light , and very easy to use.The handle adjusts for perfect balance . You can ( and I often do ) use this trimmer one-handed , then switch hands.This item is very light , very easy to use , and very quiet . No noise from a gas motor , no hassle of dragging around very long extension cords.The trimmer string advances automatically , so there 's no need to mess around with the spool or tap the trimmer to advance the line.The head pivots so you can switch back and forth between edger and trimmer modes in seconds.I use this for edging , weed eating , and to cut grass on a steeply sloped portion of lawn . It works great.When the battery is at full charge , this item has decent power . Shortly before the charge is gone , there is a sharp drop in power , which lets you know it 's time to switch batteries and plug the one you 're using into the battery charger . The unit comes with two batteries and one charger.My only complaint is that the batteries only hold a charge for about 15 minutes , after which it takes 9 hours to recharge them . The unit comes with two batteries and one charger . So you can do your front yard one morning , and your back yard the next , if you remember to swap out the battery being charged before you go to bed.If the unit came with four batteries and two chargers ( or if the batteries held charges longer or took less time to recharge ) , this item would be perfect.Update after two years : After one year , the batteries only last 5 minutes . After a year and a half , they do n't work at all . Replacement batteries are very expensive . The Black and Decker replacement battery I bought was better than the originals , but only holds a charge for a short period of time after a few months of use . The third party NiMH ( not NiCad ) battery I bought has been the best of all , but it originally lasted 30 minutes and now is down to 15 or 20 after a few months of use . The replacement battery charger I bought charges batteries in two to three hours instead of nine , but the two original batteries have died since I started using the new charger , and the replacement batteries are fading fast.I still like the trimmer a lot , but the batteries are so expensive , I will buy a different when these batteries die out . I hope they last the rest of the year .	1
I have been sold on Black & Decker for years I have a corded string trimmer that still works as good as new that is well over 20 years old the same can be said for half inch chuck corded drill well over 20 years for it and it is used often . I had a B & D sweep stick internal battery type that lasted 22 years and last month I bought the cordless pole saw and like it so much I decided to get the trimmer and once again have used it twice and very satisfied with its ability to get the job done . Since it is a single line trimmer and the smaller diameter line it would not be good in heavy thick weeds but ideal for grass trimming and very easy to handle it is a very well balanced tool and you can not beat the price at Amazon and even better you get the extra battery . I can tell you a local big box store in our town which is well known around the world for cheap prices is asking $ 16 more for this same item and $ 40 for the batteries . If you want to look at it from my view point you are buying the batteries and getting the trimmer free .	1
Here 's my usage : 1 acre surrounded with chain link fence - and I have to do both sides ; plus 200 feet of concrete driveway ; three out-buildings ; 16 trees , posts , etc . ; another couple hundred feet of shrub beds.First - chain link fence and trimmers do not play nicely together . Prior to this trimmer , a trip through this yard with electric or gas meant several reels of line . With this trimmer - slightly more than one reel ! I 've had this for the entire 2008 mowing season . It does a better job of actually trimming along the fence than any gas or electric trimmer I have used in the last 35 years - period.Second - power is not an issue unless you are trying to clear heavy stuff that has n't been kept trimmed.Third - battery charge leaves a lot to be desired ; it takes a long time to re-charge and extra batteries are expensive . It takes about six batteries worth to do all that we have to do . I 've solved this by buying their tiller ( see review ) and a second trimmer . I now have 5 batteries and three chargers . The second trimmer actually cost very little compared to the price of two batteries.Fourth - I 'm 63 with a bad back - the trimmer is well balanced and the weight is no problem .	1
Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home . As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we 're never out of power . It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat . Light and easy to use , just pick-up and go . The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done ! Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit , or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it . Or ( ok , I admit it ) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust .	1
I purchased this trimmer in May 2008 and I am very happy with it . I have used it about 5 times . The majority of my weed trimming is done by a yard service , but I needed a trimmer for touch up and weed trimmer in areas outside the lawn . It is very nice to put in a battery and go . Battery life is good . I can get about 20 minutes of hard use ( briars , thick weeds ) and about 40 minutes of light use ( grass ) out of a fresh battery . The unit comes with two batteries . I have changed the `` string '' once and it was easy . The trimmer is light and quiet . May experience with the cordless trimmer resulted in me purchasing the B & D cordless pole hedge trimmer . They use the same battery , which is very helpful . All and all very good product , if you understand your getting a light duty trimmer .	1
I love this product ! I have a gas powered trimmer and frankly I got tired of it . I had to have mixed fuel , I had to prime it , I had to start it , it would not start , I had to clean the carburetor , and it was loud ! With this product I plug in a recharged battery and trim around my one acre yard without hassle.The unit came with two 18 volt batteries and I can trim my whole house 3 times on the same battery . I then swap the depleted one out with the new one and recharge the old one . I also like how the shaft of the trimmer telescopes because I am tall . The cutting line automatically advances itself and is always the proper length for maximum cutting speed and power.No mixed gas , much lower noise level , instant start , and no extension cords ! In the time it took to start the old gas unit I am done using this trimmer . This thing cuts a 12 inch path and I can trim my 17 trees , driveway and 500 feet of sidewalk in very quick time . When you use this trimmer you give your lawn that finished look.It comes with a two year warranty and I recommend this product based on my good experience in using it .	1
I got this item as a Goldbox special with free shipping for a nicely discounted price . I do NOT have large swaths of brush or vegetation to trim through , and if you do , look elsewhere . This is a light-duty trimmer best suited to grass and some herbaceous plant stems.It is fairly lightweight , very easy to use , and the two included batteries are a huge plus for me . I was able to trim up around my yard ( ~ 1/4 acre ) along fence lines and flower beds on one battery . I rushed because many other reviewers have commented that the batteries do n't last long enough for them . For my purposes , they are fine and still had enough juice left after I was done . Next time , I 'll take it slower to give them a better test.I 'm still holding out judgment on the Auto-feed spool ; I did n't break the line to a point where I felt there needed to be an advance from the machine . Again , I 'll have to give her a few more trial runs to see if she is line-hungry or not . I feel , at this early stage of ownership , that if you can find this trimmer on sale , and have a small to average ( whatever that is ) sized yard with typical suburban plants growing , you will do well with this device . My only real quibble would be the potential longevity of the NiCad batteries , but some reviewers on here have claimed a life of 3-4 years with them . If I can get that out of this trimmer , I 'll consider it money well spent.By the way , in person this trimmer has a distinctly ... cheap feel to it . It was a point of concern for me at first , but I grew accustomed to it - I feel the light weight just solidifies the fact that this is NOT a brush cutter - just a device best used to hit some stray grass after mowing on a Sunday afternoon in your backyard . Good luck shopping !	1
This is a much better trimmer than the other 4 I 've owned and I highly recommend it for light trimming.Some will be inclined to call me a nut because this is my fourth B & D ; Electric String Trimmer with one exception . This one is battery operated while the others were operated by 100 feet of extension cord . Years ago , I bought my first electric trimmer and was pleased with its operation until it burned up in less than a year and the selling company refused to honor its warranty because I did not have the original receipt . My fault . I threw it away and have not bought one item from that company since . I replaced it with my first B & D ; electric trimmer and away I went . I had to increase the length of cord and now I have over 200 ' of cord to work it . And it worked fine for a few months and it broke . B & D ; took it back with no problem . Another one went south and they replaced it . Each broken trimmer took place within the first year of ownership so my cost was zero except for the handling and packing trash that goes with such a return . The last corded trimmer still works O.K . but the string device will Not move the string when it is time . I have to undo the string container and feed it manually . That doubles my trimming time and is quite a hassle especially during summer . Incidentally , I have a super gas powered trimmer that I use for the distant sections of the yard and for heavier material . It is much more powerful and used on special occasions such as when the deer and other critters stop eating the brush.Sorry for the history but I come to this trimmer with a modicum of experience and patience . This trimmer supports such things as not having to lug that heavy orange cord all around yards of yard . P.S . I have yet to cut the cord with the trimmer . I ca n't believe it either . The box arrived in one working piece . A few cuts to tape and actually reading some of the instructions , plugging in the charger and attaching a battery it was a wait until the next day and away we trimmed ; with ease . I ran the battery down in about 30 minutes of trimming and not counting the walking to time . The next day after the other battery had charged I finished the yard with a little of the juice remaining . I think `` juice '' is slang for battery power . The length adjustment is perhaps one of the best features . One of us is 6'3 '' and the other is 5'5 '' . One size does not fit all so having the ability to increase or decrease the length is quite nice . When it is trimming , not cutting , time a simple twist of the shaft permits a straight line of cutting and it sure looks nice when it 's fresh . I felt so good about the trimmer that I even chunked the box in case it did not work . It works and works well .	1
this works perfectly . i see no reason to have a gas trimmer . at 18v this has tons of power . comes with two batts so never runs out of power . i get approx one month of use for each charge . ive owned it for one season and would recommend to anyone .	1
I 've had this a couple years and have gotten a ton of use out of it . My yard is pretty small , just typical socal tract home sized front/back lawns . On a newer battery I can easily finish the job . It has good speed , does the job no problem . Changing string is very easy . It does n't feel too heavy at all either .	1
This trimmer works like a charm . It is plenty good for trimming needs around the home . The automatic string feature is nice . I was always use to having to tap the trimmer on the ground to advance the string . This you do n't have to do anything . You turn the handle which turns the head to edge the sidewalk . I bought this based on comments made on this website . I am am very happy with this purchase .	1
Bought this for the missus to trim around her flower beds and herb garden and it 's perfect for her . Light , easy to use and a single battery charge is enough for her to trim around 8-10 planting areas without having to swap batteries . She 's thrilled with it and I can now devote my gas-powered ( Ryobi ) whacking and trimming to the more onerous areas of our property .	1
Okay , first for Amazon itself : What a great place to shop ! I 've shopped Amazon for years and have always been extremely satisfied with Amazon 's service - quality , value and so far , perfect customer service.UPDATE : I 've had and used the trimmer for a few months and have found that after using and recharging the batteries a few times , the batteries seem to last a little longer between charges . Still works great and I feel safe in saying that this is a good , if not excellent buy ( still ca n't say it is a `` Hog '' ) .Now for the Trimmer.This is a replacement for a gas powered trimmer and so far , it really works well . I said the trimmer rated a `` qualified '' 5 stars , and here are the caveats:1 . To call this trimmer a `` Grass Hog '' is stretching the truth . It 's more like a grass piglet ; but for me , with a small yard , it works great . However , if you have a really large yard , it may not be what you want . Having had to wait to receive the trimmer , I had a patch of grass ( about 2'x8 ' ) that grew to about 6 '' or 8 '' in height , and really seemed to drag the battery down quickly - fortunately it comes with two batteries.2 . The automatic string feature is nice , but it seems to use way more string than necessary , especially when trimming the curb , sidewalk and driveway ( sounded like it was continually feeding string ) . Again , for a small yard , it works nicely , but if you have a really large yard , just know it is n't a `` HOG '' and will very likely run out of string quickly.Other than those two caveats , it seems to be , for the price , a great little trimmer , and does n't pollute the atmosphere . It does n't require lots of pulling on a starter rope ( along with the associated language necessary to start a stubborn gas trimmer ) , is fairly well balanced , light , almost noiseless and really , a joy to use .	1
I 'd give the Grasshog 5 stars if the battery charge lasted a bit longer -- -it 's a good thing it comes with 2 -- -but overall this is a decent little tool.I 've owned a Ryobi gas powered trimmer for several years that cost about what this B & D ; cordless did . The Ryobi has always been hard to start and it is not very powerful for all the noise and pollution is emits . I have a 4 acre property and only trim the more conspicuous parts of it , but the Grasshog on two charged batteries comes close to having enough power for the job . Although I did n't really expect a cordless trimmer to replace a gas powered one , I find that for most of my trimming needs I 'll be able to leave the Ryobi in the garage -- -and I am very grateful for that . Using a gas trimmer for anything over 20 minutes is a peculiar kind of torture , so the cordless Grasshog is a great substitute.The automatic string feed feature does seem to work so far . The unit is made mostly of plastic in order to keep it light , and I think I 'll need to be more careful with it than with the Ryobi so nothing breaks . For people with typical yard trimming needs this unit should do well , although I 'd say that if you only need to trim right around the house in easy range of an electrical outlet a much cheaper corded model might be fine , and you do n't need to worry about keeping the batteries charged . For those who are considering a gas powered trimmer and who wo n't be cutting brush or large areas , I 'd suggest at least trying out the Grasshog first . If it does the job for you you 'll be doing yourself and your neighbors a big favor .	1
I 'm happy with this trimmer . So much better than the gas one that was hard to start . I have around a 1/4 acre and the trimmer did not run out of juice and handled everything I tried .	1
A lot better than messy gas trimmers for small jobs . No mixing gas & oil and no noise . I still have a dual string trimmer for the big jobs in spring but this 18V trimmer is just right the rest of the summer .	1
The purchase from Amazon was flawless ; the trimmer was on by front porch within three days of the order placement . Amazing . Be careful opening the box . I got a nasty paper cut in my eagerness to rip off the box top with brute force . Inside the box everything was expertly packaged and protected with egg carton quality cardboard shell.Luckily operating the machine is simple because the direction sheet leaves much to be desired . It displays as many languages as a United Nations guide , but all in small print , all directions overly succinct . What you need to know is on the direction sheet but not necessarily easy to find because of a lack of clarity and organization.The small pictures provided require the use of a magnifying glass . The pictures are n't annotated with text , just numbered sequentially.So far this handy trimmer has performed flawlessly from one end of Spud Acres to the other . On one charge I trimmed the front beds , the edges of the asphalt driveway , and most of the beds in the backyard . With extra batteries it 's a snap to replace a spent battery with a fresh one . With the batteries included with my other Black and Decker cordless yard tools , and the Firestorm 18V battery bought recently , I have 6 batteries for the three tools . Even if a battery is attached to each tool , I still have two fresh batteries on standby on the chargers.This tool easily rates five stars . It 's quieter than my other two trimmers , has more than adequate power for my needs , and is easy to maneuver . At first I thought that the pull down edge guide was a useless gimmick , but it actually works very well . Also the automatic line-feed feature is wonderfully convenient.NOTES - Be sure to remove tape from the line cutter and the spool . This bit of advice is not mentioned in the directions.I bought three spools of prewound line when I bought the trimmer , but learned from the directions that one can use bulk line to rearm an empty spool . I like the convenience of using spools ready to use.I like this cordless trimmer so much that my Echo gas trimmer has been gathering dust in the garden shed the past two years .	1
I love this trimmer for every week sprucing up ; it is not powerful enough for heavy duty trimming but does a great job on things I maintain regularly ; with two batteries , there is plenty of trimming time for a large yard	1
I love B & D ; tools and have a variety of 18v tools . I never really owned many gardening tools and decided to buy this and give it a whirl ... no pun intended . : - ) The package comes with 2 18v batteries , a spindle of twine , and the hog it self . Charged one of the batteries for 18 hours or so and off I went to get rid of weeds . PERFECT ... .this worked for about 30 minutes on full power and 15-20 minutes on half power with one full battery.I was impressed ... as the 18v electric broom died in 20 minutes ... I have now used it about a dozen times and my results are exactly the same ... . Replacement twine is avail on Amazon and your your local big store ... : - ) 5/5 - Great Product , Great Value ... especially for us beginners .	1
Free of restrictive power cords , an electric weedwacker is a very convenient tool . Black and Decker 's NST2018 trimmer is very lightweight , and easy to use . With a 12 inch diameter cutting path , the unit is suitable for light trimming , touch ups , edging , and catching small areas missed by a mower . While the motor has enough power for moderate tasks , if you want to trim large areas , or tackle thick , high grass , you probably should look at something more powerful.The trimmer comes with two 18 volt batteries , and you will probably need them both to take on anything except a small job . It is hard to predict how long a battery may last under actual use , but you might get fifteen minutes of run time from a new battery . It is a just a good idea to make sure both batteries are charged up , before you start a job.The 0.065 inch trimmer line feeds automatically , you do n't bang the spool on the ground , or manually feed line . The auto feed system works pretty well , but does get stuck at times . Since the electric motor does not generate higher speeds like a gas motor , the noise level is relatively low . The unit is very light , and vibration is minimal . The trimmer guard is constructed of durable hard plastic , and should not crack under normal use.This trimmer is a great for touch ups and smaller yards . The freedom is wonderful , you are not polluting the air , and your hands wo n't get dirty mixing fuel .	1
Everything that has been said is true . This is perfect for those of us who just need to trim the edge of your lawn or clear some overgrown weeds , but it is no bush hog . It comes with two batteries , each of which probably lasts 15 minutes peak on heavier jobs and maybe longer or lightweight edge trimming . We find this sufficient for our 1/3 acre property , though it usually requires both batteries as we tend to wait too long to trim.If you buy this expecting the power of a gas trimmer , you will be disappointed . If you want a trimmer that just works and makes your yard look great , you will be very happy.We had a Toro gas trimmer that was highly recommended by Consumer Reports for years and I could never start it without the help of my husband . This was very frustrating to me because I primarily care for the gardens . Now the gas powered one sits collecting dust because we both use the battery powered Black and Decker.My main gripe is probably that it is so unattractive and that it does n't go out into the yard and trim without me .	1
This is a good trimmer for my use . I have a small front yard that i use this for and it works well and the battery lasts long enough and the extra battery is great too .	1
Got this a couple weeks ago , and no problems so far . I never tested the temp , but it keeps my seed trays warm !	1
The extra bit of warmth helped germinate my seeds including tropical fruit seeds in northern California . It 's a pretty small mat if you 're super ambitious .	1
This was the way to go for me . I had 4 seedling germination stations and this fit all of them plus I did n't have to pay all too much .	1
I have an amazingly good return ( sprout rate ) on the seeds I planted using this seedling heat mat . What a great idea ! This makes growing from seeds so easy.I 've learned that it helps to soak the seeds in water for 24 hours or so , or follow the instructions on the packet if they have instructions.Then just sprinkle the dirt over them and provide the right amount of heat . The seeds do n't need nutrition at this point , but they do need warm temperatures.I love this product !	1
I have a large bay window with a window seat in my kitchen that gets natural light from three sides . In the spring the seat pads get stashed and out comes and insulated mat that covers the surface , this heat mat , and plant tray with fortified planting material for seedlings or plant cuttings . This mat keeps the plant tray warm and encourages rapid growth without doing much more than keeping the plants warm and fed . In a matter of 3-4 days , the plants sprout and show root growth.I like this mat because I get fast and effective results with this every time I use it . It 's a good product that pays for itself with its success rate and the fact that it makes me feel like a gardening pro .	1
Just what I was looking for . I bought two so I can start all of my seeds for spring/summer planting . While I was using this heat mat , I put styrafoam ( bought at Home Depot ) under it . It worked much better . Germination was much quicker .	1
This little device worked like a charm starting my seeds last winter . I could n't believe how much quicker it took for them to germinate when using this mat . I put it on a timer with my lights and found it easy to use and setup . It kept a nice warm temperature , never getting too hot . Hopefully it will last for quite awhile as I only get to use it a few weeks a year.UPDATE - Year 2 -Seed mat is working as designed again this year . I need to get another one as I have doubled the amount of seeds I am growing . Definitely recommend this product .	1
I very much needed this this heat mat for my germination /cloning box setup.This will help speed up the time and increase success in root development in seeds and clones.A must no matter your growings skill and for a small price for a high chance for success .	1
Very good seedling mat , I used mine with the digital thermometer . It greatly assisted in my seed germination during the winter months . Recommended for those who start their seeds indoors .	1
I bought 2 of these heat mats for my seedlings and they just took off . It does not get overly hot and I used them with the plastic black trays at most garden centers . I could tell the difference between seedlings on the mat and seedlings that did not have a mat in terms of their growth . I would recommend and I plan on buying more .	1
I bought one of these to try in my greenhouse . Also bought the hydrofarm MTPRTC digital thermostat here on Amazon . Great pair together . I put this under the starter tray and the seeds sprouted in no time .	1
These mats ( I bought two ) operate exactly as advertised . I raised an astounding number of seedlings this past spring using these mats . I 'm sure my germination rate was greatly influenced by the use of the mats . Then , after spring , I cleaned them up and am storing them for the next season of use .	1
I 've got two of these and I really like them since it speeds up the amount of time it takes to get cuttings to root . If they were used on a cooler surface like a concrete or wood surface they 'd be perfect as is but running on top of carpet they get a little too warm for my liking . I 'm looking into getting some dimmers for them . I saw them on Amazon once so I just need to hunt them down so I can keep these just a little bit cooler .	1
First year with a mat for the seeds and jeez - what a difference . The starts were popping up so fast . I think the mats really made a difference . I am very excited for that and plan on using them every year . I hope they last .	1
This is the first year I got these when starting my seeds . I should have gotten these years ago ! Instead of only having about 25 % to 50 % of my seeds sprout I have had 97 % of my seeds spout and they are growing faster too . I highly recommend these & they are a reasonable price compared to others too !	1
I used to germinate seeds in flats on top of my refrigerator , but after moving to a new place where this did n't work anymore , I needed something else . I tried germinating some seeds last year without anything special , and while I still had good luck , some took a while to come up , and I knew I could do better with some gentle bottom heat . That 's why I bought this mat ( the 9-by-19.5-in . version , in my case ) for this year.My germination rates seem to have improved from last year , but I was expecting that . If one of the cheaper options ( e.g. , warm place or top of fridge ) does n't work for you or you want more control , you may want to try this . Being new to heat mats , I was n't sure exactly what I needed , so I bought a thermostat , theHydrofarm MTPRTC , just in case . The mat will only raise the temperature about 10-20 degrees above the room , so with my cool apartment , I probably did n't need this ( until I discovered the next trick ) , but I 'm glad I bought it anyway . If you 're as unfamiliar with it as I was , here 's how it works : the thermostat plugs into the wall , then the heat mat plugs into the thermostat . The thermostat has a probe you insert into the soil , and it will turn the outlet on the thermostat ( into which the heat mat is plugged ) on or off as needed to maintain the temperature you set on the thermostat . So , it 's a lot like a timer , but based on temperature instead of time . If you plug the heat mat directly into the wall , it will just stay on all the time , since the mat itself includes no `` regulator '' like this . This is n't inherently bad , but I 'd at least monitor the temperature and compare it to what you want if you do this instead.The `` trick '' I learned , which is also mentioned in the instructions : insulating under the mat helps . My thermostat is now able to keep the mat off for longer than before . I used to have the mat set directly on my counter under the assumption that it would n't dissipate that much heat , but I think I was wrong . Even after the simple step of setting the mat on top of a folded towel , the soil has had an easier time staying warmer , and I 'm saving electricity by not keeping the mat on as much . You may have better luck if you use a sheet of actual insulation , but even a towel underneath showed improvement for me.As a final note , I measured the electricity usage of this with my Kill A Watt meter . As stated , it uses about 17 Watts when on ( which is , in fact , any time it 's plugged in to a live outlet , since there is no switch on the mat itself ) . It 's also UL listed . In summary , I 'm glad I bought this product . It 's working well so far . I have n't had it for that long yet so I ca n't comment on its longevity , but I 'll update this review if it dies unexpectedly .	1
I have used this to help germinate some cucumbers I started indoors in a small greenhouse tent . At night when the grow lights are unplugged the inside get fairly chilly like the rest of the house , but with this heat mat I can leave it on all night and not have to worry about the seedlings . I would say it keeps the inside temperatures a good 10 degrees warmer than without it . I found the cord to be a little short but it 's really no big deal . Before purchasing I compared this with the ones for sale on Gardener 's Supply and this seemed to be much better value for the size .	1
I 've had problems before trying to clone my plants or even with seed . This used with a tray and dome is all it took for a 100 % success rate on all my clones and seeds	1
If you live anywhere where keeping the proper temperature for germinating seeds this is a must , even as your plants grow you 'll see how much better they do with the heat mat	1
I tried this because the idea made sense , and now I 'm a believer . I planted cucumbers , swiss chard , romaine lettuce , squash , watermelon , various tomatoes , etc ... The first cucumber sprouted in 3 days ! . And the other seedlings are doing well . I 'm sure that my potting mix helped as well , but looks like this mat lives up to its promise . I will probably pick up a second mat next year .	1
You can get some pretty good tomatoes if you use good potting soil , water the plants in time and make sure that they do n't get burned by too much sun while young.Yield : Each planter can grow exactly ONE tomato plant so make sure that you choose wisely . At the peak , for a couple of months we could harvest 1 , sometimes 2 large , usually perfect tomatoes on any given days.It IS possible to have some herbs growing on top of the planter.Care : Like I said , water frequently because all water follows gravity so not a lot of it is retained.Take special care not to choke the plant . There is some 'sponge plug ' at the bottom of the planter through which the tomato grows . Make sure that it does NOT squeeze the stem or you may see a vigorous plant growing only to die later because the bottom opening was n't wide enought.Durability : Six out of the 8 planters we used last year can be reused this year . The other 2 developed some cracks and we will not use them again.GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR TOMATOES !	1
My tomato garden is on my patio so space is at a premium . To expand my gardening space last year I added a Topsy Turvy planter . I grew cherry tomatos in it , because they tend to stay more compact and produce a lot of small sweet tomatos.The main down fall of tomatos growing in the topsy turvy planter can be the lack of water because the dirt dries out much quicker than the dirt around tomatoes planted in the ground . To solve this problem I used a drip irrigation system on a timer which released a small amount of water into the plant several times a day . This kept my tomatos very happy and healthy . A drip irrigation system may sound expensive but you can buy a kit for around $ 20 dollarsRain Bird Patio Watering Kit PATIO-KIT . Since everything in containers gets dry fast , I have my entire patio garden watered by a drip irrigation system . After buying a small drip irrigation set up 3 years ago , it has been functioning great each summer and all my vegetables , strawberries , and herbs have been much more productive .	1
I HAVE BOUGHT SEVEN OF THESE AND HAVE PLANTED TOMATO PLANTES IN MARCH AND NOW THEY HAVE BEGUN TO GROW LARGER AND HAVING BLOOMS -- -LOOKS LIKE FUN	1
This is our third year growing tomatoes upside down , so to speak . At first I was dubious , but now we look forward to growing our own tomatoes . We have one for large roma tomatoes and another for small cherry tomatoes . We have to grow these up and away from wild turkeys that roam in our neighborhood looking to eat any and all fresh vegetable shoots . We placed them on an upper deck with a drip system . For optimal growth we have them hanging up against the house so more heat bounces off the house onto the plants ; heat is ideal for growing tomatoes . We regularly trim and pinch off new growth so that all the energy goes into the tomatoes.Four star : These are plastic and are only useable for one year . I have had a couple of the plastic breakdown before the fruit bearing season was over and had to duct tape it back together . We will keep using these for our particular situation . We love our fresh tomatoes .	1
Last year our tomatoes did really well on the south side of our home , but we needed to make room for other things so I decided to give this a try.Out of the box it 's pretty self explanatory as to what you need to do . Open , insert tomato start , fill with potting soil , hang and water . So far my tomatoes are looking great ! They have n't ripened yet , but there are plenty of them on the verge . One important thing is to water often ! It 's easy to forget and if you do n't water enough you wo n't have good results.Overall this is a good product that I think is worth the price , especially if you are limited on your space . The only suggestions I would make are to make sure that you get your tomato start in early . I got busy and put mine in after it had grown quite a bit , not easy at all and more stress on the plant than it needed . Also make sure your hanger is sturdy , with the soil , water and mature plant it becomes quite heavy . **UPDATE**After seeing a recent thread in the Amazon Gold Box Forum I remembered that I had n't come back to post any pictures . Several forum posters complained that the Topsy Turvy was a waste of money and did n't work . I have already had one successful year and expect another one . I just uploaded one , it 's within a week of putting the start . I will continue to add pictures as the plant progresses .	1
This may look like a gimmick to you but it 's not . This planter can actually grow tomatoes and other vegetables . All you need is a sunny place to hang it . If you live in an apartment or otherwise have no garden space , try this . They call it a tomato planter but it actually should be called a vegetable planter . Last summer I grew tomatoes , bell peppers and cucumbers in them . I believe it needs to contain more soil ( larger ) to be an ideal tomato planter . It grew lots of tomatoes but peppers and cucumbers did even better . One trick to know ( not applicable for tomatoes ) - take the top plastic cover off and plant 2 vegetable plants per topsy turvy -- one in the top and one in the bottom .	1
Especially with cherry and grape sized tomatoes . Amazing production , it 's out of the way , well-engineered , they even include a nice big metal hook to hang it with ! The plastic-fabric sides WILL disintegrate in a couple-three years , so do n't expect this to be a lifetime purchase . But it works great , you 'll have more tomatoes than you 'll know what to do with ! I ordered two of these to replace the single one I had bought a couple years ago . Very clever idea , highly recommended ! HINT : do n't use cheap potting soil !	1
my tomato plant have given me a dozen tomatoes . although not large they have been very tasty . i would recommend this item it works very well	1
This does exactly as advertised . The Black Russian Truffle Tomato i put in mine was growing famously . Actually , it 's growth was fairly unprecedented , until ... .the whole thing fell and the plant 's main stem was crushed . See , when the planter is watered properly , it is also incredibly heavy for its size . So , the lesson there would be to make sure whatever you hang it from can hold quite a bit of weight . I would say it needs to be able to hold at least twenty pounds , since the total weight of a fully grown plant with the planter and all the requisite soil and watering will at least end up weighing this much . It might be safer to shoot for 30 pounds though . However , that was a user error problem on my part for not planning properly . The planter itself is great . You cant overwater , as any excess will simply run out the bottom . A good solid and inexpensive purchase .	1
Bought two after watching neighbor 's do fairly well except for watering neglect.This year will have her hang closer to our yard so we can keep eye on it.These two , when set , will be accessible to daily watering as needed . It does n't look to be any 'foam ring ' in these 2 . BUT one can always stir 'foam packing peanuts ' into dirt/potting mixture , which will create some lightness to over all hanging weight , as well as help with water retention.As to Fabric rotting/giving out after one season vs the earlier reviews . Sounds like the typical of past 4 yrs of IMPORTED product where the MFG has reduced the quality of the fabric .	1
This product works as advertised , my tomatoes are doing very well . However , it is VERY heavy when filled with dirt and watered . You need a sturdy hook and place to hang it . I was having problems with it drying out quickly ( granted , I live in New Mexico , where it is quite dry ) even though I had added water absorbing crystals to the soil . I ended up removing the top 6 inches of soil and placing a plastic milk jug in the top . I punched some holes in the bottom of the jug and I fill this with water nearly every day . The water then slowly seeps in to the soil instead of running out the bottom , dripping is reduced and the plant gets the water it needs . I would give it five stars if some system were in place to keep it from dripping so I could use it indoors and if it were a little easier to plant .	1
This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased . I bought one last year and then again one this year . ( The first one still works great ) I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges . So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in.Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature . As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area .	1
I 've been using this to keep plants alive during the frost , I did n't think they could grow anymore because of the cold . This thing makes them grow ! I was surprised . The plants went from about 12 inches tall to about 18 inches . I keep the light on for about 16 hours a day , and if it 's warm enough outside I put them out there on a roller.My only con is that the frame could be built better , other than that it 's great if you have a few plants you need to keep alive during the winter . It 's good even if you want to start plants .	1
I have a small greenhouse and I 'm using this Grow Light to keep my vegetables going . It provides light in Winter to 5 Earthboxes full of vegetables . Does it work ? I have 5 planters full of vegetables , some blooming getting ready to fruit , and some squash and cucumbers with fruit on them , and there is ice and snow on the ground outside , very little natural light this time of year.It seems flimsy , and you would n't want to kick it around or place it somewhere with lots of traffic and people bumping into it . Otherwise , I have n't a problem with the fact that it is n't SOLID . I move it around a little every day or two to make sure everything is getting some light . It handles that just fine.I 'm thinking of getting another one or two . If it was n't so expensive , I would . I have n't found anything I like better .	1
I live in the mountains of California and we have a very short `` summer '' season . I wanted to grow tomatoes , spinach and herbs indoors . This system is perfect ! First of all it was very easy to set up . There were no tools necessary except for a rubber hammer for just one connection that was a little tight . There is only one bulb which was a concern at first , but this 54 Watt/T5 bulb throws out an incredible amount of light . Much more than my old two-bulb/T12 ( fatter bulbs ) fixture . I did the math : This system costs a mere $ 5 a month to keep on for 12 hours a day . That 's in California which has one of the highest electricity costs at 15 cents a KW.I have this set up on a 6 foot by 2 1/2 foot table and the light shines across the whole table ! Printed on the crossbar is a note that this stand can hold up to 30 pounds . That means that I can attach a larger light fixture with two bulbs , or even my 4 bulb ( thin T5 's ) fixture and use it with a much larger table ( or two ) without any trouble . Nice to have options.Under the light I have a large `` grow box '' 29 '' wide and 15 '' deep . PLUS smaller 24 '' x 8 '' boxes for the herbs , spinach and bush beans . I have covered the whole table with planters and they all get plenty of light . The light goes easily on and off with a toggle , or you can use a timer . Being able to adjust the light up and down with ease is a great plus . I have some planters sitting on boxes to get the right height for them , as I will be adjusting the light for the benefit of the tomatoes.I found the perfect indoor tomato . It 's called `` extreme dwarf bush tomato '' . Seeds are available on line from many specialty seed companies . This tomato bush grows only about 18-24 inches tall and since this system is 32 1/2 '' tall , it 's perfect . This brings me to the best feature of this unit : it 's tall ! You can grow so many things under this light that you may not have thought of . Some indoor greenhouses only have only 12 inches between shelves to work with . Additionally , you could place this unit 's legs on bricks or boxes and raise it even further if you needed to.The high output T5 bulb is rated 6400K-Full Daylight Spectrum , and will last 20,000 hours . That 's 1,667 12-hour days , or over 4 1/2 years , and costs pennies a day to run . The fixture gets slightly warm , but not hot at all . This unit is sturdy , not flimsy at all , and will last a very long time . I 'm buying another one and getting ready for bare root strawberry planting time !	1
As you can see , most of these reviews are very old . I have one and it is very sturdy and designed quite well . The lifting mechanism works great and is a great improvement over most of the more inexpensive systems that require moving each side separately . I would definitely recommend this system - its a nice dark forest green and the paint job is excellent - you could put it in the living room and it would look just fine . I ca n't comment on shipping and packing as I bought mine at a retail store but I would have to say the package itself seems pretty well packed so if anything breaks I would say the retailer you bought it from did not protect it well enough in the shipping box . It is , afterall , a lightbulb and should be shipped as such , with plenty of pellets .	1
When I retired , I wanted to retire my home made pvc light stand . Mind you , there was nothing wrong with it . Having said that , these light systems by Hydrofarm are fantastic . I have four of them and used them all winter . Packaging and instructions were right on and they are absolutely wonderful . I wondered at the system for raising the light up and down because it seemed so simple . Well , simple and smooth it is . It raises and lowers the lights in micro inches if you want . In this way you can raise them as the plants grow and it seems not to wear out at all with one season behind them . I wish I had done this way before I retired .	1
I just set this up over the trays with my spring seed crops started . It was super easy to assemble . The parts just pop together and it goes up like a breeze . The instructions refer to chains for hanging the light but the hanging mechanism is not a chain but that is OK . Overall this solves trying to rig a light up over the trays and will come apart to store . Great product !	1
This was very easy to assemble , very sturdy . Everything was intact in the box . I used this all winter and I am going to have a bumper crop of veggies . Very pleased with this product . Easy to pack up and store away for the summer too . Highly recommend	1
The advantages of grow lights are obvious , so I wo n't summarize them here . I will mention that the sign on the produce advising that it is for use only in dry environments was surprising . Surely a product intended to be used in raising plants is by definition going to be used in a somewhat humid environment . That aside , it 's a good little unit , easy to assemble and fairly easy to disassemble later . I 'm not sorry to own one .	1
This this is the best . It was easy to install and setup and the guillotine nature of the suspended lights make it easy to adjust the light source as your plants grow . I had this system combined with the greenhouse kits and heat mats with thermostats and my starters came up extraordinarily quicker than any other method I have tried previously . I did notice it took a bit longer for it to ship , but it is an absolute charm . No more trying to grow plants in my kitchen window sill !	1
Unlike some other reviewers , I find the build quality satisfactory . It is a little small for potted plants , however . When raised to the highest position , the lamp has a 26 '' clearance to the ground . The high-efficiency bulb generates a little less heat than standard fluorescent lights but is still hot enough to scorch leaves that come too close . In short , the maximum height for the plants is around 24 '' , sufficient for a seed starter but way too low to serve as a mini-green house for plants that need to winter indoors .	1
This is a great system for lighting , and I have absolutely no complaints with that . I wish this unit had come with optional items one could buy along with it such as 'heating pad the length of the light . ' I tried to find one but they were all too short . With the right heating pad I would have had far better results - but again , no problem of the light . Strongly recommend it .	1
I am very impressed with this unit ! I was able to start most of my seeds indoors this year and the ability to raise and lower the light easily to make sure you do n't end up with spindly plants is great . The light does not put out massive amounts of heat at all and is *incredibly* bright ! What amazing technology . Highly recommend if you are a gardener who lives in an area with a short growing season . The unit is extremely portable and lightweight . It is also so simple to put together almost anyone could do it . I prefer putting it on a table for easier access to plants and I also bought an inexpensive timer so I would n't have to remember to turn the unit on and off while working . Great value .	1
I like to grow herbs indoors , and save a ton of money by starting flowers and veggies inside , 3 months before I can move 'em outdoors.I 've had the Hydrofarm Jump Start for a couple of weeks , and already have some pretty little green heads pushing up from the Jiffy peat pellets.Some have said that the metal bars were flimsy , but that 's not what I found . They 're more than adequate for the job , and fit together easily enough.It 's a bit confusing when the company talks about `` bulbs '' - plural - since there is only 1 fluorescent tube supplied , or that could fit in the highly reflective holder.This is an energy-efficient T5 fluorescent tube - one of the new , skinny kind . I 'm used to seeing the standard store type - the T12 's - which are big around as a silver dollar ( and are being phased out ) . This one would have a diameter more like a quarter . You can replace them easily enough at your local hardware/home supply store - I checked.This is just the 4-foot lighting system : I also ordered a company 's Germination Station , Heat Mat and Digital Thermostat ( sold separately ) .I 'd say this was a well thought out device , relatively simple , sturdy enough , and works well.Recommended !	1
This is very heavily built and well designed . For a compact grill it reaches cooking temperature rapidly , and can hold 6 large burgers easily . You can adjust the grill height to two positions . So far I 've found the high position cooks best for my own style of cooking . It 's is easy to clean ( set it on the grass and hose it out ) . The bottom grating is showing signs of rust , so I 've started using WD-40 on it after I rinse it out . However , it is so stout that I do n't know that the slight rust would cause a problem for some time .	1
Pros:1 ) Beautiful sear marks and flavour2 ) Preseasoned , so it 's easy care , just wipe down with an oily paper towel , and remember to cleanup the ash after use.3 ) Simple effective no-frills design.4 ) Can be used as an outdoor firepit.5 ) Sturdily built.6 ) The oval shape is much more space-efficient than the round one : a ) for finding somewhere to put it , b ) the cooking surface - you can fit 6 burger patties on this , flank steak , a full rack of ribs , good sized slab of salmon ... ( not all at once ! ) plus two or three medium potatoes wrapped in foil next to the coals . You can cook for 2-6 pple.c ) in arranging the coals for the right type of heat for what you want to cook.Cons:1 ) No lid -- For a lid , I would suggest the Cajun Classic brand cast-iron oval dutchoven flipped upside down.2 ) Matching oval-shaped Lodge cast-iron Dutch oven is discontinued ( could be used as lid , griddle and dutch oven ) .3 ) It is heavy4 ) It is ugly5 ) Design too basic ? Could be made more user friendly with height-adjust option during cooking . Currently , you have to flip the grill over to change height.You have to really know your coals . Not very charcoal-phob friendly.6 ) Limited use : a ) Cast Iron retains heat and cools slowly , so not very pratical for anything where you might have to move it before it cools.b ) Needs to be baby-ed : water + ash = lye , which will eat away at the cast iron bottom causing rust . So no open grilling in a snowstorm , during unstable weather , or leaving out overnight to cool . You have to go back out when it cools to put it under some sort of cover.Needful accessories:1 ) Oval dutch oven to be flipped upside down and used as a lid.2 ) Chimney starter.3 ) dutch oven lifter which can we used to lift the grill grate and adjust the height while grate is still hot.4 ) alternately a pair of heat resistant gloves.5 ) 2 pairs of heat resistant tongs , one for fiddling with the coals/ash and another for cooking with.6 ) The nylon cover to help protect it from weather ( better than nothing , but a garage or shed is best ) .Conclusion : Love it for its efficient size and shape , great sear marks and flavour . Hate it for when the sky threatens to snow/rain.Precaution for those who live on the shore : I live by the shore and have salt water mist roll in overnight . I MUST move it into the shed , as moisture/mist/condensation will collect even under the protective covering . Also , a well oiled and cleaned grate will rust in the salt mist if left out overnight .	1
I 'm no metal expert but there is a big difference between real cast iron and the pot metal a lot of these cheapie grills are made of . The Sportsman 's is the real thing , plus has the solid look and feel of quality . Not to mention a near perfect design , the large oval grill top gives plenty of surface area for even a backyard BBQ . It takes only a small amount of coal to fill the bottom , and temperature is controlled by the sliding air intake near the bottom . You can had more coal though the front door if it gets too low.I grilled 10 brats on it last summer and they came out perfect , of course I cheated a little because I precooked them in beer and punched them once with a fork . That allows your grill to brown them without constant attention , and so they do n't explode if it 's too hot , plus they cook up in 8 minutes not 20 on a moderate heated grill . I then switched to foil wrapped ears of corn , and finished the grill day off with a dozen shish kabobs with chicken , pineapple , sweet pepper , onions , and small heirloom tomatoes . Everything came out great , and having participated in my friends sacrificial offerings disguised as a BBQ , I know the difference between cooked and hopelessly burned.Not to mention if you have a big gas or charcoal grill this is a quick way to do a smaller scale BBQ for just yourself and immediate family without breaking out then having to clean the big grill . Best way to clean this , let it burn all the way down , take off the top grill , the door and the other small parts , dump the ashes ( cold ) into the trash , wipe with a damp cloth and your back in business total cleaning time 3-5 minutes . Was it ever easier to clean a backyard grill . FYI it 's iron do n't leave it outside in the rain or keep it wet it will rust ! Recommended , for all , but small children , or irresponsible pyromaniacs !	1
This thing is awesome ! Just big enough to cook for a small get together , but small enough to fire up for just two . I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them . A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours . Still learning different ways to cook with it , but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer . TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top , and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It 's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it , then after cook marshmallows . Food , Friends & Drink ! Life is good ... ...	1
After all , it IS cast iron . It should last a lifetime . It was very easy to put together , and we expect to use it for making kabobs on these warm summer days . I think it took all of about 4 minutes to put it together . There were no instructions and none were needed.We already have a charcoal grill , but sometimes you want just to cook enough for say two people and that 's it , with no left overs . This will do the job very nicely and not use a lot of charcoal.Oh , they recommend you place it on a concrete patio block to protect any surfaces underneath the grill . The legs will get pretty hot , and the concrete block will absorb most of that , and not allow for any charring to take place under the unit . You will need to have protective gloves on to handle the draft vents .	1
Great cast-iron grill . We have usually cooked on a typical Weber-type charcoal grill , and we still use that a lot . But this little grill has become our favorite for a quick , fun family grill time . We use a charcoal chimney to get the coals going ( half of what we use in the Weber ) and sometimes add food-grade wood chips to cook chicken , salmon , burgers , hot dogs , and steak . After grilling , I will remove the grate , add some wood , and we 'll roast marshmallow over a small fire . Clean up is typical for cast iron ( no soap , just hot water and light scrubbing ) . Just be sure to keep the entire grill ( not just the grate ) well-seaosned . To clean the outside , I use hot water , a soap-free scrub sponge , and then season the body of the grill while it is still warm ( so that the water evaporates and the seasoning can sink in ) . If you like cooking with cast iron , this is a GREAT grill to get . If you do not like cast iron , then this grill likely wo n't work for you .	1
We 've had a dozen of those cheap portable charcoal grills that either do n't cook worth a darn or fall apart after a single season . This one definitely wo n't be doing that . Very sturdy , good quality grill - quality we expect from Lodge . I have a feeling this is the last portable grill we 'll ever have to buy , and it 's a good thing because these are getting harder and harder to find.We BBQ throughout the year and this is perfect for the deck and porch . Mind you , if you 're looking to feed the family and guests in your backyard , you need a bigger grill , but if you 're camping or just grilling up a chicken , steak , or a couple burgers - this is absolutely perfect ! While the price of cast iron has sharply increased recently , if you take care of ( see below ) this grill , it will actually save you money over the years.NOTE : This is made out of cast iron . If you do n't know how to care for cast iron , you need to search the web for ( easy ) instructions on how to & # 34 ; season & # 34 ; cast iron . It takes time and anybody CAN do it , but if you 're lazy and wo n't WANT to put the ( little ) effort into it , please DO N'T buy this - you wo n't be happy . DO NOT throw it away if it shows signs of rusts - give it to lover of cast iron and they 'll put the effort into it to fix it up - and they 'll love you for the gift !	1
The Lodge Logic L410 Sportsman grill is wonderful . I received this as a Father 's Day gift and put it to work . 28 briquettes and cooked 4 1/3Lb burgers and 4 jumbo hotdogs to perfection . 1 '' thick steaks cooked perfectly . Easy to assemble and clean . Took a lightly oiled cloth to clean out any residual ash once it cooled . Stores nicely . I will mention it is heavy so be careful . It is cast iron and therefor weights a bit . Others have concerns about the tabs breaking off the door , but if you are moving it that much remove the door to move the grill .	1
One of my friends received this as a gift to use for tailgating parties . After a few uses , he decided it took to long to cool off , was to hard to clean and had put it back in the box with the intention of setting it out with the trash ! Fortunately before he did , he saw me looking at it on this website and asked if I planned on buying it . I said yes and he said do n't because he had one that he was going to throw away . If I did n't mind it being used and a little rusty , I could have his . I took it . It was rusted but I scrubbed it , oiled all the parts , and seasoned it in the oven ( it was still cold outside so I could n't fire it up ) ! This little grill came in so handy when we bought another house in the spring and removed the stove to make way for the new one . I cooked on it everyday . What my friend found as a disadvantage , I found as an advantage , it stays hot for a long time ! I grilled everything , half smokes , kabobs , burgers , chicken , veggies , fish , etc . . . and nothing stuck ! I also grilled ribs on it . I sliced them into individual ribs , placed them on the grill , and covered them with foil ( crimped the foil around the rack with tongs ) . They turned out really good . I used my little cast iron skillet on top of the rack to scramble eggs , and blacken steaks ( lots of coals needed for that ) .The grill is very durable and as long as it is properly taken care of will provide many years of grilling pleasure ! I really like it because the grill rack can be put in the sink for easy clean up and as long as it 's properly seasoned , I do n't have to worry about my food sticking to it.I also have a 22 '' weber kettle grill that I use when I want to grill a lot of food or large items . If I do n't , I set this one inside of it on the grate and use it instead . This is an excellent grill for a small household , and I recommend it over the other hibachi type grills . It 's great for camping but keep in mind that since it 's cast iron it takes a long time to cool down , so start grillin ' early !	1
I purchased this set in 2006 , but it came with a 3 batt charger and 3 batts . Since then it has undergone continuous use from the spring to fall . I have also added 3 more batts to get the jobs done in my yard ( total 6 batts ) . It is a convenient set to use.Hedger : Good at lasting a long time ( just used it for some large bushes a few weeks ago ) . No cord to keep track of makes this much easier to hedge with abandon . Decent power , as I can go through normal size hedge branches and leaves without too much problem . Also , no cord makes it easier to climb around my walls and just stretch my hand out to get to tall/far places.Blower : Goes through a batt fairly quickly . Pretty powerful since it only runs on batts . Easily clears off my sidewalk and driveway or loose leaves/grass/dirt . I probably use this tool the most.Trimmer : Is decent , but not terribly powerful . The replacement spools run about $ 14-16/3pk which adds up over time . However , I almost never use the trimmer now that I 've upgraded to the B/D 24v versionBlack & Decker NST1024 24-Volt Cordless String Trimmer/Edger , which is much more powerful and lasts longer on one batt . Trimmer is good for just grass and small weed growth . Do n't go tackling big grasses and weed bushes unless you are a patient person.After awhile the 18v batts lose their ability to hold juice , and so after a couple of years , you will to either replace the batts or deal with less and less capacity . Batts run ~ $ 30-40 . I think this set is ideal for those who live in townhouses , or have small yards , like 1/4 acre . It is VERY convenient to not have a cord trailing you . No cord to roll up when you 're done . No gas or oil changes to bother with either . After almost 5 years , everything still works fine ( though the batts are getting lame ) .	1
Got sick and tired of maintenance of my gas and corded lawn equipment , so I got rid of it and went electric ( and cordless ! ) Price ( $ 165 ) here is incredible based on what other places sell this kit for , so for the price I paid , 5 star easily.Pros : - so easy to start and use- 3 included batts ( and a charger than can charge all 3 at once ! ) ensures you have plenty of juice for small to medium yards-lightweight tools , easy to maneuver-costCons : - cheap plasticky feel ( I guess to keep them lightweight , everything 's a tradeoff ) - this is NOT for anything other than LIGHT yard work . If you live in an overgrown jungle , do not get this kit.- I wish the string trimmer had dual strings coming out , not one , and the reach was a little longerI have just started using these , so no thoughts on reliability , but I have used all three tools . Was most impressed by the hedge trimmer I think . They took on a huge 6 ft. out of control loropetalum I have w/o any problem at all . Wow ... impressed with the power there.String trimmer is kind of weak , but I expected that ... I mean it IS running on a BATTERY for pete 's sake ! I did wish it had SLIGHTLY more reach as well , as I had to get really close to some of the walls that my grass grows next to.Blower is best thought of as a carport/deck/garage blower and nothing more than that . It did great in my small carport and deck , but I would never try to use it for actual leaves ( I would never blow my leaves anyway , rakes are faster imo ) .Anyway , a reserved 5 star ... if we had half stars , I would give it a 4.5 for a great little kit at a fantastic price.Completely dependent on what kind and size of yard you have though .	1
After passing this up last year when it was a deal of the day , I was lucky enough to stumble across it again this year and told myself , do n't make the same mistake twice . I did n't , and I have no real reservations about the purchase at this point.The main reason I purchased these items were convenience . I was tired of hauling the electrical cord to the back yard so I could finish out the mowing . I 've never owned a blower or power hedge trimmer , so those were a bonus.Perhaps the best part of this package is that the edger has auto feed , meaning I do n't have to tap it on the ground to advance the spool . I absolutely love that.The blower works fine for what I use it on . We have a patio , driveway and a small section of sidewalk that we blow off maybe every weekend . While not exceedingly powerful at 120mph , it does do what I want it to do . However , for some of the really dirty areas on the patio , water is still needed ; which is what I was trying to avoid.The hedge trimmers are great and I can get through our 6 or so bushes without a problem.All in all , I think this is a great package of electric tools . They have enough juice to do the job I need them to , but I can also see where they may not be very good for larger projects , especially with the only 2 included batteries .	1
I bought this set in 2011 when moving to a new ( to us ) home with much more lawn , shrubs , and trees than I 've ever had . I also have the 18V lopper so in all 4 batteries that fit any of these tools.First of all the light weight of these tools really helps . Batteries last long enough for me to do what I need to do and I always have spares if I need them . Second there are no cords to deal with , no gas needs , no oil needs , no pull starting , and the batteries are quick and easy to install and remove.The real champ of these three tools is the edger . I 've used it now for about 15 months and have not had to replace the line yet ! I bought a spare pack of three line spools and it is still unopened . Second the line auto-feeds ; no tapping ! It has lots of power to edge our two lawns , and trim around trees after I 've mowed . It is quick and easy to rotate the head for edging or trimming . Sweet little tool.The hedge trimmer works great . We have lots of bushes and hedges that require a trim about twice a month . The best thing about this trimmer is how light it is.The weak link in the chain is the blower . It is just a little weak in terms of the stream of air it blasts . It starts out with a little more power but within a minute or so it slows down about 10 % then stays there for 5-10 minutes until it really starts to lose power as the battery drains . I still use it , have n't felt the need to go out and buy anything with more power , but I still wish it had a little more umph ! This is the reason for taking one star off.I would n't call the blower a `` leaf blower '' because it just does n't have enough power to do a good job on blowing leaves off a lawn . The blower works fine for sidewalks and other hard surfaces . I use it after mowing and trimming the lawn.We live in a tract home . Our front yard is about 30 ' x 60 ' and our rear lawn is about 30 ' x 90 ' . I do n't consider these lawns small by California standards . Due to these tools being cordless , and I also have a B & D ; battery operated lawn mower , I can mow , trim , and blow off the sidewalks , patio , and driveway all within 20 minutes . I was never able to do that with corded electric tools or gas engine tools.For a typical mow , trim , and blow operation I use three batteries . One in the mower , one in the edge trimmer , and one in the blower.I often think , while using these tools , that I should run in and put a comment on Amazon - so today I finally did ! ! !	1
I had purchased a grass hog like four or five years ago , and it worked well . But when the batteries started not holding a charge well , I figured it was time to get a gas trimmer . So I got one , a simple one that did n't need gas/oil mix , and immediately tore a hole in the siding at the bottom of my chimney the first time I used it . Had more power , but I really hated how it threw the grass everywhere , trashing my shoes and pants . So I went back to using the grass hog again , despite the batteries that did n't last.So I was about to purchase some batteries when I saw this deal pop up , and thought I 'd go this route instead . Was n't that much more than just two batteries would 've been , and I got a blower and a trimmer to boot . Granted , I have no need for the hedge trimmer , and already have a powerful black and decker corded blower , but the cordless would be useful in some situations.Arrived quickly , unboxed , and my first disappointment was that the battery charger ca n't be mounted . To me , for a unit designed to hang on the wall , that seems pretty stupid . Also , as others have noted , it now only comes with two batteries , as described in the product details , not three as it used to.Hanging the rack was a piece of cake . They use the types of drywall mounts I like , the large screw types that hold so securely , rather than the smaller ones that just have a little pop out in the back to keep them from pulling out . So this thing mounts VERY well even if you do n't get it in a stud . Three screws to hold the metal bar to the wall , then four screws each for the individual hooks for each unit.As I said , I do have a corded B & D ; blower , which works very well . I knew this would n't match up to that , but it actually was even less than I had thought it would be . I used it in my garage to blow out grass clippings and dust , and it worked fine for that , but anything else would 've been pushing it . Garage floor is smooth so things slid fine , but on my driveway , with the roughened surface of the concrete , it was n't enough wind to dislodge the grass pieces from the rough surface . This after being fully charged for about 16 hours . But for small jobs , I will enjoy the convenience it provides of not dealing with power cords.Trimmer I ca n't attest to since I have no bushes , but it ran fine , not too noisy , and seems like it should do a fine job on them.The grass hog is a little different than the older one I had , but still the same basic functionality , and works just as well as the one I 've been using for several years . Nice to have new batteries again.Other than the underpowered blower and the inability to mount the battery charger , it was a good deal with the gold box offer , but as many have stated in their reviews , it 's not for people with larger yards .	1
I sure do love having this set in my shed . I 've used the blower extensively and the weed-whacker extensively . I 've never used the hedge trimmer , so I ca n't comment on that.Some perks..* it comes with two rechargeable batteries , which is super handy for heavy work days . The battery charger also holds/chargers both batteries at the same time . Bonus . * Lightweight . I never felt worn out carrying any of these around the lawn . * A wall mount with hooks comes with the set . So , I was able to hang these all neatly in my shed , just like in the photo . * Durable , good B & D ; quality.The only bummer I 've found with this set is that the leaf blower sucks the life out of the rechargeable batteries rather quickly . So , do n't dawdle when using the leaf blower .	1
I like these tools . They 're plastic and run on batteries , but they work . Not as powerful as your gardener 's gas powered machines , but for the homeowner who does n't plan on any heavy duty shrubbery cleaning , these will do the trick nicely .	1
I bought these shortly after buying Black & Decker 's cordless electric lawn mower ( which I also love ) , and I was n't disappointed.The trimmer/hedge trimmer/blower work as you 'd expect , the trimmer even features a telescoping body to adjust comfortably to your height . They are also relatively quiet and require no gasoline can or earplugs ! The best part is that you get all three units for the price of just two of them sold separately ! Plus , an unexpected but very welcome bonus is that this set comes with its own plastic mount for all three tools AND a separate mount for the batteries . I would n't have considered this a big selling point , had I read it , but having the ability to easily hang the tools in my garage out of the way and out of the reach of my kids is more valuable than I expected.Bravo Black & Decker ! -1 star , however , because my package came with only two batteries ( though to B & D ; 's credit , they sent the third with minimal fuss once I contacted customer support ) .Oh , and once you buy these suckers , beware ! Black & Decker have a whole product line of cordless drills , saws , sanders and other power tools that run on the 18-volt battery system , and once they pull you into the product line , all the other 18-volt products become pretty enticing !	1
The easiest way to go. , March 10 , 2008By P. Stein `` Bengals Fan '' ( Beavercreek , OH ) - See all my reviewsI previously purchased all three items separately . The broom works great on my outdoor carpet , and is much easier to use than a wet dry vac . Easily blows away lawn clippings . The hedge saw is much easier to use than my electric hedge saw , though not as powerful . Fair tradeoff . The trimmer works fine . Preferable to either gas or electric , though obviously less powerful . Again , a fair tradeoff . If you have to stop and recharge it , no big deal . I received a promotional radio/charger free . I just keep the battery in the radio charger , and it 's always ready to use . Great for when you use a portable radio all day . Recommend you try to add the radio to your arsenal . I 'm glad I purchased these items . It made my life easier .	1
I had purchased a different yard combo about 2 month before and they where a piece af junk . All the stuff ran for about 1 minute and then started running out of power . The hedgers broke and I couldnt get them replaced.I wanted a set of these yard tools so I bought the Black and Decker set . Yes the set was about 80.00 more and had less voltage but I was deturmined to get a cordless yard set . When I received them the first thing I noticed was the construction was a lot better . I charges them up over night and used the handy storage rack . In the morning I got out the hedgers and trimmed up all my hedges on 1 battery then used the same battery and used the trimmer and then the blower all on the same battery . WOW The trimmers had more power then I expected , same with the blower . I am very pleased with this set . I recommend this set to anyone who is in the market for a cordless yard combo .	1
First of all , this is a light duty set of tools . If you 've got a large lawn and garden to take care of , I think you 'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools . But I 've found this perfect for my needs . Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so , and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area . The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery . The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models , but it 's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces .	1
My 11-year-old son will be helping me do the lawn work this summer . To prepare him for this task , I bought this electric lawncare set so he would n't have the frustration of trying to start a balky gas edger/trimmer.The edger/trimmer works okay , but it has only one spool opening instead of the two opening like on my gas edger/trimmer . The unit does n't have much power to cut through very high weeds/grass or to sever the thick St. Augustine grass we have here in Florida . But , with enough patience , it will eventually cut the thick grass shoots and does a good enough job with cutting just grass blades . It 's lightweight enough my son can use it without a problem.The blower is nice to have . It does n't have the power of a gas-powered blower , of course , but it has enough power to clear debris off the sidewalk or driveway . Again , what you give up on in power you gain in convenience of having an electric-powered device.The hedge trimmer was a joy to use . I ca n't believe I used my electric hedge trimmer for so long . It 's wonderful to be untethered to an electric extension cord ! The B & D ; hedge trimmer cut effortless through my mature ficus hedge and it weighed no more than the corded hedge trimmer it replaced.Battery life is , generally , not real good . I 'd say that you can expect to get maybe 5 to 10 minutes of continuous use ( such as when you 're using the blower ) , or maybe 10 to 15 minutes of actual running time with intermittent breaks ( such as when you 're trimming ) . On our 100x75 lot , one battery is needed to do all the lawn trimming , one battery is needed to do all the blowing , and one battery was sufficient to manicure the 6 ' hedge that runs about 30 feet on my front yard.In sum , I 'm glad I got this set . Having no cords or gas spills or troubles during start-up make it a pleasure to use . I wish they had more power and long-lasting batteries , but I do n't regret this purchase at all .	1
I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues . I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners . And boy , are they great ! She had these pruners for a number of years , and they are still sharp and cut like new ! I have n't had to sharpen them . They feel comfortable in my small hand . They operate very smoothly , they lock very smoothly , much nicer compared to the others pruners I 've used . And they work ! I can cut through some thick branches with ease , despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair ( even though I doubt this one will break ) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner .	1
I treated myself to a new pair of these a few years ago ... good investment ! There is simply no substitution for quality . I have been using the Felco pruner for years ; more years than I can remember and these tools are the best of the best . Yes , you pay more for them but it is well worth the extra cost.There are a few things to remember about these wonderful tools : First , they are a bit prone to rust . Most good pruning tools have this in common as it is the steel that they are made from that does it . I have found that simply wiping them off with a paper towel and then wiping them down with an oily rag after use will pretty well take care of the problem . It is interesting to note that I bought a pair of these pruners a few years ago at an auction . They were ancient and completely covered with rust . I paid .25 cents for them . A bit of rust remover , oil and elbow grease along with a good sharpening had them working like new in no time . I still use them.Secondly , these pruners are easy to take apart and it is very easy to replace any part . This is particularly handy when it comes to the blade . To keep these instruments in top working order they need to be kept sharp . The scissors action is far superior to the anvil type in both easy of cutting and less damage to the plant . They must be kept shape though . Fortunately this is not difficult but it is the nature of any blade that eventually you will not be able to sharpen it and it will have to be replaced . This is a snap.Thirdly , I have noted from working with others and talking to others that the major reason for dissatisfaction with this tool or any such pruner is that it will not `` cut . '' Upon examination I have found that the reason for this not cutting is almost invariably the fact that people ask the pruner to do more than it was built to do ... i.e . trying to cut limbs that are too large . This is NOT a lopper . This is not a cross cut or a chain saw ! It has its limitations ! Use the proper tool for the job and there is seldom a problem.Fourth , the model being reviewed here could indeed , as pointed out by several reviewers , be too large for smaller hands . I suggest a smaller model . They cut as well and fit the hand better . They simply can not cut as large a limb or twig as this one does.Fifth , you can indeed buy pruners for as little as five bucks ... you can buy dozens and dozens of them over the years ; and trust me , if you use them a lot , you will be buying replacements constantly . Overall , it is far more economical to go ahead and buy the best , as represented here , and have something that if taken care of , will last far longer than you will.This is a good tool and if it is taken care of and not abused , it will last you a lifetime.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
I have n't owned these long enough to know how they will stand the test of time , but they seem very well made , have a sharp blade , are comfortable , and have smooth action . I like that you can swap out the blade after you 've sharpened it too many times . Mine came with a tiny tool that can be used to take apart the pruners , replace the blade , etc . Seems like something that will be lost instantly . Would have appreciated it if they had designed this to store on the pruner body somehow . Also , the aluminum is roughed up a bit towards the tip of the pruner . I am assuming this is part of manufacturing process but it looks more like someone drug it on the concrete or something . The rest of the tool is finished nicely .	1
The most used garden tool is the pruners . Cutting your plants back , you should make a clean cut as to not stunt their growth . Again as things like small branches and trees grow you have to prune them back so this tool works great . I work HVAC and always have a branch up my butt and love these to cut back plants around the condenser . Buy it you 'll love them . As what people said about rust , these are make of steel and they do get a little rust but nothing big . Stainless is a soft metal and would not work .	1
This pruner is so easy to use . It comes with a wrench and instructions on how to replace the blade . The cutting action is very smooth and the price I paid for this pruner was well worth it .	1
My mom owns a garden design and maintenance business . I never really took interest in it until my wife and I purchased our first home . As expected , we are now avid gardeners and landscapers.I really like Fiskars and had a set of them along with a cheap set from Target on hand . My mom recommended that we step up to Felco Pruners . She noted how she 's had her set for over a decade and either takes them in for sharpening or orders new blades . They are built for life.I keep mine in my house with my nice knives.The motion is fluid and exact . The cut is fine and thorough . The ergonomics are spot-on . I can not find a weak point or complaint . Be sure to buy the leather belt holster as well.Felco is a Swiss company that specializes in one thing for over 60 years - cutting tools.I wish I bought these sooner .	1
Works well and make each job so much easier . Would recommend . Handle is comfortable which is so important during cutting .	1
I purchased this product because I have a well and did not want to contaminate my drinking water , yet , I needed some type of insect intervention . After some flubs trying to apply it properly , I found it to be highly effective , yet non-toxic ( so far ! ) .The thing you will need to be aware of is that this stuff has the consistency of flour . It is very `` fluffy '' and coats things ( this is how it kills insects ) . Orginally , my plan was to mix it with water and spray it . Unfortuntely , I purchased a stand alone sprayer which you prime manually to pressurize . Despite mixing this in the suggested 1 cup per gallon ratio ( which I read about online ) , the stuff instantly gunked my sprayer and spoiled my visions of prancing around like Bill Murray in Ghost Busters ( only for bugs ) .I ended up just using my hand and sprinkling it around my foundation outside . It was sort fo a messy and time consuming job , but I am already seeing good results . I have not had a single carpenter ant in my house since I did this , which is great.This product is costly . It is the food grade quality that makes it more expensive I believe . Please be aware that there are other versions of DE that may be cheaper , but be careful . Some , particularly Pool grade , is carcinogenic to humans and will not kill bugs . There is another type sold labeled as a garden product , but that contains added chemicals and bug attractants , which I was unsure about having possibly enter my ground water .	1
This is a high quality food grade DE and is labeled as such . Believe it is the finest powder I have ever purchased and is rated the purest I have found . My wife and I use it internally , plus I use it on the yard , under my home , garden and my large dog pens . It works well in my Dustin Miser ( sold on Amazon ) , producing a very fine cloud of DE dust . Because it is a very fine powder it coats things well and kills ticks , fleas , Colorado potato bug larva , most ants , and even most hard shell pests . People do n't think DE will kill hard shell pests but even they have connecting membranes between the hard shell parts , and legs that can be damaged or cut . This product was shipped FAST and I highly recommend it and this seller to anyone .	1
I could not find food-grade diatomaceous earth anywhere locally . Most places had no idea what I was even talking about . I have a relative who lives in a low-income building that has repeatedly been infested with bed bugs . Although they have had professional pest control in several times , they always seem to survive . Tenants are forbidden to use any poisons due to their many tenants with health problems . This diatomaceous earth seems to have solved his problem in his apartment and he 's now sharing the secret with his neighbors ! This product was a good price ; several dollars cheaper than similar products . Shipping was also more reasonable than others . And service was fast-it arrived in little over a week . I will buy from this seller again , should the need arise .	1
We drink it and use it to control household 'bugs ' . Helps with aches & pains as well as hair and nail health . I discovered this after using DE for years to control insects in the house .	1
I like the spikes . It makes keeping my plants in good shape so much easier than mixing a fluid mix . Just pop it in and you 're good to go !	1
wow ! I just may have green thumb , brought jobes and I 'm already seeing improvements ! ! ! ! especially with potho 's , will continue to use every 60 days ! ! ! ! hope they continue to grow all 26 of them ! ! !	1
My wife and I have been using Jobe 's houseplant food spikes for more years than I can remember ; of course we have been raising houseplant for more years than I can remember too so I suppose that works out well.I can honestly say that over these many years that we have never once been dissatisfied with this product and much prefer it to the various liquids we have used from time to time . Now we have lost house plants ; make no mistake about that , but it has never been due to this product . Normally I am the culprit in that I tend to overwater our plants and overwatering is the number one cause of houseplant loss . You would think I would learn ... .These are easy to use and easy to monitor . Depending upon the size to the pot being used , we adjust the number of spikes used . The spikes are always placed as far from the roots as possible and buried to their full length . Yes , the finally disappear in about two months . Now you do not want to over do it as any plant food can burn the roots if over used but I will say that it is more difficult to do that dastardly deed with these spikes than many other form of food we have used . They are easy to use , store well and we have had no problem finding them ( to purchase ) in the different area of the country we have lived.As to the amount used , the frequency used and matters such as they , it is best to do a bit of research on each plant you own . Plants , like people , are different and they all have specific needs . You can pretty well figure out what your plant needs via research and pure observation.It should also be noted that if you take advantage of the super saver offer here that the price Amazon is asking is more than reasonable ... actually it is about half of what we pay her locally.This is a good product and we have been extremely happy with it all these years.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
My biggest challenge will be not losing these in the back of a drawer somewhere before I use them all up .	1
Plant spikes have been around for just about as long as house plants have . They are one of the oldest ways of fertilizing potted plants as there is going . ( Someone with roots in their blood once told me that solid fertilizer preceded the liquid variety by quite a respectable amount of time . The liquid variety being easier , but not necessarily better ) . A lot of folks do n't seem to use them anymore since liquid fertilizers mixed with your regular watering are so much easier . My own experience with both is that the solid , slow dissolving spikes last longer , feed the plant the nutrients more efficiently over the longer amount of time , and genuinely do a better job of giving your plants the extra boost of good stuff all house plants can use . I am not a horticulturist and certainly do not claim to know this is a fact over a reasonable theory . What I do know is I have some of the biggest , healthiest house plants I have witnessed among my many peers that dabble in the home spun gardening trade as well . I stopped using liquid fertilizers years ago and have had excellent results with these spikes . You thumb them down just under the surface every couple of months and watch your house plants love you for it . I highly recommend the Jobe fertilizer spikes , and , I also recommend that if you ca n't or do n't care to locate them locally , that you buy them in bulk here on Amazon and make the shipping worth it . Made them part of a bundle package with something else and they ship for free at the time of this writing . Try them for just one or two of your plants and see if they do n't make you smile ...	1
My gardening over the past 20+ years is strictly self-taught . What I do know is that for years I have used Jobe & # 8217 ; s spikes when initially planting anything , whether in the ground or in pots , as an aid to help them thrive , and they do . For potted plants , I usually put a couple more in every year . For me this is an easy as well as effective way to fertilize . At the current $ 1.97 for 50 spikes , they are very competitively priced .	1
bought this to replace an older burner that died.. this thing packs some heat . the legs are sturdy the hose is plenty long	1
Fired this burner up this weekend and it seemed to run great . Flame is control is acceptible and you can turn it down low if you need to . I recommend running it hot before putting a pot on to burn the paint off in the flame path . The paint burning left some marks on the bottom of my pot which were hard to get off but its not a big deal .	1
I 've been using these for years and need another one . I saw this on Amazon and scooped it up right away . Killer price with free shipping . Check the prices on this at your local stores and you 'll see what I mean . This high pressure cooker is what I use to cook big pots of food outside . Like steaming crabs , gumbo , soups , stews , deep frying - - you name it . It 's made strong , for heavy pots .	1
I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months ( it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife does n't like the smell either ) . I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this . After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water ... I was ready to go . As others have mentioned , the paint does burn off many places during its first use . I did n't buy this to look pretty ... I want it to brew beer ... and fast . And fast brewing it certainly does . After using it a few times , I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high . Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner . Overall though , I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove ( I do partial mashes only ) . Good investment for any home brewer ... and it can double as burner for frying turkeys !	1
[ Update June 11 , 2012 : I 'm still using the Bayou cooker several times a week ] I bought this for two reasons:1 ) If it 's hot out , I 'd rather not heat up the house.2 ) I ca n't stand frying indoors . I do n't like the odors and I do n't want oil/grease in the house . We do n't have a big outdoor vented hood in the kitchen . Now I 'm able to fry outdoors much of the year.It 's a very simple unit.It 's light-weight and very portable . The propane tank weighs far more that the cooker.I use the cooker for wok cooking . Although I have a very good gas kitchen stove , none of the burners give off nearly as much heat as this Bayou cooker . At full blast , the Bayou cooker makes a whooshing sound like the gas units used in Chinese restaurants.The reason why I rated it 5 stars is price per performance . I 'm not comparing this unit to more expensive units .	1
This is a very useful outdoor gas cooker . Very rugged and well made . I use it a lot and have been great so far . Good price too .	1
I bought a stove top smoker a few years ago and although I do not use it everyday , I do tend to use it quite often . The problem is that I can not find the fine wood chips at the regular stores like Wal-mart or Target . These store usually have the really large chips or blocks but not the fine dust like chips one needs for this type of smoker . I have looked at other online stores and found the chips but they were more expensive than at Amazon . What I also like is that this particular pack of chips has an assortment for using with various different meats such as for smoking fish , pork chops , etc . Also , since the smoker I have is a Cameron brand , this is perfect . I especially like the alder for Salmon .	1
The small shaved size of these wood chips are perfect for a stove top smoker or any light smoking job . The chips smoked nicely with no off or greasy oily residue . I really loved the Cherry but all four were great . I smoked cheese , garlic , and salmon and the taste was fabulous .	1
These chips are exactly as described , and work perfectly . No complaints , no confusion , no aggravation . Is n't it great when a description fits perfectly ?	1
stovetop smoking : even the Li'l Smokey can do half a bird or a steak and give you that surprise smokey experience .	1
These work great in my stove top smoker and are cheap enough where you can try several types of wood out to see what impact they have on flavor .	1
The hose is good quality , and it appears to not be kink-able . The all-important connectors are very good quality , and appear to be well connected .	1
I like this hose . It is a dedicated hose for flushing my black tank . Works very well and seems to be a good build , good quality , good price , and works great . Will update PRN .	1
I wish I 'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25 ' is n't long enough ! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that . So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away . It 's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible , then again it 's brand new , and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple , once , too . I can see ordering a second 25 ' length , since 25 ' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard .	1
This is a sturdy hose , with thick tubing walls and solid brass fittings . It can kink under certain motions but not esaily -- call it kink resistant but not never-kink . My previous hose burst at a kink point , but this one seems much thicker and reinforced , and less likely to give way in that manner . I like using it just fine .	1
Just as i hoped - this is a fantastic buy - did not leak and is working well so far . Just get it . Small reminder that 25 feet is a small length .	1
I used this over the summer and it never tangled . It is a lot heavier than my other cheap hoses . I will be buying more of these .	1
My husband really likes this because , he said it covers a good amount of the lawn and he does n't have to move it so often . It adjusts easily , its sturdy and our grandkids had fun cooling off on those hot days too !	1
There were forest fires around us last summer and I had a couple of these around . I set them up to water out in the fields around us . They worked so well that I bought 6 more just for this purpose . As I am driving around my area ; I see that I am not the only one who uses them . They are sturdy , do n't leak for the most part and the sprinkler head is of decent quality . Unlike some other tripods , the sprinkler can be replaced with another if needed . They will fall over if you have a decent windy day . So , you should check on them occasionally .	1
Forget those spikes that bend or break when you shove them into hard ground this is the ticket and even if the sprinkler head should fail its easy to take off and replace . How do I know that you ask ? ? I was getting water from a lake and the intake hose sucked mud so I had to clean and replace the sprinkler . But all in all love the stand	1
Great product . I have at least ten of these . I wish I could buy the tripod without the brass sprinkler head . I replace those with Naan quiet heads . I hope Orbit maintains the quality . The two I bought yesterday seem to have cheaper connector .	1
I had used rockwool , but after reading some reviews thought I 'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool . Rockwool can easily get drenched , but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake . Even the spongy feel made me think & # 34 ; This must be delicious & # 34 ; . I never caved into that temptation , but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies . I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the & # 34 ; Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat , & # 34 ; which is convenient .	1
i wish the hole was a little smaller for my more delicate clones but for the thicker root plants it works great !	1
These fit plastic trays available at WalMart and Home Depot . Easy to water and can plant entire plug without damage to seedling roots .	1
I 'VE USED THESE EXCLUSIVELY FOR STARTING SEEDS . SO FAR , I HAVE AN ALMOST 100 % SUCCESS RATE ( I 'VE KILLED SOME SEEDLINGS ON REPLANTING , THOUGH ) . VERY CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE .	1
I bought these after much research about cloning . It seems that these come the most recommended from experienced growers . In a humidity dome my clones took root after about 7 days with a 100 % success rate . I have also started some bell pepper seeds with rapid success . Would highly recommend to anyone .	1
Man these are great I mean great never had roots to shoot out and so bog in such a short time less then 8 days from cuttings to rooted plants going to transplant them all into larger pots today I 'll never not use these again great things they are	1
as described , came quick , no issues	1
I received the Grodan rockwool 1.5 inch cubes with 45 cubes in the package . Following their directions , the cubes have worked well in starting my chard seeds for my hydroponics garden . Though I have n't seen anyone else mention this , I noticed that once the chard plants were full-sized and had well-established roots directly in the hydroponics solution , the chard appeared to prefer my leaving the rockwood cubes dry so they could stand up better .	1
These rockwool cubes are a good way to start cuttings . Light , sterile , easy to handle and affordable . They do the trick .	1
I compared this to to peat pellets for rooting a camilea from cuttings . These had a higher success rate than the peat pellets .	1
Been using rockwool cubes for cuttings for a long time now . Have always had good luck them them . I normally start seeing roots after about a week for most of my cuttings .	1
These work very well , I think . My seedlings came up just fine and without any issues . A recommended buy . Thank you .	1
I 've always wanted a smoker , but was n't willing to spend the money on a top of the line model . Plus , being a bit of a lazy cook , I wanted to get something that did n't involve a lot of fuss and muss.So , when I saw this Brinkman electric smoker , I thought I 'd give it a shot . While Amazon is my usual place to shop , I have to confess I got this from the big box home improvement store ( `` depot '' ) . They had it on the web site for less than half the Amazon price with free shipping . Plus had a coupon that took several more dollars off the price . Could n't pass it up . Granted , the one I got did not include the cover , but that 's not a problem since it will get stored in a sheltered area.The construction quality is not what you would call top-notch , but acceptable for the price . Assembly is straightforward - need a screwdriver and pliers . You will also need to season the smoker before using it for real . Simple process - just coat the inside with vegetable oil and then run it for 3 or so hours.Easy to use and the food is wonderful . I mean wonderful ! ! And so easy - basically just fill the pan with water , put in some wood chunks , put on the food and leave it alone for a few hours . That 's the type of cooking I like ! Clean up is a bit more involved since you have to clean the water pan and the grates . But both fit into the dishwasher , so I only have to wait for things to cool then toss them in for cleaning.I 'm sure the smoking purists will scoff at the idea of an electric model , and the more expensive ones will probably last longer and work better . I 'm also sure that this does not have the power to work well in very cold temperatures . But for summertime smoking , you ca n't get better than this for the money ( assuming you get it at the depot ) . Highly recommend ! Note : I was also very impressed by the customer service from Brinkman . The water pan had a big dent in it from shipping ( the depot shipped it in just the manufacturer box , and it must of taken a hit from UPS ) . The dent was deep enough that it cracked the metal , and I was concerned about long-term leaks and rust . I called Brinkman and five days later , a new water pan arrived via FedEx . No hassles , no forms , just quick , polite , effective service . Rare to find that these days .	1
I have had mine for 3 years now and love it . The assembly is minimal and the seasoning prcedure makes all the parts stay in great shape . I do a fair amount of smoking of meats ( weekly ) and it has been performing well . I have not modified it and manage the internal heat by using the right amount of charcoal and monitoring the unit every 20-30 minutes . Having worked with experienced Pit Masters , they all say the same thing . You have to pay attention to your fire , lift the lid as little as possible , monitor the temp , add more as needed . The only downside , true for all the water-smokers ( hence 4 instead of 5 ) is adding can be challenging but not impossible . Patience is required . Would I buy it again , yes . Most of my smoking is done between 200-225F , and it does from ribs and whole turkeys very well . Even smoked a meatloaf ! MMMMMMMMMM	1
I chose this smoker mainly because I found it on sale at one of the home improvement warehouses for only $ 69.00 ! . I chose electric because I like the idea that the temp remains constant . The downside is that the temp is not adjustable . On a cool day the temp seems to hover at 225 F which is nice for longer smokes . The documentation says it should be smoking between 250F - 275F . I do n't think it can get that high because of some minor issues in its shape.The smoker has no intentional venting . However , the drum of my unit is not perfectly round ; it is oblong . This causes two gaps about 12 '' in length and about 1/4 '' wide at its widest point . At first I was concerned with this , but after tasting a brisket and 2 chickens I have smoked , I like the results.I have yet to try the unit on a hot day so it will be interesting to see what the temperature rises to . I also wish the unit was built with a thermometer to read the temp.If you can find one of these for cheap , grab it . This is a great intro unit to smoking . I hope I get 3-5 years out of it and then I will upgrade to an insulated unit ( if I am still smoking.BTW , this can double as a small grill.UPDATE : Okay , 6 years later I am on my second Brinkmann . About 2 years ago the heating coil broke and I had to replace the whole smoker . I actually go a deal at one of the home improvement store by taking their floor model that was missing the water basin . Got the replacement unit for $ 49 . I have been smoking now for 6 years and I love it . Here is what I have found out about this unit over the last 6 years:1 . Temperature remains pretty constant . The key is the water basin . On a long smoke , when I do a 10- 14 lb brisket . I usually have to refill the water basin . This can be tricky because the basin sits under your meats . Try to position your meats so that there is room to add water , or use a funnel and open the side door . Always add hot water when you fill the basin . Adding cold water causes the temp to drop in the unit ( the basin is absorbing the heat ) 2 . There is not enough room to do ribs laying flat unless you cut off the tip.3 . I have trouble getting briskets up to the optimal temp 185-190 unless I wrap it and put it in the oven at the end.I still think this is a great entry level smoker and while I am now looking to move up to something else ( probably a green egg ) , I love this little guy . The consistency in temp and the inexpensive price make this a great smoker to learn the basics on .	1
This is a great hatchet that Paul would have liked to have had in his wood choppers tool box . There was a heavy storm in these parts fairly recently with very strong winds that knocked down many trees . Two of my neighbors trees fell into my yard and tore up my cedar fence . I also had my largest hardwood tree get blown over in my backyard where it fell without causing any damage . I sure wish Paul was available to help me out . Instead of Paul , this Fiskars hatchet came to the rescue in helping to clear up this big mess . Yes , I had to use a chainsaw as well when it came to cutting up the tree trunks . But the hatchet made short work of chopping up a lot of the branches . The hatchet has a nice heft and a comfortable grip . The blade stayed sharp far longer than I had anticipated . This is a must have tool to keep at hand . A great tool and a great price ...	1
Perfect little hatchet for small needs , excellent construction and the wife just luvs it , and if she luvs it , then I luv it , for nothing better than coming home to a fire in the wood-stove : )	1
I have really come to love the Fiskars tools . I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else , and this hatchet is the same way . It is different than others in many ways . It looks different and honestly a bit fragile . However it is one tough mother . The lightweight handle gives you more head speed , which translates into deeper cuts per chop . The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood . The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper . I am buying one of the axes in this line too . Awesome tool .	1
The blade is sharp and the construction is solid . It is small light enough to take on trips yet still able to cut through wood quickly . I would recommend this to anyone with a need for a hatchet .	1
I purchased theFiskars 7884 X27 36-Inch Super Splitting Axe , and was very impressed with it , so I thought I would give the hatchet a try . It is great , the blade is heavier than other blades , which helps build up the momentum and splits the wood nicely . I like the plastic handle because it feels a little more durable than a wood handle .	1
I give this product 4 stars because I really don & # 8217 ; t use it much . I do recommend this product and especially this manufacturer if you are looking for this kind of tool . It & # 8217 ; s well made , lightweight and holds a good edge and of course , it chops wood well ...	1
I bought this because I was so please with my other Fiskars ax . It certainly lived up to my expectations . Solidly build with an unbreakable handle and holds a great edge .	1
This little hatchet has a well balanced feel when swinging and is great for chopping kindling and small firewood . Looks well made and would recommend it	1
The hatchet is just the right size and comes with a safety cover which was a nice surprise . It has a good grip and feel . Like all fiskars products I feel confident in using it due to their lifetime warranty . I would definitely buy/ recommend this hatchet .	1
great quality and balance . I 'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works .	1
I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger pruners , then moved to gardening Fiskars etc . Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house & my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe , then he had to cut some & # 34 ; splinters & # 34 ; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight , extremely sharp , easy to maneuver , and once again , Fiskars , still made in Sweden ( maybe Finland ) produces far superior results.Top quality , lifetime guarantee , great addition.Ca n't find a fault , including a very fair price .	1
This stays sharp and never lets me down . It is light weight and the head is very secure ... it wo n't work loose over time like some wood-handled hatchets .	1
I like virtually everything Fiskars makes , and this little axe is no exception . Kept sharp , it cuts any wood briskly and evenly .	1
You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product , and no , I do not work for the company . Wish I did . All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful . I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally . The handle , the look , the design , the price . This is a top of the line product . Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money . Ohhh , Just had a thought ... .I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well . The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk . It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed , but I did not return it to the vendor , too much hassle . The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them .	1
well what can I say about kneeling mats other than I really like it . Right size and glad I was able to find this color . I use it all the time and it looks like it will last me a long time . Others I 've bought before only lasted a year before falling apart . So far so good .	1
Yes , it 's just a piece of foam with a hole in it , but it 's light , it 's tough , and it makes working on your knees much easier . I suppose you could recycle an old foam camping mattress into several kneepads , , but if you do n't already have one to recycle , this works just fine .	1
I at first was disappointed with the item when I pulled it out of the box as it is VERY light . But do n't let that fool you : this trowel is very strong and perfect for loosing up weeds ( in between flagstone or in gravel ) , mild digging ( 2-4 & # 34 ; rocks ) and full potting . I am going to buy another for my Grandma as this item is so light it will be perfect for her . I imagine it can not handle excessive force , but given it 's weight it is pound-for-pound as strong if not stronger than a metal or other material counterpart . PLUS it ca n't rust , which is great for me since I live near the ocean .	1
For some reason this was going for a very low price - I bought it because of that and only afterwards learned how nice a lightweight trowel it so have !	1
Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item . You simply can not beat that price . I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard . It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me . Do n't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine . But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $ 1 .	1
This is a pretty cheap and lightweight trowel . It is made from heavy duty plastic . The tip chips a bit when used with rocks , but is perfectly fine for everyday use . It seems nice and strong . The handle does not bend .	1
I bought two trowels from Amazon , one with a really big scoop and this one . I use this for my smaller plantings . It is well made and that is true with Fiskars . You can count on that manufacturer to sell a good product . It is small and that is what I was looking to buy .	1
One day I could n't find my old garden trowel ( a neighbor had borrowed it for concrete ! ) so I ordered this one . What a difference the lightness alone makes ! A GREAT product .	1
I needed a trowel that was non metallic for digging in dirt when treasure hunting . As long as you 're not digging in extremely hard dirt , this works just fine . I do n't use it for anything other than this so ca n't comment for gardening use but I 'd say it probably would work just fine .	1
What do i like about this , it 's great for light work . Like planting small seeds where you sprinkle them and I also like it that it wont rust . I would n't even think about chopping stuff with this , but it is a good tool in the gardners box . But the price verys so much I got this for a one buck as an add on item . Do n't pay to much for this .	1
While not as strong as a trowel made of metal , Fiskars 7978 Composite Trowel is still strong enough to handle basic gardening tasks . Made out of a composite plastic called ` FiberComp ' , the tool is very lightweight . The blade is oversized , quite wide , and appears to be quite sturdy . The rock solid handle is probably the strongest part of the tool , and snapping the blade off would take a great deal of force . The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb , and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode , and if not abused , it should last for a long while . The price at Amazon is a little steep , so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal .	1
Occaisionally this drop to less than $ 1 . I ordered a couple as it was so cheap . I use it a bit in the garden but it is also great for kids to use in the sand or dirt .	1
It feels light in my hand and this composite material is so strong , I 've never had a problem with any of these tools . Since it is so light it seems like there is less stress on my forearm/wrist as opposed to the heavier metal one I was using before .	1
I wanted a non metallic tool when treasure hunting with my metal detector . This wo n't set off my pinpointer and perfect for loose dirt and/or getting debris out of the way on the ground . It 's light weight so easy to carrry . I 'd use it for gardening around the home but for me flowers are nothing more than something to aim for with my mower ... so really not used for the `` proper '' purposes !	1
excellent tools as are all the Fiskar tools I 've purchased ... . for non-metallic tools , they are very nice and strong , non-magnetic tools ... ...	1
Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal , but it 's stronger than you might expect , and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening . Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called ` FiberComp ' , tool is very lightweight . The handle is rock solid , and while much thinner , the tines are surprisingly hard as well . While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft , it is capable of more rugged performance . The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb , and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode , and if used properly and not abused , it should last for some time . The price at Amazon is a little steep , so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal .	1
Earlier this fall , after a very expensive service call from a plumber , I found out that some creature chewed through the rubber tubes of my forced air heating system ( plumber left me a chewed tube as evidence ) . I recall seeing some dropping in the basement , they did not look like mouse dropping ( tubes rather than balls ) , so I got both a mouse trap and rat/chipmunk trapBig Snap-E Rat Trapas I do n't want to have another service call.I am attaching a photo of both next to each other for size reference ( I was wondering about this before buying both ) . This weekend I set them both up , and they were fairly easy to set up . The instructions did not mention what to use as bait , so it took me some research to find what works best . It appears that many people find that peanut butter works best because it is sticky and can not be easily carried away like a piece of cheese.I placed the traps on cardboard I cut away from a large cereal box . This will make it easier to handle the disposal of the intruder.I was a bit worried that I will have trouble setting it up as due to a recent back surgery I ca n't put a lot strength into pushing on levels , but it was not hard . I had to push on the level until it caught a hook . The trap was fairly easy to set off , while I was moving it around to place in the right place it got set off . Luckiness I was not moving it with my hand . Note that it got flipped and moved about 2 feet away from where it was before it triggered.Ali Julia review	1
I had this very mousetrap in Logansport , IN for six years in a house rental and it served me well . I was renting an old stone house by a wooded area with a field next door . Not to mention , I 'm lazy when it comes to mowing the lawn , so it often became a field mouse paradise especially late in the year . I typically stop mowing in September waiting for winter . That means the mice are gon na come my way to get out of the cold and go crumb hunting or carpet chewing in my house ! I could hear the little sneaks in the evening when in bed . Knawing on the carpet edges , or some box they chewed into of my food . I wanted them out . I noticed down in the half basement they liked the smell of salt near the top of the water softener . I could tell by the dropings . I bought one of these mouse traps , and baited it with Andes mint chocolate . Mice appear to love the stuff . I jamed it into the little hole and set the trap near the salt smell . It was n't a half hour later I got one , and scored three on the day ! Over the next few years every time it got cold the mice would sneak in the house and I 'd clean them out with the trap . It usually managed to get them all , one year I got over 30 . A huge accomplishment for one little trap , at the time I 've never bought a second . The beauty of the thing is that it 's easy to set using the second bar , and easy to release the dead critter . A hungry cat lived nearby , so I would fling them over the fence by pulling on the second , no-touch mouse bar , and kitty would finish them off.I moved into a `` new '' ( new to me anyway , built in 1955 ) house a little over a year ago in Fort Wayne , IN . I noticed the past owner left out mouse poisons in several areas . I could n't have them around because my little dog Sandy would probably eat them if he found any . I searched the web for this type of mouse trap , and lucky found the same one I used nearly 15 years ago in Logansport . I bought two for me this time , and two for a friend , and it took only one day to clear out all five mice in my house . My friend said his apartment was clean in just a few days . I still baited with chocolate , he used cheese , but I think mice prefer the Andes mint chocolate bars better !	1
Its the old fashioned spring loaded - knock 'em dead trap . Safer to handle compared to many others of this type and the most effective of the traps i used this very & # 34 ; mousy & # 34 ; season	1
Great mouse traps . an upgrade to the wooden ones . My mice were licking the peanut butter off the wooden ones so i got these to try . the same night i caught one . These things will get them becaue they have to use there legs to trip the trap .	1
There really is n't all that much that I can add to whats already been said about these new fangled traps . Let it just be said that they are best design and have the best function available if you are in the market or favor the old fashioned original traps we all grew up with . I 've been setting mouse traps for over 40 years and have never really gotten my finger smashed . Yet I still shudder and am nervous every time I set one . Everything in the old traps is there and exposed and you fully have to pull back the spring action to set it . This trap utilizes a V shaped mechanism where the trap and spring handle are split and half , and only a fraction of the strength is needed to set it and get the same deadly tension . You simply lift the handle that is standing straight up to release the victim in the end . Also , this trap employs a small cup for bait as opposed to the inefficient little hook thingy that for too many of us I 'm afraid , has only served as a buffet for many a mouse that managed to get the meal and make a successful escape . The little cup necessitates the mouse digging at the meal with the tension platform totally surrounding it . I have never seen yet a mouse escape with the meal with this thing in charge . This is it folks , the proverbial better mouse trap . It 's cheap , always available here on Amazon , ( they are also carried but often are sold out at my local Lowe 's ) and most of all they do the job they are intended for just great . My highest recommendation ...	1
Of the newer snap traps , the Snap-E Mouse is the best built I 've tried . It 's made to last awhile . Unlike the traditional traps , the Snap-E makes disposal of the victim 's corpse much easier ; no touching the mouse and an extremely easy to operate release mechanism . Definitely worth a little extra money .	1
I get no joy out of killing them , but the voles have driven me to this . Nothing has worked , not the castor oil , the bleach , the ammonia , the commercial pest deterrents , or the dish detergent . This week I set up traps , some the old fashioned wooden types and one of these Snap-E traps.I 've only caught one vole ; it was with the Snap-E within hours of setting it . Set up is simple , no tricky bar to set . Filled the bait cylinder with peanut butter and pulled back the metal bar until it clicked into place . Removing the dead vole was easy too . Wearing gloves I lifted up the bar so the vole could drop to the ground . I buried it right there.It 's an unpleasant business , but the Snap-E trap is efficient and effective.Update - I 've caught two more voles with this same trap . Removing the vole is so much better with this trap than with the wooden one .	1
But not mine . It has managed to set off one of 3 I have set up , but it avoided getting caught , just as it has for 3 wooden d-Con traps . When I got these I was very optimistic because the bait is actually hidden and the mouse would have to investigate the smell and put its hand on the trap releases to get a better look at the food . Nothing seems to trick this mouse . I do n't know what to do . It 's been 2 weeks since I set up these traps.Does anyone have any food suggestions to bait with ? I 've tried peanut butter , walnuts and ranch dressing .	1
For years my family has relied upon the original old-fashioned wooden mousetraps to catch any mice that might be roaming around . Recently , it seems that the mice are becoming smarter because they eat the cheese & peanut butter clean off the trap without setting them off . After this happened a few times , I decided to try to find a better mousetrap and came across this SNAP-E MOUSE TRAP.The trap works on exactly the same principles as the old wooden traps . You place the bait in the middle of the trap and pull the spring back to set it . The difference is that the trap has an incredibly strong spring . Because of this , the trap is made of a sturdy plastic.These traps are incredible ! There 's no chance of the vermin licking the trap clean because the trap is very sensitive . Also , with the powerful spring on the trap , they are killed instantly.I have tried using other types of traps before , but these SNAP-E MOUSE TRAPS are by far the best mousetraps to catch & kill a mouse with . Highly recommended .	1
Used this with my plants this year and I really think the extra nutrients in it have helped them grow .	1
Just works for what it should . It amends soil and is clean ie no bugs . Other than that I have not a lot else to say .	1
I use earthworm castings to feed my plants and to provide some free earthworms that seem to come with the product . I guess there 's eggs in the sack . I also use castings to spread around the base of any plant that 's having white fly trouble . Seems the flies do n't like castings and so they leave . I add a few cup-fulls of castings to each potted plant too .	1
Most people have already said what needs to be said.Excellent product , good for TLO mixes , composting and top coating n teas.One more word , seriously.LMAO !	1
Bought this to use in the potting mix for my peppers and it works great . Once you 've got your plants potted use this stuff ever 3rd week with a rotation of CalMag and Fish Emulsion and your peppers will really love you and POP !	1
I have an old mallow bush that has had a white fly infestation every year beginning in the spring and running into November . It is the only place in my yard where whiteflies have been a problem . Because the honey bees love the mallow flowers , I have not wanted to use a systemic or spray with harsh chemicals so the white flies have been right at home there for ten years or so . In early March this year I placed about a half bag of earthworm castings on the ground under the mallow , spreading them several feet on all sides of the bush . To my delight and surprise - no white flies on the mallow or surrounding area this year . They 've moved away from my yard . The honey bees are not at all turned off by the castings and continue to enjoy the flowers . Now that I 've seen how well they work , I will never again be without a supply of earthworm castings . I ca n't believe I did n't know about their benefits earlier in my gardening adventures .	1
Real easy to work with and no stink . It mixes in quick and my plants are happy campers . Life is good .	1
I 've used other brands of earthworm castings , but this is my favorite . As soon as you open the bag you can see and smell that it is genuine worm-poop . No , it does n't stink , it just smells earthy and composty , but very identifiable . My germination rates have increased tremendously , and better yet , the survival of my sprouts after germination as also increased . Since using this additive to my germination mixes , my success in the greenhouse has really boosted my confidence . I even started my own little worm farm , but they could never produce as much as I need , so I will definitely be purchasing more.My only complaint would be to the seller as far as shipping goes . ( subtract 1 star ) The bags are heavy . I bought 4 of them with several other items . They were tossed in one end of a long , narrow box , the other lighter items in the other end . Guess how my box arrived ? ! Duct-taped like crazy from the carrier ( thankfully ) because the heavy end of the box was totally ineffective for shipping heavy items .	1
_Depending on the plant you put these on/in , it 'll do a fantastic job . For what I grew , rumor was that I needed about five more products to aid in growth . This turned out to be pretty much the only thing I needed ( besides soil , of course ) . A definite buy .	1
Nothing like worm poo to help fertilize the garden . Worm poo is supposed to be spread at a rate of 1lb of poo for every 10 square feet . So be mindful of how/where you need to use this stuff . I purchase it for my raised garden beds . It is one of the things that I use to refresh the garden at the beginning of the season .	1
I splurged on this double sided feeder , and placed it outside my den window so that I could watch both feeding stations . This feeder replaced an older `` squirrel-proof '' feeder that had rusted away two years ago , and had been a sore disappointment in both the birds it attracted , and the squirrels who turned it into the neighborhood hangout.I 've filled this with a good quality backyard bird blend , and have been THRILLED with the birds we 've seen during the first week ! We 've had the usual cardinals , blue jays , and sparrows , but for the first time , we 've enjoyed chickadees and yellow finches . It has been a true delight to watch during afternoon feeding time.For over 25 years I 've maintained one or two feeders , and done very low-key suburban backyard birding , all in the same 1920 's heavily-treed neighborhood . I have to say that this is the most successful feeder I have put up yet in terms of the birds it has attracted , and the fact that no squirrels have yet made it their hang-out . As far as the seed spilled on the ground , there 's another group of birds that seem to find that attractive , so it is n't going to waste at all.The feeder comes with a perfectly adequate pole , as well as a hanging arm , your choice which to use in your yard . The pole put it at window height in my yard .	1
We 've been inundated by squirrels raiding ( taking over ) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home . After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews , we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder . It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed . The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want . I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating . Soon , the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed . We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it 's built like a 50 's metal toy truck , if you 're old enough to remember ! !	1
We are looking for another feeder , so when I got to this page I thought I would tell you why this is the one we 're going to purchase.We got our first ` 7536 ' feeder over 10 years and we still like it . For one thing it holds an entire grocery store size bag of sunflower seeds and for another the birds love it . Frequently both sides are filled with our feathered friends while there are others waiting in the tree for their turn . [ Thus our interest in another feeder . ] Presently we have Chickadees , Nuthatches , Cardinals , House sparrows , Wrens , Gold finches , the occasional flicker and small woodpecker visiting . When we lived it Texas it was convenient to exclude those pesky , though attractive , jays.Initially I think ( okay -- my memories a little faded after a decade ! ) it did keep the squirrels at bay , but that has n't been the case for many years . In fact , our local ` free-range ' squirrel has the glossiest coat you can imagine . But we do n't really care as he is so jealous of the feeder that he keeps other intruders away.The lapse in squirrel-proof-ness is probably due to years of collected grime and dust that clog the springs . That and just the passage of time.Four Stars . Our feeder is doing just fine after 10 years . I think the other reviewer is wrong in saying that this feeder is available for less money . I think what he has seen is the one sided version of this same feeder . I say this because we have searched around a bit in order to save money.And about the squirrels -- we saw a PBS special one time that showed what a gray squirrel would actually do for lunch . They had these squirrels climbing , jumping , and riding in little wagons through a long tube to get to a bird feeder . I concluded after watching those experiments that ` proofing ' was a ridiculous notion . LOL .	1
This has been my best 'Squirrel Proof ' Feeder to date and I now have six various kinds of feeders meant to keep out the 'grey hoards ' . When filled with mixed seed it also attracts the greatest variety of birds of any feeder I own , particularly Eastern Cardinals . Is VERY heavy when fully loaded and I found that hanging it is more secure than using the included pole . You MUST use a long and sturdy hanger to keep squirrels from hanging onto a branch or tree trunk and bypassing the weight triggered closing mechanism . Will keep out at least 90 % of your Squirrels which usually content themselves to forage on seeds dropping to the ground below the feeder .	1
This product is great to use along with Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat or just for 2-3 small to medium house plants that need extra grow light .	1
I received this grow light stand with light within two days of ordering it . Assembly took my husband ten minutes for stand and light fixture , He 's a carpenter so he can easily put things together . `` This is easy , it just takes common sense ! '' he commented . For someone like me who needs step-by-step instructions though , it may have taken me a bit longer . There are instructions for the light fixture assembly but he did n't even open those.He noted that the light fixture is slightly uneven on top ( the hooks are n't evenly placed ) but that is because an inch is needed for the electrical cord once the light is hanging from the stand . So do n't let the uneven hook mounts fool you . Once the lamp is hanging there is very little wiggle room for the lamp to dangle.And what a bright light it is . My little 10 '' x20 '' germination set almost seems too small ! Depending on how far away the light hangs from the seed box ( the distance is easily adjusted with the white cord ) this light could easily provide light for a seed box twice the size with regular rotations of the seed boxes . After 12 hours ofnon-stop burning , the lamp did not get hot.The stand is sturdy . But what amazes me is the brightness of the light . Just one lamp in the dining room provided more light than a night light at night . I may have to find a more inconspicuous place for this thing.All I have to see now is how long the provided lamp works . This stand is a tad expensive but if it provided the medium to grow seedlings evenly , it 's worth the price .	1
I purchased one of these last year and used it this spring for tomato and pepper seedlings . The ease of use and amount of light provided by this item was amazing compared to an old plant light I 'd purchased many years ago.I just ordered a second one and will give my old light to a friend.Since I had a lot of seedlings , I draped a mylar sheet over the entire thing and it reflected the light wonderfully.I really like how easy it is to adjust the height . My old light only has 3 static levels and you have to maneuver the entire light fixture on the arms from one setting to another.I 've already purchased 4 bulbs and expect the two lights to serve me for many years to come .	1
I replaced a very expensive growing system that uses proprietary bulbs and plant containers with this item , a few inexpensive clay pots and a shallow pan/tray to keep the pots in . Live plants I 've put under this light immediately start growing toward it and plants have much more room to spread out . I 'm just now trying to germinate some jalapenos so we 'll see how that goes , but just for keeping fresh potted herbs from the grocery store alive indefinitely this thing is terrific . A couple of transplants from the proprietary system ( cilantro and mint ) were struggling in their confined spaces but now are exploding . I bought a live basil plant from the grocery and it is thriving ( although parts of it are going to be sacrificed on top of a pizza tonight ) .My only complaint was that the power cord would n't connect tightly to the light fixture . It kept falling out . I did n't know whether the fixture or the cord was the problem and I did n't want to return the whole thing , so I went to Hydrofarm.com and sent a note via the `` contact us '' page describing my problem . In a couple of days a very helpful guy named Nick wrote back and said he 'd seen this before and a replacement cord had always fixed it , and could he send me one ? Long story short , the replacement cord he sent me did the trick . Thanks , Nick ! A minor thing to know : I put mine on a timer . I have timers all over the place but realized that this requires a grounded ( 3-outlet ) receptacle and none of my timers were 3-outs . So I got the Intermatic TN311 for cheap here on Amazon and it does the trick . No fancy stuff , you ca n't control it with your smartphone or otherwise do cool tech tricks with it to impress your friends and neighbors , but it is silent and it just works .	1
This was a little difficult to put together for me with my disabilities . But I did it ! I wish it had two lights . I tried to start seeds with it , but they do better in my Aero Garden . I 'm hopingIt will be enough to keep my pepper and tomato plants going until spring . The replacement bulbs are not all the same , so be careful that you get at least what you got with it . I 'm still trying to find some that are affordable and will do the job .	1
I had always just used a regular lamp and a south facing window . And only had limited and some what pathetic results despite years of trying . I finally decided to stop messing around . Put this on my Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy to get it . Combined with a seedling heat mat under my seedlings I am seeing faster and healthier growth in all of the seeds I planted . Many of those only sprout in full sun , and I do not think any of them would have come up without this lamp . Very excited , and have just ordered another one !	1
To address some things in other reviews:1 ) My Hydrofarm box was packed inside another box with padding materials , unlike others who 've complained that theirs was not and thus arrived damaged.2 ) The frame was not warped , twisted , or otherwise misshapen.3 ) Mine does have the blinds-like pull string to adjust the height quickly and easily , no s-hooks in sight.Those points addressed , overall , this is a solid product.Yes , there 's only a single bulb , so your plants may tend to grow toward it instead of directly upward . This product would not be a good choice for plants that are going to grow indoors and only indoors unless they have a single stem that can be directly under the light . It 's much better suited to starting seedlings that will be transplanted outdoors or moved into a cold frame after they 've grown a few inches.There are only two flaws in this product that i 've found : First , the cord for the light is stiff , and wedges against the frame and pushes the light into an odd angle . You can fix this quickly with zip ties or string or anything of that ilk . Just loosely tie the cord to the vertical bar of the frame , and the problem is solved.Second , it comes with two screws and two washers for each screw . In the assembly instructions , it says to use two washers with each screw , but then shows a picture of the screw , a washer , and a bolt . It 's left to the assembler to determine in which order to place the washers.For a backyard gardener or farmer who wants to get their plants started indoors , this will do nicely . If you need to do any intensive indoor gardening , this product will not make you happy because it is not designed for that . The reason it 's so inexpensive is because it 's a simple , cheap frame with a single light bulb . It does what it 's designed for and not a bit more .	1
This starting system is well built and perfect for starting your seedlings , the T5 light does a very nice job , I would even go as far to say it 's a must have for your home growing ! ! !	1
I was somewhat skeptical that a lopper could handle a 3 inch branch - that 's usually something that I would use a hand saw for . But this lopper actually comes through ! It 's the first lopper I 've used with a ratcheting head which took me some time to get used to . You open the handles wide and the head snaps fully open . You then repeatedly open and close the handles and the jaws ratchets shut until the branch is cut . While this may seem to entail a bit more work , it 's much easier on the arms and shoulders since you 're cutting only a portion of the branch with every stroke . The head locks in the closed position for secure storage.The extendable handles work well , and have a click stop every few inches . No problems with the handles extending or retracting unexpectedly.The head is an anvil type head , so it 's best used on dead wood since the anvil crushes the limb when cutting . Live wood is best cut with a bypass lopper so there 's a clean edge.I use this mainly to chop up cut branches into manageable lengths . Makes quick work of the process . Good build quality - hoping for many years of use .	1
This a very good tool and cuts very nicely . I agree that it does a nice job cutting , however , I give it 4 stars because the handles are a bit weak looking and flex easily when trying to cut live branches that approach 3 inches , and I am afraid I will snap the handle if I put too much pressure . That happens when the handles are fully extended or not ... so 4 stars . With that said , it works as advertised . It can be locked closed . Be careful and it should get the job done relatively easily . I just wish the handles were sturdier .	1
If you clear any brush this is the tool of choice . It will take off 3 inch branches with ease and the telescoping handles allow for a long overhead reach for limbing trees . I could n't get along without mine .	1
Works great , the humming bird loved it . I would recommend this to anyone , great product ! Bees do n't get caught in the feeder so it is wonderful	1
We 've seen Hummingbirds around our backyard , but never thought to put up a feeder . While I was looking for something else , this feeder was displayed ... The pros : + Reasonably priced & free shipping was included.+ Small 8oz size , with a nice shape ... easier to hold on to ! + Hardened glass+ Removable perch.+ Hanging wire is included.+ Small size = easier cleaning & fresher nectar.+ We have n't noticed any nectar dipping out of the feeder.The cons : - The attachment screw for the removable perch is steel , I upgraded ours to stainless steel.- The first feeder had to be returned , as one of the yellow bee guards was missing . The Amazon return process was very easy & I had the replacement within 2 days . Now that 's customer service ! & # 9642 ; Our homemade nectar : To make a batch of homemade nectar , we add 1/4 cup of regular sugar to 1 cup of boiling water . We use a 2 cup measuring cup , filtered tap water & 3 minutes in our microwave gets the water to a fast boil . Pour in the 1/4 cup of sugar , stir & let it cool . This is the exact amount needed to fill the 8oz feeder . We decided not to color the nectar , as most say it 's not necessary. & # 9642 ; Our cleaning routine : The cleaning is very easy & should be done at each refilling . While the freshly made nectar is cooling , we prewarm , then fill the glass bottle with boiling hot water & let it sit . No need to scrubing the inside of the bottle . Next we pull off the bee guards & set them in the sink to be cleaned by pouring boiling hot water on & thru them . The last item to clean is the base & perch . You guessed it , more boiling hot water is used to flush everything clean . No need to pull anything apart , the boiling hot water will get to all the nooks & crannies . Cleaning = piece-of-cake ! : ) & # 9658 ; Notes : & # 9642 ; It 's easy to tell when the feeder is completely empty , as the Hummingbirds will move from one flower to the next testing each flower for nectar. & # 9642 ; It disturbs the Hummingbirds to remove the feeder for refilling , so we do this now after dark . When we did this during the day , one Hummingbird would come within a couple feet to investigate ! & # 9658 ; Update - April 8 , 2013The Hummingbirds have started visiting our feeder , so I 've upgraded our product rating to 5 ! : ) & # 9658 ; Update - April 28 , 2013We have regular vistors now & it 's a real treat to have the Hummingbirds frequent our feeder . The formula we 're using seems to be perfect , as the Hummingbirds love it ! Not want wanting to be without a feeder , we decided to buy a spare one ... just in case ours needs to be replaced. & # 9658 ; Update - May 15 , 2013When the `` spare '' feeder was delivered , we were surprised to see the bee guards had been redesigned . Instead of the square shape , the bee guard is now rounded ... a more realistic flower shape . Today we installed those bee guards & right away we noticed the Hummingbirds spending less time probing & more time perched & feeding . Yes , the improved shape is a winner in our book ! & # 9658 ; Update - November 24 , 2013We never realized Hummingbirds stayed around our area this late in the year . We do n't get as many vistors , but they do come by , so we make sure the feeder is kept filled. & # 9658 ; Update - November 29 , 2013 - A problem & a solution ! & # 9642 ; It 's getting cold now & there 's a problem with the nectar freezing ! I had to use a hair dryer to melt the ice that had formed . This worked , but I decided a better solution was needed . I wired up a single red 7 watt , C7 incandescent indicator bulb ( like a Christmas or nightlight bulb ) & attached it to the glass ( touching ) with Velcro ties . This keeps the nectar in the upper forties when the air temperature is below freezing . I have a red bulb installed & the red light does n't look bad at all , especially at night ! I 'd post some picture , but this listing does n't allow pictures to be posted . : ( & # 9642 ; We noticed that the Hummingbirds perch on the side that has the bulb , so we think they enjoy the heat given off by the bulb as they feed. & # 9642 ; The temperature has dipped to 10F & there 's no ice forming on lower part of the feeder . The heat from the small 7 watt bulb ca n't keep the entire feeder ice free when the temperatures are too low . We notice the Hummingbirds like to sit near the light to keep warm while sipping nectar .	1
While I try to always keep plenty of flowering vines and plants around that are hummingbird favorites , I also make sure to keep nectar feeders available throughout the entire hummer season . They always seem to show a preference for certain natural flowers ; but there are many stretches of time when they 're feeding solely from the feeders.Several years ago , someone suggested to me that I put out my hummingbird feeders earlier in the spring ( early to mid-March here ) . The male hummingbirds arrive earlier than the females in order to find an ideal feeding and nesting spot . This gives them a leg-up ( wing-up ? ) on the other males in wooing the females when they finally arrive . Well , I did as suggested and it worked ! For the past three years , we have ended up with a nest in our large crape myrtle tree at the end of the porch . It 's been fun to watch as the babies begin to fly and drink at the feeder . Hummingbirds are devilish little things ... quite territorial and aggressive ( even with their siblings ) . Because of this territorial nature , I 've had to hang an extra feeder to reduce the squabbles . Hummingbird habits may vary by region or type , but having the multiple feeding holes on each of the feeders has been unnecessary since they fight each other off and usually only one bird will feed at a time.I 've been using this feeder in addition to theAspects 429 Hummzinger Highview Feeder . While the Aspects model offers the advantage of slightly better visibility of the birds when feeding , this Perky-Pet Pinch Waist feeder has one difference that I find very beneficial . Because it 's important to not leave nectar in the feeders for more than 2-3 days during very hot weather due to spoilage and bacteria build-up , this model by Perky-Pet is considerably less wasteful of the nectar . With the Aspects model , you must fill the feeder up to a fairly high level in order for the hummingbirds ' beaks to reach down through the hole to access the nectar . However , with this Pinch Waist style , I can pour just an inch or two into the bottle at a time ( rather than filled nearly all the way to the top as seen in the product page photo ) . When the bottle is inverted , even that small amount of nectar is immediately available for feeding . As a result , I 'm not having to regularly throw out and replace old nectar . I just put in however much nectar they 'll eat in 2-3 days time and then rinse the bottle with hot water and add more nectar . It seems to be the birds ' favorite feeder , too , since it appears to receive much more hummer traffic than the other one .	1
I have had several feeders that leak or the hummers do n't like it including the Aspects 153 & 367 models . I admit the Aspect model are easier to clean but if the birds do n't care for it ... I live in Florida where hummers at my location are not large as in Texas and Cal . So the size is better for refilling here . Bees are not a problem here and the yellow bee guards do not draw them to the feeder . In fact , I cut small hole in the guards so the hummers could feed easier and also I liked the contrast of yellow because I could have taken them off completely . As for the color you could paint them with hobby shop paint or just nail polish . Anyhow , I like it and the birds like it what else do you need .	1
Took a while , but the humming birds finally found the feeder . I 'm hoping we 're on next years rotation and they tell their friends . I had no idea humming birds were attracted to red ...	1
To begin with , we have and use a very large number of feeders and have for years . We have a very large number of different feeders which have been collected from here and there over the years . We have been using this particular feeder in our arsenal for about six years now - as a matter of fact at present we have five or six of them in active use.Like most things we purchase and use in life , there are good things and bad things about this particular feeder . Nothing is perfect and nothing is absolutely bad and useless . Most hummingbird feeders fall into the middle and probably one of the biggest problems with this feeder and other feeder is simply expectations . Some folks set the bar very , very high , while others more or less are willing to take the bad a long with the good . We personally fall into this category.Now let 's start with the positive : First and foremost , and I feel the most important , is that these feeders do attract hummingbirds and the little guys seem to like them . During peek season we actually have trouble keeping all of our feeders filled on a daily basis , ergo , we rotate the filling and cleaning session.Second , these feeders are extremely economical . To maintain and use as many feeders as we have would be a major financial strain if we used only the high end feeders exclusively . We have quite a number of these too , but hey there is only so much money in our household to devote to this one project.Third , the four perches provided are a welcome addition and I feel is one of the big attractions causing high usage.Forth , these feeders contain only 8 oz of nectar solution . This `` forces '' me to continually check them and since we maintain so man feeders there is less likely hood of my getting `` lazy '' and not changing the unused ( a rare occurrence ) as often as I should . There is less likelihood of cloudy and contaminated nectar.fifth , these are easy to hang in various locations and in winder they are quite easy to store and do not take up all that much storage space.Sixth , these are plastic and if you drop one , something that I frequently do , they will not shatter . It is discouraging to drop a 20 or 30 dollar feeder and spend an hour making sure you get all the shatter glass cleaned up to say nothing of the loss of money.Now the bottom side : First , these are not `` forever '' feeders like most of the glass feeders we use . They will over time , depending upon how much sun they get per day , deteriorate , become brittle and break . We personally get from two to three years use out of each feeder but at that is an acceptable cost for us.Second , yes , these things are just a bit more of a pain to clean than some of our other feeders . We do need to use special little brushes and to do the job right , they must be completely disassembled . This is not a great burden though and truth be told , I kind of enjoy the process and it gives me a chance to check everything out to make sure all is well.Third , the bee guard is not 100 percent effective . Small bees can and do get into the feeders and the guards are completely useless as to the ants we have here . On the other hand I find that a coating of Vaseline to the wire holding the feeder pretty well stops the ant problem and since these things are being constantly cleaned and refilled the few bees that do get in , while unsightly , are not that great a problem.All in all , for us , the positives far outweigh the negative . Is this the only feeder we use ? No , most certainly not . I took a look the other day and we have about 10 different feeders in use at this time . By the end of the summer we will have more when the birds become more active . Is this be very , very best feeder we have ? No , but they price wise and effective wise they serve their purpose quite well.We are quite satisfied with this feeder and will continue using them as long as they are available.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
I had n't put out a feeder for several years , but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside . He 'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights , making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small , affordable and had a bee guard.Thanks to Amazon , they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.He 's happy and I 'm no longer feeling guilty.These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted .	1
We really enjoy the free show right outside our kitchen windows where we have hung two hummingbird feeders . We have visitors from dawn to dusk , though they tend to go take a nap on really hot sunny days - perhaps the nectar gets too warm to suit them . It 's so interesting to watch the different feeding strategies - some hummers hover and dive in for quick sips ; others perch on the foot rest and guzzle . It is rare to see 2 or more birds at the feeder at the same time as depicted in the illustration , since they are quite territorial , but it does occasionally happen . The birds seem to have learned who refills the feeder . Several times when I 've been in the backyard weeding or watering , a hummer will hover right in front of my face , maybe 2 feet away , and make eye contact . I 'm sure he 's saying `` hey lady , the feeding trough is empty ! '' Sometimes they buzz right by my head when I 'm sitting out there reading . As I said , they 're always entertaining : ) We have seen some bees on the yellow part of the flower , but not enough to be a nuisance . The major issue I have had with the feeder is the tendency to drip after you refill it . I always bring it indoors to clean it under hot running water , then refill with homemade nectar ( 4 parts water to 1 part sugar boiled briefly until the sugar dissolves ) . When I refill it in the kitchen sink and carry it outdoors I invariably dribble a little sugar water on the floor . Do you know how hard it is to clean up sticky sugar water from the floor ? I should know by now that it would be better to refill it outdoors ! Others have criticized the plastic parts , which wo n't last forever , but at the price , I do n't mind having to replace it every few years . I had an all glass feeder a few years ago which was quite a pretty piece of art , but I gradually broke off all the flowers and perches , and it only lasted about a year ...	1
I love this feeder . I only have to fill it every three days as it is in the shade the majority of the day . I 've had mine well over a year with no sign of aging or even fading of the plastic parts . The glass holder is sturdy and has not broken even though I 've dropped it twice on my kitchen floor . I am ordering another one today while on sale . Glad would pay the full price for this , though !	1
The pinch waist glass container holds just enough nectar to be consumed before it spoils . Our delicate , tiny hummingbird guests enjoy being able to light on the little perches at each fake flower and drink without having to hover . This is a simply-designed , low cost feeder that performs well and does n't leak . I do n't see how a more expensive feeder could make our precious hummingbird guests any happier than this one does .	1
Cleans easily and the hummers seem to like it .	1
The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher . However , it makes it pretty heavy , so if you are using a window hanger , make sure its on there REALLY good . The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily , backing it a breeze to take down and refill . Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds do n't like to share , but it does n't effect its usage . Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days , but that would probably make it too heavy . Did n't influence my rating though .	1
We have lots of hummers and every year I seem to need to add or replace a feeder . This design is definitely their favorite .	1
Well , despite what Mr. One-Star Review says , we 've used Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders for years ( dare I say decades ) and love them . More importantly the Hummingbirds seem to like them.And do get the one with perches ! For regardless of what the sources tell you about the high energy levels of Hummers , when we 've had feeders with and without perches , they use the latter more . I mean , who does n't like to rest for a spell.As to accessories : Skip the special food . You can make your own 'nectar ' by using 1-part regular sugar ( not honey or brown sugar ) to 4-parts tap water . You boil the water briefly to drive off chlorine , then dissolve the sugar thoroughly . ( Do n't boil too long , you 'll mess up the 1-to-4 ratio . ) After the solution cools , you can then dye the sugar water red with regular household food dye.BUT do buy more bee guards . They are cheap and should be replaced every season as apparently Hummingbird spit is pretty disgusting , and the guards will get a mold that might not be entirely cleansed away and might make the birds sick next season.Finally , do take one of the bee guards off . We have a chickadee who has been coming for several years , who apparently has a sweet-beak . It 's funny to see him line up with the rest of our tiny friends.And whether you go low-end like this one , or high-end like some might steer you , make sure that you keep everything reasonable clean . This is someone 's kitchen afterall.Regards ! Pam T~	1
I purchased one of these feeders in the spring , along with one or two others of different design . It did n't take long for this to win the popularity contest . Before we knew it , this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles , while the other feeders were virtually ignored . We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet ( what an awful name ) feeders and now we have more hummers than we 've had in years . Around here , it 's mainly Blackchin and Rufous , but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage . There 's less chance of solution going bad , and the glass is easy to clean . We 're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days , so there 's little chance of gumming up . A little pricier than some feeders to be sure , but the birds sure like them .	1
A few weeks ago we helped my mother clean her garage and came across two of these feeders , both brand new and in their original boxes . Mom did not want them , so we gave one to a neighbor and brought the other one home.Nothing happened for the first few days ... we were initially a bit disappointed . Then , after two more days we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit . Following directions , we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week 's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started ! As week # 2 of our feeder experience got underway , the feeder emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day.Guess the word got out ! Now , in the middle of the fourth week the feeder is emptying every 2.5 days or so . We have wonderfully colored green , yellow , blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs , and they are awesome to watch . They love this feeder , flying in to land on a perch and sipping until content , then buzzing right off.Highly recommended ! Totally fascinating .	1
Often sold in garden stores , but the price here was better . It 's outside all winter ( down to 25 degrees ) and has held up well .	1
Our hummingbirds show up every spring , hover at the window until I put the feeder out . They seem to like this kind for some reason . I have had other types and they ignore them . Whatever works ! The hummingbirds have voted .	1
We 've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it . The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window . It 's a little inconvenient to clean but I do n't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window . The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy . It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants . It really works .	1
The old glass Perky Pet nectar feeder that still have is from the late 1980 's or early 1990's.Hope this new & # 34 ; Perky Pet Glass Nectar Feeder & # 34 ; will last as long as that old feeder is lasting ! With the construction being very similar i think it might . Differences being : new style has perches & new style has a threaded top & plastic cap where the old style did not have perches & it has a rubber cap & a grove in the top of bottle for a wire to hold the cap onto the bottle.The bee guards on the new feeder really do keep the bees out.If Looking for a glass nectar feeder that the hummers would like ; this one by Perky Pet would be an excellent choice !	1
MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS . I STATED THAT IT WAS CHEAPLY MADE BUT FAIR FOR THE PRICE . WITHOUT SOLICITATION FROM ME , THE COMPANY WROTE ME AND FOLLOWED UP . PRETTY AMAZING AS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS , NOT TOO BAD . BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE A COMPANY WHO WORKS THIS HARD TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED WITH THEIR PRODUCT . HAVE BEEN USING THE FEEDER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND IT WORKS FINE .	1
Buzz , my Anna 's male hummer who has claimed my yard and this feederas his own , seems to like this feeder . I have two now , I rotate them each weekas I clean , refresh them . They are a bit hard to clean , I use a toothbrush to cleanthe feeder part . The newer one is a bit different than the one I got a couple years ago , the perches do n't seem as good , seem a bit short , but , it works so far . Price is rightanyway , especially if you only have one or two hummers that use it .	1
I have several hummer feeders and about half of them are this one , which I consider one of the best . My only admonition is to clean it regularly and systematically , lest it become fouled with algae and other crud . Of course , this is something we hummer aficionados should do any way , right ?	1
I have 2 of theses and I get lots of hummers ! You must keep them ant free and clean and the hummers will come for food ! Be sure to change the food often , especially if they are in the sun .	1
I have another style of feeder , as well , but this one is the birds ' favorite . I 've found that having a couple of smaller feeders also works better than one big one . You waste less nectar .	1
There is something about feeding hummingbirds that creates an almost Zen like feeling . Watching them as the fly around and feed multiple times a day . They are actually quite friendly and many will fly within a foot of you or less and listen to you talk to them.We have had this feeder for several years and it is the best one we have owned . It is easy to clean up with the large hardened glass bottle and the hummingbirds like the perches to sit on . We like how the bottle screws into the base and then you can flip it and hang it . I even have a photo of a hummingbird , a monarch butterfly and a honey bee drinking at the same time.In the summer time the humming birds can drink up the sugar water like crazy . Now if I could only get them to stop fighting over it . They all think that they own it and they sit there all day long and guard it like it is their personal lunch line.Feeding hummingbirds is fun and enjoyable . This is the best feeder we have owned out of about 5 styles . Try it and you will like it !	1
I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly . This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup , which the birds love . It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder . I do n't think they like the perches , as they loved my old feeders which did n't have perches . They do n't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either . I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers , this feeder has flat flowers which does n't seem to attract them as much .	1
I received this feeder from Woodstream ( Parent of Perky Pet brand ) as a replacement for the wildly poorly designed 120TF model . Although it had a tiny initial leak , which took a while to detect , it was easily fixed and has been serving well since.After filling the unit for the first time with home brewed sugar water ( 1 part sugar to four parts water ) , I found that the birds seemed to be able to down a cup of liquid in no time at all . The tiny leak on the bottom of the unit showed itself after my wife and I noticed that one of the hummingbirds was feeding off of the BOTTOM of the feeder , licking the bottom inside of the rim . An inspection of the area below the feeder showed a building crowd of ants feeding on the occasional drips . At the next refill , I took care to find the lead site using water during the cleaning ( *** Note , I follow the instructions to avoid soap and detergent and use hot water . My experience is that hot tap water works great if you wash the unit twice a week as I do *** ) . After carefully drying the base , I used some liquid model airplane cement to penetrate the crack where the leak was coming from . Althernately , I could have used silicon rubber sealer , but my thought was that the glue would penetrate and seal the crack better while the sealer would leave a channel for the sugar water to be trapped in and breed bacteria . Also , the glue dries way faster and I had impatient customers hovering in my yard : - ) This quick fix did the job and the 210P retains all of its food for the birds . In our case , the three birds that frequent our yard in the SF Bay area drink about a cup every 3 days . So , I do not fill the whole reservoir ( 16 oz or two cups ) since the instructions , and most online commentaries , say to change the food out every 3 days or so to reduce bacteria growth and keep the birds healthy . BTW , if you leave your leak on the bottom un-repaired , it is also better to have less fluid in the tank because it will put less pressure on the leak and reduce the loss.Finally , if you really do n't feel like you want to repair a new feeder , Woodstream customer service seems to be quite responsive . A quick call and they will send you a new unit . Happy Hummer-watching !	1
My hummers had no trouble switching from the basic bottle feeders to this saucer , and I love it because it 's the oh-so-easy to clean . The built in ant moat dries out rather quickly , but I basically fail to fill it anyway , and have n't had any ant problems at all . I now have 2 of these feeders , that hang from shepherds hooks , and there 's no leakage problems whatsoever . Remember : change your sugar water frequently ; every few days , to avoid spoilage . I highly recommend this feeder.EDIT ( 04/2008 ) : I wish this feeder came in 8oz , since I do n't really need 16oz , and do n't get that many hummers ( unfortunately ) . But , I did also purchase a Hummzinger Fancy ( 12 oz ) , and surprisingly I just did n't like it . It was easy to clean , but was deeper than the PPO , which did n't appeal to me . I had put the Perky Pet on one hook on the south side of the house , and the HummZinger on the north side 's hook . The HummZinger did n't get much activity , which was surprising since the hummers are used to both hooks having a feeder . After 2 weeks , I put the HummZinger away and went back to 2 PP 's . Activity resumed on the north hook ... Considering both feeders are outside from April to November , and rinsed in hot water for every cleaning , they 've held up well . No cracking , minimal color fading , no flowers have needed replacement to date .	1
This feeder is very easy to clean and to fill . Lots of feeding stations . There are perches all around , and the hummingbirds appreciate this . Since there is no container above the feeding stations , you can see the birds from all angles , a big plus . This would be a 5 star product if the design was modified a bit . If the feeder was a bit smaller in circumference and a little deeper , it could still hold 16 ounces of nectar with slower evaporation and a little more stability when hanging . This is a good , functional feeder that 's reasonably priced .	1
This thing is great ! If I remember , I 'll upload some pics . Totally easy to clean . the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about . Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy , and it is a bit bigger than I thought it 'd be , which is not a bad thing . The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd 's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too . No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now , and later I 'll get a smaller one ( so it does n't hang quite so low ) . Other than that easily fixed issue , it 's great ! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1 ' feeder .	1
Well , Iike the feeder , easy to clean and hang , but the birds really like it much better than my more traditional one that 's like an upside down jar and that 's what matters , they like it . I think I 'll get another , but I like the traditional one as it 's hanging in a window , but still , the birds like this one better .	1
This feeder is HEAVY . That translates to sturdy . No more little squrriel teeth mangling up the finish and function . Three small feeding slots are located on the front of the feeder . the perch , where the birds sit themselves to dinner , is spring operated . It stays open until something heavier than a bird grabs it . This would be the squrriels . the perch pivots downward , closing the feeding slots . The spring is adjustable , so depending on the size of the squrriels in your neighborhood , it can be adjusted to thwart the little furball from raiding the seed bin . However , they may be able to hang from the roof of the feeder and reach some tasty morsels , but not a lot of seeds are accessible from the top through the slots . We use a variety of seeds , including sunflower seeds , and have n't found one that wo n't go through the slot from the supply bin.this is all metal , except for the windows , which are mounted into the feeder walls and serve as supply indicators . the top opens with the twist of the windvane . This is where you fill the feeder . It is a twisting affair to close and open the feeder , I do n't see how squrriels have the strength to open it , so that will end the pop-the-top burglars . It has a heavy handle to hang it with , or there 's the pole/base mount that comes with it if you want to place it on the top of a pole . It 's built to last .	1
When filled this is a very heavy bird feeder so be prepared with a steel hook on a post . I doubt that your going to be able to tree limb mount this due to its weight combined with the narrow space between the roof finial and the underside of the handle . But it is a lovely , well constructed , metal bird feeder with a weight sensitive perch . The squirrels can still eat anything that falls on the ground but between the slippery metal and that perch they wo n't be stealing from inside . And the lid comes off easily while still being able to fill and secure . The bright red color means you can easily spot it outside . This holds a couple pounds of bird seed .	1
I 've been working my way up to a large permanent bird feeder over the last couple years . We get some really beautiful birds ( Cardinals , Blue Jays , and a yellow crested bird that I do n't know ) and I love seeing them in the yard . But these feeders I 've gotten at the local stores do n't hold up . They weather poorly and break or look terrible after they fade in the sun . Which is exactly why I love this one ! This is a huge bird feeder , made almost entirely of metal , with a metal roof that helps water pour off it easily . This is n't going to break . And since the top is silver it wont fade there either . Overall , the construction of this feeder is great . Even the part that closes if a squirrel steps on it is metal ! How does it work ? The ledge that the birds perch on closes down and covers the food openings if too much weight is applied . This works great as birds wont push it down but squirrels will.It has the hanger you see in the picture and also a place in the bottom for a post ( it goes up in to the house about 4-5 inches , so is solid ) . The post looks to be about 1-1.5 inches think and fit on the end of my shovel.Top quality ! Highly recommended .	1
An extremely well constructed feeder , easy for owner to fill , but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed . Owing in part I 'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into ( either opening or chewing through ) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want . The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into . The simple , wide opening ( but securely fastening ) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder . My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder ! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders . christina & bogie	1
I received this very large box via UPS and could n't imagine what was inside . Unlike most things today that ship in parts in order to spend less in shipping but , consequently , may not be built as well in the end . While the main photo shows the front , the sides are equally as big and it 's nothing short of adorable.These are not cheesy plastic parts that will weather and crack . This is made of sturdy metal and the roof of the house is like a metal barn roof with a galvanized steel look.The weathervane is also metal and cut but polished with no sharp edges , just as a large one would be.The perch is made so that if birds sit on it it stays open , but anything heavier , like a squirrel , will close the opening.You have a door and windows to further taunt said squirrel to get to see the buffet closed for business until he can starve himself down to bird weight ... aww , such torture , Mr Squirrel ! The metal bar that holds the feeder is tough and meant to stay in place on a branch without ever breaking away.Truly a well made and adorable piece , sure to delight all the birds that can line up on the perch and feed together , and sure to torture unlimited squirrels ... ... fortunately for them , I also have a squirrel feeder . Werd .	1
This is an attractive high-capacity bird feeder in the style of `` The Tank '' as commonly known at the Audubon Society shop . It functions by closing access to the feeder when the squirrel puts its weight on the bar . Birds which are much lighter in weight than squirrels will not lower the bar and can feed happily and freely.Overall a much more affordable alternative to The Tank , the capacity of this bird feeder is 12-lbs and depending on how hungry/greedy the birds are in your area , the seed can last up to a week or more before needing to be refilled . This is perfect for skittish birds that tend to avoid areas with a lot of human contact.This feeder is also available in red and a green whereas the Tank was only available in green.The only caution/con is that a strong sturdy branch is needed to hang this from . Also this bird feeder needs to hung high enough so that squirrels will not be able to stand up and feed from the feeder by bypassing the weight trigger that closes access to the feeder.Overall highly recommended .	1
I have two of these feeders . I have had one up for about a year now ( We feed birds year around ) and the one being reviewed here has been up for approximately 2 months now . These two feeders are in addition to nine other feeders we have about the place . We live on five acres which we have turned in to a bit of a bird sanctuary . It is heavily wooded for the most part with a small orchard and garden on one side . We also have a very , very large squirrel , raccoon and possum population . While it is extremely difficult to count squirrels , I would estimate that we have at least 35 hanging about the place . I like squirrels for the most part but they are a pain and it costs a lot of money to keep them fat and happy . With our large number of oak trees , hickory and orchard fruit ( in season ) the little tree rats do quite well for themselves.First , these feeders are quite easy to mount . I have them both mounted on small tree stumps I have had to cut that were too near the house . They are relatively easy to keep filled . They are designed to discourage squirrels and so far both have been quite effective . I have had no mechanical problems with them so far . There are a couple of things to note and remember when using this particular feeder . First ; keep in CLEAN ! Each and every birdfeeder you own and use should be thoroughly cleaned frequently ... very frequently . These feeders are NOT water proof and the seeds in them will get wet and if you do not keep the wet seeds out they will gather mold and mildew . Not only can this be deadly for the birds , it will eventually cause the spring mechanism to malfunction ... the gunk will build up . Maintaining bird feeders properly is a lot of work ! Secondly , if you have raccoons , be assured that a determined raccoon and absolutely destroy one of these feeders in very little time ! They can and will dismantle it . Hey , a raccoon can dismantle a Sherman tank of there is food involved so a feeder ... no feeder , stands a chance if they set their little minds to it.Third , birds can be and are rather sloppy at times . The spill seeds . Due to the designed of this feeder , this wasted is at a minimum but still and all there is some spillage present which ends up on the ground and thereby attracting squirrels and other critters to the general area . Not much you can do about this.Forth , it took out birds a little over two weeks to get use to this particular feeder . It was slow in attracting birds at first but once they `` caught on '' both feeders are as popular as the others we use . Do keep in mind that birds react differently in different parts of the country , a fact we have noted after living in a great many parts of the United States . This review involves country birds living in the Missouri Ozarks . For all I know east and west coast birds may hate the thing ... .you just never know about such things until you give them a try.Fifth , when you clean your feeder , use just a very , very , very small amount of 3 in 1 oil on the movable parts . By doing this I have been able to avoid and mechanical problems.This feeder , while possibly just a bit pricy , is very attractive and a pleasure to view . We have been very satisfied with both of our feeders.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
I have owned this type ( not brand ) of feeder for decades , and it is the single-most effective way of enticing a variety of birds while discouraging squirrels . The perch bar is counterweighted so that anything heavy will pull it down and close the access to the seeds . It 's a simple , brilliant design . This Perky Pet version is a good implementation and improvement upon the original design.The Perky Pet has one major improvement over the last feeder like this that I owned : metal perches . Frustrated squirrels gnawed through the wooden perch on my last feeder , and I kept having to replace them with wooden dowels . I also like that there are two perching spots in front of the seeds , one for smaller birds like goldfinches and one a little farther away for larger songbirds such as cardinals . On the left side of the perch , there 's a weight adjustment lever to set the sensitivity of the closing mechanism . I wish Perky Pets had provided a quick set guide to show which setting was the most/least sensitive so I did n't have use trial-and-error . The most sensitive setting will close the door when too many small birds or some large birds , such as jays or grackles , land on the perch . The galvanized metal roof is not as attractive as a painted version , but the rest of the feeder looks nice.The top of the feeder opens by twisting the cardinal weathervane on top about a quarter turn . The center part of the roof lifts up . I really dislike how difficult it is to align the latch and close it . Especially on a cold , windy day , I do n't want to be struggling with finding the inside hole while my fingers are going numb . Otherwise , the construction is first-rate , with squirrel-proof metal and an inaccessible ( for squirrels ) plastic windows . ( Anyone who has owned a feeder with a plastic feeder with an exposed edge knows how quickly squirrels can chew right through it . ) Because I have mine mounted on a tree , the deer can empty it if they put some effort into it . The squirrels can not .I also own the Perky PetSquirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder , and that works well , although birds such as cardinals that prefer hoppers or trays often stay away . Plus , this one has a much sturdier construction . If you are only going to get one feeder for your yard , I recommend this one. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
There are many things you notice right off on this feeder . It is all metal , very attractive and built very well.I am impressed ! ! I loaded it up with bird seed and within 2 days the birds adjusted to it and actively feeding . As you can see by the picture there are clever designed `` windows '' so you can easily see the amount of remaining seed.Included is the heavy hangar and again clever designed mounting system with screws so you have options on how and where you place it . I do have it mounted under cover , but it appears to be water proof with its tin roof and painted body . I would n't hesitate to put it out in the rain.This would make a great gift for yourself or for someone else .	1
I received this bird feeder and I was really impressed with how sturdy it is made . It will be very effective at keeping squirrels and field mice from hoarding my stash of bird seed . It should last many seasons . I really love the baked-on red enamel and the nice tin roof . I am well pleased .	1
I ca n't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard . But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts . They do n't bother my other feeders . They are like little monkeys in the yard . I like to watch the squirrels . However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks . I have black oil sunflower seeds in it . The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable . I have mine hung from a garden hook .	1
I love this feeder . It is a little bit bigger than I expected , but I absolutely love it . I especially like the weathervane on the roof , which is also the latch that opens and closes the top . The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and has n't jammed or anything like that . An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out ; I have n't figured out what adjustments I need to make , but it is a neat feature . Overall , I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it .	1
I love my wild animals , especially birds ! I have several bird feeders and love to attract as many birds and variety of birds as possible . My one or two problems are squirrels and big black birds . I was thrilled to see this adorable Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird Feeder . It is just so cute ... just like a little red barn with a weather vane on top . It is also very well constructed . It is working great at keeping the squirrels out of the bird feed . My squirrels can empty a feeder in just a little bit , but not this one . I love watching them try and try to get food out of it . I do n't want to hurt the squirrels as my husband suggested using a BB Gun on them so I am just so happy that they will not be harmed , but also ca n't clean out the feeders . 5 stars !	1
This feeder will most certainly light up any back or front yard , it is THAT pretty . The paint is a solid and thick laquer , and I like the metal perching bar instead of wooden dowels which can get chewed away by annoyed squirrels over time . The feeder has a large solid hanger and also comes with pole mount.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the filling access . This feeder top loads , and in order to open the roof piece one must turn the squirrel weather vane . Opening the roof is easy , but closing it again requires some finesse and delicate realigning of the inside lock . One needs to be able to look inside to get it realigned , so mounting the feeder on a high pole as we like to do is out of the question . If the company can figure out an easier way to lock the roof this will be a solid five star feeder .	1
As is often common for me , I 've ordered something and did n't read the size of the item and it is waaaay bigger than I expected . I thought this would be the size of most average bird feeders ( softballish size ) , but it 's about 3x that size ( basketball size ) . I realize I 'm comparing a square shape to round with that , but I could n't think of anything else of similar size that everyone might understand ... So , other than my shock at the size , I was pleasantly surprised by the quality workmanship on this bird feeder.It is made of metal , with the only plastic piece I can see being an adapter you can put on the bottom if you want to be able to mount it to the top of a pole ( but it also has the heavy gauge wire you can hang it from that you see in the picture.Another reviewer commented that blackbirds can sit on it without activating the drop-down that blocks the seed ( which is how it prevents squirrels from getting the seed , a heavier critter , when it steps on the perch area , causes it to drop down and close off the access to the seeds . ) However , there is an adjuster setting on the left side that allows you to change the spring tension making it more sensitive or less sensitive to weight . I 've found it to be fairly sensitive and not a problem . HOWEVER , the one thing I do worry about is the way the mechanism closes off the seed access - I 'm worried that a critter could have it 's beak or toes in the seed area before the metal part drops down and the critter might be hurt or get something caught when it drops down . This is probably pretty unlikely , but it was something I noticed none-the-less.As mentioned in other reviews , the feeder does not come with instructions , but I found the use to be pretty intuitive . The little mini-weather vane on top of the house locks and unlocks the access for filling the feeder ( when unlocked you then lift the panel from the top that the weather-vane is connected to and a large area is opened to use for filling ) .I agree with the other posters who say that the red color attracts the birds so they quickly check it out and find the seed.All in all this is a great feeder , I do wish it was a bit smaller , but that 's my own problem as I should have read the dimensions rather than assuming it would be the size it 'looked ' in the picture .	1
I 've had this feeder up for over a month and have observed the following : It 's heavy , very heavy ; too heavy for a shepards hook so I placed it in my apple tree . It 's also big and holds a lot of seed . I have the red model . It 's pretty , very attractive and looks great.It 's not squirrel-proof but is squirrel resistant . Since the feeder is in a tree , squirrels are able to jump on top of it . They hang upside down on it and slobber all over the feed ports while trying to get the seed out . They do n't get a lot of seed but they make a mess while trying and at the same time annoy the birds.Several times during the night an animal , I am guessing a raccoon , was able to remove the feeder from the hook , throw it on the ground , and then try to rip the top off , slighting bending the sheet metal . To the feeder 's credit , most of the seed did remain inside although the critter was able to slightly bend the metal up a bit on one side . I 've added a piece of duct tape to the side that has the gap . [ Update : I found the feeder on the ground a few more times so I added a small baffle on the hook above the feeder . This appears to have solved the problem . The critter has not been able to remove the feeder from the hook . 7/2013 ] The weather vane knob that opens and closes the top fill area does n't lock securely . It could be improved if the manufacturer adding a grommet to give it some tension . It pops open very easily and several times I 've found it undone . It 's also difficult to get it back on after filling.The spring tension adjustment hook on the perching bar is ineffective . When a critter jumps on it , the hook pops out and there is no longer any tension and large birds will not be able to eat.The inside of the feeder has sharp edges so it will be a little challenging to clean inside . The outside ports are already getting gummed up for a rainy week and squirrels licking it , but the outside cleans up easily.The feeder is water tight . After a rainy week the seed inside remained dry.Birds like the feeder . The first birds to appear were the House Sparrows and Cowbirds . The shy birds like Cardinals and Goldfinch waited a few weeks to make it was safe , but now all the usual feeder birds are eating from it . I tried various seeds and even a mix . I get the best results from black oiled sunflower seeds.I have owned many different types of bird feeders and all have their faults . The only way to make one squirrel-proof is to put it on a pole with a baffle where squirrels ca n't reach . This feeder is a decent compromise for someone who wants to hang a pretty feeder in their tree . A plastic , light weight feeder would be eaten and shredded in days . This one should last for years.UPDATE : Sept 1 , 2013Not chipmunk proof . For the past week the little critters have been climbing the tree , dropping down over the roof of the feeder , sitting on the top of the bar and filling their pouches . By sitting on the top they are not heavy enough to close the deterrent bar even on the lightest setting . I added a squirrel cone to the hook above the feeder but they are still able to climb over it . Once the chipmunks go into hibernation at the end of October this problem should go away . The birds still enjoy the feeder and it really does prevent most squirrels from gaining access .	1
Squirrels seem to give up very quickly on this feeder , as their weight closes off access to the feeder tray . While that is a great , money-saving aspect of the feeder , and I really like the large size ( fewer refills ) and level-check windows , the downside of this type of feeder is that it limits visits from beautiful larger birds ( woodpeckers , cardinals , blue jays , etc . Finches , sparrows , and wrens seems to only visitors due to the small landing area it offers .	1
It is nicely constructed . It is made of metal , so it will hold up . The perch is weight triggered so larger animals like squirrels will lower the perch and block the food . You can also adjust it dependent on the size of the birds in the area . You can adjust it for larger or smaller birds . It is larger than I expected and will hold plenty of food . If you twist the Weathervane , it will unlock the the panel on the top for easy access for refilling . It also comes with an attachment ( including fasteners ) that you can place on a stand and you can place the feeder on the stand , easy to place and remove from stand . Over all this is a nice feeder .	1
I must say , I was thrilled to be able to get this through The Vine ! ! These types of feeders are SO expensive ( but really , they 're worth the price because they work ! ) . Thirteen years ago , when we bought the home we live in , there was a similar type of feeder ( adjustable , spring level ) squirrel proof feeder mounted on top of a pole in our back yard . I was excited because I 'd never owned one and wanted to see first hand how ( and if ! ) they worked . I was super pleased with the results ! Still have that feeder , same place ... and it 's going strong ! ! I must say , that the older one is heavier duty than this one ( no clue on the brand , but there are some out there that are more expensive than this one from The Vine ) ; but this one still does the job ! I love that it holds so much bird food . We feed black oil seeds exclusively and they work great in this feeder . The lever/bar shuts when the grey squirrels attempt to get to the food : ) ~ we have little red squirrels that use the feeders and I do n't mind them at all ~ they are not hogs and they do n't make a mess ; ) ~ they can still get the seed because they are very light in weight.This feeder , as I mentioned , is not as heavy duty as some you will find on the market , but again , does the job equally as well . There are adjustable levels ( spring activated type ) , so you can decide which you want to try out . I always keep it at the lightest possible level because all the birds ( but no grey squirrels ) can use it without an issue ~ even bluejays . It comes with a heavy duty ( attached ) handle as you can see in the picture , but it also has a mounting bracket so you can put it on a post . The weathervane twists to come off . That is where the seed goes.Highly recommend this feeder so far !	1
This feeder is quite large , and holds up to 12 lbs . of bird seed . It may be more feeder than you need , unless you have a huge number of birds visiting your yard . The size can make it hard to find a good place to hang it , unless you have a shepherd 's crook . It also comes with the hardware required to attach it to a post rather than hanging it.I 've hung mine very low on my rhododendron bush so my ground-feeding birds will feel comfortable using it . Even with it so close to the ground , there seems to be no pilferage from squirrels or other furry creatures . Just do n't hang it so low that the squirrels can eat from it without stepping on the bar . Their weight on the bar is what causes the feeding ports to be blocked.The feeder is quite sturdy , made of metal except the windows , which are plastic . On my feeder , the bar that sits across the front for the birds to perch on does not sit straight across . It slants down to the right , which makes the whole feeder look slightly lopsided . It 's not a big deal , and the birds do n't care , but if you prefer symmetry , it could start to bother you after awhile .	1
Perky Pet 's feeder is big , beautiful , and bright , a beacon for our birds who found it within an hour after it was hung . It was disconcerting that the feeder came with no paperwork , but I did figure out how to fill it with seed , and how to adjust the tension . The weather vane twists off for filling , but it is a little tricky to line up for reinstallation . Fortunately the feeder holds so much seed that it wo n't need to be filled often.The fit and finish of the feeder is very good ; I 've found no paint blemishes or defects . My one complaint is that I wish the weight sensitive perch that closes when squirrels stand on it was a bit more sensitive . A large blackbirds can alight on the perch at one time and devour quite a bit of seed ; I 've noticed that two blackbirds in the perch at once can close the door to the seed . We have another squirrel proof feeder in the yard that seems to be more sensitive and closes access to the food more readily when large birds try to gorge themselves.Bottom line - This is an attractive feeder that our squirrels have n't figured out YET .	1
This is a good sized feeder and it looks good in the yard . It seems to be a favorite for the smaller birds . I 've had it in the yard for a couple of weeks now and the squirrels have so far ignored it . Be careful when you are handling this feeder because the edges on it are very very sharp so use care when taking it out of the box.Updated review several months later : The feeder has been out in the yard for several months now and it still looks good . However , the squirrels have now discovered that can climb onto the top of the feeder , unscrew the latch , push it off and then they climb inside and have a picnic . So I will have to come up with a way to make it so that they can not unscrew the latch .	1
I put them pout . I saw a few birds pecking at it.The price is good . it looks , texture wise like good suet to me .	1
These work very well , the only problem now is that one only lasts 2 days at the most so I limit to how many I put out , usually 1 a week along with other bird feed too	1
Time to re-order , the birds seem to love it , so do the squirrels . One will last about 4-5 days unless a raccoon comes along , they 'll eat the whole thing at one time . I 've wired the suet cage shut so they ca n't open it but they 'll sure put a big dent in it . I like to give back to nature since we 've taken so much from all the wild animals .	1
Song birds really enjoy this..woodpeckers not so much	1
I bought this case of suet cakes for my new suet holder . I was trying to attract more birds to our yard in our new house . The birds ( mostly the woodpeckers ) have really enjoyed these suet cakes . It is a great price for the case of 12 . I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with how much of a success these suet cakes have been . I will definitely be purchasing more in the future .	1
Like this one , I use them both and mix outside for the birds , Much cheaper this way then one by one at the stores.Love it , well , the birds love it ...	1
Glad to have discovered these ... Heath Outdoor Products DD5-12 Suet Peanut Cake , Case of 12 ... just started building a Bird Sanctuary and am learning about different types of bird food ... .and feeders ... .These are great so easy t just peel them open and drop in the feeder .	1
I 've stayed away from suet for quite a few years because what I 've seen in feed and pet stores are small cakes that would be fairly messy to handle . When I finally bit the bullet and ordered the Heath Suet Peanut Cake , I did n't expect much . However , they are well packed , fill the suet cage fully , and reasonably priced for the case of 12.It took two days before the Chestnut-backed Chickadees found it . Then word got around and we had Oak Titmice , Black-eyed Juncos , Bewick 's and House Wrens , House Finches , House Sparrows , Scrub Jays , and our ever-plotting squirrel ( Sydney ) come to the feeder two to three times a day.I put the suet at the end of a relatively flexible branch in our tangelo tree . That stymied Sydney ; he just could n't hang on , so now s/he waits on the ground for whatever scraps may fall . And the positioning is a good way to control the Scrub Jay . They 're a little too heavy to get a good footing ( `` beaking ? '' ) on the feeder and lose balance , but not until they 've taken a tiny chuck of suet . That 's where Sydney comes in again.Anyway , we 've never had so many chickadees and finches and wrens before . Heath 's Suet certainly seems to please the palates of locals .	1
These suet cakes are great for those that have a bird feeder with the square holders on them . All types of bird love these , including cardinals , blue jays , wrens and others . They also last for a while as week..usually a week for us as they have lots of visitors eating them .	1
The birds really seem to love this flavor - I 've tried others , but they prefer this one.Regular visitors to this suet include Blue Jays , Downy Woodpeckers , Hairy Woodpeckers , Red-Bellied Woodpeckers , Flickers , Titmice , Chickadees , Nuthatches , Carolina Wrens , and even a Baltimore Oriole ! I use this suet in tray feeders , hanging feeders , and I cut the squares into 4 pieces to use in the log feeders ( it 's much cheaper than buying suet `` rods '' for the log feeders . ) Highly recommended .	1
Sunforce 50032 15 Watt Solar Battery Charger - I have installed it on my Boat to keep my electronics deep cell batteries charged . Trolling motor batteries mostly . Works well . Pricy , but what is that money for anyway .	1
I purchased 6 of these for a backup system for my home . Two Northern units and 4 Sunforce units all 15 watt . ( these are the exact same units btw , northern 's are cheaper ) . With two inverters , a 2500 watt , and a 300 watt pure sinewave for computers and such . Hooked through a 7 amp charge controller to a pair of 110 amp hour deep cells in parallel for a total of 220 amp hr's.I first hooked two panels up to see how they did , they worked well in very low light but could n't ever get the batteries to `` full '' on the controller . I then hooked up a third panel and that gave enough to bring the batteries to full after a full day . With six panels hooked up , it will bring the batteries to `` full '' in a very few hours from a 30 % drained condition.These units are less then optimally placed and rarely get full sun , but do very well even without that . Two panels in full sun may very well have been able to bring the batteries to `` full '' but location is a problem for me . One other product of note is the P3 international `` Kill A Watt '' electrical useage meter . Doing a survey of electrical useage in my house to get ready for this project was an eye opener to say the least.Great panels , at a good price , that do what you pay for ... all you can ask for .	1
I bought this , then bought the set of 4 that comes with extras . Works like it says but for the money your better off buying the set .	1
It comes with a nice long cord which was long enough to reach from the corner of the room of my RV down the refrigerator vent where I connected it to my 7 am charge controller and ran a wire underneath to the battery . This cord has a plug on the end to connect to one of several connectors included . ( No wire splicing necessary ) . It comes with connectors for connecting to a cigarette lighter , alligator clips for connecting directly to battery posts , as well as a connector that just splits off two wires with the insulation already removed for you in case you need to wire them directly into something , or extend them with more wire . It also includes a LED test light that can plug directly into the solar panels cord to test whether the panel is working.I have attached two of these solar panels to the roof of my RV camper . They keep the battery fully charged even with the propane detector still using electricity . I was able to screw the panel directly into my rubber roof with the screws provided with no problem . They are very secure and they were a great investment .	1
This is a sturdy , well built solar panel which is great to keep batteries topped up . They are only 15w each so do n't expect a lot of power but they are small and easy to install . I have 4 .	1
Puts out 24 v in Sept PA sun @ 15 w power . With voltage regulator and deep cycling storage battery with or without inverter will keep your house/ shed/ workshop low amp tools and lights running from sundown to bedtime . I have cut my electric bill $ 10 per month with this unit so in two years it will have paid for itself including all accessories . Great panel , great shipping .	1
Sunforce 7 Amp Charge Controller - I installed this on my boat to charge one battery for my electronic fishfinder and chartplotter . It is still working and keeps the battery charged well .	1
I have two 20 watt solar panels connected to this controller , along with eight 7Ah 12V sealed batteries on the output side . I 've had absolutely no problems for the last three years ... the batteries charge up during the day and feed my yard lights for a few hours each evening . It 's worked reliably as annual temperatures cycled from near freezing to 105+ degrees .	1
Functions just as advertised-please see my other reviews to see what you can use it for . Much better than jury-rigging an old auto voltage regulator as it automatically protects from overcharge or overload . A car regulator will fry unless its an old fashioned electro-mechanical and that would be less efficient than this product . Great item !	1
I was looking for a short hose to put between a faucet and the control center for my irrigation system ( connectors , timers ) so I can place the connectors on a stand which is easier for me to reach . Photo of my set up attached under customer photos.Turns out it is difficult to find a short water hose . Even though I do n't need a water hose rated for drinking water this hose was the right length and I got it . Overall it works fine : the length is good and it handles my high water pressure fine . However , the connector to the faucet is plastic and even with a brand new washer and Teflon tape I have a small leak . Nothing major but you can see in the photo that the mulch under that connection is dark - it is always a bit wet . I do n't have any other connections that leaks so I know how to make good connections with the aid of Teflon tape . The long hose with a metal connector that was used on this faucet before did not leak , so the problem is with this particular plastic connector.This hose is not totally perfect , but it has been at work for a few weeks and overall I am pleased with it.Ali Julia review	1
I bought this so that my dehumidifier could drain directly into the sink instead of collecting in the basin . It connected easily and has not leaked yet . The length was perfect for my application . Seems like it will last a long time .	1
Said to be drinking safe , this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose . On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering . The connections are tight . I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season , OR replace them with new rubber ones . I do this on sprayers as well . Maybe that 's why I had no leakage problems .	1
I must have six or eight of these small hoses . I always find a use for them ! When they are on sale , I purchase several to keep them on hand .	1
These work for the purpose I bought them , but what a pain to have to run to the store and buy washers for them . I bought five of them .	1
This is a good quality water hose that is safe to drink from.I keep a bowl of water outside my workshop door so the dogs can drink whilst they are out with me . I was always wary that water sat in the regular garden hose could have leeched chemicals , and I would be tainting the water of my four legged friends . I now use this hose instead . Piece of mind , for just a few bucks.Some reviewers appear to have been shipped hoses without the rubber washer . If you dont use a washer , then it will leak . Mine came with the washer and does not leak . The washers wear out over time and need replacing , I keep these on hand : Gilmour 01RW Rubber Hose Washers	1
I have a spout in my garage that sits about two feet off the floor . So I needed a short length hose to use for filling up buckets , watering can , etc . This fit the bill perfectly . Install was a breeze and it is well made , so it should last for a long time . The only draw back for me was that the hose is way to stiff . It sits in a curled up position and always retains back to that position no matter what I try to do to remedy it . Overall not a deal breaker for me as it has exceeded my expectations .	1
I positioned the fly trapper next to my double doors leading to the deck . I am surprised how many insects it traps -- I did n't know so many were visiting . I like it because , of course , it works but also there is no odor to deal with and changing glue boards is a snap . The boards are cheap enough to keep it relatively clean all the time . A good investment .	1
Must be working because I Am seeing fewer micro-flies flying across My screen . I lost the glue trap so put some Black Flag fly paper next to It . But I really want an Electric fly swatter that runs 24/7 on house AC Its a joy to the ears to hear that popping .	1
Bought two of these to try to deal with mosquitos that sneak into the house . Have caught quite a few small flies and gnats , too . Ordered an extra pack of glue strips . Be careful to slide the strip in properly and it will be catching flying pests right away.Nice that these are for inside use but an on/off switch would be a good addition . To turn off , you have to take out of wall socket . Since the light is pretty bright , I only put them on at night when we leave the rooms or if we are going to be gone for most of the day.A variation that might also work would be a model that could be plugged in but then attached higher up on a wall where the glare of the light would not be in human sight all the time . Like the large units you see in commercial buildings but scaled down for residential use .	1
I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works . I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box . I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full ! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up . Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing . It works great ! _Bottom Line_ I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often !	1
I have tried and tried to fild a product that would get rid of those pesky knats ! ! and fruit flies around the house , and I must say I HIGHLY recommend this product , and is the only thing that has worked well thus far . I keep this running day and night and you would not believe the amount of knats and fruit flies this thing catches ! ! You better buy more sticky pads , because this thing will sure get filled up quickly . This product receives an easy 5 star rating form me .	1
Some seasons , I get a lot of small flying insects in the house , mainly because I like to operate my whole house fan . The main offenders are gnats and small mosquitos that get through the bug screen on my windows . This unit is great because no matter how small , these bugs will stick to the glue strip . I bought a spare bulb and spare glue sheets jsut to have them on hand.My only wish is that the unit would add a power switch . I only operate it at night ( makes a good night light in the hallway ! ) and must physically unplug it and set it down to turn it off . Either that or a darkness-sensing switch .	1
This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue . Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap . These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white ! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light . Once they are on the glue board they are stuck , period._Bottom Line_ Yes , I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you ! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats !	1
These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap . To be clear , this is not a standalone product , they are designed to be used in the `` Fly Web Fly Trap '' .The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit . This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the `` Fly Web Fly Trap '' verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips , Fly Catcher Trap , Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack , with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended , if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH	1
These pads are great ! ! and the only thing that I have used that is 99.9 % effective with knats and fruit flies .	1
Talk about & # 34 ; stick to. & # 34 ; This board has it . I positioned the fly catcher next to my double doors leading to the deck . I am surprised how many insects it catches -- I did n't know so many were dropping by . I like it because , of course , it works but also there is no odor to deal with and changing glue boards is a snap . The boards are cheap enough to keep it relatively clean all the time . A good investment .	1
Holds a ridiculous amount of flying nasties that you do n't like . Cost is one dollar per sheet , and sheets can last 3 days ( if you live in the rainforest and leave all your windows open , or about two weeks if you live in a normal urban home.I live deep in the woods in the Midwest , and change these about once a week and the house is free of all flying buzzers and buggers .	1
These work and fit fine into the original units , Web Fly Trap by Gardner , as advertised . And while not cheap , not terribly expensive .	1
This glue board is for use with their Fly Web trap ( [ ... ] ) . THis is a great product because unlike bug zappers it is safe . it also catches very very small flying insects like gnats and baby mosquito 's .	1
I have tried several hummingbird feeders and while I 've only had this one a few days it should be great . It comes apart easily . The liquid goes in the bottom section so nothing has to be turned upside down for filling which should eliminate sugar water dripping . It even has a built in ant trap in the middle .	1
Do n't even bother buying another hummingbird feeder . This is the best . It 's easy to clean and refill . And the built-in ant moat works great . I bought the smaller one last year , and the hummers LOVED it . So I upgraded and bought the larger one for next spring . Now I 'll use both in separate locations so they do n't fight over it .	1
Easy to fill . Easy to clean . Easy to judge when a refill is necessary . Ant-proof.What 's not to like ? I have 3 and they are busy all summer long .	1
Hummzingers are the best feeders . It 's easy to clean , and attracts lots of hummingbirds . I have another smaller hummzinger feeder , and am happy with that one as well .	1
Attracts the hummers amd keeps them around . Much easier to clean than the glass bottle variety .	1
I feed birds all winter and the sparrows , cardinals , finches , etc . - all come to eat . In past years water that was n't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them . I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink , as well as , eat all winter . It 's very economical to use and the birds think it 's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath . I 'm very pleased with this item . I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our & # 34 ; feathered friends & # 34 ; going over the winter .	1
This piece of equipment does a respectable job of keeping at least a little part of the surface of the bird-bath free of ice during the winter . Once the temps get down close to zero F. , there 's not much open water left for the thirsty birdies , but it has never allowed the surface to totally freeze over .	1
And has n't GOTTEN to -20 below ! It 's the end of January here in CT and we 've had several nights of 0 to 15 below ( including wind chill ) . I just went out to check on the birdbath and it 's iced up solid as a rock . There is n't even any remote warmth towards the top of the & # 34 ; De-Icer & # 34 ; . I gave it a four star because I truly like this thing ! It 's worked through anything above 0 up until this point . I 'm really not sure that anything 50 watts would go to -20 , but I figured in this part of New England , I would n't have to worry . I 'm hoping it 's not broken at all , but I 'll have to wait and see if it does its job when it gets a little warmer ( like in the teens or twenties ) .Again , four stars , because it was totally worth it up to this point and we do n't get this bitter cold weather here very often ( or for very long periods of time ) . I just thought it should be mentioned so prospective buyers would be aware : )	1
I used this during the Nebraska winter with temperatures regularly dipping into the single digits . The de-icer keeps the water warm enough for algae to continue growing . Of course , the area of ice-free water will depend on how cold it is : After all , this thing is not a 1000-watt power hog . When temps dip into the single digits , I typically see about an 8-inch diameter circle of ice-free water . User submitted pictures illustrate this accurately . ( My bird bath is about 2.5 inches deep at its deepest point ) .It is my understanding that birds do not bathe during the winter because of the danger that their feathers will become wet and subsequently freeze . Therefore , I do n't think it 's important to keep the entire bird bath ice-free . Instead , birds just need enough clear water for drinking . Indeed , drinking is all I 've seen them do during the winter , even on days when the entire bird bath is ice-free . Because of that , I see no reason to buy a super warm energy hogging de-icer.The cord is heavy duty and the de-icer itself has some weight to it . Still , I put a brick on the cord to keep the de-icer situated properly in my bird bath.I get more birds at my bird bath during the winter than I do during the summer ... most likely because it is the only source of unfrozen water for some distance . Squirrels also enjoy the open water . I 'm very pleased with the purchase .	1
Bought this in the summer ( much cheaper then ) and put it out about 2 months ago . We have our own `` homemade '' fountain which consists of a large pot that holds about 10 gallons of water and a shallow dish on top.This product is able to keep the water liquid , combined with the moving water from the fountain . Night time temps have averaging about 15 F. The birds have been flocking to it.The cord is very , very short , about a foot long . That is one drawback because you will need an outdoor extension cord . It is sturdy and does not get too warm . You can easily pick it up with your bare hands when it is running.Did not notice the impact on the electric bill .	1
This little heater is actually one of the few products I have ever purchased which was far better than even advertized . I have three birdbaths and have one in each . These work wonderfully and I have had no problem what so ever even on the coldest days and nights . I also have a smallish fish pond near my porch and I have used two of these things in it . As with the birdbaths , they work perfectly . Normally I have to remove the fish during the winter , but so far have not had to go through that chore . We live in an area where we have frequent freezing weather but never down into the single digits so I do n't think that will be a problem . People do not realize that birds drink during the winter months as they do during the summer and that this can cause them problems if they do not have a reliable source of water . I must say that the squirrels and other critters that surround our place enjoy it too . As I said , this is a product that I truly got my monies worth from .	1
Well constructed and made of heavy brass . Valve turns smoothly with little effort . Will definitely buy more . The black plastic ring helps you hold it while attaching it to the hose .	1
I GOT SEVERAL OF THESE AND PUT A QUICK CONNECTION ON THEM TO USE ON THE FAUCET TO SLOW THE WATER FLOW BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE THE FAUCET TO SLOW DOWN THE WATER FLOW IT WILL EVENTUALLY CUT A SMALL GAP IN THE FAUCET CAUSING IT TO LEAK AND THEN IT WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED .	1
Must have shut-off valve so you dont have to keep running back to the main valve to cut the water on/off when changing attachments .	1
I was looking in the big box stores for this , but all I found was plastic or a poly type . Gilmour makes quality items , and you can rest assured it will stand the test of time .	1
I was n't sure if I should buy it . Glad I did . Solid product . Easy to connect and turn ON and OFF . Does not leak . Just feels solid . Able to use grip to apply added pressure when tightening . Good product for the price .	1
High Quality materials used . I purchased to replace a low-quality plastic one I previously bought elsewhere . This one appears to be made of heavy metal .	1
I hooked these up to all my garden hose attachments so I could put a quick connect on my hose . Before the quick connect I put on this brass shut off valve . Now I dont have to run 100 feet to turn off the water , or kink the hose to switch attachments.. I love it	1
I bought a couple of different Gilmour Brass Shut-Off Valves as a way to block water flow from leaky outdoor faucets . There are better and more expensive alternatives but this valve works just fine for me . Replacing the washer in a faucet here in the Atlanta area by a plumber will run about 85 bucks or more . You can do it for a lot less yourself if conditions are favorable for you to do so . By that I mean if you have easy access to turning off your water supply and you have the tools and replacement washers to do the job . Or , you can take the easy way out and attach this valve to your faucet and have control of the leaks . Some outdoor faucets do require washer replacement to stop the leak because of the way they are constructed . I am fortunate not to have that type . My only complaint is that the Bosch Corp chooses to have these valves made in China rather than creating jobs here in the USA . But this is a review of the valve itself so I must give it 5 stars and a big BOO ! to the Robert Bosch Tool Corp for pimping jobs in China though they have a presence in Peoria IL .	1
This is solid compare to the similar plastic connectors . I also found the valve easier to twist . My wife can even twist it off and on . The large female side allows the connection to be made flawlessly and drip proof .	1
I needed a shut off valve when cleaning a spa with a hose vacuum . This one is surprisingly well-constructed and functions easily and well .	1
I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house , and I love them . They are practically indestructable , and exceeds my expectations . I have them hooked up to hoses , bypassing our water softener . I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well , which are equally as good . A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors . If corrosion does take place , it can become very difficult to unscrew it .	1
I ordered these as they were not plastic and were made of brass . They are heavy duty and work well so I am glad that I purchased them .	1
This is exactly as advertised . It is a solid piece , feels substantial and does exactly what I wanted . The price on this was dramatically lower than the same thing at the local big box store and hardware store .	1
Works great to get seeds started and roots going ; especially along with using the Hydrofarm JSV2 2-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System	1
I placed seeds into a miracle grow potting mix , watered , then covered up the dome and in 3 days every one of the 12 species had sprouted to about an inch tall ( or more in the case of fast growing sunflowers ) .Echinacea , red lettuce , romaine lettuce , snap peas , orange sunflower , red sunflower , chives , 4 different heirloom tomatoes , and dill - all of them are growing like weeds . As soon as they 're big enough for transplanting , I 'll be using it again to sprout another 12 or so species for the spring garden.The moisture level is pretty constant after te first and only watering 10 days ago , since you can keep the dome mostly shut ( or open it up if that 's too wet ) .My only complaint is that the dome dribbles water when you move it since the set is designed with the clear plastic dome on top/over the edge . But , that was nothing a tea towel under the seed bed does n't fix . For the price , I really could n't be happier !	1
This simple and inexpensive pad has been WONDERFUL . The difference it makes in sprouting my seeds is incredible . At first , I cautiously placed the pad and greenhouse on a table , fussing over it . Now , its on the tile floor ( with a towel underneath to keep the cold ceramic tile from leaching too much heat ) and works well without notice.It comes with a plastic egg-carton like tray to start your own seeds with your own soil . However , I 'm lazy . I just put one of those square trays with the soil pellets in them ( $ 5 from the hardware store ) to start my seeds instead ; fits and works perfectly.I will not be without this ever . Temperature is great . Keeps a consistent warmth into the soil.STRONGLY RECOMMEND .	1
This Hydrofarm hothouse with heat mat is a simple and effective way to start your plants from seed . The heat mat in particular will last you years and years most likely . The hothouse itself is of questionable manufacture , being a flimsy plastic , but it does what it is supposed to perfectly . There is a vent on top and one to either side of it as well to help control the temp and humidity if you dont use a guage . The 72 seed cells are likewise nothing special , but are again , quite effective . I have placed a variety of seeds in this , from tomatoes , to peppers to quinoa to tobacco , and everything tends to spout within 4 to 7 days . Anyways , even though of flimsy manufacture , the price is right and the goods are effective , so i give this 4 stars accordingly . Just be gentle with it , and if necessary , save the mat in the event that you damage the hothouse.Enjoy !	1
I bought this item to start seeds and try my hand at cloning for the first time . In both regards it has performed to my satisfaction . A few points : - The dome is thin plastic . I mean like solo cup thin . It would n't take much to completely destroy it . My small accurite thermo sitting on top makes a nice dent in it.- It leaks . The condensate on the dome rolls down the sides and out of the edges . This could have been easily fixed by making the dome fit inside the base instead of the outside . Try not to put anything you do n't want wet underneath this.- The heat mat , despite being several layers of plastic below the grow chamber , keeps a nice amount of warmth and humidity in the dome . On last measurement I was at 89 % RH and 81 degrees with half the top vent open . The ambient temperature of my basement is around 65f.- It 's big ! From the picture it just does n't look all that impressive , but when you get the box you realize this guy is pretty large . Make sure and check the dimensions ! - The holes for the inserts fit rapid rooters perfectly ! Following some simple direction was all that was needed to achieve successful results using this item . I filled the base of the item with Ph adjusted water just to where the bottoms of the cups were submerged . Soaked my rapid rooters in Ph adjusted water as well and dropped my seeds/clones in . Plugged in the heat mat and set it under my 2ft T-5 fixture . Within a week I spotted a few seeds germinating , and my clones looked just as good as the day I clipped them . A week after that my clones had put on a decent amount of roots . Mostly I have been screwing around with cloning just to see if I could do it , and I am 20 for 20 thus far.I think the real trick is to just leave the damn thing alone . The more people fiddle around with the top off the more time it takes building up the humid environment again . That 's my trick anyways and it seems to be paying off . I will only take the top off when it is time to transplant.I read several negative reviews about this item before I purchased it , and for the most part they are correct . Despite being happy with this product I deducted a star because of the slight water leakage . I mean there is a electrical device sitting under this thing that leaks water . I 'm no electrical engineer , but common sense tells me that one should take precautions when using this thing.Once again though it is the price that makes me recommend this . You are n't going to find anything even close to this price that has the utility of this item .	1
Bought this for my floral/dried flowers and spice business.The heated mat is the answer for it 's ease of growing.My plants for the garden were germinated and on their way , even when growing season was delayed .I bought two and now have a garden growing mostly from seeds ( great seeds available on Amazon )	1
Some have said that they thought this was a bit pricey for what you get . I agree - the little hot house is lightweight plastic , and they could have thrown in the peat pellets . I can buy a 72 peat pellet hot house by a competitor , with the pellets included , mind you , at a big-box retailer , for about $ 7.HOWEVER , that one only has a 2-inch transparent plastic top on it - and this one has 7 inches of growing room . In addition , this has some simple but effective adjustable vents in the hood - both ends and in the top - which are useful to control the humidity level.Since I had to go buy the pellets anyway , I got the 2-inch hothouse they came in . I started my seeds in it , and now that they 're up , I 've moved thed them to the Hydrofarm product , which offers increased growing space.What you 're really paying for is the Heat Mat . It 's a great idea to have a consistent heat under germinating seedlings ! Before it arrived , I tried a few basil seeds in a kitchen window , and one night it got cold . Bang . Poor little guys are casualties.Now , in the Hot House with the Heat Mat , all my babies are fine , thank you ! By the way - you will need aHydrofarm MTPRTC Digital Thermostat For Heat Matsto control the heat - sold separately.I 've got them both , and they work well together . You plug the Heat Mat 's electrical cord into the Thermostat , which plugs into the wall . Oh yes - the Thermostat comes with a probe you place inside the Hot House , where it can read the actual temperature your seedlings are at.Recommended !	1
Very happy with the product . The heat is consistent and I love the ability to adjust airflow . The only suggestion and reason for 4 starts instead of five is that condensation tends to drip out . The plastic could have been moulded with the lip turned up and drain ridges put in which would have kept the condensation in . It does n't pour out or anything but I 've had to put a piece of cardboard and a garbage bag under the unit to prevent it from ruining my table . Also happy with Amazon shipping to Japan for me since , even with shipping , it 's cheaper than what is available here . Will definitely be ordering more Hydrofarm products in the future .	1
When I first opened the package , I was disappointed . This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks . If you 're expecting a heavy duty piece , this is n't for you . It seems to do the job though . The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest , so do n't expect anything mind-blowing . On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity . I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover . As long as it does n't fall over and get stepped on , I am sure I 'll be happy . One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin . I WOULD buy this again , although I 'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks .	1
I looked at many different hose timers and settled on this one because of the high ratio of 5-star to 1-star reviews . There will always be a few units that do n't work properly or a few people that are hard to satisfy but this timer should please the most critical of users.This unit does almost everything that a standard , multi-zone sprinlker timer does except have multiple zones . You can select days to turn on or two or three days between waterings . For each watering you may specify up to four time periods with a start time and a duration between 1 and 360 minutes . The timer section easily slides off the valve body so you can program it at your kitchen table without removing it from the faucet . From the time I unpacked this device to the time I installed it and started its use took approximately 30 minutes . Let me tell you how I am using it.I had a deer problem with my front gardens . They would eat my flowers . I purchased a Scarecrow motion-activated sprinkler ( see other review ) and set it up to try . It was wonderful and completely eliminated my problem . Having determined that it worked , I wished to eliminate the need for me to turn it on at night and off in the morning . That is where the Orbit timer comes in . I connected the timer to my faucet via a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector ( see other review ) and now have a deer-proofed yard without fiddling.Note that the timer requires two 9-volt batteries in a relatively watertight compartment and you must supply these . Not a problem in my book as it insures that I start with fresh batteries . They should last all season according to what I have read . So , as long as it works properly and lasts a few seasons , I wo n't complain .	1
This unit works reliably as described and being able to remove the programming module is a real benefit , but there are some shortcomings that need to be considered . On the plus side , the thing works . That 's important to me as I tried another that was n't so reliable and since I 'm on a well and would be away when the unit is on , having it function correctly ranks very high on my list of required features . Even if the battery runs out ( it 's suppose to last all season ) the unit quits in the off position , so the water is not left running until the well is dry.A feature that I like very much is that the electronic module slips out of the spigot attachment bar easily so you can see the screen better for programming or reprogramming . Sometimes a spigot is located where visibility is poor and it helps me particularly because the screen is not large and the instructions on the flip up cover are really tiny . The programming would not be intuitive to me , but with the instructions right there , it 's easy enough.Thanks to other reviewers , I had the two 9V batteries on hand , but did n't heed the advice to have a Y connector on hand for a second hose for manual use . I thought I could easily reset the unit to allow that . Well , you can hand water by pushing the button for manual operation , but then you also have to set the number of minutes you intend to be watering manually , after which it resets to auto/run , and you ca n't just hit the program off button because 'off ' does n't allow water to flow.The problem is I have no idea how long I 'll be using the hose manually . It could be the standard 10'ish minutes of watering the hanging baskets , but I may want to alter that routine for some reason this time or I may be interrupted or maybe the dog bowl needs filling or a trash can needs to be washed or the car . You get the picture . In short , I do n't know how many minutes I need and do n't want to think about that every time , nor hold the + button for lots of minutes just in case . That 's just way more effort than I want to put into using the water for a dozen reasons ( especially when it 's over 100 outside ) . Having the Y connector avoids that problem if the timer is to be installed on a frequently used spigot.The other brand I tried before ( that I returned for non-performance ) allowed for two hoses so I had n't considered the extra annoyance of switching repeatedly from the hand-use nozzle to the sprinkler , nor the fact that my main hose is white and does n't look very good snaked out through the yard to the sprinkler location ( normally it 's wrapped up after each use on a hose cart ) . Sigh . I 've now ordered a Y connector and have to wait to hook it up . ( Yes , I know , why did n't I just drive in town to get one at the hardware store -- well , I did , and the dumb thing leaked , so I 've ordered a higher quality unit . ) Who knew this would be so complicated.I do wish I could review my watering program as with the other unit , but that is n't an option with this one . It does show the time and day and you can push various buttons to see what you 'd set as start time and duration . Speaking of which , you will not want to reset start time very often because the buttons are rather hard to push and you have to hold the + or - button forever while it starts at 12am and moves up or down by the minute ( not hour then minute , just minute , all 60 of them each hour ) to reach your desired time.Bottom line , I 'm not thrilled with some of this unit 's features , but it works and that is the top priority . With a separate hose for other watering activities , I 'll be satisfied with this timer to handle my automated watering needs and feel confident while I 'm away .	1
This timer looks good and works well . It is easy to program or to change functions such as days to water , watering time , etc . The ability to remove the control section from the valve is a real plus , I set it up in the cool of my house instead of our 100F+ Texas heat . Reliability remains a question . We have only had it about a month , but so far it works well . It feeds a 12 psi pressure regulator and 150 ft of soaker hose , a very nice setup ! Update 10/2010 . We are approaching the end of the second full season of use with this water timer . It has worked flawlessly . For reliable operation , depending on use , you have to be prepared to replace a battery at least once per season.Update 5/2013 . We are in our fourth year using this Orbit watering timer . We are ordering a second one as our garden is expanding . Usually we put the unit in storage for the winter , however , as it rarely gets below 20 deg F , and does not freeze for extended periods , we let it operate year around for the past year . The only problem we have had is corrosion on one of the battery terminals ( that occurred several years ago ) , that supplies power to the valve . A thorough cleaning solved that and operation has been reliable since then .	1
I have an odd birdbath arrangement on my deck that allowed me to test this unit 's effectiveness . There is no question the birds prefer it , and though I still find mosquito larvae , there are fewer . I have two identical birdbaths next to each other and found that when I added the Water Wiggler to one , the birds went to it exclusively over the other . It was so obvious they liked it , I bought a second for the other bath.Last year I replaced two end tables and temporarily stored the old ones next to one another on my deck covered with a tarp . I had removed the glass that had been set in the tops when I stored the tables and then a heavy rain created pools in the rectangular depressions . I noticed that the birds found this arrangement just right for bathing as the depressions are shallow and the space is good sized . Since I enjoyed watching the birds drinking and bathing , I decided to leave the tables there , but the standing water caused mosquito issues so I purchased a Water Wiggler to deter that and set it in one of the depressions . Almost immediately , the birds gravitated to that space leaving the other unused . Now both pools have Water Wigglers . I still check them for larvae and algae and have to replace the water regularly , but that 's easy and the birds are happy . While I have a well-attended normal birdbath in my backyard , some birds wo n't go to it . The thrushes and warblers apparently are n't comfortable there , but do come to the deck baths with the moving water.I found one set of batteries kept each unit working all last summer and fall . I replaced the batteries this spring and they are going strong . They seem to be quite sturdy as visiting night creatures sometimes knock them over or even out of the baths , but I put them back in each time and they show no signs of complaint .	1
I have owned this little unit for over a year and it works great . Why ? It is hard for birds to judge the depth of the water when it is not moving so they may pass over your bath thinking that it is too deep . ( this may sound silly to us , but it is true ) . I get 2-3 times more birdbath activity now . You still have to clean your water and I remove the Wiggler before winter . The batteries last many months . Honestly , the price is a little steep for what it is , but it is worth it for what it does - attracts more birds . It should last many seasons with proper care .	1
just recently bought this and it keeps the water moving which is what I wanted . So far it has not attracted any birds in fact it only about 5ft away from a mounted smaller bird bath which they do use to drink from , they just ignore this one but I will give it time and see what happens .	1
I use these pruners to cut flowers and bring them into my house . They are sharp and can cut through rose and peaony stems very easily . The size of the pruners make them easy to carry around in my back pocket and compete other yard work before getting the flowers . They are worth the money .	1
Does snip well but parts are plastic thus do not feel it will last a long time , It is a good prunner for rose bushes etc , m and for the price a good item	1
If you have rose bushes , the Fiskars Pruner is a must have . I love fresh roses in the house but hate those pesky thorns and always had a heck of a time removing them . With the Fiskars Pruner , I was able to remove all thorns rather quickly ( it only took one or two times to get it down ) and found the pruners to fit really well in my hand , eliminating any hand discomfort . The blade is sharp and shows no sign of rust after using them for a season . This is a really useful tool and I absolutely would recommend others to purchase !	1
These pruners worked great on my rose bushes . I love to bring in fresh flowers and the thorn stripper was perfect . I was able to ensure I did not prick myself at all . The blades are super sharp , and I appreciate the handles being a reasonable size . They were very comfortable to for long use .	1
This little hand held Fiskar 's trimmer is perfect for cutting flowers to bring inside for a floral arrangement . It worked nicely to trim up my rose bushes as well . Fiskar 's really makes good quality hand held trimmers .	1
Purchased this snow removal tool for my wife , who uses her car on a daily basis for work . While the car trunk is already filled with an assortment of semi-helpful gadgets , assuring her safety on the road , the Sno Brum is unquestionably in the top 5 . The tool is simple , effective , and does & # 8220 ; what it says it does & # 8221 ; easily . The tool doesn & # 8217 ; t scratch the car body , is lightweight , and yet durable . Don & # 8217 ; t hit the snowy roads this winter without it ! All the more in Connecticut , a state in which a regulation will go into effect whereby cars may be fined up to $ 1000 for excess snow and ice flying off .	1
The Sno Brum works beautifully in plain , regular snow . It has a large foam & # 34 ; pusher & # 34 ; that pushes show from the windows and surface of the car without stratching the surface of the car . It is fabulous . It can handle anything from a light dusting to several inches of snow ( anything deeper needs to be done in layers or shifts ) , and makes it fairly painless to clear the car.However ... it is not perfect . It does n't work well in two different situations.1 ) The Sno Brum will not work well in any snow that has even a small amount of ice and/or freezing rain mixed in . It ca n't deal with ice at all . To be fair , other snow brooms ca n't handle ice , either.2 ) The Sno Brum does n't work well against any irregularities in elevation on the surface of the car . For example , it does n't do well against the windshield wipers , against moon and/or sun roofs , etc.Overall , I am quite pleased with the Sno Brum and would recommend it for most winter weather situations .	1
Huge help moving snow off the top of my SUV . This makes snow very easy to remove even off of tall roofs . Takes just seconds to clear roof . It does not scratch the car .	1
Construction seems a bit flimsy but it works and I havent had any problems with it . Its great for clearing snow off cars ; especially large SUVs .	1
How could I have missed this before ? The Sno Brum makes snow removal so much easier and faster . Best of all , IT WO N'T SCRATCH YOUR CAR ! GREAT PRODUCT !	1
This is as good as advertised for a car and I 've used it for that and will keep it in the car . But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops . I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10 ' extension pole . The handle that comes with it wo n't quite reach all the way across the cover .	1
it is working as advertised to keep the squirrels away . they 've jumped on it only to see the doors close . so far though I have n't found the answer to keep the sparrows off of it and that seems to keep the cardinals from using the ring . they come to the area but limit so far themselves to the seeds that have fallen to the ground .	1
the birds love it ! got this for my husband to watch the cardinals and after just a few weeks we have to refill ... and none of it because of squirrells . it 's a nice size so we do n't have to change it every day .	1
So far my squirrels have n't penetrated or figured out how to get to the seed . My two racoons decided to unhook it out of frustration and try and dig the seed out on the ground but I saved it and hung it up again and so far nobody has bothered it and the birds love it . Very durable easy to fill and hang and holds quite a bit of seed .	1
We are enjoying this feeder so much ! the squirrell free mechanism works great and the adjustment allows us to cut off larger undesireable birds as well as squirrels . we especially get a kick out of watching squirrells trying to access the food. ! It is also very easy to refill and we have not had any issues with the feed getting wet or clumpy . Well worh the extra money !	1
Cardinals can get seeds , squirrels ca n't . Well made and relatively solid . Not really easy to clean , but not unexpected with weight-triggered closure device . Recommended as an affordable squirrel proof.UPDATE : I can report that this feeder is actually bear-proof ! Well , almost . It survived a bear 's attempt to get through the plastic sleeve . It was a little hard on the spring mechanism , but the bear did n't get any of the seed !	1
This feeder works so well , I brought a second . I have alot of squirrels and most have given up . I must confess a couple have leaped from the pole to the perch , but it closed and they gave up . They try to come off the top and try to chew on it , since it have a metal top , again they given up or fall off trying to stretch to the feeder opening . This feeder is about squirrel free as possible . I have loads of cardinals , finches , titmouse , woodpecker and no problems landing on it . It is expensive , I have seen ones in Wildbirds Unlimited for $ 100 . Worth the money .	1
This is a big feeder so refilling is minimized . While little birds can enjoy several models , medium sized birds need the extra perch space this feeder provides . For whatever reasons , the Indigo Buntings prefer this feeder even though they 're small and the Rose-Breasted Grosbeaks do n't fit on the small perches of my other feeders so this is the only one they come to . The little birds use it as well as the others.Squirrels , of course , ca n't get any food from it , although they can get the ring off sometimes . There 's nothing else for them to get a grip on although they have tried , but apparently the word went out , because they do n't come around anymore . I 've got the ring on there pretty tight at this point . There are easy directions if you have to replace it or tighten it.The feeder is also guaranteed forever so if the ring gets lost for any reason , it will be replaced free . You do n't actually need the ring , as there are perches around the bottom with access to the seed openings and not using it even further deters squirrels , but my birds seem to like it . Even though the Grosbeaks are only in my area for a short time , they are so pretty , I 'm eager to provide an environment that attracts them.The large tube of this feeder makes it easier to fill than other tube feeders and it 's easy to hang high as it has a rigid hanger that allows you to hold it over your head to reattach on a tall pole . It is a durable feeder and popular with the birds because they can still feed in large numbers even when the feeder is almost empty since all the feedholes are around the bottom . A great squirrel proof feeder . Highly recommended .	1
First of all , this feeder does not come with a hook , so if you plan to hang it in a tree , like I did , you 'll need to order a metal extension hook unless you plan to mess with rope . I really like the hook I bought : Panacea 89017 Tree Branch Hook , Black , 36-Inch . The hook is almost the same length as the feeder , so they ship together nicely in the same Amazon box if you order them together . Within 48 hours of installing the feeder , I caught my 3 resident squirrels sliding down the hook from the tree onto the feeder and attempting to chew the seed holes on the feeder to access the seed . However , it was pure entertainment for me because 90 % of the time the squirrels can not maintain their balance on the tiny feeder roof and simply slip off 4 ' to the cushioned ground below ( below pine tree , so lots of soft dry needles ) . In snow , they simply can not hang on and slip right off . For a week the squirrels attempted to jump at the feeder or climb down the hook , and they finally seem to have given up and now simply feed off the fallen seed on the ground . I am delighted that so many bird species are using the feeding in the first 2 weeks : cardinals , house finches , mourning doves ( feed on seed on ground ) , woodpecker , titmouse , nut hatch , chickadee , etc . Recently , it poured and hailed/sleeted at all angles , so I decided to buy a large , clear plastic baffle to provide added coverage from the weather : Aspects 182 Super Dome . It was a steep $ 40 ( other reviews suggested a $ 8-10 one sold at most feed supply stores ) , but I wish I had bought it from day 1 because it would have kept the squirrels off the feeder completely . I like that it is clear and reviews said it lasts over time ( it is also made in the USA ) . I did examine the feeder after 3 weeks of use now and the squirrels managed to scratch and chew the feeder in certain spots , which can be completely eliminated by buying the aforementioned baffle . The squirrels now have no way to surpass the baffle . You could obviously probably buy any feeder and use the baffle to prevent squirrel access ... We have a lot of cardinals in our area , so I attached the cardinal ring from day 1 and extended all of the metal perches directly into the ring by twisting them at even intervals so that they full screw into every hole of the 'ring ' . Another review mentioned birds getting stuck if you do n't extend the perches fully into the ring . I find that the cardinals love the feeder , but they also like to just feed off the fallen seed 50 % of the time , as they appear to prefer ground feeding for ease of watching for predators ... The ring just gives the feeder a 360 degree perch , so most of the birds hop around the ring and explore the seed in each door . If they see me at the window and are shy , they also hop to a door of the feeder where they are more hidden.As for seed , I bought ( on Amazon ) the Kaytee Cardinal Blend , 7-Pound Bag and Kaytee Waste Free Nut and Fruit Blend , 5.5-Pound Bag . I created a large paper funnel with poster board I have , and scooped in 1 cup of one bag and 1 cup of the other bag to have even intervals of different seed . Even the chickadees and smaller birds love the larger nuts and seeds ( I do n't use any millet ) . They fly to the feeder and quickly grab 1 sunflower seed , then fly to a nearby pine street branch and peck away at it to break it open . Kaytee seemed to be one of the only seed brands that did n't have complaints from consumers about twigs and other waste . I do find it to be 100 % seed . I also occasionally mix in some of my organic breakfast cereal , such as granola with chia seeds , which they love as something different.My final thought is that given how quickly the squirrels tried to get to the feeder and seed , I ca n't imagine using any other feeder . The seed would surely be dumped in 1-2 days unless it were hung in a location where squirrels have no access . You really must buy this feeder if you plan to use the feeder in an area where you have squirrels . Other reviews stated that raccoons and deer can feed easily , so if you live in those areas , you might consider hanging it higher ... If you 're on a budget and ca n't afford this feeder , at least buy the baffle I recommend , which seems to be curved enough to prevent any squirrel from reaching any feeder you use below it.All in all , I spent almost $ 200 on the feeder , hook , clear baffle/dome , and quality nut/fruit/sunflower seed , but it was like a Disney movie today with over 15 birds and squirrels in my yard at the same time happily feeding at the feeder and on the ground.Other fun accessories to build your backyard avian habitat ( see my other reviews ) : -- > ceramic pedestal bird bath -- > wood blue bird houseUPDATE : Have had the feeder for about 3 months and have many regular birds ( many mated pairs ) that come daily at regular intervals:1 cardinal pair1 chickadee pair1 titmouse pair1 gold finch pair3-4 mourning dove pairs ( that feed below it and then sun themselves nearby ) 1 territorial catbird pair ( they chase away all other small birds when feeding ) 6 regular house sparrows and their chicks2-4 song sparrows2-4 red-headed house finches that travel together1 agile-flying nuthatcher ( swoops in , grabs a nut , flies off ) 1-2 grackles with a voracious appetite4 different woodpecker species ( Northern Flicker , Hairy Woodpecker , Red-bellied Woodpecker , Downy Woodpecker ) 1 occasional ground-feeding cowbird pair ( male with brown head ) 1 shy house wren pair ( they mostly look for insects in the vicinity , and only occasionally use the feeder ) 1 inquisitive blue jay ( does n't feed from feeder , but watches it , and feeds off ground nearby ) 3-5 squirrels that feed on the groundThey all recognize me when I glance out the window and throw them fruit and large nut pieces ... Also , the catbirds and grackles are VERY smart . They realized that if they both use the perch , the seed hatches are closed , so they only feed 1 at a time and get impatient while 1 feeds and the other waits nearby ! I have so many birds frequenting the feeder that the feed level drops 1-2 inches per day . I did adjust the tension level of the perch to have it close with less weight , but it was sad to see the birds fighting so much because when 3 sparrows or finches landed , the doors closed and they got aggressive . I also saw the heavier woodpecker really stressing over trying to pry a nut out with the doors 95 % closed ... I decided to just recalibrate it and allow full access for all birds ... it just means some will gorge and I 'll go through more seed ... .I find that some species tend to wildly peck at the seed to get to their favorite morsels , so the happy mourning doves wait below for the shower of seed that falls ...	1
This tubular feeds work exactly as advertised ; the seed doors shut whenever the weight on the perch gets too much , so as soon as a squirrel puts his weight on it or a large bird tries to land , they are denied food . The spring-loaded green base simply lowers over the holes . So far , squirrels have been discouraged , and they have n't managed to chew through the feeder as they did to a cedar and plastic one I once had.The top comes off easily with a twist . Filling can be a two-person job because it is n't easy to keep the tube upright if you need two hands to lift a large bag a seed . I suggest getting a bird seed scoop , especially since you 'll also have less spillage . The birds , including cardinals , actually seem to prefer this feeder over a nearby hopper-type one.UPDATE , with an LOL : Well , the squirrels have figured out that if they stick their paws inside the holes , they can keep the doors from shutting . As long as they do n't put their full weight on the feeder ( they use the nearby hopper feeder to plant their hind legs ) , they can get food out , bit by bit . I recommend keeping this feeder away from anything where they can balance and then stretch over to the tube. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
The best squirrel proof feeder out ! We purchase our first one in 2007 and recently the perches came loose and we lost them - a simple call and email to the company brought us a new set in just a few days . Great support ! Feeder is easy to load and easy to use and works great . When we lost the perches we purchased a new one and then got the parts for the old one - now we use two and they are wonderful - expensive but well built , last a long time and company stands behind them . Worth every penny !	1
As a Christmas gift to a friend , I am helping her feed the birds . She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure . We wanted to draw an assortment of birds , not just sparrows . This feeder is drawing tit mice , gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows . The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week . We are very pleased with it !	1
Okay , I like squirrels as much as the next person , but the greedy varmints that visit our yard just do n't know how to share . They would engorge themselves on our expensive `` patio mix '' birdseed until it was all gone.No amount of ingenious `` home remedies '' ( vaseline on the pole , etc . ) or expensive solutions ( baffles , umbrellas , etc . ) at our local birder 's store solved the problem.Not expecting miracles , I purchased the Squirrel Buster Plus at our local Orchard Supply Hardware store.And boy has it delivered . For years now , it has been our birds ' best friend . We 've been able to fine-tune the adjustment to attract the most variety of birds.It 's easy to clean , easy to fill , and it comes from Quebec ! ( So does my husband , so he likes that . ) I just called the company for help in determining what I did wrong , after the last cleaning , in trying to assemble . Turns out I had n't done anything wrong ; one part was simply worn out . ( We 've had it at least five years , and it takes a lot of hard , beating sun as well as periods of constant rain , etc . ) The rep offered to send a replacement part immediately . You ca n't beat that.Now , our only problem is what to do with all the paraphernalia and squirrel-friendly feeders we wasted out money on . Give to someone who does n't have squirrels , I guess.And yes , we do feed the squirrels . Separately .	1
I ca n't tell you how many bird feeders I have tried , and all went to the garage sale after this one came . Right away , the squirrel tried to get at it , but gave up . I loved it . The seed does n't spill out with the wind we have been having in the mountains of AZ . I used the cardinal ring with it so the bird have a nice place to land even though we do n't have cardinals around . It took my birds a little time to get used to this , but be patient , they will . Birds are creatures of habit like us . My other feeders is what they were used to , so they went there first . Now they are using this one more . It is well made , good engineering and I love the guarantee . The same day I got this one , the squirrel destroyed my finch feeder by pulling out the circle where the seed opening is . I lost all the finch seed , so I went and ordered Brome 's finch feeder . I have been relocating squirrels with my havaheart trap , as I had just too many , 16 squirrels have new homes now , but then a new obnoxious one showed up , so thanks Brome.Two years later : Wow they are just as good as the day I got them . Since the seed feeding part is at the bottom , you are not left with old moldy seed settling there . I removed the ring , to make it harder for the Jays to take over the feeder and it helped . This is still the best feeder out there , worth every penny and less waste of seed . I went I bought 2 more of them .	1
Pricey yes but you get what you pay for . This is my third feeder but this one is the best made bar none . It was already assembled but with very well written instructions on taking it apart and cleaning . It is VERY big/long and holds a ton of feed which is good and easy to fill . The top locks nicely too so critters can not get the feed . The cardinal ring is awesome and within 2 hours many cardinals learned how to feed on the unit . Other feeders no where near match this quality and design .	1
This feeder I do really like . It helps me fight my squirrel problem & # 34 ; but I do have some smart squirrels & # 34 ; a few have figured out ways to work around it but it is difficult and they do n't stay very long . So it does work and I like it.For any one who also has a raccoon problem you may want to try this one . I know you told me up front in your detail about this feeder it was squirrel proof not raccoon proof . But we were having a raccoon problem and this one he ca n't get off the pole and put on the ground or get the top off . But you must be sure to close the top securely and tight . I have two of these feeders now and the raccoon has stopped for now .	1
A bird feeder is an act of kindness from one species to another . For all the birds do for us , and for all that we have done to them , the least we can do for our feathered friends in our own yards is to buy them some food in the worst of seasons and difficulties . Our homes are often sitting on the very land where trees , bushes , maybe a stream and more once provided for these birds . So give back some of what has been taken by purchasing and maintaining a birdfeeder or 2 or 3.We have had this bird feeder for 6 years and its still going strong . It is very well made and designed . The birds love it , the squirrels not so much as they have long given up hanging on the feeder trying to get food directly . The squirrels have been demoralized by the ingenious design where their weight drops the spring loaded cam , closing off the food access ports . The squirrels , somewhat sadly , now wait on the ground below for spillage from the birds above.You could buy a cheaper birdfeeder , a mistake I have made several times over the years . Learn from the mistakes of others . Cheap feeders are not squirrel proof or resistant and wo n't last.Squirrels cause 2 problems with feeders . The first you might have guessed ; squirrels can eat so much seed as to double , triple , quadruple the cost of birdseed . Even a feeder for free , using so much seed would n't be a bargain ! But the 2nd issue which surprised me at the time , the squirrels will chew to pieces cheap feeders . Cheap feeders can look fantastic but the soft plastic parts such as the food reservoir made of flexible plastic can be hacked to pieces in minutes . So intent are squirrels that even my brome with a steel cap has intense chews marks on the edges , as the squirrels tried to chew their way to the food.A good bird feeder is an investment . It costs more but lasts a very long time and guaranteed , it saves money on seed , it keeps squirrels from becoming dependent on the feeder and their weight under control ( lol ) and is by far the better value by a very wide margin.Happily I can say Brome customer service is excellent . About a year ago the green perch ring broke as weathering caused this plastic part to brittle and snap . I sent an e-mail to Brome and they replied in a day , sending me a new ring free of charge by mail . On another occasion about 6 months ago , I took the feeder apart for cleaning and put it back together wrong . I called for service and they explained what I did wrong , a mistake probably nobody else would ever make -but as the Brome person explained the mistake , she mentioned I might have damaged the unit but not to worry , that they would replace the broken parts for free . As it turned out that was n't necessary.In a small but most important way , you can pay back some of the damage that has been done to our feathered friends saving many of their lives , and you can do this easily from your own back yard with just a bird feeder or two , or three . Keep your feeder ( s ) filled and clean as your birds will really depend on them , and when the weather warms add a Hummingbird feeder or two . In the Spring your wintering birds will raise the next generation , all the while returning your kindness as they fill the sky with flight , your trees with song , while being with you and your family all the days of your life . Do n't believe me ? Just open your door and take a look and listen right now . : - ) If you have kids consider making this their responsibility , a simple weekly chore and small life lesson on responsibility . I kind of think of it as one generation helping another , one species to another . `` Opie had been caring for wild baby birds that lost their mother , and remarked on setting them free that sadly the cage was empty . His father Andy quickly replied , `` Yes , son , it sure does . But do n't the trees seem nice and full . ''	1
This feeder was a bit expensive ( price has been dropping though ) , but when I opened the package I could see why , the build quality and design is excellent . Plus it 's very large . My previous feeder was a square plastic tube with a moving metal cage with fake `` leaves '' around it to stop the squirrels . It worked well enough for a year , but it had exposed springs and thin plastic , it was just a matter of time and the squirrels bent the metal leaves and ate through the plastic.The Brome is much heavier throughout , with a strong plastic tube joined up with metal and plastic parts . The mechanical spring adjuster is totally enclosed within the unit so it does n't rust and the squirrels cant get at it . It also comes apart easily for washing . The `` cardinal '' ring is an optional installation , other wise you set the perch length for the size bird you want to attract.So do birds like it ? yes very much , it will hold 3 or 4 finch at a time , or two larger birds.So has it stumped the squirrels ? yes they try sometimes , but are satisfied to hang out on the ground below . I did have an unknown predator skunk the feeder once when I had it installed too low to the ground . I suspect it was either Deer or raccoon that rocked it side to side dumping 1.5 lbs of seed out . I 've moved it higher now and have not had a repeat event.I suspect with care this feeder will last many years.June 2008 updateA year later and this feeder has held up very well . Squirrels have scratched the lid trying to open it but they still ca n't get to the feed . The top appears to aluminum because despite the scratches it has not rusted . I like how easy this feeder is to clean and the spring mechanism is very well protected so it 's still working like new . I continue to have deer problems with the unit , they appear to just lick the seed out of it , so I have to look to hang it much higher our of deer reach . I have cardinals , finch , woodpeckers , and lots of other great birds that love it.October 2008 updateI continued to have problems with deer getting at this feeder until I moved it to a much higher position . I now have it suspended from a wire between two trees so the bottom is about 8 ft off the ground . I no longer have any problems with ground animals getting to the feed and the feeder lasts for over a week without refilling . Squirrels try to climb down from the top , but they ca n't get to the feed and give up quickly .	1
I 've hung a variety of feeders in my yard over the years , and this has to be the best of the recent ones ! Once I got the hang of installing the perches and the ring ( they fell off during the first day - I had n't tightened the wing nut properly ) , birds have flocked to it throughout the day . Filled with a premium mix of black oil sunflower seeds , safflower seeds , dried fruits , tree nuts , peanuts , stripe sunflower seeds , and so many other delicious things I 'm tempted to grab a handful and snack , the feeder is home to titmice , nuthatches , cardinals , red-winged blackbirds , and chickadees.I find the shape absolutely delightful , and the deep pine green is very handsome . The seed capacity is larger than my 23 '' Droll Yankees . I did have to add a large `` S '' hook to my current iron bracket to accommodate the slightly smaller triangular hook at the top of the hanging rod on the feeder , but this makes filling and replacing it easier , too.The squirrels have absolutely given up on it , though it hangs on their favorite maple tree . The Squirrel Buster really works !	1
We have several feeders on our property and every one has been plagued with greedy squirrels that monopolize the feeder and keep the birds away while they wipe out the seed . We have tried putting seed on the ground for the squirrels , greasing the mounting poles , and we even tried putting one feeder on a Twirl-a-Squirrel , and none of these tactics have worked . My wife found the Brome Squirrel Buster Plus here on Amazon and we decided to get one and give it a fair try . It has proven to be a very good feeder that 's worth its weight in gold.This is a tube-style feeder that has six feeding ports on a spring-loaded , movable sleeve that slides down when sufficient weight is added . The idea is that the squirrel 's own weight works against it and causes the sleeve to slide down , cutting off all access to the seed when a squirrel tries to steal from the feeder . The sensitivity is adjustable so that the weight can be tuned to help discourage other pests such as grackles.The sleeve is made of metal which is important . If it were plastic , a squirrel would quickly be able to chew through it and eventually reach the seed inside.It 's not enough to simply rely on the sleeve to slide down . Squirrels are notoriously smart and would simply reach the ports by hanging upside down from the top of the feeder and helping themselves - except that this particular feeder is designed with a built-in baffle in the lid . It 's not a traditional baffle that wobbles and moves ; instead , the lid is shaped and painted such that there is no way to hang on to it while trying to reach down so squirrels simply fall off while trying.This is a well-constructed feeder that has a lot of thoughtful design features . As mentioned , the important parts ( the sleeve and feeding ports as well as the baffle lid ) are metal and are chew-resistant . The metal portions of this feeder have all been painted with what appears to be weather-resistant paint which will deter rust and corrosion ( and it makes the feeder harder for a squirrel to hold on to ) . There are adjustable perches for each feeding port as well as an installable cardinal perch ring.We watched one very determined squirrel try to get the seed from the feeder and after trying for a while it gave up and dropped to the ground without success . The squirrel was n't hurt , the feeder was n't damaged , and all the seed was still there for the birds . This is exactly the result we hoped for . We still end up filling it frequently , but now the birds get all the seed , not the squirrels.This is a large feeder and it holds a lot of seed.The Brome Squirrel Buster Plus feeder is exactly the feeder we had hoped for . It is very well constructed , it holds a lot of seed and it keeps the squirrels out of that seed without hurting the squirrels . It is a little on the expensive side , but it 's worth every penny and then some . With this feeder , you can get on to the business of feeding the birds without fattening up the squirrels in the process .	1
I bought this feeder after buying the mini model . I am well pleased with the mini . The 1024 is a large tube feeder with large perch easy to clean and fill.The birds like it too , good buy .	1
Pricey ? Yes , but well worth it ! ! I have purchased many bird feeders over the years ( including Duncraft ) but this feeder is the Rolls Royce in design , construction , durability and ease of use ( filling , hanging ) . Squirrels have eaten the last of my birdseed - this one will definitely keep them out - so ingenious ! I also purchased the weatherguard to protect the birds , as well as the seed , from the elements . I am sooooo impressed with this feeder - I hope the birds like it as much as I do ! ( ha-ha ) The weatherguard was a little tricky to install but if I can do it , anyone can ! Just follow the instructions that come with it .	1
I waited more than a year to write this review , because I really wanted to give this feeder a workout.I 've been feeding birds for more than 30 years now , so I have a pretty good idea of what works and what does n't , and this feeder does what it says it will . It 's completely squirrel-proof ! I 've had problems in the past , with squirrels decimating my feeders : emptying them out completely , chewing them up , and worst of all , keeping the birds away with their aggression.It 's great if you have problems with squirrels or even larger birds : you can adjust the closing of the feeder to accomodate the weight of your desired birds.Another plus is that it 's dishwasher-safe ! Having said all that , the only negative is that only so many birds can feed at a time if they 're sitting on the perch . But , for those birds that take a seed and then fly away to eat it ( chickadees , titmice , nuthatches , woodpeckers ) it 's great . If some birds are `` hogging '' the feeder , you can remove the perch altogether.Highly recommended ( I just wish it was less expensive ! )	1
I love Brome feeders . This is my third one . I like this one because it 's well made and the materials are good . The lid , base and cardinal perching ring are made of metal . This means the squirrels are less likely to damage it . The weight-activated shroud pulls down under the weight of a squirrel so the shroud covers the feeding ports . The shroud can be adjusted to keep larger birds out , too.Cardinals do not like to turn their heads to eat , so they do n't like feeders with stick perches . If you want cardinals at your feeder , you NEED the cardinal perch ring . ( Cardinals are also very timid/nervous . You 'll attract more cardinals if you place your feeder near shrubbery or evergreen trees . The tree or shrubbery is necessary because the cardinals want to sit in the shrubbery or evergreen tree , waiting and watching to make sure it 's safe to go to the feeder . Cardinals love hemlock trees , by the way . ) If cardinals do n't interest you , you can buy the same feeder WITHOUT the perch ring for a little less . It 's called `` Squirrel Buster Classic '' .I almost did n't buy this feeder because it 's so tall . I thought I 'd have to hang it extra high to keep squirrels from climbing or jumping onto it from below . Silly me . If squirrels attack from the ground or climb up the pole and grab the ring or shroud , the shroud will close the ports.If a squirrel gets on top of the feeder and stretches his front feet down toward the ports , he ca n't get to the seeds because the feeder is too tall for the squirrel to reach the ports ! Brilliant.Squirrels are unable to get the lid off , so they can not get to the seed from the top of the tube . The only way squirrels can get to the seed is to chew through the tube . I hope they 'll get frustrated enough to leave the feeder alone before they think of chewing through the tube.I ca n't speak to the durability of this feeder because I 've only had it for a week . But I can say that my other Brome feeders have held up very well . Excellent feeder .	1
Been watching squirrels trying to get at the food for weeks now ; none have successfully been able to get at the food . Plenty of room for lots of birds ; looks nice hanging from a tree in my back yard .	1
After just a few days of replacing our old bird feeder and food , we have many birds coming back to feed again ! I put this inSongbird and Cardinal Preferred Blend Bird Foodand the combination has been perfect . Our old bird feeder would collect the seeds at the bottom on a tray , which would get wet from rain and mold quickly . Because the seeds are housed inside the feeder , there was no mold to worry about . We have a lot of squirrels around , but they never seemed to bother our old feeder or this one . The pirch is great for the birds , but I suspect as soon as a squirrely tries to get into the seeds , he 'll be sadly disappointed that he ca n't get them.The picture on Amazon does n't do the size justice . I was able to get almost all of the bird food in the above link in the feeder . Great product , excellent design , and the birds and myself both love it ! Edit : After having this product up for a few months , I have noticed many birds at all times of the day waiting to feed . The squirrels have noticed it as well , but the seeds remain protected inside . After refilling the seeds , I forgot to screw the top green lid back onto the clear tube . The squirrels quickly figured out how to lift it up , and I found one head first in the feeder eating the seed . Ca n't fault the squirrel ... but make sure to give a nice quarter turn to make sure the lid is on tight.In addition to the cardinals , there have been some finches and other smaller birds that have showed up also . It is so nice to look outside and see wildlife enjoying a little food.Still a 5 star product , without question .	1
Stellar Jays and squirrels can not get into this feeder . Chipmunks ... are a bit light , so they still can get there if the pole is n't greased with baby oil , so still have to oil the pole , but the major feeders are not able to get much unless they are quick or clean up from what is dropped by the smaller birds . It 's well built and looks great .	1
I bought this feeder because we were having trouble with our old one as the squirrels were getting more food than the birds . I researched bird feeders for weeks and the only one I found that sounded like it would cure our squirrel problem was the Brome 1024 . I was really hesitant about paying so much for a bird feeder , but went ahead and made the investment . It has been worth the price in every way.Now after about three months of having the Squirrel Buster feeder mounted on a post in the back yard the thing is working just as advertised . The birds found it the first day I had it open for business and so far not a single squirrel has manged to steal seeds . I have the feeder setup on an 18 inch long hanger bracket so that helps discourage squirrel attacks , but if one of the furry critters ever did manage to jump onto the feeder itself the clever feeding port closing system would slam shut.The seed capacity of the Brome 1024 is huge and provides food for several weeks in our yard . So far we have had mostly Juncos and Black Capped Chickadees visit our feeder . The feeder is easy to fill and to clean . It is made of nicely finished metal mostly , with the seed hopper being heavy transparent plastic . This is a quality unit and will certainly last for years.I think this bird feeder is the best one on the market . You wo n't regret buying one . The birds will thank you . The squirrels wo n't .	1
Others do a better job of explaining various qualities of this feeder but as indicated by title - since the feeder ports are large amount of seeds fail out as the feeder closes on the squirrel . So yes the enemy is kept out , but I do lose a bit of seeds in the process . My best defense has been to put a squirrel feeder 30 feet away and to place a corn feeder when they 're being extra pesky .	1
Pricey but worth it since it 's good for life . The hardest part is setting the tension so cardinal can feed but not Jay Birds.I ca n't say enough about Brome bird feeders . It hold seed and I use sun flowers seeds and mix a some nuts and fruit with it and most all birds love it .	1
The feeder does just as the name suggests , busts squirrels ( mine have been very unhappy with me , they seem to be glaring at me from the trees ) .The feeder was easy to setup and seems to be well made . I just had to snap the perch ring together and figure out how to attach it ( instructions helped there ) . And put some seed in.I did have to change the sensitivity of my feeder . At the middle setting , it was too sensitive and would block the feeder when cardinals would land on it . I had a lot of finches and small birds , but the big birds could n't use it . So ... I 've adjusted it , the bigger birds can use it , though the squirrels still ca n't ( more glares ) .One thing I want to specifically call out is , how GREAT the instructions are . The instructions are clear , well written , with great images , and printed on nice paper that will endure ( that is a step up from 99 % of instructions almost any product delivers ) . The instructions go beyond the basic setup and configuration , and provide clear details on how to take the feeder apart and clean it . Explaining that a clean feed is important for healthy birds . Well done !	1
This is my second purchase of this feeder ; it most definitely prevents the squirrels from eating the bird seed ; birds seem to like the feeder , especially the finches ; Wild Birds Unlimited sells these feeders for a much higher price	1
My squirrel hangs upside down on the tree next to the feeder and eats upside down without touching the perch ring . So , YMMV . He seems very frustrated with the level of effort and does n't really eat at this feeder a lot.Also , I purchased this feeder in April 2013 , and it is now August 2013 . It is due for a cleaning . The crud solidifies after rainstorms and stops the lever mechanism from working.On a happy note , it takes apart very easily and with very little effort , even while cruddy . I did not put this in my dishwasher to clean ; I thought that was gross.I am not sure if the lever is working again after the taking apart , cleaning and reassembling , I will update my review if it does n't work , and on the Brome warranty for the item.Also , please note this feeder is HUGE ; it is almost 3 feet in length , so you will need a very sturdy branch to hang it on . It does not come with a hanger . It can not be mounted on a pole.All in all , though , four stars . I like that this feeder holds a whole bag of seed , so it needs to be filled every few days instead of every day or twice a day.Buy in confidence ! : )	1
Does exactly as described . No squirrels , just birds . Works so well that we now feel sorry for our squirrels . Would recommend .	1
Over the years , I 've tried many different types of feeders hoping to win my war of attrition with the super smart and athletic squirrels which populate the oak forest in which I live . The better ones were those with wire cages surrounding the small opening wire mesh which held the sunflower seeds . But even those were subject to nearly constant squirrel assault because those little critters could knock out a small number of seeds just by jumping on the feeder and reaching into the mesh . These feeders also limited the types of seed I could offer my fine feathered friends because they can not hold small seeds.But with this Brome Squirrel Buster PlusBrome 1024 Squirrel Buster Plus Wild Bird Feeder with Cardinal Perch Ringfeeder , I 've struck gold ! It has completely frustrated the army of squirrels . Within a day , they stopped trying to get to the seeds . Within a week I found I no longer had a zillion squirrels hanging around my deck . The amount of seed lost due to these critters has been reduced to nothing and my bird food lasts twice as long between refilling . Birds ( being birds ) still drop some seeds , so there 's still a few squirrels that hang around my neck of the woods , but the plague is over ! And I actually kinda ' like the little beggars ... in small numbers.The feeder is very well built , with many thoughtful design features . It 's easy to refill and clean . It can be adjusted to discourage larger birds such as scrub jays from dominating the feeder so that more song birds are present . And it 's easy to set up.It ai n't cheap , but in this case it 's well worth spending more for the very best . You wo n't be disappointed in this fine product !	1
I hung this feeder ~3 feet from the nearest object so squirrels would have to jump pretty far to get to it . I have had them still jump to other feeder i replaced , but this one is skinny enough for them to think again . The other birds can still get fed . I used to have to fill my feeders every day , but now I have had this feeder for a week and it still has about 4 '' of seed left . I Recommend hanging a feeder with fishing line ( spider wire ) . This allows you to hang it low so a squirrel cant get to it from the top .	1
It has been such a lot fun watching the squirrels go nuts trying to foil this . Not happening . I 'm saving a lot of money on bird seed , using this feeder .	1
I like this can . It gets a LOT of use AND a lot of compliments . When people ask where I got it because THEY want one , it is worth it just to see the shocked look when I say Amazon.com ! Great product . Great price . It works as expected !	1
I purchased this product in September 2008 based on my positivie experience with the B & D cordless weed trimmer . I have used it to trim a 20 foot Bottle Brush and a 10 foot bush . I was able to trim both of these bushes , cut down weeds and blackberry brairs , and then use the battery in my B & D weed trimmer before it died . B & D claims the pole hedge trimmer will cut up to 7/16 inch branches . That is was I got and found the cutting action good . You can lock the head into different positions to the pole : 180 , 90 degree , etc . You can use it for clearing ground growth , which is great . The rubber covering on the pole in front of the hand guard is very comfortable and makes handling the hedge trimmer easier . The disadvanges to this product are : 1 . It is heavy and the weight is at the end of the pole ( the cutting head ) . When you swing the pole to cut a bush the head it is going to want to keep moving . If you are on a ladder , you could lose your balance trying to stop it . My wife can not use it because of the weight . 2 . The pole does not telescope . It is about 6 feet from the handle to the end of the cutting bar , but if you need more reach than that , you have to have the arm length and strength to supply it . 3 . It only comes with one battery . Final thoughts , check the tension were the handle and the cutting head join . I notice mine did loosen during the job . Make sure your getting the best price . Prices vary across the internet and the various bricks and morter stores . Happy trimming .	1
I bought the NPT318 a week ago and I put it to the test this past weekend . The back of my parents yard is lined with Arborvitae 8-10 ' high and 4-5 ' wide . The cost of getting landscapers to trim them run $ 1500- $ 2000 . It 's a 2 day job . The last time I trimmed them I used an exta long electric hedge trimmer and a ladder . This year I used the B & D ; Pole Hedge Trimmer . Now the comments about the weight . The time I minded the weight a little was the second straight day I used it . Standing on the ground got most , but not all of the branches . On a few of the Arborvitae , I had to get on a ladder and extend across to get the tops . It seemed heavy at the time because I used the trimmer for at least 6 hr . straight the day before . But I liked the trimmer overall . It made it pretty darn easy to prune the sides and most of the top . There are a few suggestions made by others I read that I would suggest also for B & D. ; 1 . Increase the voltage . The hedge trimmer did stop when it got to the heavy branches2 . Have the motor on the bottom with just the blade on the top.Also I bought the B & D ; quick charger which came in handy . Having 2 batteries comes in handy . I had 3 batteries and worked the whole day keeping 2 batteries charging while using the other . I am glad I purchased it and I feel it was well worth the money.UPDATE : I recently went outside to trim some bushes . When I was in the process of trimming , the hedge trimmer just all of a sudden stopped working . I looked over the trimmer and nothing was in the blades . I called Black and Decker customer service . They told me to take it to the local B & D ; service place in my area . I took it there and they said it looked like a burned out motor . They promply replaced it with a new one in the box . That is great service . Thanks Black & Decker ; .	1
After reading the listing and reviews , I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that 's what I got . With that in mind and my expectations in check ... .this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge . The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall . You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not . It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it . What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions . This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase . As far as heavy ... 15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms .	1
I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy . I 'm not a big person . I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it 's actually faster to do the job . For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge . I do n't need to swing it back and forth . On the hedges ~4 ' tall I make two passes . Very quick . The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house . Then it becomes heavy . But , again I do n't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach . I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am .	1
I wish I had known about this product years ago ! I have a big driveway with a big eucalyptus tree over it that seems to drop leaves all year round ( I 'm in S. Cal ) . I 've been either sweeping or vacuuming constantly , and eucalyptus leaves have a way of `` sticking '' to the ground . This sweeper picks everything up effortlessly . I now have a clean driveway all the time , I almost hope for leaves just so I can push it around . Plus , my kids like to do it , too.Pros : -Effective at picking up otherwise hard to pick up leaves-Effective at picking up various debris-Not so hard to clean-Not so hard to push-Environmentally friendly-Good value for the price-Good exercise ! Cons : -Not good at sweeping up mounds of leaves and debris-Sticks and long pine needles get stuck in various parts ( not hard to remove , though ) -Leaves a thin line of fine dirt it ca n't pick up each time ( you can make a couple of passes to get it , though ) It does take some experimenting to figure out the best height and walking speed for the surface you are on , but once you figure it out , it works fine . Despite the product claims , do n't expect to pick up big objects or plow through big mounds of leaves or dirt and expect it work well . It is NOT a vacuum cleaner . At first , I was a little dismayed in that it feels too light , i.e. , a little cheap , but I got over it . I am also concerned how long the brushes will last , but I hope I can buy replacements.Overall , one of the best outdoor maintenance products I have bought in a long time . It makes it so much easier to always have a clean driveway and patio . Highly recommended .	1
I normally use a mulching blower/vac for the yards , but this sweeper is a quick and easy solution when I want to do a quick clean-up without hauling out a really long electric cord and the blower . Additionally my blower wo n't pick up cans , paper , and should n't pick up stones or mulch unless I want to break it.At 21 '' wide I use this like I would a mower except it does n't need a power source or gasoline . It can be used on the driveway , walkways , sidewalks , around the pool , on the porch -- -- -- -any place that has a hard , flat surface that is n't covered with dirt or sod or sand.I most frequently use this after the lawn is mowed or edged or when leaves pile up by the pool area . It replaces using a broom and is way easier . It contains a refuse receptacle that is easy to remove . Normally it is large enough to hold everything so it only needs to be emptied once , but sometimes when there is a lot of clippings , etc . I may need to empty it more frequently.The SpinSweep is compact when not in use . It folds up and I hang it it the gardening shed when not in use.If you need something to pick up yard waste around the paved areas of your home , this is a nice appliance to have as it is easy to maneuver and does a decent job quickly .	1
This item is an impoved version of a sweeper called Clean Boy . I paid over 200 bucks for one . This is basicly the same thing , but well impoved for way less than half the price . I use it for cleaning the driveway , around the pool and the curb . It works very well , just dont excpect it to do anything unreasonable . Stores easy also , you can hang it up by the handle and the main unit will go flat againts the wall . sorry my reviews arent the best.. but I can tell you this item was worth it ...	1
This is almost too good to be true . It is flimsy and simplistic but IT WORKS ! ! I have a huge paver patio courtyard ( about 2500 square feet ) and always found keeping it swept clean to be difficult and a drudgery at best . Thus it did n't get done very often . With this sweeper it is easy and much more thorough . Just before I discovered this on Amazon my wife and I had spent several hours sweeping with a broom and a shop vac and thought we had it clean . I got this two days later and went over part of it again just to try it out . To our surprise it picked up a lot that we had apparently missed ! I am still in the process of going over it all again and getting a lot but I have to believe after this first time thorough cleaning I will pick up less in the future if I use it with some regularity . Do n't expect some heavy duty high tech machine but I think you will be very pleased with the job it does .	1
I have used this pole saw 4times in the little time I have owned it and it has done everything expected and even more . I am no stranger to the B & D brand name and the products have always served me well . I have a gas chain saw which I use when my feet are on the ground but I never ever go up a tree or ladder with it but I do have need to cut limbs I can not reach so this battery operated pole saw takes care of that need and does it very well and the best part is the price . Very good product for the price .	1
This is the ideal device for light tree maintenance , making fast work of branches up to about 4-5 inches in diameter . It will zip through smaller branches in seconds and while it can cut through much bigger trunks it 's much slower than a gas-powered chainsaw for these pieces . Typically I get around 30 minutes of use on one full charge which takes between 6-9The product comes with a carry-bag and breaks down into three pole components , a battery and charger . It 's quick to assemble though do n't forget to put the battery in last to prevent any accidents . When fully assembled it 's not particularly heavy though can feel a little unwieldy and it takes some skill to cut the branches to avoid them collapsing on you.Apart from the low cost and typical Black & Decker quality , I particularly like this over a regular chainsaw for safety reasons . It 's much , much safer to stand on the ground with a chainsaw on a pole than climbing on ladders trying to get into trees with a traditional chainsaw . It 's also better for avoiding bugs and debris.The unit needs very little maintenance other than occasional chain tightening ( wrench included ) and I lightly oil the chain each time before use . The instructions explain the details but it 's very simple . Overall , I could n't be happier with this tool and while it 's not going to take down entire trees it does make trimming and pruning a breeze .	1
18 months ago I was up on an 8 ' ladder trimming branches . The ladder legs bent , I fell 5 ' to the ground . I wo n't go into the details but I 'm still recovering from the fall . The old ladder is in the garbage dump and I have a new , stronger , ladder . But I still do n't want to go up a ladder unless I really have to.I bought this pole chain saw to augment the four 18V Black & Decker tools I already have , and to reduce the number of times I must climb a ladder . I assembled it in two minutes , was able to trim branches from the ground . It worked easily , cut easily , and disassembled easily for storage in the bag provided.I really like these 18V tools from B & D . ; I also have a B & D ; 36V lawn mower . No more gas , no more electric cords , no more spark plugs , and no more oil . I can mow & edge two lawns , and blow off the sidewalks and driveway in 20 minutes.I think this is a great addition to my B & D ; collection.By the way I 've been using the B & D ; tools for two years . I keep all the batteries on the charger 100 % of the time when they are not in use . I have n't had to replace a battery yet , and they all seem to hold a charge as well as they did when new .	1
I had a sears reciprocating blade pole saw , that cut very nice and clean , but broke after 10 minutes of use ( I tried 2 before returning it for my money back ) . This B & D ; unit does n't have a blade , it has a mini chainsaw on the end and man can it cut . I was amazed how it chews through branches 5+ inches thick . It seems to be pretty good quality and even though some plastic , it is holding up well.Pro's-amazing cuts from the ground without climbing the tree-very aggressive cut rate-fairly light-pretty easy to use , very easy to use without extra extension-powerful battery-blade cover and attached oil bottle is convenient-gets branches that you would otherwise have to call the tree man to doCon's-this is a real chainsaw so do n't be fooled into thinking it 's a toy , keep kids away too-safety is a concern ; safety glasses , heavy gloves , and a hard hat are good idea-the lower the branch the easier to cut , high branches end up right over your head and there is risk of them falling on you-it 's hard to undercut the branch before top cutting to prevent tear out-it leaves a rough cut like a chainsaw , not smooth like a tree pruner-battery life is good , but it comes with just one so you can easily find yourself stuck in mid cut . A second battery is highly recommended.-included charger is a slow charger ; 6 hours if completely dead . B & D ; makes a fast charger for 25 bucks.I find this tool very handy . I purchased a B & D ; 18V broom ( $ 70 ) just to get 2 extra batteries and another charger .	1
I used this product around my home and it does everything everyone else said it would do . The only thing I was n't sure of was the weight of the unit and holding the product for about 45 minutes to an hour with the maximum length of 14 ' , but I got used to it . I believe the amount of time for the battery is about 45 '' to 1 hour which was great and meant I could stop after that time . Works out perfectly for us older guys .	1
Having used mine for a couple months , I have to say this is a great tool for basic tree trimming . No , you are not going to take a tree to the ground with this , but for keeping your landscape looking good or fixing winter and storm damage , this is a great tool.First thing you will want to do is buy that Firestorm 18volt battery up above . It lasts longer and has much more power than the one that comes with this tool . Also keep in mind that dead wood takes more out of the battery than green wood as does cutting bigger branches as the saw is running constantly as opposed to off and on with cutting small branches , so your battery mileage may vary.Second , the saw comes with a hex/screwdriver to keep the chain tight and to remove the bar for cleaning and a little bottle for Bar & Chain oil . Use them ! Keeping the saw clean , chain tight and lubricated is the most important part of keeping this tool running . Oil early and often.Third a safety warning ! The safety switch is also the trigger locking switch and when you are using this saw at it full length it can be a little dangerous . When you saw thru the branch and it and the saw drops , the trigger lock may keep the saw running on you.Also , if the chain slips and the saw stops because it is jammed , remember to release the trigger lock ! The electric motor can burn out because it is still on till the lock is released ! As to fixing the jam , just unscrew the hex bolts , clean out any debris and reset the bar & chain , remembering to readjust the screw that tightens the chain.I am very pleased with my saw and I am looking forward to getting more 18volt tools in this line .	1
I 've had my B & D Pole Pruning Saw for 1 week now . I bought this based solely on comments made on this site by people in the review . They did not disappoint . This is a nice product . I 've used it 3 times now and it cut though all branches smoothly . It is lightweight and very well made . Before I bought this I used the Woodzig Pole saw . That is not in the same league . The B & D is far superior . I think you will be very satisfied as I am with this product .	1
Worked great on branches up to about 4 inches . Seemed kind of flimsy at connections but otherwise I like this item	1
This chain saw is not for huge jobs , but for cleaning out roots from beds or for sprucing up a tree which has become a bit over grown between seasons , this saw does the job . Caveat : get another battery and charger if you are really going to town on trimming branches then you wo n't have to wait a few hours for the 1st battery to recharge to finish your project .	1
Arrived on time with good packaging . Battery charged quickly . Went to work on some branches that were too high to hang off a ladder for . Cut right through them . Can get heavy when used overhead for more than 10 minutes . If you plan your work load , and mix sizes and locations of the items to be cut , you wo n't fatigue your arms . Your arms will usually give out before the battery does . Ca n't stress enough to keep the chain oiled .	1
When presented with a $ 750 estimate to trim trees and bushes in my yard , I decided to buy a pole saw and do it myself . I bought the Black and Decker cordless and am very satisfied with its performance . I have used it on oak limbs up to 5 '' , holly up to 6 '' , pear up to 4 '' and ligustrum up to 4 '' . It has had absolutely no problem with any of these limbs . You do need to plan your project ; i.e. , saw a bit , pick up , saw again , etc . ; otherwise , the battery will run down . The batteries seem good for only 30-45 minutes continuous duty ; it 's really necessary to have a spare . Another reason to break your work up is muscle fatigue . Although a light tool , its length ( especially at full extension ) will cause you to discover muscles you had forgotten you possessed , and I visit the gym 2-3 times weekly to lift weights . Again , this is a perfect tool for the home gardener ; however , I do not recommend it for heavy duty professional work . Make sure you read and follow the instructions .	1
QUICK SUMMARY : This is the 2nd time I 've bought this pole saw . My first one broke after two years of use , but it was useful enough to me that I was willing to buy it a 2nd time . Read my review to learn what NOT to do . Recommended ! My first Black and Decker pole saw broke when the screwhole threads inside the metal frame ( these are the screwholes you use to make the chain taut ) somehow got stripped after I tried tightening the screws once . Apparently , you have to be CAREFUL not to overtighten these screws , or else you 'll damage the screwhole threads , and the screws meant for tightening the chain wo n't tighten anymore , so your chain becomes too loose to use , so you ca n't use it anymore . My lesson learned is your lesson learned ! I also should admit , too , that I pushed this pole saw beyond its intended means . By that , I mean that I was cutting big limbs off my front yard 's black olive tree , the largest of which was probably about 10 '' in diameter . Yes , it 's really intended to be used to cut much smaller branches and limbs , but I had to cut big limbs off my tree before hurricane season ! What I like : - it 's reasonably lightweight , though hard to use when you 're stretching on a step ladder- no electric wires to accidentally cut , or that unplug from your saw ! - the battery keeps a reasonably long charge- the chain is easy to tighten and replace- it 's relatively inexpensiveWhat I do n't like : - you have to manually oil the change every so often- you can overtighten the screws bringing permanent damage to your saw if you 're not careful ! - you have to assemble the wand fully to use the saw ; I wish you could just plug-in the battery directly or almost directly into the saw so you more easily cut-up the fallen branches into smaller piecesFinal tip : Take the time to read the manufacturer 's advice on how to properly store and care for your battery . I did n't , and my older saw 's battery suffered because I did n't follow the charging instructions correctly.Recommended !	1
I have a non-heavy-duty version of this hose , which has worked well for me for a year or so now , and I wanted another NeverKink , because these hoses seem to be flexible and easy to coil by hand , yet able to keep water flowing.This hose is quite a bit more rigid/inflexible than standard garden hoses and other NeverKink hoses , which makes winding the hose onto a hanger a little more difficult , and handling the hose a little more difficult in general . The hose does seem like it will stand up to a lot of use , though.My only major gripe is that the female end of the hose seems to have developed a leak already , after only a few weeks ' use , seemingly at the point where the hose is crimped onto the brass fitting . I 'll probably buy a replacement female connection from the home center and put it on .	1
Does n't kink and excellent build quality . Just make sure to run water through the hose before watering your plants because I notice some white residue within the inside probably from manufacturing . It came out while I was filling a bucket of water . No big deal just a heads up in case there are sensitive plants .	1
Sure , this kinks a lot less easily than a rubber hose , but NEVER SAY NEVER ! ! ! It 's a decent hose with nice HD brass ends , but it WILL kink . Keep in mind if you 're using a hose in colder weather , rubber is the only way to go . These vinyl hoses STINK in the cold and have a memory of how they 're stored . They 're awesome in warmer climates though ! Overall we 're happy with the hose , but believe it should n't claim that it 'll & # 34 ; Never Kink & # 34 ; .	1
This holds up really well , an does n't kink.It is not drinking water safe , and has a very strong plastic smell when first used . It does the job I intended it to do .	1
This is a heavy-weight hose and heavy-duty . I already had purchased the 100foot one for my backyard and like it very much . It does n't kink and it seems to be well made enough to last a few years before I 'll need to replace it . This one is made with the same quality . It does n't kink and it appears well made enough to last . I put it in my front yard where it gets regular use and it is doing what it is supposed to do , so I have no issues with it . In fact , if you are looking for a heavy duty hose that wo n't kink and will stand up to regular use , I have no problem recommending this one . In fact , as time goes by I 'll probably be purchasing another one for my side yard , just have n't decided what size to get yet . It is a bit pricey , but I think it is worth it . It is made out of recycled materials and you ca n't drink from it , but that is to be expected now a days . Again , it is a heavy hose , so I would n't recommended it to those that are frail , arthritic or weak . Moving it around will wear you out . Other than that , it stretches out easily ; you do n't have to fight with it.Tip : uncoil it and lay it where you want before turning the water on . If you leave it coiled up , then turn the water on and try to move it about it will be like moving an iron pipe . It becomes rigid when the water flows through it .	1
Great little hose to water my plants and drink from . It does leak a bit . I do like the easy connector . I just wish it did not leak so much . A handy little hose for just about anything . Also , it is fairly priced and no problems with kinking .	1
I needed a 75 ' version so I added this 25 ' size to my 50 ' hose of this same type . It is lightweight and easy to deal with . In fact , it 's so much more maneuverable , I 'm really surprised . We 've had some hot weather these last few days so I 've already had to water considerably and this hose has made the chore much less awkward . I also like the fact that I can spray the vegetable garden and not worry about toxic stuff from the hose material mixing with the water and affecting my crop . I 've replaced all my hoses with this type and am very pleased with them .	1
There is little more annoying than a kinked hose , especially when watering vegetables . This hose solved that problem for me !	1
This is the 2nd roll I 've purchased , so that should tell you how much I like it . I got a 50 ' roll first , and liked it enough to buy another 25 ' roll so I would have enough and some extra to cover all my yard.This is the first hose I 've used/owned that you did n't have to be super careful not to kink . It always seemed like the higher end the hose was , the softer it was , and the more it would kink on me . I can just roll/unroll this hose when I need it , and no issues so far . Highly recommended .	1
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OTHER HOSES THE BEST ONLY THING IT HAS FUNNY CONNECTORS IF YOU USE REEL LOOK CLOSELY I CAN JUST GET IT THROUGH MY MODEL SUNCAST	1
For years I fought with a 75 foot hose that leaked at the couplings , kinked and resisted being rolled up . This hose did n't do any of those irritating things and I was not soaking wet by the time I finished using it . It rolled up very nicely on my hose reel . I 'm pleased with this purchase .	1
Years ago I bought a commercial grade 5/8 '' rubber hose to fit on my hose reel . This hose has been a pain to use , as it 's heavy & is constantly kinking . My search for a lightweight kink resistant hose found this.The pros : + The shipping was free when I purchased mine.+ Drinking water safe.+ Nice clean white color with a blue stripe.+ Light weight.+ Resists kinking.+ Easy to rewind on my hose reel.The cons : - On the expensive side for 1/2 '' x 50 ' hose.- The hose has a funky plastic piece molded on to the female fitting . I 'm sure it 's to increase the ease of use , but I find it annoying . I 'd be happier with the plain old brass only fitting & I may opt to cut it off.Overall , I 'm happy with this hose . It much lighter than the old commercial grade rubber hose I was using + it does n't kink ! : ) & # 9658 ; Update - May 27 , 2014I decided to cut off that piece of plastic on the female fitting . Under that plastic was the standard brass fitting . : )	1
The one thing I 've always hated about gardening is hoses -- until I found this one . When I opened the hose the first time , I was able to uncoil it easily and then hang it on a holder with much less hassle than my other hoses . It 's lightweight and easy to handle . I 'm so pleased with it , I 'm replacing all my hoses with this type . Although we do n't usually drink out of the hose , I do fill my dog 's water bucket and with my current hose , I have to let it run for several minutes because of the milky , soapy water that comes out at first . That ca n't possibly be good for the dog or anything else . That does n't happen with this hose . I get clear water immediately.This hose is white with a blue stripe , which is great for a boat or RV , but a little glaring in the yard . Still it 's so much easier to use I can live with that . I have to move one of my hoses several times in dry weather to hook to different soaker hoses and some things need to be hand watered , so weight and manageability are really important to me and this hose scores a 10 .	1
I have a need for many hoses on my property , and it am always testing out new hose ideas.All my hoses are never kink , but in reality , after a few months or a year they do kind a bit . You may not think that is a big deal , but if you have as much waiting to do as I do daily , you would & # 34 ; get & # 34 ; it.I also like that it light weight . The color is nice also and the price reasonable .	1
Very light and easy to use , we replaced our heavy garden hose for this one . Also , good to know it is safe to use when washing my dog .	1
This hose is goood so far . I leave the hose in my lawn and there has n't been any damage or kinks . Defintiely recommend this product .	1
Over the years , I have bought and thrown away hundreds of dollars of hoses that were `` commercial '' , `` professional '' , `` industrial-strength '' , `` kink-proof '' , `` life-time guaranteed '' .Nearly 1 year ago , I bought 3 of these and this hose is the best I 've ever used.Unlike every other hose , this Apex hose does n't have the dreaded coiled memory effect which makes it so difficult to coil up.While these hoses are not truly kink-proof , they 're very kink-resistant.Even though they 're 1/2 '' , the flow rate is surprisingly good and I 'm using 2 of them together.Since they 're not heavy , it 's easy to hang up . My other hoses were so difficult to hang , I simply left them on the driveway which made the place look sloppy . These are so easy to hang , my wife hangs them each time.I used to loathe the prospect of dragging out 100 ft of heavy hoses to water the garden that I would neglect watering and plants died.You 'll love this hose .	1
This hose is just as described . Very nice and light . I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage , I did n't need to use any except the one it has . It does not leak at all , and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants . I was considering purchasing the & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; green ones that expand to double or more their size , but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative . This is it for me ! Light , but very nicely made .	1
I recommend this Hori Hori knife to other gardeners every chance I get.After I started using my Hori Hori I loved it so much I never went outside into the yard without it on my belt.Every few steps I take it comes in handy . I love rearranging the plants and i 'm always weeding . Now I just whip out the Hori Hori and dig up a plant , then use the knife to dig the new hole to replant . I 'm always using it to remove weeds . I use it to cut the roots off the celery and lettuce before I bring them into the house . I use it to harvest vegetable from the stems.Honestly I 'm sure i 've never had a gardening tool this useful . I bought one for my mother . I 'm planning to buy another for a friend at church . It 's the perfect gift.This model is very sturdy and easy to keep clean . I keep this knife cleaner than I keep my car . It 's the first time i 've ever paid so much attention to keeping track of my tools . The rest of them are scattered around the property until they get tripped over.I have not yet sharpened the blade . I think that might be a chore but it will need to be done at some point . I 've used mine for a few months now and i 'm assuming at the end of this season it 'll need sharpening .	1
This is an excellent digging tool . I have one other with a matte blade which I have used for years . This knife has depth markers incised into the shiny stainless steel blade which help with determining the depth to dig for various bulbs and corms . It also has one jagged blade which helps when you have to cut a root .	1
This product is very obvious in its high quality . I do n't understand why a quality product like this does n't come in a genuine leather pouch , because anyone would pay the extra money for a pouch that will last as long as the knife .	1
I looked at all the Hori-Horis available on Amazon and read all the reviews before settling on this one as a present for my girlfriend , an avid gardener . She was impressed by the quality , and likes how it can be used as a shallow trowel , a bulb planter , a perennial divider , a root cutter , and more . It 's very handy in her garden , which borders on a nature preserve full of invasive plants . It 's attractive and well made , too . I 'd recommend it for any outdoor gardener .	1
I bought this last year so this is the first spring I have had to use it . I am seriously impressed . I am using it for popping out weeds , hacking down dead vegetation and planting . It does n't dig a wide hole and does not work as well as a trowel for removing dirt while planting , but it works much better than a trowel to plant in my horribly rocky clay areas and the blade makes it easy to puncture a hole to put the plant tag.The sharpness of this is tool makes it extremely useful . I think the serrated blade will make sharpening difficult , but for this price it is well worth getting a new one when it gets dull . I will definitely do so and am buying some for gifts for my fellow gardening friends.Also , if you wonder what the difference between the models 1515 and 1516 , according to the company 's web site this one is a stainless version of the black 1515 .	1
This is one of the greatest garden tools I have ever owned . Since buying one for myself , I have given a couple to others as gifts , and bought a second one for me - as I tend to put things down and sometimes forget where . With 2 , I keep one in the pocket of my lawn tractor seat cover - and therefore always know where at least one of them is ! ! !	1
This thing is huge ! I use it with my lump charcoal in my 22.5 weber performer grill . One scoop will basically fill one of the weber charcoal briquette baskets ( which i use with my lump charcoal ) . This was 100 % easier and faster than picking up a couple of pieces at a time with my tongs.UPDATE : I just bought a 2nd one for my dog 's food as well and it works great . Definitely multi-purpose tool .	1
What can I say , this is a top quality cast aluminum scoop that is great for scooping charcoal out of the bag and into the chimney . This thing seems indestructible .	1
I own this scoop , use it for putting lump charcoal in and taking ash out of myWeber 721001 Smokey Mountain Cooker 18.5-Inch SmokerWorks great , perfect size , constructed to last forever , aluminum so it wo n't rust . I also use it on myWeber 1421001 Performer Charcoal Grill , BlackI keep my lump in the side bin , and store the scooper with it ! Amazon is ( always ) the greatest place to shop !	1
I love to barbeque even in the winter but hate getting the black smutty charcoal dust all over my hands while prepping the grill . I have seen plastic scoops that do n't hold up or are too small but this one is perfect . It 's aluminum so it wo n't rust and is weather tough . It 's heavy gauge so it wo n't bend while serving hefty helping of coals to the grill , and it 's stylish and affordable . Who could ask for more ?	1
This is a fine little scoop . I use mine for scooping charcoal into my chimney starter , and it 's big enough , strong enough , good enough , and darn it , people like it . While I would n't go quite so far as one reviewer in saying that it looks like a $ 100 item from a specialty store ( wish I owned a specialty store in his/her neighborhood lol ) , it does look well made , the finish is decent , and it is sturdy enough to lift a lot more of whatever you 're lifting than will fit into the scoop.That 's the scoop as I see it , hope some of you find my review helpful !	1
I also did n't expect it to be so big , despite some reviewers mentioning the size . I bought it to scoop rock salt out the salt bag and I 'm impressed by how much it holds . The quality and attractiveness of this product is actually overkill for this use , but that 's okay because it 's nice to be surprised in a positive way .	1
I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie 's dish . After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break , I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog , does it work so much better than a bowl ! ! It 's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years . I did n't measure how much , but the scoop holds a lot , and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop ? It 's strong , has a nice finish to it , it 's easy to use , and holds a lot . In fact it 's so nice , I 'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he does n't scarf it to use for the charcoal .	1
I 've always felt it 's probably a little unsanitary to use an aluminum beer can with inked labeling on a hot grill . Maybe not , but it gives me pause . This device works as a more stable and possibly more healthy alternative to a can of Bud . It is also perfect if you want to use other liquids such as wine , juice or whatever . The only downside is the clean-up . It consists of four parts , each of which get coated with chicken drippings and need some serious scrubbing to get off the cooked-on residue . I 've found a dishwasher alone does n't really remove all of it . A little scrubbing is necessary to really get the device clean.This is certainly a useful item for us backyard cooks . It 's a little inconvenient compared to using a beer can that can be tossed in the trash after using .	1
With or without the beer this device puts the bird in the best position for grilling . We use beer , soda and fruit juice . If there is an issue with this unit it would be lifting the unit off the grill with the bird in place . Handles are to close to grid to get a grip without burring yourself . I use a couple of heavy forks to lift off of grill - easy work around .	1
this works great wish the tray was a little bigger & deeper but still gets the job done like that its stainless steel worth the money .	1
I picked this vertical roaster for multiple reasons . Like many other reviewers , I made a few beer-butt chickens that decided they would rather fall over and make a mess as opposed to stand up straight and tall and cook like a well-behaved poultry . Secondly , I own a couple of cookbooks buy Steven and when I saw that he endorsed this product , I took a leap of faith that he did n't back up a piece of junk.He did not.This is a small , but well made and solid piece that works great on my Weber One-Touch Silver charcoal grill . I usually roast 4 lbs . birds , and they fit on the apparatus snugly and securely . I have NOT used the included cup/infuser , only cans of cheaply priced domestic beers . The results have been great . I like to put a little onion or potato in the chicken 's neck to help seal in the moisture , but that 's me.The unit is stainless steel , and dishwasher safe and it cleans up nicely . The 12oz . beer cans fit securely in the ring , and it seems like a lot of thought went into the design accept in a couple of areas , which I 'll get to in the next paragraph . The handles are secure enough where you can hold the whole thing chicken and all by one handle and not worry about it breaking or bending.The only cons that I have found are that the drip pan could stand to be a tad deeper and I wished the handles angles upwards a bit more because its tough to fit a gloved or mitted hand between the hot grill grate and the underside of the handle to lift the unit off the grill when its done.Other than that , job well done and I really recommend it ! The additional separate can/infuser enhances the versatility of the device so you can flavor the bird with wine , OJ , sake , sodas , or broths . That 's pretty cool.Happy grilling and enjoy your chicken-on-a-throne !	1
This has to be the best chicken rack out there . It 's easy to use , easy to clean , and pretty to boot . I gave this to my husband with the cookbook , **Beer-Can Chicken : And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** ( http : //www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264 ) and it 's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since . You CAN NOT make chicken this good in the kitchen -- it 's better than any rotisserie , better than any baked chicken -- ever -- . You 've got to try this -- you wo n't be sorry !	1
The Good : These skewers are perfect , much better than traditional round ones and infinitely better than wooden ones . For everyone who has ever had the frustration of trying to turn your food on the grill only to have the skewer turn inside the food and the food stay stuck to the grill , these wide rectangular skewers are perfect . They are very long and very durable as well . I have cooked numerous meals with them to include beef , vegetables and chicken . Every one came out perfect and I never had a problem with the skewer sliding around inside the food itself.The Bad : Even though these are stainless steel , after cooking with them and washing them off they rusted . I quickly solved this problem with a Brillo pad and before I put the skewers away in the drawer , I coated them with a very light coat of olive oil . Problem solved .	1
After chasing food around the typical round metal & wood skewers for quite a while I decided to go on the hunt for a better skewer , and I found them ! The `` flat vs round '' design allows whatever food you have on them to stay in place so that everything cooks evenly . The point , although sharp is not overly so but still sharp enough to easily pierce raw meat and the 18 '' length gives you plenty of room to `` load em '' down with goodies or space the food out whichever suits the food being grilled . The loop handle makes it easier to grasp the skewers with a mit or tongs.A previous reviewer mentioned the 18 '' length and I 'll agree depending upon your grill this length may be a bit long and they may be a tad better 2 '' shorter [ that reviewer just cut his to fit ] .I gave these skewers 5 stars as I do n't anticipate having to find anything better for kabobs !	1
I must not have been paying attention when I bought these , because I can clearly see it now - but they are thick ! They work great , but you have to cut some good sized vegetable slices and be careful when putting them on the skewer or they will crack and slip off . But if you do it right they make some great kabobs on the grill !	1
These are perfect kabob skewers . Very sturdy , sharp point to get through food , wide flat edge so the food does n't spin around when you are flipping them as it invariably does with round skewers . More expensive than bamboo skewers but unless you lose these , they should last forever . Pay attention to the measurements as these bad boys are long . I have a WSM 22.5 inch and 22 inch Performer and these fit but not on my 18 One Touch Silver or the little Smokey Joe . If you have a small grill these may not work . Otherwise , they are perfect .	1
Nicely constructed skewers . They do n't roll . They are not too wide and hold the food well . So what else could you want ?	1
Anyone who has had to struggle with a large , hot , slippery piece of meat can appreciate these . We use them with our smoker to move meat around and put it on plates . Works fantastic for what we need . Also really easy to just wash while still wearing them just under the faucet . They are a little big and stiff but not too clumsy for what we use them for .	1
I picked these because when I 'm smoking meat I want to grab the meat instead of sticking it with a pitch fork or something . Half the time it 's too tender anyways and it wants to fall apart . These gloves make it easy to transport the meat from the grill to the pan .	1
I HAVE USED THESE SEVERAL TIMES SINCE RECEIVING . THEY WORK GREAT I PULLED MEAT RIGHT OFF THE GRILL WITHOUT FEELING ANY HEAT , THEY ALSO PROVIDE A REALLY GOOD GRIP ON THE FOOD . MY HANDS ARE VERY LARGE SO THEY COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BIGGER BUT FOR 99 % OF FOLKS THEY WILL FIT FINE .	1
I do n't know if they will make your hands sweaty when they are used but they will stop my hands from getting burnrd	1
I 've been BBQ'ing for many years now and am sorry to say it took me way too long and too many burned fingers to invest in a good pair insulated & # 34 ; Q'ing & # 34 ; gloves . They are large but as I only use them to pull items from my smoker I do n't mind that they are a bit big . Are easy to clean when you wash your hands with the gloves on . Good investment if you BBQ or Smoke a lot .	1
I received a kamado-style grill this past Christmas and just like anyone would who gets a new gift/hobby , you invest in it . As part of my investment , I realized I would need some insulated food gloves if I really wanted to cook on my new grill ( especially if I smoke large meats like turkeys , briskets , and ribs ) .Even before I got the grill , I knew I would need them for future purposes because this past Thanksgiving , I baked my very first turkey and while carving it , I realized that I had no insulated gloves specific to handling hot meats ( especially when I carved it . ) At first I thought about oven mitts , which does allow you to handle the meat without burning your hands but I realized it would n't be very sanitary considering all the gunk that gets on cooking mitts . The only other gloves I had were these latex gloves that you get out of the `` cleaning '' section of your grocery store . While it keeps your hands clean , you still 1 ) burn yourself and 2 ) do n't really know if it 's `` safe '' for handling food.So after shopping around and finding recommendations from several BBQ forums , I decided on these gloves . While other reviewers say you can get `` better '' , I ended up buying these and find they were worth it for the following reasons:1 ) These are affordable compared to other barbecue gloves on Amazon . The $ 14.23 price point ( as of December 2012 ) makes it very competitive.2 ) Is actually designed to handle hot food and is insulated so it wo n't burn you.3 ) The outside material is `` rubber-like '' and is designed to handle food . What this means to the buyer is that 1 ) it 's safe to handle your food and 2 ) the rubber outside coating means it 's WASHABLE . The majority of the gloves on Amazon were made of some type of porous cloth . Anyone who has ever had oil/juices/grease/food touch cloth knows it can get extra dirty over time if you do n't wash them.4 ) I know these gloves are n't `` GRILL '' gloves , but I 've also used them as such ( meaning I 've touched the grates on my grill/smoker with these and it did n't seem to damage them ) . There is a disclaimer though , that says it 's not designed for temps beyond a certain temperature ( ca n't remember what ) , so if you 're doing high-heat cooking , I 'd advise you not to handle things that are beyond that temperature . It 's listed on the box.Overall , very happy with these as I 've already used them a few times with my smoked turkeys . My next cooking project is pulled pork !	1
These worked great for handling hot meat . We also used them to adjust the hot racks in our smoker . This partially melted the gloves so maybe that was n't a smart idea . Still useable , but a little rough and melty looking on the finger tips.Find it difficult to wash inside and out . Some reviewers washed as if you were washing your hands but I require more disinfecting than that . I would first wash while wearing them , then soak them , and even ran it through the dishwasher . The melty fingers definately made it more difficult to clean . Overall not that hard , just stating its not a wiz bang situation ( and lord help you if you get the inside dirty )	1
great for using to adjust or remove meat from the grill and smoker	1
If you smoke meat , these gloves are a must . They are food grade and insulated.Allows you to handle the meat in the smoker without using tongs or heaven forbid , forks ( bad word ) .Always put a cuff at the bottom , unless you like the feeling of meat juice running down your arms.Easily cleaned , mild soap and water.A little stiff due to the thickness of the coating and insulation , but nothing to complain about.I store mine in a gallon baggie . Note : Fold gloves and put a paper towel over the outside of the glovesbefore trying to put them in the bag . Try it without the paper towel and you will quickly know what I mean .	1
If you smoke or BBQ then you need a pair . Pulling meat or trying to grab heave meat off a smoker would be tough without a pair . Just wash your hands in the sink with them on to clean . Great gloves an a must have next to the smoker .	1
I 'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker . Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can `` feel '' the product I am working with . While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils , hot lids , water pans , charcoals , wood , etc . If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though , or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling , pulling , etc , these are what I use . They can be cleaned easily by putting them on , soaping them up , and washing your hands under the faucet . They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us .	1
Great interior , temperature protection , and fantastic for breaking down pig . Do n't wash , let them season , and be careful about getting water in the interior .	1
Good product . Quality item at a great price . Do n't waste time or money ... . This is a good way to go .	1
have n't used them yet but they are really good quality and will be good not to get burned when we use our fryer	1
I really like these . I have been able to keep the hairs on my hands a bit more intact , and they are certainly comfortable for my rather large hands ( usually wear XXL gloves ) . I ca n't say they make me grill any better , but they sure make it a lot more comfortable ...	1
These gloves fit my size 9 hands a bit on the large size but after leaving them out one nice Florida rainy night they now fit just right . The long cuffs are just right for opening the lid of my Weber Genesis 6611001 E-310 637-Square-Inch 38,000-BTU Natural-Gas Grill , Black . I have used leather gloves before this and my forearms were always a bit too warm for comfort . I cook outside about 4 times a week , summer , fall , winter ( if you can call it winter in Florida ) and spring working between the rain showers .	1
I was using the silicone oven mitts & # 34 ; grill gloves & # 34 ; that I purchased at Homedepot to cook on my grill and smoker . The only problem was that those gloves made it hard to use any grill tool such as Fork , Spatula and Tongs while cooking . I still need those silicone oven & # 34 ; grill & # 34 ; gloves to pick up hot items off and on the grill.These glove make it easier to use your grill Spatula to flip burgers and not worry about the flame touching you . Or using the Tongs when flipping other meats or vegetables . Since the glove comes up to my elbow I no longer feel the direct heat and making my cooking sessions more enjoyable . I would recommend these gloves to cook on the grill . But still keep the other heat resistant silicon oven mitts to put on and take off items off the grill . Since those can take the heat better . DO NOT TRY TO PICK UP ANYTHING HOT with these glove . The heat transfers real quick and your going to take these gloves off right away . I read that from other reviews on this product . Which I found out by beta testing these gloves .	1
I saw this at Walmart for $ 20.00 but this was like $ 5.00 less . Works good and is built much better then the cheap junk I got from Harbor Freight . The locking mechanism for the stem rocks !	1
I am impressed with the quality of the air chuck and the pressure gauge . The air chuck seats and 'grabs ' very well ( better than other models I 've owned ) and the pressure gauge matches the readings of two different gauges I have at home . I was initially worried about the quality , as I 've owned two others that did not measure pressure accurately ( one had the needle fall off the gauge ) . So far this seems far better quality .	1
Tire inflator works pretty well . I noticed that my unit was not like the one in the picture ; it was the MP6000 , not the MP6000AV -- the gauge only goes to 100psi and so it formatted differently than displayed . Not a problem for me as I 'm only doing car tires but if you have a semi or RV tire this could be some concern . The gauge is a little hard to interpret since the graduations are n't very instinctive to just glance at . I did n't have any problem whatsoever with the tire clip that some have expressed concern would n't fit on smaller car tires ; it fit fine on an 06 Chevy Aveo and an older 90s Nissan sentra and I ca n't see how it would cause problems for any other car as it 's very slender . Perhaps I got the improved design ? who knows . In any rate , the unit is of high quality , no leaks of any kind . I used to use a 12V cigarette plug inflator but that thing is crazy loud and takes forever just to fill up a few psi so I 've happily retired it to just emergency use . Well worth the money to get a good inflator so you can check you tires frequently enough . With the rising cost of gas , even a few psi can make you lose mileage quickly . This unit basically pays for itself .	1
Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure . Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate . I used the inflator and it was very easy to use . The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge . I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires . Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away . I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem . The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass . This gauge is nice and for the price you ca n't go wrong .	1
Great big clear gauge , my favorite inflator . Even works on motorcycle tires , very accurate readings , Looks very well made , should last for a few years .	1
works as it should..no problem..i always change the air chuck filler valve to the ball push on type..it a matter of choice..easy and cheap to change..do n't like the lever action..because 1.its hard to keep on , slips off 2. hard on valve stem if its old 3.wrong angle ... its a simple fix..plus the overinflat check valve is a nice feature..the last one i had lasted 5 years and i misplaced it..by the way i am a mechanic of 45 plus years..always looking for tools to make the job easier .	1
This is a nice addition to my tool chest . The gauge is accurate and the one hand operation is great . The pressure relief valve comes in handy when you over inflate any thing just make sure you buy the correct female coupler so you can put it to use right away .	1
This works very well as a tire inflator . As best I can tell , the gauge is accurate - at least within a few psi of accurate . The bleed valve is a nice feature.You will need a quick connect . This one works perfectly -Dixon DCP20B Brass Air Chief Industrial Interchange Quick-Connect Air Hose Fitting , Plug , 1/4 '' Coupling x 1/4 '' NPT FemaleI had no trouble with the valve connection and the red hose is plenty flexible to get wherever you need it . This is good for car tires with the big valve , but you will need an adapter for a presta valve . These work great -Slime 23042 Presta to Schrader Valve AdapterThere is a marking on the handle of this that says 100psi max , but the gauge reads to 150 psi . I did not have trouble getting my tires to 120 psi with this ( using a presta adapter ) .	1
I got this to go with my Craftsman air compressor that I recently got as the compressor only came with a basic inflator for the tires . I wanted one that had a gauge on it so you could read the tire pressure when you are inflating the tires . My compressor uses the & # 34 ; M & # 34 ; fittings , so I bought the Campbell Hausfield kit to go with it to be able to get it to connect to my compressor quick connects.The inflator is fairly simple to use , just put the chuck on the tire stem and pull the lever on the chuck and inflate . The gauge seems to be fairly accurate as I compared it to a regular tire gauge and the readings were the same.This inflator seems to be good quality and will work for what I need which is occasional use around the house . It is a decent price at around 14 bucks .	1
I bought this because I have trouble getting a good seal on my dual RV back tires valve stem . I have not yet tried it but I think this will work . I have a Sears tire inflator and the chuck 's mechanism for making a good seal on the valve stem is the opposite of this inflator . I have clearance problems when I try to use the Sears tire inflator on my dual back tires . I will give this 4 stars . After I tested this on my dual back tires I will revise the rating.I tested this inflator on my car tires . I am glad I bought this . I found out that my other tire inflator with it 's built in gauge was under inflating my tires about 6 psi . The chuck has a good and tight seal on the valve stem . I will give this product 5 stars.The built in spring loaded chuck lock is very simple to use . Press on the lock insert the chuck as far as it goes on the valve stem , release the lock and you have an air tight seal on tire 's valve stem . I also like the inflation trigger , one can gradually adjust the tire inflation to it 's recommended psi.I tried this on my RV with difficult to access valve stems on the back dual tires . It turns out it could not get a good seal on the valve stem . It seems to me the valve stem on my RV is longer than the hole or the chuck lock could not lock on the valve stem . For my cars it works well.I think the gauge works well . I have the pencil type gauge , which I think is not accurate . As soon as the chuck is tight on the valve stem the tire 's inflation psi shows on the gauge . One can then inflate using the inflation trigger or deflate if necessary using the release valve on the handle . Price is good..	1
Handy built in gauge so you know exactly how much pressure you are putting in your tires . I use it for everything from lawnmower to truck and it works accurately and easily .	1
Last spring my old tire inflater that I had purchased from Northern Tool years ago finally failed me . I was going to order another one from them but then I found this one on Amazon . I was very impressed with the price . It had more features than my old one and it was lower priced plus it was on sale too . What more could a man ask for ? This unit has performed flawlessly for me and I believe it 's been six months now that I have used it . I love the gauge on it and it 's accuracy . I like the fact that I can lock the air outlet on to the the stem of whatever I am inflating . I love the knob allows you to release air without removing the inflator because you over inflated . I like the trigger like lever that releases the air into the tire.This unit should last for years with proper care . It feels and looks like it is made of quality workmanship and material . It just has a good feel to it to me . I do n't know how long this tool would last in the hands of someone who abuses their tools . If a tool user is someone who slams their tools around or runs over them with a car because they were in too big a hurry to put the hose up , this tool may not last that long . Quite honestly if I see someone like that working on any of my stuff I will not go back to that garage again unless I think the mechanic is just having a bad day.All in all I think the average person who does most of their own work at home will really like this tool . I have yet to find any negatives on mine .	1
I received my saw today ... money well spent . I opened the box , checked the chain , filled it with oil and went to work ! ! ! Having read all the reviews submitted made my decision - an excellent decision it was , from the selections offered . Poulan is apparently affiliated with Husqvarna and so you get two great companies giving you a great chainsaw . Ron	1
I got this saw after an ice-storm in Tulsa caused serious damage to a dozen trees . It had no problem cutting through a 16 '' oak trunk.It 's a workhorse that performs well . It tends to drink oil , but I guess that 's good for performance and chain life.There 's a gizmo that 's a screwdriver/wrench for chain removal . I lost mine because THERE 'S NOWHERE ON THE SAW HOUSING TO STASH IT ( are you listening Poulan ) . Otherwise , chain adjustment and removal are pretty straightforward .	1
I recently had a large Bradford pear tree fall during a bad thunderstorm , and from its size and bushiness , I knew I would need a chainsaw to cut it all up small enough to haul to the curb . In addition , I also had a sick oak tree that needed to go to the curb with it . Although I am not particularly scared of chainsaws , I did n't like the idea of tangling with a `` Texas Chainsaw Massacre '' type of gas saw . I felt I could get more safety and ease of use , and almost as much power ( but certainly enough power to meet my needs ) with an electric chainsaw . This Poulan seemed to have everything I was looking for , especially with the power category checking in with 4 HP , so I had it overnighted with some oil and had at those trees over the weekend . I was pleasantly surprised at the impressive cutting power of this saw . As soon as I put it to a branch , chips were flying and wood was falling . It helped make quick work of both trees . I actually took the time to read the manual beforehand to be sure I understood the safety mechanisms , including the highly effective automatic chain brake , and I had no trouble operating the saw . When the chain finally slackened and fell off the bar ( after almost two hours of fresh-out-of-the-box cutting ) , I thought I would be able to get it back on in short order . In this area , however , the manual is a little lacking , and it was only when I put the manual aside and used my brain power that I was able to reattach the bar and chain to the saw and make use of the adjusting mechanism to tighten the chain . This saw does use a lot of oil , which is good for the life of the saw , but it makes clean up a bit of a chore with all those oil soaked wood chips in the main housing . Still , once you know how to take apart and put everything back together , the saw is not that difficult to clean up . As for overall ease of use , I honestly do n't think there could be anything better . I 've used electric chainsaws before , and none were as simple and strong as this one . So , even though this saw is not exactly perfect , I consider its drawbacks to be small enough that they do not warrant subtracting a star from its rating . Finally , one word of caution : You will need the recommended safety gear and it will protect you during use . Do n't assume because you 're dealing with `` only '' an electric saw that a T-shirt , shorts and a ball cap will be enough protection . This is a seriously powerful tool and you should definitely suit up properly . Make sure you include safety goggles and steel toed boots . When the chips start flying and that first log drops faster than you thought it could , you 'll be glad you did .	1
We purchased the first of these in a refurbished unit and did quite a bit of work on it before it started having trouble . The repair was minor but the bench fee was nearly the price of replacing so went ahead and bought a 2nd one - used the chain etc from the first as spares . Pleased with the purchse . For a fraction of the cost of having tree trimmers come out for one visit this gets the job done fast . Strong enough to make quick work of most jobs plus , living in a hurricane prone state means we often need to remove limbs , large branches or even trees that come down during a storm . Rather than wait days or even weeks - this allows us to move about the yard without danger . A must own - great price . reliable product .	1
UPDATE 3/18/2010 : Last week the winds hit 60 mph and another tree came down ... .a 60 foot pine . This saw did it 's job , and at the risk ruining the chain , I 'm going to try to get through the rootball . In my first review I said you do n't need a gas chainsaw , and I meant it , however , when you have no power , a gas chainsaw is a Godsend ! ( At least , I think it would be ) . LOL . Even still , I am so happy with this purchase . This is such a great saw , my neighbors used it as well , and they love it , too . The only thing to keep in mind when you are cutting thick pieces of trunk is that you do n't want the tree to collapse onto the blade and lock you up . This can happen if you get cocky ( and it 's easy to do with this saw , because it is soooo capable ! ) .Two weeks ago we had 50+ mph winds and as luck would have it , my neighbors tree fell into my driveway ( and SUV ) . FYI this is MY responsibility , as it is an act of God . This is according to my insurance company . Had I informed my neighbor in writing that his trees were endangering my property , I am told it would have been his responsibility . I just mention this for anyone reading so they can start sending out letters . Anyway , as I said , as luck would have it , and I am a lucky guy , the tree just dented and scratched the SUV , but nobody was hurt . Since my neighbor offered to help clear the tree and was never heard from again I decided to order this chain saw and clear it out myself . Please note the base of the tree is a bit over 22 inches ! I ordered this chain saw because it was the biggest I could find , and because I had heard good things about Poulan . I should note that a couple of years ago I used a friends 14 inch chain saw , and another FYI , take breaks every half an hour if you are not used to it , and make sure the chain is sharp , otherwise you could end up damaged the ligaments in your hand/arm . I wore a brace for 6 months . So , back to the review ... .Because of poor weather , getting home late , etc. , I did not have a chance to dispatch the tree until tonight . I can honestly say it took me less than 45 minutes , working in the dark and by myself . This is one awesome chain saw . It is not as heavy as I thought it would be and very easy to handle . Make sure you add enough oil , but be careful as it is very easy to overfill , as I found out . Also be sure to tighten the chain , especially in the beginning as it becomes a bit slack and there is a very real danger that it can come off and really hurt you . This does draw a heck of a lot , so make sure you are using a very good extension cord ( 12 gauge ) , and probably not more than 50 feet . As far as kick back , I experience very little , and only when I knew it was comming . For example , when I was about to hit another branch , and even then it was nothing major . The kickback guard is probably not going to do all that much if it really comes back at you hard , but read the booklet , as it tells you how to avoid it . Do not try to use this on small twigs or branches , it will just whip them around . Always wear eye protection , and always pay attention to your stance and be sure the saw is directly in front of you , not on the side . Also , if you are cutting a thick trunk , as I did , it is better to have a friend in case you need to put a wedge in the cut ( sometimes the tree can come back on itself and lock up the blade , and that could be VERY dangerous ) . Always keep it properly oiled and clean and you should be very happy with this . I prefer this over a gas powered chain saw for many reasons . It does not require gas . You do n't need to play with a choke . You can turn it on and off easily and quickly . Honestly , you do n't NEED a gas chain saw unless you are going to be doing a lot of serious cutting . This will do just about everything a gas chain saw can , unless you need the portability of gas . That is the only reason I can see getting a gas one over this . I am not happy with my purchase , I am thrilled ! I ca n't imagine anyone not loving it ... ..just remember , read the booklet ! and , be careful .	1
This Gilmour brass quick connector is made in China . As with other Gilmour products it has a warning that it contains a chemical known by the state of California to cause cancer . That is nothing new about China using dangerous chemicals . On the good news side the parts of the connector that are handled have a rubber cover which hopefully is safe.I have been using the plastic quick connectors and they have worked well but I just wanted to see how a brass one would perform . The main difference that I have noticed is that the plastic ones are easier to connect and disconnect . However , both types provide satisfactory performance and do not leak . The main difference is that the plastic Gardena connectors that I have been using cost about half the amount of the brass Gilmour . The Gardena connectors are made in Germany .	1
i was skeptical about these , but i tried them anyway . glad i did.i was worried that they may affect the water pressure somehow , and my worries were unfounded . these things are great . i 'm using them for everything.the only problem is that you will realize how many of them you actually need , and you 'll buy a lot of them.FYI , i was able to pick up the male+female connector set at lowe 's for around $ 6 ( HD does n't carry this brand ) . you may want to check there first before ordering here . but as far as the product itself goes , it 's top notch .	1
Chunk those cheap plastic connectors and save tempers . I could have used several sets of these years ago ; however , today one is sufficient for present needs . I use teflon tape to assure 100 % drip-less action and now can disconnect our hose with ease and speed . Gilmour makes life so much simpler when all parts work well and last far longer than the plastic ones . Additionally , this connector set is a no issue set . Put it on the bib and forget about it . When winter comes it will stay in place and be ready for use in the spring . I highly recommend and will buy another as soon as I get a new connector elsewhere .	1
I have one of these on each spray nozzle that I own so it is easy to change nozzles in a few seconds by popping one off and another on . If a rubber washer is used , there is no leaking from this connector . It is extremely easy to use . I also recommend a piece of teflon tape around the threaded areas to prevent a corrosion/ chemical reaction and fusion when the different metals touch water and each other.There are two kinds of these connectors by Gilmour . The real brass connectors are excellent and get a 5 star . The `` metal '' connectors are horrible and get a 1 star . I did get some from Lowes , and there seems to be a problem with corrosion since they are `` metal '' ( aluminum ) and not brass . The problem here is over a small amount of time ( months ) , water hardness deposits and corrosion prevent the connector from locking into place with the female . The smoothness of operation that it started out with , becomes rough , and a struggle over time . STAY AWAY FROM THE `` METAL '' ONES AND ONLY GO WITH THE TRUE BRASS ONES ! ! ! I found an interchangeable solid brass connector like this at Ace HardwareACE BRASS QUICK CONNECTOR SET , also made by Gilmour that even has an automatic shutoff built in ! I also give that one a 5 star rating because you do not even have to shut off the hose to change between nozzles . You can use regular Gilmour males with Ace Hardware females interchangeably . If you are going to fill buckets , I recommend this regular Gilmour brass connector , as opposed to that one , since that has the automatic shutoff feature which wo n't let you fill the bucket without a spray nozzle .	1
I have about 5 sets of these for each hose at my house as well as my Gilmour foam gun , AR pressure washer , CR Spotless , and a couple of hose nozzles . The brass is strong , the mechanics are crisp , and the rubber gives excellent impact protection . The only thing you will be replacing from this equation is the o-rings every year or so , depending on use . This set will make your life a whole lot easier , and no more struggling in trying to loosen or tighten the hose from the house .	1
Forget about the cheaper plastic varieties - this is the one to get.. no plastic on this one at all and has held up well so far.Once you repair a hose , it will never be the same , but if you have to squeeze some more life out of your hose , this would be the coupling to use .	1
I needed to replace a leaky connection . I had gone down the plastic route before and it is a fine line between tightening it enough so it will NOT leak , but at the same time , NOT over tightening it so that the plastic does not strip out . It is a very fine line . Then I found this rascal and those concerns are history !	1
I expect this nozzle to out-last my hose and reuse it several times over . Also , being made of brass , and aluminum my hose nozzle does n't get stuck on the thread like those plastic ones that expand when it 's been out in the sun too long !	1
In the past I 've always limited my search for hose couplings to local hardware stores . That was a mistake . After searching Amazon and finding this highly rated product , I decided to give it a try . Boy is this a heck of a lot better than what I 've been getting.Installation is a cinch and once you have it screwed on , it is n't coming off.The threaded part of this coupling is nicely machined and screws together nicely with other attachments . After I tried one of these , I immediately bought more and used them to replace the couplings on my other hoses .	1
This coupling worked well . It 's easy to install and so far I have no leaks . It 's sturdy , much better than the plastic coupling I had purchased earlier .	1
Hose leaked , about a foot from the end , cut it off , slapped this baby on . No leaks . Sprayer went on and everything works as expected . Might want to have something on hand to lubricate the inside of the hose before installing . Was an extremely tight fit on my hose , and be careful about twisting to get it seated , as the threads are fairly sharp and managed to open a few spots on two fingers when it slipped a little .	1
Rather than 12 different patterns this is more the more you squeeze the more you get . Last nozzle we bought last less than a year and it had rusted solid to the hose so this one I applied blue grease in hopes it does n't rust together .	1
As soon as you put this in your hand you will kick yourself for not having bought it sooner . Like many , I bought $ 1 , $ 5 , $ 7 nozzles that lasted all of one season . They are just cheap junk . We forget about how often we replace them because they are cheap at the time . This particular model is their heavy duty , which should last though hot summers and cold winters . It has brass components , a nice sturdy feel and is rated for both extreme hot and cold water conditions . It attaches easily and does not drip at all during use . A small depression of the handle gives you a gentle fan while a full depression gives you a powerful stream . Compare this one with that cheapo you have now and you will clearly see the difference . It is certainly money well spent .	1
I am glad I purchased this nozzle . This is a quality product that feels well made and sprays like its internal components are top grade . In a day when things are often cheaper and worse , here is a nozzle that is well made , feels solid in your hand and puts out a great spray .	1
It is getting harder and harder to find nozzles like this that have infinately variable spray , ranging from a fan to a steady stream just by squeezing the lever . Most new ones require you to twist a nozzel on the end ... which is a waste of time when washing a car . I have used this before . I have 3 worn out ones in my garage . I was happy to see they have a lifetime warranty which I did not know . The picture does not show it , but it has a nozzel shield surrounding the threads on the spray end . Helpful in case it falls up against a fender ! Works great .	1
I have bought so many hose nozzles over the years , from cheap to not-so-cheap . They last a few seasons and then get clogged , leak or just plain break . This Gilmour nozzle feels like it will last forever . Nice solid feel , easy to use , good control over spray and velocity . The threaded front is a bonus . I add a & # 34 ; water breaker & # 34 ; to turn it into a gentle shower head for watering potted plants , without slowing me down by restricting the water volume output . I can also screw on a pressure nozzle for a more focused spray and still have the pistol grip on/off . Really happy with this purchase !	1
It took a minute to decide how to adjust the spray but once I found that it was great ! this is a precise spraying nozzle . And i 've tried a bunch . this one appears to hold up well and wish I had bought it sooner . a good productWell made for the money .	1
Nozzles exactly like this ( except for the plastic cover ) have been around for at least 40 years , manufactured in a dozen companies , and sold under a wide variety of brand names -- -for a very good reason -- -they are the best design . They are perfectly and easily controllable , durable , and do n't leak . Functionally speaking , you ca n't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.IMPROVEMENT ON A CLASSIC > The plastic grip cover and plastic handle provide insulation if very hot or very cold water is flowing through the nozzle. > The larger grip is more comfortable > The plastic lever is rust-proof . Unfortunately , most recent `` classic '' garden nozzles of this type are made with cheap , poorly chrome-plated , levers which rust easilyNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed . If you wish , you can tighten the screw ( you may need pliers to do so ) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream ( with the handle lever fully depressed ) for long throws -- that makes long throws a little easier.One reviewer complains that there is no `` medium '' strength , e.g. , for filling buckets . What do you expect ? The actual `` problem '' , as far as that reviewer was concerned , is the nozzle is `` too good '' -- -it delivers full pressure , at all but the tightest mist setting . Although it does have a `` closed '' position , this is a nozzle , NOT a valve . If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE , then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-OfforGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle . Or , close your faucet part way . Alternatively , to fill a bucket , loosen the thumb screw , then `` open 'er up '' ( squeeze the handle lever all the way ) -- -the result is is maximum unfocused flow , which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket , etc.CAVEATSHere in the tropics ( South Florida ) -- the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools . After a year or two , the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew . I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you do n't have silicon grease on hand , buy a tube -- -it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items , and even for lubricating things such as this . While you are at it , lubricate all your hose connections ( both the threads and the seals ) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease ? Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals . However even petroleum grease is better than no grease ( besides most hose gaskets are now plastic , not rubber ) After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can begin to get stiff , presumably caused by internal corrosion ( or the original grease having deteriorated or lost ) . Ideally , keep the nozzle dry -- -at least do n't keep it in a muddy puddle , or half-buried in acidic soil . It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff . ( With the water off , squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod . Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston ) . If the nozzle is very stiff , take it off the hose , spray it heavily with WD-40 , let it soak for 15 minutes or so -- -that will probably adequately loosen it up , but is not a permanent solution -- -you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes -- -reasonably well taken care of ( or at least not abused ) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES > Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles , such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle . These are virtually indestructable , and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it. > High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S > There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $ 1 -- $ 2 in `` bargain bins '' , which are a good deal for the price , but are not nearly as durable , and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer. > There are versions with `` select-a-pattern '' spray heads on the front , which sabotages the virtues of the basic design , reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying . For example ( not recommended ) Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red > Several models combine the full-action of the basic design with a `` select-a-pattern '' spray head . These are worthy of serious consideration.Gilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/TealorGilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584 . The select-a-pattern makes several tasks easier , such as filling a bird-bath , and finely misting very delicate plants.NERD CORNER : The zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action . I.e. , the zinc will `` sacrifice '' itself ( and corrode ) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching , or with which it is sharing a conducting solution ( such as a water-saturated acidic soil ) , or salt-water . So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted , ungalvanized steel , or salt water . ( Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose , to prevent the iron from rusting -- not as a barrier like paint , but rather by electrolytic action ) .What about those other pretty , fancy , mostly plastic sprayer nozzles ( which cost 3x -- 4x more ) that you see at the garden center ? -- -they do n't work nearly as well , and wo n't last nearly as long . I know this for a fact -- -my wife keeps buying them -- -indeed we have a bin of discarded ( mostly still functional ) `` pretty '' sprayer nozzles , which have `` fallen out of favor '' for various reasons .	1
As you may know , there are a lot of junk gardening tools around . This particular nozzle is well-constructed , has adjustable spray and a keep-on lever , and does not leak . That 's good enough for me .	1
this took less than a minute to assemble and its holding all the tools I needed it to . overall i am happy with it and its very functional . doesnt look too bad either . ours is on a covered patio area but I can see this looking nicer in a shed , etc .	1
I had a little corner in my carport where tools and other items seemed to gather , and it was getting junky looking . I placed them in the tool rack , and it looks nice and neat , and kind of cool , too . This little caddy actually held quite a few tools !	1
My husband loves this . I thought it was a little expensive , but it really does keep everything together in one spot . We even have our edger on there , and everything fits nicely . Its a thick , heavy plastic , but looks nice .	1
I am glad this rack has casters which makes it easier to move around . The roof of my tool shed is low and I have to move it out from under the roof to store and remove tools . It is an excellent accessory to contain a number of tools in a small place .	1
I purchased 2 of these for my landscaping business to try to organize tools that get used often but not everyday . It holds a lot , but is top heavy . If it had a wider base or could be fastened down it would be great . I think it would be fine for a homeowner to use for a few miscellaneous tools .	1
The rack was easy to assemble , it rolls with total ease , and is sturdy . It offers a great way to organize those things that otherwise clutter the garage . I do n't have to look and dig to find them anymore . It 's Rubbermaid so it should last a long time . The rack is a winner .	1
I bought this organizer to clean up the stacks of tools I had leaning against every wall in my shed . It did the perfect job . My husband even commented on the great choice I made . Very durable and sets up in just a minute .	1
Normally , I would give a cheap plastic item like this two or three stars for a price tag of around $ 50 , but I have made an exception for this wonderful product here . If there was a king of cheap plastic products , I suppose rubber made should have the crown.When I first un-boxed this item prior to assembly , I was quite concerned about how stable it would be . After the 10 second assembly ( 2 seconds of looking at the picture on the box and 8 seconds to then put it together ) I was quite surprised how study it really is . As long as I do n't toss/yank my tools around when I am storing/removing them , I would be the least bit surprised to see this thing last a life time.Did I mention yet how nicely all my tools are organized in the garage as apposed to the previous pyramid stacking in the corner . Before to get to one tool I would have to move two or more items , now I can just reach and grab the one I want . That is something worth paying more for.All that being said I give it five stars . Although I believe this item could be cheaper , being that it may last a very long time I can understand Rubbermaid wanting a bit more profit for it . Also you would be hard pressed to find it cheaper than this .	1
The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once ! I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel . They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice . I fit all my handled yard tools on it , and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall . If it had a large handle on the side , like a push-cart has it would be 100 % perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on . Just a thought , manufacturer ... ..	1
Got tired of buying all those little cans for 3+ bucks each , so got this to hookup the 20lb tank I got from Lowe 's to my newCuisinart CGG-200 All-Foods 12,000-BTU Portable Outdoor Tabletop Propane Gas Grill . Works great . No problems at all.So when grilling at home , we 'll be using this . For camping or tailgating or anything , we 'll go with the little cans.It all seems so obvious ... so if you 're in the same situation - get this and save money . It works , and you do n't need any extra adapters .	1
Not much to review here . Only thing it does is let you use a full size propane tank with grills that use the smaller portable propane tanks.It works , and is long enough to reach .	1
I love my new trition camp stove and this connector works perfectly . The first time I set it up I had to redo it a few times to get all the connections correct . The key was the stove part , it has to be screwed all the way in and pointed away from the front of the stove .	1
I got this for our Cuisinart portable grill . For home use it 's fantastic because I do n't have to rely on the little bottles and when they are going to run out . I just hook it up to my large propane tank . When I take the grill out it still works with the little propane bottles . Fantastic deal and the price is reasonable .	1
Had this for over a year now . Bought it to connect my Cuisinart CGG-200 to Blue Rhino Propane tank . On a full tank , this hose works great . Recently , the pressure seems to have dropped resulting in weak flames . Since it was working previously , I did n't suspect the hose and thought it was my tank . ( but switching tank did n't help ) . I thought it was the grill inlet or burner being blocked but both appeared to be fine too after inspection.I deduced something could be blocking in the hose . Air/water/whatever ? I never did figure that out but my only option was to find a way to clear the hose passageway . I turned on the grill and let it burn ( irregular and weak flames ) . While burning , I turned off the propane tank and let the grill burn up the remaining gas in the hose until the flame died . I then turn on the propane tank and let it fill up the hose again and repeatedly ignite the burner . This approach works ! So was it a lousy hose or was it due to elements caused by the varying weather since my grill is out in the yard 24x7 ? Anyhow , clearing the hose appears to solve the problem for me multiple times.If the hose is still working , why then did I rate it as 3-star ? It 's because I do n't think a propane hose should require any maintenance at all . Just like a garden hose , it should behave as expected and not require workaround . I 'm planning to get a different brand hose and see if such problem persist . If it does n't , this rating should drop to 2-star . ***9/28/2013***Hose still working good despite the intermittent weak flames issue . It appears my 'clear the hose ' method resolved the issue consistently each time it occurs . I 'm deducing it is the combination of changing weather ( my grill is outdoor all the time ) and long period of non-usage that caused the issue . In all fairness , since the hose is operating fine for more than 2 years now , I 'm bumping the rating from 3 to 4 stars .	1
I picked this feeder because I was n't sure any birds would find my feeder , and I do n't have a ton of disposable income.I 'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet . It 's my fault , I hung it too close to the house , but it 's all I 've got , really . So I watch the squirrels , who eat a LOT of food . But ! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it ! The feeder is plastic , so I imagine it 'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time . Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I 'm filling it , which is a drag . But that 's me being picky . For the price , it 's a terrific feeder !	1
I like this feeder very much seems like there are a lot more birds coming around with it . More birds can eat at one time now	1
What a bargain ... Garden Song 480-12 Classic Bird Feeder ... 7.98 ... I bought three of them ... .I am building a bird sanctuary and I am trying several different types !	1
First , this was given to be as a gift by my kids , and initially I loved it , and I thought that because of the design , I would n't have all the problems I 'd had with other feeders . To be fair to Garden Song , the design looked like it would serve birds better than all other critters . But then , still sticking to design , it 's not one of the sturdier feeders . The plastic is indeed cheap.Now , if you live in North America , you have rats - usually Norwegian Wood Rats . They may live down the block from you , but if you put up a feeder , you 're going to have your own daily ( and sometimes nocturnal ) visitors . These are n't cute little mice carrying disease and eating the insulation off your wiring . These are wood rats carrying disease and eating insulation off your cable TV wiring and sometimes nesting in your attic or crawl space.I thought with just little spokes sticking out for the birds to perch on that ( and the way I hung it ) would discourage squirrels and rats . Face facts : NOTHING discourages squirrels and rats . Now squirrels and mice may be cute , but BIG rats , no . And all are destructive and reproduce like crazy . I moved the Garden Song as far away from our one maple tree as I could . Turns out that rats can jump and are as acrobatic as squirrels.This is for the birds , and as much as I love birds , I 've had to shelve this feeder until I can find a way to make it rat proof.I emphasize that this is n't Garden Song 's fault . ALL bird feeders are like grain bins and their attraction is irresistible . In fairness , I 'm knocking one star off for the construction and nothing for its attraction to vermin.IF ANY OF YOU HAVE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION , I 'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR IT . I 'd love to put this feeder back up .	1
I got it for the birds , and so far the birds really like it . Seems to hold up in our sometimes very inclimate weather with no problems .	1
I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it . Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches `` lock in '' to the tube ... generating a very solid feel . The `` comfort perches '' are amazing ... the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other , and the finches who are waiting for `` their turn '' , sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation . The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed . The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds ( doves , pigeons ) from stealing the seed from the `` little ones '' . The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean . I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun . I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers .	1
I have this feeder placed right outside my window of my ground floor apartment . I originally got it for the cats ' entertainment , and am glad I did.I originally had a feeder bell hanging from the second floor apartment 's balcony , but decided it was n't enough.I purchased this feeder for the sparrows and used the cheapest bird feed available . After I switched to sunflower seeds only I am now getting sparrows , finches and starlings . The down side being that the perches were not designed for starlings so they have to reach around to one of the other holes to get their food.Anymore , I can get 5 or so on it at once with two or three hanging out on the chain it hangs from waiting in line.I really love this little feeder and have had it since December '08 . Never once had a problem with squirrels , but it may be because of the way I have it set up .	1
This is a lightweight , easy to clean , plastic bird feeder with a decent capacity . OK , the squirrels make light work of the contents but then you just need to put it out of their reach .	1
I live in an area where people leave their livestock to roam around . There are a lot of goats , sheep , donkeys that generally roam around and find their way home at night.The free roaming livestock make it difficult to have flowers , shrubs or plants around the house . You can be sure a goat will pass by and make short work of your flowers . The alternative had bee to build mesh wire fences around flowers . Although this was not meant for them i decided to try it out . Worked like magic ! Stray livestock no longer come near my flowers or plants . they do n't even bother tasting them . One whiff of the smell and off they go . I do n't know how long the smell will last though . It 's been working ok for the past week . The battery powered spayer is also easy to operate and makes the application a lot easier that if it had been manually powered . Do n't know about deer , rabbits or squirrels , but if you have your neighbors livestock disturbing your flowers , this will surely keep them away ,	1
Deer ? ( check ) Rabbits ? ( check ) Bears ? ( check ) Turkeys ? ( check ) Squirrels ? ( check ) Alligators ? ( not yet and they do n't care about our trees or veggies anyways ) One month and a couple of strong rain showers later the rabbits are back and we saw some deer . One application appears to be effective at least for a couple of weeks for as long as the weather stays dry . I will grant this product 4 stars ( I like it ) because there ca n't be a universal and permanent solution to wild life invasions for those of us who insist on living in areas claimed by wild creatures as their own . I like it because is one non-violet way of keeping the unwanted away from places we want to protect . It 's not a 'five-star ' because the marketing claims of 3-month effectiveness are wildly exaggerated and because the price is a little bit at the high end.This is how it worked for us - took notes throughout the test : BEFORE APPLICATION : Rabbits seen almost daily , deer come and go as they please because the dogs ' invisible fence prevents them from protecting the area.WEEK ONE : Weather was dry . Saw a bunny , no deer.WEEK TWO : Weather was hot , mostly dry , a few light showers , one thunderstorm . No rabbits or deer.WEEK THREE : Weather normal , a couple of showers . Spotted a couple of rabbits in the evening.WEEK FOUR : Back to the 'before application ' state.The attached sprayer makes it easy to apply the repellent and , for as long as you 're not moving against the wind it appears to be safe to spray without a face mask or any other kind of protection . Do n't forget to shake .	1
This really works to keep the critters away from your garden.It 's particularly effective against the deer who eat your flowers/plants.The battery-powered sprayer makes it easy and quickly to spray the contents onto your plants . The other side effect is that dogs and cats will also be repelled by this , so you wo n't have the neighborhood pets peeing on your flower bed : )	1
I got this repellent primarily to keep squirrels away from around our bird feeder . I paid close attention to see if the product was actually working and I did see a s difference . Squirrels were still around but they would not come close to the area I treated with the repellent . The effect lasted for a few days ( which is expected ) so I am pleased with this repellent.The battery powered sprayer works well and it makes it a lot easier to spray . I do recommend this product .	1
We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season , and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets , since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard . Instead , it uses egg to make it smell like something dead , and capsaisin to make it taste awful . So when you spray it , it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact , this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product , so it can be used safely ! The sprayer is a bit cumbersome , but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area . This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet , and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring .	1
( Original Text : April 20 , 2013 ) I hate how my spring flowers are devoured by hungry rabbits as they emerge in the spring and I was very happy that none of the protected plants have been gnawed on this year.The `` Deer-off '' spray is easy to apply and the big bottle I have of it will last me the entire season and maybe even more.I was afraid that it would smell ghastly when I sprayed it on my plants , but I did n't notice much of an odor at all . I do n't have a problem with deer eating my plants , so I ca n't say how suitable it is for that , but it seems to work very well for repelling rabbits . The only thing I 've needed to do is to refresh the spray on the plants after a rainfall.The only negative thing I have to say is that the included batteries were completely dead and I needed to insert 4 fresh alkaline batteries.Update : Aug , 2013I 've been spritzing my garden vegetables over the summer and it 's done a good job keeping the critters at bay . I 'm pretty happy : )	1
First , be sure to read all the instructions on the sheet folded into a tiny packet and tucked in the side pocket with the sprayer . Then , shake the container well ( remove the side-hanger for the spray handle first ) as settled particles will plug the spray pick-up tube . ( If you forget as I did , I used an old plastic milk jug with plain water in it , inserted the sprayer pick-up tube and ran it until it finally cleared . ) Replace the side storage pocket before or after spraying ... it is a very well thought-out device to store the spray nozzle/handle . The battery-powered spray nozzle is a nice feature ; much easier on fingers not having to keep squeezing the sprayer . Plus , it is possible to take the spray wand off a bigger spray container ( or buy a spray wand ) and exchange the tip to reach farther if needed . I have had squirrels using the top of my board fence to gain access to my awning and roof , as well as run down the length of the fence top teasing my dog . It would just sit there on top of the fence chattering and driving the dog nuts ! I sprayed all areas where the squirrel could gain access to the top of the fence and all along the top of the fence . No sign of any squirrel since . Thank you for a product that finally works , even after a couple storms with rain.7/9/2012 : Saw a squirrel on the fence top yesterday so it is time to re-apply . It lasted a good month which is nearly ... no , it is ... a miracle . I 've never had this type of product last more than a day or two at most . I love it ! ! !	1
We live out in the country , and my wife is an avid gardener . We also have a roaming band of deer , usually 3-4 , as well as rabbits , I 've personally seen 3 at once in our yard . We do n't have many squirrels , I guess the cats and coyotes take care of them.. We have experimented with bloodmeal , and a variety of other home remedies that have n't worked very well.This product however , has worked quite well . We have not seen any rabbits/deer , or prints from either in any of the gardens we have applied it to . The battery sprayer works well , I 'm not sure it 's really necessary for the size of our gardens , I probably would n't pay extra for it . I will purchase the concentrate in the future , as the pre-made mixture will not last a season , and seems to come at a premium price .	1
I 've always loved feeding squirrels and birds in my back yard . That is , until this year , when we adopted two puppies who seem to be BORN squirrel chasers and bird killers ( Yorkshire terrier/poodle mixes ) . As soon as this proclivity evidenced itself last Spring , I had to stop feeding . The squirrels did n't cotton to their new status , and started munching on our pecan tree instead . Not the nuts . The TREE . Unfortunately , this was n't evident until midsummer , when even large branches started to die . They 'd skinned the bark off large portions of the tree 's large branches & by the time we saw evidence of it , our arborist said it was much too late to save . A producing pecan tree has been reduced to a small , sad pile of barbecue wood.I wish I 'd found Deer Off sooner ; I think we could have saved the little Pecan , because IT WORKS . I 'm using it now to discourage the one surviving squirrel from being caught and mauled by the dogs . I 've sprayed it along the top of a wooden fence and into several crape myrtles that were his favorite perches . So far , so good . He 's staying in the front yard , except for the occasional barking he does at the dogs from the untreated roofline . And the neighborhood is quiet again . Peace reigns : ) It 's easy to spray , thanks to the battery-powered spray head & it even comes with 4 AA batteries so it 's ready to go as soon as you are . I was surprised that this did n't have an offensive odor ( to humans ) -- even while spraying , I did n't notice a particularly strong odor , even though the ingredients include `` putrescent eggs . '' But the squirrels and the dogs did . It does n't seem to bother the birds . I applied one treatment exactly one month ago today & it 's still working . If you 've got a squirrel problem , give this a try . It 's working for me ; highly recommended for its ease of use , quick application , and effectiveness.5/24/13 Update : I got lazy and stopped applying this , since it seemed that all was quiet on the Western Front . RIP Bobby Joe Squirrel , dispatched by the Tornado Twins . I feel guilty : (	1
I have family in New Jersey that have been struggling with an ever-increasing deer population for decades . This provided the perfect location to give Deer Off II a try . Given how ineffective other products have been , I was n't expecting much when I first applied the spray . But after just one use , I could see the difference.Now , after six months , I can say that Deer Off II is more effective than any other commercially prepared product that I have tried - not sure why since the ingredients - egg and pepper - seem to be similar . The odor is noticeable but not nearly as strong as I was expecting and less offensive than most.What really made a difference to me was the ease of use . Deer Off II comes with a battery-powered sprayer , which makes application a breeze . The sprayer runs on 4 included AA batteries so you can spray right from the bottle without any mixing , which many other brands require.As for the applicator itself , a small battery-powered pump is contained in the spray handle . It worked smoothly and provided a consistent and strong trajectory . You will need to prime the pump for a minute or more the first time you use it but after that , the product comes out easily.The cost of Deer Off II compares to similar ready-to-use products . Concentrates work out to be less expensive but are more cumbersome to use . While the cost may be a bit more , the motorized sprayer makes a huge difference when spraying larger areas.I admit I was skeptical about Deer Off II but after six months of using it , the results have been dramatic.And for New Jersey , that is saying a lot .	1
This year 's early and warmer spring resulted in an abundance of overactive rabbits in our yard , with our day lilies being the biggest casualty.I was favorably impressed by the battery powered sprayer which made application really easy . While I do n't have conclusive evidence of its effectiveness , I have n't noticed any additional damage since my first application 3 weeks ago . Fingers crossed .	1
I kind of like the deer that live near my home , and I 'm all for bunnies . But squirrels ! ! ! They are demonic . They undermine asphalt and make holes for the horses to step in . Hate 'em ! So , this allows you to treat areas with a spray to `` discourage '' them from showing up . It does n't kill them , just makes them feel unwelcome , like they should be moving on . I 'm not sure how long they 'll stay away ... I will update the review if they rush back in droves . I 'd also like to know , once the rain starts , if that effects how long it works.It 's intended to use around plants and shrubs you want undisturbed ( I 'm hoping it keeps the skunks out of the salad bar , I mean , lettuce ) , but since it has pesticide warnings , I did n't use it near my vegetables . But the plants that they seem to love along our yard borders is where I put it , in hopes to keep them out.It is supposed to work by creating a gross taste and smell to them , although it 's odorless when you spray it.For now , those bad guys are gone . I did n't have to murder them , so I do n't feel bad , and so far as I can tell , this is going to last at least through the summer into fall when the squirrel population seems to explode . The bottle promises three months , which is a bargain , and I plan to use it just once or twice year when they are at their worst.Oh , and the sprayer uses a battery so you do n't get tired spraying everywhere . Overkill it seems , but useful .	1
Since we live in the country , we have a lot of wildlife in our yard . While they are cute to look at , they can do a lot of damage , and some of them do n't smell very good ( SKUNKS ) ! We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals . This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer `` trimmed '' all our shrubs , even the ones right next to the house . Since our area was hit hard by EHD this past year , we did n't have that problem this past winter ; and I was delighted this morning to see three deer walking down our driveway . I love watching all the wildlife , and just try to keep them out of the flowers and vegetable garden .	1
I 've maintained a garden patch for quite a few years and it has always been affected by some type of animals . First , there were squirrels until I built a small fence . Then there were deer until I built a bigger fence . Then , squirrels found their way in from the top and others from below.This Deer Off seems to be helping more than any of these . I did n't spray it around the whole yard ( that 's just mean ) , but I did set up quite the perimeter around my garden and I have n't had any animals intruding there whatsoever . Is this the work of the Deer Off spray , or is it simply coincidence ? I 'd like to think the spray is working just fine .	1
I have a lot of rabbit and deer damage in my garden if I do n't spray . I like to alternate various sprays to keep them guessing . This worked very well against both rabbits and deer . I sprayed some potted begonias that had been eaten down to stubs and they are now thriving and the same with some balloon flowers . I assume it was the rabbits that were eating them although I never actually saw the culprit . At any rate this spray took care of the problem . It also protected my day lilies against the deer than had been munching on them . Easy to apply too .	1
I 'm a terrible gardener . So when I finally got my watermelons to bud and start to grow I was extremely happy ... until I went out and checked on them one day and either the deer or rabbits ate them all.This is a hazard for me as I 'm right next to a very large forrested area . While I enjoy seeing the wildlife I did n't want to keep losing my fruits and veggies to them so I got this Deer Off . I 'm happy to say that I 've not had any part of my garden taken so far . And since I localized the spray to just around the garden I still see the animals on the far side of the yard ( a couple hundred feet away . ) I 'm happy with this product and wish I 'd gotten it prior to losing my watermelons .	1
Anyone engaged in the often futile battle of deer vs. the garden plants knows that high quality repellent is important as is the delivery system . Those of us who have come close to carpal-tunnel syndrome from squeezing sprayers have just been saved by the gleefully easy-to-use automated delivery system in this Deer Off product . Not only does Deer Off work very well , but it is now a pleasure to spray when all you need to do is pull the trigger and hose down the plants you want to protect from those voracious appetites.Although Deer Off works very well , it is not rain fast , and needs to be re-applied after rain . Also , deer will grow used to anything , so it is best used in rotation ( every 2-3 months ) with another type of deer repellant.The true innovation in this packaging though is the battery operated sprayer . I hope to see it in additional products ( herbicides , insecticides , etc. ) . It uses 4 AA batteries ( which come with the package ) . Switch from Lock to On , and you are ready to go . The nozzle adjusts between stream and spray depending on your target . Nothing could be simpler .	1
I found Deer Off II to be effective . I have used it several times . The ingredients are not too different than some other products . In this review , I compare Deer Off II to Deer Stopper and my home made solution as I use these three equally . I tend to switch products each season/year , and I tend to buy over the internet rather than locally . My reasoning is that over time some animals will become used to a repellent and it may not be as effective . While it still works to a degree , if everyone in your neighborhood is buying the same brand spray from your local store , while the deer may not like it , once they are hungry enough , they 'll learn to live with it . I do n't have any scientific data to back that up ; it 's just my humble opinion.So back to Deer Off II . I find it stops the deer and rabbits in my flower/shrub garden . Unfortunately , deer tend to travel in groups , so if you get five in your yard and each bite at a bloom , well there goes 5 or 6 blooms by the time they realize `` Hey this does n't taste good . `` But in general , I find they tend to avoid the areas sprayed with Deer Off II . Its main ingredients are egg and pepper , which are common in this type of repellent . For me , Deer Off II has been effective . I have a good deal of deer around my home and it seems to have kept them at bay.You can , of course , make your own spray by adding an egg , some chili powder , and a couple of squirts of dishwashing liquid to a gallon of water and letting it sit in the sun with the bottle capped . The egg will soon go bad and you 'll have a very inexpensive alternative . Then each time you add water to the gallon bottle , you add another egg . The only issue there is home made spray tends to wash off with each rain , whereas store bought products adhere longer through rains . The dishwashing liquid helps the home made spray adhere a little.The odor of Deer Off II is noticeable , but no worse than other products . Store bought spays tend to smell a little more than the home made spray . Obviously you want to be up-wind when you spray no matter what you use ! Deer Stopper has a less offensive scent than most other products , including Deer Off II.So , why buy Deer Off II and not a different brand ? The ingredients are about the same . The biggest selling point is the Deer Stopper II motorized spray . It runs on 4 AA batteries ( included ) , so you can spray right from the bottle without mixing , pumping , or getting trigger finger cramps . You could certainly buy/mix any product and add it to your own manual/motorized spray , but this one comes ready to use all the way around . It 's nice to finish spraying without a red finger or cramps from constantly pressing the trigger.As for the motorized pump , essentially there is a small battery-powered pump in the spray handle . It works well and has decent trajectory . I tend to do a wide spray from a foot or two away anyway . The instructions say to prime the pump by holding the trigger for several seconds . I have found you need to hold it continuously for about a minute he first time you use the bottle . After that , there is spray in the hose and it comes out almost instantly . The cover for battery compartment is a little flimsy , so if you plan on reusing the bottle keep that in mind . Although the first set of batteries will probably last you several refills of the bottle.Deer Off II is similarly priced to other read-to-use products . It does cost a bit more than other sprays I use , only because I tend to use concentrates . This is a 64 ounce bottle , ready to use , whereas something like Deer Stopper concentrate costs about the same but is a 32 ounce bottle which mixes at a 9:1 ratio , so it yields 10 quarts , or 320 ounces - about 5 times more than Deer Off II . Neither product compares in price to home made spray which is just the cost of a few eggs and some chili powder , but again the home spray requires frequent respraying.If you do n't need to do constant spraying of a large area , or just ca n't be bothered with mixing concentrates or home ingredients , Deer Off II is a great solution.I would get this product again . It works well and is very convenient . The motorized spray is very nice when you are spaying a large amount of flowers , shrubs , etc .	1
I got this at a neighbor 's recommendation and I am glad I did . I live in Deer Country and it is not uncommon to see deer strolling on local lawns even in bright daylight . This is an effective product and deer are repelled by the taste . I was surprised that this product had the flavors of peppery egg , which deer and small rodents apparently do n't enjoy.Although this product has a bad smell , it is not overpowering and it does do the job . This does not have a strong odor and is not human repellent based on that.You get a motorized pupmp that runs on batteries . It does work well and it is easy to aim and spray . I would certainly recommend this . It is gentle on your foliage and other greenery .	1
Call me a skeptic but living here in the California Sierras , where deer ate all the rose bushes and some of the vegetable garden that wasnt fenced well enough , we have tried everything from soap hung on trees , a sprinkler set up that shoots water when a deer comes near ( creates an ice hazard in winter ) , and even a home brew of urine hot sauce and liquid soap . None worked well.This works ! ! The label says it has egg solids so if you have anyone who is allergic to eggs , do n't use it . Can not be used on food crops , but the vegetable garden is securely fenced so we are safe there . It was the newer rose bushes I was concerned about . You do have to reapply after it rains and its not as strong if the air is moist or you have snow on the ground.The container says it will repel deer , rabbits , tree squirrels , but it seems to repel skunks , and even opossums , and a neighbors dog . Do n't ask me how .	1
I sprayed this on my yard , not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof . So far , I ca n't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I have n't seen any squirrels running around in the general area . This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away . I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around .	1
I have been using this for a little while now and while it seems to work fairly well it only lasts a week without rain and if it rains you pretty much have to go out there the same day and reapply or you get to wake up first thing in the morning to your strawberries that hang near the fence being eaten ... It 's good idea for the most part but it 's something that just does n't really seem to be a lasting benefit and it seems to be a more natural avenue for repelling the deer and it does work just not nearly as long as I would like it to.I 've been using it for a couple month on the garden/around it to keep the unwanted animals away and it does seem to work pretty good so far , just as I said , it does n't last nearly as long as I would like it to .	1
The Deer Off II repellent with a battery powered sprayer is a great idea . It really does make it much easier to spray large areas . The Deer Off II repellent targets the deer , squirrel and rabbit 's sense of smell and taste . I have a rather large flower garden which the deer seem to think was planted for them . The Deer Off repellent has effectively kept them away for several weeks . It does need to be sprayed after each rainfall , but with the battery powered sprayer , that is no problem .	1
Great for protecting baby fruit/nut/landscape trees from deer rubs.We have a lot of property in GA , mostly timberland , but with some fruit/nut trees planted on some cleared land where we have a small hunting cabin . We 've tried a lot of different methods for keeping deer from rubbing all the bark off and killing the young trees -- this spray seems to be pretty effective . Just apply it around the time they start leaving rub marks , and trees stay safe , and alive . A little expensive , but a good option for those who do n't want to bother with physical measures like protective sheathing or fencing .	1
I bought this to try at my parents ' cabin . They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants , specfically tiger lillies and hostos ( or is it hostas ) .This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated . So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages ... I 'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this . It 's awful . But , then again many other chemical sprayers reek . Also , this is not a set it and forget option . You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply . Lastly , you can not use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it 's a new twist on an old concept . I 'd use it again .	1
Living near the woods , we have all kinds of critters : chipmunks , squirrels , rabbits , racoons , and deer . In addition there is my nutty dog , so I do n't want to use anything toxic around her . Deer Off has non toxic ingredients , and so far seems to repel the critters , though it 's still early in the season and I have n't yet planted my flowers due to the cold weather . I especially like that Deer Off does n't require mixing , an improvement over products I 've used in past years . So far so good , but I 'll update on effectiveness when my garden is planted .	1
I thought it was the rabbits , but then someone told me that rabbits do n't eat chrysanthemums ? Anyway , we realized that it was a doe and her super cute fawn . We sprayed just the flowers and bushes where they were having lunch . Now the deer are still playing out there in the back yard and the flowers are still in order .	1
I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees , it works pretty good . I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees . The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily , longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray . As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them , only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many .	1
UPDATE : I sprayed another round of Deer-Off on my chestnut tree trunks & the deer have avoided my trees ( no fresh bark rubbed off of the trunks ) . However , the Deer Off does not deter my squirrels , and , without hesitation , they scamper up the tree trunks to get the chestnuts._________________________________________________________________________So Far , So Good because it is n't prime rut season and , to me , this is the full test of a product because that is when the deer really tear up my 5-7 year old chestnut trees . Squirrels & Rabbits are not an issue until the nuts fall in September ( squirrels ) , so I can not comment on how the spray is a deterrent for these animals.We have a regular deer herd that hangs out on our property ( about 5-6 deer ) . They have been hard on my chestnut trees and , while , I want to be kind to nature , I really do n't want them eating my trees or rubbing on the tree trunks.Since it is late May , the deer have been fairly quiet , and , prior to the Deer Off , ate a few leaves ( especially on a newly planted chestnut - munched the top right off of it ) . I have not noticed any further activity , and have noticed that the deer seem to choose to stay over in neighboring properties rather than in our yard . However , rut will really put Deer Off to the test , so I will update this review after rut.As for the spray itself , the battery operated trigger ( batteries are included ! ) is great . After priming ( takes awhile ) , the spray is ready to go & puts out a nice , steady stream . The scent is not nasty , so the job of spraying is not bad at all.Deer Off is advertised as safe for use with kids & pets . My dogs have been in & around the sprayed trees & have exhibited no adverse reaction at all . They can tell there is some sort of a scent , so they sniff the trees.This product holds promise . The battery operated sprayer is nice & there was enough repellent to spray 8 trees with some left over .	1
I live on an acre lot in a rural subdivision . White-tail Deer are a daily nuisance inthe neighborhood and over the spring and summer , I used Deer Off to help protectazaleas , day lilies , and other ornamental plants around the yard.During this time deer continued to come into the yard on a regular basis but theydid not nibble on the treated plants nearly as much as when I left them untreated inearlier years.I sprayed three times in a six-month period through early fall with one extraspraying after three days of heavy rain . The battery-powered sprayer worked welland was easy to control . You do need to shake the container well before and duringuse so that the sprayer will not clog up . I had to unscrew the nozzle and clean it upa few times but that was n't a big problem . The product smells pretty bad as you arespraying , but the odor goes away quickly ( at least for humans ) once it dries.All in all Deer-Off is an effective product that will help keep deer from eating yourplants . Bear in mind that flowers and new growth that come out after you spray arenot treated and are subject to getting munched . You have to stay on top of thingsand spray after big rains as well .	1
The product works very well , just like many of the other reviewers have mentioned . We used to have deer coming to eat our plants and flowers quite often , almost on a daily basis . But with this repellent , we have n't had any issues.The one thing I did n't like was that product was n't shipped well - the cover had come loose and there was some spillage when I removed the product from the packaging . So beware when opening - the cover may not be closed all the way .	1
While the product only worked until it rained , the battery powered sprayer made respraying easier than other options . On the good side , having a periodic deterrent seems to discourage deer enough that they are getting less likely to come around . I actually have day lilies for the first time in years . Squirrels are a different matter and I need to keep up the respraying consistently if I want them away from my birdfeeders . I just do n't have to respray all around the gardens every time.The container comes with a sprayer in the 'holster ' which attaches under the cap . After opening the container the first time , you put the hose of the sprayer down in the container and close it with the hose 's cap through which the hose is threaded . The holster does a great job of holding the sprayer when not in use . The unit comes with batteries installed and is ready for use . It takes as much as 30 seconds to 'prime ' the sprayer when pressing the trigger at first , but not so long during subsequent applications . You can adjust the spray from a fine mist for nearby application to more of a stream if spraying something further away.I spray around my birdfeeders where it 's easy to see how effective the product is and sure enough , no squirrels come to the area for several days . When it rains , however , they were back . The birds are n't deterred at all , but my dog is . He does n't like the scent any better than the squirrels apparently . I did n't find the scent to be a problem for me while spraying though.Unlike the granules , which I also tried , this method is more cost effective as I can get many applications from the one large container . For deer of course the granules are n't very useful as I 've found I really need to actually spray the foliage the deer would be inclined to eat . I 've tried dozens of deer deterrents and although some are as effective ( like the rosemary oil spray ) , I really do like this battery operated approach as I have rather a lot to spray . For the squirrels and night critters , I just like the ease of use this product offers . If it worked longer , I 'd give it five stars , but so far I do n't mind reapplication too much .	1
This product was easy to set up and start using . The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze . Fortunately there are no deer in our area , but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden ... squirrels , rabbits , cats , and raccoons . I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good . The areas have not been dug up again ( which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused ) . I will update my results when more time has passed . I really like that this product is pretty much odorless . I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling . They not only kept the critters away , but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad .	1
I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away , now I have been spaying it around my straw garden . I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants . The sprayer works fine , and it does n't hurt pets or wildlife . You do have to spray again after it rains , but other than that , this has worked pretty well for me so far . The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging , but I have never bothered to do this . It has never clogged up on me . The product is made from eggs , but I have never really noticed any smell from using this .	1
Buying this product for the battery powered sprayer alone is worth it . The sprayer evenly and accurately applies a fine mist of Deer-Off without any leaks or drips . It can reach a couple of feet further into my plants than using a hand sprayer alone.The product itself is ok . It is basically cayenne , rosemary and garlic ( and other natural herb repellents ) suspended in a water resistant base containing egg whites . This base is what helps keep the herb-mixture stuck on to the plants to do their job . Does it work ? Yes , as well as applying cayenne and peppermint soap would . Does it have better staying power ? Yes , but only in light rain and light wind and not in a thunderstorm . I usually keep my dog away from my vegetable garden because I sprinkle cayenne , white pepper and peppermint soap on the leaves and around the border , so I have not actually tested to see if this is pet-friendly or not.After a few weeks , squirrels and bunnies are still staying away from my garden . The deer are still munching away but that may be because there 's a pack of them and a bite of each deer before they each decide to move on is destruction enough . The neighbourhood skunk that likes to dig around my stone wall has probably stopped coming around because there is n't any new stench.Overall it works as well as my homemade formula , is more convenient ( i.e . no mixing and fermenting ) and I really love the sprayer.Recommended .	1
This Havahart `` Deer Off II '' works better than expected at keeping squirrels from getting into my old Victorian house through the eaves . This has been a big problem for us in the past when we could hear them running around in the ceilings and having one die in the walls , causing us to shut off the room for over a week due to the smell . We also tested this on the flowerbeds in our front yard and it did keep the bunnies away as well , but we like the deer that come into our backyard so did not want to discourage them by spraying this where they tend to wander.This is very easy to use once you get the unit primed and the electric sprayer works well to apply it in hard to reach places , which was important for us since we had use it from a ladder . The odor is not as bad as expected , but it is definitely noticeable when applying the spray . This will have to be reapplied every few weeks , more often if there has been a lot of rain , but it is effective so we will keep using it as long as it works.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
If you have deer eating your vegetables and just pillaging your garden ( like us ) then this spray will help . The motorized spray is nice so you do n't need keep pumping a trigger . The order is n't to bad either I mean their is an order but no worse than other sprays . It will definitely work and to save your garden .	1
This time of year is tough on deer so they are a major threat to my expensive plants . They 're even munching on my trees and did their damage.Since applying this repellent , they 've not eaten anything . Only problem is having to reapply the repellent after it rains .	1
Great product to keep those pesky animals away from your plants and shrubs . It works ! Ease of use is the fact that it has a powered sprayer . This new technology is taking hold with other products like bug sprays and is making user friendly real !	1
I live in a rural area where deer abound aplenty . Every year there is a battle to see who can win- us with our plants and gardens , or deer with their insatiable appetites.We have been using Liquid Fence for quite a while with great results , but after a while of pressing the trigger over and over and over , it gets a bit tedious considering our garden and elderberry bushes are pretty extensive.This version of deer repellant is a bit different . The square container is about the size of an antifreeze container . There is a black cap that screws on top and a hose the comes out of it . There is a sprayer nozzle that attaches to the hose and that has batteries in it . The actual repellent is human safe so it can be used on gardens safely.It does tend to not have the severe garlic smell that some people find repulsive with Liquid Fence , but more of a calm scent which still does the trick.We just planted our garden this last month and that is when the deer often eat off all of our plants . We have been using this repellant and so far nothing has touched our plants.Application is a breeze . I just press down the nozzle and out comes the stream . I can make it softer or more precise and harder depending on what I need . My application time is cut way down now and I can quickly tour my yard spraying every week and I am free to spend more time on other things I would prefer to do.I highly recommend this stuff . It is wonderful . So far , no rabbit or deer problems with our garden and believe me there are plenty of both in our area . A few times of raining a week and it still works with weekly spraying if we have some serious rain .	1
I 'm pleased with the product itself . It 's a non-lethal way to get critters ( in my case , squirrels ) to come to the realization that next door is a much nicer place to be than in my backyard . The song birds who frequent my bird feeders also agree that `` someplace else '' is the absolute best place for squirrels to hang out.The smell is not too bad , but you certainly do n't want to be getting any on your clothes if you value the company of others . Note the wind direction before spraying ! The spraying part is where the product falls flat for me . It comes with a battery powered spray head . The spray head works provided that you prime it first and make sure that the batteries are seated properly ( they come with batteries packed in the sprayer , but they can get knocked about in transit ) .The problem is that this fancy spray head really does n't serve much good . It 's too weak for spraying large areas . For that you 'll want to use a garden pump sprayer ( you can get a cheap one for a few bucks at a home improvement store , or can invest in a really nice one such as this : Smith 190216 2-Gallon Max Contractor Sprayer With Heavy Duty 18-Inch Wand and Shoulder Strap ) A garden sprayer will allow you to efficiently cover a large swath without much effort.On the other hand , if you want to cover just a small area or be really precise , the battery spray head again falls short compared with a regular trigger dispenser . The battery version lacks fine-level control , and the spray pattern is either too wide or too narrow -- it 's hard to adjust the spray head to find the right middle ground . The only plus to the battery pump is that it is helpful if you have very limited hand strength.This is a worthwhile product , but skip the version with the battery sprayer and get the version that has a conventional sprayer ( or none at all ) .	1
I 've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective . I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures . I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard . This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents . It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you do n't have to mix it . Spray the plants as directed and forget it . The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience , this does not last for 3 months . I spray about every 6 weeks . Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away . The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas , plumeria , etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season .	1
I 've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it , so I thought I 'd give this a try.Since applying this product I 've seen deer in the area a few times , but they have n't even come into my yard . To be fair , it has n't rained since applying this , so I do n't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle . It did take longer to prime than what I expected , but it was a breeze to use once it was primed . Very easy on the hands . Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I 've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future .	1
My small garden had frequest visits from rabbits , squirrels , and other small pests . However , regular applications of the HAVAHART DEER OFF II stopped the night time visits cold . This was true even in the late fall when rain comes a little more frequently to the area - the DEER OFF II was not easily washed away and continued to protect my leafy greens.I also appreciated the battery-operated sprayer . As someone who easily gets hand cramps and forearm pain from typical pump sprayers , I was happy to pay a little extra for the battery-operated bottle . You do n't really have to use alot , depending on the size of your garden , but it made my hand very happy.This product was ideal all the way around - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! !	1
We wished there was a way to keep the rabbits out of our yard for several years now but we did n't know of a way to repel them . The problem is that the rabbits run through our yard leaving their pellets all over the place . Our dog thinks that it is food and it drives us crazy trying to keep our dogs away from it . I decided to give this a try but did n't have high hopes that it would work . I sprayed the perimeter of our entire yard well over a month ago and have n't seen a rabbit since then . I also have n't seen any more rabbit pellets so this seems to have worked very well . I was able to spray the entire perimeter of my yard and only used about a third of the bottle so one bottle should last the entire year.My only complaint is that the sprayer did n't want to work at first . I had to run hot water through it for several minutes before it started to spray . But once it get going the battery operated automatic spray is wonderful . My hand would have been tired by the time I was finished but with the automatic spray it was a breeze.Even considering the problem with the sprayer at first I think this is a really good product .	1
Egg white , Capsaicin , and Garlic are 5 % of the product , who knows what else ... There are no indications that the product is non-toxic but I expect it is . There are only warning about irritation if it gets in your eyes . This is expected as Capsaicin is the hot in a hot pepper.I would like to see more information about how and where the product is safe . It should be safe around birds , but is it ? As packaged the primary recommend use is to protect seedlings from getting nibbled , and it seems to work well in that regard.I would like to use it around my bird feeders to fend off the squirrels there as well.The battery powered sprayer is a great addition to this type of product . Powered by 4 AA batteries , it is n't a power sprayer and your old fashioned pump sprayer will beat it easily . However for quick spot applications the battery power is sufficient to do the job . The spray itself is a good balance between too light of a mist and a washout dripping product . A couple seconds on each plant was enough to get good coverage and the large capacity jug will easily last the season .	1
And they were eating everything in our yard and garden . Our fruit trees , blueberry bushes , raspberries , creeping phlox and Asian lilies seem to be their favorite plants to chew on and sometimes destroy completely . I sprayed them all down with Deer Off and the only plant I 've noticed new nibbling on is my creeping phlox , and I 'm not sure why it 's not working for that plant.The battery powered sprayer makes it so easy on my hands ( I have arthritis ) and the smell was n't as noticeable as some other things I 've tried . So far it seems to be working well , and I 'm hoping that keeping my fruit trees and berries sprayed this winter will keep the rabbits from girdling them.The label states not to use on garden plants that you will consume , so I sprayed the perimeter of my wooden garden boxes , but that did n't repel the rabbits and squirrels at all . I even have a 14 inch tall hardware cloth fence around two of my garden boxes , but I still have problems with some kind of varmint getting in and eating all the sugar peas . Any suggestions would be appreciated !	1
So far so good ! ! ! Even after the rain for two days the deer are leaving my plants and shrubs alone finally ... easy spray with the battery powered sprayer so my arthritic hands did not give out spraying . A great product from Amazon at great price that actually deters the critters . You will have to try this to see how easily it works . ( Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabitt , and Squirrell Ready-to-Use Repellant with Battery Powered Sprayer )	1
I still have all my flowers out front so it must be working . It has a mild smell when first sprayed but dries up and becomes odorless fairly quickly . It does n't bother my dog though as he still walks up to the bushes to urinate on them , so dogs , or at least him , must not be bothered by it . I use this in combination with the Havahart Solar Powered Water Sprinkler in my backyard raised garden bed and so far so good . If you have trouble with rabbits , deers , and squirrels , give it a try . It 's safe around humans and pets . I recommend it .	1
I 've had this on the plants for about a week now and so far I have seen less damage from the deer . That might be somewhat seasonal , so I 'll have to watch and see over the long term how effective this is . I 've also sprayed it around the trash cans to keep the raccoons away and it has been effective at that too . I can certainly smell it myself , so this is not something you 'll want to spray onto plants near a door or window . Thanks to the powered spayer , it is easy to apply . In that regard I think this would be an excellent product for anyone with limited strength or mobility . I can definitely see this as being helpful for an older person with a lot of property or greenery who has a critter problem .	1
I have used the granule version of this product and had great success , so I thought I would give the spray version of it a try . The spray version seems to work as well as the granules and goes a little further since you can control the spray much easier than pouring the granules . This product keeps animals out of my yard , and I have seen a less number of dreaded armadillos digging my yard up . The spray also helps with dogs and other animals , as they do not seem to like it and it seems to keep them away ( added bonus ) . What makes this even better is the battery powered sprayer ( if you have ever used a pump sprayer , you know how terrible these spray containers are ) . This battery powered sprayer is super easy and you just pull the trigger . It worked great ! ! ! It even says that it is reusable and fits most gallon size containers . So once you finish with the Deer Off you have a sprayer that you can continue to use on other tasks ( I see a future for my weed killer ) . This is a great package , you get the deer off which seems to keep all critters out of my yard , and a reusable sprayer that can be used with my other yard chores ! I am very happy with this and have had a significant decline in armadillos in my yard ( also less wandering dogs ) ! ! !	1
We 've had continual issues with deer , rabbits , squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers , vegetables and fruit . We 've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets . I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell . I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers , several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry . The deer seem to be repelled , with no evidence of any damage from them . On the negative side , the chipmunks are n't deterred at all . They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note , the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping . The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking , but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try . If you 're trying to control chipmunks , do n't waist your time .	1
works great , smells bad great dispenser . If you have a smaller garden this is what you want.I often use a much larger back pack sprayer , but this is much easier .	1
We had a woodchuck last year , a big woodchuck , that decided to set up camp in our backyard . She ( I believe it is a she ) ate everything she could get to , nothing was safe . Thankfully the vegetable garden had a fence but we lost half of our unfenced flower garden . As soon as things started sprouting this year I started spraying but not what I thought was excessive . We have not seen our big friend in our garden this year but I did see her in a neighbors yard the other day so I 'm hoping it was the Havahart Deer Off and not that she moved to a better neighborhood.We do n't have a problem with rabbits or deer and the only issue we have with squirrels is they like to bury nuts in our garden and flower boxes in the fall , so we will see how it goes with them later in the year . The sprayer works well and I 'm really interested to see how long the pump lasts and will update as to that also . Recommended .	1
My property by the hillside attracts many critters scavenging for food during the hot , dry months . The main pests are wild hares , mice , gophers , and on rare occasions , a deer . This Deer Off II was sprayed on foliage along the slope behind my backyard while I usedHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent , 5-Pounds Granular Shakerin my front/backyards for combined repelling in two zones . The motorized sprayer is simple and useful but does take a minute or two to prime up ( fill with liquid repellent ) during initial use . After two weeks , I have n't seen an critters during daylight hours and there are less burrowed holes on the ground . I do appreciate this sample but $ 32.53 for 1/2 gallon ( 64oz . ) of liquid repellent is rather costly . The manufacturer claims of covering over 1000 sq . ft. and lasting 3 months per one application remains to be seen . The putrid scent of rotten eggs may deter rodents and herbivores but might actually attract scavengers like crows , coyotes , and skunks . Overall : good critters deterrent to keep them off my property but questionable long term effectiveness .	1
We had a deer nibbling on our garden , she snacked on the cucumber plant , corn and peas . We sprayed this on the garden and she has n't been eating anything lately but it is hard to tell for sure because she had a fawn and once the fawn was big enough she is venturing further away so she just might not be coming to the garden any more ? That is why I am not positive it is the product that is working or if she just changed her pattern of travel .	1
I had always avoided buying Deer Off because of its price -- I always make my own repellent in the kitchen -- but the motorized sprayer attracted me to this version of the product . I have 1.5 acres , and protecting all the susceptible plants and shrubs with my home brew and a spray bottle gets tiring . The Havahart combination of deer/squirrel/rabbit repellent and a motorized sprayer makes treatment MUCH easier as well as effective.First , the results : Most of my plant damage comes from deer and groundhogs , although rabbits also get their teeth on some of the more tender plants . Since this can not be used on vegetable gardens ( you do n't want to taste this stuff ! ) , I treated the shrubs and plants the deer tend to munch on . I had previously triedHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent , 5-Pounds Granular Shakerwith mixed results . I applied this product on the areas that were still getting eaten . Twenty-four hours after I applied Deer Off , I actually saw a deer back away from a garden without a nibble . Success ! I also know from using a home brew that the deer that dare taste leaves treated with repellent tend to leave the plant alone in the future , even after the repellent wears off , which makes this longer lasting than expected or even advertised . Obviously , new deer that come onto my property have n't had this same taste experience , so plants can be vulnerable after a couple of months . Whereas the Critter Ridder discouraged animals from trying new snacks , it did n't deter them from old pleasures since it does n't alter the taste of them . This spray does taste bad to them -- and for that reason , it works really well.Second , the application : The motorized sprayer comes with two AA batteries , already installed . You need to shake the bottle , replace the original cap with the one at the base of the sprayer assembly , unlock the nozzle , squeeze the trigger , and you 're applying the repellent . The sprayer does need to be primed the first time . Instead of the several seconds I expected , it took almost a full minute to get the stuff through the tube the first time . In fact , it took so long that I removed the sprayer to check for holes or crimps in the tubing . I was convinced that something was wrong despite the motorized sound . Be patient ! After the first priming , you do n't have to wait that long again.Third , the specifics : This repellent is basically putrified eggs , garlic , and hot pepper . The egg smell drives animals away , and the hot pepper and garlic , while adding to the nasty smell , serve as taste repellents as well . This does not smell as bad as mine on application , and I can not detect much of a scent after it dries . If you or anyone in your household has an allergy to eggs , do not apply . Because of the hot pepper , it will burn if you get it in your eyes.Pros : Sprayer works well once primed ; repellent actually works over the course of 2-3 months ; relatively mess-free , unless you apply on a breezy day.Cons : Price per ounce compared to a similar home brew ; you ca n't use it on vegetable gardens.If you want a ready-to-apply deer repellent that comes with an easy-to-use spray applicator , this product is great . More frugal homeowners may wish to mix their own from concentrate or create their own. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
I live in the suburbs so do n't have problems with deer or even coyotes , but rabbits , squirrels and mice seem to think my back yard is a Grand Central Station for rest , food and play -- and this is with a dog . The dog , however , is a very gentle wolfhound and they all seem to know she is n't going to spoil their fun or dinners . I saw the Deer Off on the Amazon Vine program for review and thought I 'd try it.First off , I had no trouble using the product . The battery powered sprayer was easy to use and pretty precise in terms of my directing the liquid . The smell is quite , um , odorous . So therefore , I waited until my neighbor went on vacation before I sprayed between our houses . She keeps her windows open I felt she would appreciate the smell just about as much as the rabbits , squirrels and mice . Good call on my part as the stuff really does smell.Now as to whether it works . I put the stuff on the side of the house where the squirrels like to convene to chat , play and court one another . I put more of the stuff in the back yard gardens where the bunnies seem to think the adjoining flower gardens are theirs for the munching . And finally I put some under the deck where I have seen some mice . No point in making them feel welcome to expand their territory and enter the house.I have seen far fewer squirrels dancing around the side of the house . Normally they run up the tree across the roof ( either mine or the neighbors ) walk along the fence and generally eat any bulb I plant ! As far as the back yard gardens go , the nibbling on the plants does seem to be less frequent . One side benefit for me is that my dog is a digger and she does n't seem to like the smell and has decided not to dig in the places I sprayed . This is well worth the price of the Deer Off and when I run out I 'll definitely buy more if it will keep her from digging . My back yard sometimes looks like a grenade or land mine exploded with all of her holes . As far as the mice go ? Well , they are n't in the house !	1
I have lots of mulched areas in my yard . After using Havahart Deer Off II , I have noticed that the squirrels and rabbits do not go near those sprayed areas . It is wonderful to not have to clean up the mulch everyday ... and plants can continue to grow ! The sprayer was amazingly simple to use with the battery powered sprayer and it takes much less effort than using a hand triggered device . I do n't have any deer around my property , so I ca n't address its effectiveness in keeping them at bay , but it sure worked for repelling the other critters . I 'm looking forward to spring !	1
We have a ton of wild bunnies where I live and I love to grow green beans . Unfortunately , the bunnies love the green bean plants too . I was having a worse than usual year where they were chewing my beans down to the ground regularly . I got the Deer Off and , guess what , I have green bean plants again ! It has completely stopped them from eating my plants . I also love the battery powered sprayer . My garden is decent sized and other sprayers make my hand sore by the time I 'm done which makes me less likely to use the product as often as I should . With this , I just hold the trigger down and it does all the work . My only complaint is that it washes away when I water or it rains so I 'm out there every single day applying the Deer Off . If it rains or I water and do n't do it , the bunnies are back snacking on my green bean plants .	1
Easy enough to apply and not messy.In order to test it 's effectiveness we not only applied this to our own trees but with the permission of one of our neighbors we applied it to two of her trees as well . This was two months ago and I have to admit that all the trees that were treated with this product were avoided by the deer . Including our neighbors two trees , while her other trees and bushes were chewed on instead . I suppose it will remain to be seen how long it will last over all , I 'm sure we got the mileage we did because of the extended dry weather we experienced her in Wyoming this summer . Moisture I 'm sure would wash away the Deer-off rather quickly otherwise.This bottle contained enough to cover 8 trees and 4 small shrubs . In a dry climate one dose can last up to two months , however I 'm sure that in a wetter climate multiple re-applications would be necessary .	1
The product is easy to apply . I use it around some raised planters , the garden , and our dryer vent which leaves the house only about 8 inches above the ground ( we 've gotten critters in it before ) . It does seems to work ( for us on rabbits ) as the plant damage is lessened in the raised planters and garden . Our yard is fenced so deer are not a problem and I could n't test it on them . This summer the product lasts longer as it was extremely dry . I do reapply after it rains otherwise it loses it effect . Good to use/try if exposed plants are getting visits by rabbits .	1
Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town . I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees . Other than that , I love to see them wandering around . I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs , they work , but my poor hands pay the price after applying them . When I saw this product with the battery powered spray , I had to have it . It works and my hands no longer suffer . What 's not to love ?	1
I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here . I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife 's plants . This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries . The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle . No more pumping my old sprayer . The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray . Lightweight is good . Most importantly , it did not kill my wife 's plants or the woodland creatures . Also , the battery operated sprayer is reusable . I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out , but I think the half gallon will last awhile . This is a great product .	1
We live in a wooded area in Wisconsin . Our woods begin where our lawn ends with the nearest house 1/2 mile away . We have had `` issues '' with deer , bear , coyotes , raccoons and little ones like rabbits and gophers . We 've tried moth balls , pepper , red pepper flakes , etc . Nothing really worked on a consistent basis.It is nice to see deer in the yard but my goal is to keep them away from our flower beds and trees . Just a few days before we applied this a group of 4 deer were munching away on a tree we had just planted . Our flowers are often grazed on also , particularly our lilacs.What impressed me right off the bat was the sprayer , first off the batteries were installed so we could go right to work and second it comes with a holster on the container . The sprayer works great , you can adjust the spray and it sprays about two feet.The product does seem to work . The plants and trees this was sprayed on have been fine for about a week . There is really no concrete way to know for sure , we have gone weeks with no problems with no product used and then have had deer using our yard as a person feeding station.While I realize this is an expensive product I do not think you have to do more than a spray or two on foliage for it to work and given what a four or five foot tree costs and how depressing it is to find it stripped for leaves , not to mention flowers , it is worth it .	1
My home is located about half way between where the deer reside and the lake that they like to visit . They usually stop by here to munch on my wife 's hosta plants . When the deer are not enjoying the hostas there are rabbits that like to do the same . I have used various types of sprays but none have been effective in keeping the uninvited guests away from the hostas . I decided to give Deer Off a try in hopes of rescuing what was left of the plants.Deer Off comes in a fairly standard battery powered sprayer that is similiar , if not identical , to sprayers available at Lowes . I have purchased a number of these types of sprayers with insect killer and other types of contents . The Deer Off sprayer was easy to setup . The batteries were already installed so all that was required was to remove the storage/shipping cap and replace it with the cap with the attached hose . It takes a short time , perhaps 10 or so seconds , to prime the pumping action and a reasonably forceful spray is available to apply to the plants . There have been no unwelcome visitors since I sprayed the hostas so 5 stars is warranted . The battery operated sprayer makes treatment easy and the contents are effective plus I got an attaboy from the hostas owner . It 's all good .	1
We live on a 7+ acre area in the mountains . It is a haven for deer . Unfortunately , with deer come deer ticks . It creates a risk for my family and my dog . I found this product to be quite effective in spraying the immediate area around my house and part of the yard.The sprayer is relatively lightweight and not cumbersome to operate . The unique delivery method of this device is the use of a battery powered sprayer . If you 've ever done extensive spraying , you can find my fingers getting pretty tired after just a few minutes . This method alleviates that.The smell of the solution is quite strong so I had to put this in the periphery of the yard . My dog did n't even like the smell , and neither did I . With the frequent rain and snow that we have had , it has n't lasted as long as I would have expected ( roughly 2 months ) .Considering that this is roughly a $ 200 per year treatment ( 6 times a year ) , I need to see if there are more economical solutions.Overall , though , I 'm pleased with the results . The family of deer that sleep on my lawn are no longer there . Maybe they 're at the neighbors ? Hahahahahahahahahahaha	1
I used this product on and around a bird feeder to keep the squirrels away . So far they are staying away . There were some things I liked and did n't like about this product.First the things I liked : This product is made from natural products such as garlic and pepper . I feel much better about using this in my yard , rather than toxic chemicals . Also , it really was easy to use , once the spray started flowing . However I did have to leave the battery-powered spraying mechanism on for approximately a minute before the product began spraying.The one thing I did not like : The directions say to remove the batteries and dry them off before using . When I did this I discovered two of the four batteries were leaking and corroded . Not a pleasant surprise in a new product . After I replaced them , the product did work , however when a product says `` batteries included , '' I assume they mean non-leaking , functional batteries ! Also the spray mechanism and battery compartment door seem of cheap quality , so I 'm not sure if the spraying mechanism will last long enough to use up all the product.However , overall I am pleased to have an environmentally friendly product to keep four-legged critters away from my bird feeder and garden .	1
The Havahart Deer Off Ready-To-Use Repellant applied a lot of repellent quickly . It was easy to set the direction of the spray . The battery option was a great addition to spraying to keep the deer from eating and/or trampling our plants and it made the application process a lot easier . It appears to work well as there has been no damage of plants after the first application.On the other hand , there was no wand with our bottle of repellant which made it impossible to apply a fine mist/spray ( packaging implied it should have been part of what we received ) . The bottom compartment was hard to open and the nozzle we had to use because of having no wand dripped while applying.Update : This spray is doing a fantastic job of keeping the squirrels out of the birdfeeders .	1
I live in an area with lots and lots of deer . They consider our landscaping to be a private salad bar , eating the more delectable perennials right down to ground level . I tried a lot of different deer repellents , none of which worked very well . I spoke with a fellow who runs a nursery about half a mile from my house . I figured he must have a solution to protect his thousands of bedding plants . He swore by Deer Off . I tried it , and it really did keep the deer from eating my landscaping plants . The only problem was that it was inconvenient to mix and apply the product . So I was eager to try this ready-to-use version that comes with its own sprayer . I can report that it 's super convenient , and the sprayer works well . Convenience is important , since inconvenience means procrastination , and procrastination means chomped plants.On the downside : This is a more expensive way to buy Deer Off , and the sprayer requires batteries . I wish it were a pump sprayer , but based on experience with similar products I 'm guessing the batteries will last a long time , so no big deal . You could achieve the same result by buying the concentrate and a pump sprayer , and leaving the sprayer filled with Deer Off . That would probably be a more efficient solution if you have a lot of plants , but this package is convenient for smaller areas .	1
There are at least two things I like about the Deer Off repellant product produced by Havahart [ ... ] . First it is applied using a battery operated nozzle which avoids acquiring carpel tunnel syndrome by repeated hand-squeezing to keep the spray going.Second is that the product uses odors to repel deer , squirrels and rabbits instead of chemicals that could permanently harm these pests . I just want to keep them out of my garden , not kill them . The odors are produced from the active ingredients of putrescent whole egg solids and garlic Putrescent whole egg solids is a distinct smell that mimics the smell of a dead animal and alerts nuisance animals that a predator might be nearby . In addition to creating a bad scent , Deer Off also relies on garlic and hot pepper substances to cause a taste irritation to stop deer , rabbits and squirrels from feeding on plants and foliage.The Deer Off scent dissipates and dries odorless to humans while keeping animals away from the protected area , up to three months according to the manufacturer ( I 'd be happy with one month ) . Because all-natural products are used this repellent will not harm pets , children or adults . One-half gallon of the repellent is enough to treat some 100 shrubs four-feet or taller or 1,000 square feet of garden area.Now that I can keep squirrels out of my garden I can concentrate on keeping them off my bird feeders .	1
Hey , the deer around here are as thick as flies -- it is hard to keep the deer out of the yard and garden -- this product is one of the few things I found that has a chance of working . It is easy to use with the battery-powered sprayer , too .	1
This is so easy to use wtih very little effort becasue of the battery powered sprayer . It works well to protect your veggie garden or flower garden from the bunnies , squirrels , and deer . It even kept the pesky ducks from the park next door away from my veggies . Last a long time . Remember to reapply after heavy rain .	1
We have lots of deer in our area and they will try to eat almost everything . I have used this on Fusicas , which deer really love , and they wo n't touch them . The battery powered sprayer makes this a little less messy to use as well as sparing the hands from pumping a sprayer .	1
I live in Montana , and it is fairly common to see deer in your yard , even in town . It 's not really a big deal except they do eat your fruits and vegetables sometimes , and they do leave the occasional mess . At my house , the problem was more with the squirrels . We have a lot of wildlife around my home , and the squirrels ( I think ) are always eating from my various fruit plants . It may be deer , I am not sure . However , I sprayed the problem area and surrounding areas with the Deer Off and it seemed to do the trick . Fruit has n't been missing and I have seen less and less signs of unwanted animal activity during the night . Again , I am not exactly sure what animal I am repelling , I assume it is squirrels , but if you have any problem with deer , squirrels , or rabbits getting in your yard and bothering your plants , try this out . I think it is also available in smaller sizes if you are n't ready to commit to this large size .	1
The rabbits had me at my wits end having destroyed a large section of a newly sodded lawn . The rabbits were having their way with me and I was losing the battle . I started using Deer Off , reseeded the bare sections , and now my lawn is green again . The `` power '' nozzle makes spraying a large area a snap allowing me to cover the perimeter of the lawn quickly . A single treatment lasts about three to four days or until we have a rain . At the first sign of the little vermin I get out the sprayer and re-apply Deer Off . I might be applying it a little sooner than really needed but when I see the first rabbit droppings I do a new application.I like it much better than the other product I was using because it does not have to be mixed and does not leave my clothes and hands with an awful odor .	1
I was interested in trying this product to keep the deer away from the hostas in my yard . In reading and re-reading the product description here at Amazon , I could n't find out what was in it . I 'm allergic to capsaicin ( chili peppers ) , and I 've had allergic reactions to animal repellents in the past , so I needed to know if this product has any capsaicin . Fortunately , the product description includes a toll free number to call for more information . The customer service representative on the other end of the line was extremely helpful . She told me Deer Off contains not only capsaicin , but also egg solids and garlic . So if you 're allergic to eggs , capsaicin , or garlic , you should n't use this product . She suggested I try another Havahart product , Defense , instead , which has eggs , but no capsaicin.So , while I did n't get to try Deer Off because of my allergies , I found Havahart Customer Service quite polite as well as informative and helpful . But since this product contains food ingredients , the foods should be listed here on the product description page so that people with food allergies can easily tell what 's in it before ordering it . In general , if you have food allergies , especially to eggs or spices , always check the ingredients of animal repellents before using them in your yard .	1
The battery-operated Havahart DO64MS Deer Off sprayer seems useful for those with weak hands , but at an additional cost of replacement batteries . This all-natural organic formula repels by taste and odor deer , rabbits , squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control , e.g . rabid . This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks , but rather for the suburban home and garden use . Its garlic , putrescent egg , and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens , lawns , and landscaped areas , but also some basements , cellars , and storage .	1
First thing I did when getting this , was something that the instructions do n't mention : spray along the perimeter of where you do n't want the deer in . Kind of attempting to use it as an invisible fence . That did n't work . Do n't buy it if that 's your intention.Then I tried using it how you 're supposed to : spray it directly on the plants that you do n't want the deer to eat . And ... the deer have n't eaten anything ( yet ... it 's been a week or so now . ) So , it looks like it works . However , it rains a lot here in the PacNW , and I 'm pretty sure the amount of rainfall is going to wash away the protection pretty easily ... so for me , a physical barrier ( a circle of metal fencing around my fruit trees ) is a bit more practical for my uses.However , if you are trying to protect a wider swath of plants all bunched up , then this will likely work well for you - spray it even over everything in the bunch and the deer will keep away ... Or if you have individual larger plants that are focus points of your yard ( and thus , do n't want fencing surrounding this ) , then this is also a great solution.Overall - it works , but make sure it 's really what you want first . Recommend in most cases ... just not mine .	1
When we were having problems w/ squirels scavenging and mucking around our backyard , we used this product . As far as I can tell , since we used the product , we have n't had any issues w/ squirrels and they have n't come back for quite some time even though we have n't sprayed again for many weeks .	1
Havahart Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit And Squirel Ready to use repellent is excellent . I really like the sprayer , just add batteries and go . I have problems with my hand so this was great for me . No more pumping . So far I have had it around my plants for a few days and I have no deer or rabbit problems which I had before.Hopefully it will continue to work .I am one happy camper ! ! ! You should give it a try .	1
This contains the same ingredients as dog repellant , and it works on a large variety of animals , not just deer , rabbits , and squirrels . This white milky liquid contains rotten eggs , hot pepper , and garlic . It does n't smell much to humans when you apply it , so I was able to use it around the garden close to the house without any noticeable after effects . I never liked battery operated disposable sprayers , though . It works fine , but I could have sprayed it faster with more power if it was manually operated .	1
I can not vouch for its effect on any other animals , but this product worked quite nicely in keeping squirrels away from bird feeders . After application squirrels that had ignored all other attempts to scare them away refused to even try to climb the trees and posts I sprayed.Note : The battery powered sprayer is a nice touch though it will be more appreciated by people with larger areas to spray than I had .	1
We have had a problem with squirrels chewing through our electric line that controls the motor for our retractable awning . The repair was quite expensive . The motor and lines are adjacent to a rain gutter and the squirrels made a nest near the motor using materials including the fabric on our outdoor furniture . I really enjoy the little rascals and did n't want to do them any harm , but finding an organic repellents is n't an easy task . This product is made by Havahart , the company known for its humane critter traps . The unit is a blessing because it has a battery powered sprayer and it is ready to use . There is no mixing of chemicals and it does not need to be attached to a garden hose , etc . The batteries are included . For those with large areas to protect , the hand grip is very comfortable . Each application is supposed to last three months . Since we just got this unit , only time will tell if our electric cable will deter the critters . The active ingredients include `` Putrescent Whole Egg Solids , Capsaicin and Related Capsaicinoids , Garlic ... ''	1
I 'm pretty much a live and let live neighbor to the deer who live on our block . They were here first and they have n't caused me any trouble.I feel differently about squirrels.The important part of the product description of this was the squirrel repellant . We have had a 26 foot sailboat stored by our barn for about 6 years now and have recently uncovered it to start surveying what we needed to do to get it operational for our teenager by next summer . While it was covered , a rather large extended family of squirrels seems to have moved in and made themselves at home.When we opened up the boat , they all scurried out the way they came - through cowl vents . As soon as we left , they moved back in . We did n't want to close up the cowl vent and have them eat through fiberglass to get back in . They probably could n't do it but trying would do enough damage.Then we tried Havahart . I trust Havahart around the pets . We scared the squirrels out again ; then we sprayed the tree branches above the sailboat and the cradle below it . It 's really easy to apply . So far the squirrels stay away as long as the application is good . But it 's kind of like using sun tan lotion on the beach . It needs to be reapplied when it gets soaked or snowed on . ( Snow hardly ever happens on the beach . But you know what I mean . )	1
We built a home that is near a protected wildlife area and had a real problem ( yard is unfenced ) with deer , rabbits , and not sure what other wildlife , munching down our landscaping pretty much constantly . Fencing would ruin the natural setting we enjoy , but we were definitely losing the landscape wars before we found this repellant spray . After the first application we noticed a lot less damage , and now that we got real thorough with the coverage of the spray , we have NO nibbles at all - plus it keeps the wildlife deposits ( dung ) away from the house . Recommended !	1
Since I live near Yosemite national park , I get allot of deer.Deer off is ready to use right from the bottle , which comes with a battery operated sprayer you put into the Deer offbottle . This is very easy to use..Although I do find it does NOT go very far , or I 'm spraying too much of it on a few of my plants.I wanted Deer Off for my Organic Veggies.It does say , '' For Organic Gardening '' in very little wording ! But it does not say it can be used on Veggies ! It says , `` Do not allow spray to drift onto plants intended for human consumptions ! Since it says it is Organic , this is a bit confusing , and I 'm dissapointed.I did spray it on a few plants I have that the Deer have been eating , and the Deer have NOT been eating those plants . Which I 'm very happy about.It does say to use it very 2 to 3 months , or more often during periods when rain occurs.I used it every night for 4 days , and as I said , the Deer have stayed away.This contains egg solids which may cause allergic reactions in some individuals..Do not apply at temperatures below 40 degrees , or when wet , or windy conditions.It does have a stinky small , which I 'm sure is what keeps the Deer away.So far , I 'm happy with this product , but disapointed , I ca n't use it on my veggies.I now put chicken wire over , or around my veggies , and put tin-foil on at night over some of my other veggies.The Deer do not like the tin-foil , and can not get through the chicken wire..I would buy this again for my other plants that the deer eat .	1
I 've used this product for a few weeks . We 've had a terrible time with animals eating our new plantings this year . We put out rose bushes , weigela , and spirea bushes this Spring , and I was at my wits end . I tried this , and it has helped . My advice to you is to try this product along with everything else and see what works . That 's what I did , and the combination really helped .	1
My mother is a senior citizen who has a lot of trouble with deer and rabbits eating her plants . She always plants lot of daffodils because they do n't seem to eat those . This product is easy for her to use and it seems to be working .	1
We have been using this product to keep the gophers out of our garden . We live on a farm and it really gets to be a problem . This product is quick and easy to use . The sprayer works well and felt like good quality.This did so well at keeping the gophers ( we call them rock chucks here ) out that we sprayed a wide perimeter around the chicken coop to see if we can keep the skunks out . Last year we lost 10 chickens to skunks . So far , so good . I know that we have had skunks in the are but none have attempted to get my chickens so I am pretty happy about that .	1
We have a 900 square foot garden that my husband and I own & run on our church property in an urban area . I 've been really fearful that the little rabbits are going to completely demolish our vegetables this year , things have barely started sprouting but they 've already helped themselves to our spinach sprouts . We also see the burrowing holes they 've started all over . The land our garden sits on is very large , and there is a LARGE rabbit population there . They are also very bold , and will come within 10 feet of us while we 're working there.So , needless to say I was excited to try out this repellent . After just one use we saw the burrow holes stop , and rabbits seemed to keep themselves at more of a distance . It 's spring now , so I will say that reapplying after the rain might get to be tedious , but it will be worth it . I really do think this product works.It 's also easy to use , and does n't really smell like much of anything to us . It feels like a safe product to use . We do n't even spray it directly on our plants , we just go around the perimeter of our garden as well as very close to some highly sought after plants ( like the spinach ) . I ca n't say if it works for deer or other pests , but as rabbits have been our setback , I CAN say that this repellent seems to work beautifully for that . Will update if this changes ! Definitely recommended for now .	1
UPDATE Dec. 22 , 2012 : Do not let the solution freeze ; it will no longer be viable . Says so in the instructions.Squirrels are our problem . We have huge 100+-year-old pecan , magnolia and oak trees in our yard . We also have a few fig trees . The squirrels do a lot of damage : They eat bark , they tear off small limbs and bunches of leaves , they pester the bird nests , they eat pecans and they eat figs . We 've never seen them eat anything in our gardens , although we 're forever digging out young pecan trees that sprout up from the nuts they 've buried and forgotten . Just in the past 5 months we have live-trapped about 50 of them ( lured them into the trap with last year 's pecans ... ) .So I got this product to try out an idea I had : To spray the tree trunks , part-way up . I was hoping to prevent the squirrels from getting into the trees . Last weekend I sprayed the trunks from a half-foot off the ground and up about 4-5 feet.This weekend I 've been sitting on our front veranda and I 've been watching for squirrels . Last weekend they were bothering the momma birds and their nests in the magnolia trees . There are quite a few nests in these two giant trees . Last weekend the birds were kept pretty busy chasing off the squirrels and they made quite a bit of racket bickering back and forth , each in their own language.So , what did I observe this weekend ? No squirrels in the magnolia trees -- not a single one . I guess there could be other reasons for the squirrels to have disappeared from the front yard , and I guess that the squirrels will still be able to access our trees by jumping from our neighbor 's trees , but all in all , my verdict is that this product works just fine.I also like the battery-operated sprayer . For my long , slender fingers the nozzle could be more ergonomically correct and the trigger could be a little softer , but the concept is great and I appreciate the fact that I do n't have to continually stop and pump up the pressure . Our own big sprayer is a decent one and stays pressurized for quite a while , but our small sprayers lose their pressure quickly -- and this is a small job . So , I was glad to have this feature . My husband sprayed the plastic fencing that he has surrounded the fig trees with and he reports that the nozzle gun feel great in his larger hand and better-padded fingers.UPDATE , June 25 , 2012 : Our figs are getting big and several weeks ago we drove some metal stakes and surrounded two trees with plastic fencing to keep the squirrels out . They 're not huge trees yet and we 'd kind of like to get to eat some of the fruit ... Well , I guess we overestimated the size of the squirrels and they were getting right through the holes . When we saw them inside the fence , we sprayed the fence with this product . Great news ! The squirrels have been stymied ! NOTE : It is imperative that you re-spray after a heavy rain . We do n't get much rain where we 're located so that 's not too big a problem for us .	1
I found that the motorized spray works great for me . It is a lot easier to use than a squirt bottle as I am spraying the perimeter of my back yard and parts of my front flower beds . I started a square foot garden this year and immediately had issues with rabbits coming in the back of my yard to eat a variety of green things . After spraying with Deer Off II , I have n't seen any damage from rabbits . Our area has squirrels , too , but as yet I have n't had problems with those.I suspect that I will need to reapply fairly often so I will update this review if I find the rabbits back or the squirrels coming to visit .	1
This was so simple to use , comes with batteries installed in handle , shake it up and spray away . I have animal cameras in my yard so I know this really worked on the rabbits , I sprayed the base of my fruit trees , the edge of my whole yard at the base of the fence ( 1/2 acre ) and the garden.The rabbits which were everywhere this year for some reason , they left , I did not see a rabbit for over two weeks after spraying , a squirrel who had just built a huge winter nest also left . I have not seen a deer in months so I ca n't say how it works on them yet , but the farmers should be pulling in the crops soon and than the deer start to come out more . Have to update on them later . I also get raccoons , opossum , skunk , ground hogs , and fox . After spraying they seem very interested and do a lot of sniffing around the sprayed plants , but have not eaten anything so I guess its working on them to . Nice my late season radish , lettuce , spinach , and peas are still there every morning . I do think it washed off a bit in the rain because over the last few days I noticed rabbits in the yard again . No problem as the one container is still 3/4 full . I will spray again . I like this stuff .	1
I recently moved into the Texas Hill Country and have come to experience the daily devastation of plants caused by rabbits and deer . I started buying deer-resistant plants but it turns out that deer do n't read the approved lists and eat most of them anyway . Then come the rabbits who arrive as packs of fluffy little plant chainsaws ready to destroy anything the deer missed . It 's a monumental pain in the ass and short of building cages around the plants , solutions are hard to come by.This spray is easy to apply and overall does seem to improve the carnage . It works by basically creating an unpleasant odor in the area that the animals do n't like and they choose to go somewhere else ( hopefully your neighbors are n't using the same product ) . I 've definitely seen fewer deer and rabbits ( I have no idea where the squirrels were in the first place ) since applying this mixture , so using this very unscientific method I believe it 's had an impact.But here 's the rub : when you have brutal drought conditions as we 've had here for the last 2 years , these critters will pretty much go through any barriers you attempt to employ to deter them . As one neighbor commented to me , `` When there 's no water , deer will eat anything - and your fancy sprays are like salad dressing to them . '' I had n't thought about my garden as a buffet but it 's a fair point . So I consider this another tool in my arsenal , rather than a complete solution , in the daily battle to save my plants .	1
We put this in our vegetable garden about a week ago and so far no deer or rabbits . Our poor neighbors had all of their tomatoes and spinach eaten by the Deer and the Rabbits the day after we used this , so I would say that is a pretty good indication . My husband said applying was easy and the sprayer worked great . So at this point , the product does what it says and so I recommend . If anything changes and the Deer show back up , I 'll post another review . *Added bonus , I LOVE that the ingredients are all very natural or I would n't have used .	1
Deer Off is the first product that I have used that really does keep them off . BUT , you need to reapply it on all new growth and new buds . It does't stop them for a month or two ( and it does n't claim that it will ) .We finally had two growth periods before those little devils came in and clean out the next bloom crop ! But , I will still recommend it to others in my neighborhood.So , this is a good product but I 'd like to see it work for at least 60 days or 2 bloom cycles . That 's why I gave it a 4 star rating .	1
I live in southern Connecticut where at times it seems like the deer outnumber the people . That 's fine with me since most of the time I prefer the company of animals to people ( I 'm a wildlife and travel photographer and writer ) . But that said , white-tailed deer can really do a number on expensive gardens and fencing seems pointless . I 've seen huge deer clear a six-foot fence like it was a few inches tall . It 's amazing how graceful and how high these deer can jump -- and from a standing position . You have to admire their athletic skills . But oh , yes , there is still that matter of expensive gardens.I do n't have much of a problem with deer in my own garden ( but there are some raccoons I 'd like to have a word with ) , so I got this ( from the Vine program ) for a friend of mine that lives in a slightly more rural area and has a two-acre garden -- a mix of shrubs and a large organic vegetable garden . Since this product is labeled as `` all natural and organic '' he was willing to try it . Unfortunately we hit a cold spell just as the product arrived and you 're supposed to use this when the temps are stable at 40-degrees F and above . So , we had to wait ( in the meantime , the deer did a number on a lot of his shrubs ) . But in the past week the temps have begun to stabilize at around 40F and the rains and snow have relented a bit . ( You obviously should not use this during a wet spell since the rain will wash it away . ) So this week we sprayed.I have to say that the sprayer works very well ( it takes a bit longer to prime than they suggest , no problem ) and has a sufficient force to cover even tall shrubs and some apple trees ( have you ever seen a deer on its hind legs ? Almost nothing is out of reach ) . The sprayer uses 4 AA batteries and that seems reasonable and they do n't weigh much.How is it working ? It 's only been a few days , so not enough time to really judge -- but yes , the deer do seem to be avoiding the area that we sprayed -- amazing . And theoretically , at least , the spray will deter them for up to three months . If this is true ( time will tell ) , then it 's worth the price a few times over . If you save one $ 100 shrub , well , there you go.I will report back in a few weeks . We 're keeping a close eye on this garden and even shot some `` before '' video ( right after the spraying ) to try and keep the whole project honest . More to follow in a few weeks . By the way , I 've been using Havahart traps since I was a kid and they are the best thing going for live-catching animals . Part of the reason that I became a wildlife photographer was that my parents gave me a trap when I was a kid and I became fascinated with the backyard animals.Update : 5/28/13 : Seems to be working , there is considerably less deer traffic in the area where we sprayed it ( twice ) . We got some rain after the first spraying , so that might have diminished its effectiveness , but had five days of nice weather after the second spraying and we have noticed that the shrubs seem to be enduring fewer attacks .	1
I remember an old joke about someone who `` kept a diary '' about their move to Minnesota ( though you could insert any northern state here , sorry Minnesota ! ) . When they first saw the beautiful landscape and snow during their first winter , they wondered how anyone can tire of such scenic wonder . By the end of the winter , enduring freezing temperatures , endless snow shoveling , and hitting a deer with their car , the person was wondering who in their right mind would want to live in such a place.When I transitioned into adulthood and bought my own place , I went through such a phase . However , my nemesis is the rabbit ! I moved to the suburban Midwest to an area where coyotes and hawks were not found amongst our manicured lawns and cedar fenced properties . The result is a rabbit population like I have never seen in my years of growing up in rural America where predators roam and hunting is a way of life.While trying to make my property beautiful , being the scientific mind I am , I began to develop a theory that there is a direct relationship to how much a single landscaping plant cost and how tasty the local rabbit population finds it . My `` non-indigenous '' $ 20 Home Depot potted flowers were a hit with the rabbit population while the local plant species that grow wild ( aka weeds ) were free to grow as high as the Willis Tower.I hate killing things for the sake of killing something and I really hate killing something that is just looking for a meal , so I began investigating non-lethal alternatives that did not involve live trapping and putting the pest in some poor farmer 's field . After failed attempts with moth balls , different repellent sprays , Milorganite , and other similar products and wives tales , my flower garden was still a high priced salad bar for the long eared minions.I had the opportunity to try Deer Off spray , which claims to ward off deer , rabbits , and squirrels.I first tried the product on some plants around my mailbox and waited a week . The plants failed to survive , but not because of a poor product or determined bunnies . An out of control car plowed through my planter and mailbox . Hmmm ... Deer Off does not deter out of control minivans . Check ! I moved to some other plants and I have to say I was quite pleased with the results . My problem is with rabbits only , so I can not speak as to the effectiveness of the product on deer and squirrels.Testing the product over the summer , I found out the following:1 . I tried applying directly to the plant as directed as well as tried applying to the soil around the plant but not on the plant itself . Using the product on the plant itself had far better results . If you are averse to applying this directly to your plants , applying it to the soil did help a little , but the results of doing so lasted a week at most before the rabbits began munching my tender pea plants.2 . The product does not last 3 months on fast growing plants . After trying various times between applications on different plants , I would personally recommend applying to fast growing flower and vegetable plants every two weeks.I did not find the smell of the product that terrible at all . Despite the active ingredient being putrescent egg solids , the smell of the solution reminded me of wet paint . After the product dried , I did not notice the smell at all.I thought the battery powered sprayer was quite awesome . While it is not difficult to use a classic trigger sprayer you have to constantly pump , the `` full auto '' batter powered sprayer made application very easy and quick.There were a few things I did not like about the product , but none of them were what I would deem deal breakers . While the product did not require much `` assembly '' , you did have to break the seal on the bottle and drop a flexible tube into the bottle . I found this part a bit messy . Second , a set of 4 AA batteries in the sprayer did not last me the entire summer.Overall , I was happy with this product for deterring rabbits . An application of the repellent was good for about two weeks when I used it on faster growing annual plants . I did not see the effectiveness of the product wane at all with time as long as I kept reapplying it . If you have a rabbit issue , I would definitely say this product is worth a try .	1
WOW ... the smell ... will deter most critters straight away ... . do NOT open this inside without expecting to fumigate yourself and do NOT apply before a rain to be effective.The active ingredients are Putrescent Whole Egg Solids ( fermented rotten egg smell ! ) , Capsaicin ( hot peppers to deter nibbling ) , and Garlic ( provides odor & nibbling deterrent ) so think of highly rotten eggs with hot sauce and vampire deterrent LOL Yes , it 'll work for it 's intended purposes . There may be better and cheaper homemade treatments , but the battery powered trigger is really awesome and worth the price of the product if you spray many things and do n't have/want to use a pressure/pump sprayer .	1
I used this along a tree line by my house . I constantly have skunks and deer coming out of the woods and tearing up the yard so I was looking for something I could apply . I got this and the granules by Havahart and put the granules around my patio and sprayed this around the treeline . So far I have n't seen any critters so I assume it works ! I like the battery sprayer , no more pumping .	1
I have only recently started using this product . I did n't want to build a fence to keep rabbits out of my flower beds , so I decided to try this product . So far we are seeing good results . This seems to be a good inexpensive alternative to pricey unattractive fencing . This product is very easy to use , I really like the battery powered sprayer . No pumping or mixing , just squeeze the trigger , walk and let the spay do its job . Try this product before purchasing a fence for your gardens .	1
I have used the previous version of Deer Off so knew what to expect . I loved the battery powered sprayer . It is much easier than the old sprayer . The Deer Off itself worked well . We are in a drought and the deer are very hungry . After I sprayed they left my flowers alone . The only down side is the fact that after watering or rain ( which we have not had ) you have to re-spray . I am having to water once a week just to keep things alive and that means that I have to re-spray . I have quite a few flower beds so the Deer Off will only do a couple of spraying .	1
I hastily ordered the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer thinking that since it 's for organic gardening , I would be able to spray this on my vegetable garden . Being that there are warnings on the packaging , I contacted Havahart and received the following reply : '' Thank you for contacting Havahart regarding Deer Off and I apologize for the confusion . The new labeling does state not to place it directly on the edible plant . The following statement is the one reason that we state not to use it when it will be consumed by humans : This product contains egg solids which may cause allergic reactions in some individuals . Do not allow spray to drift onto plants intended for human consumption.This is why we do not suggest using it on edible plants is there are a quite a few people out there with egg allergies and that can cause issues.We suggest putting a barrier around the garden area or the area you want to protect . All-natural DeerOff II is the only deer , rabbit and squirrel repellent that is OMRI Listed and compliant for use in organic gardening . Most importantly , it 's specifically designed for safe use around children and pets . `` Since the concern is the egg content and I have no allergies to eggs , I sprayed the product around but not directly onto the plants in my garden . I also sprayed the wire fence that the deer jump over in order to gain access into my community garden plot.The scent of deer scat was more offensive to me than the Havahart Deer Off II . Although I wish the deer , rabbits and whatever four legged creatures that invade my space would eat the weeds and not everything I like to eat , I 've seen no evidence that they were enjoying my buffet after the application . In all honesty , I 'm not sure if other gardeners are now providing them with more desirable morsels than my meager garden offers . Since many deer have been displaced in my northern Virginia community by the Beltway expansion , they have been devouring the landscaping in my community . I 've also sprayed a bit around some severely affected areas and this stuff appears to work.I 've noticed that the price has been reduced in the past couple days and I 'm not surprised since it 's also on sale at the Havahart website . At the current price , I can recommend the repellant and might add that the battery operated spray sure makes the application easy . I have n't had to change the enclosed batteries and expect that they will last through this jug . If you 're allergic to eggs , be especially careful when handling the liquid , but otherwise , I think we are safe .	1
We do n't get too many deer , so my testing ca n't confirm if this will help with deer issues or not , but I 've used it to keep rabbits away from bushes in the winter and spring in Wisconsin . We feed Squirrels and Rabbits and Raccoon , Opossums , and other small critters using feeders , mostly sunflower seeds , bird seed , and corn on the cob , so we get a lot of critters in the yard . I like to feed them food , but not my bushes or young plants in the spring , so I 've tried spraying this on the lower branches and they seam to stay away from those parts that have been sprayed - burning bushes especially .	1
When first opening the package and putting it together I noticed how impatient I am . The included batteries chose not to work as quickly as I expected ; however , after changing them for fresh ones and after a little more patience the sprayer for the Havahart Critter Repellent worked with ease and the test began . Deer Off II is of little value if there are few or no critters who roam the lands . We have several `` gangs '' of deer , about 2 or 3 families of skunks , several raccoons and squirrels plus a whole hooting nanny of turkeys of different sizes . Due to the nature of the land layout the deer have established a path from the hill across the street , across the creek and then through the front yard , up the back hill and into the woods . I put down a blockade of Deer Off II to see if it had any impact . It worked and after several days of rain and heat it still works . Yesterday I was watching out for a delivery and I noticed a herd of deer crossing the creek about 100 yards away instead of using their normal path through our yard . They are so pretty especially now when their antlers are beginning to lose the felt covering but they can eat an azalea plant in a short time . I can not tell about the other critters yet . They mostly travel at night and I do not . I put down a circle around the garbage can and as of now there have been no signs of critters other than a lizard leaving droppings most would not believe in terms of size for its size . Nature is wonderful as long as it recognizes an old curmudgeon such as I . Great product and works better than I expected .	1
I had picked this from the Vine selection because I have a few areas in my back yard with sand . One for temporary pools I set up in the summer for my young son , and the other area for the play set / swing set . I get a lot of small animals back there , rabbits , squirrels , etc , and got tired of animal droppings and such . So I figured this was worth a shot.We had a few days without rain in the forecast , so I applied it one afternoon when I got home from work . The motorized pump is a fantastic answer - I do n't know how many times I 've gone around my yard with standard spray bottles even for things as random as weeds , and the fingers and forearm feel the burn after a bit . And that 's just for spots here and there . Doing a larger area would not be something I 'd look forward to . So this worked great , once you got past the initial priming.I sprayed just the areas I wanted them kept out of , and surprisingly over the next couple days they really did avoid those areas in the back yard . So I decided to spray again after a rain storm we had , and this time I extended it to more areas , including around the front yard perimeter . I have some careless cat owner living in the area whose cat must spend more time around my yard than it does at home . And we have a lot of people walking dogs in our neighborhood , some of whom are n't as careful about where their pets do their business as I 'd like them to be . And this has also helped some with those as well . I have n't seen the cat even once after spraying around . Dogs tend to stay on the sidewalk.I do n't have any deer in this area to keep away , so I ca n't attest to the effectiveness against them , but it really does seem to work well for other animals , even ones I had n't anticipated . And the power sprayer makes this just a breeze to apply - just make sure you 're pointing it WITH the wind when you apply it , do n't want to be getting it on yourself ...	1
I got this product specifically for humanely deterring squirrels . For some reason , this season I have had a major issue with squirrels destroying plants in my vegetable and flower gardens - they were eating the flower heads off my sunflowers , chewing my corn plants , stealing my tomatoes and digging annoying little holes everywhere in the garden.After one liberal application of `` Deer Off '' , the squirrels have not been back . I do n't even see them coming near my plants anymore . I am also pleased so far with how long a single application has lasted . It has been over a week and I have even had one tropical storm/depression roll through without any loss of effectiveness . When I start seeing the squirrels come back I will simply reapply the product . The power sprayer makes it easy to spray and the large , ready to use sized bottle provides enough for 3-4 repeated applications in my small sized gardens.The sprayer seems a little inconsistent , but it sure beats spraying by hand . It helps if you adjust the nozzle to the desired spray pattern.I have to say that I was skeptical of this product but I have become a believer . I will continue to use this product to rid my garden areas of those pesky , destructive squirrels . By the way , I also sprayed an `` invisible border '' around my bird feeder and this has effectively kept the squirrels out of my bird seeds ( the birds do n't seem to mind ) .	1
This product is easy to use , and effectively repels vermin from my plants.The battery-powered sprayer includes four AA batteries required for operation . It has a three foot tube that extends from the lid , and I am able to hold the jug comfortably during application . The instructions mention a fine mist wand , but I did n't see one , but the main , twisting nozzle adjusts from stream to spray.The `` natural '' ingredients are clearly listed ; however , these only make up 4.632 % of the total solution . There are 95.368 % of other undisclosed ingredients .	1
I 've got some big redwood trees in my backyard and every year my squirrel population seems to grow . They run around my yard eating flowers , digging up my grass ( I used to think it was gophers ) , fighting with each other and creating a racket.Anyway , I figured I 'd give this Havahart repellent a try . I sprayed it around my yard . It works , less squirrel activity around my yard . They 're either sticking to the redwood trees or moved on to my neighbor 's house.So it was worth it for me , 5-stars .	1
I 've been using this for years . It is a great product for deer . Just remember to respray after a lot of rain . That seems to be the fatal flaw in all of these products . The battery sprayer sure beats pumping too !	1
The bane of my garden is deer . I usually have a problem with them nibbling the blooms on my tomato plants , then they return and eat a few leaves each day until there is not much left of the plants . I have no idea why they feel tomato foliage is so tasty , it stinks . Apparently adding this product with it 's `` putrescent egg product '' makes the foliage reach the bad smell tipping point until it 's no longe palatable . Or maybe the capsaicin does the trick ... I just know that we 're midway thru June , in the midst of a 4-week drought , and I 've had no deer damage on plants set out in mid-April . I sprayed them with this product weekly beginning in early May . I 've seen deer around , but they are leaving the tomatoes alone so far . I usually set out extra plants so I can maybe have a fruit or 2 for myself through the season , this year I might have enough to give away.I do n't have a problem with rabbits or squirrels , so I ca n't attest to the performance of this product on them.The included battery-powered sprayer is great . They thoughtfully included the batteries too . I think I 'll repurpose the sprayer for fungicide/insecticide when the DeerOff is all gone.I 'd buy this product .	1
The sprayer system here is great . It uses a battery pump to spray out the product . If you have ever walked around your property squeezing a sprayer hundreds of times , you know what a ( literal ) pain that can be.The sprayer takes a bit of time to get primed initially . Just hold the trigger for a minute or so and it will start working.The batteries are already in place - just flip the `` safety '' switch and pull the trigger.The product itself seems to work . I have deer , squirrels , groundhogs , and chipmunks . All had been eating a small garden I have on the side of my house . I sprayed this stuff on the garden and - after just a few days - I can see the garden starting to come back to life . The creatures are leaving it alone . I can also smell the product is still working . It leaves quite a scent ! I like this product a lot and will probably buy more when this runs out - which says something.I knocked off one star because I thought the directions were lacking . They print the directions in so many languages it is tough to find english and I never could find a definitive list of plants that this was approved for or creatures it blocks.It seems to be safe for my flower/herb garden .	1
My parents have a strawberry patch out back and use this to protect it from deer and rabbits . It did the trick and allowed them to walk out there and spray the surrounding area without too much effort . We had n't seen any bites in the patch after having used this stuff - so it must work ! And we have some AGRESSIVE rabbits , too ! !	1
I use this at my cabin which is in the woods with lots of deer & rabbits . My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall because the deer keep them `` pruned '' . The deer always browse the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers . Since this is a vacation house , I 'm not there to chase off the deer . We have security cameras so since I started using this product , I 've seen footage of the deer going to the bushes , nibble & walking away . Yea ! I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.It is rain `` resistant '' & it did last through several significant rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it . I could still see the milky residue on the leaves although it had definitely washed off some of it . I reapplied it just to be sure . The 90-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.The milky residue is not terrible looking but it is visible up close ; I think it looks better than putting up fence around all the bushes . It does have a noticeable odor for a couple hours after application . You may want to consider that if you 're spraying near your patio & planning on having dinner there . But it 's not very offensive ; just kind of sour smelling.This is an expensive option for deer repellant . I really do n't think it should cost this much considering the ingredients are not unusual . The battery sprayer is a nice option if you have any weakness or arthritis in your hands or arms ( the 4 AA batteries are included ) . Just make sure to rinse off the end of the nozzle when you 're done spraying or it will probably be clogged next time you use it . I just turn off the power to the sprayer ( lock position ) , open the little spray nozzle all the way & put it under running water . I 've had no clogs so far.UPDATE 8/2012 : This is working really well . My plants have grown more than any other year & the deer/rabbits are staying away . This is the only thing I 've tried ( other than fencing ) that keeps them from nibbling . I reapply the repellant every 2-3 weeks if there has been any significant rain .	1
Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered SprayerThere seems to be an endless parade of some cute little squirrel or bunny rabbit wandering around my yard ( especially in the late evening and at night ) looking for something to chow-down on -- vegetable gardens , flower beds , newly planted bulbs and roses -- especially in Spring and Summer ! *looks around* I do n't have a deer problem , yet , but have heard of deer moving into the city , because of the extreme drought conditions , looking for food.Being an avid organic gardener , I am always on the lookout for some , non-chemical , deterrent , or another , that will not harm critters , humans or the environment -- but will keep All , not invited , out of my gardens , off my newly planted shrubs , trees and flower beds.The Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer comes in an easy to carry container with a nifty side holster for storing the Sprayer after use . Both are made of a sturdy plastic . The container is not heavy ( a `` plus '' for carrying all over the yard ) and the handle is easy to grip and hold on to.Getting the The Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer up and running is a breeze , as they say.First : Go Outside ! : ) Just unscrew the container lid , peel off the foil covering , insert the `` dip tube '' , screw on the lid that comes with the sprayer , shake well , turn to `` ON '' , adjust the little nozzle at the tip of the sprayer for whatever type of spray you are in the mood for and squeeze the trigger a few times.At first , I could n't get the sprayer to spray -- so , I unscrewed the lid , lifted the `` dip tube '' out of the container -- checking to see if something might have come loose while shaking -- ( looked okay ) , put it back in , screwed the lid back down and squeezed the trigger again . Bingo ! Worked just fine.I then proceeded to spray all my zinnias -- cuz zinnias are butterfly magnets and this is the first plant the rabbits eat -- on their way to the sunflowers . The Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel label states that the product will last 2 to 3 months . Sprayer worked just fine and covered all the plant leaves with fine mist . Love that battery operated sprayer with it 's awesome pistol-like grip ! That was a few weeks ago . Zinnias are doing fine ( loaded with butterflies ) and the leaves have no munch marks -- and , blooming like crazy . My sunflowers are untouched because I sprayed them , as well . *pats self on back*The sprayer is easy to clean and store in the side holster . Do not throw away the original lid , as it will come in handy when storing left over product . : ) I found the battery compartment easy to open and the batteries easy to change out , or remove when storing.Does the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer sound like what you may be looking for ? : ) Highly Recommended ! -- Katharena Eiermann , 2012	1
Havahart Deer Off is easy to apply and seems to be keeping the critters from nibbling on all my flowering shrubs and plants in the yard . I would n't suggest using this on anything I would consume , but all the ornamental plants that the animals seem to like I would spray this on . We sprayed the Deer Off on some flowering and soon to be flowering plants , and I noticed that many of the blooms have n't been chomped off . This is a huge feat , considering how every few days our plants would be nibbled on . It 's seems to be effective , and we 'll be using this more in the spring when everyone seems to be eating stuff from our garden ! This stuff does stink a little , so wear clothes you do n't care about when applying . Recommended .	1
On July 4 , I went out my front door to find a deer sitting in my beautiful pink lantana bush , which they are not supposed to eat . Nevertheless , the deer have been mercilessly eating the flowers off this bush for the past several months . As a test , I sprayed the Havahart on the lantana , a rose bush , and a cypress tree ( deer rub antlers on these ) , these three plants being holdovers from my re-landscaping last September . No smell ... wonderful . I decided to give everything a second spray the next day , just because . On July 14 , I checked the plants for additional deer damage and found none , despite the fact there are new blooms on everything . So far , so good , and I will update this review for product effectiveness as time passes.Here are my comments about using the product . Havahart really is odorless . If you have ever used Liquid Fence , you will never forget what that product smells like ; I gave LF up because I tired of my yard smelling like a sewer or something rotting , not to mention myself . It is very difficult to get LF off your hands and clothing . Havahart comes with explicit , and detailed , instructions , including to never put the sprayer in your mouth ( lawyers ) . Two things should have been included . One , never mind the directions , the nozzle on the sprayer , as it comes , fully screwed in , will give a spray once the priming occurs . If you want a stream , then you have to turn the nozzle a quarter turn . This information will prevent you from getting the liquid all over yourself ( which I did ) . Second , for best results , you want to coat plants on a dead calm day , versus windy . After each use , I would also recommend taking off the nozzle and rinsing both it and the other side it connects to with water to prevent clogging.For over 20 years I have been gardening in a deer infested area . In my experience , the main deterrent that works , and is most cost effective , is fencing , at least six feet high . After that , for open areas and if you want flowers , you have to do your homework and cultivate strictly proven deer resistant growth , such as oleander , daisies , lantana ( usually ) , iris , and possibly azaleas ( at least in California ) . I had to completely redo my front yard in order to mostly persuade the deer to stop the munching . The reason why deer resistant plants are so important is because Havahart , like all commercial deer repelling products , is expensive ( not to mention the batteries ) , especially so if it comes ready to use and because it must be consistently , and perpetually , reapplied . It is also costly to continually replant the items that the deer destroy . If you persist in keeping plants that deer eat , in harm 's way , then you are forced to continue paying for products such as Havahart . Also , sooner or later , you are going to forget to reapply , or it rains , and the deer will prevail anyway.August 7 update : Regarding the effectiveness of this product , it has been over a month since I applied Deer Off on two consecutive days to four plants in my front yard . Everything is untouched . I am really impressed , considering the activity these plants endured for the preceding six months . However , I stand by my recommendations for fencing and hard line deer resistant landscape as the best defense against deer . If you do not mind the endless expense and continuous hassle of spraying , then I certainly recommend this product .	1
We live in the woods , deep in the woods and the deer like to play in our yard and snack on our shrubs and plants . So every year , my holly bushes get eaten back to nothing and the rhododendron get chewed to bits , even though they are right at the front door . I 've often looked out my window to see the deer right below it snacking away and staring at me . Needless to say , our landscaping is rather scrubby.Deer Off has worked so far . I applied a good coating to the most nibbled plants and so far no one has snacked . The container comes with a battery powered pump . The batteries are included but I had to replace mine to get it to work . The spray nozzle is slow and does n't put out a lot of solution so it takes awhile to get it to cover the leaves well . But eventually it all worked.So I give the solution 5 stars and 3 stars for the dispenser . The solution is more important so I think buying it wins out .	1
I live in the country- Rabbits come on to my property to get in my garden and my dogs will kill them.. Makes me sad- Since I have been spraying my fence lines ( sprayer works great ) have n't had any rabbits show up.. Also strangely enough I think its keeping the skunks away..Something that is a true nuisance- Very happy with this product~	1
This stuff stinks . It smells like sulfur . If you read the ingredients , one of the active ingredients IS rotten eggs . Not sure how I feel about spraying rotten eggs directly on my plants , but I know it 's not harmful or toxic , it just ... stinks.But it is keeping the deer away , and we have a lot of them . I was having some nightly nibbles and so far since we applied it , I have not had any more plant damage , although I have still had deer get in my yard right past it . One deer went right past the garden spot with the sprayed plants and got behind my chicken coop and was grazing on the grass there . I 'm not sure who was scared the most , my husband or the deer when my husband went to gather the eggs . SO , it seems to make the deer not want to eat the plants that the DEER OFF is sprayed on , but they do n't really seem to avoid or mind going past them.My concern is that it will require repeated applications after rainstorms or with time , which could get expensive . It also makes the garden a bit less pleasant to work in .	1
We have no deer problem , but squirrels drive our dog nuts and steal bird food from our feeders . I put this around the area and voila , no squirrels . Then it rained and they were back . So , spray after each rain.As for the battery-powered sprayer , what 's the point , other than using more liquid than needed and thus perhaps making you buy more ? Oh , cynical thought . What company would promote something that made you use more of their product than needed ? A simple manual sprayer is fine here , unless you plan on spraying a huge area . Plus you really do n't need much of this for it to work . A few ounces in a thin stream covered the perimeter of a couple hundred square feet for us.So yes , the stuff works , and no , you do n't need the power sprayer version . Just buy it in bulk and put it in your own dollar store spray bottle with the nozzle set to long thin stream .	1
We feed birds , so the yard is loaded with impy squirrels who get into everything . Every year I plant gazanias -- carefree colorful flowers -- and every year squirrels decimate them . Nothing is actually eaten ; plants are simply left in tatters . You 'd think after all these years I 'd give up trying to plant them , but fools never learn.We 've tried other deterrents without success . Squirrel Stopper is totally ineffective . This year I opted to try Havahart Deer Off II and guess what ? The gazanias live and thrive ( not one nibble ) . It 's been weeks and still no sign of squirrel damage anywhere in the garden where this has been sprayed . The same ca n't be said about areas sprayed near bird feeders , but that 's okay because I have other squirrel deterrent methods at work there . My primary goal was to stop garden destruction . The gazania test is definitive proof this product really works.I can tell when neighbors are using deer/animal repellents because the odor is so pungent . Not so with Havahart Deer Off . Its smell is n't noticeable , and the battery powered sprayer sure is easy to use . That may not suit everyone 's needs , but Deer Off comes in a variety of concentrates and sprays . Overall , I am very happy with results , and it 's so nice to see gazanias blooming again .	1
The Havahart Deer Off II Repellant is a good solution to keep the critters away from your gardens . I have used this with success to keep rabbits and squirrels and deer away from my garden . The sprayer bottle is easy to use with a battery powered spray wand . Keeps the fatigue away . You can use this around your flowers , plants and vegetables . Spray a perimeter and keep applying it after heavy rain . You should see good results !	1
I have serious difficulty using most spray products due to serious arthritic hands , wrists , and fingers . Normally , sprayer products are impossible or difficult for me to use . This one is unique in that it is battery powered , and the sprayer does n't cause me any pain during use . That in itself was a huge plus , and the fact that it is working super well is just icing on the cake for me . We have had a slight bit of rainfall , but the product is still working , and it 's been several weeks . Also , I have not noticed an overwhelming chemical smell , and that is a definite plus for me .	1
I had to wait quite awhile after receiving this product , because it would n't stop raining here . But we did finally get a couple of dry days , and we got to try the product . I was actually quite happy with it ! The electric pump system works great . It primed quickly , and has a very nice , even spray pattern that makes it easy to get full , even coverage on the plants . It 's easy to use and lightweight to carry around . The holster , while not perfect , keeps the spray head corralled when the product is on the shelf or when you 're carrying it , rather than having it dangling down in the way.The spray itself is not as rank smelling as Deer Skid or other rotten egg preparations , even though the label says it has more of the active ingredients than other sprays . Because it started raining again three days after spraying , I ca n't attest to how long an application lasts or how effective it is , although I can say that there was no new deer chomping on my plants during that three day window.The good points : The premix formula is great for small applications . It 's there , ready , when you need it and it does n't go bad sitting on the shelf , so you do n't have to use it all up in one application . The sprayer means that people with limited physical ability can use it easily , rather than having to pump up a tank sprayer or kill their hands squeezing a small sprayer a million times . It think it 'll be especially nice for when a person puts a new plant into the garden and it needs a quick spray to protect it.The bad ? Cost . Premix solutions are always a more expensive option than concentrates- you 're paying for water . But the jug is easily refillable with Deer Off made from concentrate , and I suspect the spray head will last through a good many applications . I think this is a good new tool for gardening .	1
I live in the middle of the woods and have a lot of deer , never too much of a rabbit problem . When I received my Deer Off I went outside and sprayed away , I did n't notice any bad odors that are so many times associated with repellents , which was a huge plus for me.The hand held sprayer is convenient and the off/on switch is rather nice as well . I 'm not sure if I sprayed too much but I did notice white splotches after the product dried on some of my plants.The deer have definitely stayed away , the down side is that we 've had a LOT of rain here and I 've had to spray too often for my taste , but that of course is not the products fault . The only downfall is the price , but I guess it 's worth it when you 're able to keep your plants looking nice instead of feeding them all to the deer.Too bad it does n't work on the chickens , they love my hostas .	1
Deer Off by Havahart is a great product for protecting your garden from animal pests . We used it this year for the first time , and it has kept all of the rabbits and deer away from our vegetable garden . It is very easy to use .	1
I have a lot of rabbits in my yard . When they find a plant in my garden that they like they will devourer it to the ground . The only thing that stops them is a fence , which is fine for my vegetables but not for the flowers . There is no way to keep them out and they are treating the garden like a buffet ! Since Deer Off advertises that it works on rabbits too , it was worth a try.I sprayed the hosta , daisies , and liatris ( which they love ) with Deer Off last week . Several of the hosta had been nibbled down to stems . The hosta are starting to grow back and the other plants have n't been touched . The rabbits are now leaving them alone . I know the rabbits are still in the yard , I watched one nibble on some parsley this morning and they are still grazing on the lawn.The product was easy to use , just turn it on and spray . I was expecting a nasty smell and was pleasantly surprised to find it very mild , almost odorless . The spray dulled the hosta a little bit and I could see some water spots , but there is no damage to the plants and they are showing new growth.The only problem I had using the sprayer was difficulty getting it to spray in a fine mist . According the the instructions , the bottle was supposed to come with a wand attachment for misting , but my package did not have the wand . Therefore I had to use the adjustment on the nozzle which caused it to come out in a stream . A minor problem for a product that works.Update : August 6 , 2012I have more bunnies than ever this year and they are staying away from the plants that I sprayed with Deer Off . Unfortunatly they started munching on a few other plants . I sprayed the remainder of my perennial garden a few weeks ago and they are now leaving all the plants alone and the munched on plants are growing back . The bunnies have taken to eating weeds and apples that the squirrels knock down from my tree . At the moment we are living in harmony ! And yes , I will be buying Deer Off next gardening season .	1
We have had issues with all kinds of crittersrabbits..deer..squirrelsthe deer come right up to the front door where there is a huge pine bushwe have been spraying it now for a month and have not caught them there oncewe do reapply after rain because i do not want them startling the kids againwhen they go out to play only to find deer in the walkway inches from the front doorand now we tried this on the one bird feeder basewe have tried so many other things for these squirrelsthen i thought maybe this would workand yes it hasagain i do reapply it after the rainslike so many have said it does have an odor but it does go awayit was easy to use right out of the boxthankfully no issues with the sprayersprayed it around the rhubarb to keep critters out of thatnow guess not sure if rabbits were the ones at it last weekbut no one has been bothering it this week with the spray on itso happy to have something to keep the critters at bay around herewe have a couple acres of woods so there are plenty of critters running aroundnow they are not such a pain as before	1
We 've used Deer Off for a couple of years and I was happy to get this bottle from the Amazon Vine program.We have a young orchard ( apple , peach and cherry ) and the deer love to rub their antlers on the trunks , meanwhile breaking off branches and even killing the trees . They also love eating the fruit . Deer Off keeps them away , although we have to spray after every rain.I have several birdfeeders , and the squirrels tear them up over and over . Deer Off keeps them away without keeping the birds away . It 's so nice to have birdfeeders last more than one season ! This product does n't work against raccoons - evidently they love the nasty smell because they continue to get in the garden tear up the corn . We have n't had any rabbit damage so I ca n't say if it works against them.I like the handle in the bottle , and the spray hose , but I wish it were a manual pump . I did n't find the battery power necessary to spraying.Overall this is a great product that humanely repels deer and squirrels .	1
This product is fantastic ! I 've tried a variety of methods of keep the deer and rabbits from eating everything in my yard with various and inconsistent results . However , after using this product , nothing in my yard has been nibbled by the wildlife , and the bonus is that it claims to be organic and it smells like pretty mild . It seemed to last about a week the first time before needing to be re-applied , and then after a rain shower , I re-applied ... so far ... .and the motorized sprayer is a great addition !	1
My backyard abuts a forest with a beautifully cleared walking trail that runs along my property line . This makes it very easy for the deer to walk down the trail and into my yard . Because of the topography of my yard , a fence will not work . So I battle the deer every year . After years of studying and testing different brands , I believe I am quite the expert when it comes to deer repellants ! This repellant is designed to work on rabbits , squirrels , and deer . Regarding rabbits , this does not work as well as Bobbex spray . This does work very well on deer . I still have my oak leafs and annabelle hydrangeas and my hostas still have leaves . As a deer repellant , this does a fine job , as good as my old stand-by Bobbex spray.No major complaints with this product . One quibble , it took at least a couple of minutes for the sprayer to prime . Just expect to wait a few minutes . Once the sprayer started working , it did a fine job . Much easier than spraying by hand . The sprayer also lessens the likelihood of getting the nasty smelling repellant on your hands .	1
We just bought a house , a relatively newly built house , way out in a new development . There 's only several dozen houses out that way , and surrounded by nothing but big , open fields , and LOTS and LOTS of little rabbits . And apparently , in the process of buying our house , a rabbit was burrowing under the house , so as a contingency , we asked the seller to fill it , and he did . And what does the clever little rabbit do ? Burrow under the house , a foot or two away from where he filled the last one ! Well , my husband was like `` I 'll get my gun and take care of those little jerk rabbits , I do n't want them to ruin the foundation of my house ! '' And I said `` hey now , wait a minute . You ca n't just kill them ! They 're cute and they 're fluffy , and technically , they were living there first before us and a bunch of other people bought/built homes on top of their homes . '' So I ordered some of this spray , in order to avoid those little bunnies from meeting their grisly doom.And so far , it 's worked really well ! Those fluffy little buggers are no longer invading the area under our house . The husband is happy , and I 'm happy the bunny rabbits did n't have to die.I also recommended this product to a good buddy . His friend recently bought a new truck . And apparently , to be more `` environmentally friendly , '' some auto manufacturers have started encasing some of the wires in the engine with vegetable oil , among other things . Well , guess what ? Rabbits now climb up into his engine , and chew the crap out of his wires , thinking they 're for eating ! And unjustly enough , that sort of damage is n't covered under his warranty , as it 's an `` act of god . '' That does n't seem to make sense , because really , that should be considered an `` act of stupidity '' on the part of the manufacturer . So now , my good buddy keeps this stuff in his car , and sprays around his car any time he parks some place new to keep the rabbits away from his engine wires . And it 's worked well for him , too ! So whatever your `` rabbit-off '' needs are , this product will work for you !	1
When you get critter repellant , you expect it to repel critters . After the mixed reviews , I was unsure of what to expect , but I decided to give it a shot.The sprayer needed some minor assembly when I received it . The batteries were already in mine , so all I had to do is stick the hose into the bottle and start spraying . The only problem I had is that it took longer to prime than I was expecting . I tried keeping the bottle high and adjusting the nozzle . Nothing seemed to work . I opened the bottle to be sure the end of the hose was in the liquid , and it was . With the top unscrewed , I tried the sprayer again and suddenly fluid was spraying copiously.Because the sprayer is motorized , and sprays quickly , the next part was easy . Having had experience with insect sprays , which recommend a two foot width to serve as an insect blocker , I sprayed about a two foot width around our cucumbers right after Peter Cottontail had sampled many of our ripe cucumbers.I was annoyed that Peter seemed undeterred by the spray . He came back to visit the very next day . However , to my surprise Peter seemed to be much less interested in our cucumbers after his return visit . Indeed , after his one return visit , he and his relatives seem to be avoiding our cucumbers.Now , the bunny brigade seemed quite enamored of our cucumbers prior to spraying this critter repellant , and suddenly their interest has dropped off to near zero . Either the bunnies decided the succulent cucumbers were not as yummy as they had previously thought , or this stuff works . My assumption is that after waltzing through the repellent the bunnies realized that the welcome mat had been removed.Now it is time to focus on our lettuce , which is disappearing about as fast as it grows.Enjoy !	1
This product is simple and easy to use , not incredibly smelly ( nor does it smell good ) , and kept our deer neighbors out of the garden . Enough product for several uses . See instructions , do n't apply at rainfall .	1
We live on a street with a LOT Of deer and they love to eat my husband 's flowers , especially this time of year . This is why I ordered this product from the Vine program . It was frustrating at first because the sprayer just would n't work . It seemed that it would take a rocket scientist ... Then , we realized that the batteries needed to be changed and things improved . It seems to work pretty well at repelling the deer from the flowers - which is really nice .	1
I ca n't rate it for deer or rabbits . But we get squirrels in our attic , especially as Fall & Winter approach.I 've patched the roof ( twice now ) where they chewed into the crawl space . I do n't know if my roof work was the solution , or if the spray works , or both . I tend to think the spray helps because squirrels can actually chew through a 2x4 if they really want in . So I think the smell ( or however it works ) helps repel them.It 's also super easy to apply , with the powerful battery powered sprayer . I can actually get the spray onto the 2nd story of my house from a little step ladder . The bottle comes with batteries , and the sprayer works great . And I really love that it 's non-toxic , so if some of it drifts into the yard , it 's no big deal .	1
Last year , the deer ate the blossoms and new fruits on all our plum , crabapple and cherry trees that they could reach stripping the young branches until they looked dead . This spring I 've started using the Deer Off and it really seems to be working so far . I still have lots and lots of blossoms and I know that the deer are still coming around because some buck decided to rub his antlers on our magnolia ... I hope it still deters them when we finally start to get fruit !	1
We decided to try this to keep mice out of our camper van while in storage . The product does n't advertise that it repels mice , but it does seem to we effective , as the little critters have not returned . I will continue to update this review to ensure that it is indeed working . So far , so good !	1
We live in a wooded area and squirrels are frequent , and in some cases even deer . We have used the product , and at first it did not look as if it were working , but then used a higher quantity and it did .	1
The battery operated sprayer is excellent ! Saves a lot of pumping work ( compared to a jug of the ant barrier spray that needs a lot of work to get the house perimeter done ) . The spray is labeled for deer , rabbits , and squirrels and does keep rabbits off of the plants we applied the spray to . Not cheap for the jug , but does work well .	1
If you live in a rural area , you know how much damage deer can do to a garden . Havahart repellents are the best on the market and this one is no different . One of the best features of this repellent is the built in sprayer . This allows you to use it the moment you notice damage and without having to mix up anything.Another great feature is that there are no harsh chemicals involved . Just garlic , eggs and hot pepper capsaicin . This repels both by scent and taste . It is safe around children and pets and long lasting , good for up to 3 months .	1
I did the perimeter of my home garden which in previous year had been a feeding ground for the small deer in my area . So far , I have n't had any problems with deer . The two rabbits in the are stay away too . I do n't really care about squirrels.The battery powered sprayer is a nice feature . It 's much better than having to pump it by hand or use a trigger.The scent is n't too bad and the product lasts at least 6-8 weeks.Keep in mind that a little goes a long way .	1
This is really a nice container to use easily . Battery powered and consistent spray . Beats pumping or pouring into another container.It seems to have kept the critters at bay , which is what this is supposed to do . Hard to know if it 's the product or they have wandered into another yard , but I have no doubt this has helped.The smell is n't bad and it 's outside.Ca n't go wrong with this product .	1
I was about to give up on this , until the sprayer inexplicably decided to work ... no worries then . So I did n't use Deer Off over every garden on my priority , I thought we 'd get a better sense of its effectiveness if I left some areas untouched . The result , I 've been watching a mother doe and her fawn visit my yard now for the past two weeks , however any `` munch damage '' has been confined to the control group beds that are in the back of the property . The more ornamental flower beds in the front have survived unscathed . And to underscore that effectiveness , those protected flower beds are heavily populated with hosta ... a whitetail deer 's most delightful treat in this neck of the woods.It would appear that this works so well that I can forgive the recalcitrant sprayer .	1
I bought this to rid my yard of squirrels and it works great ! I applied a liberal amount around the trunk of each tree and on the toos of branches where they like to sit . The very next day - no more squirrels . It lasted about two weeks before I had to reapply and the second application worked just as well .	1
I mostly wanted this for a house in PA that has rabbits eating the gardens and flowers every day , they are everywhere . We have tried other sprays that have not really worked , or worked for a day or two and then the animals were back eating the leaves . What I really liked about this Havahart repellant is that it works for deer , rabbits and squirrels , I do n't need 3 different things . It is very convenient with its own spray hose thing attached to it . Very easy and convenient .	1
With so many products , I have to ask my husband to mix it up and put it in a sprayer for me . Or , I have to hand spray with a bottle and just ca n't effectively apply enough . This product solves both of those problems.It came premixed , so I did n't have to worry about that . And the sprayer is a really nice feature . It came with batteries already installed , which is rare in a product . I 'm not sure they were all that powerful , but I 'm thankful they were included.The instructions were n't super detailed , but I figured it out . You have to remove the safety cap ( press down and turn like a pill bottle ) and insert the sprayer hose into the jug . The cap that screws on as part of the sprayer assembly does not have a childproof lock . The switch on the sprayer has a safety switch . It is n't as if it 's greatly child-proof as you just slide the switch up and spray , but it deters a little.It took a long time to prime the sprayer the first time . I headed in the house to get different batteries because they seemed weak , but when I came out , my husband had it working . He said he just held the sprayer handle in ( as I had been doing ) and it eventually started . You can adjust the spray pattern by turning the end of the nozzle , but I did get product on my fingers when I did that , so I do n't recommend adjusting much once you get going.I sprayed all around the perimeter of my garden since we have trouble with rabbits . So far , it seems to be working . We have n't had a heavy rain yet to really test it out , but the lettuce and spinach are intact.I love the battery operated sprayer and convenience of application . The sprayer has a removable holster that hangs on the jug for convenience in between spraying and for storage .	1
I live in a townhouse community and have been unable to grow much of anything except herbs in planters over the past few years because of the local squirrel population . I tried again this year wrapping my tomato planters in tin foil and booby-trapping it with small items which I figured would drop and scare the critters away if they approached them . Needless to say , they ate up almost the entire group of plants from fruit to stems . Fortunately , a small piece remained in one planter that looked like it was attempting to continue to grow . So , I got this Havahart repellent and again circled the planter with tin foil and sprayed the foil and planter with the liquid . So far , so good . This plant is flourishing now ( about 1.5 feet high ) and I have n't seen a squirrel in site ( yet ) . So , the product seems to do the trick . Only difficulty I had was in the set up ( thought the instructions were a little difficult to follow ) . But , after trial and error , I got the automated spray to work and it apprears to do well .	1
I love the `` fuzzy tailed tree rats '' that live in my neighborhood and want them to survive nicely but once in a while they go too far . Last year they decided my seat cushions were good nesting material . In the fall it was my hammock that took care of their needs to chew . They are constantly digging up this potted plant or another to hide their treasures . I ordered Deer Off hoping it would help . Then I got scared of it - what if it really , really smelled bad ? I did n't want a bad odor coming from my flower beds and from under the hammock . Finally , the last straw was drawn when I saw these critters running around under my solar panels . These panels are expensive , with lots of wires that squirrels do n't need to chew on so I climbed my ladder and started spraying . The battery powered sprayer is a great feature . I 'm not too steady on a ladder and it 's a two story house so I do n't want to be pumping like crazy to get this stuff out . The odor was n't too bad and dissipated quickly . Best of all , I did n't hear the pitter patter of little feet on my roof after spraying . It 's been a few days and still no squirrels . Next I think will be my flowerbeds . They love to bury things in them . Perhaps I 'll spray where the neighborhood rabbit likes to nibble and see if it chases him away too .	1
I was offered the Deer Off through Amazon 's Vine program and figured why not try it . Our house is surrounded by woods and therefore surrounded by deer , rabbits and squirrels ( the animals deer off claims to deter ) I had just put in my vege garden and do not have a fence around it yet . The label says it is safe to use on vegetable plants - however it also does state that you will need to reapply with growth and although it is working on the small leaves now , I wonder what will happen once my plants start blossoming . I also applied it to the blackberry bushes along the wood line and nothing has touched them yet ! I might be able to get some jam and pies this year ! ! I will update this review once the plants start blossoming and my veges start appearing.Edited to add : Well , after the berries have come and went they were not bothered very much at all by any wild animals ! My garden is still being left alone as well , even with a bunny nest right in the middle of it . I think Deer Off might actually be working !	1
I read a few reviews before using this . I , too , had hoped I could spray it around my yard..as in..around the whole perimeter of the yard..to keep critters OUT completely ! Instead , I sprayed it on plants directly.I have lived in this house for nearly 20 years and we did not have a deer or squirrel ( or rabbit ) problem until two years ago . Now , it 's like someone is flying them in ! ! Now boarding , all critters , on route to Sheri 's for the summer ! So , I used this Havahart on my pretty shrubs etc and it 's working perfectly ! They approach , taste..yuck yuck , and scamper off to my neighbor 's pretty shrubs and trees ! Yeah ! I would tell my neighbors about this , but I do n't want to mess with a good thing . ; 0 )	1
I have to say I finally got this little critters from running anywhere but in the tree.I was tired of them in my gardens and running all night on my roof . When you set up a perimeter of where you do not want the Deer , Raccoons or Squirrels to go . Spray and they will not come in that area . I sprayed and it worked just great . after thirty days I sprayed again , you do not have to use a lot.If you do not have a lot of rain it will last longer , overall good product .	1
I live in a rural area and there is no short supply of rabbits and deer . The deer mainly eat the flowers my wife is trying to grow in the front of the house - the rabbits prefer my garden.In past years I 've had some success with fencing off the garden but nothing we tried ever protected the flowers . So far this year my wife has lost several flowers to deer.I was n't very optimistic that a spray of any sort would protect them both when so many other sprays ( and gadgets ) failed to do so consistently.The first thing I liked that surprised me was the battery-powered sprayer . I was thinking that it had to be a gimmick , but it really comes in handy . I know when I have to apply a lot of weed-killer that my fingers get cramped up after awhile using the spray-pump.Because it 's non-toxic and USDA approved for organic gardening , I dosed the garden with a generous spraying of Havahart 3 weeks ago . Same with my wife 's flowers around the driveway and front of the house.So far , so good . None of the flowers have been eaten ; and the same goes for my garden ( lettuce , corn , tomatoes , eggplant , peas , beans ) . And I 'm particularly pleased that ALL of my lettuce is coming up perfectly - no nibbles at all.Two ( green ) thumbs way up for Havahart !	1
I have tried lots of different types of animal repellents , but to no avail ! This one works pretty well ! I did notice , however , even in dry weather , that it did n't last quite as long as I would have liked ( only about 4-5 days ) before I had to reapply.The sprayer takes a little getting used to since it 's a powered sprayer , but once you figure out what direction to aim it and how long/hard to squeeze the trigger , it is a breeze and beats the hand cramp you get from normal self-squeeze sprays ! Overall , it works a little better than the other products out there , but it still is not the `` magic potion '' we 've all been hoping for !	1
During the fall , the squirrels dig up all the plants in my small backyard , and sit on my fence and throw black walnut shells against the white paint on my garage , staining it deeply . I ignored this product for a long time assuming it was toxic and because I did not want to get rid of the squirrels completely . Once I realized it really was a safe mix that would n't kill everything , I thought it would be nice to try . And it is . I can put a very small amount on boxed plants and on my fence without scaring the squirrels out of the yard completely ; the power of the black walnut tree overcomes all .	1
This product was applied 3 weeks ago to my hanging and standing flower pots . Since then , I have not had squirrels sitting in my pots grazing away on my flowers . What a relief that has been to say the least !	1
I was very interested in the Deer Off product because we live in a very rural area and have deer ground hogs , chipmunks , and squirrels , both gray and red , around the house all the time . This is n't necessarily bad , unless they decide to get into the cellar or attic , or eat our plants.I ordered Deer Off to see what it would do . I was also interested in the battery powered sprayer . My first problem was that the Post Office failed to deliver the package . They thought it was leaking . ( As far as I can tell , it was n't . However , that made me wary . ) I followed the directions , shook up the container , inserted the hose for the sprayer , turned it on and nothing happened . I tried several times , still nothing . I cleaned the nozzle and the ball that 's inserted in the container . Still nothing . Finally , I got a piece of wire to try to clear the blockage , still nothing . Then I noticed that there was no hole in the plastic plate that covered the hole where the liquid should come out . I punctured it and the sprayer started to work.On the positive side , the spray worked extremely well after I opened the hole . I was able to spray all around the house . Obviously , I will have to wait to determine whether it deters the critters.If the critters are discouraged by the product . I 'll be thrilled . I am glad that I was able to make the sprayer work - makes you feel powerful !	1
We do have a community garden at my apartment complex and squirrels are a bit of a problem . So far , this is more effective than other brands and the sprayer definitely is a plus .	1
I was surprised at how much I liked the convenience of the power sprayer . It seemed gimmicky at first , because how hard is it really to use a manual spray trigger , right ? However , the more I used it , the more I appreciated it . We have a lot of hostas that the deer love to eat , and some vines that climb on a trellis , and ... well , it 's so easy to use that it made light of an often tedious job . I like that Havahart has refill sprays available , otherwise , it would seem kind of wasteful to throw away the battery-powered sprayer once it 's empty . ( Alternatively , I see no reason why you could n't use this sprayer for other kinds of liquids . ) Unlike some repellent sprays I 've used , the smell of this one is quite tolerable . Some are offensive for hours after spraying . This spray , on the other hand , is formulated to dry so that it ca n't be smelled by humans . Before it dries ? Even then , the smell was barely noticeable.I do have one big concern , however ... and this might matter a lot if you plan to spray this on a vegetable garden : The photo on Amazon 's product page shows a rabbit and a squirrel running near what seems to be a vegetable garden . This seems to suggest that this would be a good spray to use around your vegetables , right ? The warning on the product label , however , states : `` Do not allow spray to drift onto plants intended for human consumption . '' There are deer repellents out there that are safe to spray on vegetable gardens . Apparently , this is not such a spray . I think this is something that needs to be clarified on the product page .	1
Havahart Deer Off works OK . I do love the way it sprays with its battery operated sprayer , as your hand does n't get tired like it does with hand operated ones . NOTE : I do n't have deer , so I can not comment on the effectiveness of this product on them . However , I do have rabbits and this repellent seemed to work against them . Also , the product did n't smell bad , which is nice when applying .	1
Every winter when the greenery turns brown the rabbits decide that my new lilac bushes and new grape vines are quite the tasty alternative . So when I tried Deer Off I was thrilled to find that they stopped the nibbling . The sprayer is easy to use and I love that I do n't have to purchase a sprayer separately ... that 's a huge plus . Note that you ca n't use this on plants you are going to eat ; so while it should be okay to spray the base of my vineyard ; eventually I am not going to be able to use it on the upper portions for deer , etc ...	1
I 'm a city girl , so when we first saw deer in the garden , my reaction was to say `` ooooh , '' not `` shoo . '' But then I saw how destructive they were , I changed my tune . They trampled the tomatoes and just dragged the peas and eggplants out to the driveway . If the deer were starving or even just a little hungry , I would n't mind . But mostly they are just stepping on things , knocking them down and tearing them up . I think they may be deer vandals . We tried to be nice and bought them hay and a barrel of apples to bribe them away from the garden , not to mention that this is summertime . Hello , deer , the forest ? There is an entire mountain of edible greenery just inches away and they can eat the whole damn thing , but no , it 's my zinnias and swiss chard they 're after . I worked hard on the garden , blistered my hands and put them into duck poop for it . I never worked harder on anything in my life . And then there 's the expense . Nobody tells you that you have to take all your money and credit cards to Sears and exchange them for planting stakes and tomato cages , lattices , a compost box , shears and secaters ( same thing if you ask me ) , hoes , rakes , shovels , pointy things you poke into the ground , little versions of the hoes , rakes , shovels and pointy thing , garden gloves , soil enhancer , plant food , watering systems , watering cans , hoses and nozzles , plus cute sun hats and decorative baskets to hold your harvest except that there is no harvest because bambi stomped on it . Anyway , after you add it all up , it works out to about 8 bucks a carrot.I asked the deer nicely to go away , hung soap on string to scare them ( the guy at the nursery recommended this , I think he was pranking the city slickers because it turns out , deer enjoy the brisk , manly scent of Irish Spring ) , and pinwheels , which only made the deer snort in derision . The Havahart Repellent is the first thing that worked . The deer ate all the flowers in the bed on the far side of the house , which did not get spritzed . This is because Havahart Repellent stinks like a son of a gun . Two sons of a gun . The active ingrediet is rotten egg stink . If we put it on the flower bed near where we sit , we would be dead now . The formula also contains garlic and capsicum ( hot pepper ) because deer do n't like the taste . But it 's the stink that does it . This stuff would repel the living dead . The deer wo n't come near the stuff , which is good , because the caterpillers do n't like sharing.The sprayer works very well , and it 's easy to get it pumping . Just for pete 's sake , do n't hold the sprayer up and look at it to see if it 's jammed . Get that stuff on you and invitations to dinner just dry up . The directions are explicit and easy to follow . You pour in the Deer Off solution , press the trigger ( pointing away from you ) once or twice , and there you go . Of course every dog in a 500 mile radius will want to roll in it . I got some on my shoes and it took two days to peel the beagle next door off of me.This is a very simple , humane and effective way to shoo varmints . You might also consider using it to repel in-laws and prevent adult children from moving back home .	1
This works as well for me as other deer sprays and was much easier to use . I know from my own and other research that you have to change the deer sprays every few weeks . Throwing the deer off balance by introducing strange new smells is important . I have some issues with my hand and it was great to not have to squeeze the trigger to cover my extensive gardens . I will continue to use this , will buy more , and will refill the first bottle with another brand.The label says it can last for three months , which sounds great . However , in smaller print it says to reapply after a heavy rain . Maybe some of you live in an area where it does not rain or you do n't use a watering hose for three months , but I do n't . It also says it is made ineffective by freezing . It does n't say if it is referring to the bottle of solution or after it is applied to the plant ( maybe both ) .Again , it works as well as other sprays , but the other sprays do n't make such claims .	1
We have wood siding on our house and the woodpeckers love it . A friend of mine suggested trying deer repellent as it had worked for them . I sprayed the areas the woodpeckers seemed to favor and have n't seen them on the house since . I 'm not entirely sure this stuff did the job all by itself and it was n't also simply a change in the season , but they 're gone and I will use this again in the spring .	1
If you have unwanted guests munching on your garden . The does a great job at keeping away the unwanted guests . Also it is nice that I do n't have to go trigger happy and drench the entire garden . It works good , and I would recommend it .	1
This product has a nice twist - You do n't have to pump to dispense the fluid . The sprayer is battery powered and emptied the whole gallon jug without any trouble . That made it very easy to just walk around the spray the fluid where I wanted it.The sprayer has an adjustable nozzle that provides a fine mist to a direct stream . You can control how you want to direct the fluid.When I first connected the sprayer to the bottle it took a few minutes to prime the sprayer . Additionally , you have to work the rubber tube to get it straight so that it reaches to the bottom of the gallon jug . Since its sent coiled , it tends to want to coil back up again . But for the most part I had no trouble dispensing the fluid - just a couple times I had to correct the tube so it reached the bottom.The fluid is not like other Deer Repellant . I have used some products that smell so bad that its unpleasant to dispense and unpleasant to walk around the yard after the repellant has been dispensed . This fluid had a very slight smell of acetic acid , but by no means was it overpowering , in fact for the most part it was not unpleasant at all . If it works , this could be the solution I have been looking for.I 've told you about the dispenser , the fluid , and I will wait to see if the squirrels and deer show up tonight and what areas they avoid . So really this review so far is about the product and the delivery mechanism . We 'll see what happens with the varmints later tonight when they usually come ...	1
We have a lot of rabbits around our house . Sometimes we do n't mind them , but sometimes they 're a bit of a nuisance , eating our vegetables , pooping on our grass and ( more recently ) burrowing under our house.I got this because I heard good things about Deer Off in general and love the battery-powered delivery system ( as opposed to the pump I 'm used to with other products ) .I also have 5 young kids , and I appreciated that this product is supposed to be safe around them ! Good product overall .	1
I sprayed Havahart Deer Off II around the foundation and on the porch of an empty house I own . I had seen them on the house looking for a way in , and did n't want them moving in for the winter . The squirrels have not been back . I do respray after a heavy rain . This is a great , humane way to keep them at bay .	1
We do n't have a deer problem but this product seems to work for squirrel and raccoon problems . We 've also had problems with our cat scratching the paint off of our back door when he is anticipating his meal . I sprayed some of this on the back door and he has not touched it ! I thought the battery powered pump was a little ridiculous but realize that some people may actually need that if they have problems with their hands . It seems to work just fine although you have to hold the trigger in for a while before it starts to spray .	1
As a landscape architect , I 'm always looking for a kind yet effective way to keep bunnies and squirrels from destroying my client 's gardens . I 've gone the utterly `` Old School '' route , using dog fur , dried blood meal and Tabasco sauce , with very limited results . The rabbits in particular were destroying customer 's perennial beds , mowing them down to nothing . I ordered this product , based on reviews and the fact that it had a battery powered sprayer ... woo-hoo ! I then sprayed what was remaining in the gardens and the hydrangeas , which seem to be a bunny food . Voila ! Like magic , the remaining bits of the garden were saved and my clients were thrilled ! I also have tried this on emerging tulips ( just as they show their bud poking up ) and that also saves them from the bunnies and the squirrels . LOVE the motorized sprayer ! When you have a large area to cover , it sure saves the pain of application .	1
For small areas , this battery-powered sprayer is a great , lightweight improvement over the pump sprayers . After spraying our pergola , all squirrels abandoned it - overnight ! We do have a metal squirrel proof feeder which effectively keeps away all squirrels . We know this because we saw dozens of squirrels try to feed from it , crash to the ground , and then give up trying . This spray will be very useful when we start feeding the birds again next Fall . I plan to spray the plastic finch feeder to keep squirrels from chewing on it . They are welcome to enjoy the seeds we leave on the ground for large birds.This easy-to-carry and use sprayer is also perfect for spraying small areas of flowers or a vegetable garden against deer . I will test it on rabbits as soon as they appear in our vegetable garden .	1
I 'm using this for small critters - rabbits and squirrels . We have a large back yard - it 's fenced in , but rabbits ignore large fences , and squirrels just look and laugh . Or chitter . When our garden is in full bloom these critters must see an invisible `` salad bar '' sign . So I sprayed the plants with Deer Off . There was a definite drop off in plant damage.I can take or leave the battery powered sprayer . It works well , but it 's another set of batteries to die over the Winter ( Batteries are included . ) I prefer the containers with the pump that pressurizes the chamber and lets you spray for almost a minute.One thing I am going to try - Squirrels destroy our Halloween pumpkins , carved or not ( the pumpkins , not the squirrels . ) They love the taste of that Golden Squash . I 'm going to spray the pumpkins with Deer Off and see what happens . I 'll update this once I try that .	1
I did n't get the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off product to repel deer . I wanted it to keep squirrels away from our bird feeder and out of my wife 's flower beds . Those pesky squirrels have been eating bird seed out of our feeder and digging around looking for dinner in among the flowers . We were about out of ideas to keep them at bay until I found the ` Deer Off ' stuff.The Ready-to-Use Repellent came with a Battery Powered Sprayer that works a whole lot better than those trigger squeezing applicators most garden products utilize . The product does not stink and it is applied easily.Well , now about the effectiveness of the Havahart DO64MS repellent . After we squirted almost everything we wanted to protect with the product there has not been a squirrel around doing mischief to anything . Maybe the squirrels have gone north for the summer or maybe they are working at night or just maybe the Havahart repellent is working . We have our fingers crossed.I prefer to think the squirrel problem is under control and the repellent is doing what it is supposed to do . So far the flower beds have not been disturbed and the bird feeder remains off limits to the squirrels . It has been about two weeks since the repellent went on.If the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent along with the Battery Powered Sprayer fails in the future I will update this review , but things look good so far .	1
The battery powered sprayer is a neat little bonus with this repellent and very welcome to these arthritic hands.It does make application much easier . Here in Colorado this year we 've had feast and famine when it comes to rain . We 're faring better than the middle of the country certainly and my garden has been pretty productive . But the squirrels and rabbits have wreaked their havoc so I decided to use some of this stuff and it works . I 've had to make three applications because of heavy sporadic downpours , but it does deter the little pests and they stay clear . I would recommend it and the powered sprayer ( just be sure to do your maintenance so the sprayer does n't become clogged ) really is much simpler to use than pump ... pump ... pump ... .I would say buy it to any gardener who asked .	1
We like this product as it seems to be keeping away the squirrels from the garden and it 's keeping the bird feeder safe for the birds ! We really love the sprayer in this repellent . It does make a bit of an irritating noise while it 's working , but that 's not a big deal . It sprays out a couple feet . The battery powered sprayer made using this really easy . It came with batteries , but the batteries were dead.We do n't get deer or rabbits in our yard so I do n't know how this works on them . Overall , this is a good product to keep the squirrels away from our yard !	1
Arrived in record time with easy to follow instructions and sprayer - even had batteries included that still had a charge . I 've used mixes in the past so this was not messy as well as easy and quick to spray on those new sprouts coming up.Sprayed two days ago and have n't seen any damage from rabbits or deer yet . Time will tell though - I 'll see how long the new plants go untouched , how often I have to spray and how long it lasts . The 'mix ' that I use has an AWFUL smell -- I did n't notice that with this so time will tell how well it works and I have my doubts.One thing about it - it 's a pleasure not having to pump air into the sprayer . This is going to be a reusable , lightweight container for me .	1
I used this after using the Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent , 5-Pounds Granular Shaker . Both work well alone , but I think they work better together.The advantage of this product is the spray seems to last longer than the granular shaker and I was able to spray this on plants as well as on garbage cans , to keep away the squirrels . rather than shaking a product onto the ground.I do n't have much of a problem with deer but squirrels and rabbits and chipmunks and raccoons are in abundance . This works best on deer , squirrels and rabbits while the shaker works well on raccoons and chipmunks as well . This product has more of a rotten egg odor while the shaker has more of a burning pepper odor.I sprayed this around where I keep my garbage cans as well as on plants around my house . It kept the squirrels and rabbits away but seemed less effective on chipmunks and raccoons which really seemed to respond to the the shaker.I like the idea that this product , as well as the shaker , is natural and will not poison or kill anything . The smell alone is enough to make me take notice but is not overpowering.I now use the spray on my plants and garbage cans but I also pour the shaker product on the ground around my garbage cans and plants . Combined these two are very effective .	1
Living in a rural area , I have an ongoing fight with trying to keep deer , rabbits , and a few other critters out of my garden areas . I 've tried everything from human hair to mothballs , and none seem very effective for long , if at all . Havahard Deer Off seems to reduce the problem better than so-called home remedies , though even this is n't perfect . It washes off easily and needs to be reapplied frequently . Not really a good solution if you water the area daily , have a few nights of heavy dew , or live where it rains frequently . Of course this is going to be the case with anything that is topically aplied , and is n't really a fault of this or any other product like it , it 's just the way things work . Still , it is a great aid for `` training '' the critters to stay away from those areas .	1
I have used the Havahart products before and have always found them to be very effective in keeping the plant eaters at bay in my yard.Really the biggest hassle was that I had to spray so many things that my hand would get sore and stiff and I usually had to turn the job over to hubby about 1/2 way through.That 's why I was so eager to try the power sprayer . With the battery charged sprayer using it on all the areas that my yard needs it has been so easy ! The great repellant keeps the critters away and the great spray system means that my hands do n't get sore and I do n't have to look for help or talk my self out of doing the applications ! Thanks Havahart for being so ingenious !	1
This works great keeping the deer and especially the rabbits out of our garden . It has also kept the rabbits from chewing on the new trees I planted in the late summer . The sprayer works great and it is battery powered . It makes it so easy to get this exactly where you want it without waste . I 'd highly recommend for keeping deer and especially rabbits from the garden .	1
The mixture works , and it 's nothing too scary , but it has it 's limits.First , it 's not really for vegetables , due to its ' smell/composition . That being said , it totally worked on decorative plants . Deer came and left without a nibble . For some , this is a great scenario . For others , well the nearby but unsprayed veggies , not so much . There was an overall reduction however.Second , it 's not too cheap . It 's not the priciest solution , but it 's not that cheap either.For a smallish ornamental garden , this is a great solution . For vegetable gardens , maybe not.Overall it 's not bad , and the sprayer is the real deal . I loved it .	1
But I HATE the way they all flock to the oak trees on our property , and dig up the lawn trying to save the acorn bounty . I 've used other Havahart products with a good level of success , so was hoping this one would be the same.It is ! The sprayer worked great to cover a lot of area , and I 've noticed a better lawn . While I still see the critters , especially after a good rain , my lawn is the proof of fewer varmints . While it is not 'odorless ' as it claims , there is very little scent.Thanks , Havahart !	1
We moved to a rural property last year . We have deer , jack rabbits , wild turkeys and more . It 's been a challenge to keep them away from the roses and other flowers around the house . We also have a garden , but we have a 'deer fence ' around it.I 've used Deer Off on the rose and other flowers , and around the garden fence , to discourage the rabbits and squirrels from going under . I do n't have a lot growing yet , it 's still early , but it does seem to be helping . I 'm so glad I have this for when the veggie garden gets going ! I do like the battery powered sprayer as well.It 's very strong smelling when you first spray it , it uses garlic , hot pepper and rotten egg scents to keep the animals away . And I like that as we have dry summers , I wo n't have to reapply that often . Recommended .	1
The battery-operated pump is worth the price ! No more hand cramps ! pre-mixed solution means no messy measuring and mixing . Easy ! Will it keep deer away ? This year has been pretty harsh in my area on deer , and they are eating everything , even the plants that deer are supposed to not like ( hostas etc . ) I live in a rather rural area with three acres , so deer frequent my back yard . They hop right over the fence . They have still nibbled a bit on what plants were left , but this stuff definitely steered them to other un-sprayed plants.Be sure you are up-wind when you spray . The stuff smells nasty ( like rotten eggs . )	1
We have a severe problem with deer at our house , which is in a heavily wooded area . Deer would come in and chew on many of the plants , even those that deer are not supposed to like . We have tried many kinds of deer repellent , with poor results so far . The Havahart Deer Off , applied to some plants that the deer seemed particularly attracted to , did reduce grazing . I see that some people complain of the smell , but I did n't really notice anything . The primary ingredient is eggs.The battery-powered sprayer worked well , though the assembly instructions were not as clear as I would have liked .	1
Initially I was going to give this product a 1 or 2 star review , but after observing a little more closely , clarity came . See below ... I sprayed half of the container along a 50 ft backyard area which is only open on one side , the other two sides being neighbors privacy fences , and around some flower beds . The result 2 days later ( and reason for threat of 1 star ) was finding glistening deer droppings in my yard and a favorite plant on my deck eaten down to the nub . This was the first time I 'd found deer droppings in my yard . My very first thought ... . `` I 've been trolled by a fricking deer ! ! '' . Soon as I spray this stuff , they defecate in my yard and eat plants on my deck.After breathing a little ( and resisting the urge to get a gun ) , I looked closer and realized that the deer ( other than crossing over a barrier of spray to keep them out of my yard ) had not eaten any plants near where I sprayed this product . In fact , for the first time they went to my front yard and ate all my plants there.The obvious lesson learned here for me , spray everywhere I do n't want them to eat and the spray does not act like a fence , keeping them out of areas.Still , I 'm convinced I was trolled by a deer .	1
In most years all of my daylilies have been eaten by mid June . Tulips are gone far earlier , of course , and hostas sometimes last into July . So far my army of Mr . Potato Heads and regular spraying with Havahart Deer Off have been keeping those pesky deer away . I 'm even confident that they 'll stay away this year as long as I remember to respray after heavy rains and to shake the Deer Off solution before spraying.Since I have quite a few patches of daylilies scattered all over Spud Acrres , spraying them by hand can tire these fingers quickly . I am crazy about the battery powered sprayer on the Deer Off . It took a few seconds to prime the sprayer and to adjust the spray to my preference , but now it comes out perfectly . Another convenient feature is that the batteries are not only included but also installed.After using up all of this batch of Deer Off , I 'll definitely buy more to replace that which was used . Even those who become disenchanted with the Havahart deer/squirrel deterrent will still have a handy sprayer to use in another capacity .	1
I have used other deer repellent products and found most to be messy to apply and the most effective one I have ever used leaves a whitish coating on the leaves of the flowers , detracting from their appearance . This one is clear and the battery operated sprayer made application a breeze ! So far it seems to be working but because my deer graze in different areas every day/night I ca n't be sure until I actually see them reacting to this product . That could be quite some time before I can testify to their reaction to it but when and if it happens I will add to this review .	1
Where I live , in a town house and a neighborhood , with a fence behind us with a shooting range beyond that . Deer ... do n't really exist in the area to any great extent.What we do have , however , is squirrels . My fiance likes to feed the birds . It took about 3 months , but sure enough , the squirrels found the feeder . We suffered through this humiliation as nothing seemed to work.Amazon Vine offered this to me to try out , so I did . And we are fairly happy with it.The battery powered sprayer means no more cramped hands ... which is really nice.I personally do n't love the way it smells when it is applied , but the results speak for themselves and after it dries , I smell nothing.And the best part ? After spraying the area around the feeder , the squirrels came around a little , but they really do n't seem to like to hang out anymore . They sometimes brave the odor , but usually they just pass on by . It helps that the neighbors have feeders as well ... so they have somewhere else to check for food . I would tell them about this stuff , but hey , all 's fair in love , war and squirrels ! Worth it for me .	1
There are two issues here . The efficacy of the repellent itself and the efficacy of the sprayer . I have used Deer Off for several years and it seems to work well when applied frequently . I found that again . I actually got to see my lillies bloom this year.I was initially skeptical about the electric sprayer . I could n't understand how it would do any better than my hand pump sprayer . I mean really ... how hard is it to squeeze the trigger repeatedly . Well ... actually , I love this sprayer . It allows me to spray a very even application . I think I am using less and covering more.. I do n't have the irregular large bursts of material that I have when I hand pump . I also have n't gotten it on my hands as much.So far this has n't clogged ... but I am guessing it will eventually . This is the downfall of the product usually . I go through sprayer after sprayer ( I end up using extra windex or fantastic sprayers . I am hoping it does n't ruin this one . You are supposed to rinse it out but that is very messy and cumbersome ... .. doubt many people do it ... anyway ... I love this sprayer ! !	1
The offer of this product via the Vine Program could not have been better . We recently removed some trees and to replace them we are building a new garden around around our house . For the first time in my life I had a rose bush . It was lovely , it has almost a dozen big red flowers on it one day ... then the deer came . Over night they ate not just the flowers but the tops of each branch.Our gardener suggested a chemical product but she was n't sure what would work . Deer normally did n't eat roses , maybe it is because of the drought and the hot temperatures . Then I was offered this product and thought `` what can it hurt ? `` The directions on this are easy to understand and it came with four batteries so I could use it right away . The power spray makes this very easy to use and if you remove the batteries they should last a long time . The biggest issue is to remember that the spray needs to dry on the plant for at least a good half an hour and if you get a heavy downpour of rain , respray . Otherwise it lasts for weeks.It works ! I now have new flowers on the rose bush and it is healing from the damage . Granted it does n't smell so great at first but hey I want the flowers to look pretty even if I ca n't be there sniffing at them.Interestingly the neighborhood feral cat now loves the rose bush but is not damaging it in any way . Between cat and spray I feel like my rose bush can recover . Next year when the lilies bloom again , I 'll try this on them as well .	1
I had something eating my sunflowers that are starting to pop up , so I sprayed this stuff around . I have deer , possum , rabbits , raccoons and even coyotes lurking around the area , so I have no idea which was the culprit . Since I sprayed , my sunflowers have been left alone , but whether or not that was because of the `` Deer Off '' stuff or not is hard to tell . But I will give the stuff the benefit of the doubt and say it works and give it a four star rating . However , more testing will be necessary to be sure.The battery powered squinter is pretty cool , but I 'd rather just have a squeeze handle if that would save me money .	1
This product is very easy to use and it works in a most excellent way ! I used this around our bird feeder where squirrels were eating all our bird food . After spraying the Deer Off on the bird feeder pole and around the base , the squirrels stopped coming near it , and it did not bother the birds at all.Deer Off comes in a container all ready to use - no mixing or putting anything together . The spray attachment is a very lightweight squeeze-type gun with an adjustable twist nozzle to change the spray from narrow to broad . The power that runs this spray is battery , and the battery is included . So everything is ready for you to use right out of the box.The instructions are simple , always shake before use , and try it on a small patch of plants before wide use to be sure it wo n't hurt the plants . Keep it away from children , and be careful of using on a windy day because you do n't want to get this on your or on your face . The main ingredients are rotten eggs solids ( sulfur smell ) , capsaicin ( hot pepper oil ) , and garlic . The product says it is a taste and smell deterrent - and with those ingredients , you can believe that.The product covers 1,000 square feet , it is weather resistant , and promises to protect flowers and shrubs , and you only need to reapply every 2-3 months . It is not suggested for use on food items , but you can spray it on the outside perimeter around the garden to keep animals out of your garden . If you do get exposed , all you need to do is wash hands , face , eyes etc . with water .	1
This is a pricey solution - literally and figuratively - for people looking to rid their lawns and gardens of deer , rabbits , and other pesky critters . Part of the reason for that cost , however , is the inclusion of a surprisingly handy battery powered sprayer . Potential buyers might wonder if something like that is worth the extra cost , and I would say that for anybody with severe arthritis or other issues that make spraying or sprinkling this kind of product a painful exercise , the expense is worth it . The sprayer works very well , and it not only reduces the effort involved in spraying the repellent , it makes the job go a lot faster . Just be prepared to spend a little extra money on batteries - this thing will use a lot of them over the course of an outdoor season .	1
So far so good . I had no problems assembling and using the sprayer and I have n't noticed any animal issues since the application . My only concern is that we have n't hit the rainy season yet . I 'm not sure how the product will fare through our heavy rainfall but at least the summer foliage has been saved .	1
We did a pretty nice sized garden this year after picking up some old abandoned city lots last year . We prepped the lots over the fall and took advantage of this year 's unusual growing season by planting and trying our hand at a wide variety of vegetables and fruits.In our mid-sized rural town , we have a ferrel cat problem that like to use the gardens as their litter box and we also have squirels and huge jack rabbits that like to plunder the goods as well , and the occassional possums , but no deer.Although we did n't even consider or start using the Deer Off until late in the growing season , I really did n't notice any real control of the local critters , to give a fair assessment . We still have rabbits , but I have n't noticed as many squirels , except for the Black Walnut and Apricot trees.I still catch lots of cats using our garden as a litter box , which really bothers me . I did pick up a fewlive traps , which has really helped in catching some of them . We have caught quite a few , but they breed just a fast and this has been an unchecked problem for decades out here.To give a better assessment of the Deer Off , I plan on using this next year , early on , so that I can see if it really does work . As of now , if it has helped with just the squirels , then I am willing to give it another shot . I will post an update when that time comes around .	1
I have eight prized potted urns inside of our swimming pool fence . Deer are not a problem , but rabbits wreck havoc on my plants . The urns are a mixture of spikes , dahlia , snow princess , and fiber optic grass . The fiber optic grass is unusual and gets so many compliments , but seems to be `` filet mignon '' to the hundreds of bunnies in our area . I have purchased container after container of cayenne pepper to keep them away , but ( 1 ) the bright orange detracts from the beauty of the plants , ( 2 ) the pepper has n't seemed to completely deter the rabbits , ( 3 ) it needs reapplied DAILY since I water daily , and ( 4 ) daily application has gotten EXPENSIVE . So , I finally decided to order this Deer Off as a deterrent . I was so worried about applying it to my beautiful urns . I was concerned it might harm one or more of the delicate flowers . I finally decided to apply it to one urn as a `` test . '' None of the plants or flowers seem to mind the product one bit ! The next day they were still as healthy , happy and beautiful as they were before the application . The directions say the Deer Off is resistant to water and only needs reapplied every two to three months . So far so good . I have not seen the bunnies `` feasting '' since I applied the product . I have since applied it to all of my urns and then applied it to all of my hostas , which also seem to be a wildlife `` treat . '' I am very pleased with the product thus far . The battery operated sprayer is a nice feature so you do n't have to continually pump . The only MINOR negative I have about the sprayer application is that I wish it could have been adjusted for more of a `` mist . '' The nozzle seemed to adjust from a heavy stream to a fine stream . Because I was so apprehensive before using the product for the first time , I only wanted to apply a fine mist . Now that I have found the product to be harmless to my plants , I will not be as concerned about the application .	1
For several months a year we have a rabbits come and go throughout our yard during the night . Although they do n't seem to be doing any damage , they leave behind `` Beans '' ( poop ) that my dog always seems to think she needs to eat . Of course we pull her back from the piles of beans but every now and then she 'll get one . It absolutely disgusts us . We decided to give this repellent a try and have n't seen any new piles of `` beans '' since then . Yay ! I ca n't say for certain that this works for all the other animals listed but it certainly seems to have repelled the rabbits.Our only problem with this product was when we went to use it for the first time . Nothing came out . We kept trying and re-reading the directions but nothing seemed to work . Eventually we took the item to our sink and took the hose out and squeezed the entire length of the hose . There was a clot in the hose that once we got past that section it worked perfectly . No problems since then . It 's very easy to use.If you have a rabbit problem , I would certainly recommend this product .	1
I have given this product just a preliminary test and so far so good . The sprayer works very well and is very easy to spray in a jet or mist . I have used this brand of product for deer previously and it seems to work . What I have tried this time is spraying around the pine tree trunk about 5 feet up and down all the way around and then sprayed where the bird feeder is hung from a tree branch by a chain . I could shoot the sprayer up to the branch without a ladder . It has been about a week and so far no squirrels in the feeder . I have a few apple trees that need winter protection but it will be months before results will be known for the apple trees . So far the Havahart DO64MS seems to work as advertized .	1
Havahart 's Deer Off Repellent is an excellent choice for those looking for a kid and pet-safe deterrent for unwanted deer , rabbits , and squirrels . Deer Off features a battery-powered sprayer , making it simple and easy to use.The product features a dual-action all-natural deterrent , largely made of garlic , that rebels pests with both scent and taste . The 64 oz . bottle will protect up to 1,000 square feet . The manufacturer claims that the repellent will last up to three months with a single application . Both the Organic Materials Review Institute and the USDA have approved the product for organic gardening.While three months have n't gone by , I can say that the product has seemed to have kept the deer away from some of our garden 's prized possessions . The battery-powered sprayer is simple to use - there 's no need to mix or pump .	1
I live in a pretty suburban area yet we are frequented by rabbits , raccoons , squirrels , possums , and even deer . My backyard is surrounded by a 6'6 '' wooden fence so we only get the smaller animals back there where I have my vegetable garden . However , the front yard is open to larger creatures ( including the deer ) that like to munch on my flowers and bushes . My garden is protected by theHavahart Motion Detector Sprinklerand a few other deterrents but my front yard was undefended until now.When I got a chance to try the Havahart Deer Off II I hoped that it would cut down on the bigger critters eating my landscaping . I am an animal lover so I do n't want to hurt them , I just wanted them to go back to more wooded areas . I sprayed my ground-cover , the flowers and the shrubs that could be reached by deer . The spray was fairly stinky when it was being applied , but not overly so . The battery power was nice but I would rather have a pump version so I could increase the pressure of the spray to suit my pace of spraying.Once applied I kept checking to see if I had new growth on previously chewed-up plants . The result was mixed . The taller greenery seemed have been protected but something is still eating my flowers . We are experiencing a drought here in San Antonio and it just could be that the animals will ignore the bad taste when they are starving . Still , it is an improvement . I like that the mix is all natural and it seems to be reasonably priced . I will be buying more of this in the future .	1
We live in the woods and have all kinds of wild critters around . I 've had my roses and other plants eaten to the nubs by deer , rabbits , squirrels , chipmunks - and skunks have dug up the roots as well.I make a lot of my own tonics for flowers and veggies , so I 'm familiar with the ingredients in most liquid deterrents . The main one is ROTTEN EGGS , and `` Deer Off '' is no different . It also has garlic and ingredients from hot peppers . ( This product is much like `` Liquid Fence , '' which sells for a hefty price ) .Those are normal ingredients in these type of products - and the good news is , they are all-natural ( if stinky ) . I do make my own version of this , and it works well . But my way does smell like death warmed over ! I take eggs and shells , put them in a plastic container ( Folgers ' coffee jars work great ) , add a little water , and let the mess brew ( outside ) . BUT then I have to strain the goop out , which is gawdawful , add the hot sauce etc. , the liquid soap to make it all stick , dump it in a sprayer with water , and apply . Within a day or two , humans ca n't smell it , but the animals do - for about a month.You can go through all that - or you can just get Deer Off - and done ! Right out of the bottle , it does n't smell bad , so that 's a major point ( far less than my brew , and less than Liquid Fence ) . Also , it 's premixed - ready to shoot . My favorite part was the handy , comes-with-it electric sprayer - batteries included ! I opened the jug , broke the seal , and inserted the sprayer 's tube . Turned it on , adjusted the nozzle to get the spray I wanted , and that was it . Make sure you pick a non-windy day and you 'll find it easy to apply an even coat to your plants ( like my climbing roses that go up to 7 feet ) . I got my whole garden and flower pots done , front and back of the house , in about 20 minutes , with lots of `` juice '' left over for other applications.Best of all , I 've had it on a few weeks now , and not a nibbler , big or small , has shown a desire to eat the `` rotten '' result. $ 33 for this item is considerable , but it 's not that much when you remember the cost of your plants , and the loving care you give them.By the way , the spray is likely to leave a whitish residue on some of the leaves - not the best , but better than having NO leaves at all . And the overspray permanently spotted one or two of my plastic containers ( not all the pots ) .Parting shot - when you 're done , pull the sprayer tube out of the jug , put it in a cup of water , and let it blow for a minute to ensure it will be clean and clog-free for your next use.5 stars - recommended !	1
Easy to use and apply , this is a great way to keep deer and other woodland pests away from your prized garden items.Setup is a snap , simply connect the trigger to the bottle , and begin applying . It is batter operated so simply pulling the trigger sends a steady stream of the product , an adjustable nozzle allows you to apply anything from a light mist to sharp stream . It goes on easily , though after several days , especially after rain , you would have to reapply it . It contains hot pepper extracts so there is a bit of a smell associated with it , it is tolerable , especially since you know that smell means the sweet smell of deterred deer .	1
I 've been having a horrible problem with squirrels lately . They dig up the garden , chew up my iris bulbs , and have been systematically gnawing away at my attic vents.I sprayed the garden with the Deer Off II repellent and it seems to keep the little fiends away from the plants , but no such luck with the house . I sprayed the wooden attic vents but they still keep chewing away at them . I also sprayed it on the wooden fence ( which they use to hop onto the roof of the house ) , but they still scamper across it without noticing the spray.Oh well , at least the repellent is keeping them out of the garden . My roses and irises are safe .	1
i picked this up because we have had an epidemic of rabbits lately . They seem to just appear in droves , eating anything they find including gardens . so , I took this and sprayed it , trying to see if it helped . It did . Where I had armies of irritating rabbits wandering around there seemed to be a barrier , and they did n't want anything to do with it . I liked that and I liked the ease of use , which came from having a spray bottle . honestly , i never pictured myself wanting more of this but I found another little bonus and it is almost as good as the rabbits being buffered from my stuff.When I park my vehicle , we have a lot of open areas and fields filled with grass . This means you get a lot of field mice and they like to climb into vehicles and nest . This year alone , I have had six do that in my Jeep and that is not only annoying but awful . anyhow , I sprayed this around , avoiding the areas when my cats are , thinking it might help . I also knew there was a mouse attempting to build a nest again and I wanted to try him out . Well , he did not return at first . There is something in this that told him to go away and I liked that . Maybe its a scent thing , I 'm no mouse expert , but it saved me another dead one in a trap so far . So , that 's two.I did n't try this on deer , so I can not profess to that . Just wanted to note that as well , although there have n't been any deer here . Maybe they psychically knew and just avoided it beforehand . So much smarter than rabbits .	1
My flowers have lasted a lot longer so far this year . I never catch the animals in the act of eating them so I can never be too sure what 's getting them ( assuming deer ) . This year my flowers have stayed around . The season is not over yet so Im not sure if I will need to reapply but for now I am happy.The battery powered applicator is a nice change - no hand pumps and no rinsing reusable containers .	1
I find a lot of these products work if you keep reapplying . I have deer and rabbits - squirrels , too , but they do n't eat my plants . This is for ornamental plants , only , or you will have a tough time scrubbing it off your lettuce ! I do n't really find the battery sprayer to be better than a hand sprayer , but no doubt if you are spraying a large area , you 'll appreciate the battery power .	1
I really liked using this one..with the powered sprayer it made a huge difference in getting all my bushes , garden fencing , hanging plants , etc , sprayed without getting a sore , worn out hand ! Usually I also get the stinky spray all over my hand too from pumping the nozzle head..not this time ! I also like the fact that I do n't have to mix anything . This product says water repellent so we will see as I do n't get rain all that frequently . I do know that I have n't had anymore nibbling from deer for a week and whatever was trying to tunnel into my garden seems to have given up , we will see ! I really like the battery powered sprayer : )	1
We have rabbits that love to hide under our garden shed . Even worse our dogs go crazy trying to get at them so we not only have food from our garden chomped on at night but also have to listen to three dogs baying at the shed for hours as they 're taunted from the lapin-coated meaty goodness within.The Deer Off II seemed like a good solution , and with the motorized pump application was expected to be easy.Set up was simple . First thing you do is shake the bottle and that 's it for mixing ; no adding ingredients or worrying about stirring in poisonous compounds etc . You then open the bottle up , remove the usual protective tin foil and drop in the line that 's attached to the fairly small blue motorized pump handle.There 's a lock on the pump to prevent accidental spray and also a trigger . I was aware based on the instructions that the pump takes a few moments to charge but upon first pull nothing happened . I checked that it had batteries in it ( it does and it comes with four AAs ) and took them out and ensured the polarity was correct . After replacing them I immediately heard a whir of the motor so they simply must have jigged loose in shipping . A few seconds later the Deer Off II was spurting out repellent at quite a surprising distance - I 'd say around three feet.So I went around the offending shed area getting the boundary completely saturated and then getting some underneath for good luck too . I did n't see any varmints scurrying out but they 're usually out and about on adventures until dusk.Next day came and there was n't a squeak out of our dogs . Not once did they pay attention to the shed and that 's unusual . It worked ! The application is supposed to last ninety days or so but I ca n't comment on that yet but the speed of delivery and easy of use , plus the apparent working effect has me sold.The price is fair , there 's no manually pumping or fiddling with ingredients , the product is safe for children and pets and really helped with my rabbit problem . I ca n't say how it acts on the other rodents listed but for me I 'm a fan .	1
A few years ago our neighborhood was inveded bu bunnies . At first it was cute to see them on our lawn ; the kids loved them . But after seeing the dead patches they left , the bunnies had to go . We have tried many different solutions with varying degrees of effectiveness . This spray works well and is easy to apply . We have tried some liquids that reeked , but this one is not bad . Simple to apply and lasts a decent amount of time . Since our Labrador thinks the bunnies are cuddle toys , and our Bassett Hound is n't fast enough to catch them ; I think we will be sticking to Deer Off ( or a pellet gun ) .	1
What these products are is a deterrent . That means it hopefully keeps many of your local population at bay to protect your trees , plants , veggies , etc . These sprays are best used with other methods like chicken wire , etc . You also have to realize that you will still lose some stuff to these little critters but the idea is to limit that loss.In that case , I think Deer Off II works as well as any other critter off spray I have tried . These are best reapplied every 45-60 days ( regardless of what they advertise since that is a `` up to '' day count ) . The spray did n't seem any better than past products but I did appreciate the fact that you do n't have to mix it or hurt your thumb spraying due to the battery powered sprayer.I would recommend this product .	1
This sprayer required no real assembly , batteries are included.I went out in the back yard to spray these huge hostas that the deer have been feasting on.The spray was easy and smooth and even after a week with a light rain 2 days after I sprayed there are no new chomp marks . So other than it would be nice to have a refill to use in the sprayer , since it continues to work , since it seems a waste to keep buying a sprayer I 'm very happy with this product .	1
I love the deer that come around and I find their hoof prints in my garden I feel one with nature , BUT , they do ruin my flowers and shrubs.I was trained as a Master Gardener and I know what plants they eat and what they should not . Should is the word , when they are hungry that will eat just about anything that grows.It is easier to find flowers and or shrubs that they tend to stay away from , even though they may nibble them anyway . They may eat my roses and leave the neighbors alone so it is hard to tell.So the best way is go buy a deterrent such as this product . They all basically work the same way , one may be a little better than the other , and there are gadgets to stop them , they also work . The best thing to do is buy them all and try which one works best . Thanks to Amazon sending me an assortment of product so I could do just that.This product works quit well , but what I really like is the sprayer , it is automatic , too bad mine did not work for me , I pumped and pumped and nothing came out , but this was a gift from Amazon for my reveiw so with that said and out of the way . The rest of my review is as stands , just had to use a regular sprayer and that was not a problem for me , I did not know the sprayer was automatice before I ordered it.I found that it did not have to be sprayed every time it rained and it rained here a lot this past month . I only sprayed it once . I even noticed that the rabbits stopped chewing on my cactus plant.Remember that animals are similar to humans in some ways , one is that they will eat something that is not so wonderful if they are hungry . I remember the first time I had coffee , I thought I was going to be sick , then after a few more tries , especially when I was hunger I grew to love it . You might want to change products from time to time to confuse them . So even if you spray and it chases them away , after awhile , and if they are hungry enough , they will e. So sometimes it may not be the spray.I find this worked as well as you could expect from spray like this , just remember to spray the entire plant to be sure it is completely covered.I am sure you will be happy with this and it is worth the cost to keep those rascally deer from chewing on your prized flowers .	1
Squirrels can be as destructive as their smooth tailed rodent cousins the rat . I never believed this til they took up resident above my bedroom , in the attic . They have chewed holes RIGHT THRU MY SHEET ROCK CEILING , with one hole directly over my pillow , about 2 inches in diameter . So the SQUIRRELS MUST GO . Sorry Rocky . After spending a lot of money on pest control , having them trapped and removed from the attic , they returned . According to the trapper , THE SCENT OF SQUIRREL BRINGS THEM BACK . So , what do you do to get that scent removed from the attic ? Actually , I dont know , but I tried HAVAHART DEER OFF repellent . It seems to work , but in the summer , the attic is too hot for squirrels , so I 'm not sure . I did , however , test the product in other ways.REPELLENT EFFECT -- -The squirrels also go after the bird feeder . So , I tired spraying a lot of HAVAHART REPELLENT on some bird food . The squirrel came up to the bird food , SNIFFED IT , and turned around and left the food alone . Later , several squirrls came back and ate it anyway . This concoction will REPELL the squirrels , but not REPULSE them . If the squirrels , or any other animal , is starving , it WILL eat whatever this is sprayed on . This isnt a poison ; its just made from garlic , hot sauce , and rotten eggs . If you were starving , and I sprayed `` DEER OFF '' on some potato chips , you 'd eat the chips too . However if you were only hungry , with alternate available sources of food , you 'd be repelled by the smell , and search out other food . I also sprayed some rain gutter pipes , which the squirrels like to climb . I havent seen them on the pipes since.HAVAHART CUSTOMER SERVICE HOT LINE -- - I called up the Havahart customer service hotline number on the bottle . I talked to a nice woman who knew all about the product and its uses . So , dont be afraid to buy this , and be left out in the cold for specific help . They know HOW to spray this , where to spray it , etc . When I told her I had squirrels in the attic , she advised I spray the product OUTSIDE THE HOUSE , around where they go in . The repellent functions like locked door , that repell the squirrels from entering . After they come in , the repellent will only keep the squirrels from AREAs of the attic , where you sprayed . You need to keep them from the ENTRY POINT . She also suggested I wear goggles to keep the spray out of my eyes , cover my nose and mouth , and be sure to spray on a windless day . To keep from washing away , the product needs to dry completely BEFORE it rains.PRODUCT USE -- - When customer service advised I spray this product around my roof 's eves , I wondered `` How can I reach them ? '' My roof is 20-25 feet off the ground . I 'm not climbing up and down a latter all day to spray squirrel repellent . This is where the BATTERY POWERED SPRAYER comes in handy . This spray attachment is unlike ANYTHING i 've ever seen . IT shoots a continuous , narrow spray of repellent at least 15 feet DIRECTLY up in the air . So , I was able to shoot the spray almost everywhere I wanted it . ( Remember , you can hold the spray attachment over your head , placing the spray gun about 10 feet off the ground for most adults . ) The height you achieve with this electic sprayer is also useful , if you have fruit or nuts on a tree , that you dont want squirrels to ruin . Best of all , after the repellent is depleted you 'll own a SPRAY GUN , for spraying insectide , fertilizer , etc . Its an obvious godsend if you have tendinitis , arthitis , etc in your hands.ASSESSMENT -- Ok , the product doesnt repulse the animals . I doubt any product will , without repulsing you as well . ( Or perhaps poisoning you or your pets . ) If you are desperate to try ANYTHING , to prevent squirrels , rabbits , deer , or other critters from destroying your plants and property , this is certainly worth trying . It 's best to use multiple tactics , ie spray the product AND use a deer fense on gardens that border the woods , or trap the squirrels in the attic , then nail closed the openings in the eves where the squirrels entered . I 've even seen people experiment with those supersonic whistles , or hang up plastic owls to scare rabbits from the garden . I 'd rather chose a product that isnt TOO strong , than use a harse inorganic chemical , and harm the wildlife . ( Poisoning wildlife is illegal anyway . ) Dont let these animal 's attempts at `` cuteness '' weigh against your determination to save your property . Those pesty critters are freeloaders that need to go get a job in a pet food factory as ingredients .	1
We back up to woods so I was not sure if it was deer , ground hogs or rabbits , but our squash plants were getting decimated . After spraying this on the leaves ( but not the squash ) the damage stopped . Although I consider the ingredients organic , I ca n't imagine the residue would taste good on your squash.One complaint - common with other reviewers - is that the sprayer gives a weak stream . For my targeted purposes ( Squash leaves but not the blossom or squash ) it worked out OK , but I could see this being a major pain if you were , for example , spraying down a hydrangea bush or other large plant .	1
Lots of times I have a hard time using garden sprays and pumps because of arthritic hands . This battery powered sprayer is really easy to use . The packaging , as a whole is wonderful . I like the plastic holder that hangs from the cap and makes it easy to store the sprayer . Be sure to lock it before storing . There was no wand with our bottle of repellant so it was impossible to apply a fine mist/spray . The main repellant ingredient are egg , pepper and garlic . I was disappointed that this could not be used on food product plants . We have a major problem with squirrels eating the fruit trees , veggies and herbs in the garden . I sprayed all of the trails that they usually use to get to our plants , the gutters , railing on the deck , stone wall ledges . So far , so good , but I will edit this review after a few days and update the progress.The blurb on this site says safe for humans and domestic animals , however , there is a little fine print on the bottle that says it can be hazardous to both.The produce is odorless to me , I just hope the squirrels hate it . My well meaning neighbor saved a nest full of the creatures a few years ago by bottle feeding them , now for the first time in over 40 years in this house , we are overrun . At least we do n't have a deer problem .	1
I use those for the second season now for my potted lime and blood orange trees.be aware that one hole spuke is to much for most potted citrus fruits , so I broke them in half at the beginning of the season and used them 3 months apart . When i used a whole spike the first year I had heavy but thin growth and some discolored leaves . I made some pictures and send them to a forum and got told of because I overfed the poor buggers . So , break them into pieces if your pots arent that big ... ..Aside of that a very convenient way of fertilizing.ANother small tip , http : //www.amazon.com/Bayer-701285B-Disease-Concentrate-32-Ounce/dp/B000VZQ3FU/ref=sr_1_2 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1404267488 & sr ; =8-2 & keywords ; =bayer+mite+controlkeeps the ugly buggers and sicknesses away ! Hope your trees grow as beautiful as mine !	1
Our trees have been growing at a much quicker rate since using these food spikes . They arrived in tact and not broken . Easy to pound into the ground .	1
unlike the granular citrus fertilizer of the same brand , this one does not appear ( at least from the labelled ingredients ? ) to contain any animal matter.so as other reviews have recommended , slice off a bit and put it in your indoor or outdoor houseplant .	1
I have my fruit trees in pots , so I take each fruit spike and break it in 3 pieces and just lay one piece on top of the soil . I water over the spike to distribute the nutrients once a week . My trees really perked up ! Outstanding value and free shipping !	1
Winter is coming full-force in Upstate NY and I was happy to find such a great , sturdy and ergonomic shovel on Amazon.This shovel is strong and easy to use . The handle is wide enough to accommodate a thick ragg wool glove with ease . The wear strip is a nice extra when shoveling ice and hitting blacktop or concrete . I have a much cheaper shovel and do n't trust it half as much as this one . The ergo design does help your back when lifting and pushing.If you need a shovel and are thinking about it , buy this one -- it 's great for fluffy and slushy snow . The capacity is pretty large -- so be mindful of your back .	1
I like the look , feel and weight of this shovel . Due to climate changes I have had very little experience using this shovel in the snow but it works good during fall leaf clean ups .	1
I bought this shovel from Amazon in December to be prepared for when the snowfall comes this season . My neighbor had one of these and loved the way it worked and how it made the job easier . I had to have it so I actually bought two . Little did I know that while I was Christmas shopping at Target I noticed them hanging there . Color is different but it 's the same one . Same manufacturer and same model number . They have it for $ 20 bucks . I bought mine for $ 27 and change for each here and noticed they have increased in price since then . Sometimes its better to get out of the house and shop around . You might get luckier than the deals you find from behind that monitor .	1
I have used this snow shovel once since I purchased it on Nov. 2013 . I have the old fashion kind for about 10 years so as I grow older mid 50 ' this shovel has served it purpose well for me .	1
We had a couple of inches of snow here in New England and this shovel is a back saver , the shovel actually made removing snow enjoyable !	1
I 've had two of these shovels so far because I wear them out . To make them easier to use , I drill the rivets holding the metal blade on so that I can remove the blade all together . Plastic on concrete or brick is MUCH easier to push , and slide and it does n't grab , which IMO causes more muscle strain than anything . Sure , they wear out faster , but I still get 5-6 good seasons out of them.If you have issues pushing it , do as I stated above . It makes a good shovel great !	1
This is a nice garden accessory , raising a sprinkler at edging , around flowers , or just in taller grass for better coverage . It 's powder-coated metal with a brass hose fitting , pretty heavy duty but still light enough to me easily moveable , even in annoying , rocky soil -- you just step on the crossbar and he two angled spikes push right in.The one thing I did n't realize about it ( it 's in the description , but not the title ) is that while the input is for a standard 3/4-inch male garden hose connection , the fitting for the sprinkler ( a threaded hole at the top , cast into the metal ) is female and only 1/2-inch , the wrong type and size for anything in my garden . You 'll either need a 1/2-inch male connector sprinkler fitting or an adapter to use an average garden sprinkler . ( I bought this one : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQG338 ) .I wanted this mainly to stand out in tall grass so my sprinkler or hose end would n't get mowed or driven over , and it 's perfect for that . Raising it up gives it better coverage.I 'd give it 5 stars if it included an adapter -- or if the title made its limitations clearer . It 's a nice product , but incomplete for your average gardener as it is .	1
I already had some sprinkler stands ... which I thought were good , but after I received this Yard Butler sprinkler stand , I realize that they 're kind of junky.First , this Yard Butler has the hose nut tightener built in , meaning that when hooking up the hose , you spin the connector , and it screws to connect to the hose . My other stand makes you spin the entire stand to connect to hose , which I now realize is ridiculous.Also , this stand , as you can see in the picture , has two connections with the dirt you 're putting it in ... if you have somewhat soft soil and/or incredible water pressure , this is also handy . ( Again , with my other stand , it 's a single stake that you press into the dirt , and when turning on the water , the initial burst often makes the entire stand jerk to an undesired angle . ) So all in all , this Yard Butler is better than my other stands , is quite high quality , and does a great job . Would recommend !	1
We have very hard clay soil with rocks , so ca n't use this everywhere . I like it a lot to water new grass , etc , in bare patches because it keeps the sprinkler cleaner . I 'm not sure why you would want it for an established lawn . It just seems like an extra step .	1
Not much to say about this - but it is well built , solid construction . I like that when it is pushed in the ground that the sprinkler is above ground quite a bit ( maybe 6 inch ) . Gives the sprinkler a little more coverage capability .	1
This is a nice cover to protect my Q-220 when transporting it or storing it . Wraps around tight and also helps keep the lid from bouncing around .	1
If you have a q you need a cover to protect it and this gets the job done . Very easy to put on and it 's held up for a couple of years .	1
This covers the grill nicely as one would expect as it is made specifically for the grill . I hope it holds up to wear and tear over time .	1
I leave my Q220 outside all year with this cover on . It works great ! I also use this when camping . A small investment for a great product .	1
I 've been feeding birds for almost the last twenty years , and I 've continued to look for the perfect feeder during that whole time . This sturdy all-metal feeder is close though not perfect . Most notably it does n't actually deter squirrels entirely as advertised , but it DOES discourage them.The feeder is very solidly constructed , very heavy , all-metal , and the hanging loop is just the right size to fit on the hook of my bird-feeding post , with the loop snug enough so local racoons ca n't pull it off . The design does not allow for a post-mount.The design works by placing a metal grid over the sunflower seed ( about an inch deep ) . You pour seed into the feeder , shift the grid around so it 's sitting on top of the seed , and voila ! The birds on top of the grid can put their beaks through to get seeds from the bottom of the feeder but squirrels ca n't quite reach the bottom with their little arms . Unless you overfill the feeder , in which case the squirrels can reach from the sides of the grid.The problem that makes this feeder not truly squirrel-proof is that if a squirrel sits on one edge , the feeder tilts , the seed slides to that side , and the squirrel can now reach the heaped seed . My squirrels discovered this technique within just a few days.Even so , the squirrels are n't able to get to ALL of the seed ... just much of it . So it slows down your seed disappearing , and it is extra work for the squirrels , so they do n't park on the feeder quite the way they would with an unprotected one . So squirrel-discouragement rather than squirrel-deterrence.Note you ca n't put mixed seed in this feeder , it is designed for sunflower ONLY . Mixed seed quickly clogs the mesh bottom.I give this 5 stars because it 's a great feeder for sunflower , but solely as a squirrel-proof feeder , I 'd give it only 3.5 stars . Recommended , but do n't expect to defeat the squirrels ; at best you 'll slow them down.UPDATE FEB 2014 : More than 6 years later , this feeder is still going strong despite having been outside near continuously through harsh winters , hot summers , thunderstorms , nor'easters and occasional hurricanes , and having harbored lots of birds , a number of squirrels , and even some racoons . The grate is still solid and intact , the metal shows some weathering but is still in good shape ( no damage ) .I 've pressure-washed it a couple of times and had to retighten the nut that holds the whole thing together every 2 years . That bolt/nut connects the bottom of the feeder to the hook in the top , and slowly works loose over time . When it has worked loose enough , it has come apart under a racoon 's weight 2-3x -- but no damage from falling to the ground , and the nut/bolt did n't even strip from that rough treatment . Definitely a good , solid feeder worth its premium price . Highly recommended , I 'd buy another .	1
Great pruner for all types of plants , the rolling action and padded grip do not cause wrist pain . the only con is that the blades seem to dull quickly . Would repurchase-highly recommend for anyone even if you do n't have any hand issues .	1
We prune spring growth to produce lovely summer foliage as well as use pruners to deadhead summer flowers . This prunter cuts precisely and the handle is ergonomically friendly for hands that have arthritis . I noticed the Arthritis Foundation logo on the package when I purchased and that was another plus for me . I particularly like the lock on the handle that retains the blades in a closed , safe position . For what I use the pruner for , I would n't want any larger size .	1
I have about an acre of land and it feels like I am pruning much of the time . It was a strenuous and disheartening process as my hand always hurt badly afterwards , and the process of pruning was such a slow one , as it was hard to close the shears.Enter the Fiskars power gear soft grip pruner ... wow ! This little guy makes pruning so easy , with the new mechanism they have put in it . I can now do my entire garden in a day and I have no pain in my hand ! To me , this is one of the best tools I have ever found as it allows me to be in my garden and do what I love.If you have any hand , back or strength issue , these are for you . Even if you do not , these are excellent clippers ! There are a couple videos in the reviews that really show you what they do . Do not hesitate if you are looking for a pruner . Have fun !	1
I needed a better pair of pruners . I had a pair that the handles had to open further than my hands could open just to get the blades to open up enough for pruning . These are way better and easier to manage . They are also light weight and have a more comfortable grip . I have to agree with another reviewer in that they do n't work the same for left handed people . I thin it has something to do with the bottom handle that twists slightly when you squeeze the handles together.These are super sharp and one thing I like about them is that when your cutting a branch they do n't jam up and you get the branch wedged sideways in-between the blades . Fiskars make great scissors and now i can say great pruners too .	1
Bypass are being used to cut anything `` green '' within it 's cutting capability , and because when you squeeze and cut , the handle you pull up also rotates to reduce figer fatigue , you might lose grip when wearing gloves , so remember to use this line of pruner bare handed , cuts great under normal posture , also with palm down position , not so when palm facing up , so you switching hands to do the job , and that 's when you will find out the power gear handle only rotates clockwise , and the design is not useful in your left hand , so left hand user beware .	1
It 's a bit small for my hand , but it works great and I love the way you just have to curl your fingers to work it .	1
If you need to spray under the leaf ( which is where most critters hide ) the design of this unit is great . Easy to load and use . Has a lot of parts so do n't lose the parts list . Hand for that evening walk in the garden also as it is easy to carry and use . Does not replace the tank sprayer for major tasks but handy for spot treatments etc . Very handy to have .	1
I used this to apply water repellant ( 303 Products 30674 High Tech Fabric Guard with Water Repellant - 1 Gallon ) on our outdoor furniture . Does n't clog , goes on very easy with a few pumps . I like the adjustable spray option and direction . Very helpful for hard to reach areas . Great product !	1
Have to say i have not used this yet.But taking itout of te boxi wa like wow frigen awesome ! Totally is better than describedand pictured ... ..Cant wait to use it.Ivehad spider mites and the plants need t be sprayed with killig agents yes purchased thru amazon ... ... And to nevr hav bugsagain i plan on spraying them a couiple times to prevent any invading my crop again ... ... .But when i used acnventinal sprayer gt itall over myself gtting undeneath leaves which is a must ... ... Soooooo i love this prouduct and cat wait to use it !	1
This is a well made sprayer with a comfortable balanced feel when spraying . Some smaller sprayer are awkward to use , but this makes spraying a breeze . The spray is fine and even , it delivers a nice constant spray . It is possible to lock the spray trigger in an open position , I 'm not sure how useful this is given the need to pump the handle every 10 seconds , but some may find it useful.The user pump the handle on the top and once pressure is obtained you press the trigger located above the handle with your thumb ; spray time is about 10 seconds between pumping.One reviewer commented on the opening being too small , but I do not find this is the case . It was more than adequate to fill the 1 gallon tank without spilling anything .	1
I have one hanging outside my office window , and all days I get to watch beautiful goldfinches eating upside down . It is magnificent sight when you get 8 or more on there at a time.What really is fun to watch are many other small birds trying desperately to learn to eat upside down . It really is a hoot ! A great part about this feeder is the bigger birds can not bully the finches around.On the downside , the unit is made of very cheap plastic . The bottom , that hold the seeds in , is A kind of a `` V '' shaped ( cone ) piece of plastic that is not at all sturdy . Some reviewers mentioned adding a rod under the bottom to prevent it rom falling out . That is a good idea , but I am thinking glue might work also.Another downside is if you live in a very warm climate like I do , is the top might crack from the sun . That said , this is one of but a few feeders like this , ans since it prevents my goldfinches from being bothered I gave it a high rating . It lost a point on quality.Luckily , for $ 10 , I am not out a lot of money when it eventually breaks ( it will ) . So , if you want to enjoy upside down finches , and are willing to recognize the downside of this feeder and can deal with them , ( I buy two at a time ) , enjoy ! However , if these things will make you crazy , find another feeder . There is a cool triple tube finch feeder I bought on here also . It works very well , but you go through thistle very fast . Also , it 's caps crack after a summer in the sun also , and it is much more expensive . Have fun ! ! If my review helped you , please click on `` Helpful '' ( or `` yes '' ) below . Thank you ! : )	1
I really like this one because it frustrates all the other birds and drives the squirrels nuts . My wife hates the squirrels , so she really likes this one . We finally got several goldies to show , so we are very pleased .	1
I sold these for years . I also keep one in my back yard all the time . Recently I could not get them so I checked out amazon and there these were . These seem to be fairly priced so I went for it . Finch Birds prefer these feeders over any other finch feeders because finch like to eat upside down . Plus other birds do n't like this feeder .	1
This gold finch feeder is a blast ! These little cuties do hang upside down to feed and I find it very entertaining to watch . There is an extra benefit to this feeder ... the little holes make it just about impossible for the large birds to steal the food . Oh yea , the feeder is made out of plastic as well as the perches , but I have absolutely no complaints in regards to the quality of the feeder for the money . Just use common sense for leaving it out under certain weather circumstances ... it can not tolerate below freezing temperatures .	1
This is my 3rd one of these . I like the way it attracts ONLY Gold finches . Normal finch feeders attract too many house finches for my taste . These things last about 3-4 years , then the plastic gets a bit brittle . Wish they were a tad more durable . But , it is inexpesive and it WORKS . Thistle is getting a bit expensive . I have found that I can make it last longer by sliding the perches over to one side or the other and metering how many birds I get at a time , especially limiting the feeding on the backside facing away from me . I still get plenty of goldfinch entertainment . It is kind of like your own private Parakeet aviary .	1
A shovel is a shovel is a shovel , right ? Yeah , I thought so too until I ordered and tried this one.Our yard is mostly a thin layer of topsoil over hard clay with some flint gravel mixed in , plus lots of thick , tough roots . Digging is such a chore that over the years I 've done very little of it.When I broke the wooden handle on our heirloom shovel , I read the reviews and decided to order this one . At least , I thought , since it 's all steel I wo n't be breaking another handle.It arrived and I immediately grumbled about the weight . This is a heavy shovel . I wondered how am I supposed to do anything with this ? It 'll tire me out before I even get started.But then I tried it . I set the point in some hard ground , put my foot on the step and pushed , and `` shhck , '' the blade plunged down into the earth.I was mildly stunned , and delighted . I had never had that experience with a shovel before . The heavy weight of the shovel was actually working for me , not against me.As I said in the heading , I love tools that work , and this one worked . Over the last few months I 've done more digging and have moved more plants and shrubs than I have in , well , as long as I can remember . Digging holes is such a pleasure now -- if you can believe that -- that I forget about the weight . And even with the extra weight , after digging a hole I 'm actually less tired than I would be if I were hacking with the old , lighter shovel . It goes that much easier.The shovel 's steel handle has already proved its worth in the number of roots and large rocks I 've pried out of the ground . Another reviewer remarked that the egg-shaped profile of the handle increases its strength , and I can believe it . I 've put an enormous amount of stress on it and it has n't bent even slightly.Because of its weight , this shovel is n't for everyone . But if you can manage a regular shovel okay , and do n't think you 'd have a problem with a shovel that weighed a few extra pounds , then this is the one to try.Incidentally , there are a few hard clay spots in the yard that even this shovel ca n't cut . For those spots I use a clay pick ( similar to theCOLLINS CLAY PICK 6 lb . ) to break up the soil before shoveling.But the bottom line is this is a great product , and I 'm giving this shovel a five star rating.Enthusiastic over a shovel . Who'da thunk ?	1
this thing is one piece of steel , wide stomps with diamond pattern for boot grip when you dig in . It 's a little heavy , but if you want something that will dig in hard dirt , this is it . Consider it a back-hoe for your feet .	1
This is a good Tool , I use it on a job and it worked just great . The steel handle is much better that wood .	1
The steel handle is welded to the blade . It is oval shaped with the long axis is the direction of greatest force to allow a comfortable grip at the same time that you can pry it hard without damage . The handle , instead of just being attached at the top of the blade , is welded both to the top and to the middle of the blade , distributing the force evenly . The metal handle makes it heavier than an ordinary shovel but my wife says that the extra weight helps it penetrate the soil better so she likes it . The top of the blade is wide so it is easy to stand on it to force it into the soil . It is made in China .	1
This shovel is incredible ! I recently broke my shovel digging up a shrub for relocation - the metal neck of the shovel snapped in half . I started shopping for a new shovel and found this Fiskars beast of a tool . I never dreamed anyone ever manufactured such a heavy duty shovel . So far I love it . It 's great at cutting through roots or dense heavy soil . This thing is steel from tip to tip . Beautiful black protective finish on the steel . Handle is not round but & # 34 ; teardrop & # 34 ; shape for a comfortable grip . The wide platform step for your foot is great . Nice thick 14 gauge steel blade begs for hard use . Warning : this thing is heavy and not for the faint of heart and probably not the right tool for the elderly or less vigorous user ( I 'm 61 myself ) . I do n't mind the weight of it , in fact the weight facilitates the efficiency of the tool and helps drive the shovel into the ground and helps with prying and leverage . It appears pricey for a home use shovel , but when you look at it , hold it , and use it , it becomes obvious that it is a great value . Built to last . Hooray for Fiskars !	1
This is one well built product that I gladly added to my Fiskars collection . I do n't do a whole lot of digging but when I do it is mostly sand and soil . The wide foot rest makes digging a lesser chore than my previous shovels with the thin foot rests that were not as comfortable . Any projects that I take on which require a shovel are handled ably by this sturdy tool . The shovel is a winner and the price is right .	1
This entire Fiskars binge began with a hoe [ incredible product ] and then a rake [ excllent ] and eventually have replaced nearly entire outdoor garden tool set with Fiskars.My husband said we did n't need another shovel but I was so happy with the other garden tools that I bought this for myself ... I 've not been able to use it once because he immediately adopted it . According to him it 'digs itself '' . I 'm not exactly sure what that means but he brags about the weight and balance - says it makes it so much easier . The same applies for the square shovel . Super nice weight , well balanced , Comfortable.While it might initially seem counter-intuitive to buy a heavy shovel ... it actually is much easier to work with than a light weight shovel . The weight allows maximum efficiency so you do n't need to strain and struggle to break the earth - it does the work for you . He has a tendency to have lower back pain when working ( age related ) and within an hour this became his new favorite shovel ... .he quickly insisted on buying the square head equivalent ( every bit as good ) .The other major difference is the long handle . It seems more and more tools are trying to scrimp by on less material - this is a very solid , very heavy item with an extra nice long handle that is perfect for those who are a bit on the tall side . It also has the rolled edge to keep the foot from slipping ... lots of nice little extra 's that set this apart from the rest.Very pleased with the Fiskars line of garden tools - either buy two or do n't let your husband borrow it ... you wo n't get it back	1
The image seems to show a black rubberized grip further down on the handle , mine does n't have that . It is however very very strong , as an example we used it to lever up a rather large cement fountain base full of water so we could level it out , and the shovel was a champ ( maybe not smart but it was the only tool for the job ) . I will say that this shovel is heavy , heavier than the standard wood handled ones . For light gardening I will still need to order one not quite so serious .	1
I am impressed with this shovel . I just dug a couple large tree planting holes in our backyard with it and it worked great . I like the all steel handle - do n't have to worry about breaking like a wood one . The step edges on the top of the shovel are large and really let you sink your weight onto it . The shovel blade is large and sharp ( I know since I just nicked a service cable in our backyard and severed it before I knew what had happened ) . Being all steel , it is a bit on the heavy side but I 'd prefer to have a bit more weight and an indestructible shovel than a cheap lightweight one that is going to break in a year or two .	1
This is a great product and very solid , holds up to hours of work and stays nice and sharp . and has a easy design to hold on too . All steel and lifetime warranty .	1
I bought this shovel to work rough building mountain bike trails and work around the house . I get tired of breaking shovels so far this one is shining bright .	1
1- it is slightly heavier than most shovels . it has an stainless handle which is resilient , and slightly heavier than most.2- the `` step '' , which is a horizontal plane about an inch wide , makes it very comfortable to step on even when wearing flimsy sneakers instead of work boots . This comes in handy for the quick task when you 're not really `` gearing up '' for a full day 's worth of yard work.3- it is sharp , and remains sharp . I 've been using mine for a year , and it has n't dulled . We have very rocky and very clay ground and this drives right through the toughest of ground4- the all stainless construction makes it tough and resilient to bending when I pry big rocks out of the ground . no worries about snapping a handle like with wood ones .	1
Have used this shovel on several projects and it 's held up pretty well . Lightweight but sturdy and can handle lots of weight and digging . Very well made from a great company - Fiskars does not disappoint !	1
Okay - how can someone rave about a shovel ? I dont know but all I can say is that this is a BEAUTIFUL design and a BEAUTIFUL shovel . Good weight , shape and feel.WORRY FREE BUY - just get it .	1
Was so excited to get this as I have a lot of volunteer oaks to dig up and a pine I want to move so when it arrived today I pounced on the box and went to town on the pine . My well pump has a problem so I was n't able to soften up the very hard and dry ground but was still able to dig down pretty deep in stages and the ledge is awesome . My weight was n't much help with the very dry dirt but it helped a bit and was pretty easy to find my balance on the ledge . The shovel has a great weight , it is a little heavy but imo that 's a good thing . I 'm not that strong and was able to handle this shovel very easily and although it is long it is also pretty easy to maneuver . Seems built to last , a huge upgrade to the standard .	1
As with the transplanting spade that I just reviewed , this shovel is excellent . It 's built so strong , I ca n't imagine it wearing out or damaging it in any way.If I have any complaint , it 's that the shovel is heavy . That heft makes it possible to use it for leveraging anything out of the ground without worry of damage , but it also means that simple tasks like moving gravel or digging plants in soft soil will be more strenuous than it would be with a lighter shovel that would be just as good at such light tasks.That 's a minor issue with an excellent hand tool . After my good experience , I bought one for my dad as a gift , which is high praise in my book .	1
I think I said it in my title , but I do n't believe you will be disappointed in the shovel . Just realize if you do n't really dig , you do n't really need to pay for a shovel this nice . I picked this one up for $ 29 and could n't be happier .	1
My yard is full of hard clay and lots of rocks . For simple gardening , I can usually get by with a wood- or fiberglass-handle shovel . But if I need to dig down a ways , or pry out a rotted fence pole , or dig out one of the many stumps we have in the mulched area , ordinary shovels break . I went through 2 or 3 a year , even trying to go easy on them . Then I saw this all-steel shovel , for the same price as the others , and tried it . Here 's what I found after a couple good work-outs : - It 's not unbreakable , but it will take a lot of hard use . I tried to lever out a medium-sized stump , and could feel the handle start to give as I put my full weight ( 250 lbs ) on it . So it wo n't replace a 6 ' steel bar for the big jobs . But it easily dug out many rocks , and a couple of smaller stumps , without a problem.- It 's heavy . No , really , it 's heavy ! Spend a couple of hours digging with this puppy , and your shoulders will ache like never before . You 'll get a lot more done than you could have with other shovels , but you sure are going to feel it.Bottom line : If you have an ordinary shovel now , and have never broken it , you probably do n't need this one . And if you are only going to buy one shovel , do n't get this . But if you already have a regular shovel for the day-to-day chores , and need a `` nuclear option '' for the really ugly jobs , do yourself a favour and buy one of these , before you break any more handles . Very highly recommended .	1
I 'm new to the shovel game , but having been through a couple cheap ones thus far I can tell you that this shovel do n't play . Sold steel makes it heavy but VERY strong , I stuck it under some roots and was able to sit on the other end of the shovel ( 160lbs ) and it did n't bend or show any signs of weakness .	1
I have n't owned a portable fence for horses until now , but I am impressed and liking this product very much . Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag , and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is . It 's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out , or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses . Once set up , it wo n't hold more than two of our horses comfortably . I do n't think we 'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises ! The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it . I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well ( such as alpacas ) , but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them . The step in posts are fantastically designed , the overall design makes the fence very versatile , setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.We 're very happy with it 's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system , I think !	1
I am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way . And I have never been happy hobbling my horse - I 'd rather she could escape from a dangerous situation , and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home . Sooo - here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds , thus is easy to pack for trail rides . And since it operates on easily-obtainable D cells , no problem being `` off the grid '' .The Fi-Shock HC-100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case . The long part contains eight molded , reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom , into the ground . Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet . Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set-up.A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps . It contains 100 ' of conductive tape on a reel ( no , I do n't know why the product description says 200 ' ) , the transformer of nicely molded , durable-looking green plastic , a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground , a shoulder strap , and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they could n't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape . Properly set up , the paddock 's batteries did not drain . Of course I carried extras . I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents . Of course I had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose . No problem.This worked ... for ONE not-huge horse who is trained to electric fences , so she does n't challenge them . Sure , any beast of her size could easily break out , but I 'd want her to if in danger . No , I ca n't see how the stated 4 or 5 horses could be contained in this enclosure . But this a viable solution on the trail , for my mare .	1
It may be an odd way to start a review , but since it 's the first impression ( and it was a good one ) , I 'll say that the carrying case on this unit is brilliant . The shoulder strap , well-placed handle , and easy functioning zipper are all sturdy make transporting this portable paddock a snap . Total weight is amazingly less than your standard camping tent.Set-up is also remarkably easy , even to the unitiated . First timers might want to budget 30-45 minutes but after a time or two you should be able to secure the structure within 10-15 minutes ( depending on your terrain ) .The fact that this operates on 2 `` D '' cell batteries is remarkable , making this kit truly portable . The product description states it will operate for 30 days on those 2 `` D '' s ( amazing ! ) . I have not tested mine for nearly that long , but bringing a spare pair of batteries would n't be a hardship , I 'm sure.I 'd have some concerns about the integrity of this kit if you 're trying to pen a `` spirited '' animal . Make no mistake : this is no fence . A more docile horse ( or other animal ) with electric fence training/experience will be safe and secure with this well-designed gear .	1
This product is both effective and convenient . We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes . It worked great as a `` maternity ward '' for our alpaca millay and her new cria . We were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd . I highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future ! Please view our pictures we have provided in the customer photo section ! !	1
Finally had an occasion to bring out my Loppers after some heavy wind knocked down a big limb . I am a 66 year old female and admit I was a little afraid but using the Loppers was as easy as advertised . What really impressed me was how little noise was produced . I was expecting the usual loud chainsaw racket . If I needed to use them for an extending period of time I would need a rest because of the weight , but for ten or fifteen minutes my arms held up just fine and the limb was cut in short order . Trimmed a dead limb on a holly tree while I was at it . This is a great addition to my yard equipment arsenal .	1
I have been using this for over a year and it has cut through all my branches and small shrubs without any issues . It makes very quick work of anything . Anyone can use it , my wife cut many branches and I pulled on them . Not always a clean cut when stressing the branch by pulling down , but 95 % of the time I have clean cuts.One issue is just the cord like all plug-in electric tools , just put it over your shoulder to keep it away from being cut.Do n't forget chain oil , do n't let it get dried out.I let my father borrow mine and was lucky to get it back so I had to buy him one . He took an all day job removing dead lilac bushes and turned it into an hour job cutting it down with this .	1
Used it to cut up downed trees for firewood . I had read the overwelmingly positive reviews before ordering but was still wondering if it would perform well when cutting anything over the size of a small branch . I used it on branches and tree tops up up to 5-7 inches in diameter and it went through them wonderfully . On some of the bigger logs , the length of the blade became a limitation , in that it would n't cut all the way through the log , but it still went through those without a problem and left just a little bit for me to hand saw through . Adjusting the chain was easy after it beegan loosening up ( as it should according to the manual during break-in ) , and oiling it was easy as well . With the blade guards I was never worried about kick back , although after a hundred or so cuts through various woods nothing ever even slowed it down . It was also light weight and easy to handle.Edit : Oct 2009 . Still use these . Other then adding oil and checking the chain they have held up well . Cut out a tree this spring and these make the job so easy and simple . I have an electric chain saw , but I reach for this over that one everytime .	1
OK , I am a sucker for gadgets and this one intrigued me . I had read about it in a gardening publication . The alligator lopper by Black and Decker is much , much better than I ever imagined . It cuts through a 3 inch branch like a hot knife through butter . Wow , this thing is great ! I would say the only potential downside it the instructions recommend oiling it very frequently and I nearly threw the tiny white oil bottle that it comes with . The oil bottle is inserted in the cardboard packaging and I did n't see it when I took the lopper out of the packaging . If you want to make cutting stuff up fast and , yes , even fun buy this thing ! I am so pleased ! !	1
I 've had this a couple of years now and it works great for my needs . I used it again this weekend to clean up from a big snowstorm we had a couple of weeks ago . It chewed up branches up to 5 '' thick easily . Ironically , it 's the little twig pieces that occasionally will cause the chain to dismount . This has only happened to me twice and was easily fixed with a 1/2 '' socket wrench and a little common sense . I have a full size B & D chainsaw I no longer use because this is so much easier and frankly less intimidating . If you 're a logger or frequently cutting firewood maybe you more , otherwise it 's really handy to have around . I ca n't recall the last time I added a=oil by the way , of course that 's probably not something you want to emulate .	1
Loved it ! Easy to use and a whole lot safer ! Sometimes you just need a smaller saw but this one is no push over , it cut through everything I threw at it and was hungry for more . Good buy for sure .	1
Men love gadgets , and merchants continue to come up with fancy but useless gadgets to sell them . This , however , is an exception that is a truly useful innovation.Technically , the Alligator Lopper is a mini-chain-saw with metal guards on both sides , one of which doubles as a clamping jaw . Functionally , it acts as a super-sized and super-powered lopper . It can easily cut through branches up to 5-6 '' in diameter in one pass.A recent storm brought down a sizable dead branch from one of the oak trees in my yard . This Alligator Lopper took care of it easily . I actually spent more time with the extension power cable than the actual cutting . Without it , I would have had to get a chain saw , which would be a lot more difficult and dangerous .	1
I bought the Alligator Lopper because I need to cut larger branches than my pruner could handle , but I was afraid of the regular chain saws.There were several concerns I had when I ordered the Alligator Lopper . First , the weight . I am a woman with weaker than average arms and I was afraid I 'd have trouble handling this lopper . No problem there . It turns out to be much lighter than I expected.Second , the mechanics . I was n't sure if a lot of tinkering would be necessary . Basically , all I need to do before operating it is tighten the chain with the included wrench ( loosen some bolts , it tightens automatically , tighten the bolts ) and then add some bar and chain oil ( not included ) .My last concern was whether the cutting action would be too powerful for my arms to handle . Well , so far , so good . I can do it ! I cut a bin full of branches this morning and am just waiting for it to be emptied so I can cut some more . My forearms and hands are a little tired from working muscles I have not worked much before . Other than that , it was quite easy.I like the safety features . The chain is covered and I need both hands on separate triggers to turn on the lopper . An accident from dropping the lopper onto a body part would seem less likely to happen than with a standard chain saw.This was a good investment for me . My trees are going to look a lot nicer when I 'm done with them .	1
This was one of the best yard products I have ever purchased . It is good quality -- I personally like Black & Decker -- not too heavy , easy to use and boy does it cut ! My neighbors have asked to borrow this after seeing me use it . Great investment for small overgrown yard usage .	1
Excellent electric chain saw . This thing mows through just about everything . Very safe design . Still going strong after tons of use .	1
Another update : July 6 . Well my almost 2 month old lopper continues to get heavy use . Very different from a chainsaw . Cuts smaller stumps right to ground level-read my full review . My neighbor , who never takes care of his property , has a poorly maintained pine . I recently had a tree trimmer slice the branches on my side . Now the best part . I used a pressure washer to expose the large roots on my side . I then used the lopper to cut out 6 inch sections from all those roots . The main artery on my side-gone . You can do this becuse the non-cutting side of the lopper allows you to get under the root , and the chain side then slices it apart . Not a possible task with any other tool . My axe bounced off the large roots . I cleaned and oiled the chain well after doing this task . Love my lopper . Original review below.The kit is a much better value . Get it instead while it 's available . I posted this review on the kit page . Just type lopper kit , on the Amazon search page.What 's in the kit ? , May 16 , 2008By P. Stein `` Bengals Fan '' ( Beavercreek , OH ) - See all my reviewsI just received my lopper today . I was very surprised and pleased with the kit . It contains : Black and Decker workgloves , safety glasses , a long outdoor extension cord , and a very high quality bag . I was expecting a cheap cloth bag . This looks like a high quality canvas or nylon denier bag with the Black and Decker name . Bag is worth $ 20-25 . 50 ft 16 Gauge extension- $ 8 , glasses and gloves - $ 5.00 . Why would anyone buy the Lopper itself , instead of the kit ? Go to the Lopper kit-sold on Amazon . Must be an item specially made for Amazon . Does n't exist elsewhere . Kit is not well described in description . One extra point on the bag . It is so useful for organizing tools and keeping them clean , I wanted to buy more and googled it . Apparently it 's not available separately . It is on EBAY , but bags are smaller and shipping is high . Makes this kit an especially good value.I have quite a few low growing shrubs I needed to remove . They are very mature and thick . The woody thick stems are too low and bunched for a chain saw , and my hand lopper wore me out . This is a perfect tool for this use . As others have commented , lube system is stupid . It is gravity fed , so you need to hold the jaws toward the ground and slowly add oil . I did that , but also generously hand ( paper towel ) oiled the chain and bar before each use , as you do for manual oiled chainsaws . Buy a quart of chainsaw bar oil . Lopper works great for intended purpose . Does n't replace a hedge cutter . Works best for thicker ( 1/2 - 4 inch wood ) . I just used it to remove 6 large mature shrubs . They were 6 inches thick at the base , and I cut them going around in a circle . Worked great . The very thin woody stems kept catching in the Lopper , but I could keep cutting , and removed them after the cutting . Use a Hedge trimmer on the thin stems , before you get to the lopper sized stems . You really need separate tools for each task . I have this lopper , a hedge trimmer , an electric chain saw , a gas chain saw , and a Fiskar pruner . Stay away from tools that claim to do it all . My preferred order of use is : 1 . Hedge trimmer when possible-for speed and safety . 2 . Lopper ( for safety ) . 3 . Electric chainsaw ( for safety . 4 . Gas chain saw ( when all else fails ) .This is one of the most useful items I have ever purchased . I have been using it constantly since receiving it . I love the way you can cut small stumps right at ground level . Just go around in a circle . I gave up on the oiler . I heavily coat the chain with a paper towel soaked in bar oil . Stupid oiling system . Otherwise-love it .	1
Item arrived promptly from Amazon . All items in the box . Followed instructions . Cut 3 branches and the chain fell off . Installing the chain in a 5 hand job . Got the chain back on , and cut 2 more branches before the chain fell off . Took the whole thing to a local hardware store , where the staff uninstalled and reinstalled the chain . They said the original chain was beyond dull . Spent $ 17.95 for a replacement chain . Went home and had the same problems . Tried the new chain , and again was able to cut two branches before the chain fell off . Sending this back to Amazon . I do n't know if I got a completely defective device or what , but a saw that does n't cut is worthlessUpdate : After a visit to the local Black & Decker store ( 10 miles away and gas is n't cheap ) it turns out the chain has two sides . No where in the instructions does it say the chain has 2 sides or explain how to look at the chain and see which side goes in and which side goes out . Since the folks at the local hardware store did n't realize this was the problem , I do n't feel so stupid . It turns out my replacement chain was packaged backwards , and the packaging did n't mention the 2 side issue either . For the 99 % of the US population that does n't use a chain saw on a daily basis , clear instructions on chains would be helpful.Update Two : Chain still wo n't stay on . I 'm on chain 3 . When it works , it works great . I get about 3 cuts , and the chain comes lose . My next door neighbor has tried it out ( he has chainsaw experience ) and it did the same thing to him . He says my unit is defective . I took the unit back to the local Black and Decker service center , and the nice kid at the front desk had never seen one . Boy , that leaves a customer with confidence . I 'm going back to the service center with chunks of tree limbs and let a service tech try making more than 3 cuts . It 's always more helpful with something fails for the repair tech.Update Three -- One year later : Now have owned for 1 year . I had a gardener who was a logger in a different life use this product . At first , he had the same problems as I did . After much tweaking and bolt adjustment , it worked fine . He loved it . I think there is a very fine line from great to terrible on this product , and if there is the slightest manufacturing irregularity , this tool requires someone with a lot of chainsaw experience to make it work properly . If someone gets a unit that just does n't work as advertised , I 'd strongly advise they have someone who works with chainsaws on a regular basis look at the unit before it is returned.I have still downgraded to 4 stars because I had to have someone else make this work .	1
Great idea , great product . Does what it 's supposed to do without problems . Highly recommended .	1
I have a relative who owns this tool and it is great , so I picked one up . It cuts through everything it is advertised for and makes yard pruning a lot easier and manageable than if it was done manual with shears or by hand . Some of the negative reviews are correct in saying that the chain does fall off occasionally , but not enough to the point where I will bash the items design ( once very 100 uses or so , did n't really keep count ) . Some of the wood chips do get stuck in the crevices of the mouth , but hey every tool needs its maintenance . As far as the bad reviews about the oil being a mess and nuisance , a little goes a long way.For me the PROS definitely weigh out the CONS in this product . If you are on the fence about getting this or a small chainsaw I would say go with the chainsaw because you will not like this product . Me , I have both so I use which ever the job at hand requires .	1
These products work 100 % and easy to adjust your balance up or down if needed , comes with basic PH tester but best to buy meter . Great product ! ! !	1
Nothing fancy but it does everything I need it to with little mess or fuss.I 'll be using it as a staple in my plant care .	1
I have a hydroponics setup , and I needed something to control my PH level for my tomatoes and peppers . I decided to try this since GH seems to be the best in stuff.It worked well , took 4oz of PH down to get it from 8 to 6 in 55 gallons ( I have hard well water ) . Just do not get it on your hand , I got a drop on my hand and it burned , there is now a red mark and it bled a little . Next time I will wear gloves.It may take a few times for your PH level to stable out when you change water , add stuff , etc , so check it every few hours until it 's stable .	1
I use this in combination with the General Hydroponics Flora Series and I love them all . My water is highly chlorinated and pH very alkaline ( 7.8 ) The buffers in the Flora Series nutrients will drop the pH to around a 6.5 on their own . It takes about 4ml to bring 5gal of my water from 6.5 to 6.0If you 've seen the larger GH bottles these will shock you at first . They are smaller than the picture lead me to believe but like the title says , it does n't take much .	1
this product lasts forever ! it is great for hydroponic systems as well as treating regular water . one drop treats a large amount of water !	1
For Hydro systems as well as straight nutrient solutions with low , or high PH can be easily adjusted with this General Hydroponics Ph Kit.to get it truly right you 'll have to test several times with solution your planning on using , yet once your amount is adjusted it is a breeze to use and work SOOO well.Thank you General Hydroponics and Amazon.Excellent price for an even better product .	1
A friend recommended I get this as I was having water problems . This helped me until I got the sand filter for my water ; )	1
I used this on a plant that very much required that the Ph be balanced , and it worked out very well . I would definitely recommend this product . I do n't see myself having to use any other Ph Control Kit besides GH 's .	1
This looks real cute hanging outside . I have seen birds eating from it.Both the seed and suet.The hanging rope could be longer , better . So far it is holding the feeder up .	1
The birds love it and it will really last . Holds a great amount of food . It 's close to spring and we have hundreds of different birds eating from our amazon purchased feeders	1
My only complaint is that it is sometimes hard to get the top off and to stay open while trying to refill the feeder . We also had some animal bend and break off one of our suet holders . Since they are only attached at the top it was easy for the animal ( we suspect a racoon ) to bend the suet holder up and run off with the suet cake . Eventually the holder snapped off . Minimal complaint though , overall we really like the look of this feeder , it holds a lot of seed , allows multiple birds to feed at one time and doesnt leave that much of a mess on the ground . Pretty sturdy construction , has held up after many severe storms here in Michigan .	1
This is one of the best feeders I 've got . It 's made well , holds a lot of seed and has 2 places for suet . The birds really like this feeder .	1
This is a pretty basic cedar bird feeder . So far it 's lasted 6 months and has n't broke , although I have n't had any issues with larger animals trying to get at it . Holds a fair amount of feed ( enough to last weeks ) , and it looks better then a lot of the cheaper or overly unnatural looking feeders that are common . My only real complaint is the short/cheap rope it came with . Replaced that with a longer/more durable nylon rope I had and it 's held up great !	1
I got an s-hook to put on the branch , and this slides right on the end of that for perfect height , so I can watch them from the living room . The suet cakes slide in easily , and the top slides up the rope for easy filling . I added red pepper flakes to keep squirrels away , and so far that has done the trick : ) I 'm pleased .	1
This feeder works well for the birds as you can attract all typed by putting the sweet cakes and the seed into it . The downside is squirrels will have access to this unless you hang it on a pole and put a round shield underneath to keep them out but if you do this , you should have no issues with squirrels getting in . The wood fades it color a little as well in the weather , so I would suggest putting some wood protecting stain/sealer to keep it looking nice all year round .	1
Birds love this as they are always at this feeder . Space for lots of birds to get food . Have made my own suet and birds come .	1
This is the best feeder Ive ever used . I have so many different birds and they love the fact they can get seed and suet in one setting . The cedar is an added bonus ! : - )	1
The birds and I love this feeder . Fairly easy to fill if you use a cup or a scoop . You will need an extra hand if you just want to pour directly from the bag.My dog 's behavioural improvement from singing birds is absolutely amazing and the feeling of a nature preserve for me.This is my first bird feeder , so , for people who are wondering ... .the bird waste has n't been that big of issue . There seems to be more urine where they eat , but not waste all over the roof or anything like that . Seed scattering happens , but they usually pick that up eventually . The sunflower shells are leftover , but will generally fall down within the grass or if you have it over concrete , you can sweep it up and hose down any bird waste .	1
I like the looks of this feeder , I have it hung from a tree limb . I have tried mixed seed for two weeks and sunflower seed for two weeks , all ten other feeders are buzy but this one is unused . I am going to replace it this week . It looks good and is well built	1
This product is a great supplement to the physical weeding you have to do with a weedeater or other device . What you have to do is to spray the plant on Monday to let the toxin be carried to the root center . Then , on Wednesday , if you insist on whacking the weed and not just spraying , you can go and tear it down . It 's crucial that the intact plant have 1 or 2 days to take in this product . If you cut if down and then spray it , you may well be spraying to no effect . It must be absorbed by a functioning leaf to really take effect . It does work , but you must take care . It 's impossible to have a spray just for weeds ; plants are plants , so if you misfire onto your prized shrub , you 'd better spray water promptly to ensure its viability .	1
First off this works as well as anything I have found . Cheaper than my local HD or L and for some reason it works better than out of these stores . Sprayed the area where I needed and the next day they ready to be pulled unlike out of the stores . I could not believe how well it worked with one spraying .	1
I 've been using Roundup Ready-to-use Spray for several years to kill weeds growing in sidewalk and driveway cracks and in areas where I have spread mulch ( such as around trees and along our fence ) . Roundup is effective on most weeds and grass and completely kills vegetation within a few days . ( It usually takes a week or so maximum to have its effect . ) It is important to make sure that you hold the sprayer close to what you intend to kill , for Roundup will kill everything it touches . I 'd suggest getting to within a foot or so of what you want to kill , particularly if there is vegetation nearby that you do n't want to hurt . While this pre-mixed spray is perfect for spot killing of vegetation , for wider areas use Roundup concentrate with a sprayer that mixes it with the right amount of water .	1
This product does what it claims it would . I had grass growing in the expansion joints in my driveway and it was easy to apply and it did kill the grass .	1
For the past several years I 've been using Roundup on the weeds and grass growing in the gravel driveway because there are just too many of them to pull . Recently a garden center manager on a local news segment pointed out that Round Up is one of the safest herbicides to use because it does n't linger perpetually in the soil.I 've since learned that Round Up is the chemical `` glyphosate '' and is widely used because it breaks down in the environment and is one of the least toxic applications to animals.For me Round Up is not the speediest of herbicides , but it does eventually kill unwanted growth . It 's even successfully killed some thick and persistent poison ivy patches on Spud Acres .	1
I had a problem with ground squirrels . This trap worked perfect , caught 4 of them in one week . Easy to set and easy to release . Have n't had any issues with rusting in 2 years .	1
Chipmunks are cute , but not when they 're digging up your plants and undermining your sidewalks . We bought the Havahart trap a few weeks ago and after experimenting with the bait , we 've been catching around one a day . Pecan butter works best . Just put some pecans in your food processor , and add a little olive or vegetable oil . They seem to like it more than peanut butter . Be sure to drop your chipmunks off far , far away ( like 4 or 5 miles ) or they 'll be back !	1
I have used other box traps for smaller animals and I feel this is the most sensitive , plate trigger I have used . I will be trapping night rats in the back yark . Smaller mice , that I have seen from my bedroom window , also feed on the droppings from the bird feeders . Squirrels may find their way in to my traps and be located to another area of the farm . I tolerate squirrels and will see that they live somewhere else . This will need to be seasoned a day or two out in the yard to allow the oils and smells to wear off , then , with some success in trapping , I 'll report back the results .	1
I have trapped 37 chipmunks over the last 5 years using this trap . # 1 , it works ! I use sunflower seeds suitable for a bird feeder . Not the kind of sunflower seeds you buy at a ballgame . # 2 , it lasts ! It is a little beat up . Some of the bigger chippys are pssd off when they get caught and really rattle the cage , so to speak . But the trap is still working . Just caught another one today . What you do with the little buggers once they 're in there is your business . I know some who then tie a rope around the trap and throw it in a lake for 5 minutes . Personally , I just take them with me when I am running an errand or taking a kid to soccer practice and release them . Whatever works for you.If you have Chipmunks in your yard you need a plan to regulate their population or they 'll get out of hand and ruin your plantings , tunnel under your sidewalks and driveways , eat your air conditioning wiring , etc .	1
very easy to use and set up and EXTREMELY well constructed . We had two rats running around our garage . Caught both of them , one after another , using peanut butter as bait . This trap will last for years to come if we ever need it again . Great deal , would order it again in a heartbeat .	1
I was surprised as I set this trap to catch a rat and it caught a fairly small mouse . Much to my surprise it was n't able to get out . I have caught from squirrels down to mice with this trap . I really like it versus the stand snap/kill traps becuase they are dual size . You need a big trap for a rat and that rat trap is n't heavy enough to trigger when a mouse steals the bait . If the rat hits the mouse trap they usually do n't even slow down . With this live trap you catch whatever enters to steal the bait.I dispatch the caught animal buy placing the trap under water . After 30-45 seconds the critter is dead and the trap is ready to be reset . While many people might use this trap to prevent killing a pest , I use it simply because it catches multiple size rodents .	1
It works great . I would recommend getting squirrel out ASAP if you plan to turn them loose . Also be sure and drive at least ten miles away . They are like homing pigeons and come back home	1
This little trap is so light and flimsy feeling that I was sure I 'd made a mistake in purchasing it . But so far , I 'm pleased . It is very easy to set . The first time I tried to set it , I thought parts were missing . I re-read the instructions and was incredulous by the way the trap door is held open . I thought it could not work . I thought that it would not hold and the door would drop down as the slightest vibration or wind . So far , that has not happened . I 've caught at least one critter ( squirrels , chipmunks ) each day . For irresistible bait , I mix cheap peanut butter with oatmeal , form into a thin pancake , freeze then crumble . I put some crumbs inside at the back of the trap and some in front of and just inside the entrance . Works every time . If you catch squirrels , you need to transport them at least 12 miles from your yard or they will find their way back . This is what I was told by the cooperative extension office .	1
The squirrels were eating my wooden fence . This works . I have thinned out the local squirrel population and moved them to a park across a river .	1
I got this to catch squirrels that were getting into my attic . Took it out of the box , baited it with peanut butter placed in a bottle cap ( to keep the trap clean ) and caught a huge rat that night . The result was no more noise in the attic . I shot the squirrel later.I know that some people will object to shooting varmints . Well , to each his own . But one thing I like about this trap is that you can shoot whatever you capture with a .22 and you do n't have to worry about damaging the trap . A little rinse from the garden hose and all the evidence is gone . The galvanized metal construction means you do n't have to worry about rust . Get a bigger one for cats . Shoot , shovel , and shut up .	1
I wish the larger traps had this design . I have two of these and over the five years or so I 've been retired I might have trapped and relocated 150 , maybe more chipmunks , and quite a few red and gray squirrels . I use sunflower seeds right ON the trip plate . Rarely has it failed , and then its probably racoons , who do n't fit in trap but they roll it over and get the seeds . No candy , do n't need peanut butter or the mess . Just the seeds ! Make sure to relocate the little chewers at least two miles away . Gray squirrels have a 50 % return rate at ten miles relocation ( per Cornell Univ ) , and reds a little less , but you need to get the reds covered fast , they 'll kill themselves pretty quick trying to escape.I even trapped a small skunk last summer ( not recommended ) but it ended well for both me and the silly stinker.Highly recommended !	1
I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard , causing no end of problems . I had a `` Havahart 1025 Two-Door Cage Trap '' which works great , but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population . I 've used the two side-by-side , and can tell you , that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1 . They like the 1025 so much , I 've left it out overnight without bait , and found a chippie inside in the morning.The 0745 is nice , but if you 're trapping chippies , get the 1025 instead .	1
This product is a great deterrent to keep biting , eating , pesty predators away from my veggie garden and fruit trees . I also have lots of CD discs hung on the fence and a metal cat on the backyard fence . I use tea bags filled with Cayenne pepper to keep the squirrel away from my persimmon trees and other fruit trees .	1
Works probably too well . It kept the birds off my plants but I was n't sure how to get the tangled bird out of the netting . Plus his bird buddy kept trying to kill me to protect his friend . The bird finally worked itself free so it ended OK I think . Just know you might need a rescue plan if you use this in a high bird flying zone .	1
First the good news : I salvaged the rest of my peaches from the birds using this netting . Then the bad news : even getting it out of the packaging tends to tangle it . The stuff kind of sticks together , and you have to be very careful unfolding or folding it up . It 's 14 feet by 14 feet , so for a small dwarf tree ( like peach ) it will easily cover the whole tree . If you are not good at untangling things , do n't buy this as you will never even get it on the tree ( or if you do , maybe never get it off without a good pair of scissors ) . It does cut fairly easily , so if you need to , you can cut it up in places ( but , of course , that defeats the purpose of the item ) . I would suspect , as other reviewers have commented , this would not work for squirrels as they would eat right through the thin netting to get to the fruit , but birds can not ( at least do n't think they can ) break or eat through the netting . So , you need to determine what is eating your fruit before you purchase this material . ( Birds , buy it ; squirrels , try something else . )	1
About ten years ago a friend pointed out to me that my Amalanchier Lavis bushes were also known as Serviceberry , and that the berries were both edible and delicious . A few years later the long birds got the message as well , as started eating the berries before they were ripe.I draped this net over the bushes , and even though it did n't completely cover the bushes , it did a very good job of discouraging the typical songbird . They 'd try to land , get tangled in the net , and fly away frustrated . After a while , none of the birds even tried . ( One robin did get tangled to the point of needing human intervention to cut him loose- so if that troubles you , you want to consider a different approach . ) I notice there 's a 45 foot version of his net for only twice the price , so if you have a large area to protect , that 's the way to go .	1
This seems to be good netting . I 've seen others who said the birds could still get through . I see the holes are 1/2 wide so they could but if you overlap it then it is much better and would provide a good barrier . I like it.Worth a try .	1
After many failures at trying to kill my moles ( I 'm glad I do n't have gophers ) , I bought this product . I have to say that I purchased this based on the reviews especially the one review by `` K. Chan '' . Follow his/her instructions and you will have success.It has been 4 days since I 'gassed ' their tunnels and I have not seen any evidence of more tunneling . That means I wo n't twist my ankle again . ( That was painful ) . I still have 6 or 8 solar stakes and I plan on moving them from place to place throughout the summer . I doubt that I will purchase any more of them when they quit working.Besides , even though I 'm female , I enjoyed the strategic planning and execution . I am very pleased with the performance of this product and the success . I will keep a few of these just in case the moles return.GOPHERS - the tunnel and eat plant roots , sometimes they pull the entire plant underground.MOLES - they tunnel and eat worms and grubs , but not the plants.If I have to use these again I will make sure to have a bucket of loose dirt with me . As the gas ( smoke ) moves through the tunnel it can escape through cracks in the surface . I will put scoops of dirt , lightly , on those openings ( instead of stomping on them as I did ... which crushed the tunnel ) .Great product , great price , success rate 100 %	1
Who would have ever thought that catching or killing a ground hog would be so much trouble ? My wife insisted that I trap him and take him somewhere else way out in the country . I purchased a cage and the first night I trapped our pet squirrel who will no longer let us feed him . The next two nights I trapped the ground hog and he was literally so strong that he bent the metal of the trap door and the wire cage and squeezed out of the trap . Twice ! OK , I purchased a bigger and better trap . Now the groundhog walks all around it and refuses to eat the gourmet meals I have put into the cage for him . Not only is he big and strong but he is also smart , wonderful ! Now I feel like Bill Murray in Caddy Shack and the groundhog is winning . By this time he has eaten all of my wife 's flowers , tulip bulbs and potted plants . Now it is time for war ! I can only find one entry hole in the front of our home in the shrubs so I find a large landscaping stone , then I tape two of the smoke bombs onto a stick and light the fuses and quickly jam them into the hole . Top it off with the large stone and cover it with some dirt and voila , no groundhog ! Now I am making sure we do n't have more of the dirt devils in our yard ! I used two of the smoke bombs as the hole was more than 8 inches in diameter and I wanted to make sure that the large volume quickly filled up with smoke .	1
I had a problem with some critter digging a fresh hole in my backyard at least every other day . I tryed many methods , but this is the only one that worked . I would suggest finding some type of tube ( pvc pipe ) and drop the bomb directly down `` deep '' into the hole , and covering it up quickly . Then place something flat and heavy on the hole to keep the smoke in . You will need to dig around the hole and open it up a little to make sure the stick gets in there as deep as possible . Bomb every morning for at least two-three days to make sure you get um ! ! Great product that WORKS and is kind of fun to use . Fire in the hole ! !	1
We have several acres in walnuts on our property and fight an endless battle with the ground squirrels which are very plentiful in our area . Used aggressively and diligently these gassers work pretty well . There are other ones sold which have less than half as much material in them , and those ones do n't work worth a darn.The hard part is making sure the squirrel is home when you do the job . The best way is to gas the hole right after you see a squirrel go in it . Follow the directions .	1
Had my yard full of gofers and purchased a couple of them . Busted them all of them out of the garden/yard . These creatures are nasty and keep digging and making new burroughs each day . The key is to close all old mounds and place this gas bomb in the newly created mound . I am glad that this product worked .	1
This trap takes lots of abuse and just keeps working . Does better than others and does n't need fancy bait . Our mild weather has brought out huge numbers of squirrels who are attacking my birdfeeders , chewing things in my potting shed and being very destructive . Because they have learned to jump onto the feeders from the deck railing it does n't matter that I have a big raccoon baffle , in fact that seems to give the squirrels a nice place to stand while they dismantle the suet holder . My feeders are squirrel proof but for one tray that encourages some bird types I like to watch but now I seem to be feeding more squirrels than birds . This spring we 've just been overrun and I knew I had to do something.I put the trap along the deck railing . It is relatively narrow , although long , and fits on the railing with only about an inch of overhang . I set it and then drop some birdseed in through the top beyond the trigger panel . This is super easy bait and lasts even through rain storms.When a squirrel is trapped , the trap usually falls off the railing onto the ground below . It stays shut and the squirrel ca n't get out . Even after having this happen multiple times , the trap can still be reset and remains effective . It is getting a little bent , but still works.I was given another ( and more expensive ) trap that was easier to set , but the mechanism rusted and it would n't spring shut . This one sat out in the weather for a year before I started using it and it is still fully functional .	1
I bought a smaller one last year ... garbage . Caught about 18 birds and half dozen chipmunks , not ONE squirrel . In fact they reached in and grabbed food without tripping it . This year got the bigger one and in 2 mos I have caught 21 squirrels and relocated . I went from them emptying my bird feeders every couple of days to no problems ... btw the feeders ca n't be jumped on and I smear the poles with vasoline but they run , HIT them and swing til they get the food out . A great success . Went from up to 9 squirrels in yard at one time to rarely even one .	1
I have only had this trap for two and a half days , but I feel safe in giving this trap five stars because I have already caught six squirrels and one chipmunk . I will say that it is hard to set the sensitivity high enough to catch the chipmunks and chipmunks can steal the bait . Still , this works because I have caught two squirrels when there was no bait at all . I have yet to leave this for more than two hours and not find a squirrel.Some other reviews have mentioned modifying this to make it sensitive enough . For squirrels I have not needed to modify mine , but I do try to leave the set switch on as lightly as I can . At first I tried to put the trigger just barely on , but now I put it on all of the way , and then back it down until it is barely engaged . That seems to work well for me .	1
Well we bought this to catch rabbits that have been living under our house and all we caught was a mouse cause he got stuck in the bait .	1
This is a good trap , sensitive pedal when set correctly . Peanut butter for bait and caught a huge squirrel who had been raiding my bird feeders . This squirrel was very large . Caught the critter in a matter of 2 days , think part of the success of this trap is the length which allows the entire animal to be well within the trap when the door shuts . Only complaint from me is that when the trap is set , the trap door extends downward so much that it restricts the opening of the trap somewhat ( perhaps an inch ) , making it smaller than the advertised size of the trap . Good humane trap .	1
I have never had a trowel this big . I just received it but being in Texas it has already seen a lot of use . I just planted 40 plants today and this thing is simply the best trowel I have ever used.It gets enough soil to easily plant small flowers and 4 inch plants in one scoop , yet is light-weight . It is like a mini-hand shovel . Then I just keep the displaced soil in the trowel reach for it after inserting the plant and place the soil around the new transplant.Now the handle is pretty big around . It was very comfortable for me . Not sure it would be super comfortable for ladies but because it is very cushy and soft it should be ok even though it is big . I do not work for Fiskars but they have become my go-to garden gear choice this past year . Have yet to be disappointed . Have your eye on that 6-pack of petunias ? Or severl 6-packs ? Get this bad boy then go to town .	1
I second what reviewer Robert Murphy described so well . I have a collection of Fiskars products including several trowels of various sizes . When I need a large trowel then this one fills the need . When I need a smaller trowel then I use one of my smaller ones depending on the need . The handle is comfortable , the appearance is pleasant and the usage is satisfactory . What more can be said about a trowel ? If you need a large trowel then get one of these . Recommended .	1
I 've had my share of trowels over the years , and my main complaint was that they were basically all too small . Sometimes you just need a bigger shovel , to either dig wider or deeper , and the 'regular ' ones just do n't cut it . Enter Fiskars Big Grip . I saw this in Target and grabbed it immediately ; I knew it was simply something I had to have , being a hard core gardener . I have n't had a job that this has been too small for yet , always planting and moving plants . It would n't be too handy if needing to move or plant something large , when a full size shovel is necessary , but every gardening tool set needs this trowel . Well made & sturdy , definitely one of my best gardening supply purchases ...	1
This shovel is the best I have ever used . It has a soft grip handle , which fits perfectly in your hand . The oversize shovel head is great for moving extra amounts of dirt for transplanting plants . The shovel is very heavy duty and I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great quality hand shovel !	1
This trowel is BIG ! The point is sharp . My garden soil is heavy clay , and this trowel is the bomb for planting and loosening soil . I love the grip -- it 's soft , but big enough to get some powerful digging leverage . Very pleased !	1
I have never seen one of these in a store ! I just used it today for the first time and I just love the size which is really large for a trowel . Yet it is really not that heavy ! I am very happy with it ! ! ! !	1
I love this trowel & use it every time I tend to my flowerbeds.It 's got a great , sturdy , rubber handle for good grip & it does its job very well .	1
This trowel is great and has become my & # 34 ; go-to & # 34 ; tool . The construction is solid . The handle fits comfortably in my small hand . I highly recommend .	1
I have just used it for the first time and found it very comfortable , much easier to use than the ones with the curved handle that make it difficult for me to hold . It is strong and larger than I expected from the pictures , very satisfied !	1
This item will come in handy if you are a home owner with a yard or garden . The standard trowel does work but has its limitations . If used properly and not pushed to handle too much it will not break or crack.Also as far as the California warning on this thing , you would be surprised as to how many items have this warning on them that you are not aware of . As long as you do n't go and chew on this thing you should be fine.Fiskars has a lifetime warranty on their items so I have no concerns if this items defects in any way.I also bought their 3 piece garden set and with this addition to that set you should have no problems with light/small gardening .	1
... from our front outside bib to the inlet of a faucet extender about 8 feet away.This 10 ' hose does exactly what it 's supposed to do ; what 's not to like ? Select with confidence .	1
Very well made leader hose that offers a little more length to hook your hose reel up to the faucet .	1
This connector hose came in and I installed it on my Craftsman hose reel . It works and fits perfectly and is doing a great job so far . The shiny brass connectors are a big improvement over the original connector hose that had grown old and leaky over the years.It also served as an occasion to service the Craftsman reel which I had been intending to do but had successfully put off for several years . The o-ring should be lubricated to keep it from drying out and starting to leak . In light of the occasion I also put a new hose on the reel and now it looks and works as good as new.The hose was shipped in very adequate boxing and arrived in perfect condition . If you 're using a hose reel this connector hose is a good catalyst for updating and maintaining your reel.I 'm very pleased with it .	1
I needed a leader hose that would reach to the hose reel at the end of my garden but the faucet is in the middle of it . None of the local stores carried anything longer than 6 feet so I turned to my favorite store , and it 's Amazon to the rescue ! The hose is sturdy and it connected to both ends without leaking . I 'm so happy I could cry , sniff , sob !	1
I went out looking for ten feet of leader hose and the longest i could find was six feet so i bought this hose and the quality is good and it makes it a lot easier to move it away form the house and whined it up on the reel .	1
This leader hose is long and connects nicely . I like the fact that it is a 10ft hose which means I get a little more with my hose in general .	1
After trying several other traps , sprays , etc. , this finally worked on our squirrel problem . Traps them alive after they go after a little nut we 've put as bait ; then we just drive them to a new location ( granted it has to be rather far ) but better than other options .	1
I have had this product for about a month now and so far , I 've caught 3 chipmunks . However , it 's worth noting that more often than not ( until my modification ) , the trap was closed , treat was gone and no chipmunks were inside . Though the bait tray is sensitive , a chipmunk can easily get a treat off it and walk out of the trap without it being deployed . Happened to me several times . One time I set the trap on some mulch and the chipmunk dug at the treat from below , again evading the trap.The tip someone posted about smearing peanut butter on the bait tray itself is a good one . However , it 's messy and if left out too long , will attract ants . What I did was take a clamp I used for my pet birds and secure it to the inside of the trap near the bait tray . I clip a little graham cracker with some peanut butter on it - that way , the chipmunk almost has to step on the bait tray and/or struggle a little to get the treat , therefor triggering the trap . He ca n't just grab the treat and go , he has to either sit there for awhile eating it , or pull it off the clamp , either way increasing the likelihood that the trap will deploy.For the price , I feel this is a good product , though I really wish there was a way to secure the treat to the bait tray . It would definitely increase the chances of catching a chipmunk . Setting it up is fairly easy , though not totally intuitive in setting the trap itself . Nice thing is reusable , portable and not messy.Oh , and I doubt a squirrel could fit into this thing ! It does seem big enough to catch a squirrel.Overall , a good value for those of us who do n't yet have the nerve to kill the little buggers . ; )	1
I have been hearing some critters in my attic lately and thought I had squirrels . I have the Havahart 1030 ( little bigger ) and put it in the attic . It caught something , but what it caught was able to get out through the holes so I knew I had something smaller than a squirrel . I purchased this 1025 and put it in the attic . The first night I caught a flying squirrel and it could not escape . Worked very well at holding him for a few hours till I could relocate it . The next night , I caught another flying squirrels . Two nights , two flying squirrels . While I love this trap , I really hope I 'm done with it for a while.The mechanisms on the trap can be a little touchy and you have to play with it to get it to stay just right , but is easy to do after a little practice .	1
My yard is like a menagerie of wild animals . So many birds we ca n't feed them all , squirrels , ducks , snapping turtles , humming birds but the ones I trap and get rid of are the chipmunks . They dig everyplace and can do substantial damage if they get out of control.I trap them with this Havahart cage and take them to a very large park about 10 miles away . I see this as the humane way of taking care of these critters . I use a slice of apple tied to the trip plate and it works fine and last for several days if they do n't come around . Every once in a while I would catch a baby squirrel and let it go or maybe even a bird.I have used two of these cages and the first one worked flawlessly . On the second one the trip setting lever was not bent properly out of the box and I had to re-align it to get it to trip easily and not jam partially open . The second one is definitely more difficult to set.Last spring I caught 6 chipmunks in one day ! This cage is much too small to catch full size squirrels as the door only closes on their tail and will not lock and the squirrels are very strong and able to escape.Funny story , we went to the park to drop off a chipmunk and we always park in the same spot . Three chipmunks ran up to the truck like they wanted to get in and my wife said that they just wanted a ride home . Too bad fellows !	1
Trap rats near chicken feed and cat feed . Also was surprised that it caught several smaller mice . would have thought that they could have gotten out but they said put .	1
I thought I just had a ground squirrel or two eating my plants ... I received this trap on Monday . Caught one squirrel Monday night , two squirrels Tuesday , four on Wednesday . Today I am told there was one squirrel in the trap and eight more trying to spring their comrade ( trying to dig him out ) . Apparently my property is paradise on Earth for the Antelope Ground Squirrel.I wo n't be buying any more of these traps ( I do n't have the time to move 10,000 ground squirrels ) , but it is very effective . While it looks awful , I think we 'll be putting a layer of chicken wire or hardware netting on the bottom half of our 4-foot wire fence . Then we 'll use this trap on a case-by-case basis.By the way , Antelope Ground Squirrels like peanut butter , green and red grapes , corn and Ritz crackers .	1
We caught our vole the first night we put this out , and caught a youngster the second night . I used a little peanut butter on a small cracker , and it worked . The trap was a little tricky to get set , it took several tries , but I finally got the hang of it . Glad I was able to re-home my pests , rather than kill them .	1
I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard , causing me no end of problems . I 've had a one of the 1025s for a while , and it works great , but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population . So , I bought another 1025 and also a `` Havahart 0745 Live Animal Professional Style Trap '' . Since it 's advertised as a chipmunk trap , whereas the 1025 is advertised as a squirrel trap , I wanted to compare them . I 've used the two side-by-side , and can tell you , that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1 . They like the 1025 so much , I 've occasionally left it out overnight without bait , and found a chippie inside in the morning.I 've caught squirrels in this too , they apparently like peanut butter as much as the chippies do . But usually the chippies get to the bait first . If you have chipmunks , this is hands-down the best trap I 've found .	1
The Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent appears to work . I have about 800 tulips blooming in my unfenced , suburban front yard . Well , not really . Deer ate about 150 of the tulips shortly after they opened . Then , I covered the entirety with bird netting to save the rest.Although bird netting is effective against deer and nearly invisible , it is n't invisible . It 's also frustrating . You have to continually raise it to avoid trapping the buds . Also , it just is n't the ideal setting for a beautiful garden . So , I jumped at the chance to test the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent.It 's not too difficult to set up . The Electronic Repellent comes with 3 `` units . '' I installed them among the tulips , trying to cover the deer 's path . A week later , the tulips still bloom beautifully , without bird netting . I reapplied the acorn scent to the cotton in each unit after a heavy rain , about a two-minute chore.Beware , the Electronic Deer Repellent could constitute an `` attractive nuisance . '' It is critical to warn small children not to touch the unit . Our neighbor 's three-year-old nearly grabbed the attractive red plastic tip , right below the shocking wires , before we warned her away . My husband then tested it as we watched . He felt a very unpleasant jolt , which would really upset a small child.Verdict : the deer are not eating the flowers in the garden . Also , there are no elephants in the yard . It 's worth a try to save valuable plants .	1
So far so good with the hosta and knock out roses . I do n't use these stakes quite per the directions but they seem to be working . The stakes are rather larger than I expected and have a bright red top so they are not exactly blending in with the landscaping , but if they attract the deer to touch them instead of the plants , I 'm grateful . One shock is all it would take to discourage them from returning to that plant.We 've had regular rain and replacing the lure after each deluge is n't practical , plus with about a trillion acorns on the ground , I 'm not sure that the deer would bother checking out a lure with that same scent . I hope they are just likely to bump into the thing while trying to dine on my plantings . The stake does give a good wallop when the top wires are touched -- the same or better than my electric fence around the paddock . I found this out by accident . Will be more careful in the future.I like that the stake 's footrest helps you plant the stack into the ground because you ca n't touch the top of it to push it in without getting shocked . It 's also important to put the bottom two sections together first when assembling the stake as they fit very tight and once the top is loaded for action , you do n't want to be touching it.I have n't seen any deer being shocked by the stakes , but I also have n't lost any of the new plants to their foraging . I see the deer close by , just not in my yard . I 'd like to think they find it off limits , but that 's probably wishful thinking . Bottom line , I still have my new hosta plants , the roses and phlox , which have been a regular deer treat in the past . I put a stake by each plant . I do n't know that you could convince a deer to avoid your property by stakes around the perimeter , but they seem to be working at specific locations . They are certainly worth a try in your deer deterrent offensive.Update 7/1/11 : While two plantings near the stakes are still untouched by the deer , the leaves on the far side of the third plant have been eaten . It tells me they can still eat near the stake with impunity . I 'm hoping that at some point in this meal , the stake was touched with unpleasant results and there will not be a repeat visit . Time will tell and I 'll update .	1
We live in the Blue Ridge Mountains and have an abundance of deer . My husband planted several fruit trees , and as soon as buds appeared , the deer ate them off . Several trees were so chewed up we were afraid we 'd lose them , not to mention other plants that were attempting to grow . We 'd tried motion detector lights and scented deterrents such as ivory soap , chimes , etc . and the deer always ignored them after a few days . It took about a week , but we 've noticed the buds on our fruit trees and other plants have been untouched . We 've also noticed the deer are now crossing much farther down the hill , far away from the plants . I 'm sure we 'll have to move the devices around , check batteries , etc. , but it 's worth it to protect our fruit new fruit trees and garden .	1
A few short years ago I was happily ensconced in the Midwest . Trips between towns would afford the occasional glimpse of deer ; sometimes we would be lucky enough to catch sight of a bambi or a stag . Imagine our joy when , upon moving to the northeast , we were visited by a herd of deer the first night in our new home . The deer were daily visitors all through the long winter . How lucky for us ! Of course we knew that come spring and summer our deer friends would retreat into the deeper forest and , naturally , we would be bereft.Well , spring came , and with it a pestilence of deer . Large deer , small deer , rutting bucks chasing females in heat - a cornucopia of strong footed , long limbed voraciously hungry vermin ! Nothing would deter them from feasting on my flowerbeds . Deer repellant sprays would work until the first gentle rain fell in the night . Come morning my hostas were reduced to stubble . Pepper solutions were apparently considered seasoning . Coyote urine ? You think they fell for that ? Nothing worked.We finally installed a fence and , to the kids delight , got a dog . Both have helped considerably . ( Yes , some of them do jump over the fence and would probably eat the pup if they could open their jaws wide enough . ) That said , the front yard is still open for grazing . I was pretty sure these deer repellant sticks would prove themselves unattractive yard ornamentation . The only action I foresaw was some high hilarity when I managed to back into them weeding . I have to admit these ugly sticks admirably impress me . We have a Japanese maple tree out front that has long been considered delectable deer cuisine by the marauding herds . We placed one pole to the front of it and then positioned the other two poles along the path leading to the front area . ( Yes , our house is situated smack dab in the middle of what appears to be a long-standing deer path . ) To date , the maple tree has remained unmolested . Now , full disclosure , I am still using the deer repellant spray . That said , we have had some terrific rains for days on end and I did not reapply the spray , so it would seem that the poles are helping.If the poles cease to be effective or if I am fortunate enough to actually see a deer get zapped I will update this review .	1
I was skeptical , but I admit that I have seen no deer since I put them out 5 weeks ago . What an improvement that is to my big garden . These seem to work and work well . I may buy more if I do n't see deer within the next couple of weeks . They seem to cover a wide area for me , 180 feet X 425 feet . I am amazed .	1
My landlord 's house is between two rental houses , one of which we are in . The land is beautiful sweeping mountain land they have planted with apple trees , grapes , and a variety of flowers and bushes . We have a communal garden plot as well as a communal chicken coop . My landlord loves the deer that come and has planted an area just for them to browse . But their well-worn path into the area goes right through the apple trees and too close to the tempting garden plot.We are under no illusions that the deer will go away , nor would we really want them to . We enjoy sharing the land with all the critters that come here and , rather than trying to eliminate nuisances , we prefer to seek balance in the ecosystem using permaculture principles and simple deterrents that help the critters make choices that just happen to work out better for us as well.What we are experimenting with now with these deer-repellent stakes is diverting the path of the deer so they skirt the apple trees and garden and head , instead , for the browsing area that ought to give them plenty to eat . I have yet to catch the deer in their act so I ca n't report yet on how effectively the stakes work for our purposes , but the fact that I have n't seen them at all is saying something . When the apple trees start to flower , that 's when we 'll have a better sense of how well the stakes are working at refocusing the deer . When I have something more to report , I will update this review .	1
These take almost no time to put together but you must read the instructions carefully . You put cotton balls in the top and put a few drops of lure on them . Acorn lure is supplied and it does n't smell bad so if you get it on your hands , you are n't a pariah for a day . There are loops of wire that must n't touch or it wears out the battery so you have to be careful to set them correctly before you put the batteries in . Two AA batteries are required for each post and it takes 45 minutes to charge the first time . This is an important thing to know because you might figure it does n't work , like my brother did when he put it together without the instructions ! You can test them with a screwdriver and you get a spark . After discharge it takes only 15 minutes to recharge . I ca n't tell you how the deer like them because I have n't seen the deer , but my plants are left alone ! Since they run on batteries , you do n't have to have them at any set distance apart , just stick them wherever your precious plants are being attacked . Evidently the deer become complacent with the same lure scent so you get info on where to order other scents to rotate .	1
This is a set of three posts that gives a gentle shock to animals . Setup took about 20 minutes and the weekly deer lure is easy to replace.We have roses in the flower beds in Northeast Florida . Unfortunately , deer love to eat the roses . After a total of 10 weeks , this product is still staying strong . Our roses are unfettered by the deer . Our neighbors down the street do n't have as much luck , and they 've tried everything . Now , they want to buy this product , also.If you have a problem with wildlife , give this product a try . It works with the deer who , before , raided our flower beds.Highly recommended .	1
I was holding off for a review of this product until I was able to see it in action . Waiting for deer can be a test of patience . But it finally happened . We live in a semi rural area and grow our own garden . I put these out close to the garden and wham o the deer walks up sniffs and zap no more deer . Havahart does it again . Recommended	1
I put the deer repellent in my backyard , and it seems like it might be working . I put it close to my berry bushes since deer really like to eat those and they eat up all the new grows every year , and I was really tired of it . I still see some deer in the area from time to time , but my bushes look fine . I try not to forget to add the oil to the stakes every now and then , especially after rain . Once I did n't , and I was able to make a nice picture of baby deer standing next to the repellent . So , yes , it will only work if you keep it charged because there is always new deer that have n't been at your yard before and does not know it is not welcomed.There was a lot of information on the package on how and where to install the stakes so they will work the best . It was a bit tricky to assemble the parts , I had to ask my husband for help .	1
I have horses but no place to store my hay so it often gets stored in the back of my pick up . No matter how well tarped it is the deer would get into it and ruin a good amount . Even parking next to the house and having a big dog here do not disuad them . I have been using these stakes for a couple of nights so far one on each side of the hay in the truck bed and have had no damage . I will update my review as time progresses.Well I moved some of my potted plants away from the porch and did n't use this product . 2 nights later they were all eaten off so now I know it was n't the dogs keeping the deer away from the hay . The only drawback I have found it that someone took 2 of these and laid them in a pile of hay and by the time I found out the batteries had discharged . The instructions tell you they will if they are in constant contact with anything . It would be nice if the manufacturer could somehow build in a cut off to prevent this from happening . Batteries are n't cheap .	1
I got three of these last summer and had my doubts that they would work , because my deer are so stubborn here that no scent-based repellent can keep them at bay - in fact if you want to chase them off yourself , you practically have to walk right up to them and punch them in the nose ( and even that scares me sometimes because I get so close , I 'm afraid I might actually make contact one day and get myself trampled ! ) Anyway I put them in some roses and hydrangeas that had never got a chance to bloom due to being browsed constantly , and this year I have lush roses blooming everywhere ! The original batteries are still working , too ( I discovered this accidentally by grabbing one by the red end , certain that the batteries must be dead by now . OW ! These do not burn , but the ache in my hand and wrist bones lasted until the next day . Needless to say : Keep the grandkids away from these ! ) I 'm back this year to order more to protect some blueberry bushes that are being decimated just as the berries are getting ripe .	1
When we first got the unit , we had to replace the batteries - the ones that it came with must have been old and they were not delivering a shock strong enough to do anything . It includes 3 units which says it covers 1200 square feet , but I think that 's stretching it . A lot depends on the landscaping of your yard and how the deer approach . We 've got woods close to ours and put 3 where the deer paths entered the yard . We did NOT have any problems with deer in the garden there , but they seemed to go around to the side of the yard and come in from that direction . It is rather expensive to line the periphery of a large , unfenced yard with multiple ways that deer can approach.Would probably be best used in conjunction with fencing to narrow wildlife approach . Check batteries often - every couple of weeks at least - with fresh strong batteries the shock is like a good electrostatic shock -it wo n't hurt the deer as much as startle them ( which is good and makes them run ) - but when the batteries get used up a bit , it does n't feel like much at all .	1
I was very excited to receive my Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent to use around my garden . This device uses an acorn scented extract to lure in the deer , then when they sniff the device they receive a shock . I know some people may be opposed to 'hurting ' a deer , but really , we use barbed wire fences on cows and electric fences for other livestock and the Havahart is no worse than any of these other fences ! My garden is n't in or growing yet , but I do have hundreds of perennials that the deer love to nibble on , the Havahart has made a big difference in my plant life already and I have great hopes for actually having a garden for myself this year instead of one for the deer.I love the fact that you can move the stakes around as you 'train ' the deer to stay away . The difficulty I had with this product was in the assemble , it was a bit difficult to snap the lower 2 pieces of the stake together , and the directions state that the product may be ruined if you put the batteries in the wrong way so you do need to be aware of that.All in all I think this is a great product , especially for someone like me who lives in the woods and has a lot of deer roaming around looking for a handout !	1
I set these up a few weeks ago . It is difficult to know just how successful they have been as I do n't know how much additional damage I would have gotten without them and I have never seen a deer touching a unit . I have had plants less than 10 feet away eaten , so these will be added to my normal arsenal of spraying and fencing but not counted on as the only solution . They would work best in a situation where the deer enter in one small area , like a driveway or gate . Unfortunately , my local deer have numerous paths and seem to be passing these by . I did touch the units to make sure they are working and to see how bad the shock is ( I have a puppy that I did not want harmed ) and the it is very mild - enough to scare , but not enough to cause any harm . I am glad these were n't around when I was a child or my big brother would have somehow gotten me to put my tongue on them , so watch out that your kids or neighbor kids do n't get that idea .	1
The concept sounds good , but one has to wait and see how this works in each individual case . You coat cotton balls with a deer attractant - and when a deer sticks its nose towards the balls they will get zapped by an electrical charge from two AA batteries . The negative side of this is that acorn scent has to be applied often ; if it rains then the scent is washed out . I put this in my back yard about a week ago , but I have not seen any deer passing nearby , I will wait longer to see its effect.1.Bird-X DG Deer Gard Ultrasonic Deer Repeller2.Havahart Deer Off DO32RTU Deer Rabbit and Squirrel Repellent 32 Ounce Ready-to-Use Spray	1
I got these to use around my garden , as I live in the country and we have frequent deer guests who love to munch on our corn seedlings , flowers and other garden plants . I placed the spikes as directed and put the lure liquid in as directed- the set up was easy . Just about anyone could set this up . After around 3 weeks , my plants are untouched by the deer . I saw one deer come up and then suddenly jump and take off , so I 'm sure that it was the shock from the Havahart that sent him packing . Hopefully , it will keep working.One big warning with this ( as stated on the packaging ) is that if a small child happens upon these spikes they will get a shock as well . My niece , when we were n't watching got a bit too close and got a shock that upset her . So , if you have small children that like to wander or play out in your garden , I might advise against putting this anywhere they could wander into it .	1
Although I have been unable to see the deer getting shocked by this device it does appear to be working . I have a severe deer problem with them nibbling on just about everything I plant . I placed these by the plants that they seemed to like the most and it appears to be keeping them away from those plants . I only wish there was some king of a `` counter '' on these stakes to register how many `` hits '' there might have been . Without any way of knowing for sure I am only speculating on whether they are working or possibly the deer just moved on of their own accord . The stakes were easy to assemble and although the instructions were very brief I think they were sufficient for such a simple device . Only a review by a deer could be more objective .	1
I 've been using Havahart products for many years , mostly theircage traps for small animals . They are the leader in humane animal control . Nonetheless , it is unrealistic to expect any such product to be 100 % effective , since we are dealing with a human-animal interface that involves an infinite number of possible behaviors and , therefore , outcomes . Havahart provides the most effective tools for those who do not wish to permanently harm the environment and wildlife . I have found this product to be just as effective as the cage traps I 've used in the past . In other words , if all goes well , the animal responds as hoped and the problem is eliminated . However , like people , animals ( especially wild animals ) are capable of learning quickly if they are hungry enough . I move these stakes fairly often to keep the deer on their toes , but now and then one figures it out and enjoys a meal . C'est la vie . Keep in mind that a combination of strategies might be in order . Perhaps a partial fence or panther urine . In any case , the Havahart Electronic Deer Repellent has greatly improved my odds of harvesting food from the garden . Along with common sense , this product is highly recommended .	1
Nozzle is very well made and has plenty of spray pattern options . Love the color choices ! Will be buying more .	1
This is a decent , cheap nozzle . It does n't leak and does not break easily . I bought the yellow so I could spot it in my yard easily . I did break the first one I had , but that was my fault . I was reeling it back in and the handle caught on a rock out of my line of sight . I kept reeling it in anyway , and yanking on the hose until the handle broke . I would say that under normal conditions , and even somewhat rough conditions this nozzle holds up well .	1
We have gone through several products similar to this and always ended up with something that broke , leaked or otherwise did n't function very well . We purchased several of these and put them on hoses throughout the yard . All of them have been working great . We have found needs for all 9 spray patterns .	1
I 've been frustrated with the hose nozzles I 've bought because they all seem to leak . This Dramm does NOT leak , so that makes it a five-star item in my book . Now we 'll see if it has the endurance to last an entire summer .	1
This is replacing an all-plastic multi-spray nozzle for me , and this product seems very solid . I like the many spray patterns .	1
I 'm very pleased with this nozzle . It has a wide variety of patterns to choose from , but more importantly it does n't leak . I ca n't stand it when nozzles leak . I liked this one so much I ordered another one for a different hose .	1
This is a good quality nozzle . I do n't use nearly all the spraying functions , but all 9 are unique so it 's not like you have only 2-3 real variations .	1
Great garden sprayer ! It features many spray patterns and has an extremely comfortable grip , the only fault I can find with it is that it feels as if its made out of a fairly cheap plastic . That really wasnt worth dinging it a star because it comes at such a low price and despite this , it works perfectly every time .	1
So many different patterns I have a tough time deciding what I want to use when I water my garden . I have had it for a few months now and nothing has gone wrong quite yet . I do disconnect it from the hose after each use . Great product I would definately get another down the road for a spare of if it breaks .	1
I 'll admit it . I was a sucker for the cool display and for those wild colors . And the truth is I really did n't need another hose nozzle because there are plenty of them lying around the house . After looking at these nozzles for weeks I finally scratched the itch , using an Ace discount coupon as my excuse.We 've only been together a few weeks , my nozzle and I , but the honeymoon is far from over . I like the looks of the DRAMM , the feel , and the performance . All of the spray patterns work well , and so far there has been none of the inevitable leaking from this fancy nozzle . The DRAMM replaces a recently bought Nelson ; I like the DRAMM more because of the additional spray patterns and the distance and spread achieved with the DRAMM.Even Mrs. Spudman , who could only roll her eyes when I came home with yet another nose nozzle , is smitten with the DRAMM also . She even gave me an unsolicited endorsement of my new garden toy , an unusual occurence for her . In fact , we both like our boldly colored DRAMM so much , I see a new DRAMM for us in the near future for our other hose.BUT - This beauty does have one flaw though . It can be tiresome to squeeze the handle for an extended period of time . This is why many nozzles have the little mechanism in the rear that keeps the handle from springing back to the closed position . On this nozzle the mechanism does n't work smoothly and for this user is more trouble than it 's worth . Thus four stars .	1
This nozzle is just great ! I have paired it with the & # 34 ; Pocket Hose & # 34 ; . ( You know , the one that expands ... ) . It works great ! I especially love the multiple settings like & # 34 ; Jet & # 34 ; ( shoots a hard solid stream - ideal for washing cars ) , & # 34 ; Shower & # 34 ; ( seems just right for watering plants ) and & # 34 ; Mist & # 34 ; ( perfect for delicate plants ) . It 's plastic but seems pretty durable so far .	1
About the only complaint I have with this nozzle is that the & # 34 ; shower & # 34 ; setting is not as good as the & # 34 ; shower & # 34 ; setting on my other nozzle . It is simply too spread out to use on specific small plants , even when I reduce the water flow using the handle .	1
For the price this spreader works fine for yards . It is a little small and requires frequent fillings though . Good pricing .	1
I needed a way to spread grass seed and living in a town home , have a small area that is available to grow grass . This spreader did the trick , it 's hand held and easy to use . My grass looks great .	1
I live in a town home with a very small grassy area . I 'm not supposed to have to maintain my lawn , but the landscapers do n't seem to care if they 're mowing crab grass or regular grass . I do , so I pulled out the crab grass and used this to spread the seed for new grass . I did n't have any problems with it jamming , and the seed spread evenly .	1
OI prefer to have control over where my fertilizer goes - so I like the hand spreader . My yard is about 10,000 sq feet - so not too difficult to fertilize by hand . Love Scott 's products !	1
This spreader is a great deal , much much cheaper than in the brick and mortar stores . It looses one star because from time to time it jams . But for the price I can forgive that and only deduct one star .	1
Works well I used it last Friday to put down some new lawn seed.. Then some simple old 10-10-10 fertilizer	1
This is so helpful with fertilizers in small spaces and Preen for flowerbeds . Easy to use , easy to figure out .	1
This is my twelfth season for using this tiller . To prepare my garden I use an ancient Troy built that has been going strong for about 18 years now ( I bought it used ) and it looks as if this Mantis two stroke is going to last just as long . To be honest , I am a rather lazy gardener and the job of all jobs I hate most is cultivating and weeding . This little machine has taken away almost all of the excuses I have for not having a neat , well tended garden . There are a couple of things you should know though before purchasing this little gem : First , this is not a machine that is suitable for breaking up new ground or ground that has not been tilled for several years . It simply is not built for that.Secondly , you should not let your mind wonder when using this cultivator . It can take out a garden plant in a flash if you loose control over it and indeed , if you are extremely inattentive , it certainly has the capability of taking off a toe or two.Thirdly : I would strongly recommend you use gloves when using this for any extended period of time . They give you protection of course , but they also allow for a better grip , ergo , more control.Forth : Try to avoid running in through bailing twine , wire or even vines if possible . Getting the stuff untangled is truly a odious task.Fifth : Perform the preventive maintenance on it as recommended and then double the timing on it . Keep the tines sharp and keep them replaced as needed . ( Yes , the tines are guaranteed against breakage , but I promise you that they will bend if bounced off enough rocks ... hey , I live in the Ozarks , rocks I know ! ) Sixth : Watch out for larger rocks . Not only can the bend tines , but they can cause the machine to go out of control.Seventh : Watch and take great care with your gas/oil mix and at the end of the season follow the directions as to winter storage.Now that being said , this thing is a snap to use . As a matter of fact it can easily be handled by a knowledgably and trained child with very little supervision . It can go into places a larger tiller can not possibly go . It is light and is very easy to maneuver once you get the hang of it . Now I admit that I am a complete and absolute klutz when it comes to fixing anything mechanical ( well , truth be told , non-mechanical things too ) , but I have had to take this into the shop only once in the years I have owned and used it . Everything else I was able to fix myself using only the manual provided , and over the past couple of years a few sites on my computer . No fancy tools are needed ; only the ability to read and a smudge of common sense . Hey , trust me , if I can do it , then just about anyone can . I mean we are talking here about someone so inept that my wife use to have to put the children 's Christmas toys together as I could not manage it.I am like another reviewer here . I doubt if I would still be gardening , vegetable and flowers , if I did not have this cultivator . If and when it finally goes belly up ( which will probably be long after I go first ) , I plan to purchase another . I do wish I could give this one more than five stars.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
I purchased this tiller from Amazon a few days ago . I watched the instruction DVD that came with the package . Starting the tiller for the first time seems so easy according to the DVD . Today I tried that . It was n't easy ! Here is my story starting it for the first time . ( 1 ) Use gloves . Your finger may get some blisters without it . ( 2 ) Go to hardware store and buy spark plug wrench . The spark plug was overly tightened at the factory . I used a rubber hammer to open it . ( 3 ) The problem that the engine did not start was because of wet spark plug . I had to clean it with a rag several times . ( 4 ) It did start for 3 seconds then stopped . Try again . ( 5 ) Then it started to 10 seconds then stopped . Pull it again . ( 6 ) It started for 1 minute then stopped . Keep trying . ( 7 ) Then it started for 2 minutes . I finally run the tines . Wow ! it was a powerful little machine.It may take a while on a hard or heavy soil like mine but it is capable to till such soil . It was doing a fine job on my garden.I have a cover crop planted on two 4 x 10 feet raised bed . I was thinking to rototill the cover crop . It did n't work . The plant was very long and stuck on the tine causing it not spinning . I have to take the tines apart to be able to reach the tangled plants in the middle.I gave it 4 starts because it was doing good job but difficult to start for the first time.Update 9/23/2012I used it to rototill 8x14 area yesterday . I was so surprised . It ran with 2 or 3 pull . It was doing a great job yesterday .	1
I have had a Mantis tiller since1990 and it was time to get a new one . The old one did not have a way to pump the fuel into the carborator and this one does . The main problem with this tiller is keeping the dirt out of the carborator . Every time you use this tiller I would remove the air filter and clean it and around the carborator . I use it in rocky soil and rocks do bind up the blades but you can easily remove the rocks . It will dig right through weeds and will dig deep to make a garden .	1
I had a Bolens that cost 200.00 & lasted ; one season , no fault of my own.MTD ( Bolens ) explained various reasons , but read the reviews ( Lowes ) and you will find 271 reviews citing the same stuttering pull cord starter and/or inoperable next season ( new carb kit is the 45.00fix ) but hard to pull ( recoils ) anyway.Got an electric Toro , like a blender in a sandbox ! Cord is a nusance.Took it back the next day . Finally decided to pony up my ante & choose between the Stihl Yard Boss & Mantis ; , plain old 2cyle tiller/cultivator.I chose the Mantis because my mother- in- law had one 30 years ago & I ; thought it worked fine , but too expensive.Turns out the Mantis can convert to a hedge trimmer ! And all the stuff the Stihl can convert to for about 100.00 less . ( I owm a Stihl weedeater & chain saw and they are great , probably the best ( all the previous , albeit cheaper tools are in-op or a back-up ) But the Mantis is everything.I live on a farm , put in raised beds , tried it out in the wetlands ( after weedwacking the ground to the bone ) it worked great ! Next & final test was to till hard ground that was barren weeds , to put in ground cover landscaping . THIS MANTIS TORE UP THE CLAY AND WEEDS LIKE IT WAS A REAR TILLER MACHINE ) Tines have a LIFETIME guarantee & the ; Mantis itself has a great warranty.It is so easy to pull start , tines convert from tiller to cultivator by reversing them , so you can go 3 inches or 8 inches deep in a minute ! ( pull the carter pin ) I am one happy gardener & landscaper.There ; really is nothing to compare for 300.00 !	1
This is really a rather odd little machine . I have had one for three years now and have had very few problems with mine . I grant you that it is a bit difficult to get started now and then but we usually get things worked out . If I keep it turned-up and keep fresh gas available and not let gas set in the tank too long or put old gas in , then I find I have fewer problems.This tiller does what I pay it to do which is cultivate between the rows of both vegetable and flowers . It is NOT built to completely till a garden . I am pretty happy with mine.I have a close friend who also has one of these . He likes his too.On the other hand , I have a friend who considers her Mantis be biggest hunk of junk she was ever talked into buying ( She is still a bit peeved at me I fear ) , and uses terrible language when talking about it . I have tried working with her particular machine ... I treat it like I treat mine but I have to tell you and tell you truthfully ... the one she has is indeed a `` bad egg . '' I am not sure if the people who make these things have quality control issues or what but there does seem to be a big lack of consistency here . I note , after reading all of the reviews here , there this is likely truer than I though . Some folks here are having a wretched time ; others love theirs . I can well believe both sides of the issue because I have observed this in real life when it comes to using this machine.Go figure ... ..	1
This rat zapper works good by killing small or larger mice and rats . Only thing is that you can not depend on the blinking light to let you know if there is a kill in it or not . First kill i got , no light was blinking . Then one night i go to check it and the light was blinking but nothing inside . So it 's best to pick it up and look inside , that way you know for sure if you got a kill or not .	1
Shortly after moving into our farm house in the woods , I noticed a lot of mouse in the house . I placed this in a corner with a piece of bread and cheese in it and within a few minutes , I had a dead mouse inside . A year later it still works great . During the fall season , they come running into my house looking for a warm place . This zipper kills them daily . I am very pleased .	1
Worth noting : I have the `` older '' model - the silver one.I initially tried to use this when temps were 30 degrees and below and it just does n't work . I have changed the batteries this spring and have already caught two pests in one week - a mouse and a chipmunk . We have chipmunks and I 'm starting to see new holes in the yard . I initially struggled using this product since I am an animal lover , but my yard is getting wrecked and I 'm tired of having all my hard work get destroyed . I also also tired of large amounts of poop in my garage , all over my shelving.This unit is very easy to use - though I really wish the back had an opening . I 'm always so paranoid to stick my hand in there to load the bait , even with the item turned off . I take out a battery when I load the bait , just to be sure I do n't get zapped . LOL A `` back door '' that opened for easy bait loading would be much appreciated ! I 'm using peanut butter as bait.I do like that this kills the pest quickly , humanely and cleanly . There 's no blood , etc . Just tip the device into a yard waste bag and load bat again . I was doing the catch and release method with Havahart , but got tired of giving chipmunks a ride to the local park , wasting gas and time.For the money , I 'm happy ! Easy to use , easy to set and works well . Love the blinking red light telling you you 've got a catch ! Update 06/19/2011 : we 're catching one chipmunk a day now ! I ca n't believe how well this works . Current chippy count : 5 .	1
We get citrus rats on occasion . They come because some neighbors refuse to clean up their fallen fruit . I can honestly say , there a couple less happy rats in our area . This unit needs to be checked often for batteries , but , other than that , it works . Ask any dead rats you may know .	1
This rat zapper is awesome ! I live in the city so of course there are going to be rats ! They are so big the damn cats in the neighborhood wo n't do anything about it . I noticed a rat in my trash can , so that is when I bought the ultra rat zapper . I have probably killed 15 rats . I use dry dog food and sometimes I will put a little bit of peanut butter on a small piece of paper towel and put it inside the trap .	1
I had a rat in my basement which was chewing up wiring , tear out insulation , and leaving large droppings around . We had been storing food stuff like extra ketchup bottles and boxes of cereal on a shelf in the basement when we found them chewed into and ruined by a rat several months ago . I tried several different types of rat traps at first with no luck . It would eat the bait off the trip lever or ignore the trap altogether . I put a piece of dog food in the rat zapper and a couple of pieces on the outside of it and placed it in an area I though the rat frequented because of the insulation and droppings in that area . It sat there for a couple of weeks with nothing happening . Then one day I saw the red eyes alternately blinking on the optional tale tell remote alert accessory for this trap and bingo ! I looked up on the foundation wall where I had placed the rat zapper and yes , there was a very long tail hanging out of it ! ! ! I took several pictures of it and added them to the item pictures on this product page.This trap is a lot more expensive than basic traps , but I love the fact that all I had to do was dump the dead rat out without any mess or smell what so ever . I put some new dog food in and around the trap and put it back where I had it before . It was that simple . I can see that this was indeed a large rat ! I consider the money well spent . I do n't have to worry about the damage to our house and wasted food anymore ! I would highly recommend this product to anyone with rat problems ! Thanks Rat Zapper !	1
Be patient and try cheddar cheese . Our story : I kinda felt bad about killing the little buggers , but they had been eating our tomatoes and pestering our pets . THEY HAD TO GO . Being the soft-hearted person I am , I felt mechanical traps had the potential of being cruel , as did rat poisons ( never mind the smell of decaying rat bodies ) , and we do n't have a pet store who would take trapped rats as snake food because they were wild . It took over a week for the first kill . We were watching and saw the rat enter the trap . He/she simply died . No death throes . No sparks . No smoke . Just sudden , instantaneous death . The rat 's tail did n't even so much as twitch . If you have problems getting your rats to go inside , you must be patient . Ours went after cheddar cheese chunks -- not peanut butter , not bananas , not tomatoes , not dog food , not chicken , not sunflower seeds , not even oatmeal . Try to touch the bait as little as possible . Try setting a big chunk in the very back of the chamber and a smaller one just in front of the zapper pad . Then just walk away . Just walk away . Leave it alone . Do n't move it , do n't touch it , do n't breathe on it . The red light will flash when you need to check it . Although I still feel bad about killing the little critters , I have no doubt that they did n't even know what hit them .	1
It took 3 weeks to catch anything . I tried different baits , etc. , until one particular type of dog food worked . I 'm still experimenting , and will post back when I find out what works best for me . I was all set to return this , because I thought it did not work . The green light stays lit for only a couple of seconds and then shuts off , but the unit is LIVE so be careful . I have caught three mice in my attic in the last week and I think that it is the different `` bait '' that I am placing into the unit . D batteries make this heavy , which is good . I ca n't tell you how nice it is to see the red blinking light ! And then when you see the little vermin laying there so peacefully ... .well , the first time I was afraid the little critter was just sleeping . It 's a big difference than using the other old-fashioned traps . It certainly seems more humane . The only problem I can see is trying to clean the inside ( if you tried to use peanut butter , or something similar ) . This is pretty close to five stars , and as long as it has some longevity to it , I am very pleased . It is easily portable and you do n't have to worry about something wacking your fingers ! This should certainly not be placed where a child can get to it or throw something into it ( I do n't know what would happen , and will not try it , but I do n't think it would be good ) . I would keep it away from any place that can get wet as well . Use nitrile ( or latex ) gloves when handling/baiting the unit to keep your scent off of it . Also , keep it away from where a pet can get to it ! I suspect a ferret or cat may not do too well trying to get the bait . If you do n't get something after trying different baits , try moving the unit to another location . I also rubbed the bait on the front of the unit to try to give it more `` scent . ''	1
It was one thing when the desert rodents were eating the plants I just bought from the nursery ( See my review for the Havaheart ) . I figured , we 'll just live with it , find some plants they do n't like to eat , and keep catching and releasing miles away . It was quite another thing when they moved in to the F-150 and the station wagon . Woodrats lose all vestiges of cuteness when you find a pile of twigs and poop on top of your engine . So far , luckily , no chewed up wires.This product works . For us , it does n't even need bait . We just set it out and flip the switch . One time it only took 15 minutes to catch a ground squirrel.We freeze the bodies for my brother 's boa constrictor . She 's better fed now than she has been in a long time . And we also intentionally invite coyotes and bobcats to come for a free snack out in the middle of the driveway . ( I 'd much rather have them hunt my ground squirrel problem away . ) We 've caught mice , woodrats and several antelope ground squirrels . The kangaroo rats and lizards are n't interested in it . Now , if I could just get that long-tailed `` city '' squirrel that 's not native -- maybe if I bait it with some KFC .	1
**Update** January 2011 : We 've owned this Rat Zapper Ultra for 2.5 years and it still works great . It 's zapped about 3 dozen mice using 2 sets of batteries . I 've cleaned it once per the manufacturer 's directions ( it had dried mouse pee in it , yuck ) . Thought this update would be helpful to those of you wondering about the longevity of the Zapper Ultra ... we 're very happy with it . **Original review**Our house was new when we moved in but it had sat on the market for a year , empty . This apparently gave mice ample opportunity to move in and they chose the area under the jet tub in the master bathroom as their home . We can access that area by the little cabinet doors under the tub , and that 's how I discovered the rodent poo scattered all over.I did n't want my husband to have to deal with the rodents ... I wanted to take care of the problem myself . So , traditional traps were out of the question , I knew I would n't be able to deal with the sight of a dead mouse in a trap . We have a dog , so poisons were out of the question , plus I did n't want a mouse crawling off to die and rot somewhere in my house . I did n't want a cat , because with my luck it 'd be the Garfield of all cats.. I think there are also sticky traps that trap the mouse and let you release it while it 's alive , but I did n't think I could handle that either , a frantic mouse having to be carried outside , only to have it return later to our bathroom.I ended up buying the Rat Zapper Ultra online directly from the maker . At the time , I did n't know what kind of rodent we had so I got the Ultra , just in case they were giant rats or squirrels . For mice it 's probably overkill , but I 'm fine with that.It arrived within the week , and I did n't tell my husband how much I paid for it because if it did n't work to catch the rodents , my husband would give me the stink-eye for paying more than $ 5 for a mouse-trap . I set it up that night under the tub , putting a piece of the included dog food in the trap and turning it on . ( It was safe from the dog because it was behind cabinet doors that my dog ca n't open . ) I got the first mouse around 8pm , only a couple hours after I set up the Rat Zapper . I turned it off , picked up the trap and carried it outside to the woods around our house , and slid the mouse ( and piece of dog food ... . I did n't reuse it ! ) out onto the ground . I did n't have to look at the little dude , a bonus of using this trap , but I did look because I wanted to see what kind of rodent it was . It was a little mouse.This was repeated the next two nights . Around 8pm , I 'd catch a mouse in the Rat Zapper . A total of 3 mice , and no more . The mice were gone , baby , gone . I keep the Zapper in that cabinet , turned on , just in case a new mouse family moves in.So , I was very happy and far too proud of myself for dealing with the mice without my husband 's help . He was happy that the $ 50 mousetrap worked so well and so quickly , and that pest control was now a chore that his darling wife ( me ! ) could handle.Highly recommend the Rat Zapper Ultra , especially if you happen to be squeamish about other rodent-trapping methods . Even if you 're not squeamish , it was a very effective way of getting rid of rodents , there was no way they were getting out of that trap with the piece of dog food .	1
I knew I had something in my attic , but did n't know if it was a rat or a mouse , and whatever it was was very good at stealing peanut butter from the traditional spring traps I was using . Despite the high price , I bought The Rat Zapper because it was the only product I could find here that said it worked for rats AND mice ( and squirrels too ) . All other traps seemed to be designed for one or the other , and I was n't sure what I had.I read the very thorough and useful instructions that came with it , and used dry dog food for bait ( it even came with a small bag of dog food ) . I was a bit disappointed after not catching anything for two weeks , but two weeks after setting it I caught a huge rat . I believe it took so long because I did n't fully follow the instructions and put it in the middle of my attic instead of against a wall . Also , rats are much more clever than mice and you have to just leave the Zapper up there for awhile and not touch it so they become used to it.I have since caught 3 more rats and catch one about every two weeks . The first catch had a very small bit of blood , but since then I just empty the Zapper into a plastic bag and reset it . No mess and no hassle of having to drive 5 miles away and set a rat free . I have been using it for 6 weeks and have n't had to change the batteries yet.I strongly recommend that anyone who plans to use this in an attic or out of the way area purchaseThe Rat Taleto go with it . It is a small device with a very long cord that plugs into the zapper and flashes whenever the Zapper has caught something . I hang mine below my attic and that way I do n't have to check the Zapper every day because it will let me know when I 've caught something .	1
One of our barns had become home to a rat , the evidence was in the droppings I would find . This was especially worrying as it appeared to have used the insulation I put in our well house room as its home . Droppings had fallen on top of the water softener tank . Had I not noticed them they could easily have fallen in to the brine tank when I topped up the salt pellets . That could have introduced potentially hazardous water to our family home.I set the trap about 6 weeks ago and had no success . The user manual suggested I used dried nuts as bait.Last week the wife made a delicious peach pie using fruit from this years peach harvest . I decided to take a small piece of the pie crust with a little peach filling on it and replace the nuts with it.The very next day my unwelcome guest met his demise.I had placed the trap up high in the barn , on one of the main beams that runs the length of one of the walls . I 'd seen the furry squatter use this beam as a way to traverse the barn out of harms reach . Checking the trap at night with the barn lights off means the flashing `` rat zapped '' light reflects on the roof of the barn and saved me having to disturb it.It definitely does its job . The only thing I can add is to chose your bait wisely . Some items obviously work better than others.The kill is quick , clean , and humane . The rat will not die slowly from poisoning , or in agony with a limb trapped in a manual trap.The potential for introducing disease in to my families home , gnawing on electrical cables in the barn , and other acts of damage , meant we had to get rid of this little guy . Trapping and releasing him was not an option , he would just breed and add to the population . A quick kill solved the problem.The zapper is back in place right now , ready for the next unwelcome guest .	1
I first discovered this product last summer when some of my plants were attacked by an unknown bug that made holes in all the foliage . So I purchased this and it did the trick , the plants it hit the worst I cut to the ground and poured this mixture diluted on the entire area . The plants re-emerged and were not bothered the rest of the season . Also kept caterpillars off my Hibiscus and my echinacea and many others . Highly recommend .	1
Spinosad is really quite revolutionary ( I suggest doing a wikipedia search , so you know EXACTLY what you are getting ) .It is completely harmless to pets , children , and plants . Unlike many pesticides you can spray this heavily on leaves and roots with zero negative effects . It works wonders on most insects.One note of caution : after being mixed with water it is only effective for 24 hours , so only mix as much as you will need per application . Anything left over will be waste . This bottle is a concentrate that will last you a very , very , very long time.Even kept in a dark , cool environment the concentrate in this bottle will only last 2 years , so you may want to get a slightly smaller quantity , but it was a perfect amount for me as I have a food forest and permaculture garden ,	1
When the garden shows signs of leaves being eaten , or other pest evidence , a shot of this does the job to get rid of them .	1
Spinosad ( pronounced spin-OH-sid ) is a somewhat new organic spray out on the market , brewed from , of all things , a soil bacteria found underneath an abandoned rum distillery in the Caribbean.Spinosad is extremely effective , yet it 's only mildly toxic to humans and birds . I use it to get rid of thrips primarily , but it kills leafminers and spider mites too . It also kills caterpillars for about a month after spraying , so if you 're trying to attract butterflies to your garden , do n't use this around any plants that caterpillars like to eat.Spray early in the morning before bees come out , as spinosad spray is toxic to honeybees while wet .	1
This product just plain WORKS -- I have fought leaf miners for several years in my tomatoes , basil and some of the flowers , this year I tried this product . My problem is down at least 90 % only the petunias are not responding as well as other plants , but still problem is down at about 75 % . It also has rid me of spider mites and aphids , so i do n't have to spray for them on the roses . I even have had great luck using it on roses when mixed with Bonide FungOnil , putting recommended amount of BOTH in my sprayer and completing two tasks at same time . I highly recommend Monterey 's Sipnosad .	1
Sourced from a bacterium ( S. Spinosa ) , spinosad is a great pesticide used for a wide variety of pests . It is considered organic and approved for organic use . It is considered to be highly safe for human use . Supposedly it also shows low or no toxicity to honeybees in studies , but I wo n't use it on any of my plants while they are flowering , just to be safe.I generally reapply it every few weeks .	1
I finally managed to get rid of the ants that were living in my garden for the past 3 yrs . Ants kept taking residence in my garden and since I stick with organic practices , I did n't have many options . Tried growing things that the ants did n't like and boiling water . They just kept coming back . This insect spray is OMRI listed , so I filled a sprayer and sprayed the ant hills and drenched the soil in that portion of the garden . Its been several weeks now and no more ants.Just be careful how you apply this stuff . It can be harmful to beneficial insects as well ( ladybugs , bees , etc . ) .	1
My only problem was being consistent with follow-up sprays . This stuff really works ! I use it in my greenhouse and this container still has about a quarter of a bottle left with no more signs of thrips . My plants recovered and started bearing again . Good stuff !	1
Ca n't beat the price and still get a decent metal rake . Tried a cheaper plastic one from the local Lowes and it was trash . This is much better and only a couple dollars more . Shipped to me in a HUGE box , but well packed in . Hopefully the person packing yours has access to a smaller box though . Seriously , two bodies would have fit in the box this thing shipped in .	1
I wo n't lie , I have never used the rake , but my husband absolutely loves it and says its the best rake he 's ever used . It is so easily adjustable to either have a tight small fan or wide fan area and is of sturdy good quality . Would buy again .	1
I hide this rake in my greenhouse so no one else in my house takes it and I always know where it is . It 's the only one I want to use . I love this rake . I can use it for whatever raking job I need to do because I can change the size of the rake head so quickly . Plus this is n't expensive !	1
This thing is amazing ! Made of steel , very durable and incredibly versatile . It opens as wide as 22 inches for when raking leaves on your lawn , drive-way , etc . and the best , which was freaking great , it closes to 7 inches , which helped a GREAT deal when raking leaves from the street curb.This rake is light , manageable and very easy to use . I did n't experience is strain or felt tired while using it . A great tool that I promise you wo n't regret buying . I loved it so much , I gave one to a co-worker and my in-laws . Trust me , you wo n't need another rake again .	1
Love the collapsable feature on this rake and that you can get any size needed for the job . Sometimes , the prongs of the rake get bent weirdly and you have to struggle a bit to close the rake , but otherwise has been great . Even at its largest setting it is n't super big so if you have a big job on your hands you may want to get a different rake , but for most people I 'm sure it 'll be just fine !	1
A few years ago I had gone to Pennsylvania for a garden show and purchased this rake . We love it so much , my husband and I fight over it . So , I bought another one . You think that would have done it . No ... .now my daughter-in-law wants one . It 's the best rake ever .	1
Was a good buy . Perfect for the use I needed it for . Love being able to adjust it , great for using around flower beds , fences , etc . Was stronger than I expected , which is good . Metal tines have held up nicely , but do tend to get clogged with leaves very quickly . It is strong enough and sharp enough it can actually do some minor dethatching . If you have a medium to large yard with lots of leaves , get something larger .	1
Love the adjust-ability but it was kind of stuck when I first tried it and I actually had to old the rake in my hand and use my feet to give it a push to unstick it - after that it adjusted just fine and on the fly which is very very handy . I 'd never hear of an adjustable rake but when checking Amazon this came up high in the search and I chose it after a quick comparison of a few models and am glad I did , this is so much better than a regular rake , it is several rakes on one . I just wonder if the plastic lever lock will last so one star reduced for the plastic .	1
This year my mom had graciously planted sunflowers for me in the garden . The plan was to cut them a day after they bloomed . However , the deer were faster ! They first ate the sunflowers when they were first sprouting , and then again when the flowers appeared and opened up.Although I appreciate the deers ' plight and of humans destroying their habitat , I also did n't want to lose any more sunflowers . Thus , I used the Deer Off -- this product works ! The curious thing about the product is the label though . The active `` natural '' red pepper ingredients that are listed only make up about 4 % of the concentrate . What are the remaining 95 % ? The company does n't seem to want to share that information on its labels . I will say that my dog ignores the part of the yard where the sunflowers are growing and the areas that 's been sprayed . I have kind of been reluctant to take him there anyway ( despite the fact that Deer Off is supposed to be safe for pets , I 'd rather not risk it ) .As of about three weeks , I have n't seen any more deer and the sunflowers live . Instead of cutting them though , I 've let them bloom . Maybe the deer will come back for them , but it seems like they are being repelled by the Deer Off .	1
This spray , mixed as directed , will keep squirrels away for at least 30 days even with rain ( but the area dry when sprayed ) . There are no deer or rabbits in my area but with neighbors feeding squirrels they are over-populating this small neighborhood . Squirrels dig up plantings all around my home and `` plant '' their peanuts in my garden pots . They also run along the top of the fence , teasing my dog , jump onto the roof where they shell the peanuts leaving the hulls in the gutters . By spraying the top of my wood fences the squirrels stay off of them , and do n't get to the roof . I even spray the fence in the winter when it is fairly dry and it seems to continue working . I want to try spraying it on landscaped areas where I would prefer my dog stay out . If that works , I 'll be back in a month with an update . This is a product I will definitely continue using ! !	1
Our biggest problems are a plague of rabbits , and the occasional deer.In the past , the Deer Off sprayer has worked well for me , so I was looking forward to trying out their concentrate . So far , I 'm happy to note that it seems to be doing something right - our previously inflicted damage has not worsened.However , as this is a product whose effectiveness can only be gauged over an extended period of time , I 'll have to watch to see how it progresses .	1
This review is for Deer Off 32 oz Deer-Rabbit-Squirrel Repellent Concentrate . This product worked for me . I used a quarter of the bottle , mixed with almost 56 oz of water and applied to all my shrubs . I did this four times until the bottle was done . The deer stayed away . I 'll update if they stop by and start eating the shrubs again . The product is fairly easy to use . Shake well , dilute , and spray or water using a can.The bottle contains 32 oz of concentrate . The dilution ratio is 1 part concentrate to 7 parts water . So you can mix only 4 oz of concentrate with 28 oz of water if you prefer to test . The concentrate has a strong smell and contains egg solids and a mix of other ingredients . Shake well . Some sprayers may clog due to the consistency of the mix . Use a watering can as a last resort . You do n't want to over-dilute to make it thinner.I want to reiterate that this is not meant for plants grown for human consumption , even though the ingredients are natural . Do n't even let the spray drift near your garden . It can be used on shrubs , small trees , and bulbs/flowering plants that are usually eaten by the animals . For me , it was the tall shrubs that the deer would eat , eating the bottom half , and the top half would remain untouched since it was too high . So the shrubs look terrible . I applied this to my shrubs and it worked . The deer did n't touch my shrubs . It 's been a rainy season and I 've had to apply this nearly every two weeks . Maybe that 's why it worked so well.Certain animals in certain locations have different tolerances to the scents and strengths of the product . Consider diluting less if it does n't work the first time to see if that makes a difference .	1
I was a little skeptical about this product . I 've used so many products to try and keep the rapacious squirrels away from my urban container garden , but nothing seems to work , at least long term . I 've tried water spray motion detectors and fox urine , etc . but the squirrels continue to dig up or eat everything -- strawberries , tomatoes , flower bulbs.I followed the directions , diluting this liquid into a spray bottle with water and dowsing the plants that get attacked . The sprayer did get clogged so that eventually I was sort of plopping dribbles on the plants , and there is some discoloration on the leaves , but despite heavy rains the past couple of weeks , there still has n't been a squirrel sighting , and I used to see them every time I looked out on the deck -- they were out there more than I was ! So I have to say that so far it 's going well , and I 'll update this review if necessary.Oh , and there are definitely no deer showing up on our third floor balcony either ; - )	1
I have used Deer Off before . Like most repellents of this sort , the product relies on rotten egg and capsaicin to deter deer . It also has garlic in it.My experience with the product has been very good . I prefer to buy the concentrate versus ready-made as all deer repellents tend to be expensive . It is usually cheaper to buy Deer Off concentrate than ready-to-use mixtures , but keep an eye out for sales . On occasion it is better to buy their 64 ounce ready-made , and some containers feature a battery powered sprayer.I do switch brands from season to season . Here 's why : if everyone in your neighborhood goes to the same large store or even local hardware store , they tend to buy the same spray . This means every shrub in every yard is treated with the same product.The deer eventually are going to eat something , and when they run out of untreated food , or are simply hungry enough , they are going to eat treated vegetation . So if they wander into 5 yards and 4 smell identical , they tend to avoid the 5th yard a little longer . I know this is not a scientific approach , but it is simple and has held true for me for the most part.Of course during a harsh , cold season , deer will eat even things they rarely touch , sprayed or not.So I rotate between Deer Off and another product , as well as my homemade recipe . The homemade spray is simply a gallon of water poured into a plastic milk jug , to which I add one raw egg , some hot sauce or powder , some garlic , a teaspoon or two of cinnamon , and a couple of squirts of liquid dish detergent . I close the gallon container and put it out in the heat/sun to rot . It smells bad , but so do most of these products . For a fraction of what commercial sprays cost , I have an effective homemade ( inexpensive ) spray . Every time I use some of the jug I read water and another egg . Every few uses I add some more of the other ingredients.The main ingredients are similar to a commercial product . I add cinnamon as it cloaks some of the bad odor with a sweet smell as you walk past the plants , without making them taste/smell better to deer . The dish detergent helps the spray adhere to plants but wo n't hurt the plant . Keep in mind your dog may lick some of it up because of the egg.The main difference between homemade spray ( aside from cost ) is you have to respray it more frequently ( after any heavy rain and most showers ) .As far as Deer Off , I like it , it typically works for me . I shook it up before mixing , etc . and while I did not notice any usual thickness , my sprayer also clogged ( I see a few reviews about that ) . I have a battery powered sprayer ( originally from a Deer Off spray ) . I flushed it with water and it was OK so I do n't know if it was a fluke . I have reused it since with this product and its been fine.I like this product as one of the 2 or 3 commercial brands I use , and have found it to be the most effective ( and also the strongest smelling ) .	1
I live in New York City , so I do n't have a deer or rabbit problem , but we do have plenty of squirrels . They love to steal from my parents ' fig tree . Since they started using this , I 've heard no complaints about squirrels . I like that this is made of putrescent egg yolks and not dangerous chemicals . It 's humane and safer for humans and pesky animals alike .	1
I used Deer Off last season and it did a great job keeping the deer away from my chestnut trees . The deer do n't even hang around in the chestnut tree part of the yard anymore . In my experience , the Deer Off does not deter my squirrels , and , without hesitation , they scamper up the tree trunks to get the chestnuts . Rabbits are not an issue for me , so I can not comment on how the spray is a deterrent for rabbits . Dogs are not affected at all.We have a regular deer herd that hangs out on our property ( about 5-6 deer ) . They have been hard on my chestnut trees and , while , I want to be kind to nature , I really do n't want them eating my trees or rubbing on the tree trunks . I used Deer Off last year & it was a winning product . I will continue using the product this year & expect the same results.Deer Off is advertised as safe for use with kids & pets . My dogs have been in & around the sprayed trees & have exhibited no adverse reaction at all . They can tell there is some sort of a scent , so they sniff the trees.This product is great . My previous bottle had a battery operated sprayer , which was nice . I used this bottle as a refill for that sprayer .	1
This repellent is easy to use . It is concentrated and you just mix with water and spray onto the plants you want to protect . ( The 32 ounce bottle will make 2 gallons of repellent . ) I have used other animal repellents in the past that just smell awful . This one did not smell too bad . ( at least not as bad as the other ones I tried ) .I applied it to some of my susceptible plants and so far it seems to be protecting them.I like that the formulation is safe to use around pets and children . I try to avoid anything toxic in my garden and this product is approved for organic gardening .	1
Deer Off is a natural repellent made from egg , cayenne pepper , and garlic . This is the concentrated version , so you need to dilute it and use a sprayer for it . I have been using an older sprayer that came with a previous Deer Off product I received : B001H1GQ8GI have a small straw garden this year , and the area where the squirrels like to play is only a few feet away . I spray around the straw bales every so often and have not had any squirrels or rabbits try to steal my tomatoes or herbs . I have left food for the squirrels in their area . They eat it there and do not bother to come near the garden . Deer have been staying far away as well . I also have two Earthboxes with vegetables , and they have not been touched at all after spaying this around them . Please note that I spray around my food plants and not directly on them . While this is a natural product , I do n't think that it is necessary or a good idea to spray this directly on food producing plants . The odor from this product is meant to repel plant eating animals , but it is not really noticeable to people . I only noticed a faint pepper scent from the bottle.I really like this because it works without causing any harm to critters , lawns , or plants . It 's okay for dogs to play in the yard while you spray it . It is n't messy at all , either . I have made my own natural repellent sprays before , but they were a hassle and did n't work as well as this does .	1
This `` Deer Off '' deer , rabbit , and squirrel repellent works well to keep squirrels away from my shed . We do n't keep much of a garden and do n't mind the deer that come into our yard , but have a fairly serious issue with squirrels getting into my shed and eating our plastic gas cans ( seriously annoying ) .This is a natural and non-toxic ( to the animals ) way to deter the critters without hurting them . We apply this around the outside and on the roof after each rain and it has kept our squirrel damage way down.Recommended ! CFH	1
I took this to a retirement home where a resident has had deer eat all the roses and lots of other plants including ones that normally do n't attract deer . These deer are n't shy like city deer - they come to feed at all hours.After spraying the garden with this stinky Deer Off , no more problems occurred . The hungry deer are still around , they just do n't eat the sprayed plants . It works .	1
We are rural with quarter acres vegetable plots so deer are a big problem . We have five feet of electical fencingParmak Super Energizer 5 Low Impedance 110/120 Volt 50 Mile Range Electric Fence Controller SE5running around our garden but our neighbor 's garden does n't have a fence and his beans were getting hit hard by the deer.Because you ca n't spray it on food , my brother dumped the entire container of Deer Off in a bucket ( said it looks and smells like chicken wing sauce made with butter and hot sauce ) added a little water , and soaked rope in it . He then strung the rope around the garden . Voila - no more deer.He just ran the rope this week and it rains daily so I do n't know how long it will last . I 'll add an addendum.Dinged the product a star because of the price but will give it back if it really does last 90 days .	1
Followed the simple instructions for application and applied this to my fruit bearing bushes , herb garden , vegetable garden , and flower beds . My problem is rabbits and an occassional deer . So far , i have not spotted any offenders in the treated areas.Since I only applied this a few days ago , i can not attest to its effectiveness over a three month period . However , I am pleased with its performance and ease of application . It is doing a good job when it comes to keeping my growing rabbit population at bay .	1
We live in newer housing development that does n't have fencing so the rabbits can easily so wherever they want . We have several fruit trees that seem to attract the rabbits and they leave their beans all over the place . They also like to bite at the bottom of the tree for some reason . I like rabbits but I wish they would n't leave their beans in the yard because one of our goofy dogs will try to eat it . That being said I like having a way to keep the rabbits away without harming them in any way . I ca n't say how this product works to repel deer or squirrels but it works very well at keeping the rabbits away . I have used this product before but it come in a large bottle with a battery operated spray nozzle . The nozzle was a total pain because it did n't want to start spraying and kept getting clogged because the repellent is slightly thick . This bottle is concentrated so you do n't need to use very much at all . I used it to build a barrier around my fruit trees and a barrier around the outline of my yard . I just fill up the applicator cup and walk along pouring a very thin line of the repellent . It does n't last super long but I would say it normally lasts 4 to 6 weeks with no signs of any rabbits .	1
Deer Off makes a great product . While using Deer Off , my garden has not been terrorized by rabbits . This is an economical solution and all it requires is a spray pump and some water . A 32 oz bottle will yield you 2 gallons and enough to treat 4000 sq feet according to the manufacture.It dries odorless and is safe to use around pets and children . My dog is never bothered by it , and still pees on the bushes . But at least the flowers have n't been eaten by rabbits.It 's a great product , I recommend it .	1
If deer are hungry , they will eat just about anything , maybe even including foliage treated with this spray ; however , this product is a great way to encourage them to browse elsewhere . I mix up a batch , spray it on and around the plants I know they like to eat , and it keeps them away . Even better , I 've found that a couple of applications will discourage them enough not to try that plant again for months , even if it rains or snows in between . They learn their lesson fairly quickly after smelling the rotten egg and tasting the hot pepper . Of course , new deer in the yard have n't learned that , which makes it necessary to apply Deer Off at least three or four times a year , even once the deer start to avoid a plant or area.The only disadvantage to this product is the cost . I make up a home brew that is as effective but a lot messier and smellier , and I apply that in between Deer Off purchases ( although , in this case , I got the concentrate from Amazon Vine , not a retail store . ) Even mixing this from concentrate is easier than blending a batch in my kitchen . Still , I find it helps to mix up the distasteful smells/taste , even though the ingredients are roughly the same.Because I live in a high deer-concentration area , this product has saved a lot of my landscape . The deer do n't like it unless they are truly desperate. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
I do like Deer Off and have used it before . It works very well , but the Deer off with a motorized sprayer was useless as I could n't get it to work . The one I had was a dud . I 'd suggest that if you do need this product ( and I do ) that you invest in a reliableSolo 420 2-Liter One-Hand Pressure Sprayerto have on hand when you decide to spray . A measuring cup comes with this concentrate , something that is quite handy . I have critters galore around my property and have long since given up on having things like daffodils or tulips because `` someone '' seems to be right behind me digging them up for a snack.If you do want to plant bulbs this fall , you can simply dip them in the concentrate for five minutes and set them aside to dry . I have n't tried this yet as I 'll be planting in the fall , but am very pleased with this idea . This is a concentrate so I 'll be getting a lot of use out of it . It will cover roughly 4,000 square feet if I so choose to spray that much . The only cautionary note concerning the concentrate itself was that you do n't over-dilute the product . The other was to avoid spraying directly on plants for human consumption.ACTIVE INGREDIENTS : ~ Putrescent Whole Egg Solids - 6.25 % ~ Capsaicin and related Capsaicinoids - 0.0045 % ~ Garlic - 0.005 % The `` Deer Off '' itself does work and there are several positive things to think about.PROS : ++ You can safely use it around children and pets , but take note that you will want to keep it out of reach as you would any product . Think pepper here.++ It has USDA approval to use in organic gardens.++ I could not smell any heavy odor , but it is offensive to those critters you do n't want chomping on your plants.++ Deer Off will repel deer , squirrels , and rabbits.++ This is a weather-resistant formula . The other Havahart Deer Off in the spray bottle had to be reapplied after a heavy rain.++ You can soak your flower bulbs in this solution to prevent critters from digging them up and eating them.++ Lasts for up to three months.CONS : -- You can not use this `` on plants intended for human consumption '' as it contains egg solids . Care must be taken to keep the Deer Off from drifting onto these plants if you are spraying. -- The critters may head for your neighbor 's gardens ( this can be either a pro or a con , depending on how you perceive it ) .I was conflicted in applying a star rating for this product when I had the sprayer , but I have no problem giving the Deer Off concentrate five stars . If you have critter problems in your gardens or with your trees , this is definitely a must have product . It wo n't hurt them , but will simply deter them from stripping off your tree bark , pulling up your flower bulbs , eating your garden , and annoying the heck out of you .	1
I 've used this product and products like this ( liquid fence ) before with varied results.Basically it 's incredibly strong smelling stuff ( and believe me you will smell this when mixing from concentrate and also when applying ) . If you 're spraying it , you probably want it to be on a relatively calm day , and have everyone go inside for a bit . It 's not so bad , but it is pretty smell stuff , and just not nice to smell . The good news is that smell is also what is supposed to keep the deer and other critters away.I 've found that this sometimes works , and I think it really depends on if your garden/shrubs/etc are the only choice for a meal or not . If there are other options I think they just usually move on . The product claims 90 days , but I 've never had luck for that long , especially when it rains , which seem to reduce the effectiveness greatly.This specific product is great because it makes 2 gallons of the stuff , and to buy that directly would be a pain to store and quite a bit more expensive . Might want to try a small spray bottle first to see if it works , and if it does go up to this .	1
I used to enjoy landscaping around our house , which is in an `` ex-urban '' area ( not quite rural , but heavily wooded , and definitely more wild than a typical suburban setting ) . As our deer population increased dramatically over the past 15 years , I gradually gave up on landscaping , because the deer ate all of my plants down to ground level . It was really discouraging.I tried various deer repellents , with limited success . Part of the problem is the density of our deer population . The deer graze their way through the yard every night , and a couple of times during daylight hours . There are usually 3-4 grazing at once , but sometimes larger groups come through ( the largest was a herd of over 40 deer ) .Two years ago , the owner of a nearby nursery recommended Deer Off . He uses it to protect the nursery plants , and he said it was the only thing he 'd found that worked . Although the product is pretty expensive , I decided to give it a try . I was amazed by the results . Plants that had previously been eaten down to nothing now look great . The deer do n't even nibble on them.Based on the suggestion of the nursery owner , I really cover the leaves when applying . For a few days , this leaves an unattractive residue on the plant leaves , but it fades quickly even though the protection seems to endure . I generally reapply a few times during the season , especially after very heavy , sustained rain.Not even Deer Off can protect plants during deer migration season , when the food supply is limited . During the fall and spring migrations , I still have to cover the plants or put up the electric fence . But from May through September , Deer Off keeps the deer away by itself.As I mentioned , the product is expensive , but it 's still cheaper than replacing plants all the time . And it 's a bargain compared to products that do n't work . I really am very satisfied with this product , and grateful to the nursery owner for recommended it ( and also for explaining how to apply it ) .	1
From the description it seems that this is made of a combination of garlic , pepper , and rotten egg ; but whater it is , it keeps the rabbits and squirrels out of my garden . It does stink at first , but in a day or 2 the smell starts to fade and by day 4 could not smell it .	1
Havahart DF32CP-4 Deer Off Repellent Concentrate is an all-natural organic formula that repels by taste and odor deer , rabbits , squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control , e.g . rabid . This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks , but rather for the suburban home and garden use . Its garlic , putrescent egg , and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens , lawns , and landscaped areas , but also some basements , cellars , and storage . However , it is ineffective against very determined animals .	1
I 'll be honest : I do n't really like giving products 5 stars unless I really think they stand far above the competition and/or I can see that its doing a fantastic job . The problem with this Deer Off is that I 'm not completely sure if deer are avoiding some plants because they 've been sprayed with it , or because ... well , it 's summer in the pacific northwest and everywhere you look there 's plenty of OTHER green things to eat.Giving it the benefit of the doubt : deer have n't eaten the plants sprayed with this stuff.But be weary : the deer have n't eaten nearby plants that have n't been sprayed with this stuff , either.On the other hand : my property has 4 deer living in the `` back 40 '' that routinely like to snack on everything . there are , without a doubt , deer nearby.At any rate , if you 're buying this concentrated stuff , but sure to:1 . Buy a sprayer of some sort . You need it to apply this stuff.2 . Plug your nose when mixing . Rotten eggs and hot peppers are the ingredients , and it smells like it.3 . After mixing into the sprayer that you buy , shake it up well , otherwise you 'll get little blobs of congealed ... something ... that 'll clog the nozzle.So far , I 'd recommend this stuff , but as fall and winter sets in ( and the green goes away ) , we 'll see if the deer will decide that they enjoy the spicy version of my plants .	1
When you open up the cap you can smell the hot pepper from several feet away . It 's about the same consistency as salad dressing . Be sure to dilute it enough if you 're using a sprayer . I only diluted it 50 % because I wanted it to be super strong and it was still too thick , it kept clogging the nozzle . Note that if you have a problem with cats using the vegetable garden as a kitty litter box , this product does n't seem to work on cats ; just other critters like rabbits and squirrels .	1
Deer off will keep , Deer , Rabbits and Squirrels away.I used it last year after the Deer chewed up some of my plants , and it did work . Although it put a white film on my green leafs..The Deer stayed away . The other bottle came with a sprayer , this one does not ! Since I grow Organic , it does say , do not spray on eatable plants . which i would not do . I cover my veggies with chicken wire.Make sure when using this , it is not Windy outside.It is a bit stinky , which the Deer do not like . It is made from sometype of Egg Solids.Mix concentrate thoroughly prior to mixing.Mix with tap water at a ratio of 1 part to 7 parts of water.Use 4 oz , of concentrate and 28oz of water to make 1 qt.32 oz of spray mixture.Contents of 1 quart bottle makes 2 gallons of spray when mixed with 7 quarts of water..Hope this helps..	1
i use this concentrate with the `` Havahart Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Repellent , Ready-to-Use Spray with battery powered sprayer '' Havahart DO64MS Squirrel Repellent BatteryThe small bottle of concentrate is equal to 4 bottles of the ready to use that comes with the battery powered sprayer.So it 's 1/4 of the price if you mix it up yourself .	1
We have loved the Deer Off products . This is very easy to use and very effective . Hay has gotten crazy expensive and we needed to keep deer out of the feed . We used this around the concrete pad before our hay was stacked . We have had no problem with deer getting into it . This comes in much larger sizes and we will be using those to keep our hay safe . It works effectively in high winds which I had concerns about . We also used it to keep rabbits out of my herbs . I do n't really care that they eat eh herbs , I care that the barn cat kills the babies horribly in front of my kids.This has helped us avoid bunny murders and save money- great product .	1
I was having such a problem getting the squirrels to stay out of my vegtables/corn I almost did not put a garden up this year . But I am glad I did-I sprayed this around the perimeter of my garden for two days and watched and waited . Did not see any paw prints in my garden and no little bits off the fruit either.Worked great !	1
While this repellent did clog our electric sprayer pretty quickly ( basically nothing came out ) , we have been desperate to protect our vegetable garden from the hoards of rabbits living on our property so I diluted this concentrate right into a watering can and applied it that way instead.I can say , it does work . And we would know if it did n't . When our garden is n't protected , we find the evidence of the rabbits ( and we see them plenty ) . There are burrow holes under our tomatoes , radishes half eaten , onions destroyed , spinach nibbled on . When we apply this repellent , however , the signs of rabbits all disappear for many days . We reapply more often than I 'd like , but I also will say , our rabbit population is extraordinarily huge where we garden ! If you 're looking for a repellent that is effective with rabbits , this one does work . I would just recommend that you look into different application methods , as it clogs sprayers quite well ! I do hope Deer Off addresses this issue soon , but for now , I 'm just happy we 're keeping the rabbits at bay .	1
You need a sprayer to use this . I recommend theSmith 190285 1-Gallon Bleach & Chemical Sprayer With Non-Corrosive 14-Inch Wand and Single Nozzle System . This is used in a 1:7 ratio with water and comes with a measuring cup on top . We have tons of deer on our property and this seems to be keeping them away . It even seems to work after a decent rain storm . I painted a 4 foot wide boarder between my manicured property and the woods where the deer inhabit . It has worked to keep the deer on their side of my invisible fence . I mixed it up a bit strong 2:7 , not 1:7 .	1
I 've used Deer Off for the last 2 years at my cabin which is in the woods with lots of deer & rabbits . My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall until I started using this product . The deer always browsed the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers . Since this is a vacation house , I 'm not there to chase off the deer . I think we have the same family of deer that come to our house & they have become turned off by the `` flavor '' of my bushes - at least for now . I 've watched the security camera footage of them ignoring the bushes . Yea ! I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.I already own the Deer Off battery sprayer for applying it to my plants . I make sure to run fresh soft water through it to clean it thoroughly before refilling the sprayer . I have not had any problems with clogging . I also follow the instructions for mixing this concentrate version with the correct amount of water.It is rain `` resistant '' & it did last through several significant rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it . I could still see the milky residue on the leaves although it had definitely washed off some of it . I reapplied it just to be sure . The 90-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain . You do have to apply more Deer Off to new growth.The milky residue is not terrible looking but it is visible up close ; I think it looks better than putting up fence around all the bushes . It does have a noticeable odor for a couple hours after application . You may want to consider that if you 're spraying near your patio & planning on having dinner there . But it 's not very offensive ; just kind of sour smelling & only until it dries .	1
We live deep in the woods . A day with deer in the yard , summer , winter , spring or fall , is the norm . However , in the winter , I could spray arsenic on our shrubs and the deer would still eat it . They get hungry in the dark of winter and eat holly bushes , evergreens , rhododendrons , and anything else no matter how close it is to the house.So Deer Off helps to deter them . For awhile . But not forever . But we are the exception I believe . It does seem to keep them off until they are really desperate or I just do n't get out often enough to reapply . When we have 12 '' of snow and it 's 20 degrees out , I 'm not in the mood to fill my sprayer and go out to save the shrubs . Really , who would be ? Is that the fault of Deer Off ? No.So I can tell you about this bottle . I 've used a prepackaged spray bottle of Deer Off before . It was hard work to get it to cover all we needed treated , even if it was battery powered . It was like washing a car with a toothbrush.At least with this , I can fill our four gallon sprayer and go to town . That means some additional work on my part to mix and measure and make sure the sprayer does n't clog but it also gets the job done more efficiently in the long run.I do n't care about the bunnies . The squirrels stopped coming for tea when I ditched the bird feeders . It 's really the deer that think we are an all you eat buffet . For now , they are surrounded by a plush forest full of fresh plants . But all bets are off in December .	1
Havahart Deer Off is among many egg and garlic based repellents . I 've used lots of brands , and found most to be effective if used conscientiously . Even though Deer Off says theirs is a weather resistant formula , I still follow a schedule of retreating after every rain or about once a month . Deer Off suggests every two to three months , but who wants to test those limits ? I like Deer Off 's concentrated form more than its ready-to-use counterpart . Making up smaller batches better suits my needs , and the sprayer does not clog using the diluted concentrated formula . I will never buy Deer Off ready-to-use again . Even though the sprayer was religiously cleaned after each application , it still clogged , rendering a big container useless . I also find Deer Off leaves a slight residue after drying , but it is negligible.I have success using this concentrate , but then again , have success with other deterrents too . The ingredient list for most brands are pretty much the same . Deer Off repels using scent and taste ( capsaicin added ) , whereas others deter simply by scent . Anyone who prefers a ready-to-use formula might want to tryLiquid Fence 112 Deer and Rabbit Repellent , 1-Quart Ready to UseorBobbex B550170 Ready to Use Deer Repellent with E-Z Pump Sprayer , 48-Ounce . Both come in a variety of sizes . Neither of those clog up and they are much more pungent than Deer Off .	1
I have a continuing problem with almost every variety of hungry visitor - rabbits , deer , squirrels - and try almost every product . The results are early with this one - but it seems to be protecting an area of my garden that takes particular abuse , especially from the rabbits . I am keeping my fingers crossed !	1
I used the Deer Off Repellent to keep the rabbits from eating my decorative plants . Bunnies are big problem in my yard . When they find a plant they like they do n't just take a few bites , they eat it to the ground . I use wire around my veggie garden but not for flowres . I also have bird feeders in my yard so I needed something non-toxic . Deer Off is made with natural ingredients and the package says it is safe around pets and children.Deer Off comes in a pre-mixed spray bottle or concentrate . I used the concentrate and mixed it for my own sprayer . I have tried using the pre-mixed sprayer and had trouble getting it to spray in a fine mist . When I went to use the remaining quarter of the bottle it was clogged up and would n't spray at all . Rinsing out the tubing for the sprayer did n't help . I prefer mixing just the amount I need and storing the rest for later . Plus it 's much cheaper to use the concentrate and your own sprayer.Does it work ? Yes , it keeps most of the bunnies away . There is still some chewing but I 'm not sure if it 's a bunny sampling the plant and moving on or some other animal , but there are no more completely devoured plants.The spray seemed safe for my plants , there was no damage or discoloration to the leaves or flowers . The product is supposed to smell bad to the animals but I did n't experience any unpleasant smell.Depending on the taste buds of the critters in your yard this may be the solution but from my experience it 's worth a try .	1
Its so amazing for me to see how God puts all things together . What we ca n't smell animals can ! I think its pretty incredible how people figure out what works to keep animals away from our gardens . ( Not for direct use on plants intended for human consumption ) . Jesus ' Blessings and Peace	1
it fixed my squirrel problems real fast . i have a huge container garden that i use to grow some plants that i love to grow . the squirrels were attracted to my nursery pots and they did a lot of damage to my plants and tore up a lot of my plants and the soil . i used deer off repellent and they did n't enter my yard period after that . i sat there in my lawn chair and watched those squirrels outside of my property line and just stood there looking . i will have to routinely spray this product around the perimeter of my garden to keep the squirrels out .	1
We applied this a few months ago and it did a nice job of saving the trees . We have quite a few deer roaming around our property and it was nice to see that they did not devour our trees ! It was interesting to see the deer approach the trees , but actually ate only the grass underneath the trees but did not touch the big , leafy threes themselves . I guess everyone will have a different experience but for my money , this is my go-to repellent .	1
I bought this to rid my yard of squirrels and it works great ! I apply a liberal amount around the trunk of each tree and on the tops of the branches where they like to sit . The very next day - no more squirrels . It lasts about two weeks before I need to reapply and the next application works just as well.This concentrate is a nice economical way to refill the large container I originally purchased . It takes up less space in the garage .	1
I do not have a problem with Deers . I do have a probllem with rabbits and mole and lizzards and frogs . I am glad to say that The Deer Off has seemed to make an impact on the for now . I have notice a decline in these critters around my property . I live next to a wooded lot and would like to keep the animals and critters in the woods . Before I could not even put my garbage out and now I can.This has worked so far I havenot seen any frogs trying to jump in my pool or creepy crawlies running about as well .	1
Squirrels dig up all the plants in my small backyard in the fall and sit on my fence and throw black walnut shells against the white paint on my garage , staining it deeply . I ignored this product for a long time assuming it was toxic and because I did not want to get rid of the squirrels completely . Once I realized it really was a safe mix that would n't kill everything , I thought it would be nice to try . And it is . I can put a very small amount on boxed plants and on my fence without scaring the squirrels out of the yard completely . Comes with an easy to use mixing dish that stores easily .	1
We do n't get a lot of animal damage in our community garden , but we have had a little squirrel problem . After 25 days of use , we have n't had any problem , so this product is quite useful .	1
This works fine as part of my deer-repelling arsenal . I like it being concentrated as it takes up less space in my garage . However , it could be a lot more concentrated - it only makes 2 gallons and is still over 90 % water.Studies have shown that deer do n't like strange smells ( which is why some people have luck with even hair or soap ) , but they get used to a smell so you need to switch the sprays regularly . I switch this with a couple of other commercial sprays and a homemade one of eggs , garlic , tabasco ( the three basic ingredients in this spray ) and a little dish soap . The homemade spray works well , but it does not have chemicals in it that will allow it to stick to the leaves during a rain . ( Scientific studies have said the same thing ) . Their claim that it will last 90 days is bizarre unless you live in an area with absolutely no rain . A couple of weeks ( depending on the amount of rain ) is more likely.Note that this and any spray that uses eggs can not be used on edibles . The Havahart Spray Away Elite II Hose-Free Motion Activated Sprinkler Animal Repellent 5269 is expensive but working pretty good for that .	1
I got this product for one thing only , to keep the squirrels off of my bird feeder . Not the actual feeder , but the long pole from which the feeders hang . If I was sure it would n't deter the birds , I would put it on the feeder itself . The problem is , it has been raining in Georgia almost every single day for the last two weeks , so I do n't know how effective it is . I have n't seen the squirrels climb up as normal , but I 'm not sure if it 's just because I throw a slipper at the window and they 've associated the feeder with a loud noise , or if it 's because of this product . I promise to come back and update when we have consecutive rainy days !	1
We do n't have deer or rabbit problems , but we do have trouble with squirrels . Ours are n't the cute little squirrels that I remember from my childhood that would rap on the window for peanuts and even come up and take them out of our hands . No , these are squirrels that can climb up a straight wall of stucco or brick and chew holes in the eves to get into the attic . And if they see you outside as they 're making their ascent , the language that comes out of their mouths I 'm sure would be censored if I could understand squirrel talk . They tease the dogs and cats by hanging from branches or walls just out of reach and chattering nasty things . So although this repellent is advertised to protect vegetation , I noticed that several other reviewers had some luck with making a perimeter of the yard to keep the squirrels away . We 'll try anything . ( We already had someone come in and put heavy gauge wire around the eves and have tried live trapping and relocating them . That helped some . We really do n't want to use poison . ) I mixed the product according to directions and sprayed it around the base of the house and around some trees and fences in the yard . It has a pretty bad smell , but not as bad as I had expected . After a couple days I did n't notice the smell anymore . The time we really notice the squirrels is in the winter when they try to get in out of the cold , and I 'm waiting until then to actually spray inside the attic if we need to do that because if using it around the perimeter works , I 'd rather not have the smell in the attic . So far I have n't seen any squirrels hanging around . They seem to have found more hospitable places to go . If this keeps working it will be a godsend in the winter when we have a bigger problem . I 'm giving the product 4 stars because it seems to be working , and I 'll upgrade it to 5 stars if it continues to be effective in the winter .	1
We have over 30 young fast growing tress that are attracting deer every evening . I decided to put this on the fencing that is around the tress as a test and every single one that I used the deer off on has no bitten leaves . The deer knew which ones did not have the product on . I have since sprayed this on all of the trees and and am very thankful I finally found a product that works.The best thing about the application process is that you do not have to wait for a specific season , which most of competitors ask . I used this late july/ early august with optimal results . There was no plant or grass damage afterward . I did however wait a few days after the rain to apply just to be sure and the product seemed to work instantly .	1
Seriously - this stuff smells good enough to put on my scrambled eggs . I do n't use a sprayer . so I diluted this in water and splashed on and around the area I want to protect . My main varmints are bunnies and squirrels - eating my flowers , chewing through my landscaping power cables and drip water system supply lines . The squirrels even damage the chainlink fence - they chew through the wires holding the fence to the supports . So I diluted this stuff in water and splashed the fence , wires , and drip system . No more chewing damage !	1
I have three large oak trees on my property and lots of squirrels . I hate it when the get into my garbage cans . They will even chew through plastic covers to get inside . The also jump from some of my smaller trees onto my roof.I used this around my garbage cans and small trees . It works . I still see squirrels in my yard but they are staying away from my garbage cans and the smaller trees near my house.I like the fact that this is safe for animals and humans . It seems to last despite some rain storms . It does not any noticeable odor.This keeps the squirrels away . It is not toxic and lasts despite rain storms . It is a great product .	1
To be honest , it 's hard to tell how well this product is working . I have n't had any deer damage since applying it , but I have n't seen the 2 deer around that were always in my yard either , since then . ( I live in a very rural forested mountainous area . They might have headed up to the high country for the hot summer . ) So I 'm giving it the benefit of the doubt , will update later . I have used a similar product , Liquid Fence , that worked pretty well . Both products smell really bad at first , but the odor does n't last , for us humans , at least . And Deer Off claims to last longer , also includes capsaicin ( hot pepper ) . It has a convenient measuring cap attached .	1
Flushing little critters that find their way under our deck is a job best left for our spaniel , but unfortunately , the long barking session that accompanies the discovery can be an ordeal in itself.Some of this between the slats not only saves me from crawling around down there , but also is an often obeyed UNwelcome mat for critters.It even seems to work on the opossums and raccoons.The scent is n't as disgusting as some others , and so far is working for us .	1
After a very rabbit-filled spring , this product promised what we needed ! Quite a few plants in our flowerbeds have been chewed off by rabbits this year , and I was having difficulty outsmarting them in order to save what was left.This product is a concentrate , so you 'll need a sprayer to hold the solution after mixing with water . I used a 3 gallon pressure sprayer , and that seemed to work quite well with this product.After the first application , a few of the plants I sprayed still got chewed , but I figured that they have to try eating the plants to find out how bad they taste . Each time it rained or we watered the plants , I reapplied the spray . Since I did n't have many flowers left , I did n't want to wait and see how long the spray would hold up without reapplication.I was pleasantly surprised to see that after the first time of chewing on the sprayed plants , the rabbits started leaving them alone . Apparently , they realized that they could eat the acre of turf grass that they crossed to get to my flowerbeds instead of chewing on plants that now taste like rotten eggs and spicy pepper ! I would have preferred that the rabbits realized that the plants were sprayed before they took another round of plants , but after they did so , the product seems to be doing its job . If you have problems with animals eating your plants , I think this is worth a try . Just make sure to apply it early in the year to discourage them right away so you do n't lose any more plants than you have to .	1
This version of Deer Off is a concentrate to be mixed in a 7 to one ratio . The user is then directed to spray the solution on plants to be protected . A handy lid with clearly marked measurements makes achieving the correct mixture very easy . I did n't find the Deer Off scent unpleasant , and any scent it did have dissipated rather quickly and not detected by my human senses.In the past I 've had mixed results with the Deer Off products , mostly with failed protection after a rain event . This current test is more successful . I mixed the Deer Off in a watering can and sprinkled it on my few remaining lilies and a stand of hosta . In past years deer have ravaged both deer and lilies early in the season . This year the plants are winning and not because there are no deer . I 've seen them in our backyard this summer eating seed out of the bird feeders.The plants out front are faring well even after a heavy rain event . Usually I repeat the application of repellent after a rain , but this time I did n't to see what would happen . So far so good.If the lilies and hosta meet an untimely demise , I 'll update this review . No news will be good news .	1
We live out in the country where deer are more abundant than flies . Keeping the deer from munching on our fruit trees , blueberry bushes , and other plants has been an ongoing battle . ( Okay , battle may be too violent of a word , as neither party has actually drawn weapons , but you get the picture . ) Our particular breed of deer can navigate through deer netting , ignore bright shiny objects , and have built up a high tolerance to the presence of dog and human hair . Yes , we have tried everything.To say that I set my expectations low for Deer Off ... well let 's just say I believed it was more likely that Harrison Ford dressed as Han Solo would show up at my front door than this spray would actually keep the critters from chomping on the vegetation.Hubby followed the quick easy directions , mixing the salsa-with-egg smelling Deer Off concentrate with water , and sprayed as directed on our myriad of trees and plants . Here it is a week later , despite entire families of deer traipsing through our front yard , and there is still no sign of Bambi eating blueberries . ( By the way , you are not suppose to spray Deer Off on anything you would eat , but you can spray around these plants . Seems to work . ) So yes , I would highly recommend Deer Off to repel deer from your plants and trees .	1
I like Deer Off . It works great to keep squirrels , deer , and raccoons away from decorative trees , plants , and shrubs . I mix Deer Off as directed , and either spray it on with my hose sprayer , or paint it on . Then , I reapply it from time-to-time when I feel enough of it has washed off to reduce its effectiveness . Deer Off has a most unpleasant odor and you will want to avoid getting it on your clothes . Keep this product away from anything that humans or pets might eat . I have lattice on my deck railing that a Fisher Cat climbs to access my roof , his favorite spot for scouting prey , because small animals keep an eye on the trees and brush and not houses . After painting the lattice and roof where the Fisher Cat climbs up , the critter has stayed away . Electronic repellers did not work , but Deer Off did . Chipmunks and moles still eat my flower bulbs from under the ground . Deer Off is not perfect , but it has solved many of my plant protection problems .	1
Last summer I found that the Deer Off II with battery controlled sprayer saved my new rose bush so I was eager to to try this concentrated version . It works just as well but takes more effort to use . First you have to mix it and the full directions are for a much larger amount than I need at any given time . The bottle also gives ratios for mixing so you need to figure that out to how much you need and mix it accordingly.I re-used the bottle and battery controlled sprayer and the product worked just as well as it did last summer . As with the previous Deer Off product you 'll need to respray after moderate rainfall I 've found and the product can discolor the leaves and flower petals a bit if you put too much on . That 's a challenge because you 'll have to experiment to get a feel for how much is too much too keep the critters at bay .	1
Deer-Off is one of those products that does what it 's supposed to do with a minimum of muss and fuss . I tried other products to keep my plants ( especially hostas ) from the clutches of freeloading deer and other varmints , but with varying degrees of success . Deer-Off worked the first time I tried it , and it has worked every time since . If I apply it , I know I do n't have to worry about my prized plants becoming tonight 's critter salad bar . However , this product is n't cheap , and if you follow the label directions , you 'll need to re-apply every 90 days ( more if you get a lot of rain ) . True , 32oz . of Deer Off seems like a huge amount of repellent , but it takes two bottles a year to treat our rather large lot as directed . Granted , I 'm happy to pay a fair price for a product that works well -- I just wish the price of this particular product was n't quite so high .	1
We have used the Havahart Deer Off II Repellent in the past and found it to work really well . Although it worked well , it came in a ready-to-use battery operated jug with a sprayer that gave us some issues . This particular product is concentrated so you need to mix it with water and then you can apply as needed . Applying this concentrated repellent was less hassle than the ready-to-use sprayer was . We prefer this option.Our pest problem is/was Rabbits . They like to leave `` beans '' in our yard that attract our dog to it . She goes crazy for them . Yuck ! We do everything we can to prevent her from getting to them but every now and then she 'll get one and it sickens us . Luckily when we use this product the beans disappear indicating that the rabbits are gone . They like chewing on our Apple Tree too ( at least I 'm assuming that 's what 's chewing on it ) so I 'm happy to have these critters gone.We 're not in an area where we see Deer and I do n't think I 've seen a squirrel in years so I ca n't say how this product does for those critters but I can at least attest that this product works well for keeping away the rabbits.I would recommend this product .	1
Deer are not a problem for our garden but rabbits and in particular squirrels are . We have raised beds but it does n't slow either rabbits and of course not the squirrels down . I sprayed this around the base of the planter boxes and although I cant say for sure it has stopped every varmint from crossing , it certainly has made a big positive difference . It will be interesting to see what the duration of the effect is .	1
This product is labeled as `` Deer Off '' but it says it works for rabbits also . We have had terrible rabbit problems in our decorative garden . They eat a lot of the young plants so we gave this a try . The product is a liquid mix for mixing with water . It comes with a cup . The cup is a little small so the required proportion results in the cup being full to the top of the cup making it inconvenient to use as it could spill easily . The product properly mixed is then sprayed onto the plants that you need protection . You are not supposed to use it on plants that will be eaten . The plants we have that have been sprayed with this product have not been touched by rabbits for about a week which is a pretty good indication that it works . We will need more time to be more sure but it looks very good . There is a strong smell to it but that is not really an issue . It is supposed to be made of natural ingredients . I would not put it on vegetables that you will eat but for decorative plants and flowers , this stuff is good for repelling rabbits at least . For other animals , we do not really know . It is supposed to work with the smell to alert the animals that either it is not suitable that there are preditors around .	1
This is not the first product of this type I have reviewed for Amazon . I love these because they all seem to work well . Just mix it up and spray it on . How simple is that ? I do not mind mixing it because I have a deer sprayer bottle already and this bottle is smaller and uses less plastic . I find that the smell is not as bad as the others but that may be my sinuses helping me avoid the torture of that awful rotten egg smell.I sprayed it according to the package and hoped the rain would hold off so this could soak in . Well it rained so I sprayed it again when the leaves dried.I live on the edge of a wildlife preserve so I basically ring the dinner bell everyday . My plants do not get a chance to grow much they keep getting chewed on . I even buy plants that are deer friendly but when a deer is hungry they will eat just about anything.I was very happy to see that some of my bushes that are chewed most of the time , are growing little new leaves . That shows me the deer are leaving them alone.So far so good . This spray seems to be working out nicely .	1
This trap is well made and does exactly as it says . The trigger is definitely sensitive so beware ! I bought it to catch a feral cat in my area and I put little amounts of food leading into the trap and sure enough , I caught her ! Getting her spayed ... The quality is much greater than the cost . The cost is extremely reasonable .	1
This is a good size trap that has enough room to catch a relatively large animal . I needed one to catch the critters the were destroying my vegetable garden.The instructions to setup the trap are a little confusing , but if you 're mechanically-inclined , it 's not terribly difficult to figure out . The product also claims it 's rust-resistance , but that 's not a true claim . I 'm already starting to see some evidence of rust after only about a month 's use.Aside from that , the product works . I caught a stray animal within the first week of putting the trap out in the yard . You 'll need to be clever about the bait that you use and might have to play around to find the right combination . I found out , for example , that dry cat food does n't work so well , but fresh tuna out of the can seemed to do the trick . Also , if you have slugs in your yard like I do , they will swarm the bait and eat it up so you 'll need to have a replenishment plan .	1
Need to watch assembly video on utube . Instructions are really bad . Takes about 5 - 10 minutes to assemble trap . The trap works really well . After catching the stray cat in one day , I then folded the trap back up and back into the box , till the next stray cat comes around Yes well worth it .	1
This trap works and is large enough to trap cats and possums . The animal can be freed in two ways : opening the end with the slanted solid panel OR opening the opposite end , which is secured with a wire and requires more effort . Using the easier way ( solid panel ) means that you must hold that end open ; it 's the end that closes to trap the animal . The other side is the one you open to put the food in . The directions state to put the trap standing longways to open this end , then turn it upside down to get the animal out . Other than this , the only way to release the animal is to use a stick to prop open that side . I had an issue with the possums being too afraid to walk out , so I propped the side closest to the trap mechanism open with a stick and left the cage so the animal would eventually leave . ( Trying to dump the possum out was an option , but they are very good at clinging to the wire frame of the cage , and I did n't want to hassle it out . ) The only thing you should know is that you might have to bend the long rod that sets the trap off ; bend it to make it `` shorter '' . This is because the rod is too long ( as least mine was ) , so stepping on the trigger plate did nothing at first . Bending the rod a bit then testing setting it off is the way to fix this , otherwise the trap wo n't work . I uploaded an image to show how I bent mine ( top of page , click view customer images ) .For cats , I used pieces of sardine on top of a slice of bread ( to keep it off the ground ) . This worked for a cat and two possums . I 'm only trying to catch cats , but the possums are a problem because they seem to find the trap and get caught in it . So , if you 're trying to catch any cats , do n't release the possums because they will just come back again and drag out the time it takes for you to catch the cats . I think the possums have more a snout that catches the odor of the sardines , so they 're quick to get caught.Another thing : if you are transporting the animal in your vehicle , you should put sheets of newspaper under the trap because the animals might relieve themselves in fright during the ride.For cleanup , I would suggest bringing the trap to a car wash that has the high pressure nozzles .	1
I purchased two of these traps for my folks home . They are having a cat problem . Cat are leaving dropping around and harrasing the family bird in the back yard . People Spay or Neuter your car-Bob Barker . I set up the traps in the back yard . I bought cheap cat food tins , or tuna cans if I ran the first one . Just study where the cats enter your property and leave the trap activated with food . I like using an old bed sheet cut to the shape of the trap . So as not give off the shiny factor of the trap . Animals are more suspicious of shiny new objects than covered up ones . Plus having something over your cage calms the cat down and wont be meowing as much during the night once they are trapped . As I put these traps up , snap in 10 minutes . Animal Control in my area only takes feral cats and not cats that are domesticated . But less cats in my area .	1
I bought this to trap some feral cats . It worked a couple of times in different locations and now I think they are getting wise to me . Still , the trap is well constructed and works as advertised . And it does fold up nice and small for storage . i use tuna as a lure . Anyone suggest anything better ?	1
First off I will tell you I have had this rake for over 2 years and have used it for over 50 hours as a guess.Still in the same shape as when I got it.This rake really is easy to use -- seems to take much less effort and results are great . Lightweight and almost makes raking fun ! Leaves do n't tend to stick in the tines which makes the chore go faster . Very Well built . Worth the extra money vs a cheap rake .	1
This Fiskars rake is basically the same exact thing as any other rake I 've ever used . I have two complaints- one , it clogs leaves very easily , which of course means constantly stopping to pull the leaves away , and two , it 's not as sturdy as it might appear . Mine has n't exactly broke yet , but I get the feeling it will in a couple months . Those are my only complaints . The long handle is nice , too . Helps out my achy breaky back after all those snowstorms we stinkily had to experience last winter .	1
This is a very good leaf rake and of good use here in Bayou Chicot Louisiana . We have lots of trees here and the leafs are a big deal . Winter winds blow these leafs all over our yard so this leaf rake is of great use .	1
The wide 24-inch rake head is beneficial for large or small jobs . With the wind blowing in our area the majority of the time , it is not just leaves we have to rake up . The wide gerth is a plus . The durability and build of the product is acceptable . The handle is sturdy . We will have this for a long time to use unless our family decides to borrow it !	1
Best leaf rake I ever owned . The 5ft lightweight aluminum handle is perfect for us & # 34 ; mature & # 34 ; individuals who prefer things easy to use . The rake part adds another foot to the length and is two feet wide at the very tip end . The plastic rake part is attached to the aluminum pole with a single screw . That makes it a simple task if the rake part needs replacing . This garden tool makes raking almost a pleasure.Prime members can have this delivered to your door for just under 16 bucks . That is one heck of a deal for such a fine rake . This is a winner .	1
I used this rake to rake leaves and dead grass out of my yard . The great thing about this rake is it is VERY light weight and has a long handle to make raking easier . The rake also has a large rake head making it easier to get more done , and makes picking up the piles easy as well . I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a rake !	1
Works great to clean up all the leaves I did not rake last fall . Looks like it will hold up well .	1
Best leaf rake out there.Love the long teardrop-shaped handle.Very comfortable.The head/plastic tines have held up over the last few years.No breakage . Works very well for a chore not many enjoy..	1
COULD THIS BE THE BEST LEAF RAKE EVER ? Bought mine at LOWES a couple of years ago to replace another plastic-tined rake which I had been very pleased with . Was astounded at the comfort and effectiveness of the Fiskars rake vs. my old rake whose tines had been worn off . Loaned it to a neighbor - a recent college grad from one of the area 's big engineering schools - very shortly later he had his own Fiskars ! Living in a veritable Druid 's grove of various Quercus species , some of them with thin LIVE OAK type leaves , I have found this rake to be capable of gathering most of those with one pass.Fiskars promotes this rake with the slogan : LESS WORK ; MORE WEEKENDBelieve it . [ and thanks Fiskars engineers for a super product ! ] TECHNICAL HI-LITES1 . TINES : are VERY sturdy and durable but you will need your garden rake to move big and/or damp piles of leaves2 . HANDLE : long enough for taller people but fine for shorter ones . The egg-shaped cross section allows much weight reduction yet provides great strength and it provides a level of comfort and fatigue-resistance that has to be experienced to be believed.Disclaimer : Other than using their products I have absolutely no ties to Fiskars .	1
This rake is light weight , sturdy handle . It felt a little on the cheap side first time I held it but it has proven to be a lot more stout than I gave it credit for initally . Hasnt broken , lost teeth , or cracked . Good price , good rake .	1
This is another innovative and quality product by Fiskar . The rake is very light with a flexible clog free design , perfect for gently scraping your lawns clean without ripping up the grass or raking away your garden mulch . The design of the rake also allows you to use it at more angles so you do n't need to throw the rake ahead of you and pull it diagonally against the lawn like classic curved v-shaped rakes . The user experience is analogous to a indoor broom rather than a big stiff leaf rake.The handle has an innovative oblong design which fits perfectly into your hand and helps you to maintain rake orientation , particularly in gloved hands.I have found that the orange sleeve has tendency to slide up the handle , but it 's too long to come completely off unless you are really determine to remove it.Overall it 's the best yard rake you 're going to find !	1
Bought this rake based on the reviews I read here . Best rake I have ever owned . I have had it for over a year and have left it out in the rain on occassion but it still works great .	1
I have used this smaller 8 '' wide version of this Fiskars rake for a while ( Fiskars 9661 8-Inch Shrub Rake ) . The rake head is made of very pliable plastic , which tends to hold lighter materials like leaves and grass , and leave behind heaver objects , like rocks . The design works very well , but the problem with the soft plastic is that over time , a number of the tines had broken off . In need of a replacement , I bought this full-sized 24 '' wide model , because it was available for about $ 18 . So for less money , I got a rake that covers three times the area.The larger 24 '' rake also does a good job of raking up leaves and grass cuttings , while leaving rocks and other heavier debris behind . Because it is much wider , I ca n't scrape down hard on the ground as easily as I could with the smaller rake . This is probably a good thing , as it means that it will be harder to accidentally break off one of the tines.With about a 55 '' long aluminum handle , this rake is relatively light in weight . Any rake with a head this wide will generally require a little muscle to use , but this Fiskars rake is probably easier to manage , and takes less energy to use , than an equally sized rake with a hard plastic head . I use the big Fiskars rake to gather my lawn cuttings into a pile , and then switch to the smaller one to get them into a dustpan . Four stars for now , but will upgrade to five , if the rake holds up well under use .	1
... I am not the best splitter ever , but with this ax even i get a decent amount of wood chucked.Easy to maintain , light weight , very well balanced ... .all in all a good axe.As always , if you have questions please ask , I always try to answer	1
Got it from ebay , had a paypal plus balance and a very good price . This is just like other Fiskars great !	1
Thanxs Fiskar for making a truly great axe , great balance , great handle , excellent blade . In Short , It is PERFECT , thanxs again to Amazon and Fiskars .	1
Somehow I am always a little surprised by how short the fiskar products are when I receive them in the mail , but eventually I get used to the length . The product came well packaged and I liked that it comes with the safety cover , which is important for me since I have little ones who get curious about the tools . I 've used this product the last two days to help me cut deep roots in an area where we had a tree cut down and I am ow converting into a flower bed . I was able to get most of the roots out except for a few that I will just have to cover over and out a planter in that area . I ordered the Fiskars tool sharpener which seemed to help a few times after using the axe in the dirt and somewhat moist clay soil . I would definitely recommend this tool .	1
This is not an axe for splitting large logs , although it could handle moderately sized logs just fine . It may sound like paranoia , but we live on an island , and so one reason I bought this is to keep it in the attic . After hearing about hurricanes that have trapped folks in their homes for lack of a way to get out of an attic , I thought it better safe than sorry to have one one hand should the need ever arise . I do n't do a lot of splitting of wood here.The weight feel good and well balanced , and the flare on the handle makes the likelihood of letting if slip out of my hand unlikely . I 'm pleased with this axe for the value , and have always been impressed with Fiskars products .	1
It will be hard to beat this little axe for handling light- to middle-weight chopping chores around the home or campsite . I love all of Fiskars products , however , so this is just one of the latest I 'm happy to give my seal of approval .	1
I chop wood with this axe and the wood simply explodes . It is a rare log that does not fully split with one medium heavy swing . Using this axe is like putting dynamite inside the wood . If you split wood with an axe you have to buy this product . You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product , and no , I do not work for the company . Wish I did . All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful . I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally . The handle , the look , the design , the price . This is a top of the line product . Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money . Ohhh , Just had a thought ... .I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well . The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk . It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed , but I did not return it to the vendor , too much hassle . The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them .	1
used this to dig a hole to plant a small plant . It got the job done.IO stuck it in the ground , put my foot on the top edge pushed down . And into to the ground it went . Dug a hole . Fantastic ! It was delivered fast in one piece.I would tell anyone looking for a shovel this one works .	1
great deal ... seven bucks and I could not find one for under twenty bucks at the local hardware stores very happy . Just bought another one .	1
It was like $ 6 and works great as a digging shovel . I ca n't complain at all ! We use this all the time , hopefully it will work for years and years to come . And if it does n't . it was only $ 6 . : )	1
Handle is not finished at all so I need to paint or something - even with gloves it feels very rough . but the price was great .	1
A decent value - for the price , you have a decent buy . It would not last for someone who is a professional , or for a homeowner who has lots and lots of digging to do , but for an average guy/gal , it 's a good tool . One thing though , if you let the handle get even damp , it swells and gets rough , so do n't forget to wear gloves ... no gloves = blisters , you 've been warned : D !	1
Needed something to fill in some holes around the rental house . This is perfect for that job , was a price point that worked for me especially given that it will be left in the shed at a rental . We will see how long it holds up , and it creaks and groans a little when doing some deep digging , so I would n't expect it to do commercial duty work . But if you need a shovel for general around the yard use , this seems to work perfectly .	1
I have lots of sprayers - I own a small farm so there is a lot of spraying to do . I own the Solo backpack ( too heavy and cumbersome - does n't want to fit through small places or doors ) the 1 gallon Hudson sprayer ( okay , but I do n't like the spray - it tends to spit instead of spray - and needs a lot of pumping - you have to pump it while it is on the ground , so if you are spraying a lot you are leaning over a lot ) and the spray-n-grow sprayers ( needs four batteries and wo n't take rechargeable batteries - and also tends to spit instead of spray ) .This is the best of the lot - it has a really nice atomizing type of spray - I like the over-spray attachment . It does n't take much pumping to spray for quite a bit . Has a nice lock feature . Best of all its nicely balanced - I am only 5 ' tall with small hands and it works nicely for me . Easy refilling and easy cleaning.At this price you could have one for each type of product you use . I do n't use chemicals - everything is pretty much organic sprays for fertilizing - it does n't clog and I like that . So now I use the big solo for neem and the little one for fertilizing .	1
Purchase this sprayer to squirt the neighbors little yappy dog that they do not exercise or have taught it not to bark at other much larger dogs and people . The dog will bark the entire time I am out with my Labs in the back yard playing with them after work or on weekend . They will let the dog out and it charges the fence and barks it head off the entire time I am out any where from 10 minutes to an hour . This does the job , I squirt the dog and it runs back inside and stands and barks at us , at least it is muffled and the barking annoys its owners too .	1
This works very well for spraying the garden with insect soap . I would n't be without one . This one I purchased for my daughter because mine works so well .	1
Here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES of this device ... ADVANTAGES.1 . It produces a fine mist to a stream - the best combination that I have ever experienced..2 . It is an excellent replacement for the average pump sprayer..3 . The construction material is very durable..4 . The balance is very good..5 . The device is light..6 . The nozzle design is ingenious - it can pivot up and down within 180 degrees ... DISADVANTAGES.1 . At $ 18 , it is very expensive . You can purchase six regular pump sprayers for the price of one .	1
I purchased this item to use as a sprayer for BBQing . I make up my & # 34 ; mop & # 34 ; or spray and pour into the solo sprayer , works great !	1
This little beauty is just what I have been looking for . It pumps up in seconds , smoothly , too . Just a twist of the lid and it releases the pressure . The handle fits my hand and the pivoting spray head lets me get the water on the plants instead of the wall . More pumps = more pressure and bigger spray . Thick plastic , lock on spray button . The little cone helps contain diameter of the spray . I love this thing . Holds just enough water , but , not so much that it 's heavy .	1
I have had many hand sprayers before and this one works the best . You wo n't be disappointed like iI was with the many different sprayers i have had before .	1
Bought this to spray my veggies with neem oil.It 's light weight , and easy to tote around . The tilting sprayer made it easy to get underneath the leaves . Once it 's pumped up it provides a powerful , even mist.For the price , this ca n't be beat . It 's sufficiently large for my small garden .	1
I love this sprayer ! Pumping it up is not difficult and lasts for several minutes of solid spraying . I 've mostly used it to spray insecticidal soap and the coverage is excellent .	1
Used for Morning Glories . I bought many of these to help my flowers cover up my water softener , AC etc . That way I can just move the netting if I need to access the items . works great	1
This netting is exactly what it should be : strong , easy to mount on stakes/fences , and the gaps are the right width for most climbing vines and veggies .	1
I waited to do this review until the plants in the vertical portion of my square foot garden were in full bloom.The trellis was easy to put up , very light weight and very sturdy.It is holding up loads of heavy cucumbers , lima beans , pole beans and crowder peas ( which have very heavy leaves and vines ) in multiple garden beds . The squares are large enough that I can reach my hands through it to harvest plants on the interior of the garden beds easily.This has been a great investment ! Highly recommend.UPDATE : 4/1/13 spring garden season has begun and this will be the third year for my trellis netting . Think this might be the last year , but note that I have left it ouside on the frame this entire time -- too lazy to take down and put up each year . If you were to store it in off season I 'm guessing you could get five years out of this product .	1
The beans I purchased and planted were destroyed from the root by opossums after numerous trees in our area were destroyed so I ca n't tell you if this would have worked because I never got to use it for my beans , cucumbers and other veggies . I 'll be back to update this next Summer ( 2014 ) .	1
This trellis netting work great for vertical growing . Whether you have limited space , or like me have problems crawling around on the ground , it provides an upright growing space for vines like cukes , and is great for peas . It is n't bird netting - wo n't keep the berry-eating feathered friends away .	1
Romaine Parris lettuce is fantastic . It 's so good you can actually eat it right out of the bag ! Yes that 's right- you do n't always have to make a salad out of lettuce . There 's no rule that says you have to eat lettuce with dressing and combine it with other vegetables . I 've always believed that eating lettuce the way it 's presented is the healthiest and most pleasurable way to enjoy it . Not that I do n't like eating salads occasionally . I do n't want to contradict myself here since I just wrote a review for Italian Robusto salad dressing . It 's just that , you know , lettuce by itself is sometimes the perfect way to munch on a healthy food . Anyway sorry for the little ramble there . I tend to do that . Just make sure you get your fill by indulging in some fantastic lettuce . Romaine lettuce is the way to go for the best in nutrition , enjoyment and a perfect snack .	1
This lettuce has been the easiest vegetable I have grown , along with spinach . Both just sprang right up from seeds . It came up fast and is producing much faster than I had expected.I did have to get some `` safe '' spray because there were gnat-like things flying around and I wanted to make sure not to spray my lettuce with anything I did n't want to eat later . The carrots nearby may have attracted those flying creatures . Oh well . That happens . My Romaine Parris Lettuce looks BEAUTIFUL and tastes delicious.I started by soaking the seeds in water and then planted them in a heated seed-starting tray with a heated mat and it 's self-watering . That made it easy , even for me ! As soon as the seeds sprouted , I transferred them to the Earth Box and almost all of my seeds/seedlings are doing well.I wish I had planted more , but I sure am enjoying it , although it 's almost too pretty to pick . Next time I 'm going to plant much more of it .	1
In south Texas this is a winter crop , and we 've had temps as low as 15 this year with no complaints from the lettuce . We harvest the individual leaves as needed , so we do n't have storage problems , always fresh Romaine for salads and sandwiches . I think every seed germinated and after thinning they grew into nice , store-sized plants ... more than we could eat , for sure . Delicious lettuce .	1
The seeds came up very quickly . That is what matters and they did great . I have lots of little lettuce plants that came up within a day or two of planting . Other seeds take weeks . Not these	1
grew immediately and really healthy unfortunately the long non-stop rain in my area washed them out . I am replanting to try again .	1
Romaine Lettuce is easy to grow and adds variety to a garden plot . I have planted this variety several times with good result . The seed is reliable and germinates readily . Tips for planting:1 . Make sure your garden plot gets at least 8 hours of sunlight per day for optimal growth2 . Prepare the soil by tilling and perhaps adding a fertilizer ( 10:10:10 , or manure ) . This will cause the plant to grow faster and with more green lush.3 . Water every day lightly for about 2 weeks , then water every other day . Lettuce has a high water content , so the soil can not get too dry or the plant will begin to wilt . Some peat moss worked into the soil before planting helps maintain water.4 . Since the seeds are small it is hard to get the plants spaced properly . Once the sprouts come up , space the plants out to all for optimal growth.5 . When harvesting , clip the leaves with a scissors rather than tearing.This is a great tasting lettuce and is sure to please.kone	1
I had a very good germination rate with these and have about 20 heads growing outside right now with much success ! I 'm very happy with these seeds !	1
This deck box is sturdy , good looking and hides all my potting gadgetry so the deck looks tidy . It also provides a serving area for parties . The largest sized box is a lot bigger than I expected and holds a considerable amount of stuff . Water does n't get into it when it rains so things are protected from the weather . It was mostly easy to assemble even though the directions are n't ideal , and is sturdy enough to hold two grandchildren who immediately decided it was a great 'fort ' . Once I 'd filled it with my large containers of bird seed , a tub of gardening products , bags of soil , tools , extra pots , etc. , there was no room for kids anymore -- just as well -- but it held together well during their rambunctious play at first.I 'm so pleased with the big one , I decided to buy the smaller one to put out near my veggie garden where I can store those gardening tools close by and have things safe from the weather , plus I 'll have a place to sit while I water .	1
I have one outside on my deck and a second one in my garage . They have each held up very nicely . If you assemble them correctly ( and trust me it 's easy to NOT do it correctly ) they are very solid . The problem some are having is they are failing to assemble them correctly and sadly the design allows that to mistakenly happen . Rubbermaid needs to do something to address this . When it 's put together wrong you 'll definitely get people saying they do n't hold up .	1
I 'm not sure why some reviewers have had problems with this falling apart , but i have n't had any problems with mine and I move it around the patio all the time and on occasion even use it as a bench.I really ca n't come up with any reason why anyone would have a problem with this . I use it to store my hose , sprinkler , and yard tools with room to spare . This box is very secure and water tight . It is designed so it can be locked up . All you need is a lock which is not included.It has been exposed to the elements here which include scorching hot sunshine , torrential rain , freezing cold , hail , sleet , and a lot of snow . It is fade resistant and while not exactly fashionable , it is unobtrusive and works with anything and conveniently fits in any corner and can stay outside all year long .	1
I will have to create this review with one caveat.We just got the box today and assembled it today -- it is untested but seems great . It 's main purpose for us is to hold pool chemicals over the Winter instead of housing them in our larger pool shed . It fit MORE than enough buckets of various leftover chlorine tabs and algae stuff . Fantastic room ! Here is why I gave it two . There were no problems with assembly except for the fact that there were two straps in the box designed to keep the cover from exceeding 90 degrees when opened . Ok , I see the absolute use for that . The problem in assembling this part if the box ( and I heard no one else mention these straps so perhaps they are new ) is that screwing the into the hole assigned on the lid is practically impossible because of the placement of ridges on the inside of the lid . We could not find a tool to do this ... so we opted for another set of holes directly on top ( obviously meant for a divider if some sort ) . I think that the placement of those screws holes on the top should be rethought.Looks like it 's going to do it 's job .	1
We have a few of these . In different sizes . They go together easily . No idea why the first step is knocking out plastic parts . They could n't do this ? Otherwise assembly takes about 60 seconds . We have several of this size box and some have tops that fit perfectly . Others have tops that are too deep and the lock hole does n't line up . It is weather resistant but not water ( or insect ) proof . Even when perfectly assembled there are small cracks between the pieces that allow small bugs to enter . So not for dog food or anything like that . Stuff inside stays dry . Also , if you use a lock understand that the lock is just aesthetic . A ten year old could pull the sides or back off to gain access .	1
This is as good a storage box for the price as we 've found . It 's sturdy , roomy and looks as if the inside will remain dry ( we keep it out on our patio ) . Assembly was a breeze as the assembly pictures are printed on the outside of the large shipping carton -- if you know your letters , you 're home free.Inserting the lid 's hinge pins into the keepers on the back wall of the box is a snap . As mentioned elsewhere , place the flat part of the tip of a large screwdriver against the pin and smack the tip with a hammer to drive the pin home . Took all of 15 minutes to assemble , including walking out to the garage to find the screwdriver and hammer.We like it so much , we 're thinking of ordering a second box .	1
This Rubbermaid deck box is lightweight plastic . It comes with a hole on the lid to attach a padlock.Assembly was easy . I did n't like having to punch out the tabs with a hammer and flathead screwdriver , but it was n't tremendously difficult . The pieces snapped in like they should . I had to have my husband help me with a few of the screws , because the plastic had indentations for the screws but no holes.I 'd have liked this deck box to be a little bigger ( my fault for not measuring ) . The back and seat cushions for my four chairs did not all fit . In fact , I could only get the back cushions in.It 's a sturdy box . I 'm not sure if it leaks . If it survives the next rain , I 'll try remember to come back to update.______________________UPDATE 11/29/12 : This box still looks new after more than a year . It 's raining today and I checked . The box is dry inside , no leaks .	1
To begin , this thing is HUGE . ( The measurements provided do n't provide a good & # 34 ; picture & # 34 ; of how big it is ) . The assembly is straightforward but strange ( It kind of & # 34 ; snaps & # 34 ; together ) . I have n't had any problems with the thing falling apart , but it seems like it could at any second . I move it around on my patio with things inside and it stays together . If you need some extra storage space for outdoor items , you really wo n't go wrong with this for the price . The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the way the unit is assembled .	1
I go through at least one flag a year on my outdoor pole . I leave it up 24/7 ( lighted at night of course ) . I was paying 30 - 35 dollars for a durable outside flag . I thought I 'd try this one . For the price ( $ 9.00 ) , I got 2 figuring that I could get a year out of 2 . This is actually a nice flag . The stars are embrodered and the colors are good and deep with double stitching . It 's not as heavy as the more expensive ones but it flies better in a lighter breeze . The only problem is that it is NOT made in the US , but what is now ? Too Bad .	1
I finally found a good nylon flag that can withstand the wind and all the outdoor elements . I was completely surprised because the price was so good . The secret needs to get out on this , buy your flags here .	1
When I received my flag and opened it out I was startled at the quality . The embroidered stars really stand out ; I had not realized how much difference they would make . The sewn strips are dramatic and also look great.I 've now had this flag only a few days , but it is definitely one of which any American can be proud . It is a thing of beauty ; you can order it with confidence ! Update 6-19-2010I just got back from carrying this flag to a nearby major street as part of a community effort to pay our respects to a young Marine who had been killed in Afghanistan . The street was lined with flags held by hundreds of my neighbors along with hundreds more who wished to pay their respects to the family as the funeral procession drove down the street.It was an exceedingly touching event to see how many people had taken part in this community effort and cared about his death and the pain and sense of loss the family was feeling . It was a distinct privilege to be able to participate and hold my flag high along with hundreds of my neighbors.It was very encouraging to see how many Americans really care about this nation and the young men who defend it !	1
I am very pleased with this flag . I live in an area where it is very warm in summer , sometimes close to 120 degrees . The other monthscan be real windy , so this flag takes a beating . The first one lasted about 18 months out in the weather day and night . It was still verycolorful and had not lost any of its color but one seam started to tear so I took it down and replaced with another of the same kind .	1
What can I say . It is a fine flag and at the right price.Note to buyers though - to attach to a pole , this flag has two grommets ( one at top and bottom ) and is intended for a flag pole with pulley and rope . However , with a couple of cable ties , it secures nicely to a flag post.We have this on a pole that is mounted to the house at head height and angled upwards . We take the flag in each night .	1
Beautiful American Flag ! The stars are all embroidered and it 's an excellent durable quality for a long outdoor life , sold at a reasonable price : ) .	1
I love flying our country 's flag every day ( weather permitting ) . I always replace my faded flag with a new one every Independence Day and was so glad to see the quality and price of this one . Thank you ! Remember - when disposing of your old flag , give it to a local VFW or Boy Scout troop who will dispose of it honorably .	1
This is a well made flag that can stand up to the weather of the Rocky Mountains and not fade like most cotton flags . Good product and I would recommend others to purchase this product too ...	1
This is a great buy and solid quality . I would strongly recommend it . I have one hanging at both my houses .	1
A well made flag but most importantly and what I like the most is it is made in the USA !	1
Needed to get another hummingbird feeder and this one is perfect . It 's almost like our other one , but is a little bigger and has four ports instead of three . Now we have one in back of the house and one in front . PERFECT ! ! ! ! ! Well almost perfect , we stillhave the mini battles , but at least there is another station for them to fuel up .	1
As a veteran of numerous hummingbird feeder , they tend to have several universals : They are hard to fill without spilling , and they are hard to clean turning into bacterial growing grounds . The Hummzinger 367 solves both of these . It is exceedingly easy to clean and fill . The top opens , and snaps back on . There is a reservoir in the middle to trap any ants that covet the sugary solution , which has eliminated another bane of hummingbird feeder.The most important feature is that the humming birds love it !	1
After trying a bunch of different hummingbird feeders this one is perfection . Easy to clean and fill . Seems unbreakable . So far I have purchased three of these . The bees do n't seem to find it as attractive as the feeders with the little yellow attachments they usually got stuck in . Really love it .	1
I 've used many different types of hummingbird feeders , and it is n't possible to get a better one than this three-portal Aspects model . Hummers fight like mad , so more ports are a waste . Sugar water naturally ferments fast in warm weather , so you do n't need more capacity . The built in ant moat is pretty good against smallish ants , and is a freebie . The plastic construction wo n't break if you drop it on a rock or it blows off . And , it is so easy to rinse and fill.You simply can not buy a better designed or better built hummingbird feeder .	1
Had many styles of feeders . I really like this style . You see the birds at any direction . I have 3 now and am slowly replacing my older style with this type .	1
I switched to this type of feeder after the ones from my previous supplier kept leaking . These seem to be well made and so far the birds are using them . Time will tell as to the life of the plastic .	1
I hung this outside my window and had hummingbirds feeding off it the very next day ( and every day since ) . Very happy with this product .	1
not teh prettiest feeder but it is very functional and birds do love it . It has rubber protectors to keep insects out which is nice and cleans very easy . Only holds about a pint . my birds alternate between this feeder and my other .	1
This hummingbird feeder works like an absolute charm . It is very easy to take apart , clean and fill , and the hummers who visit our yard just love it . In fact , they seem to love it a bit too much - they become territorial and jealous about their feeder ! I 'm going to have to buy a couple more , I think . In any case , it 's a wonderful feeder that your hummers will flock around - and please , for the sake of the hummers , never use red dye in your 4:1 water/sugar mixture - the lid of this feeder is so red that the hummers will not miss it ! UPDATE 7/10/2013 : I 'd like to report that this Hummzinger feeder that I bought in August of 2011 is still going strong . There has been no cracking or damage to the plastic , and the red color of the lid is still just as vibrant . The hook itself has turned darker , but that 's to be expected of some metals when they are exposed to the elements . My process ofcaring for the feeder is simple : I change out the 4:1 water/sugar mixture every four days or so . I wash the feeder with water only , and clean nooks and crannies with Q-tips and a clean artist 's brush with stiff bristles . If there is no visible gunk , I simply rinse it out thoroughly . The nooks that most often need cleaning are the feeder station holes and some corners in the ant moat ( middle ) . The ant moat has a few tubes that prevent overflowing of the moat during rain . I 've noticed that these nooks get gunkier faster when it 's been raining a lot.I put away the feeder for the winter to avoid unnecessary exposure when the hummers are n't here . Before doing so , I soak the inside of the feeder , the ant moat , and the lid in vinegar , which dislodges any gunk with minimal scrubbing . After this , I rinse it many times and put it away in a garage cabinet until the hummers come back.I ended up buying another Hummzinger feeder of a smaller model since this one worked so well . I love these feeders , and the hummers do too !	1
After being disappointed with the complete and utter lack of any bird activity whatsoever with myPerky-Pet 363 Birds and Berries Lantern Feeder , I had low hopes for the Hummzinger 's ability to likewise attract any hummingbirds . To my surprise , today I found a female Anna 's hanging out on branches on the trees on either side of the feeder and , a few minutes later , caught her perched on the Hummzinger and dipping her beak into it . So it does work ! See my picture to see her sitting at it : DAs regards the other stuff , the Hummzinger is pretty much as foolproof as they come . It consists of three basic parts , the trough/bowl area , the lid , and the handle . The bottom trough holds 12 ounces of fluid ( btw , the enclosed instructions tell you the appropriate mixture in case you are n't already aware ) along its outer section . The inner center ( think of them as separated like a donut ) is separated by a thin plastic wall that holds water as an ant guard ( more on that ) . The top , red part snaps onto the trough to hold it secure and , in this model , has four `` flowers '' and perches all around the outer edges . The Hummzinger also comes with nectar guards ; for lack of a better word they are essentially little plastic nipples with holes in the center that fit on the underside of the flowers so that hummingbirds can still feed , but insects can not . Finally , the handle has a hook on the top and can be screwed in and out of the center of the trough . Because this is a potential conduit for ants , the ant guard ensures that any ant that crawls down the handle has to go through the ant guard first to get to the outer rim where the `` nectar '' is ... and subsequently drowns.The Hummzinger is super easy to put together and take apart , and is very easy to clean . Even when it is full of liquid it is not very heavy , so it can easily be hung from small tree branches as I have done in my yard . The instruction manual tells you how to put it together , where to place it , how to clean it , how to make nectar , etc . It is as foolproof as they come , and if you want to attract any nearby hummingbirds to your yard , look no further.Note : the instructions that come with the feeder tell you to mix one cup of sugar to four cups of water . Unless you want to store all of that in your fridge , that 's way too much . This feeder has a capacity for 12 fluid oz . I typically brew up a mixture of 1/4 cup of sugar to one cup of water , which comes out to 8 fluid oz . by the time it 's cool . Keep that in mind when you go to cook up your nectar solution .	1
This aerator is fairly easy to use , but does need some muscle power ( to lift it out of the soil ) if you have a really compacted soil . It does help to thoroughly water the lawn ( or wait till after a rain ) before you use this product . The spikes are 3 inches long . The aerator seems to be fairly sturdy and is holding up well so far .	1
This is exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted . The unit is sturdy and well built . It is extremely easy to use on my lawn ( I have somewhat loamy soils , and we 've had rain within the past two weeks , so conditions are admittedly ideal ) . Just step on the step plate to insert the spikes straight down into the soil and pull up on the padded handles . If you 're going to be at it for a long time , wear gloves . If you have a sprinkler system , be sure you know where the sprinkler heads are before you start.By using this device to aerate a small portion of the lawn at a time , I will get the whole yard done by springtime without ever having to spend more than a few minutes at a time . I am looking forward to seeing if any get any visible improvement in the yard.In response to a few other reviews , it 's hard for me to imagine how the tines could be broken off without great effort . Perhaps those reviewers have especially rocky soil or are using the tool in an inadvisable manner ? I also do n't see how this tool could possibly exacerbate soil compaction . It makes little holes a few inches deep and a few inches apart . That will allow oxygen , water , and lawn amendments to move downward into the soil , and open up space for roots to grow . The core aerators might be marginally better ( mainly because they make a bigger hole ) , but I fully expect the spike aerator will improve conditions in very much the same manner ( while making twice as many holes with each insertion ) , and this unit received better reviews for durability .	1
I just received this item a couple of days ago and used it for the first time this morning . It appears to be well-made , and I 've found it easy to use . My soil is very compacted and required that I use it `` a step at a time '' sometimes alternating each foot . Where the soil was softer I was able to insert the tines in multiple areas before taking a step forward , which made me able to cover more area . It is a slow process so I am doing small sections at a time . A larger , mechanical aerator would be nicer and quicker , but for this money this little Yard Butler suits my needs . I realize that getting my lawn back up to standard is a work in progress and will take time . I will update review after I 've watered and treated the lawn , but for now I consider this a useful tool . Best to use after a light rain .	1
I just used this after thatching my lawn of all the dead roots and grass . After cleaning the soil , I watered the lawn . Only then did I use this aerator . Very simple to use . Just put your foot inside and step on the ground , and put your weight on it . I walked around my lawn with this . It was not back breaking work.It did not compact your soil as others have mentioned . If you watered the soil , and the soil is wet , it will put holes through the soil then pull up some soil . It loosened up my top soil . I then proceded to plant the grass seeds . After 1 week , grass has started growing and evenly too . My lawn is starting to look good , nice and green.I highly recommend this . Actually , the reason I bought this is because my neighbor has one , and he used it on his lawn . His lawn looks great , so I just followed his lead .	1
Beautifully made , from the finish on the metal to the welds -- perfect ! All around ! I owned a lesser version of this kind of aerator tool once upon a time , and this Yard Butler aerator puts the old lesser version to shame ! Every detail of this thing , from the design of the spikes to the handle has obviously been carefully and thoroughly thought out . I can not imagine how you could improve upon this design . I want to call this a Cadillac but I 'm not sure that Cadillacs are that well-made any more . This thing is PERFECT . Aerating your lawn is a big deal . Definitely worth the effort ! This would make a very nice Father 's Day gift .	1
CA is under severe drought this year . Several neighborhood cities have enforced water usage restrictions already . I am cutting down the frequency of watering to my lawn . And I am using this aerator to improves water usage efficiency for my lawn as it helps water to go deeper into the soil through the holes on the ground.Though this aerator is sturdy and it 's easy to use , however , it 's a manual process . So , I think this aerator is more for a small area . To cover a large area , I think power aerator is a better choice .	1
I have a hard clay yard , many areas of it the lawn is growing well but there are a few patches where grass just wo n't grow . If you look at the ground it 's just solid dirt , compacted so much that grass wo n't grow , in many cases water does n't even seep into it . I had the chance to try this aerator out and at first I was n't sure . It did n't have hollow teeth like others I had seen but it still works well . What I found is I wet the area a little bit and then started to poke this in the ground , step on it to push it in then pulled it out . Repeated about a hundred times as I walked around and that seems to have loosened the soil up . It 's too early to tell if grass will grow , but there is better airflow and now at least water is draining better and going into the ground . I have planted grass seed as well so only time will tell.I did not have any issues with this bending or feeling like it would bend in my hard clay soil . Seems to be built really well .	1
Yard Butler IM-7C Spike Aerator does a great job of aerating your yard and garden . The thick heavy duty spikes dig into the soil well , and the step guard over the top allows for evenly applied pressure with your foot . The spikes are very sturdy and there 's no need to worry about them bending while you work . The handle is sturdy as well , offering a grip cover that helps keep a sturdy hold upon the tool while you 're using it.If you 've got an area that needs deep , aggressive aeration , this is the tool for you !	1
Manually aerating a large lawn with this would obviously be a lot of work and I would recommend renting a power aerator to do the job . In a smaller yard though or just to do a smaller or hard to reach area then this is what you need . This aerator was easy to use in my lawn and worked well for my needs . I will still be renting the power aerator to do the majority of my lawn , but this will be used to do the & # 34 ; details & # 34 ; . I would recommend this to anyone that has a smaller lawn or a lawn that has spot which may be hard to aerate with a power aerator .	1
This is a solidly built garden tool . From the spikes to the handle , it is one piece , so even in the toughest of soils , you do n't have to worry about the spikes separating . The handle provides a solid grip that is covered in a plasticky/rubbery material that wo n't twist or turn , but stays in place while being used.We might as well live in two different towns , so different is the ground soil in our front and back yards . This aerator was easy to use in front yard , which is fairly plush and well hydrated . But , more importantly , it was just as easy to use in the dry , hard dirt/lawn of the back yard.We 've used a rotary cultivator in the past , and you 'd think that the rotary action would make it easier and more useful . You 'd be wrong , as it actually required more work to make sure that we actually broke through the surface of the lawn . This spike aerator might require more time , but it 's definitely worth it for a product that , in the long run , is easier to use .	1
Aerating takes a lo tof work , and my house is a new construction which means a lot of tough clay/dirt beneath the surface of my grass . I 've spiked down on a lot of stones while aerating the yard , and this aerator held up wonderfully . It 's dirty now but otherwise looks like it did right out of the package . After a lot of aerating and many grass seeds later , my yard is slowly looking more lush .	1
this is a great tool for small areas - flower bed , maybe . But do n't expect to do your entire yard with it unless you 're ready for a real workout !	1
This aerator did a great job for a 7 ' x 25 ' yard . I 'm a newbie on maintaining lawns so I found out aerating is ideal for dead patches of grass that are compacted . I 've read many articles , blogs and seen videos on how to get that `` golf course '' lawn look and aerating was one of the key factors when you have hadr soil . Although my lawn ( Tall Fescue ) is n't `` golf course '' grade , yet , it does look a lot better than it did a year ago while hiring a lawn company to take care of it . Since firing them my lawn has looked so much better.My lawn had dead patches due to rain water constantly running down certain paths over the years after each rain fall which caused the lawn in those areas to be compacted . I used this on my lawn and it pulled up the plugs very easily . This was done on dry lawn so I 'm sure it 'll be even easier on wet soil as others have mentioned . I cored about 8 inches apart throughout my entire lawn . I then raked the plugs of dirt back into the lawn to break them up and keep the nutrients in the lawn . If not , it 'll look like a group of Geese dropped turd all over the place . After raking , I applied the mineral Ironite with a drop spreader and lightly watered the lawn.While using the aerator , I applied even downward pressure and made sure not to go in on an angle to avoid any damage to the unit . Since there are so many negative reviews on the poor construction of this unit I was careful when applying pressure . It feels like a strong piece of equipment and it definitely held up to hard compacted areas . At one point a rock became stuck within one of the cores and I noticed no dirt coming up through it . I used a screwdriver and a hammer to dislodge the rock and it worked without issues . Make sure you wear gloves ! After I completed the work , I had a blister in my palm from constantly grabbing the handle to help push and keep the unit straight but it was well worth it in the end . I 'm happy with this unit and I 'm already seeing results after a couple of days . My lawn will look even better within a week . Going forward , I will aerate every year but not as vigourous to help nutrients , water , oxygen and fertilizer reach the roots in the Spring . Word of advice , cut your lawn high ( 3 - 4 '' ) . It 'll help retain moisture , help keep weeds out and look greener/healthier . I highly recommend this unit .	1
Our backyard is a bald-patched embarrassment . I have tried several times ( unsuccessfully ) to reseed , overseed -- pretty much everything short of actually having the whole thing ripped out and rototilled ( if it were my lawn , and not my landlady 's , I would ) . Because the dirt is so hard-packed and resists absorbing water , I got it in my head that aeration was the key . ( My neighbor the gardener has a big machine , but I wanted to do this myself . I 'm frugal like that . ) I looked at several models and types at the local home stores , and finally decided to order this one . ( In the interim , I ordered and tried theClean Air Distributing FLA1K20 Lawn Aerating Shoes . Let 's call that an assistive device . I like the concept , at least . ) As soon as the Yard Butler arrived we went out back and started poking holes in the ground . ( Following the advice of other reviewers , I was careful about how I put pressure on the handle . In the harder areas , I found that a gentle back-and-forth or circular wiggle aided full insertion . ) I was amazed at how incredibly dry the expelled plugs were . The Yard Butler and I covered the whole yard sparingly and then watered judiciously . The next day the task was easier and the plugs were somewhat moist . The next day it was even easier . I also used it in the flower beds to increase drainage around my trees and shrubs.Before I put it away , I knocked out the dirt , filed down the cutting edges and sprayed some lubricant on the tines . Once I 've achieved a nice , tight pattern across the whole yard , I 'll fill the holes with sand and overseed again with Bermuda . ( Every other grass type dies off and Bermuda just keeps coming back , so why fight it ? I did plant someWhite Dutch Cloverto add nitrogen , attract bees , and say , `` Take that , Bermuda ! `` ) So far , I am very happy with this aerator . If one day I have a decent-looking lawn , I 'll be even happier with it . And I will thank the Yard Butler by giving him his freedom .	1
The purpose of a lawn aerator is to treat dried , brown or troubled lawn areas in order for air , water , and fertilizer to reach and nourish the grass roots . I 've used the Hound Dog brand of aerator for years with good results and was eager to give this Yard Butler brand a try.Likes : *Coring aerators punches out a soil & # 34 ; plug & # 34 ; which is better than spike aerators that just pushes/compacts soil around the holes . *Simple to use , just step on the lower bar to aerate the soil and push out the plugs . Logic dictates that placing the aerating tubes perpendicular to the lawn will result in less effort and plugs cleanly punched out . *T-handle for a good grip when lifting up the aerator . *Newer design with beveled , smaller diameter lower section of aerator tubes resulted in less plugs stuck inside.What I 've learned over the years of aerating lawns : *Only need to aerate dry , brown , troubled spots , NOT the entire lawn . *The soil need to be just right : Too damp , DO N'T need aerating , and the plugs will get stuck . Too dry , aerating tubes ca n't punch through and the cutting edges are dulled . The solid needs to be just damp enough for the aerating tubes to punch through and cleanly push out the plugs . *The old Hound Dog aerator just has an unbreakable U-shaped handle , unlike the Yard Butler aerator which has a welded T-handle . I 'm extra careful not to push down on the handle , and just lift the handle gently during removal from the soil . *Some damp plugs will get stuck occasionally , just push it out by stepping on some slightly damp soil . I would n't use a screwdriver to pry out the plugs because that may roughen up the inner surfaces of the aerating tubes and cause more plugs to get stuck . *Just get a tube or stick that 's slightly smaller in diameter than the aerating tubes and punch out the stuck plugs . *Be careful not to bend or distort the cutting edges will lead to more stuck plugs.Overall : Good for treating sections of troubled , brown , dried lawn . For major , large lawn aerating , hire a pro or rent out a power tiller/aerator .	1
My lawn is in pretty good shape but there are some areas under trees where the lawn suffers a bit . I usually have my lawn aerated because of the size of the lawn for $ 30 . But I like this tool for breaking up the ground in spots where I need to plant new seed in bare spots . I also like it for use in garden areas and other places where the large aeration machine ca n't reach . I definitely can not recommend this product for use on a regular size yard , even if you want the workout . It clogs a little too often .	1
Tried this guy for the first time yesterday to aid some compacted areas in my lawn that my landscaper informed me about . This aerator works great , and it 's really easy to operate . The coring tubes did get plugged up a bit , but I solved that with hosing them out . The height of the handles is really good ( for me , anyways , I 'm 5'3 ) , and pushing the corer into the lawn is easy . If there 's resistance , just put more of your weight onto the foot that 's in the stirrup . If it still wo n't go , it 's probably a tree root or a rock , which I discovered after a few bouts of unsavory words , thinking the aerator was n't working . It was working fine , it was just a case of me being stupid .	1
I bought one of those heavy garden hose that Costco sells ( grey colored and made in USA ) and if you know what I am talking about , you know those things are heavy . I use this in my garage and it keeps the hose organized and tucked away in the corner . I was not sure if it will take the weight , but it is very sturdy and I am going to buy one more for the backyard .	1
The weight and gauge of the metal used in this hanger are vastly superior to any hanger I 've purchased in the past . Most only have one mounting hole , this one has two and that keeps it from tipping out and/or bending during use . The paint coating almost seems like it 's powder-coated and that 's a big plus in my book . The color is very nice too , goes very well with my outdoor areas and the color of the house.The biggest feature for me is the fact that the retaining loop of steel on the front is high enough for the amount of hose I use and I do n't have to worry about the hose falling off once I string a few of them together . This is a great feature in my estimation.The only drawback I can see to this hanger is that there were no screws sent with it . While most people would have some sitting around somewhere in a garage , there could be an instance or two that the buyer would have to make a special trip to the hardware store to buy a few.For the price , I doubt you will find a better hose hanger .	1
I was looking for a no-frills hose caddy . This caddy fits the bill at a reasonable price . This is a metal no-frills hose caddy . I noticed that some reviewers mentioned that in their experience this caddy rusts . So when I received the caddy I closely examined its finish . I see why it rusts prematurely : the finish has many imperfections and bare spots . I am attaching a collage of 4 photos ( they can be viewed by following customer photos link under the main photo ) outlining several areas of defective finish . I painted the caddy with a clear coat acrylic paint before using to keep it rust free longer . The caddy came without mounting hardware . On the positive side it is very sturdy.Here are the dimensions of the caddy : It has 10 inches spanIt is 5.5 inches wide3.25 inches from base to railOverall the design , sturdiness and price were what I was looking for . But I deducted a star for poor finish which required me to paint it before use.Ali Julia review	1
When the wheel works you do n't always need to reinvent it to have a nice product . That 's the concept that Yard Butler did here.With this hose mount you get solid construction , heavy weight design , but something practical that will hold up and last.Very easy to install two screws and you 're done , though the screws are not included which is n't a big deal . I like the extra height on the front bar as it allows for more hose to be stored . I have zero complaints about this , solid and well made . Not sure what else you can ask for with this .	1
Great price , works fine , looks good . Not much you can say . For the price , it works fine . No bells & whistles , just a simple metal hose hanger !	1
Painted it yesterday , green on a grey house ? , used two capcons with washers and it 's far better than the plastic one that was there . 50 ' of hose is handled very easy and I would guess 100 feet would fit . Very strong with good heavy welds . Should last a lifetime unless abused .	1
How well this device holds up depends on what kind of surface it is attached to . It can be drilled into adobe or other wall surfacing like wood . It should hold a 50 ' hose with no problem , or a longer electrical cord . It 's quite simple and made to keep a garden hose or cord from laying on the ground and being an obstacle . How effective it is depends on how high off the ground it is and how secure it is mounted . It does not come with any screws .	1
I actually have five of these things . I have one near each of our outside faucets coming out of our house ( four ) and I have one hanging in one of my sheds where I keep my gardening stuff and some of my beloved junk . These garden hose hangers meet my needs perfectly . They are : Metal and extremely strong for what they are . They are not plastic so there is no danger of their turning brittle and cracking from exposure to the sun and are much stronger than plastic.They are simple and unobtrusive . I am not a person who likes a lot of fancy yard ornaments . These blend in quite well with their surroundings.For what you get , they are quite cost effective . They cost less than some of the plastic gizmos I find.They are easy to install.They hold up to 100 feet of standard yard hose ... even more if you want to push it.They do the job for which I bought them for , i.e . keeping my garden hoses organized , out of the way and safe from my lawn tractor . ( I have a long history of shredding hoses as I do much daydreaming while mowing - I sort of go into a Zen like trance and am pretty oblivious to what ever happens to be in my way . ) Now there is a couple of concerns you might consider ... nothing is perfect you know . These include : They do NOT come with the screws required to mount them . For me this was actually a good thing . In another of my sheds - my `` work shop '' I have something like thirty or so large coffee cans filled with screws , bolts , nuts , washers and things I now not what are . I was able to sift through these cans and find just the screws I needed . I was then able to tell my wife , `` See , I told you this ` stuff ' would someday be useful and I am NOT a hoarder . '' I have been collecting this stuff for over 50 years now and it is gratifying each time I find a practical use for it . It is precious to me.These are metal . Rather heavy metal I grant you , but never the less metal . Metal in prone to rust . I get around this my inspecting these thing every now and than and if I see any rust starting ( normally where the paint has chipped ) , I simply hit it with a bit of sand paper and then spray paint it with a quality outdoor paint.I have mine mounted on 4x4s which I have placed in the ground and on the wall near the faucets . In the shed , I have them screwed to a stud.I do have one of those large box type hose holders that allow you to roll the hose up which I keep near an outside faucet we have near the garden . It must be replaced this year because last fall our 92 year old neighbor lady decided she wanted to burn her leaves in a 300 mile an hour wind ( that is an exaggeration of course ) and the fire got away from her ( Duh ) and took out half my orchard along with the hose box , hose and a leaf raker I used it on the back of my lawn tractor . I was just grateful that it did not take out the barns , sheds and indeed , house.Anyway , this is a good hose hanger and actually a very good buy at the price listed here . I paid about five dollars more at the local hardware . Not frills here ... just a good practical and well built item.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
We have this at the back of our house and it looks really nice . We decided to mount it to a mailbox post , instead of directly to the house , which I highly recommend . It looks like the post came with it . It 's obviously easy to use , the hose does n't fall off , and of course with two screw holes it was easy to install . As other reviewers have noted it does not come with hardware - which was no biggie.The hanger does have a textured finish , which I like . I did n't notice any spots that would be prone to rust , but when it was installed some of the paint got scraped and that small area has begun to rust . So I would say if it 's outside , be careful not to scratch it .	1
Good product . The sole reason I 'm giving 4 not 5 stars is the lack of screws , I had my own laying around but if I did n't it would have been annoying .	1
This hose rack is very simple and straight-forward . It is plenty sturdy , and will serve your needs . I recommend making sure you lag the screws into a wall stud .	1
At last ! A nice , heavy hose hanger which looks good , and is capable of holding a lot of weight ! I was skeptical when I bought it , but the reviews steered me back to this one . I am very pleased with it , and plan to buy two more quickly . I have a heavy 3/4 inch x 120 foot hose which will require two hangers near each other . The hanger will accept a # 12 or similar size round head screw in order to anchor it to a wall stud- ( not supplied with hanger- two required ) . This hanger is a gorilla , capable of holding much weight without bending . I strongly recommend it . Certainly more substantial than most other light gauge hangers seen in the stores , and at a decent price , too .	1
I was looking for something small and unobtrusive to hang the coil of garden hose on instead of letting it sit on the ground , and this serves its purpose well . I have it attached to a fence rail and it 's been sturdy and has n't bent from yanking the hose off.The only thing I 'm critical of is the eyes for the mounting screws - this is n't really something you 're going to remove occasionally , so you really do n't need the kind that has space for the screw head to fit through because if your screws are n't tight enough , it 's going to pop off when you give it any kind of vertical lift while trying to pull the hose off .	1
We mounted this on a wooden fence near the garden . I combined it with one of those & # 34 ; expanding hoses & # 34 ; . Works great . Appears built to last . Extremely thick powder-coated metal is really nice too . Not fancy , but really durable .	1
This is one fine hunk of metal . Sturdy . The paint or whatever is both attractive and seems durable so far . Maybe I & # 8217 ; ll update this review in a decade when this unit has had a chance to weather.The amazing thing is that I can be so happy about something so simple . So much of the stuff I buy seems designed to break . This is n't . I should make an entry in my will for it because it & # 8217 ; ll outlast me.I & # 8217 ; ll be getting more stuff from Yard Butler , as the needs arise , just to see if they make everything this well . It & # 8217 ; s so hard to find quality these days.Other than its sturdiness , there & # 8217 ; s not much to say . It & # 8217 ; s a hose hanger . It works . Did I mention that it & # 8217 ; s sturdy ?	1
They are ok , kind of hard to stup down , but it is ok. Ok , twenty words , what else can I say about this item . I used them a while and they work fine .	1
The handle breaks as did on one of ours after 5 years of hard use , then use Elastic looped thru several times and end knotted . Very comfortable and looking forward to another five years .	1
metal too soft , its all wore out after light use , the thread on front already smooth out.lots rust on the back puller/handle part , need something with better material , rather buy once and be done with it for many year .	-1
I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid ( I 'm 61 ) . We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem . First of all , this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move . If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects , get something else . It has to be moved . You ca n't drag it and you ca n't turn it around and make it go the other direction . I have found I have to check on it as often , if not more often , than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler . First , it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence . Then , it kinked the hose and cut off the water . Finally , it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels . Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water . No kink this time , checked the button on the bottom , could n't get it going again . I went back to my oscillating sprinkler . At least it 's easy to move around . I think you need to use this on a very flat , very straight lawn . Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves . It did n't work for me . I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it were n't so heavy to move .	-1
UPDATE : Originally , I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them ( I bought 3 ) for a while , I 've changed my opinion . Yes , the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses , but Flexogens are still heavy . These Flexogen hoses DO kink , and they kink easily . The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel , lay it flat on the grund , and then turn and turn and turn ( twist/rotate ) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no `` waves '' or loops . I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and , holding the end , walked across my yard . I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling . The hose formed 9 kinks ! What a pain in the hand , elbow and shoulder to straighten it ! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water , this hose becomes unwieldy . The hose turns so that my wand is upside down . It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward -- requires using both hands . Fighting this hose is painful , very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel , the hose twists and turns , causing it to again form waves and loops , which become kinks . Again , you have to twist , rotate , etc . to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground . As you reel it in , you have to stop and repeat the process . My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this . You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses ( 100 ft ) at big box stores and clubs for about $ 25 . Do n't buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands , I needed to replace my heavy , rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight , easier-to-maneuver hoses . I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard . After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses , I chose this hose . I 'm glad I did . While it 's still heavy , it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose . It 's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a `` lightweight '' hose . It is NOT light . It 's substantial . I found a local store that had this hose in 25- , 50- and 75-ft lengths . I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length . I could n't feel much of a difference , so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose ( but lighter than my rubber one ) .This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it 's more flexible . ( I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years . ) I 've only used one ( I bought 3 of these ) for about 1.5 weeks . It 's been too hot , too muggy and too rainy to use it much , but I 'm pleased so far . I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years . The solid brass fittings are thick so they wo n't get dents that cause leaks . Because I have n't dragged it around the yard yet , I can not say whether it really is a `` no-kink '' hose . I recommend this hose because o the quality .	-1
I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee . After a short time , the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement . A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement . Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty ! Now Gilmour is selling them . But it 's the same hose - `` Flexogen '' . The hose itself it actually quite good if you do n't mind replacing the hose ends eventually , I 've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them . Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose . Lifetime warranty is n't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company ( Gilmour ) wo n't honor the warranty . And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate , Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses . I wrote to them multiple times and was told ( without explanation ) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses . If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty , you may not get it.On the Gilmour website , there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced . On Amazon , it does say `` This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee '' . It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package . Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp. , so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement .	-1
I am with a very small number of reviewers here that I have to wonder how this silly thing got that many positive reviews . I have a small backyard , but was constantly attacked by mosquitoes everytime I went out . I have no standing water or what so ever . My neighbors might , but this thing is supposed to cover an whole acre.I followed the instruction , hung it a good distance from the porch and let it go . Oh , I also add the flowtron tape that came with the device to the bottom . A few zaps here and there , but nothing spectacular . I left it on out there for a week , and saw no difference . Still got attacked by mosquitoes . Two weeks , same thing . After a month , I gave up and took it down . There is no point to waste electricity . Oh , it served one purpose : light up that corner of the yard some.So , do n't waste your hard-earned money on this thing and electricity . I am almost sure you will be disappointed . This thing will go on my next trip to Goodwill .	-1
This light is pretty worthless . It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but did n't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population . I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable . The bulbs blew after 1 season . Replacement bulbs are $ 40 each plus shipping . It takes 2 . That is $ 90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $ 80 for the whole unit . Thanks but no thanks.Unfortunately , the only thing I 've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices . They are all unreliable too . Skip the zappers and traps and use deet .	-1
I have my old machine from Sear Lure is not reguire it was heavy . Sorry to get rid of it . The new one was not really working right . hardly kill bug .	-1
This pruner does not even remotely cut 1 & # 34 ; branches , wet or dry . Does not cut 3/4 & # 34 ; branches . It may cut SOME 1/2 & # 34 ; dry branches but at least the one I received was not sharpened and I was forced to return it . Have not decided on a new one yet , since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different .	-1
We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it , because the handles are mounted for lefties . That is , the two hand-grips are each curved to the side , giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it . This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig . But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to `` steer '' the Claw to the left to get them to dig . Since us righties have more strength in our right hands , it was very awkward to `` steer '' the Claw to the left . We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and have n't used it since .	-1
Currently I hate this thing . I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it . I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years . It was better than any mower I 've ever owned . This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like . Pooptastic . I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass , but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well . Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block .	-1
I 'm not sure how I missed that important point , but I did . I do n't see that clearly mentioned from scott 's , either . This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills . It just does n't have the leverage to cut the grass . So I 'm back to the mower . One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces , but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push .	-1
I hate gas powered tools ! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem . Obstacles are a definite problem . The maneuverability is quite limited . With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles . That was n't the biggest problem . A little extra weed whipping to be done . The biggest problem is the quality of the cut . If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great . This mower is for people who LOVE grass . Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day . I hate mowing and grass . I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it does n't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks . Some people coddle their grass . They think of it as a family member . They talk about their grass non-stop . They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour . They have chemicals for weed control , ants , grubs , PH balance , feed . They seed and water regularly . They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns . Their passion for their grass is second only to their family . If this sounds like you , great ! It 's great to have a passion and this mower is for you . If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing . This mower is not for you .	-1
Cuts well , etc . ; but was missing some Nyloc nuts from the hardware baggie so my dad went to the store to get more . After assembly it was fine . But who needs that added hassle ?	-1
I was really looking forward to trying out a reel mower and living a life of maintenance free mowing . It did n't work out . The second time I used it , the grass had gotten a little high , so there was a lot of back and forth action . It took forever , really . I know that this product is n't meant for that , but that was my situation . Anyway , as I was finishing the handle came apart . There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together , and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing . The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.Yeah , I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing , but that should not have happened . I followed the assembly instructions to the letter . It was really a very simple assembly . I did n't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions , though . I was very disappointed with this product.If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL ( like leaving town for a couple weeks ) , this mower may be for you.If you have a sloped , lumpy yard , do not buy this product . Just do n't . It is so hard to use . I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice , flat yard , but as it is this thing was worthless to me .	-1
Couldm't cut my grass very well . Misses some spots because it just did n't cut it . if the grass is taller than 2 inches , this is not mower for you . Need to spend the money and get something that works .	-1

I bought 2 different feeders at the same time and this one is holding up much much better . It is solid and easy to clean . I did n't use the wire that came with the feeder as it was too short . But I threaded a pipe cleaner through the top hole and it works great . The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.EDITING : I am going to have to lower my rating on this . The hummingbird feeder works fine . The issue is the yellow `` bee guards . '' Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow ? So if these `` bee guards '' ( dumb name ... should be called bee attractors ) were any color other than yellow ... like RED ... then I would n't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I ca n't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.one more issue . I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed . We searched the grass below and found 3 of them . There were no gnaw marks , chew marks , bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers . What removed them ? I do n't know . But now that they are gone , the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir . Like I said , this nectar feeder is all but useless and the moment I can actually remove it without getting attacked by flying insects , I will and never put it back up again .	-1
This is difficult to clean .	-1
i guess for the price all you can ask is that it works but barely . hose kinks very easy disrupting water flow and leaks where connected to the spicket , but water does get from point a to point b so i cant give it one star .	-1
I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this . I also read the reviews raving about this hose . Since these hoses are maid from remnants ; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get . My luck was n't good . The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately .	-1
ridiculous pricing on these new Webers ... where once you could get a 22 '' model for less than $ 70 , the company now charges ( and never discounts ) upwards of $ 100 or morehave to agree with other reviewers about : bad quality control - issues with the the charcoal grate not fitting the four-point resting tongues - sloppily sizedpoor material choices - older models had really nice hardwood handles , but the newer models have the molded plastic crapola handles ... loose fit overall - something seems amiss at the factory - models are not assembling with as tight tolerances as in the pastWeber used to be a solid name in the U.S. charcoal grill market - i 'm afraid that this reputation is slipping down a steep slope of obscurity if the QC continues to slidei recommend:1. better quality control2 . standard hinged grates for all models ( you will win big fans ) 3. better tolerances4 . revert to hardwood on handles ( 'handles ' heat better - get it ? ) btw , i use cheap aluminum round cake pans in the ash catcher - works better than an expensive model upgrade to catch and remove waste charcoal	-1
This grill has one major flaw ... ..surprised it is still being sold due to product liability . The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces ... like your deck , your pine straw , or house . For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system . If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires , you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill . I love the way a Weber cooks , but this model is needlessly risky . And if you have one of these grills , take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill . A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes . This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly ... ..it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task . If you value the property you live in , or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence , avoid this flame thrower .	-1
The coons steal the bait from this trap at will . I 've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it would n't engage the trip at first . They advise putting bait past trip plate , but the coons just reach through the mesh and get the bait , another serious design flaw . There are traps that work , this just in NOT one of those . Save your money !	-1
This trap can actually catch mice , but if they are n't small , will only injure them . It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat , who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown . Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it . The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap , then euthanize only the problem animals with ether ( found as `` starting fluid '' in automotive stores ) . Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures . It 's also extremely flammable so take great care .	-1
Yes , these are way easier to open . I have a near phobia about things that snap..especially mouse traps . I can not , physically it is impossible for me to open an old board/metal mouse trap . I know , weird , but it just freaks me out ! So , I got these and was so excited ! We keep our dog food in the garage and pet food draws mice . Every spring/fall we get them in the food or the garage itself . So I tried these traps . Lots of them . I go for total overkill ( pun intended ) when it comes to killing anything lower than my ankles ! Well , these do NOT kill anything . They spent weeks with nothing in them . But the old mouse traps ( my hubby sets them ) had about one every few days . He just reset his and laughed at my 'old lady ' traps . Sigh . I know these look great , and they are super easy to use , but they will not kill anything . I have now read the other reviews and have no idea how anyone could give these a positive review . Also , the thought of having a LIVE mouse to deal with ? What a gross , awful , torturous hassle . No thanks . Hope this helps !	-1
I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap . There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs . As a result , the flea trap is of no use to me . These refills are of no use to me as well and that is why I can give only one star . They cost only $ 5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item . I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option .	-1
I purchased this in May 2011 . One year later and I 'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle . Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months , so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous ... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types . The nozzle worked well in the beginning , though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it would n't last many years . After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop . Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking ... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it .	-1
Bought it in May of 2010 . Did not use it from November to April . That gave it a life span of 7 months before it became uusable . Spend a few dollars more for a one more sturdy .	-1
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick , and at five feet away it 's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick . As a result , it broke on the second day . Amazon replaced with another , which broke due to same issue , but this time was too late to return . I bought another , more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else : ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner	-1
I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush ; NOT ! ! ! ! ! It was worth a try , but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush . I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I 'll give it to my brother . : > ) Note : My rating is strictly for the said application .	-1
I guess this might be ok if you had one VERY SMALL area to trim but it is very tedious and time consuming to use to trim multiple areas . I tried it out but decided to return it . Instead I broke down and purchased a cordless string trimmer ( 18 volt ) which I love and does the job much quicker and easier than this thing could ever hope to do . I wanted it to work for me but no way !	-1
Action works well enough , but the blades only cut if you use the very tips . I expected better from Fiskars because I have several other Fiskars hand tools .	-1
Fiskars badly missed the target on this one . Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though , but in all honesty , this is almost as bad as having nothing at all . Yes , it does work , but not very well . Yes , it 's sharp out of the box , but wo n't stay that way for long . I 'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R & D ; department actually used the finished product . If they did , they 'd realize that it 's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass ( maybe less ) . After that , ergonomics , build quality , and most importantly , fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First , the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath . Second , the steering knob needs to be larger , adjustable , and attach to the pole instead of the top handle . Third , the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there 's too much flex in the existing one . Fourth , the pole should be at least 4 '' longer . Fifth , the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment ( or dispose of plastic altogether ) . Lastly , the blades should at the very least , be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened ! I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face , but here they really took the low-end , budget approach . It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment . The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening , but who here has a living indoor lawn ? I guess we 'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points . I 'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version .	-1
I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly . I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13 : I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house . However , I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand . They are just too large for me . I think the swiveling handle is the culprit . I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks . They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands .	-1
I have been doing yard work for 40 years , so I am no `` backyard rookie '' . This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it . The `` PowerGear '' fell off and could n't be reattached firmly to the pruner . I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say , everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product . Poor products deserve bad reviews , both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered . Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit . That said , I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly .	-1
The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly , BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers . if you 're trimming an outside branch , that 's not a problem , but I 've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.If you choose to buy these , make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you 're going to be muttering to yourself a lot .	-1
I got this for me , but gave it to my wife . I wanted something heavy-duty for cutting vines , etc . in our wooded area , but these work better for gardening / cutting fresh flowers . I was looking for something more `` beefy '' , but this seemed a little delicate for my use . My wife does enjoy this very much for her small garden . It was likely my fault for buying this product for something that it was not intended for ; and it does work very well for what it was designed to do . I liked the rubber tip cover for when you throw it in your pocket . I do wish that you could hang this up on a peg-board , but there 's no opening to do this with , and the blades are heavier than the handle so it would hang tip down . Instead we have to throw it in the `` gardening tool drawer '' where it is slightly more difficult to find.UPDATE : after one season of use , my wife has broken these sheers cutting in the vegetable garden . She admits that the item that was being cut was too big for the sheers , but they should be more durable .	-1
I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy , but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose , the male end just snapped in half . The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap . Yup , it was under normal water pressure but it was n't like I was using the hose as a tow rope , or pumping benzene through it.I 've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years , but never snap in half like that.Next time I 'll listen to that little voice .	-1
The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100 ' hose full of water . The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose . Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year . This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk . I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price . It looks like it will work forever . Also , this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8 '' hose . It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft . If I had it to do all over again , I would have purchased a quality reel the first time .	-1
I 've had this for four years . It leaked from day one . Finally took it down to see if I could fix it . The replacement part from Suncast costs 64 cents but the shipping is $ 9.50 . On a 4 year old item , replacing the part does n't make sense . Since this hose is right next to my front door , I have to have some sort of reel . I 'll look elsewhere .	-1
This would have been a zero star review if I could have done that . Yellowjackets would fly around it but would not enter . After three weeks I tried to return and Amazon did n't even want the POS returned , just gave me a credit . I guess not having to return it is worth one star .	-1
Do n't waste your time or money on this peace of pretty plastic . Using the bait that came with it and the bait refills I bought extra , it never trapped one yellow jacket in an area well populated with the little pests . Save your money and get a good fly swatter and some spray for the nests .	-1
We had hundreds of wasps in our tree so I ordered one of these , followed the instructions and waited for the massacre . NOT ONE DEAD WASP after 3 weeks of use . I changed bait for 3 more weeks , nothing . I changed bait again and still nothing after another month . I half expected the wasps to build a nest around it . Bah , annoying .	-1
I have a time to time yellow jacket problem where I live so I bought a yellow jacket trap and this bate to help with the problem . I followed the instructions and hung it in an area well populated with yellow jackets . I left it there for weeks and it never trapped one yellow jacket . Yesterday I took it down and threw it in the trash . Waste of money .	-1
I 've had this up for a week and it 's got one yellow jacket . I notice that some people recommend apple juice , but the instructions say to just add water.I 'm very disappointed.I added some sugar today and possibly other ingredients in the future to make this more attractive.Their fly catcher is great , but this one works poorly for St. Louis yellow jackets .	-1
I know the difference between yellow jackets , honey bees , bumble bees , paper wasps , and bald faced hornets . It was yellow jackets that were harassing my hummingbirds at the feeder . With the originally supplied attractant I caught no yellow jackets in this trap . With Dr. Pepper I caught one in a week . Another bait might have worked better but the Rescue reusable trap with apple juice worked somewhat so I stopped using the one-time use trap .	-1
I am guessing the 'attractant ' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES , and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds ( thousands ? ) of flies inside the bag . It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK . It 's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross , a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse ! Find a different solution .	-1
I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal . Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted . In my case , in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster . The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds , they do n't die . Even the young ones . I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house , but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch . I 'll post later about customer service .	-1
This is well made and sturdy but I just do n't find myself using it because it 's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you 're carrying tools as well . Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store . It 's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I do n't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that 's more of a chore . It just does n't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft .	-1
Update and downgrade . I 'm downgrading this to two stars because the birds simply do n't like it . I 've had it up or a long time now and it is surrounded by four other feeders that all do a brisk business . This feeder has the same seed and yet the birds try it once and then ignore it . I 'm convinced the seed is simply too difficult to extract and so the bird give up . There are much better feeders on the market and I would start with any feeder from Droll Yankee such asDroll Yankees YF Flipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder . Updated on 1/24/2014.I have a large `` feeder station '' outside of a picture window in my den and over the years I 've tried a lot of feeder designs -- some just because I was looking for the best made and best designed feeders and some because I wanted to defeat squirrels . I 'm in Connecticut and there are lots of gray squirrels here and they are amazingly clever ( and funny ) when it comes to getting food from a bird feeder . And they are determined little creatures . I finally found a method to keep squirrels out of my feeders 100 % of the time , and I 'll get to that at the end of this review . But I 'm still willing to try new ideas and it would be fun to find a feeder that solves the squirrel issue all on its own . I 'm not sure that this feeder does that , but time will tell.This is a larger feeder than I thought it was going to be-and that 's a pleasant surprise . It also seems pretty well made , but I have some doubts about some of its construction features . Here are some pros & cons : Pros : *The dome on top and the lid look as though they 'll keep the food dry from rain or snow entering through the top of the feeder . Wet food can grow mold and that is very dangerous to birds . *As I said it 's a large-capacity feeder and holds three pounds of seed . That 's pretty substantial , so I like that feature . *It was simple to assemble , all that you really have to do is attach the lid at the top of the tube and then put the hanging loop ( using a small nut ) on the dome . Took less than two minutes to assemble everything . Unlike the Droll Yankee feeders that I use , the perches were already installed and that saves time . On many of the Droll Yankee feeders you have to tap them through holes in the plastic tube and that requires freezing the posts ( to shrink them ) and that 's a pain . *Overall it seems very well made , but with a bird feeder it often takes months and some severe weather to find its flaws -- so I 'll update this review in a month or so.Cons : *First and foremost , I am not crazy about the way the base tilts down . The idea is that the squirrel will fall off ( from its own weight tilting the base ) but it appears to me that a squirrel could catch its paw in the feeding station opening if the base starts to tilt after he 's on the feeder . I 'm not completely sure that that 's a possibility , but I was able to get my finger caught ( gently ) between the moving base and the stationery feeding tray . I certainly do n't want to look out and see a squirrel hanging by its paw . Again , the risk may be pretty low , but the way this is designed , the feeding perches are attached to a collar ( that has holes through which the birds feed off of an interior tray ) and that 's what moves . It 's easier to understand once you have the feeder in front of you . *Also , I prefer a feeder that has a catch tray underneath to catch the spilled seed . Instead , this tray has openings in the base so that food that falls off of the internal feeding tray falls out through slots in the bottom of the feeder ( again , much easier to see when you have the feed in front of you ) . The problem with food falling on the ground is that it brings rats and mice . When there is a catch try , the food gets eaten by the birds . *The tube seems a bit too flexible to me . The way that you mount the lid , for example , is to squeeze it a bit and slide in two prongs on the lid ( the lid , not the dome , they are two separate things ) . It seems to me like the prongs could have been a tiny bit longer to keep it attached more securely -- and also , every time you grab the tube , you squeeze it and the lid can pop off . Not a major flaw , it 's minor , but it 's an issue . The Droll Yankee feeders have a lid that slides up and down , you do n't have to remove it and it fits very securely . I 'm not sure if the plastic tube on a Yankee feeder is thicker or not , they may be exactly the same.You might think that from the cons that I do n't like this feeder , but that 's not quite true . I am willing to keep it up for a while and see how it works , both in keeping squirrels away and in just feeding the birds . If I do n't see squirrels hanging by their paws or find a lot of food on the ground , I 'll be satisfied . As I said , I like the capacity and I think overall the feeder is made of quality materials . I just have some issues with design choices that had to be made in order to facilitate that tilting base . I will raise my review to four or five stars if the feeder proves itself . I really want to like this feeder partly because I like the capacity so much.OK , I said that I figured out how to keep squirrels off of your feeders and I have . I went to a bird feeding store and I bought a sort of kit that consists of a pole ( plus a simple insert for putting the pole in the ground securely -- it works beautifully ) and a baffle that goes around the pole . Squirrels can only jump about 4 ' off the ground maximum -- and I can verify that from years of playing with the height of the baffle . So if you place the baffle on the pole at 4 ' or so and IF there are no nearby trees or fences for them to jump from , they simply ca n't get up the pole . I have a three-pronged hanger at the top of the feeder and I have three feeders on it : sunflower , suet and thistle . It works : in five years , not a single squirrel has reached the promised land.I do n't have this Perky-Pet feeder on that pole though because I want to see if it defeats the squirrels on its own . So I just hung it on a 4 ' pole ( a shepherd 's hook ) so that the base of the feeder is within the squirrel 's jumping range . It 's only been out a few days and the squirrels have n't discovered it yet , but they will -- and soon . I 'll try to keep a video camera handy and I 'll post a short video of my experiment if I catch a squirrel in action.I love squirrels , I find them very interesting -- but I would much rather just watch birds without that extra havoc . I 'll post an update shortly .	-1
When I received this product , the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer . They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder . The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware . Since I received this as part of the Vine program , I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.We gerryrigged the baffler , but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious . So far after 2 weeks no birds . It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.Why the one star ? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging . Not worth the time and money . Buy something for less money . A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to . We have six feeders and no squirrels . Now deer are another thing altogether !	-1
Issues with the feeder : -the nut that is to secure the top hook to the cover is tiny in size and ill fitted to the size of the hook . It was impossible to secure it , and thus the top wobbles a bit.-tube plastic , part holding the seeds , is a bit thin . It has to be squeezed slightly in order for the 2 prongs that hold the top on to be inserted , which gives me concern it will not hold up well in windy conditions.-seeds ( 1/4 to 1/2 cup ) fall out of the bottom when filling the container and/or anytime the feeder is set on a solid surface.-bottom portion wiggles around the tube , seems way to loose , maybe that is why so many seeds fall out.-It does hold a lot of seeds , but the rather flimsy construction and materials gives me pause for concern . Especially considering the entire thing is held together by 2 tiny prongs , one in each side of the tube top.observation : -only very small birds have room to land on the tiny perches-the holes to feed from are very small , and there is a gap between the opening and where the seeds actually are , so again , only a small bird head will fit inside the hole to reach the seeds.Opinion : For the price , currently $ 73 on Amazon , there are better , more sturdy options . I have and currently use several cheaper and better feeders than this one . **Edit Oct 3 , 2013 -- So after only a few weeks , I had to take down the feeder as the bottom was falling out . And changing the rating from 2 stars to 1 .	-1
Simple assembly ( two minutes worth ) is required for this feeder . The tube has two holes in the top into which you insert the metal prongs on the roof ( you can not see this in the stock photos , as it is covered by the squirrel dome ) . I have uploaded a photo of the top . The roof has a 2 inch opening for seed and a bar across it , so that the baffle part can hook onto it . To fill you have two choices , remove the top by slightly squeezing the plastic , the plastic is flexible enough for this , but I am not sure if that is what it was designed for and am afraid that squeezing it may stress it . Or you can try to pour the seed through the opening , which is not easy because the bar across the top tends to deflect the seed . I really do not like this , especially because the tube itself tends to move around when you set it down due the spring loaded bottom designed to keep squirrels out.We have Abert squirrels ( darling but clever things that look like koalas ) . They are acrobatic and determined . They do not seem to be able to access the feeder after a few days ( and they usually do get into them quickly ) but it remains to be seen if they will learn . Birds do not seem to have a problem.This feeder is not worth the current price over seventy dollars . The metal parts are a lot nicer than most birdfeeders , and the bottom works well but I feel that the design of the top is really lacking . I am concerned about all the weight on the small prongs that stick out and filling it is a pain . The plastic part is also not much better than my 20 dollar feeder . Filling it so annoying , that I can not recommend it at all . I have a couple of the Perky Pet 102 Squirrel Resistant feeders , ( you can get three of those , with some money left over for the price of this one ) that have multiple ports ( which birds like ) and which are MUCH easier to fill . Squirrels can get a bit of food from them , but they do have to work a bit for it . Try one of those first if squirrels are a pest . I am going to use the baffle ( which is very nice powder coated metal ) for my one of my other Perky Pet feeders . If the baffle were sold separately , I would buy some more of those .	-1
All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct . The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed . On the feeder I received , the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there 's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it 's stuck to a window . Once it 's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill , and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups . Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it 's not worth paying the postage to send it back . Despite the much higher cost , I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects .	-1
This arrived on the 19th and I started using it the last week of Feb . It is now March 4th and it has stopped working . No , it is not the light bulb , I changing it a few times and still nada . So about 7 - 10 days use and it is broken already . Total waste of money .	-1
The only thing in this that should be there is sugar . The rest is stuff you should n't be adding to your feathered friends diet . This stuff is also three times the price of baker 's sugar from any old grocery store , four times the price of regular granulated sugar that takes a little longer to dissolve . This is a bad buy , bad for the birds and bad for your pocket .	-1
I picked up some of this mix last summer at a local agricultural center . It 's an old brand that is easy to find , and the price was right . My first outing with it last summer was a total bust . I mean I mixed the stuff , put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees . If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it , they were obviously disappointed for they never came back . Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it . At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late . I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north , ( the ruby throated ) . It 's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you . But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on . I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing . ( I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper , but just not worth the mess and trouble to me . Just my opinion , but its stands ) . I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon . Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand , I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth . I love it . It 's definitely a little pricier than this mix , but well worth it , trust me . I do n't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills , but I do n't really care . I found something that 's reasonably priced , easy to use , and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it . In conclusion , I do n't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers . Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc . My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it . It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here , but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me , and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season . I have left a link to the Mills brand , and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work ... Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet , 3-Pack	-1
There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix . There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds . This is reason enough to not buy this product . Buy a product without the dye.Better yet , just buy sugar . Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar . Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved . You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird 's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food . Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION . DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey , use only sugar . Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds . Sugar Only !	-1
Hummingbirds are wonderful . They 're amazing , unique birds , but you do n't need to buy anything expensive to draw them to your yard.If you want a feeder , try this one : Perky-Pet Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feederor something similar . I 've used this type for years and you ca n't beat the fact that it 's glass , and that you can buy new bee guards . ( They get moldy . Do n't bleach ... replace.You can get a good feeder for about ten bucks and it will last for years.As far as food , you can do two things . Plant plants that hummers and butterflies and bees like ; or buy a gallon of distilled water and some quality sugar . You do n't need red dye , and should n't use it . It 's bad for the Hummers.I was going to send a Feeder to my nieces , and when I looked at this product I was appalled to find that Perky Pet is still producing such a formula . Their bad.It 's cheap to have hummingbirds . And easy to make your own hummer-chow . Do n't buy this .	-1
I love Perky-Pet feeders , but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this . They do not need artificial anything , especially food coloring ! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil , and 1 part white sugar , let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool . If you are too lazy to do this , you should n't be feeding hummers . It only takes a few minutes , and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks . Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar , and small insects .	-1

Big and floppy , When you tighten them it feels like you cut off the blood or they fall down off the knees .	-1
I wore these twice and they skinned the ... . out of my knees . Yes , I had the straps adjusted correctly . Wo n't use them again . Use a kneeling pad instead ! The kneeling pad has worked beautifully ! No more skinning my knees .	-1
This does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself . The chemical is toxic to touch per the package warnings and it 's not easy to get the cartidges into the light as instructed . Save your money ... .not worth the hassel .	-1
Using these in Japan . I have used them previously in Canada . They were sent to me by family since I would n't have purchased them again . In my case at least , Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate ... at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night . It was the same back in Canada , at least the kill rate was n't any better with the cartridges . The other down side to these ( if they do have any effect ) is that it 's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind . If the mosquitos ' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great ... if not , then what ? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these ... I would just hang another zapper . I 'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective .	-1
I bought three of these to keep a local skunk out of our lawn before he/she manages to dig out all the grass.The PIR sensors inside the scarecrow barely detect a skunk - it 's too low and slow to set it off unless its within a few feet of the sensor . However , the sensors do a great job of picking me up to 20 ' away . When an object is close , the water wo n't hit it , even on minimum range settings . What few drops are hitting the skunk , he/she simply shrugs off and keeps digging / eating.This 'scarecrow ' works better repelling squirrels since they seem to set it off more easily ( hopping through the grass ) and because they seem to mind the water more.I like how the sprinkler head can be adjusted for range and scope of rotation ( 360 degree vs. a smaller sector , etc. ) . That allows you , within limits , to fine tune the area of coverage . The smaller the area of coverage , the more effective the scarecrow is , since the pest will be hit repeatedly as the stream whisks back and forth in a narrow arc . But that only works for alleys or other narrow confined approaches , not a open field.Another nice feature is how you can daisy-chain these scarecrows . The bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap . They even include sealing rings , so there is no leakage . However , I am not impressed with everything being made of plastic . The thing is fragile , as emphasized in the manual - no pushing , pulling , etc . on anything plastic other than the stake and then only around the garden hose fittings . For example , I accidentally dragged a hose across the top of one unit and the plastic distance dial popped right off.For $ 50+ I expect better and its claimed efficacy re : skunks is not borne out in my experience .	-1
This looks like a well built sprinkler . It seems to work for a lot of people , but it did not work for me . The motion sensing was unreliable even at its most sensitive level . The squirrels were undeterred and they continue to plague my garden .	-1
I was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death ( literally ) . He ate three to complete stumps in two days and was working on his next one when I got this in the mail.I anxiously set it up and learned much about it in the process . I see most of the people here praising it for getting rid of deer , and it may work well for that because they are large targets . It also does disturb smaller varmints but not in the way I expected.Thie product is very difficult to review because while it works somewhat , a 60 dollar product is not necessary for smaller , less intelligent and less numerous pests . It is probably great for an area infested with pests though , hundreds of deer or tons of groundhogs , but something much simpler could be used in your average garden setting.The idea of the product is cute and simple enough . It is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler . If the Scarecrow sees anything that moves , it fires the sprinkler off for about five seconds . It then waits 8 seconds and repeats.The problem is that with smaller varmints , they can hide behind the plants , and when the Scarecrow is aimed low , every plant movement ( breeze blowing a cucumber leaf ) sets it off unless you turn the sensitivity down so far that it wo n't go even off with you dancing in front of it.When set to scare away smaller pests , this device falses constantly on plant movement and only sees the varmints if they are totally exposed in front of it , which rarely happens in my garden jungle . The motion sensor concept does n't work well because everything moves in the garden including the plants . It has a false detector that suppoesdly automatically shuts down the sensitivity if it is falsing too much . It does n't work well . We have watched the Scarecrow go off every 10 seconds for an hour non-stop with nothing in front of it but plants moving in a very light breeze.The good thing , and the dichotomy for me , is it appeared to get rid of the pest . We have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing OK . So for that , I wanted to give it a much better rating than I otherwise would . The sprinkler does appear to scare away most animals , but it cost me $ 60 to save $ 10 worth of cabbage.Cats , dogs , groundhogs , squirrels , rabbits , etc . appear to be driven away by it . And the battery has lasted several weeks . I just ca n't give it anything but one star because it does n't work the way it claims and is very expensive for the average Joe . The device works more like a random sprinkler shooting water at random time intervals depending on the breeze.A better product , and one that is actually affordable , would be one you set up that randomly fires a sprinkler every few minutes . It would be much cheaper and just as effective . You may be able to recreate it with a timing device that runs on a battery and a $ 7.00 sprinkler , or just a generic timed sprinkler you use when you notice a pest is bugging your plants . But if you have tons of deer , then this may be your only viable solution short of a major fence or wall.There is another reason the product is very annoying . You have to have it hooked up to the hose all the time . I have to have a hose reeled out across my lawn at all times to reach the garden from the water faucet on my house . It is in the way much of the time , so has to be moved about all the time for family gatherings , lawn mowing , kids want to play in yard etc . But I did discover an alternate use ! ! Kids love running in front of the Scarecrow . : - ) OK , now would you pay $ 60 to entertain your kids ? OK , so sell it as that . Much more useful for that purpose.If marketed as a garden tool , the motion sensor should possibly be a heat sensor or something that can discern better between mammalian presence and a leaf in the wind . The sprinkler is little more than a cheap lawn sprinkler attachment . I am very torn in my rating because here is a device that basically did what I wanted it to do , scared away a varmint eating my plants . It has a major cool factor and is a fun conversation piece loved by the kids . But it falses constantly and is difficult to deal with unless you want to run an underground hose to it and it is expensive.I am giving it one star because it works , kind of , but it is not what it advertises itself to be . A motion sensor can not work in a dense garden for small animals.BUT YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT ! This would get 5 stars as a kids ' toy ! ! So maybe as a combinational use product it gets more stars ?	-1
I added teflon to the water connections , and still leaked but the sensor would not work with the water on . Dry test worked fine i would hear the click . But once I added the water and did nothing . My home is a 1990s house with great water pressure and this device was just terrible . I also tried the havahart water auto sprinkler and both are great in theory but are terrible on real conditions .	-1
Im 6'2 '' and this thing is tiny . I always have to hunch over . I wish i bought a longer weed eater . Also i wish it was more powerful .	-1
This works pretty well for wasps but is useless for houseflies - either that or I 'm just inept . I could n't catch the flies to buzz them . I 'm pretty sure they were mocking me as I tried . For us , this does n't not replace the old fashioned fly swatter - which I had to go out to the hardware store and buy . This product does seem useful for larger , stinging sorts of insects and might replace chemical bug spray products .	-1
I do n't own these but saw them at a flea market . No question in my mind why they were up for sale ( but should have gone in the trash IMO ! ) My friend discovered -- the hard way ! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin ! Mind you , this friend is a large manly guy , not easily affected , yet he howled and dropped it ! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here ! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices , nor my father with his pacemaker , or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen . What were they thinking ! ? ! ? ! ?	-1
This is the cheapest made product I 've ever owned . To insert the 2 batteries , there is no flap that you open . You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver , then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor . Insert the batteries , put circuit board and switches back in , insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut ( 3 each ) , hoping the screw does n't fall out while you 're holding the nut . Are you kidding ? I 'm returning this , because I do n't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries . I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries , you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle .	-1
I bought this product along with composter ( compost wizard jr. 7 cubic foot compost tumbler ) . First , I examined the box trying to find ingredients , none of them was listed , so who knows what it is . It made me feel uncomfortable , because I do not know if it is there natural ingredient or some kind of chemical . Also , I would like to do some research on this product if it really works or not , but since there is no disclosure of ingredients , you stuck to `` take their word for it '' . Plus , what if you have an allergy for it , but since their no information what inside ; it can be a simple dust as far as I know.Second , I followed the directions and added this mystery chemical into my compost . I do not think it made a difference at all . My composter does its job with or without it just fine , it is black and generates a lot of heat , I water it or add greens to keep it moist , and turn it weekly . Did not feel any speed up whatsoever . Nature and composter do what they supposed to do without this gimmick . Do n't waste your money ! ! .To speed up the composting and introduce viable bacteria , I added ( as book on composting recommended ) about a gallon of already made compost which already contains all the necessary bacteria and organisms , so they can start working on new pile of compost .	-1
The saw has good and bad qualities ... PROS.1 . Price is comparable to other brands..2 . The height of the pole is adequate..3 . Home Depot sells replacement chains ... CONS.1 . Balance is an issue . It gets pretty heavy balancing an electric saw on a long pole..2 . Poor design causes wood debris to quickly accumulate in the gear area . As a result , wood chips need to be removed between uses . Failure to do this will cause the chain to slip off or damage the nylon sprocket that moves the chain..3 . Chain guide bends when the chain is tightened . As a result , an accurate cut is almost impossible..4 . The tightening screw comes off very easily due to vibration during usage . After losing it , the only way to tighten the chain is to unscrew the two bolts holding the metal chain guide , move it forward , and retighten the two bolts with one hand while maintaining pressure on the other..5 . The unit is underpowered . Eight amps is not enough for cutting large branches..6 . It is very cheaply made . For example , the chain guide is thin . As a result , it bends to the side . Second , the gears and sprocket are made of plastic or nylon and will wear away in short time . Third , the oil reserve is a small squeeze bottle that is useless . It does not hold enough oil and needs constant refills .	-1
I have had this pole saw for three years and have used the pole attachment once or twice a year for the first two years . During the second year , the trigger mechanism broke and did in the pole section , and the whole thing has been sitting for over a year waiting for me to jury rig up a toggle switch in place of the broken trigger.I am about to get back into this process and that is the reason I was looking up a replacement when the Amazon `` you purchased this item in 2007 '' notice came up ( I do like this function from Amazon as it saves me from reordering stuff ) Back to the pole saw.I did expect the pole trigger mechanism to last longer than it did and Remington needs to re-visit the design.Added a JPG to product page as you can only add videos to the reviews ? ? ? ? ? ? ? It shows a SPST $ 4.00 switch installed in the place of the plastic piece of junk that comes with the unit and the trigger hole filled in with silicone to stop stuff from getting in to the area.The saw also leaks most of the oil ( chain lube ) out when it is sitting , so put something under it.I have to do a lot of this type of thing these days to make products work : See my other reviews .	-1
Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days , you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill , at a cost of about $ 4 each . Depending on what you pay for the propane , attractant and CO2 cartridges , it sums up to a cost of $ 20 around or more at each tank refill . Since you have to refill the propane tank , replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days , this adds up to an operating cost of over $ 400 per year ! I 'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying .	-1
It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it would n't start . I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring , including wasting three of the `` clean out '' cartridges and it still does n't work . Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose . Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line : avoid this product .	-1
This product is a waste of money . It will only last for one season and its ' effetiveness was minimal . Two other folks on the street bought one as well and had the same experience . After mine stopped working ( the first time ) , customer service was marginal at best . I live in the south and I got a little desperate to solve the misquito problem . Save your money and buy more cans of bugs spray .	-1
One of the costliest mistakes I ever made was purchasing this device ( actually two of them ! ) to control mosquitoes in the yard . Yes , it caught mosquitoes , but it did not eliminate the problem ; the yard was still a mosquito zone despite two operating machines . The problem was that while the machine does catch mosquitoes , it does not catch enough of them to make a serious dent in the overall population . It was not until I sprayed the yard with Cutter Bug-Free BackyardCutter Bug Free Backyard 32 oz Ready-to-Spray Hose End Insect Repellent Concentrate HG-61067 , that I finally got rid of the mosquitoes.I did not like this product for many reasons : it had a high initial cost , it required replacing the Octenol attractant ( more $ $ ) , and the propane tank needed refilling about every 3-4 weeks ( more $ $ ) . In addition , it needs an electrical cord plug-in nearby , and one has to replace the mosquito catch nets ( more $ $ ) . Basically , it costs too much to operate , takes too much on-going maintenence time and effort , and most importantly , it did not eliminate the pesky mosquitoes ! So now I have two of these things taking up space in my shed . I will not sell the devices because they simply do not work to control mosquitoes . They will be future landfill items.Save your hard-earned dollars and avoid this product and its clones . Use the Cutter Bug-Free Backyard spray instead.konedog	-1
Expensive hunk of junk . Orig . purchase date Nov. 2006 , after the first one we 'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended . The 'head ' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice . If you get a replacement head from them , there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date ( even though they sent you a new one ! ) . Save your money for something else . Ours is dead again . We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon , but we 're done with the Defender-we 're throwing it away .	-1
I bought these last fall thinking they 'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way . I do n't remember using them at all last year ; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together . They stay open about an inch and a half ! There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk . Too bad , the other Fiskar products we have are great . They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board .	-1
I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with ! We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you do n't care about nature and other living beings ! Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this , but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you can not throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison ! Terrible product !	-1
After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests , none of these test results could be trusted.1 . Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon : pH read `` 6 '' ... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more ( pH of nearly 2 is lemon , so these tests give unreliably `` alkaline '' results ) . The purified water test also came out `` alkaline '' . All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result , 7.5.2 . Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions : none of the K , P , or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes , 20 , 30 ... or even 24 hours later . Manure compost should at least read `` adequate '' for nitrogen ! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either , so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So , all in all , it was a tremendous waste of money and time .	-1
This is a nice sturdy product but it does n't work well on my deck railing . I have a board railing with slats , rather than a thick beam , and the unit just falls off if bumped . When I move it so it sets against the slat it does n't lie flat on the top.I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail , but it 's not supposed to need that . If you plan to order these , get just one first , and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias .	-1
No way does this product perform as promised . And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work ! I do n't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck . At the top of the rail , one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat . Any which way we tried it , it did not hold , would not grip the railing and kept falling forward . The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing . How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing ? Only if you assemble it OFF the railing ; then you ca n't get it ON the railing . ( I think I got all the parts : I received the basket , two L-shaped arms , six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts . )	-1
I bought this simply because of the reputation Havahart has . The other Havahart traps I own , like the 1025 , is of top quality and made to last a lifetime . When comparing the two , it 's as though they were n't even built by the same company . This model is simply a joke . The sides are so uneven I had to bend them in so that the doors would close without leaving a gaping escape hole . I also had to bend the hatch bars because they would not fall into the fasteners when the hatch was triggered . I did catch one mouse , but without my straightening of the unit it would not have even been functional . ( Note to owners ... you really need to read the instructions on how to adjust the sensitivity before you say it does n't work . ) That makes this unit NOT ready to use right out of the box.Other notes ... There is no handle so you must be careful how you handle it so you do n't get bit by the rodent . The top corners are also razor sharp and you need to be careful not to get stabbed . The corners should have been rounded off for the extra $ .10 in cost.It is important to note that all traps must be cleaned with with bleach and then soap after a catch . The urine and feces detracts other animals since they consider the trap `` marked '' . Based on that point , it is also important to know that cleaning this unit is painful as the windows are unfinished and act as a cheese grader on your hands . Once again , a few pennies should have been spent to finish off the rough edgesHavahart 's build quality with this model is pretty disgraceful . I wish the company would have thought twice before they permitted this cost-cutting AND let their quality control go down the drain .	-1
I have a couple of the larger Havahart traps and swear by them . Those are solid , well-built , and foolproof . This model is exactly the same as their larger 2-door trap , just shrunk down . Unfortunately , everything fits together very loosely , which makes it tricky to set the trap , and much too easy to trip . The `` U '' -shaped bars which lock the doors down have a tendency to fall out . The long bars attached to the doors , which hook to the trigger , also fit very loosely . Setting the bars onto the trigger involves taking two cylindrical pieces of metal , about the size and shape of the point of a ball-point pen , and balancing one on top of the other . This is trickier than it should be , and the slightest jar will trigger the trap . It helps if you take a large pliers , or set of channel locks , and flatten the ends a bit so they will stay mated better . A strong wind can set this off , and a storm certainly will , making these unsuitable for outdoor use . Note also that a man-size hand wo n't fit inside this trap , so you will have to carefully toss the bait in and hope it lands on the trigger , or keep trying until it does . There is no handle , so you need to be careful about where you hold a filled trap to avoid getting bit . You can make these work inside , but be prepared for some aggravation . Overall a disappointing product .	-1
Not what I expected . This is to be added in sitting water . My mistake . I thought it was a dry type of killer feed .	-1
For every soil sample I tested this powder with , it indicated it was 7.5 ph . I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5 , which is the highest the meter will go so I 'm assuming it 's just bad powder . I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester ( also bought on here , good stuff ) , and it showed the real PH values ( 5.0 for my peat mix ) , 6.5 for my other regular soil . So it gets to keep a star because I 'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester .	-1
I have a few B & D ; 18volt tools and I decided to buy a weed whacker and this electric broom . I was in for a surprise.The weed whacker works great and the battery lasts for ever ... as an FYI ! I charged the battery the day I received it ... a full charge of about 18 hours..to be on the safe side . Put the battery in and went on to do my cleaning around the deck etc ... . Yes there was air ... it was OK..but not enough to sweep much . 15 minutes later it went to half power , and 10 minutes later it DIED.My first reaction - the battery is bad , lets try a different one and if that is the case I can call B & D ; for a warranty replacement . NOT the case ... all batteries in this thing died in less then 30 minutes and thus this is useless for me.Other B & D ; 18volt tools , including the weed whacker work for 45 minutes plus and usually have full power for the first 30 minutes.Sorry B & D ; but this is useless , IMHO . 1/5	-1
Plastic bag with a few metal rings . Within a few weeks the metal had pushed through the plastic edges so water would just run out the sides . The metal also started to rust and the whole thing looks as classy as a bag of trash hanging on a hook . If this was free , you would still not want it . Get a pot and a tomato cage . ; )	-1
I ordered three of the Topsy Turvy Upside-down Tomato Planters last spring for the summer of 2006 , thinking it would be great for saving space in my small garden area . I ordered it and had my husband install hooks on our south-facing back patio . When they arrived , I inserted the plants just as described and filled them with the best possible bagged soil I could find . Not only did they not grow any better than the traditional ground method , but it was too heavy for me to lift up to the hooks . My husband ( operates heavy equipment for a living and very strong ) even had difficulty doing the lifting once they were filled with soil , both when they were installed and then again when they were taken down in October , with our first frost . If you are not strong enough to lift 50-100 lbs , do n't purchase . Considering the trouble I had with this product , I would not purchase this item again , and would recommend that if you have any disabilities as I have or are elderly , try the traditional method . I 'm thinking about having my husband build me some small raised beds about 2 feet off the ground !	-1
Now im a green thumbaholic when it comes to trying anything new in the gardening world . I love the feeling i get when i literally cant wait to open the box and try it out and see the results ... Nothing was different when it comes to this topsy turvy . I bought two for my mom and one for myself to test different varieties of tomatoes . Well to make it short , the harvest was embarrassing . I had a crimson cushion in both mine and my mothers plus one in a 1 gallon and one in a 3 gallon pot for the ultimate test of durability , watering , nutes , and overall yield per plant . Well the 3 gallon performed the best , giving me way more than 5 pounds of tomatoes easily every couple weeks . The topsy turvey even underperformed the 1 gallon and thats hard to do . These crimson cushions are HUGE and PLUMP , almost as big but not as dense as a beefsteak and in the T.T . they looked like cherry tomatoes , the color was , flavor was missing , and most of all the beauty of the plant just wasnt there . Great idea gone bad since this a path off of vertical growing . Vertical can get you 10 x the yield of any ordinary plant in any size container , but this is not as good of an idea as originally thought up . Hope this helps , stick to nature and dig a hole , dont have one than buy a 3 gallon pot and reap the benefits . One love my friends	-1
I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success . I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die . Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer . I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help . I will not buy these again .	-1
I am a Master Gardener , which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours . We ca n't teach old wive 's tales , just scientifically proven plant info ( but some of the old wive 's tales have been proven , so they are O.K . : - ) ) . These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness . They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants . I am giving two stars for the novelty factor , but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down	-1
This thing really makes no sense at all . I was given one of these as a gift , so I used it . But I also grow tomatoes in a garden every year , so I will use that for my pro/con comparison after using the Topsy Turvy this past summer.Cons:1 . Costs more than a whole bunch of seedling tomato plants.2 . Needs potting soil which adds to the cost.3 . Must water EVERY day or the tomato plant drys out very quickly.4 . Does n't produce nearly as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground ( or in a big pot ) .5 . Not reusable as the `` bag '' became brittle and falls apart after a summer in the sun.Pros:1 . Takes up very little space as long as you have a place to hang it ( note : it must be a sunny place ) .2 . Seems built well enough not to break easily ( at least for one summer 's use ) .3 . You do n't have to `` stake '' the plant so the vines do n't break . Hanging upside-down , the vines are fine.4 . Plants growing upside-down are interesting to look at.But really , this thing makes no sense . Why plant something upside-down ? You could plant your tomato plant right-side-up in this thing and you would probably be better off , and you would not be bothered with the extra effort involved in planting it upside-down . In fact , you could buy any decent-sized hanging basket and plant a tomato plant in it and let the vines tumble over the side of the pot and have nearly the same thing . Or just buy a big pot if you have a place on the ground to put it ( but staking the vines would be better then ) . But , it does n't have to be upside down . The upside-down concept is just a gimmick to get you to buy this thing instead of a regular hanging basket.Since I have this thing and a place to hang it , I would have probably used it again , excepting for the fact that the plastic `` bag '' becomes brittle and falls apart when you touch it after a season in the sun . So you wo n't be able to use this year after year as there is no way it would stay together when handled enough to replant another tomato plant in it . They should have used a plastic that is n't destroyed by the sun . So do n't buy this thing with the thought that you can use it season after season.Anyway , the kids look at it strange , so at least it is interesting . But that bit of unusual-ness is its only real value . If you just want tomatoes and do n't care about the upside-down gimmick , there is really no reason to buy this . Just buy any pot or hanging basket and plant your tomato right-side-up.But it does work , and once you plant your tomato you do n't have to stake it up , and it is interesting to some to see a plant growing upside-down , so I give it a rating of two stars even though I find it really is pretty goofy to begin with . And you are not going to get as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground . But thinking about it , if I used my own money to buy it ( instead of receiving it as a gift ) , I would only give it one star . Really , it is a silly thing useful only as a gimmick to grow a tomato plant upside down . If this is your only choice , buying tomatoes at a farmer 's market would probably make more sense .	-1
For starters , there are no instructions . Look at the pictures . There only two screws and they hold the body to the base ... kind of . There 's a door on the front , seems intuitive , but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open . Maybe I 'm slow , but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where . Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit : I just used it and could not dump the ashes . Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab . With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which is n't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing . I really want to love it , but , so far , we 're not doing well .	-1
I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient . After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping , we just felt that it did n't cut it . We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so ( the saving grace was that there were 3 of them , so there was always another one ready to go -- so long as you were using one machine at a time ) . Also , I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes . The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges . The blower blows grass around -- do not even think about using it on leaves . I can not speak for the weedwacker , as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it .	-1
Clearly of quality construction , but far too expensive given options that are available . Mine were stolen from my garage , and I replaced them with a two-piece combo purchased at Costco for $ 19.00 . They come with a life-time replacement guarantee . The $ 19 item cuts just as well as the Felco and is equally comfortable to hold and use .	-1
The travel settings are very difficult to use and it often sticks . It also sprays as much water out the side as forward . The tripod is the only good thing about this sprinkler .	-1
This kneeling cushion was used for the sole purpose of gardening . The foam may be water resistant , but it is not very thick and your knees can feel the sticks underneath it . The foam does not have a protective coating like other kneeling pads I have used , and therefore it takes the shape of whatever it is sitting on ( for instance your knees and sticks below your pad ) . The kneeling pad could be improved for gardening ; therefore , I would not recommend this product for gardening .	-1
I was disappointed since I thought it would be stronger . I still use metal trowel for digging when durability of a tool is needed .	-1
I am not happy with this trowel because it bends when digging in hard/compacted soil . I suppose if you have sandy loam ... you might be good . Not for me .	-1
A baby red squirrel ... well ... .this is his dream buffet ... attaching photos ! I will attach 5 photos as proof ... He 's a cutie and he is very photogenic ! I bought three of these .

I only had to keep this for one day to realize that it had a manufacturing defect which may or may not be evident on others.The cutting blade only has a washer on one side . When you try to cut something as large as 2 & # 34 ; the blade will bend to the sideand cut into the stop . Bad deal . I returned it for a friskas which I am happy with .	-1
The Perky Pet 203 CP is difficult to fill and clean since the only opening is the diameter of a soft drink bottle . Perky Pet makes other models which open on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end . That means that you can use a soapy paper towel ( rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap ) , to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush . This model also lacks and included hook for hanging.I have and far prefer the Perky PetPerky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feederwhich has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean . It comes with a small `` S-Hook '' for hanging , too .	-1
I used Perky Pet feeders for many years and was always satisfied , however they must have changed their quality control people because the ones they sell now are junk . If you just screw the bottle on to the base snugly , they leak , and if you try to tighten them they twist off and have to be discarded . The flowers and the wasp guards do not stay on after a couple of washings and have to be glued on .	-1
Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away . Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked . Since then , the other three started leaking also . Do n't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months , but I am going to try . I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years . Somebody `` improved '' them.Update : I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever . Hav n't received them yet , so I do n't know how these will perform .	-1
The hummingbirds recognize this feeder right away ( better than the saucer kind ) but it started leaking after a couple months . Pretty unreliable .	-1
The only reason I gave this feeder two stars instead of only one is that I like the glass bottle , much nicer than plastic . Even at that , the glass is hard to clean unless you have an overpriced feeder `` mop '' or a flexible bottle brush.Despite the advantage of glass over plastic , this feeder is not even useable . I hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy . It leaks when the wind blows . It leaks when the temperature rises . It leaks just because it feels like leaking . And that attracts ants , armies of tiny , biting ants . I 've tried filling it to almost the top and I 've tried putting just a bit of food in it - does n't matter , it leaks.Even if that were n't a problem , I still would not like this feeder . The plastic bottom and the flowers inserted into it are next to impossible to clean . The flowers have little ridges that cry out to be filled with mold and nasties . A dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all . I think the manufacturer is doing the birds a real disservice by selling something that is likely to end up with dirt and mold , and be bad for the birds.So , this product is for the birds . And very much NOT for the birds , not if you care about them .	-1
Although I have come to the conclusion that where a product is made is no important to me ( it is made in China ) , I am giving this bird-feeder four stars because it is well-made and very attractive . It looks just like a barn on my daughter 's farm . It is red , has a weathervane on top , windows and a metal roof . It is supposed to be a deterrent for squirrels who sit on the bar because they weigh too much . Our backyard squirrels hang upside down on the post and get into anything , but so far they have not been attracted to this feeder . I have the old feeder up in the backyard and the birds loved it . It is just blue and clear plastic- we stopped putting birdseed in it when the new Perky-Pet Country House feeder arrived . It has been up for six-days and today is the first day that I was able to observe a sparrow actually eating seeds from it . Apparently , the birds are taking their sweet time in adjusting to their new source of bird food . We feed our squirrels peanuts I buy by the sack and because we gave a resident feral cat who is blind and old , we also get a possum and very big raccoon coming to our back-door to eat cat food and drink fresh water . This bird-feeder is an attractive addition to our small back yard and I trust that in time our usual back yard birds ( Cardinals , Finches , etc . ) will return . The Mourning Doves eat the seed that falls to the ground and since there has n't been that much activity at the new red feeder , they too are n't visiting us too frequently . I am giving them all time to adjust to their new food source.Well , here is an update : after using this bird house for approximately two months , it has broken . The metal rod that holds the rooster on top ( this secures the top of the opening where seeds are poured into ) has vanished . This morning I found the roof of the birdhouse on the ground and can not find the rest of the pieces anywhere . Perhaps an outraged squirrel or large bird came along and broke it to get at the seeds inside . I now would recommend that you do not buy this bird feeder unless you just want it for decoration .	-1
The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.But it 's flimsier than it looks from the photos . The construction is thin sheet metal , with sharp edges.I do n't know why there are so many positive reviews . It 's a less effective feeder than cheaper options ( i.e. , the birds do n't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic ) , and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed . Meanwhile , the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger ( which is shown in the photos ) , or it has a large shaft through the middle , so you can stick it on a pole.The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top , but it 's also poorly engineered .	-1
I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby . The birds do n't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet .	-1
I have had this unit for seven months , now . It honestly is just a cheap device , turned out cheaply , to cash in on the solar craze now going on . I 'm all for great-quality solar panels that provide reliable energy . This unit does not . Yes , it reads fine on my multimeter , when I check it , but the battery on my RV is not staying charged . I have gone through two charge controllers , so I have to think that the panel just might be the culprit , here . I am in a city with almost 90 % very sunny days . This panel gets full , blazing sun , just about daily , for seven hours . You get what you pay for , and you do n't get much , apparently , at the price this unit goes for . My RV battery performs as it should when it is not hooked up to this unit . It charges and holds charge when I 'm on the road . Again , it looks like a case of a badly made solar panel . Spend more for a better unit .	-1
As a few others have posted , in here , the quality control on this Chinese unit is poor . The wiring on my unit was reversed . Once I set things right , the unit worked correctly for about four months before complete failure . My battery died in the bargain , due to the unit failure that allowed my battery to drain completely with no load on it except this unit and the solar panel . I 'll try one more and then update this review . Update : I just ordered : KINTREX SPC0601 Solar Charge Controller - 7Amp , 100 Watt , ... At just $ 10 , on this site , it 's a far better deal and has an extra indicator light for low charge condition . The connectors should mate up perfectly if the pictures are accurate . As far as the reversed wiring goes , in all electrical applications with connectors , an exposed contact is normally the ground , coming from a power source . The hot side is recessed and/or shielded to keep you from grabbing it and then a grounded object or contact , which would result in a shock . This scheme is reversed , obviously , in the non-powered side of the circuit , ie. , the thing you 're sending the power to that mates with the connection just described . When I called Sunforce 's rep , in Canada , and spoke with him , he denied knowledge of any other incidents of reversed wiring . That 's really curious , as others have posted about the reversals , as I mentioned , above . UPDATE : 4/2011- The Kintrex unit works flawlessly . You are well-advised to go with it and leave the reviewed unit , as above , alone . It costs much more and is inferior .	-1
My first reaction to this product is that it is very expensive for a single unit . But if it works better than the others , perhaps it is worth it . I bought 2 units and plugged them into different locations in the house . After two weeks of testing , they have only caught 2 mosquitoes and 1 small unidentified bug . I have seen fruit flies cruise right past them and there is still a pesky fly buzzing around my house who seems to have no interest in the traps.In addition , the UV light is rather cheaply and flimsily inserted into it 's holder so it moves around and causes a loud buzzing noise which requires you to readjust the light from time to time . The buzzing noise is loud , you will hear it if you are in the same room . Finally , this unit is missing an on/off switch so the ony way to turn it off is to unplug it from the wall and find a place to put it which is ackward because of the sticky tape which slides out very easily and the fragility of the UV tube and the fact that it is not terribly secure in the socket.I realize a good trap is hard to come by and none of them are perfect , it could be that this unit is one of the better ones on the market but at $ 34 a pop , it just does n't strike me as good value for money . At this time , I can not recommend it.I 'm debating if I should give Flowtron a try , the only thing holding me back is that it is not designed for indoor use which is what I require .	-1
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development , metabolism , reproductive activity and many more ( E.g. , see Science Daily `` Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally '' , January 22 , 2013 , or Google for a very long list of other articles . The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and does n't seem to be disputed . ) I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not . I received a reply from Carol that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders . She also said they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder . Let 's encourage them to change that stance ! I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do . Even if one is n't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds , consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations . Furthermore , consider the food chain and the general fact that we 're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic plastics without it . This feeder has many _great_ properties , but it 's not the only feeder with them ; personally I will buy alternatives until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs . I would love to see them do so .	-1
Before ordering , I was afraid of having a cheap plastic bearing inside . No where in the internet , including manufacturer 's web site , I could check the spec on this part , nor anyone of reviewers commented on the type of ball inside . This one does incorporates metal ball bearing , but have a similar characteristics as $ 0.99 plastic part , badly leaking water at the joint . Time wasted to make it function like a simple shut-off valve , in order to save time required on returning , just priceless . Now , I understand why unusually high number of negative feedback on this junk . Over last few years , we have become so acquainted to junk imported from China , it 's just amazing how some users will tolerate badly designed and manufactured pats.I had no idea that designing a water shut-off valve was such a difficult task , that requires a special skill . It 's made to leak , no matter how much connector is tightened . I thought Gilmour was a reputable American manufacturer , and I 'm totally off . Do engineers at Gilmore check the prototype before sending its design to full production , or do marketing people actually check if it 's viable product ? Please do not write reviews without thoroughly checking them first , or post phony reviews your untruthful reviews are wasting other people 's valuable time .	-1
I cooked my seeds with this contraption . The heating pad would be infinitely better if it had temperature control . Though all in all I like that all the components were included .	-1
I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product . The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense . If it was that easy , there would n't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening . But I do n't buy a dedicated germination kit . The standard seeding kits available for $ 3.00 are fine . I have one I like for the windowsill , not because I love the brand or soil it contains , but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL ! ! That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly . The cost is ridiculous and , if you really want to heat your seedlings , then put an electric blanket or throw under them . You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $ 20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket , the seedlings start a bit earlier . And if in a colder area ( basement/attic ) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear . But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area . If you want a smaller area , fold the blanket . Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70 , but your environment may be different . Do n't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate , these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money . If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you ca n't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window , then get a heating blanket and a grow light . Much cheaper in the long run .	-1
This would be a great timer . It is easy to set . Keeps the settings when you change batteries . Resists water . Allows manual override and lets you remove the timer from the valve to program . The big problem that it shares with most of these timers is lack of reliability . Mine stopped working within a week . The company was very easy to deal with and offered to ship a new one next day but I need a timer now or my plants will die so I will return it to Amazon .	-1
So far I 've purchased two of the Orbit 62001 Lawn Timers , but I 've gone through about four of them with Amazon and the local mega-mart . The first 62001 I purchased in 2008 died ( and it was my fault ) when I left it out for a day during a freeze ( note : I live in southern Texas , and by `` freeze '' I meant - it hit 30 for about two hours at night ) . The digital portion worked fine but the actual physical housing which rotated the open-and-close water flow restrictor would simply no longer operate . I replaced this unit with another from Amazon and it worked fine for the following summer . Having learned my lesson , I unhooked the timer for the next winter and left it in a dry , insulated , garage . The garage would hit a low of around 40 versus the outdoor temperature of 30 or less . The garage never hit freezing temperatures and the batteries were out of the unit until the following spring . When spring came , the same problem occurred - the digital portion worked fine , the physical water restrictor would no longer move . I ordered replacement # 3 from Amazon and this time straight out of the clamshell the unit would not work - same exact issue . I returned the unit to Amazon and grabbed a replacement from the local mega mart - again , same exact issue.Now , I should state that I live in an area with hard water and yes I can see that being a possible issue . Perhaps gunking up the the inner-workings of these timers and restricting the mechanics from moving about properly . However with my two `` mostly-broken '' units I 've torn them apart and found no calcium build up on the regulator or even evidence of rust or circuit corrosion ( I am not an engineer but when comparing a working to non-working unit , it all looked the same ) . I should also note that I have aOrbit 62032 Yard Watering Systemin my backyard and it has been working fine for three years running . After multiple tries with the 62001 , I 've stepped down to the slightly less functionally robustOrbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timerin hopes that it might last longer than a year.I 've given these units two stars ( instead of one ) because there is the slightest chance that I simply might have been unlucky with my four units . When these worked , they worked flawlessly day-after-day . Multiple timers and day-to-day nuances made watering during drought restrictions a breeze . I just wish they would last .	-1
This was the third one I purchased as my other two just stopped working after 2 seasons . This one did n't even last this season . not wasting any more money on these things .	-1
Granted , out of the box this API water agitator does n't look like much . Packaged with ( 3 ) metal legs , ( 4 ) rubber anchors and ( 1 ) metal agitator , set up takes seconds . I slapped in two D cell batteries ( not included ) and placed this unit into our bird bath . I like the fact that no wiring is required . It is quiet . The continuous agitation does repel mosquitoes . There is a rubber gasket in place to prevent water seepage into the motor housing . Trust me it does n't work.I 'm not a big fan of the snap in metal legs . The legs have fallen out of their slots on more then one occasion . I get about three months juice before its time to replace the batteries . I add algaecide to aid in keeping the water clear . It must work because I see both birds and butterflies dropping in for a visit . Now the bad news . It did n't even make through the summer . The high price tag on this lemon is another reason to think other options .	-1
I was never able to get this to extend and that was a real pain , especially since I bought it for my wife , who is short and catch reach the top of the van . Also , do n't mistake this for an ice scraper ; it has rounded edges meant to remove snow without scratching the roof of your vehicle .	-1
Bought this about 4 years ago from another site ( much more expensive ) . It worked well.The pole holding it gave out ( wet soil from heavy rain and snow ) , and the feeder hit the ground ( frozen grass ) . It literally smashed into about 10 pieces ; I do n't know if I even found them all.The interesting part of this story is that the thistle feeder hanging on the opposite hook of the pole and 2 poly rain rings ( over the tops ) did NOT break . Only this feeder broke ! ! I suspect that it was either weather-worn , OR an old ( ER ) feeder with limited life to the plastic , OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.A few feet away , I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected ( anchored in cement ) , i.e. , NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame : an animal attack.I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement.FINALLY , they said that an animal probably got at it , but they could n't guess which one . DUH . I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break , AND that the other barn style feeder , only a few feet away , was not touched , basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.Last email from mfgr : Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder ! ? I asked about the lifetime warrantee again.They asked for photos . I sent them.Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken.I wrote that they 'd just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say.Answer : NO REPLACEMENT ; must have been an animal attack ( their words ) .BOTTOM LINE : Forget the lifetime support . They wo n't replace the feeder.Be ware of expecting any type of replacement or support from the company . The emails were almost accusative ; really off-putting , as if to discourage further contact . And I had shown them a photo of the pole AND the other elements on it which did not break . We exchanged probably half a dozen emails.I 'd like this feeder again , but I 'll be d ... .d if I spend money on something which is NOT supported when the mfgr says that it is supported for a lifetime replacement.Whose lifetime ? An ant 's ? Probably made of SHODDY MATERIAL with a limited life is my conclusion.The company will insist that `` some '' animal attacked it , and they do n't support animal attacks . Great excuse ( not ) .	-1
The birds do n't like it at all ... .I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do . I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this . If you do n't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor , and it 's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground . I would have to say that I ca n't see how a squirrel would get to the food ... I will say that about it . But what good is it if the birds do n't get to it either ? I 'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds .	-1
For everyone out there that is an avid bird feeding enthusiast , you are by now well aware that you will spend half your time selecting seed , buying feeders , setting up and tending to them , and the other half battling squirrels for control of them . Squirrel 's are nothing less than amazing in both their tenacity and technique when it comes to getting at the bird seed we desire so desperately to keep them away from . Squirrel baffles of all shapes and design are only effective about half the time at best . And weight sensitive perches are soon made obsolete or at least only partially effective when word gets around as to how to hang down from above and keep your body weight elsewhere . This very expensive squirrel buster is really nothing but a little better design on an old idea . The weight sensitive perch is nothing new . Its been in the arsenal of attack on squirrels for quite a few years now . A weight sensitive perch is only as effective as what 's overhead for the wily squirrel to hang his feet on and drop below . The squirrel buster does just about as good a job at making the top of its feeder pretty near paw proof as I have encountered , but not totally . My neighbor who owns one of these has seen quite a few squirrels attempt to drop from above to the seed below only to slip and fall , ( much to her giggling delight ) . However not a day goes by that some future Olympian worthy fellow somehow manages to lock his feet above securely and feast on the spoils now at his disposal below . Now that she has had it for a few weeks it has become an everyday event that at least a couple of squirrels beat the system . Its my opinion that there is no such thing as a foolproof squirrel busting feeder . This one is close , but at the price their asking for it I do n't consider it a worthwhile investment at all . Take away its design and its no better made than any other feeder costing half its price . It will get just as dirty and is just as hard to clean . Its all up to the individual of course . But its my take that this feeder is extremely overpriced regardless of its promise and performance . If you are interested in a feeder that is every bit as squirrel proof as this one and is about a third the price , try the Backyard Bistro bird feeder available on the web . I own 5 of them and they are made of very tough impenetrable vinyl and aluminum and its shape and hardness makes it just as effective against squirrels as the buster here . You can even buy six of these in a case for the price of two of these feeders , and with free shipping thrown in . Check it out and see for yourself . And happy hunting !	-1
As mentioned in other reviews , this is NOT for cars and trucks . I bought it for use on the riding mower , filling smaller cans and for my dual sport bike . It 's virtually impossible to fill any of these without spilling.But worst of all , it split along the seam at the top and sloshes gas out when carrying and fills it 's storage area with fumes . Forget it !	-1
I have this and several other cans with this new stupid design ( thanks liberals ) due to all the tree hugging environmentalists . You end up spilling more gas with these new cans and need 3 hands to try and use it with some success . These are worse for the environment then the old style which were fine .	-1
I purchased this fuel can because I have a small diesel Kubota Tractor . I needed a five gallon can in order to fill the tractor 's tank . The tank on the tractor is conveniently located on the top of the tractor . I have found it pretty much impossible to fill the tractor with diesel from this can without spilling all over myself , and all over the ground , creating both a safety and environmental problem.The ill conceived idea behind this gas can is that the pour spout is rigid and you have to rest a lever on the pour spout on the rim of the gas tank , pushing up on the lever , and then releasing the flow of gas . This does not work at all . You end up having to manually pull the lever up with your hand . Remember the can is 5 gallons , and it is too heavy to try and support with one hand . So , for this device to even come close to working , you need at least 3 hands , and preferably four . In frustration , you finally take the pour spout off , and pour directly from the can into the tank , which pours diesel all over yourself.Making the device even more useless , it does not have a vent opening anywhere , so even under ideal circumstances , you can not pour from it.One wonders if they even ever tried to use this thing before they sold it.AVOID ! ! !	-1
To call this & # 34 ; spill proof & # 34 ; is ridiculous ! If the can came with a simple screw cap and a separate funnel it would be fine . Instead it comes with a cap that you have to punch out the center to fit the spout , thus rendering the cap useless for sealing the canister , and an incredibly poorly designed spout that just does not work . I ended up ignoring the spout and using a plastic funnel instead . If I can find a replacement cap at least I wo n't have completely wasted 20 bucks . Not recommendedPros : will hold 5 gallons , does have 2 handles , is fairly stableCons : the nozzle is a waste of time , there is no separate cap for storage - the nozzle has to be in place	-1
Update : Stopped working effectively after about 16 hours of use . James on a twig slightly larger than a matchstick and then makes a whining noise and a nice electric burning smell until I whack it with my hand a few times , then it 'll work in a promising manner until you actually bring the blade to bear on a hedge . I 've found that the cutting bar is so flimsy you can bend it permanently without much effort . Might be why its jamming all the time . Might be interesting to try to bend it to a semi circle for custom cutting before I jam it into the garbage can ... No power , fibber marketing guys , impractical for anything other than marginal light duty work here and there . Very first piece of outdoor equipment that I 've bought that just stopped working after a short usage period . Maybe i 've been fortunate. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- original review : I 'll say something good first . Its not the worst hedge trimmer i 've used . ( update : yes it is ) That having been said , the box shows that its ten feet long , and after fiddling with it for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to extend it and reading the manual twice , i came to the conclusion that this includes the height of the person holding it . Love the marketing spin ... The cutting end is a good 7-8 lbs . Try holding that at an angle on the end of the ( actually ) four foor pole for a while . Would have been brilliant to put the motor on the bottom and some kind of actuation through the pole and just the blade on top.The specs say it 'll cut almost a half inch . Not exactly . Anything about a third of an inch or so will stop the blade dead . Now you 've got a heavy cutter on the end of a long pole stuck on a branch . If you 're lucky , you 're also on a ladder.Not worth a hundred bucks .	-1
Too heavy and kink . Hard to carry around . Expensive to much for female gardener . I am not able to drug around to water my flower beds .	-1
These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves . Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal , that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature . Cooking mitts , on the other hand , need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat . They also need to insulate even if they 're wet.I found that this glove , despite being well made and attractive , is no good for holding hot items . At best , it protects hand and arm while grilling , if you 're using tongs , lets say , over a very hot fire . Just do n't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it .	-1
I LOVED this filler & gauge , until I started blowing tires . I had a hunch the low price for this gauge was too good to be true . Although the convenience of the filler/deflator is fantastic , the quality of the gauge itself is horrible . After blowing two tires on one recent trip , I used two other quality gauges to verify the pressure . It turned out that my tires were all over inflated by 15-20 PSI . I filled them cold like I always do ( either in the evening or the morning ) , but they were way over inflated . This had never happened to me before . I have two of these inflators ( one in the garage and one in the RV ) , so I pulled out the other one to double-check the gauge on that one . Compared to my other two high-quality gauges , that one was off by almost 10 PSI too . So I threw both of these in the trash and stopped using them . It 's a shame too , because I loved these things . It 's not worth it if the gauges are n't accurate though .	-1
Written in the blush of new ownership : Let 's be clear , this is not a go into the forest and cut wood for the winter chainsaw . I bought this saw to use as a shop tool for preparation of blanks for woodturning . Having said that , it cuts very well , has sufficient power for the purpose , is not too loud and is well balanced . It is well made for the duty for which it is designed . Several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic . Mine is metal . It looks like it might be pretty light , but it is metal.I expect it to hold up well under the use that I intend for it . I would expect it to hold up for normal home tree maintenance use . I would not expect it to hold up to days of bucking logs.Cold experience : Over the past 10 months or so , I have cut about 10 short log sections into chunks and cut some vertically for bowl blanks . I do n't think this constitutes a lot of use . The painted name on the bar is barely marred . The chain is still quite sharp . Today I was cutting a log vertically which is the easiest cut for a saw as you are cutting with the grain . Chain is nice and sharp , everything is great , except suddenly the motor is running and the chain is still . Fast forward through a lot of diagnostic stuff to learn that the sprocket in the inside of the saw is in fact plastic and has in fact melted . I was looking at the outside sprocket when I said it was metal.My money was completely wasted . This saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated . The best part of the whole thing was when I called Poulan customer service at 3:55 PM Central time and was told that the `` general questions '' section was closed , their hours being from 8:00 to 4:30 Central time . I ca n't speak for customer service but their engineering department is clearly closed.Avoid this purchase .	-1
These are not brass . They are made from cheap pot metal ( recycled mix of aluminums ) covered with a thin brass plating . ( The similar looking Orbit brand is made this way too . ) They will work well for a while , long enough to lure you into writing a great review for them , but they will eventually fuse to the real brass fitting on your hose and your faucet and may not be removable without ruining both your hose and the faucet on your house . Before they get to that state , as the metal deteriorates , they will begin to dribble , so you will be tempted to tighten them further , making later removal impossible without damaging your hose and faucet . Since the metal is aluminum , not brass , the inserted piece will scratch a bit each time you insert it or detach it , and over time this accumulation of wear will cause it to leak at the fitting . The black plastic over the fittings will twist and fail to grab the knurled metal beneath it , so you may have to use a wrench to install . Again , these will work very well for a year or so , and after that you are cuing up for a big problem . Gilmore alleges a guarantee on these , but other reviews have said they do not respond if you call them on it , so your only recourse would be if Amazon would cover it , which is unlikely at the point where these will start giving you trouble . Either way , they are n't going to pay for your ruined hose fitting and faucet.The good news is that there is a better set available on Amazon , also made by Gilmore , and unless they have cheapened the design or materials since I last purchased them , they are far superior : Gilmour 09QCGT 2-Piece Green Thumb Brass Quick Connector Set for Hose	-1
Threads not good and I had to toss it in the junk pile.Saving it for a crooked hose thread where it might workwith a force crank . Be careful . If buying retail look for damaged orimproperly mfg threads .	-1

I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds . I knew instantly this was a mistake , but thought I would give it a try . One lasted only a few days at best . A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground . Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground . The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps , but again , the same thing happened . Food everywhere and a useless feeder . I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience . Sorry to have to give it a one star , but I ca n't find a reason to even go for two .	-1
PLEASE SEE THE UPDATE AFTER THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW.We have been plagued with squirrels for years . Our neighborhood has vast numbers of large oak and pecan trees with a smattering of fruit trees . These provide food and shelter for these little critters so they multiply like crazy and typically overrun the area . They dig up flower beds , destroy container plants , dig holes in the lawn and devour one small bite out of every pecan and piece of fruit before it matures . If that 's not bad enough , they have chewed through the wood trim on our home and made nests in the attic . Squirrels are NOT cute little cartoon critters . They are destructive tree rats . Over the years , I 've tried to keep them at bay by using various home remedy methods -- from putting ground red pepper around plants to using a pellet gun to permanently remove individuals . Nothing worked . They liked hot pepper and for every one I killed , three more would take its place.With this in mind , I was skeptical of `` Deer Off '' . But I was willing to give it a try and I actually think it may be working ... at least for the short term . After spraying a liberal amount of `` Deer Off '' around the base of trees , in flower beds and around container plants , the squirrels seem to be staying away . It 's been a little under two weeks since the initial application of the product and I 've only seen one squirrel at a time in the back yard . In the past , they came in gangs of more than a dozen -- sometimes as many as two dozen at one time . So far so good.The label says `` Deer Off '' deters animals by smell and taste but it is odorless to humans `` once dry '' . I never noticed an odor as I sprayed it and I have a pretty sensitive nose . It 's also supposed to last for months even after rain or watering of plants . I ca n't verify this but I 'm keeping my fingers crossed . If there 's anything I dislike about the product it is the silly battery-powered sprayer container . I 've noticed this trend in lawn care products recently and I do n't like it . Batteries and battery-powered pumps add an unnecessary expense to the products , they add unnecessary complications should electrical components fail and they add unnecessary waste to landfills . It 's not difficult to pump up a sprayer and let air do the work . And , of course , air is free . In my opinion , the advent of battery-powered sprayers is a dumb marketing idea that should be rectified as soon as possible.I 'm giving `` Deer Off '' four stars due to my short term observation that it appears to be working with the local squirrels . Docked one star permanently for the battery-powered sprayer.UPDATE 06/12/2012 : I guess I was too optimistic . The squirrels are back . Digging in the lawn , digging in the flower beds and digging in the plant containers.Yeah , that did n't last too long . No big rains to wash it away either . It just quit working . And at over 30 bucks for the large bottle , I ca n't recommend it as a temporary solution .	-1
Rabbits have been feasting on my new lawn and I was excited to be able to try Deer Off from the Vine program . However , while rabbits are one of the critters it says it repels , I guess rabbits did n't read it . The first try I liberally sprayed it all around the perimeter of the grassy area I was trying to protect . But , judging by the fresh rabbit droppings I found each morning afterwards , I suspected it was n't working . My second try I liberally sprayed everywhere , perimeter and main lawn , and later that night I checked outside and found 2 rabbits feasting away . Maybe they like eggs , but it does n't appear to work on rabbits , at least not the ones I have here in San Diego .	-1
This did n't seem to accomplish a whole lot and I found getting it up and running sort of fussy . Maybe the wildlife in other areas is a little more bothered by it , but here it just ended up being more trouble than it was worth for the amount of actual effect that I felt I was getting .	-1
The instructions for this product are easy to follow and I had it ready to spray , theoretically , within seconds . However the sprayer just would n't spray . I checked and replaced the batteries . I took it apart several times and still could n't get it to work . I read the directions again and noticed a phone number with the pledge that the company 's highest objective was to serve the customer . So I called and got a toy company . They informed me that they had been bought by another company and they did n't have a forwarding number . I got on the internet , located a working number , and finally got to talk to a human being after the usual push button 1 , then 2 , and so on . She said she would be happy to send a replacement product . But I needed to get a specific number off the bottom of the package . I hunted down the package but alas , the number had been defaced . Too bad for me and I was unable to get a replacement.I decided to just sprinkle the product around my flower garden but it did n't have any effect at all . So maybe the liquid needs to be sprayed directly onto the flowers which was impossible to do without the proper sprayer . So basically it was worthless . I 've tried other products from this company that worked . Maybe you will have a different experience .	-1
The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks , not the claimed three months , and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I 've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them . I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard . Two weeks later I 'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well . I like the safety lock just below the sprayer 's trigger . I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved .	-1
it was easy to assemble , it was easy to use and gave a continuous full spray and that 's all it did . The rabbits came last night , and I sprayed it about 8 p.m 3 times with the spray being just inches above the plants to give full coverage . I did that 3 times just to be sure and the plants were fine . 10 1/2 hours later , all the 25 ft. row of collarobi ( sp ) had been eaten down to the ground and the same with the two 25 ft. rows of beets . They even ate the tops off the onions about 5 inches down . It DOES N'T work . All the fancy packaging and the battery powered spray does n't matter if it does n't work and it does n't ... . I have fence around the entire area so rabbits and squirrels are about all that get in , coons and skunk and deer ca n't . Save your money ... ... ... ... . put barbed wire around your garden ... UPDATE : I tried this 3 times and nothing worked about it , including the motor on the sprayer . I had to pour it into another sprayer to use it and YES , I turned it off after spraying and I even put new batteries in it and nothing ... .. The spray handle with the motor for spraying was the only thing that worked in the first place and now even it is useless ...	-1
As a gardener , I 'm familiar with Deer Off . Like most of the smelly deer repellents , it works , but has to be renewed after rainfall.As a codger , I 'm finding hand-held sprayers somewhat of a chore , particularly when spraying the whole garden , so I welcomed the idea of an electric spray gun.Unfortunately , this one does n't work.I read the instructions carefully , shook the container , inserted the feed to the pump and pulled the trigger . Result - not much . The pump whined away for a while , but nothing came out of the nozzle . Eventually , after several minutes , with the batteries starting to show the strain , the pump primed , and a stream of liquid came out . When I adjusted the nozzle to convert the stream to a spray , the result was disappointing - there was n't enough pressure to produce a decent spray . I tried spraying some of my shrubs , but the results were unsatisfactory.As an experiment , I tried cleaning the intake with water , in case it had been blocked . During the process , I found an interesting phenomenon - the pump produced a good spray pattern when handling water , but not the thin sludge that is Deer Off.Bottom line - it does n't work . It might be better with a more powerful pump .	-1
The sprayer works well and it 's so convenient to use . Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it 's absolutely amazing . Not a squirrel since and it does n't hurt the birds . Where has this been all my life ? June 2012 update : The pump only worked the first time and since then I 've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver . Even then , when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry , NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers . I guess anything is better than starving . Ditto with the squirrels . They eat their way through the product to get to the food .	-1
It does n't mention this in the product description ( but does on the bottle ) , but this product is not supposed to be used on edible plants . Well , I 'm a vegetable gardener with a rabbit problem , and if I ca n't spray it on things I 'm going to eat , it 's useless to me . This , despite saying it 's safe for use around kids . Had I known this from the description , I never would have ordered it.It does get one star because my mom uses a product with the same active ingredient on her roses , and it does keep the deer away ( although it stiiiiiinks ) .If I get brave enough to ignore the warning labels and spray it on the kale , I 'll update .	-1
I ordered this product in desperation . The rabbits and squirrels ate most of my garden . I got this product and applied it around the perimeter of my garden area as the label says not to apply directly to plants you plan to eat . 1 day things were good then my peas disappeared . I am very disappointed .	-1
When I saw this offered , I jumped on it . So far the deer had eaten all my lily 's , including my day lily 's and were beginning to start on my tiger lily 's . Add in the echinacea and my beautiful garden was almost gone . As soon as this arrived , I began spraying.Assembly of the unit was easy . Batteries were already installed , so it was simply a matter of unscrewing the cap and placing the siphon hose in the canister and tightening the lid . Unfortunately , the batteries were dead . So a run to the store for new batteries . Try again . The sprayer began spraying when depressing the trigger button . ( Batteries should be packaged separately so they do n't run down , me thinks ) Sprayed the flowers and the area around them . Given the smell of this stuff , I was sure it would work . ( Yes you can smell it and it is vile ) . One caution , do n't spray on a windy day if you have to stand downwind of the sprayer . I could feel the hot pepper working in my nose and mouth.Went inside and waited to see what would happen over night - would the deer be back ? In a word , yes . From the amount of deer dung ( copious amounts ) on the ground around my flower beds , it was more like a herd instead of one or two . As I walked closer , two rabbits jumped from the echinacea and hopped across the yard . All the day lily blossoms were gone , as were the heads of my tiger lily's.Does this stuff work ? In a word , no . Maybe it 's just the wild game around my place , but it seemed to me that Deer Off was more like a salad dressing attracting the animals instead of deterring them .	-1
I sprayed this all around my house to deter ground squirrels . Well first of all , it took a couple of minutes for the pump to prime instead of a couple of seconds . Then , when I was about 3/4 of the way around my foundation the sprayer started to sputter and refused to spray any more even though there was still about 1/4 of a bottle left.And last but not least , the squirrels do n't seem to be the least bit bothered by the smell . Even my dogs do n't seem to be bothered by the smell . In fact , they like to lay down with their noses stuck under the door right where I sprayed the stuff hoping to keep the baby squirrels from squeezing under the door and eating all my dog kibble.Since I live in the burbs , I ca n't judge how effective it is against deer and rabbits but do n't waste your money if you have squirrels . This has absolutely NO effect on the little critters .	-1
I have my garden behind an six foot wire fence . Unfortunately , one side of the fence is only 4 feet tall due to damage last winter . I used this product as well as an electronic aid to keep the deer away . The result was $ 60 in plantings and 40 hours of labor down the drain . It did n't my local animals one bit ! Next year I will raise the fence and perhaps install a moat ! Actually , I have a neighbor who had good results with just playing a radio in the garden . Guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music !	-1
I was excited to try this product out to protect my roses from hungry deer - but I could not get the battery operated sprayer to prime . It seems an overly complicated design for a simple product . Now I will have to pour it into a traditional sprayer to see if it works .	-1
I had high hopes for this product , as deer and squirrels tear my flower and vegetable gardens to shreds . This product works as advertised , flawlessly - BUT it does not repel so-called wild critters . Deer and squirrels initially were frightened by the sprayer action . However , the repellant odor did not deter animals from eventually taking over my entire garden.I talked to a county fish and game official ; he opined that urban animals are too accustomed to man and his many exotic sounds and smells After three days or so , the deer simply ignored the spray of repellant . They are persistent pests that wo n't hide in terror on seeing me . Believe me I am quite scary . I am proceeding to evaluate other tactics.Bambi and his kin are safe for the moment .	-1
Well , I 've tried everything I know to do , and so has my husband , to get the sprayer to spray . The batteries are good and properly inserted , the motor is functioning but nothing will come out . We 've carefully followed the directions on priming , checked for kinks in the hose , turned the blue nozzle to to the `` on '' position and made sure the inlet was deeply immersed in the liquid . Yet , it simply wo n't spray.Since the sprayer wo n't work , my next step is to pour the liquid into a hand sprayer and use the product as directed . So , at this point I do n't know how well the actual repellent repels unwanted animal critters , but the sprayer definitely does n't function as it should . Just thought the potential buyer should be aware of this before purchasing . I will report back on the efficacy of the repellent after I finally get it applied .	-1
Deer Off and I are not doing as well as I hoped due to the smell , drought , batteries , ingredients.The drought and water restrictions have all the varmints in survival mode seeking food , water and shelter . More regularly seen squirrels and rabbits plus formerly unseen creatures ( bobcats , coyotes ) have arrived en masse . So taking a chance on Deer Off was a no brainer to get them to move along . I do n't have a DEER problem so I can not indicate if this works on them.However , it FAILED to repel the squirrels and rabbits and was an unpleasant HUMAN experience due to : - non-working batteries I had to replace , - pungent smelly concoction had me gagging , - ingredients can cause allergic reactions ... READ detailed ingredients BEFORE purchase.Although an application of this deterrent can last up to 3 months , heavy rain and your lawn sprinkler can rinse it away requiring another application of Deer Off . The battery powered sprayer makes for easier application without your trigger finger falling off and their customer service is pleasant and helpful.All in all , I would n't buy this product .	-1
Just like other animal repellants ( and I 've tried many ) , the Havahart repellant ( Havahart also make traps ) fails to deliver.The battery operated sprayer is a toy , so good luck getting it to work reliably.The odor is similar to other products . In fact , you can make your own with rotten egg and hot pepper.But to focus on the core objective : repelling critters -- I did not see any noticeable drop in the amount my flowers and vegetables . Deer , squirrels and rabbits seem minimally discouraged .	-1
I 'm not sure if it 's supposed to be this way , but the Deer Off product I received was the consistency of buttermilk . The package was marked `` ready to use , '' so I know it 's not meant to be diluted . I do n't know what happened , but I do know sometimes stuff like this gets frozen in storage or sitting on a loading dock and changes consistency . Since I received it , it 's been in my garage where the cold-hating cacti spent the winter.The sprayer was firing , but the repellent was too thick to make it through the gun and out . The sprayer seemed to have a lot of power when I sent water through it.If the sprayer worked with the Deer Off , this would be a great product . I ended up `` painting '' some of the leaves of my squash where I noticed the rodent damage yesterday . I 'll report back if they quit nibbling . If it works , I have ornamental plants that the jackrabbits wo n't leave alone that I 'll try it with.The dogs enjoyed the smell of the Deer Off . I really did n't detect any obnoxious odor .	-1
I tried this product and it does appear to be somewhat effective at deterring critters from bothering garden and flower areas for a while . It turns out to not be practical for my needs because of the relatively limited working time , and the relatively large expense of the product . I can not afford to continue to apply this product to garden and flower beds . The area I live in is experiencing a drought so a garden is a particularly attractive feeding ground for animals , so the product might work better in areas where animals are not so stressed to find food .	-1
I was so excited to see this offered through Amazon Vine ! The deer are making their way around our yard and gardens this summer . They tend to come ( and go ) in cycles so this was a perfect opportunity to try this product . Or so I thought.Assembly was a cinch . Batteries included ( and installed ) . All I had to do was take off the cap , put the hose in and tighten the cap . Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when they said you have to hold the trigger/hose down low ( in order for the liquid to reach the nozzle ) ... that 's how siphoning tends to work : ) ~ After just about draining the batteries , the liquid *finally* started coming out . Of course , I had to replace the batteries after I 'd been spraying for about three minutes . Not sure if the batteries are cheap , old , or should just come packaged separately with the spray.Within two days , the deer were back and were snacking on my plants . I had tried spraying it at the base of a shepherd 's hook as well to deter squirrels from getting at the bird feeder . Well that worked like a charm . Not ! This concoction smells quite a bit like vinegar and that 's about all I could smell . If you want something that will work and I mean REALLY , REALLY work , try Liquid Fence . I 've been using this product effectively for about ten years . You can get it in mixed form ( a bit cheaper ) , or in concentrated form ( which is what I buy ) . That is more expensive , initially , but it is well worth the cost . Here 's the link , I hope it works : http : //www.amazon.com/Liquid-Fence-113-Repellent-Concentrate/dp/B000NW777E/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1341177361 & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; =liquid+fenceThis stuff stinks to the ends of the Earth and beyond ! Rotten eggs , vinegar , garlic and tons of other great , stinky stuff to keep the deer away . It does n't work on squirrels though ( I have n't found anything that does ) . And you have to reapply as new growth appears ( deer loooove the tender greens ! ) and/or if it rains or you top-water your plants . Re-applying due to water and growth is essential for this product to work . You WILL smell this when you spray ! Do n't be downwind of it : ) ~ it dries odorless in several hours.I would not recommend Havahart Deer Off . HIGHLY recommend Liquid Fence : )	-1
SEE UPDATE at end for the rating change from 3 star to 2 star.I obtained this item through the Amazon Prime Program . I have a large yard with bird feeders and that attracts a lot of squirrels and rabbits . I have tried chasing them off , but that is almost like swatting at a fly with a tissue . A lot of exercise on your part , entertainment on the critters part , and nothing changes.I thought that since this product is safe to use around animals and did not appear to be a bio hazard that I would give it a try . Here are my thoughts on the product : First , the Sprayer:1 . While the unit comes with batteries ( 4 AA batteries ) , they did not last more than a few minutes . I had to install new batteries to get anything out of the sprayer.2 . The sprayer is supposed to put out a stream and a wide spray . While it will put out a stream , it does not go very far . As for a wide spray , I guess wide is in the eye of the beholder . It is not very wide and it only travels about 3 feet from the sprayer . I good hand pump sprayer that you can re-use for other sprays would work much better ! I have a 1.5 gallon sprayer that is pumped up by hand and it sprays this material 4 times farther and gives a nice fan spray ! I would have to rate the electric sprayer a 0 Star product as it is just not worth using and it comsumes batteries quickly.Second , the Deer Off Product:1 . The product seems to work as the rabbits and squirrels have not been back at the feeders since I used the spray . Of course , it has only been on for two weeks and it has not rained , so I do not know how long it will last . Still , it is working and that is saving my plants and the seed for the birds.2 . Having a premix product is fine , but it is a very expensive way to do anything , especially if you have a large area or if you need to reapply the product after a few weeks.Overall , I would rat the Deer Off product well , but the packaging and the battery powered pump I would not recommend . If you can buy the product as a concentrate , I would recommend it . I gave the product a 3 star rating due to the battery powered pump and the fact that it is a premix.UPDATE : Well , I guess two weeks is about the limit . Just a couple of days after writing the review the rabbits were back . I put the rest of the concentrate I had into a hand sprayer and then sprayed the plants again . That worked until we had a small rain shower pass through and then the rabbits were back.So , I now have to say that for the price this is definately NOT a good solution ! !	-1
The actual fluid may very well be working - it 's hard to tell . My problem is with the motorized sprayer - it 's more trouble than it 's worth . The alkaline AA batteries that came with it were n't producing any spray , so I replaced 'em with rechargeables . This produced a sputtering short-range squirting.I may try John Casey 's fix but honestly , I 'd prefer to just pour the contents into an old squeeze-sprayer and try it that way.As to the fluid 's effectiveness - well , *I* ca n't smell anything , but the DOG can , so he has added his own ingredients to the mix . We 'll see how THAT works out ! .	-1
Dead batteries , hard to push the safety switch to the safe position while keeping the sprayer pointed away from yourself.Fine print on the bottle says do not use on food plants , even though the Amazon page said that the product is recommended for organic gardening . Being OMRI listed and USDA approved for use in organic gardening is in direct contradiction to the instructions on the bottle.I had planned on using this for my cherry tomato plants , but the instructions on the package clearly say do not use on food plants.I did sacrifice one of my tomato plants , since I felt that a test of the spray would n't be complete without a plant that I know the deer love to eat.It was difficult using the sprayer , first was discovering that it had dead batteries , then of course I had to find replacement batteries . Then it took quite a while for the pump to prime . The safety switch is very difficult for me to place in the safe position while pointing the sprayer away from me , it might be easier for other people , as I have some limitations to hand strength.The spray went on ok once I had gotten all the bugs out of the system . It appears to work , but we have had quite a bit of rain , and it is very possible that the deer found somewhere else to munch on plants.Overall a two star item , since I grow mostly food plants , and I think the directions on the package over-ride what it says on the Amazon page	-1
It 's absolutely amazing ! I am an animal whisperer . All I have to do is spray the Deer Off around my landscaping and the critters they come a running . Not only is the salad bar open , but I 'm obviously using a peppery salad dressing that the critters love . Whooo hooo ! Is n't that how it 's supposed to work ?	-1
Upon getting the spray , I had a hard time getting the sprayer to prime up . It took about 5 minutes or so of opening and closing the nozzle and holding my finger on it blocking the spray hole to get it started . Once i did , it was very good . It has an easy adjustable spray tip that goes from an almost mist to stream . There 's just a slight smell from it but its nothing offensive at all , reminded me of yogurt . It has a slight milky color to it which is nice because you can see where you 've sprayed . The main ingredients are egg , capsacian and garlic . Pretty simple ingredients and the label says its harmless to animals and humans . I believe its USDA approved for organic gardens which means it should be safe but one never really knows.I 've only had this a few days and will update in a few weeks but so far , the squirrels are n't attacking by bird feeders . They ca n't resist sunflower seeds which are for the birds not them and climb right up the thin wrought iron plant hangers . I wanted to give this a try because I ca n't spend all day chasing them away . They keep the birds from coming and can go thru the entire feeder in no time flat . You 'll get a batch of squirrels that are very bold so I hope this stuff continues to keep they off the feeders . I do n't care about the grounds but not on the feeders . I sprayed the polls and the feeders , without getting the openings for the seeds . I also sprayed the surrounding grass and plants under and around the feeders.The birds do n't seem effected at all . They eat from the feeders and the grounds under them with no apparent issues . There were a few squirrels but they did n't stick around long . Not sure if it was the spray or that they saw me watching them ... lol . Again , I 'll update this in a few short weeks and give my final thoughts . Keep your fingers crossed ! UPDATE 6-14-12 : No Good , it seemed to work for a few days but now the squirrels are back and climbing up the plant hooks again . I sprayed the hooks and the bird feeders till they were dripping with the spray and it did n't stop them . Oh well ! on to other inventions .	-1
I have a problem with squirrels jumping on my bird feeder and knocking all of the bird seed all over my deck . I sprayed this solution on the outside of the feeder and the deck railing and it seems to have no effect on the squirrels .	-1
I have a bird feeder on top of a 10 ' pole , which I thoroughly soaked the Havahard Deer Off . 5 minutes later a squirrel climbed up the pole through the Deer Off . I chased the squirrel away , and he was back in another 5 minutes . The Deer Off did not even slow him down.What DOES work for me is greasing the pole with automotive grease weekly . I had hoped that I could apply the Deer Off less frequently . I also worry about poisoning the squirrels , since they obviously remove the grease from the pole physically , on their underbellies , and then lick it off .	-1
I was only able to `` spray '' with this for a minute or so . Then the spray turned to a stream which dripped off of everything . I changed the batteries thinking that maybe the batteries that came with it were old , but that did n't help at all , so it 's a mechanical fail.I 'm a person who cares about the environment , and the packaging disturbs me . The holster is plastic and does n't have a recycle number on it , so that will end up in the landfill . The battery powered sprayer does n't either , so the outside of that will end up in the landfill . Even though I 'll see what I can do about recycling the insides , I 'm sure many people wo n't and that will also end up in the landfill . To save the earth I 'd rather buy this in a gallon jug and use my own pressurized tank sprayer than fuss with a battery operated sprayer . Environmental fail.I put this in my own tank sprayer . Even after three applications on my purple coneflowers , the squirrels are still eating the flowerheads . Product fail .	-1
This review reminds me of the old joke about the box of baking soda in the fridge put their to keep away elephants . The rationale is that if there are no elephants in the fridge , it must be working . I like the delivery system on this , it beats the heck out of the squeeze pump . I only saw deer once in my yard and after I sprayed I have n't seen them since . The big `` but '' is that I do n't have empirical evidence that the reason I have n't seen them again is the spray . It is easy to use and I guess it is working but I am hard pressed to offer any proof.addendum 6/8/13 I went to use this again and the battery spray no longer works . I ran it in warm water thinking it may have gotten gummed up but to no avail . So one use it worked , the second use the battery spray failed . I did replace the batteries although it was making noises with the old batteries , I gave that a shot anyway . Still did n't work . Since my primary reason for liking this was the delivery system I have downgraded my review rating .	-1
I have moved into a neighborhood teeming with wildlife : deer , raccoons , rabbits ... As much as I enjoy it , I 'd also like to have some landscaping . After carefully researching deer-resistant plants , I re-landscaped the whole yard with those choices . For additional insurance , I followed all of my neighbors ' advice & bought deer repellent . I chose this one as it specifically includes rabbits in the description of animals repelled by this product whereas the local nurseries could only steer me in the direction of deer resistant plants . I recognize that when animals are hungry they will eat anything but I used this product exactly as directed , we have not had a great deal of rain , & the rabbits & deer have eaten everything in my yard . According to the directions , it still should be working for at least another 6 wks . My neighbor uses a product called Plantskydd , also non-toxic & it really seems to work . It has an odor that would gag a sewer tank repair person but it does air out & still seems to keep the animals away . I would recommend that over Deer Off .	-1
I received this Yard Butler Sprinkler Stand as part of Vine product reviewing . I had read a review of the unit before I ordered it about the threads in the stand being a problem . Yes they are a problem . As I tried to put in the sprinkler that I had just purchased , I was very careful , I found that the sprinkler would not go in straight and the sprinkler end thread was being ruined . I looked at the threads in the Yard Butler and they were clearly not tapped properly . If I would have continued it would have ruined my sprinkler head . It was not a question of lining them up , the Yard butler threads were bad.Since I have the tools and knowledge of threading and tapping pipe , I re-did the Yard butler threads and it accepted the sprinkler and works fine . The problem is that most people who would buy this expect it to work without having to machine the unit to make it right .	-1
I owned an older model of this feeder that lacked the roof , and I was eager to try this version ; it seemed like a perfect upgrade . Unfortunately , I 'm very disappointed in it.First of all , one of the welds on the roof where the posts are inserted is crooked . It was possible to insert the post and use the feeder , but it looks a bit cockeyed . NOT the quality I expect from the Duncraft name ( and price ) .Next , I discovered how inconvenient it is to fill this feeder , not a small consideration for a feeder that holds so little . With the roofless version , I could simply turn it over , shake out the hulls , add fresh seed , and shake it until all the seed was under the grid . That ca n't be done with this one because of the way the roof is attached.The posts are not fastened to the feeder ; the feeder and roof have round holes where the posts just sit . The roof is only balanced on the posts , not fastened , so if you turn over the feeder , posts go flying . The washer that holds down the grid is attached to the hanger , which goes through the roof , so the screw and washer ca n't be removed to lift the grids for filling unless the roof is moved up out of the way . Bottom line : The feeder needs to be partially disassembled and reassembled to refill it . Bare-handed most of the time , as it 's a fiddly process to get it all back together . In the cold and snow . Every couple days.The quality and filling hassles did n't stop my trying to use it , though . What ultimately retired this feeder was that `` Squirrel Blocker '' turned out to be merely a naming convention , not a description of the feeder 's performance . The squirrels quickly figured out that launching themselves onto the feeder from a nearby tree would shake the feeder enough to spill seed handily onto the ground . Soon they observed that this also caused seed to shuffle to one side , piling it high enough to reach into the grid and grab it . Hot on the heels of that breakthrough was the realization that simply sitting on one edge of the feeder tipped it enough to keep the seed piled up for easy access.This could be avoided by placing the feeder where squirrels ca n't jump onto it and using a pole baffle so they ca n't climb up . If you have such a location , would like to add a platform feeder , and have a setup ( e.g. , handy picnic table ) that makes it easy to work with the feeder when filling it , this feeder might fill the bill for you . It 's attractive and sturdy despite its manufacturing defects , and I think it would last a long time.However , any feeder can be pretty well squirrel-proofed by locating it where squirrels can neither jump nor climb onto it . If I had such a location , I would surely use it . Meanwhile , I can only chalk up another victory for the squirrels .	-1
I occasionally get a bird using it to hop to another feeder but I have n't seen any stop to eat . A cardinal sized bird shy away from it . Squirrels , on the other hand , have no problem at all jumping on to it . I believe it was able to eat from it as well . I 'm not sure what to do with it now .	-1
The great reviews swayed me and I got this . I find this no better than a $ 5 or $ 10 sprayer from my local shop . Coupled with the $ 15 delivery charge from Amazon on this , $ 35 is a bit of a joke . The other thing that bothers me about the sprayer is that the spray is not `` instant '' . I press on the button and it takes a half second to actually come out ... also , more annoyingly , when I release the button it takes a good 2 or 3 seconds to stop spraying . This is seriously a pain when trying to do some precision spraying of fertiliser or medication . I 'm also not too impressed that there is no way to spray off the body of the sprayer . It would n't have taken a lot for the designers to allow the spray nozzle to connect to the first connector on the actual body of the sprayer . All-in-all , I feel really ripped-off by this . I only wish I could return it but Amazon will not allow it unless I pay to ship it back , which , at the lowest rate , would be about $ 30 . C'est la vie .	-1
Upside-down is the way to go . The house finches are completely baffled by this feeder while the goldfinches happily flop over to get their seed.As another reviewer said , squirrels wo n't touch thistle , but they do like the seed mixes . This feeder is all plastic , including the perches , unlike more expensive feeders that have metal perches . The squirrels will chew the plastic perches right off . Also , the plastic bottom of the feeder is held in only by a tiny tab and notch , so there 's a good chance of its falling out.In short , if this feeder lasts a couple of months that 's about all one can expect . If you want a more durable feeder , pay more for a better built model !	-1
I returned this product before I used it . I have chain saws but thought this would be an easy grab-and-go item for smaller jobs . But the thing requires oil every ten minutes of use ... ..and it takes a little doing to uncover the oil hole and do the job.It just seemed like an expensive toy that would be more trouble than cranking up the chain saw .	-1
I purchased this for use in my basement , cutting wood for the fireplace . I liked the lower jaw idea to avoid digging the chainsaw into the floor . Unfortunately , the design is extremely poor . The upper `` jaw '' kickback cover actually hits the chain when closed.One of the illustrations in the manual shows this upper jaw open perpendicular - when opened this far , the rear of the jaw actually impacts the chain . The chain cuts a large oval from the rear of the cover . When the jaw closes , it often does so at an off angle , actually hitting the chain , chewing up the upper jaw and dulling the chain . The lower jaw also closes crooked about 50 % of the time , causing the chain to cut into the lower jaw ! A photo on the box shows a person obviously cutting above shoulder height - yet one of the first warnings in the manual is to never cut above shoulder height ! This is common sense , but who approves the marketing and packaging ? ! ? The upper jaw has no `` stop '' except a small plastic flap . This broke off the third time I used the saw.If you run the saw with no wood in the `` jaws , '' the jaws snap open and closed as the chain randomly impacts them ! NOT SAFE ! When it cuts , it jams easily . Pieces of `` thready '' wood that a normal saw would kick out , get jammed up in the small gear that drives the chain . This has happened several times . Cutting dry wood - no problem . Cutting green wood , the `` thready '' pieces are a constant problem , necessitating the removal of the chain cover.The automatic oiler seldom works . I have to manually oil the chain . I have tried calling B & D ; 's toll free customer support number . I can never get a hold of anyone . I am regretful I purchased this shoddily designed item . I will add some photos showing the problems .	-1
I purchased these and then decided to run to Home Depot and see if they had them so I could use them sooner until my package arrived from Amazon . Home Depot had another brand called Revenge . I used the 4 from Revenge , each one smoked like they are supposed to . a few days later when the Giant Destroyers came , I needed to use those too and unfortunately , they did n't smoke , they shot a bright angry orange flame as if it was a blow torch . The GD 's you have to thread the fuse into the bomb which I thought was dumb . I also found that the GD 's smelled with stronger sulfur and could n't wash off the smell from my hands . I do n't know if they work or not as again they were blow torches and not smokers . Wo n't buy these again . Maybe i got a bad batch ? wo n't take the chance again though .	-1
This house may ( or may not ) leak , but it has a much more serious problem . My new hose reel requires female fittings on both ends of the leader hose and this 10 foot leader has a male fitting on one end and a female on the other , so it 's useless . My new reel requires a female fitting for attachment to the reel and it of course requires a female fitting at the faucet end ( as do all faucets ) . Also , the product smells really bad , so I 'm returning it to Amazon .	-1
Do n't waste your money on this piece of junk . The manor in which it stays open does not function properly at all . Real bad design ! ! There is no making this junk work . STAY AWAY . USE SOME OTHER TRAP !	-1
This electronic deer repellent is interesting , but I 'm afraid that there 's little way to know if it works . The idea is to entice deer with a scent so that they touch a set of wires looped at the top of the device , which sends an electrical shock to the deer . The instructions indicate that it is not intended for an area with a high concentration of deer and that you need to rotate through different scents to keep them from associating the shock with the scent item . The units came with an acorn scent and I can imagine teaching the deer to avoid acorns while they continue to eat your fruit trees or scrape their horns on our aspen trees . I 'm not sure whether they have reduced the damage that the deer have done in my yard , but my dog avoids acorns with a passion now . I guess that 's good though ... right ? I would say nice try , but maybe a bit off the mark .	-1
Well , for starters I live in Wyoming where deer in the yard is a menace , and if you are trying to start a yard with deer around forget about it . For three years now we have tried to re-landscape and resurrect our yard . Our high desert location is a major hurdle , but as our neighbors lawns prove it can be done the greatest enemy is actually the deer.These rods were just one more thing we tried and failed with . To be fair the scent that they are treated with is acorn which would be a completely alien scent to the deer in this area although I was hoping that it might lure them anyway . The rods were ignored . Also , I believe that the rainstorm that has hit us in the last three days might have shorted out the rods some how , as birds are roosting on them.This was an interesting idea and I was looking forward to seeing how it would pan out . So far the only thing we 've tried that has actually had any degree of success with has been straw . We covered the entire yard with straw to try and protect it for the winter and the deer actually seem to hate that . They wo n't even walk on it . Unfortunately when we raked it up for spring they 're baaaack !	-1
When human beings displaced deer from their natural habitat , we did something very disruptive - we replaced it with a much better habitat . Rather than pick among the sparse native shrubs , the deer now have a huge selection of succulent new food , imported into their environment at enormous expense . Not only that , but the suburbs discourage the predators which might have kept their numbers down : the many traffic accidents do n't compensate for this.Better habitat - fewer predators = uncontrolled population growth.Result ? Waking up in the morning , to find that all the tulips have vanished . Or worse , waking up in ER to find that you 've just collided with a deer.In the suburbs , the deer population has grown out of all proportion . We 'll welcome anything to keep the damned things out of our gardens . Unfortunately , killing them outright is illegal.The concept of the product is fairly simple . It 's basically a low-powered cattle prod , with a deer attractant . The idea is that the deer is attracted by the smell , licks the device , gets a mild shock , does n't like the experience . If they do it often enough , they get conditioned to stay away . Deer are not particularly intelligent , so the process takes a while . I 've been using devices like this for a few years . It works , a bit , but not well enough to replace deer repellent chemicals . The most effective repellent ( apart from a fence ) is spraying , but it has to be repeated . ( Even repellents do n't work for the young deer , who are unbelievably stupid , and will eat anything , including poisonous plants . ) This particular product is a tad clumsy . Others use a scent-impregnated piece of plastic , which needs to be replaced once a month ; this one has a ball of cotton wool , plus a bottle of attractant . I suspect any decent rain storm will wash it away . The instructions confirm this . Apparently I 'm supposed to add new attractant every week , and after rain . Not good.The instructions also recommend changing the attractant every so often , 'because the deer get used to it ' . This approach works for repellents , but is completely wrong for something designed to condition deer to stay away . I rather thought that the whole point is for the deer to associate the smell of the attractant with a shock ! Now that I 've installed these things in my garden , I realize that the people who design them did n't realize that they are supposed to blend into the environment . What possessed the manufacturer to give them red tops ! I 'll continue to use it throughout the season . If it seems more effective than its predecessors , I 'll let you know , but initial impressions are not favorable.Good luck in the Fight .	-1
This is a set of 3 battery-operated devices that are supposed to deter deer from eating your plantings . The devices consist of a plastic stake , about 18 '' high that you stick into the ground with a handy foot tab . On the top of each stake are two metal wires connected to a battery-operated charger , surrounding a casement that is to be filled with acorn-scented cotton balls ( cotton-balls and acorn scent included in the package ) . The intention is for the deer to be attracted by the acorn scent , sniff the top of the stake , get a mild shock from the wires , and then high-tail it out of your yard.The stakes were rather simple to assembly and load with AA batteries ( 2 needed for each stake ) . Instructions said to insert an entire cotton ball into each casement , but it was rather difficult to get an entire cotton ball in place . According to instructions , several drops of acorn scent should be distributed on the cotton balls after every rain , or at least once a week . I found it a little difficult to re-apply the scent drops with the sticks in the ground -- it 's much easier if you take the stakes out of the ground so you can apply the drops at an angle.The stakes are green plastic with red tips , and would probably be child-magnets for small children , so they are n't recommended for use around children . My hunch is that 1-3 year olds would learn to avoid the stakes even faster than deer , but I still would n't want to use them around young children . Older children might be tempted to pull up the stakes and use them for sword fighting , so they probably would n't be good to have in yards with older kids either.On the package , the manufacturer notes that the stakes are `` very effective '' in suburban areas where deer density is low and damage is mild , infrequent , and unpredictable . And `` not effective '' in rural areas where deer density is high , and damage is extreme and frequent . In other words , they 're most `` effective '' if you do n't have a real problem with deer . I was n't aware of these limitations when I ordered the product , but tried them out anyway in my blueberry plantings in front of my house , which is in a rural area with plenty of deer . I aimed my game camera at the stakes to see whether I could catch deer being deterred . My camera showed dozens of regular visits by deer to the blueberry plantings , in which the deer looked happy , content , and well fed , but not very deterred .	-1
I have to say that I am at fault for this one . I must have taken my stupid pills the day I requested these . For some reason I was thinking that `` electronic '' meant that there would be a sound deterrent or a light or something besides a shock . I should have read further before ordering.These were easy to assemble and install the batteries which were provided . My happiness ends there.The first thing that makes no sense is the `` lure '' that is applied to the tops of these . As a long time landscaper I learned eons ago that you never intentionally `` lure '' whatever you are trying to avoid ( i.e . japansese beetle traps ) . Only frustration and madness lie that way . So in order for these to work , you have to lure the deer to your yard so they can essentially stick their noses in the scent and therefore get this mild shock . It is all about training the animal as you would a dog with invisible fence.As someone who lives in a heavily wooded area I can tell you from nearly 30 years of experience that if a critter wants it , they will get it . Short of a physical barrier they will find a way around.These may be OK for someone in a suburban area , but if you have kids that are touching things these would be a no go.I 'll keep spraying repellent and letting `` nature take it 's course '' .	-1
We live in suburbia - 1/2 acre to 1 acre plots - in Westchester County New York . Lots of deer . These have an odd way of working . They actually use a scent to ATTRACT deer , then they use a shock to repel them . It 's a bit odd . Unless the deer actually touch the wires , they are never repelled - only attracted.I have n't done a statistical study , but I would say that the deer are MORE active on our property than they used to be . Previously , they would wander through . Now , they are curious and stick around because of the scent . I have only seen one deer ( a huge buck ) touch the wires . It only seemed mildly phased - and did n't run away or anything.These are also very dangerous if you have kids around . There are package warnings , but the wires give off a pretty good shock to humans - probably not enough to do any damage , but pretty unpleasant .	-1
When I requested this , a key bit of information was not listed on the Amazon product page . This info . is printed on the outside of the box & it says : Very Effective - Suburban Area . Deer density is low . Damage is mild , infrequent , unpredictable.Effective - Suburban Area . Deer density is medium . Damage is moderate , frequent , predictable.Effective ( if repellent is moved as deer travel pattern changes ) - Rural Residential Area . Deer density is medium to high . Damage is extensive , frequent , predictable.Not Effective ( A fence is the best option ) - Rural , Non-residential , Agricultural Areas . Deer density is high . Damages is extreme , frequent , unpredictable.I see this & say oh no ! I am in the `` Not Effective '' category aka `` do not buy this item - go get a fence '' I go on line & view the page thinking it must be here & I missed it . Nope . The above info . is not provided . Now you have it so you do n't unknowingly make the same mistake I did.Because I already committed to the product I gave it a go following the instructions . I chose a path the deer take past our young fruit trees . I put the lures along the path . They did nothing . I moved them in a tighter range after seeing the deer eating the tops of our young trees . Added more scent ( you do this once a week ) & the deer are out there everyday . No matter how tightly I have placed these together to protect even a tiny area as if I was not in the country or putting them along the path of the deer as directed it just does n't work . I did not place them far apart from each other even though we have a lot of land . I still followed the directions by choosing small areas to cover . I want that to be very clear.As far as the assembly goes , they were not as easy to put together as I thought . Before you snicker , read . Everything was very easy except trying to fit the middle pole into the bottom pole . On all 3 poles I had extreme difficulty . I thought I would end up breaking the little hard plastic tabs . I followed the assembly directions exactly & because of this the ends were charged & scented - all 3 . I 'm at my garden bench with charged polls rolling around while I battle it out trying to get a seemingly simple task accomplished . I grabbed a slender metal garden stake tried to keep the poll from rolling & discharging on the other polls or by the back of my arm hitting it while I tried to do 3 things with 2 hands , push in the tab , push the poll into the bottom & hold it still on the bench while not hurting myself . I know it probably sounds pathetic but I really did have a heck of a time with the bottoms . I would recommend putting on the bottoms first so you do n't have to worry about the charged tops & then assemble the rest per the directions . I think I would have had a much easier time if I did it that way . For once , it would have been better NOT to follow the directions ! At this point after weeks of using these I 'm not even sure what to do with them . I guess I could move them yet again , but I just do n't see the point . They are still out with the few fruit trees & they are scented with lure , but why ? They just do n't do a thing .	-1
I put these up in my yard around the fence line . The deer still came into my yard . Did n't seem to make any mind of these stakes . The instructions say to place them at the areas away from what you want protected . I followed the directions and the deer still enters the yard and eats the plants.Maybe if you combine these with other deterrents they may work better . I do n't know . These do n't seem to work .	-1
I agree with the one-star review titled `` Pointless '' written by `` Kitten Kisser '' . I live in an area that falls between the last two categories `` Rural residential '' and `` Rural non-residential agricultural '' - I have high deer density , damage is frequent but unpredictable . Since I installed them , I have n't seen any deer in my yard , but my schedule has been erratic , so it 's not unusual . I 've seen deer damage on plants near one of the three repellent stakes , but not near the other two . But then , I do n't know if I would have seen damage on those plants if the stakes were not there.I will continue to re-scent the stakes , at least as long as the supply lasts . And I 'll move the stakes , as the instructions say . But since my walnut tree got partly eaten , I do n't have high hopes for these stakes doing the job .	-1
I was hoping to use this in the non-fenced part of our yard , since that is where the deer shred our flowers.Be warned , if a bird alights on this , they will get a shock . If a fox or dog sniffs it , they too will get a shock.Not to mention children , and since we do n't have a fence in the front , children do cut through out yard.So , maybe if you live out in the country this would be useful . But if you live in the city and you do n't have a fence and there are children around ...	-1
Deers are the worse pest in New England . Not only do they destroy our gardens , they also spread Lime disease , a serious deer-tick born ailment that is named after a Connecticut town . For some unfathomable reason , the local politicians decide that , ours being a proudly liberal town , any hunting or trapping of deers is strictly forbidden all year round anywhere within the town border , making this town uniquely pro-deer in the state of Connecticut.Poor home owners who can not put up six-foot tall fences all around the properties are pretty much defenseless against these nasty invaders . Last year , my entire crop of okra as well as my wife 's prized lilies were gone in a single evening . It was not that we chose to do nothing , but the deer-repellant spray was washed away in a drizzle and the deers were free to munch on the tenderest new shoots . This year , we feel we have no choice but to pay up for the somewhat rain-resistant but much more expensiveDeer Scram 25 # Deer & Rabbit Repellent Granular White Pail . This blood/garlic mixture has worked for us so far , but I am constantly worried that the smell is fading fast with each rainy day.When I saw the phrase `` electronic deer repellent '' on Amazon , my heart skipped a beat in joy and wonder . Could this be the silver bullet to our deer problem ? I made the big mistake of not reading the detailed descriptions and the reviews until the item arrived . This `` repellent '' uses acorn scented oil to ATTRACT deers to one 's lawn only to gently send them away with a mild electric shock . Question 1 : what if the deers choose not to touch the metal part with their noses ? Question 2 : What about the deer ticks they carry ? Question 3 : Why would I want to attract all the deers in the neighborhood to my small property in the first place ? Do I really want to remind them how many tender and juicy flowers and vegetables I have just planted ? There is just no way I am going to put this boondoggle in my lawn . The only legitimate purpose of this thing I can think of is to use it as a bait while waiting around with a bow or a rifle , assuming that the acorn oil actually works . Maybe someone should market a similar product under the brand `` Havabrain '' ?	-1
**** Revised Review as of 6/16/11 ****I originally gave this product two stars and said it was `` ineffective '' . I am revising this to , `` causes more deer damage '' . It actually increased the number of deer visits to our yard , which is NOT a cottage in the forest ( suburbia as noted below ) . After giving it two weeks , my family begged me to please remove the `` repellents '' because they were bringing too many deer into the yard . My son erected a more effective measure ( metal wire fence ) and this seemed to do the job for about the same amount of money . Bottom line , I tossed these worthless ( actually , harmful ) units into the garbage can after removing the batteries . Avoid them unless you want more deer . If you do want more deer , it 's cheaper to go to the hunting supply store and buy the acorn scented deer attracter , soak a piece of cotton with it and leave it on a stick or something . It works about the same as these things , and it will be much less expensive . **** End of Revision ****We live in a suburban area in California 's `` Silicon Valley '' with paved streets , curbs , lawns , gardens and ... deer ! ! ! Out plants are eaten year-round by deer . They come down out of the hills where they live and trot down the paved roads a mile or so down to our home . We 've tried a lot of methods to either protect the plants ( fences , wires , predator scent , etc . ) with mixed results . So , when I had a chance to try out this new `` Electronic Deer Repellent '' my hopes were up for a while.The term `` repellent '' is somewhat misleading . these stakes are supposed to work ( they did NOT work for me ) by using a deer attracting scent ( acorn is the one that comes with the set ) to bring deer in contact with the wires on the top of the stake . The wires are charged up by two AA batteries much as an electric fly swatter , if you have seen or used one of those . The deer are supposed to be shocked when they put their nose on the wires as they attempt to get to the source of the acorn smell . So , the deer ca n't be `` repelled '' until they are `` attracted '' . The theory is understandable , but our results show it is seriously flawed in practice.In order to save your reading of the rest of this review , let me say this product had no positive effect at all on our deer issues . In fact , it may have worked to attract more deer ! Details:1 . Packaging : the product comes in a compact cardboard container that has three of the units . They require a modest amount of assembly . My set came with the requisite two AA batteries for each stake , but then this was a set for review . I do n't know if the commercial product has the same . The box is about 19 '' x 4 '' x 4 '' , which means it is easy to ship . The packaging seemed adequate to protect the goods , but not frustrating to open.2 . Assembly : I asked my 14 year old daughter to assemble the units . She did so with relative ease . The instructions and tasks to be done are simple . The units come in three main pieces ( spike , lower shaft , upper shaft with the power head ) , plus the two batteries . She had a minor struggle getting some of the plastic lock buttons to engage with the holes in the metal shaft , but it was not epic . Overall , it took less than ten minutes for her to finish . We will upload the video later this week.3 . Activation : The most difficult part of the use of these `` repellent '' stakes is to add the bait . You must stuff some loose cotton into holes in the top of the stakes and then add some drops of deer-attracting scent ( the kit comes with acorn scent ) . Inserting the cotton requires you to have a small stick , flat blade screwdriver , or similar to poke the cotton into its place . Then , you add drops of scent . The scent must be re-applied every few days.4 . Quick test : since our family has used electronic fly swatters for a few years , we thought this product may have some possibility of success . So , after putting it all together we tried to shock ourselves with the wires - which is against all the instructions and warnings provided by Havahart - and felt very little shock . Very , very little . As in , not enough to bother us at all - less than you 'd get from the door knob in your home after walking across the wool carpet . In our opinion , probably not enough to worry Mr. Deer.5 . Testing : the instructions claim 1100 sq ft coverage and we followed them to the letter . Our results were that MORE deer seemed to visit that part of the garden and that more deer returned later . We are giving it a few days just in case.Bottom line : it 's a crock !	-1
At first glance , the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent seems like it might work . It supposedly attracts deer with a scented lure ( a cotton ball at the top to which you apply the supplied scent drops ) and the deer , if they nudge it with their nose , get a shock from the wires that run down the post.Unfortunately , this underestimates the deers ' ability to bypass the post and munch your garden - as most deer would do . The package notes that it is designed for `` light deer pressure '' installations , such as urban back yards , and not for more rural or even suburban situations . My house is decidedly rural with high deer pressure , and the Havahart made zero difference in deer foraging in the garden . As you get only three in the package , you might need many more to protect even a small garden to any significant degree.And even in the urban setting , where this might work better , anything that attracts deer probably makes things worse rather than better . In this way it is a lot like the Japanese Beetle traps with their pheromone lures - while the traps may catch a lot of beetles , they also attract more beetles to the area.Sadly , the only thing that seems to really work on deer is a physical barrier , perhaps reinforced with a continuous electric fence .	-1
I set this up near my barn , and alas the deer seemed to ignore it 's effect.They still frequent the proximity of these stakes . I have tried everything , now I will feed the deer , and give up on the garden !	-1
I think I ended up purchasing this due to the wonderful color choices . I chose Yellow , its super easy to see in the grass . That 's where my positive review of this product ends . It never worked correctly from the start . All functions worked great , except the soaker . It sort of just squishes water out of a little bit of all of the other functions and around the edge ... Comparing it to any hose nozzle I 've used in the past this is n't how the soaker function is designed to work . It was n't hardly worth my effort to send it back . The other ( and more important to me ) functions worked so I just dealt with it . I have now had it for right about two months and I realized the little metal piece that holds the on/off grab bar on the `` on '' position is missing . Now THAT was a function I deem essential . I used it all the time . I think two months is a little bit short to fall apart ! Its possible that I got a bad apple , but I would n't buy the identical model to replace it . I 'll try something else .	-1
This nozzle seemed to be well made and it worked great for a few weeks.After about 2 months of occasional use ( maybe used it 4-5 times during that time ) , the whole nozzle started to leak water everywhere . Another reviewer mentioned that the internal components of this nozzle are made from cheap plastic and will break easily from regular use , and it seems they were right . No pressure at all on the trigger and there is water going everywhere . I just turn on the hose and immediately this nozzle starts leaking water.Do n't waste your money , get something better .	-1
When I turn the water on , the nozzle starts spraying water , without me touching it or pushing the handle . Today I wanted to wash my yard , I left the hose with the nozzle on the floor until I turned the water on . By the time I got to the hose , the water coming out from the nozzle soaked my coffee table in the living room through the screen door that was closed . The water on the nozzle is always on until I turn off the water supply . This is totally unacceptable .	-1
I bought this and a bag of Scotts grass seed to cover an area of my back yard that was recently regraded after construction . The spreader worked OK for the first few minutes , then became harder and harder to crank . Too much friction for the plastic parts maybe . I 'm glad the space I had to cover was n't any larger . What a pain . I could have done just about as well pitching handfuls from the bag . I think I wasted my money .	-1
This would maybe be 3 stars if it worked outdoors , but I would not chance it ! It has a very cheap build for the cost and has the electric switch and electronics on top , exposed to weather , so I would not want to use it outdoors ( as I had intended ) . I bought a simple Haveaheart trap and sent this back . If you intend it for indoors , it would work probably fine , but it still looks cheap for the price . I just was unimpressed .	-1
For two days , I 've giggled with glee upon seeing the unit 's flashing red light of SUCCESS . That was until I kept coming up EMPTY and disappointed the bugger got a free meal . I 've reset and refilled with a few dog kibble about 10 times and zapped NOTHING ! I 've been dry toweling the plates after every 3 entry and departures to avoid dirty build up that could impede the powerful , much desired RAT DEATH RAY.After attempting to access the Ratzpper.com website which is UNAVAILABLE , I called the 1888-DEAD-RAT several hours ago without a callback . Now those furry critters are catching a break until I get sturdy traps and toxic waste disposal gloves . I HATE mice , rats & most icky rodents and have no plans to continue running a fine dining establishment for them.This contraption is too blankity-blank expensive to be a bust . In case you have n't guessed it , I DO NOT RECOMMEND this thing ! PS CALL Amazon Customer Service if purchased through them for a refund.UPDATE 1/22/2013A smart and pleasant Technical Support person from Raticator called with helpful hints . Having a moist cloth/paper towel leading to the front of the Ratzapper acts as a WELCOME MAT to a `` shocking experience '' when the critter makes contact with the metal plates inside . The Raticator company provides support temporarily for Ratzapper which is no longer produced . With that in mind , you need to consider that when getting a Ratzapper . Getting a refund and finding a consistently working pest eliminator is my goal .	-1
I 've used Deer Off before and did n't have very good results with the sprayer so I decided to try the concentrate formula.It states to NOT use on plants that are intended for human consumption so all of our garden plants that are getting eaten by the squirrels and deer have no hope at . We used it on other plants and the plants that we applied it to had burned brown areas on them in a few days.We also applied it around the bird feeder to keep the squirrels away and to some trees to keep the deer from rubbing up on them , all with no results . The best thing that we have found is to try and plant Deer-resistant plants when possible . For the garden , I have no clue how to keep those pesky squirrels out .	-1
I have 12 bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard . A lot of the bird food falls to the ground . This works well in feeding large birds that are too big to perch on the feeders . It also attracts many squirrels . I have separate feeders for squirrels but they are not satisfied with just their feeders and gobble up the bird seed as well which leaves very little for the big birds . I sprayed Deer Off around the bottom areas of the bird feeder poles in the hopes that squirrels would be repelled . After the Deer Off had dried the squirrels returned in full force to their old stomping grounds . I swear I could hear them giggling at me.This product should be labeled `` Rip Off '' based on its cost and lack of performance .	-1
My problem is rabbits , cats and squirrels.This product is more difficult to use than Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent Granular Shaker . You have to dilute the concentrate , then spray it from your own sprayer . I was tempted to just pour the concentrate around , but did n't . This product sprays on the foliage , while the granules stay on the ground . This may be a better product for deers since they are not close to the ground , but deers are not my problem.The product smells horrible , but that 's how it works . Do n't spray it in the wind . Really . I mean it.You can still smell a faint odor when it dries.It seems to wash off after one rain.It seemed to have no effect no rabbits , squirrels and cats . For these critters , the granules seem to work better.Finally , the measuring cup that comes with the concentrate and sits on top of the cap shattered in transit . This was annoying .	-1
Perhaps the squirrels in my yard have developed a fondness for `` putrescent egg '' or find the allure of bird seed and budding leaves offsets the supposed repellent tastes and odor of `` Deer Off . '' I 've followed the direction , applied this product twice to the same plants , shrubs , and area . I coated the bird feeders and ground around them with Deer Off , and I also liberally applied it to the aerial access points via tree limbs and trunks , bushes , even stairs.The squirrels remain undeterred . They continue raiding the raised beds , climbing to the bird feeders , and generally seem unperturbed . If they were wearing clothes pins on their noses or had tiny gas masks , then that would be one thing . So I still have to dispatch the Aussies to chase the squirrels when I catch the varmints in the act.This repellent does work during the time I am actually spraying it on stuff to the point it coats surfaces and drips to the surrounding ground . I think , however , that my presence may be the deterrent during those moments of respite from the rodents ' continual engorgement .	-1
The drought and drought restrictions has caused most vegetation to dry out and more varmints to munch on almost anything green or juicy . They 're desperate and trying to catch a break which I understand . I just do n't want to chance the illnesses they spread with their droppings or traveling guests ( fleas , ticks etc ) .I tried this formulation to keep the varmints away . The product 's offensive rotten egg smell does that BUT it dissipates after 3-4 days and the munchers return to make up for lost time . I guess our Texas varmints are used to hot sauce and chili pepper because it does NOTHING to keep the varmints away.In essence , it keeps varmints and neighbors away for a few days but that 's it . This may work better where the animals are not in such desperate conditions . It did n't keep the Texas varmints at bay long enough to cost justify this product .	-1
I have reviewed several different Deer Repellent products in the past 2 years and am still hopeful that either something new that works will come out or a new formula of an old standby will do the trick.The market is still prime for a great product to emerge ... ..The putrescent egg and hot pepper combo is not working . I think the local southeastern deer are starting to like hot & rotten.There are a couple of other details that make this product loose a couple of stars besides the fact that it does repel all deer : - The advertising that you can use it on organic gardens but not anywhere near food crops is misleading.- The price at $ 38 for 32 oz is slightly over $ 1.18 an oz and 32 oz only makes 2 gallons of repellent . This is suppose to treat 400 ornamental plants 4 feet tall or 4000 sq ft of plantings . But spraying top and bottom of leaves as per directions really gives much less than 400 plants . These would have to be very small . I estimate that with my professional backpack sprayer with constant pressure tip installed and on a very fine mist spray pattern that I would only be able to spray approx 100 ornamental 4 ft tall plants . Not sure where they are getting their numbers.So I am still waiting for that perfect deer repellent ... ..Sorry this may not be the review you were hoping to read about . Please comment if you have found a product that works great and I will add your comments to this review.2 stars . 3 lost ( one each ) for effectiveness , advertising , and cost.Hope this helps .	-1
Deer Off 32 Ounce Deer , Rabbit and Squirrel Repellant comes as a concentrate , so you will need another container to use . I have a fenced in property so do not have deer . However , I have rabbits and it does n't work to deter the little buggers . I gave it 3 stars because I do not know if it is effective against deer .	-1
I got this to put on vegetable plants that were being decimated by squirrels . When I read the instructions it said to not apply it to any plants that produced edible foods , that it was not safe on human food . As that was the point for this product , which is kind of marketed as a natural repellent ( I was imagining it was wolf urine , or something ) this is pretty much useless for me .	-1
The squares are about 4x4 inches . Animals just get tangled in it . Birds can fly right through it . It is an AWFUL product . Look for & # 34 ; deer & # 34 ; netting at your local feed or hardware store that is made from fish netting type material . Waste of money .	-1
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development , metabolism , reproductive activity and many more ( E.g. , see Science Daily `` Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally '' , January 22 , 2013 , or Google for a very long list of other articles . The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and does n't seem to be disputed . ) I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not . They replied that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders . They also explicitly stated that they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder . Let 's encourage them to change that stance ! I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do . Even if one is n't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds , consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations . Furthermore , consider the food chain and the general fact that we 're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it . This feeder has many great properties , but it 's not the only feeder with them ; personally I will buy alternatives ( of which there are many ) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs . I would love to see them do so .	-1
Not anywhere as near useful as I 'd hoped . Slow and a lot of hard work for very little gain . I would not recommend it .	-1
I have clay soil . It immediately clogged the tines . You can keep making holes with the tines clogged , but since the soil is not being ejected , all you are doing is further compacting the soil below . You may think you are helping your lawn , but you are actually making it worse . I suspect this is a good tool if you have soil that is dry , or sandy , and therefore likely to eject from the top . With my type of soil , which is fairly common , it was basically useless . Please check your soil before spending your hard-earned money on this .	-1
Yard Butler generally makes good products that I like . This , unfortunately , is n't one of them.I 've got a small amount of lawn that gets lots of traffic , so this , if it worked , would make great sense.I tried using this with the lawn at various stages of moistness , in case that was the issue . In each instance the aerator jammed , repeatedly . In some cases , un-jamming the unit was very difficult . It is currently waiting for me to unjam it with a hammer drill and masonry bit.I do n't recommend this unit .	-1
the first day I had it and was digging and planting in my garden the main shovel broke in half at the neck I am more careful now but it was very low quality material and split way to fast and way way to easy	-1
Well , it worked for a little over a year . I used the trimmer twice a month with no issues.I noticed the blade was getting worn down and quite dull . Changing the blade proved to be the downfall of the trimmer.To change the blade you insert a screwdriver in the slot behind the blade to lock the hub . The metal around this hub is very cheap pot metal . The metal hub broke apart in 7 pieces when trying to remove the blade nut.I hope everyone has better luck than me , but I wo n't buy another one.I 'm kinda miffed that this trimmer only lasted 13 months . They should n't be disposable .	-1
Tried this for a Month with no results . The unit no has moisture and corrosion and has died . I waisted money on this one . I swabbed the plates to keep them clean and kept the peanut butter away from them . Too bad I liked the idea but it 's back to the old Victor 'finger whapping ' old fashioned trap .	-1
I 've used every mouse trap on the market over the past 20 years , so I have a pretty good perspective on which ones are most effective ( at least for New England mice ) .I tried this electronic trap in a an attic where several other types of traps are also installed and catching mice . The electronic trap never caught a single mouse . Eventually the batteries died . Between the zero success rate , and the need to feed it batteries , I put this model at the bottom of the list of all the different types of traps I 've tried.The old fashioned snap traps are the cheapest and most effective traps . Unfortunately , they also come with significant drawbacks : They 're unpleasant to deal with after you 've caught a mouse , you ca n't use them where children or pets might find them , and they 're a little tricky to set . Glue traps have similar pros and cons , and they have the further disadvantage of seeming inhumane ( even if you do n't have an emotional attachment to mice ) .The best trap I 've found , by far , is the Victor `` Tin Cat '' model . It 's a metal box with one-way trap doors . Mice seem to find it irresistible , and it can catch several mice in one night ( in fact , it 's almost as if the first mouse in the trap attract others ) . The biggest downside is that it 's a `` live catch '' trap , so you have to check it every day and then take it far away from the house to release the mice .	-1
So far my mice simply enter these traps , eat the bait , and leave ( sans zap ) leaving some mouse poop right nearby as an F/U to me that they were n't falling for my fancy zapper traps . More traditional traps I bought after these also failed to catch any mice ( but at least the mice did n't take the bait this time ) .My mice have no reason to suspect traps as I have thus far relied on my two cats to keep the house mouse free and it has n't been an issue for years . That is if you do n't count the occasional mouse corpse left diligently just outside the bedroom door for me to walk on half-asleep the morning after the kill ... Then recently I started noticing mouse poop but no mouse corpses and assumed the cats were't keeping up their side of the deal . So , loving electronic toys , I got these expensive Thomas Edison style electrocution mouse traps which failed , followed by traditional snap traps which also failed . So I guess the little critters are smarter than I thought and the cats are back on Tuna.In any case these are batting a zero so far but are still baited as are the snapers . Time to try something else.I promise to update this review if they ever come through.PS : Cleaned all the contacts , tested the batteries , not over-baiting , or letting the bait touch the contacts . As I bought two I am doubtful that they are defective , just apparently not very effective.UPDATE : Caught one mouse in a snapper trap ; same bait . So far the zappers have got none.UPDATE # 2 : Latest count is These traps = 2 kills - Old Fashioned snapper traps = 4 kills . I seem to me mouse free now .	-1
Pros : - Compact , sturdy , easy to setupCons : - Expensive- Very hard to clean the peanut butter out of the unit- Given the above , actual reusability and longevity is in questionMy major gripe on this product is how hard it is to clean . The peanut butter ca n't sit in there forever , eventually it gets a little rotten and you do n't want that smell in your house so it has to be cleaned . The peanut butter , once smeared to the back wall , is imbedded into the vent holes and into the cracks and corners of the inside compartment . I bought 2 units and each unit took me 20 minutes to clean with a bunch of toothpicks , qtips anda bottle of rubbing alcohol . Not well designed with this in mind at all and at this price point , I expect more . Perhaps the sellers are just hoping you 'll give up and throw it out so you can buy another one from them ? It 's cynical to think so but go ahead and try cleaning one and you 'll likely agree with me .	-1
This is a good price for a no-frills garden sprayer . I 'm not expecting a miracle at this price point and because of its all plastic construction , durability may be an issue . For $ 10 , I can live with ordering a replacement if it breaks down after a 8 months to a year , but hopefully it wo n't . [ Product has now failed . Please see update at end of review . ] I was looking for a labor-saving way to hydrate the more delicate plants and flowers in my garden and maybe administer some plant food through foliar feeding . I had been using a spray bottle and all that squeezing was very tough on the hands , so I finally decided to do the right thing and get a sprayer . Assembly is very easy . Attach the hose to the wand , attach other end to bottle . Fill with water or your desired mix of fertilizer or bug killer , insert and screw on the pump/handle and you 're ready to rock 'n ' roll . Flow rate is very satisfactory and you can adjust the spray pattern from a single stream to a fine mist by twisting the nozzle cap . Fully pumped , the stream reaches approx 25 ft out.Design FlawsI do n't like that the carrying handle and the pump action are one and the same . There 's a little notch that the handle locks into when you rotate it clockwise . This secures the handle in place so that you can carry the sprayer . To pump again , you have to twist it 1/4 turn counter-clockwise so you unlock the handle . Once fully pressurized , dissipation rate is good , but I did n't like the extra step of having to lock and unlock the handle each time . I have to set the sprayer down , unlock , pump , lock again , pick up , then spray . Another minor issue is the squeaking sound of the pump , which I do n't really mind , but just pointing it out in case you do.A secondary problem is the length of the hose ( about 3 ft. ) With the sprayer being held in a relaxed position in one hand ( hanging straight down like a shopping bag ) , I can only bring my other hand to about mid-chest height in front of me . I ca n't raise my wand hand above my head to mist tall trees and objects . On mist mode , you can comfortably spray anything from ground height to about 8 ft without having to raise the bottle higher.Thirdly , there 's no caddy or snap-in clasp to keep the wand secure when the sprayer is not in use . I am expecting a random mishap to snap the wand because of this -- either someone walking by and the wand snagging on some clothing , or it being stepped on . The wand looks especially fragile and susceptible to cracking . It is this product 's weakest link . Some sort of loop for attaching a shoulder strap to wear the sprayer would also be a welcome addition.Overall , the Chapin 20000 is easy to use , but not without some design annoyances . For what I paid , I am satisfied with this product so far.UPDATE : DIY Strap Add-on ModificationI was able to fashion myself a strap for the sprayer out of 2 key rings and a camera bag strap . Stamped onto the vertical support vane on either side of the neck is a circular identation ( visible in product blowup ) . You can punch it out with a screwdriver and insert the key rings , then attach a shoulder strap . I now have a wearable sprayer that leaves my other hand free for other gardening tasks . It 's a bit clumsy and looks funny , but it works.UPDATE 8/28/10I am downgrading this product to 2 stars because after 4 days , the spray release mechanism has now unexpectedly snapped off . I had concerns about the durability of this product because of its all-plastic construction and did not expect it to last for very long , but less than a week is unacceptable , with less than 4 gallons of use out of this sprayer . The handle is reattachable via snap pegs , but it wo n't stay on due to the force of the spring in the release value . The clamp had become worn . When pushed down , the lever pops back out . Buyer beware ! Not recommended .	-1
In order to unlock the pump handle you have to turn the handle the same direction as you & # 8217 ; d turn it to open the lid thus releasing any air still sealed in the reservoir and misting your hands with the chemical in the reservoir . So , once you have the pump handle unlocked you have to wedge your fingers down onto the collar and twist it to re-seal the lid . Then you pump it up , press the handle back down and lock it back in place . You have to go through this process every time you want to pump the reservoir back up . I returned this item the same day I opened it .	-1
It does work and works great when it works , but having to stop and unstick the line from itself is a pain you know where . This is my first wire purchase for a specific trimmer I just purchased , though , so I do n't know if this will happen on other brands , but it never happened on a previous trimmer I had .	-1
We have lots of leaves in the fall in spring and the second time we used this the strap came off and we had to fix it . So I ca n't recommed this .	-1
This is a certifiable piece of junk . It lacks sufficient power to cut anything . Worx has a similiar product with a decent battery . I replaced my B & D with the Worx and it does a better job .	-1
We 've had many trimmers over the years . These by far are the worst we 've ever had.The problem is the design of both the grass shears and the mini hedge shears . They do not cut anything . They are dull and set too far apart to effectively cut anything.Plus for a 7.2 volt , which should be very powerful and have a long life battery this machine fails.I usually love Black and Decker items , but these were returned after 10 minutes of attempted use .	-1
Please do n't let the fact that this nozzle costs a fair bit of money fool you into thinkging that this is an all metal product . See the screw right in the center of the stainless steal spray head ? It 's attached to a thin plastic core . So , when you twist the outer rim to seat the metal spray head thereby shutting off the water , the relatively thin plastic core is stressed and in short time , snaps . The spray head is then no longer attached to anything , falls out , and water gushes everywhere . It becomes a useless hunk of metal and plastic parts . I am going to try a high strength 'epoxy ' repair but I do n't hold out much hope . Rather than twisting the rim to shut off the water , you could use one of these ; Dramm 12353 Heavy-Duty Brass Shut-Off Valveto do the on off work.After further consideration : If they made parts available , I 'd fix it , put it back in action and appreciate its other , more robust characteristics.But until they do , I do not think you get what you pay for.UPDATE : Epoxy does n't stick to the kind of plastic they used to make the core .	-1
During their seven to 10-day life span , Fungus Gnat females may lay up to 200 eggs into the cracks and crevices of growing media . Moist-growing media containing high amounts of peat moss are particularly attractive to adult females.I have 2 , 50 pellet pot jiffy seedling starters . I ordered these for refills because it was more fpr a cheaper price . Now I know why..You can tell these were at least last years old stock or older . You can tell that simply by how long it takes the pellets to absorb the water . It should really only take 1 minute to absorb . These took over 3 to 5 minutes . Most of the seeds I planted when using this batch of pellets did not grow . I was going to try to save the peat to mix with some potting soil.When I opened the pellets there were tons of Fungus Gnat Larvae feeding on the seeds inside . YUCK Yuck Yuck ! THANK GOD I CAUGHT THIS BEFORE THEY TURNED INTO FLIES ! MY HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN INFESTED ! Yes , I blame these pellets and not my seeds or myself . I have never had this issue before.In order to not waste the money I spent buying these I am going to have to spend more money on an insecticide and mix it with the water , when using them..Yes , I am sure the eggs were in the peat pellets and not from me or my home etc.I Know these are old stock , and had eggs in them hence , bad stock ! I will not be buying from this seller again ! Buyer beware.This is my first ever bad review . Trust me , that tells you something ! ... ... Move on !	-1
After ordering a couple other of the wrong size pellets , I was excited to get these under the impression that they would be the correct 42mm size . As received by seller toolboxsupply , these are the 36mm pellets ( which , by the way , seem to be much more widely available ; I 'm having problems finding the 42mm size anywhere , but I was REALLY expecting these to be that size because the product 's title explicitly states this ) .I assume this might depend a bit on the seller -- but I doubt I 'm going to try buying these from Amazon again , this being my second attempt . I am hesitant to rank the *product* down for that reason , but it 's really apparently a problem with this *listing* and one that I do n't want others to fall into this trap . I 'd avoid this unless you do n't really care which size you get -- but if you have the flats already ( and I do n't know why or how you 'd use these without them ) , it *does* matter.I 'd like to give the product itself more stars : while perhaps more expensive than loose seed starting mix , these work well and are very easy to use assuming you follow the directions . Plus , the netting is easy to remove when transplanting or potting up with minimal root disturbance ( as long as you do n't let the roots get so big they creep through the netting ) . But it seems exceptionally difficult to find correctly-sized , reasonably priced pellets for your existing Jiffy flats ( they make at least four sizes I know of , ranging from 30-50mm ) . But because of problems with the listing or at least some sellers , I do n't think I can do that . I 'll revise if this problem is ever fixed , because the product itself does work well if you manage to find the right one among Jiffy 's lack of size labeling ( and apparently Amazon 's or others ' confusion ) . Additionally , Amazon 's return process is easy.For those who actually want 42mm pellets ( the kind that come with theJiffy 5032 Professional Greenhouse 25-Plant Starter Kitand perhaps others ) , Jiffy 's official refill is theJiffy 5777 Refill , 25-Count , but you 'll notice that on Amazon , it 's more expensive than the original kit with that number of pellets plus the kit ( flat and dome cover ) itself ! I was able to find it more cheaply elsewhere , but just be warned.I 'd be curious how many others actually received 42mm pellets as the listing states or who maybe did n't notice that they got the wrong ones . I 'd also be curious who they purchased it from .	-1
I have used peat pods for years now . I was not impressed with these due to the basic problem that these did not work well with seed , and I did compare these with some others I purchased at Home Depot side by side . The others 100 percent sprouted and grew , and these 1 out of 10 grew I am sorry to say .	-1
Unbelievable expense when adding in green house expenses for such a poor yield . Very disappointed in the way all has gone so far ... ... ..	-1
This is a great little feeder . Sticks very well to the window and does n't get poopy ( let 's not talk about the window sill beneath ) and holds a pretty decent amount of seed . My acrobatic squirrels can leap onto it when I forget to throw out enough critter food to appease them and after at least 3 years of doing so , they finally broke it . So today I 'm ordering another one . Nothing fancy here , just a durable and fun bird feeder.Updated 5/29/2013 : the replacement I bought has a quality control problem with the suction cup portion that holds the feeder to the window ( kinda important ) . One of the suction cups was noticeably thin and seemed to have a hard time holding onto the glass . Turns out ( after cleaning the glass multiple times , moistening the cup or not moistening it ) that it just wo n't hold onto the glass for more than , say , 30 minutes . This is without any squirrel attacks . It just falls away . So half the support for the thing is just not there and shortly after you place it , it will sag to one side hanging on the one good cup and look really , really sharp ( not ) . Oh well , at least I got one working suction cup instead of none.Yes , this is a very inexpensive item but it 's not a high-tech or complex item to get right either . It 's meant to hang onto a window . If it ca n't properly do that , there 's a problem . This is likely a sample defect but it should never have gotten to the end user in this condition.Fortunately the remains of my old one were still in the trash bin and I retrieved the old window attachment part , which still works fine , so I 'm good for now . Glad the trash pickup was n't a day sooner or this thing would have ended up in the bin the following week .	-1
I would love to review this product , but one of the pieces arrived broken and there 's no number or address to ask for a replacement part ! I 've informed Amazon , but it 's been almost a week and no reply . So , here 's what I can tell you . The bench looks beautiful . Nice , dark wood and looks very sturdy when assembled correctly . But I would never buy another product from this company as there is no way to get a hold of them when a piece is broken or missing !	-1
I 've never heard of the company that 's selling this . And I 'm glad , because when products like this , they 'll be out of business VERY soon.I 'm not going to detail every problem with this thing , but perhaps enumerate a few:1 . The stain is applied completely unevenly . Some pieces are much darker , and there are run/splotch marks all over.2 . There is no protective material around anything in the box . This leads to problems later in the life of the bench : a . There are numerous spots all over that have had their stain rubbed nearly completely off.b . A couple people come with pegs in them : all but two come broken.c . A long piece that appears to be provided for additional stability : broken in the box ( no visible damage to the box. ) 3 . The top wood grain in the picture looks nothing like what I have . It 's just more of the same `` stain '' glopped all over.4 . The wood pieces , especially the center support piece , does n't line up correctly . It 's about an 1/4 of an inch too short.5 . Want to call the company to ask for spare pieces or warranty info ? Too bad for you : there is no contact information anywhere , save for the outside of the box - the same place that has this product incorrectly labeled `` OUTER DOOR BENCH . '' The correct label : a bunch of broken scrap wood.The only redeeming factor of this entire piece of garbage is that the instructions are n't confusing because of a bad translation : there are a total of 4 words , and some weird picture/diagrams that are n't entirely accurate for putting this thing together.Do n't waste your money on this . It 's absolutely horrible . If you happen to get lucky and they figure out that padding small pieces during shipment is a good idea - and hire some QA for other aspects , it 's still not a very good product : most build-it-yourself pieces , when you screw them together , have the metal hardware generally hidden from view . Not this gem : the `` official '' pictures here appear to be some cheap 3D renderings and not an actual product picture ; you can see screws in the legs and across the top ridge in the real thing.A bad design for a bench from a company that likely has no quality assurance . Do you really want to waste your money on it ?	-1
This is a nice looking bench if you do n't look too closely . The finish is rough and uneven in many places as if it were applied unevenly . This does not give it a rustic look but instead looks sloppy . The quality of the wood is poor . It looks and feels like pine , although it may be fir . It 's definitely not a hardwood.The bench was shipped UPS and arrived in a thin cardboard box , not the usual sturdy box that I 'm accustomed to receiving from Amazon . The pieces were loosely wrapped in foam . No bubble wrap , nothing to secure it but some tape . Consequently , I was n't surprised that them main support bar ( the curved one at the bottom ) was split in half . Because it was split on an angle we were able to repair and secure it with zip ties . Looks a little odd but it worked . Several other pieces have cracks in them but were not broken all the way through.Since I received this as a Vine review item we proceeded to assemble it rather than return it . Assembly was very easy and we had the bench put together in about 10 minutes . The screws and hardware provided were high quality , better than the wood for the bench itself ! I am using it by my patio table on the back deck . It seats two and is sturdier than it appears . Only time will tell how well it will withstand the rain and sun . If it becomes unstable for people to sit on , it will be re-purposed as a stand for some of my potted plants in the front garden.Because of the high cost ( $ 89 ) , the horrible way it was shipped and the broken parts ( others have had the same problem so it 's not just my UPS route ) , I am forced to rate this lower than I would have liked , but it 's just not worth it unless the company makes some changes .	-1
This product is very cheaply made . Although my bench had all the parts and none of the wood was broken - it is very clear that the wood is very soft ( probably pine ) and will be a one-season bench . The one I received also lacked the rustic 2-tone look that the Amazon picture presents . Mine is stained a dark brown and it almost looks like it is painted . The finish is not consistent and there are quite a few spots showing irregularity that could have easily been smoothed out when the finish was still wet.On a plus side - the one I received went together quickly ( I would recommend using a cordless drill/driver ) . The assembly directions were only illustrations and although they lacked detail - there was enough information to put this bench together with little problem . My product was adequately padded during shipping and it did n't suffer any damages through the mailing process.Overall , this is a very basic bench that two people can sit on . There is no doubt in my mind that it is going to wear very prematurely and frankly if you want to extend its wear - you probably should be storing it in a dry area when it 's not in use . I personally think that it is horribly overpriced for the quality and workmanship . My Bench was a complimentary product through the Vine program - I really think that had I paid for this item I probably would have sent it back .	-1
I assembled this bench right after it was delivered . I expect MUCH MUCH better quality for the price of this bench ! The directions are bit confusing because the wooden parts are labeled A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , etc and so is the hardware .It is not very big , you could fit two people but it would be tight.The quality is poor . There are all kinds of marks , places where the finish was gone do to damage . There were a couple of places where big chunks of wood were missing but they put the finish right over these areas.The finish is very splotchy with areas/spots that are a different color than the finish . Many scratches , digs , rough areas on the wood . It looks like they may have used a wood filler in some areas and instead of sanding those areas down and staining to match the wood they just put the finish over these areas , but it did not adhere and the wood filler comes off.It looks like they used odd pieces of wood , ( pieces maybe leftover from other projects that they did n't want to waste ) , or collected leftover wood from a lumber yard , I do not know . I do know this bench is poor quality and I question how well it would stand up to the elements . I think I will sand it a bit and use some marine grade polyurethane on it .It might work better as a plant stand ! or instead of a fire pit bench you could use it to burn in the fire pit ! ! I took several photos but you can only do a video on here . I would never recommend this bench to anyone . Way over priced for the quality and construction .	-1
I applied the product as stated , still had problems . I even threw it in a garbage can with 1 bag of garbage to see if it would scare anything off.. nope . Luckily my garbage is far away from the house where it is n't a horrible issue and I can feel good I feed the critters all year round .	-1
Maybe the neighborhood cats relieve themselves in the flower beds a little less often . Maybe . It does n't affect the squirrels at all . The Deer Off spray from Havahart works better at keeping the squirrels away but even that is only temporary.Maybe it will work better for others . We have what amounts to a wildlife sanctuary in our back yard . The neighborhood is full of pecan and oak trees . Those trees are full of squirrels . We have bird feeders to attract birds . The bird feeders also attract the squirrels . The birds and squirrels attract cats . Sometimes the cats get lucky with a bird or squirrel but mostly the cats just hang out and turn the flower beds into latrines . The squirrels destroy plants and containers and chew through wood trim on the house and get into the attic . If the cats would only eat all the squirrels and leave the birds and flower beds alone it would be welcome . Does n't happen . And this stuff ai n't makin ' it happen either.This stuff does n't work for us . You might have better luck ... if you 're not living in a wildlife sanctuary like we are .	-1
This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients . It even looks like pepper , and smells somewhat like pepper . The three main , active ingredients are : # 1 . Oil of black pepper : 0.48 % by weight. # 2 . Piperine ( comes from black pepper ) : 0.185 % by weight. # 3 . Capsaicin : 0.032 % by weight.The other 99.3 % are `` other ingredients '' .When you open the big blue jug , please note , it is five pounds by weight , but the jug is about 3/4 full , so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.I used it around the perimeter of my home , which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats , chipmunks , and deer . I also have a pet dog and cat . I did not expect miracles , and as with any product of this type , you need to accept that it is a deterrent , which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors , nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals , I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times . Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property . I tried a couple of applications in various places . None of the chipmunks , cats , squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all . I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions . In fact , I ended up applying it heavier than instructed , and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.But , if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach , I do not see any reason to pay $ 5 or $ 6 a pound for this product . 5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces . Since the active ingredients ( various forms of pepper ) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar , or about half an ounce , you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own , homemade powder for far less.For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs , I use a mixture of tap water , some chili powder and one egg ( left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle ) , along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion . So you could possibly not use the egg ( attracts some animals , even when rotten ) and add a little more pepper , dish soap or baking soda . You 'd end up with something that would work as well as this product .	-1
I was hoping that this product would keep the squirrels out of the fruit trees , but it did n't phase them.One of our pear trees is far enough from other trees that they ca n't just jump from tree to tree , so I decided to try this product around it . Less than an hour after applying the product all around the tree , the squirrels were crossing the band to climb and retrieve fruit.Other reviews seem to indicate that it work from some people in some situations , but our squirrels are determined to strip the fruit from every tree and this product did n't stop or slow that process .	-1
I got this in the spray bottle and it works just as poorly . I shake the product around my plants and it works fine until we have a dry spell and everything is withered except my garden . Then NO-thing will prevent critters from raiding your watered plants . What a disappointment .	-1
I got this product hoping it woud keep squirrels away from my bird feeders . I have six squirrel proof bird feeders . My squirrels , Mensa members all , have figured out how to overcome the `` squirrel proofing '' and eat the bird food until the feeders are completely empty . I placed generous amounts of Critter No-Ridder under each of my feeders . As soon as I walked away the squirrels were back and I could hear them giggling and winking at each other as they brushed away the No-Ridder whle giving me knowing glances . This is a genuinely useless product , at least as far as squirrels are concerned .	-1
I did not have any success repelling rabbits with this product . I wish I had though , because I hate rabbits and they 're ruining my lawn.I had much better luck using this product : Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer , Rabbit , and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered SprayerGood luck !	-1
This product is presented as a safe and effective deterrent for a variety of animals . The active ingredients are pepper compounds , the scent of which can deter animals . However , I 've found that many animals are n't really affected by the application of Critter Ridder , either because it wears off quickly or is n't active enough in the 1st place . If you use it I would recommend a solid application in the areas where you 'd like to repel animals , if it 's too weak then animals can easily adapt and ignore it . Also , rains neutralize it , so it 's a waste to apply it during rainy season . I believe you could create your own herbal animal repellents with plant oils and extracts and get better results than using these granules . The granules may seem convenient and safe , but so far they seem low on the scale of effectiveness . The cats , dogs , and rodents in my area do n't seem that disturbed by this repellent , and applying even larger amounts in hopes of making the application stronger would make the cost excessive .	-1
I was excited to try this , as I 've had raccoons knocking over my garbage and recycling cans for weeks this summer . I followed the directions and applied lots of this all around the area where my garbage is , even sprinkling a little in the garbage for good measure . I closed the lids tight . That same night , it was worse than ever -- garbage knocked over , trash all over the side of my house . By the time I saw it , there were flies swarming and birds picking through it ... meaning that I guess flies and birds do n't mind this repellent either ! It would be one star except that I do like the idea that it 's safe and approved for organic gardens -- but it 's clearly not effective in all cases.It leaves a peppery smell in the area , and you 're advised to wear gloves while applying it .	-1
I I have a skunk that has taken up residence under my sidewalk . I tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating . It just kept digging . I covered its entrance with bricks , it just pushed them aside.Then I found this Cridder Ridder , which seems like just what i needed . I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it 's own scent ... The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced ! This may work with deer , but apparently not skunks !	-1
The major reason I wanted to try this product is that we have a strong presence of feral cats , plus raccoons and badgers come out at night as well . I have a square lot running a little over a quarter acre . One five-pound container was not enough to cover the entire perimeter , so a week ago , I concentrated it on the two borders where I have seen the cats the most . No change ; I just chased two cats out of the covered area this morning ; the product does not seem to bother them at all . In order to cover the entire exterior perimeter ( four-inch wide band ) of my lot , I would need 2 and containers ; the label also indicates that one application only lasts up to 30 days , assuming you apply it as directed , only on sunny , dry days . The annual cost for me to use this product would , therefore , be : 2.5 containers x $ 27.09 ( current cost per container ) x 12 months , equals $ 812.70 . From what I have observed this past week , it would not be effective .	-1
I had high hopes for Havahart 's Critter Ridder . I live in a neighborhood that does n't really have any public space to it , so you often find people that walk their pets and use your lawn without respecting their neighbor 's to clean it up . There are also a few pets that roam freely and have their pick of lawns . I used Critter Ridder around the edges of the lawn to create a border . Most dogs appear to have just walked over the border of repellent and continued to use my lawn . They did n't even appear to be affected by the repellent , so it would n't have helped to spread it over a larger area.I 'm sure some pets might have not like the repellent , but I definitely could not recommend this as a general purpose solution . There were too many breeds and kinds of dogs in my yard , even the very next day after using this .	-1
I have a severe squirrel problem around my house . The chew the cable line outside , they have even been in the house one year . I also have a large chipmunk population that creates other issues as well . I thought , hoped , prayed that this would work . It did n't . They are still all over . Do n't waste your money folks . I suspect I 'll have to start trapping them and `` re-homing . ''	-1
I applied this liberally around our back entrance which is frequented by squirrels , raccoons , possums all who know what else at night . While most of these critters are not problematic , the raccoons are a nuisance and empty our birdfeeders and even our hummingbird feeders . After sprinkling this product around the entire area , the racoons ( and squirrels ) pretty much ignored it . I have found success with Deer Away spray which works much more effectively .	-1
I obtained this product because we have cats and chipmunks that invade an area between our house and our shrubbery.The product is nicely packaged and easy to use . I was concerned a bit about the warning label that suggested you contact a poison control center in case of contact with skin . It was hard to believe it was that dangerous . The coverage was also less than I would have thought for five pounds , but adequate for the job at hand.The material is granular with a not-unpleasant smell . The smell was completely gone within a few hours of application.As a test , I set up a motion activated wildlife camera and recorded the area in question for about a week . I saw cats every night ( two different ones ) , chipmunks during the day and a few birds . I then applied the product.Unfortunately , I have photos of the same cats and chipmunks in the same area after the product was applied . There did seem to be fewer chipmunk visits- but the cats continued apparently unaffected . The birds were gone , but I was n't worried about them.Could be I did something wrong ( or that we have strange neighborhood cats ) but the product did not work for me .	-1
We applied this yesterday around the perimeter of our house . Today I watched a squirrel come right up to the window next to where I was sitting and dig in the dirt where this product was applied . He stayed quite a while , dug up a nut and ate it while staring at me . I 'm not at all impressed with this product and do n't recommend it .	-1
Either I got a bad batch or this does n't work . I have some young seedlings I 've been trying to protect from being dug up by armadillos and dogs . The dogs just keep marking the spot and the armadillos dig right through it . Totally ineffective for me .	-1
To test this product , i sprinkled a layer onto an area of my yard that one of my cats has taken to using as his private litter box . It 's bare dirt , dry , sheltered from the wind.I used about half of the package , which claims to cover 300 square feet , on this area that 's approximately 75 square feet . I did n't intend to overdose it so badly , but it 's very hard to estimate how much you 're shaking out over what square footage . ( In case you do n't feel like doing the math , that means i used about twice as much per square foot as the packaging says is necessary . ) Day 1 : The cat went to his new favorite toilet , sniffed around , and meandered off . I did n't see him set foot in that space all day.Day 2 : The cat went to his new favorite toilet , dug a hole , and did his business.So even at double strength , this product deterred a housecat for all of approximately one day . One windless , rainless day . That hardly seems like something worth spending money on.And speaking of money , you 're paying for something that is , by weight , less than 1 % active ingredients . That means about 0.8 ounces of this product is important , and the rest is filler . And those active ingredients are basically black pepper and a little bit of something like cayenne pepper . You can buy a 2-3 ounce container of black pepper at any grocery store for a few dollars , so why pay more than $ 20 for this ? Even if it worked , it would be a waste of money .	-1
The product label says to apply at the rate of 1 lb . per 40 square feet . Impossible to measure the rate of application and when using the narrowest opening on the spout the 5 lbs . were gone in about 50 square feet ( ? ? ? ) . If it had some color to it you could a least see where you 've been with it but as it is it blends in with the grass so well you ca n't tell . I used it to circle my peach trees to keep the varmints away and so far it appears to be helping but it will be very expensive to have to reapply every rain . I think I will look for a cheaper alternative or I will have the most expensive peaches in the country.This is a follow up to my review . It has been about 4 days since I sprinkled the product around the base of the peach trees . It has not rained but today I was watching the squirrels running through the `` protected '' area without even noticing it as they continued stealing my peaches . So much for that idea !	-1
After trying this product , I agree with other reviews that it does n't last 30 days . The price point is high for what you get . I prefer going to BJ 's or Sam 's Club and picking up a vat of black pepper and/or Cayenne powder and sprinkling it around any perimeter where you do n't want critters and it is cheaper to use & I feel safer . I 've used the black pepper before around the perimeter of our home to deter black ants and it works . We also use the black pepper & cayenne powder around our veggie garden to deter animals away . We reapply as needed , but it seems once they know it 's there , they find somewhere else to dine . I 've also used moth balls around my flower gardens to deter cats from eliminating in them .	-1
Maybe my New Mexico critters are used to spicy food ( this is the home of green chile after all ) and the capsaicin and black pepper in this product just made them want to grab some chips and dig in . I put this around 2 rose bushes that the rabbits and ground squirrels have been chewing on.The squirrels and rabbits happily snacked on my roses with this product applied liberally to the area around the rose bushes . I watched them sitting on the product , eating my rose bushes.Perhaps they tested this on squirrels and rabbits who have no taste for chile . Mine were yelling for me to throw out some tortilla chips .	-1
Package says the active ingredients irritate animals when they touch or taste the product . Also lists that the poison control center should be contacted if the products gets on your clothing and contanimation of food and water should be avoided . Because we have young children and pets , I do n't think we will actually chose to use this product due to saftey and ground water concerns . I would rather have pests dig up my lawn than end up taking our pets to the vet or the kids to the doctors for medical treatment .	-1
This Critter Ridder says it is rain resistant and then at one point in their description says heavy rain resistant . When I received it , the weather forecast had a low probability of rain for the next 10 days ; so trusting ? that , since it was the best I could do , I spread this along my problem area for dogs . We have a sidewalk with a grassy median between it and the street and several trees surrounded by hosta gardens that it 's been very irritating , in more ways than one , to find dog waste left in.The directions say to use gloves to spread it , but since the can is a shaker , it seemed much more handy to just give a shaking application that way . I spread it along the edges of the sidewalk and in a ring around the hosta gardens . As luck would have it that evening was one of those 10 % scattered showers , not that heavy of a rain . The next morning there was no trace of the granules or the smell , which had a slight ammonia odor and there in the corner which had probably gotten a heavier dose because that is also where an area the hosta are was a huge pile of dog poop.That sort of destroys my opinion of this product 's effectiveness .	-1
This is a fine tool for very light use . Unfortunately , most of the tasks you use a garden knife for are anything but light duty . After losing my many-years old hori hori knife , I thought I 'd try this , mainly due to the price . On the plus side , the grip is comfortable , and the notched point is a nice feature . However , the build quality is not at all suitable to the things I want to use a garden knife for , such as prying out major weeds , dislodging rocks , sawing small roots , and dividing dense perennial clumps , etc . The blade is very thin and it is not securely attached to the handle . Returned it and went for a more sturdy knife ( AM Leonard brand ) that works much better ( albeit at a higher cost ) . This knife would be fine for very light use in light soil . It wo n't survive anything else .	-1
I 've had this knife for about 2 years and I used it moderately to divide perennials . It has worked fine for that purpose until I used it for the first time this spring and the handle slipped off . The big-grip handle is glued to the metal shaft and the glue seems to have deteriorated with age . If you are interested in a garden knife , I would recommend something with a forged handle since these tools see some tough duty , glues and plastic are n't going to last .	-1
This is the Chinese Fiskars product line . All their shovels are made there , and I have repeated problems with their D Handle shovels . The blade is not aligned properly with the handle . The handle is cocked at an angle so that it twists the wrist when using it . I have returned several shovels to Amazon , and now I give up . And , yes , it is not pre-sharpened . And , no , it came with no PVC sleeve . If Fiskars wants to cheapen their image with this poor quality , I will be thinking three times before I buy Fiskars in the future .	-1
Bad news , made in China . Good news , well-made . Nice wide tread ( width tapered 1 '' to 1 5/8 '' ) and textured to prevent your foot from slipping off . Blade ( 6 '' x 4.5 '' x 15 '' long ) welded to the oval steel shaft . Great `` D '' shaped handle ( 4 1/4 '' x 8 1/4 '' and screwed to steel shaft ) at just the right angle for tough jobs . It is 47 '' long and weighs 4 pounds . Nicely balanced . UPDATE/CAUTION : This spade has a problem with the way the handle is attached to the blade . It is not welded all of the way around allowing water to get inside if you wash off the blade . I did this and the next time I went to use the spade it was rusty in this area . I have found Fiskars to be a good company that stands behind its products , so I contacted them . I explained the problem and they immediately sent me another spade . I thought the defect might have been an isolated problem but the replacement has the same issue . I like to take care of my tools and this rusty defect is enough for me to downgrade my rating from 5 to 2 stars . Not recommended .	-1
I do a lot of work on my 2.5 acres of southern Florida yard . Everything grows fast , even in the dry season . I use saws , machetes , cutters , trimmers , and pruners depending on the task . Pruning is a big thing for me since I had rotator cuff surgery on my dominant shoulder and swinging a machete or using heavier equipment is harder than it used to be.So I do a lot of pruning and depend on my chosen tool to be sharp , work properly consistently , and have a functional safety mechanism if provided . Unfortunately I ca n't keep this blade sharp , it seems to crush what I 'm cutting instead of sharply severing it , and the locking mechanism continually engages when I do n't want it to . Big disappointment . Perhaps it 's time for Amazon and other retailers to indicate on their descriptions where each product is manufactured .	-1
Fiskars 8-Inch Hatchet is very dangerous . You can cut off a limb or a protrusion from a hand if you do n't know how to use this . The level of training it takes to competently instate yourself with the knowledge of `` Hatchet chopping '' is about 2 years.Most people pick this up for recreational use at the local fish pond or RV camp and meet disastrous results , which result in the trip to the local hospital ward . I can not endorse a Hatchet that is so flauntingly dangerous . If you need wood , you can buy it somewhere or hire a vagrant to cut it from a forest.I implore you , Do not use this ! UPDATE : I 've documented numerous cases where the use of the Hatchet has produced a variety of injuries , ranging from simple cuts to the loss of a limb.UPDATE # 2 : Certain counties in Louisiana have banned the Hatchet.UPDATE # 3 : Many films have glorified the use of Hatchets in murder complots . Hatchet ( 2006 ) , The Baby ( 1973 ) , Hatchet for the Honeymoon ( 1970 ) , Blood Night : The Legend of Mary Hatchet ( 2009 ) , Deep Red/Hatchet Murders ( 1975 ) , and Strait-Jacket ( 1964 ) . Hatchets should be outright banned.There is even some offensive American southern metal band formed in Florida called Molly Hatchet.This is a notable abuse of an already dangerous `` tool '' .	-1

Not only did the one I got from Walmart look identical ( except for label Kelsyus ) , and cost 1/3 of the price , it is also holding up better.I bought the two at the same time and Kelsyus one wo n't hold air in the pillow.I 've returned this one for a replacement and will give the company a second chance . Kelsyus has a good reputation but the two products I have bought from them have not held up.Update after a year : I have now purchased a dozen different designs of floats and this design remains the most popular for use with young children because it 's the easiest to climb onto , particularly with waterwings ( life jacket ) . My husband also prefers this design because more of your body is in the water .	-1
I love the idea behind this , but it did not hold up well at all . The edges frayed and it started to fall apart quickly .	-1
I & # 8217 ; ve got critter problems this year and moles tend to be a constant . And as a result I & # 8217 ; m trying a few different things . My usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so I found myself checking out the ingredients . The main ingredient is bromethalin , a far cry from my inoffensive castor oil . I do want to drive them off the property , but what I don & # 8217 ; t want is for other animals to ingest it.We do have other animals who trespass and I & # 8217 ; m using other & # 8220 ; stay away , & # 8221 ; but natural methods . What I don & # 8217 ; t want is for other animals to dig for this in hopes of a nice snack . Not that I like the presence of red squirrels or chipmunks when they invade my home or outbuildings , but don & # 8217 ; t want to use this very toxic poison . Think I & # 8217 ; ll take a pass on this one .	-1
Apparently someone tipped off my mole that these strange colored fake worms may not be healthy to eat . My mole runs around happy as a lark and would not touch this fake worm with a ten foot pole . I will have to try a different method to get rid of this unwelcome guest because the fake worm does not do the job .	-1
While I seem to be in the minority , I did not love this product . There just was n't much activity on it . I put them in a high traffic area but they were left untouched . I did better with the repellent.In the end , I rolled these in a little tiny amount of PB powder and used them in a barn wall to get mice . They worked great .	-1
All I can say is that the 5 people that reviewed this product MUST work for `` Tomcat '' cause these little `` worms '' are as much of a joke as every other mole bait out there . I have used 5 boxes of these ( yes , literally 5 boxes ) and I have had NO success whatsoever . Granted , I must be a fool for spending over $ 100 on one product , but I have tried everything else and was desperate . Do n't waste your money . Not sure what else to tell you to try though , outside of making sure that your yard does n't have grubworms .	-1
Not sure these work , I bought to boxes and still have moles . If it killed any I ca n't tell . To expensive as well .	-1
This package contains six baits per pack and they are shaped like earthworms . The bait is made of mole-poison Bromethalin . I tried to use this to kill moles in my yard where there is significant traffic in the soil . The trickiest part is the proper application . I use a hard wooden stick or a metal rod to pierce a hole in the mound and detect the tunnel , and then drop a teaspoon full of poison pellets , when I am using Bromethalin pellets . Generally the holes are below the surface and the stick gives a reasonable measure of where the tunnel is . There are hits and misses , but you have to place this where moles can find it . I found it very challenging to put this into mole tunnels ( the product is very wiggly ) and finally gave up . I recommend Bromethalin pellets which are easier to handle and apply .	-1
cut the worms in pieces , crushed the runs and waited for repair , baited each hole . Waited days and checked , worm gone in some , but no dead moles , and burrows continue to appear . I have tried traps , poison peanuts , more traps , more traps , more traps . These moles seem to live close to the house foundations and burrow into the grass sod to eat worms each year . One came up and died on it 's own last fall perhaps from & # 34 ; old age & # 34 ; . Nothing seems to kill these critters , as long as we have earthworms and sandy soil and shade .	-1
I have alot , alot , alot of moles in my yard . Or are they voles ? I 'm not sure . I find little holes everywhere , and I find big mounds everywhere . Maybe mine are hybrid mole-voles . Whatever they are , they do not like Tomcat worms . Never even touched them .	-1
Not sure if I got a bum trap or what , but I have a real hard time getting my trap to set . I have other , smaller mouse traps and have no problem setting them , but I just ca n't get this one to reliably catch . It ends up being really stressful trying to set it . Not sure if mine is just defective .	-1
This rat trap is designed pretty much like any standard mouse trap . You place the bait on the designated end , you pull the u-shaped bar against the spring and secure it in place with another bar that fits into a little hole on the same piece of metal as the bait . It was n't too difficult to set up , though the spring is rather tight , and given the size of this thing , you 'll want to watch your fingers . I tested it out a few times with a pencil to see how well it might respond to vermin.The first time I tested it , it took a couple of jabs with a pencil to release the bar and have the trap close . But every attempt after that , I had to literally force the bar to move in order to get the trap to go off . And frankly , my opinion is that if the trap is not going off when I 'm trying to force it , it 's not going to go off for a rat that does n't have two hands trying to forcefully set it off . I chose not to set it with actual bait and then leave it anywhere because I did n't want it to just attract rodents without actually doing anything about them . We know we 've got something that keeps coming to the front entryway of our house , we do n't want to give it any reason to keep coming .	-1
I bought some of these Tomcat brand at Lowe 's - which look the same as the Victor brand.Little did I know that the spring/catch do n't work as well . They are more difficult to set , & so far , the bait is eaten but the trap does n't spring ( on all 3 units ) . The Victor brand works much better .	-1
The above is just a suggestion that peanut butter is better than cheese as mouse bait . The trouble is that even with the right bait , this trap is unreliable . It just does n't spring that easily . So , sadly , I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
We thought we had a rat in our barn , so this came in at just the right time ... but lo and behold , no rats in the trap . It looked like the bait was eaten a little , but sometimes we 'd find a tripped trap , but no bodies or body parts - so we 're thinking a small mouse might have tripped the trap . After reading mixed reviews for the trap , I tried some testing with a stick to see how hard it was to get this thing to trip . I got ta say , other brands I 've used ( mostly Victor , I believe ) , trip much more easily ... but it does have to do with the kind of bait you use . The purveyor of lore and cartoons will want to put cheese on a trap - but that is only effective if the rodent has no other food source ... and there are usually tons of food sources they already have access too . The bait has to be irresistible for them to venture onto that trap with your human smell embedded in the wood ... so I use peanut butter and it usually works like a charm . Rodents also tend to run along walls/baseboards for navigation with their whiskers when it 's dark - so the placement of a trap is also crucial . My experience is that peanut butter has several things going for it . It 's sweet - and rodents love sugary stuff . It 's gooey and sticky - so the critter is n't going to take the bait and run with it - they 're going to relish in their ( hopefully last ) meal as they lick the trigger vigorously to get the last morsel . Every trap I 've ever used before has tripped and killed when I 've used peanut butter . I lived in a house with roof rats and they were too smart to get into the live trap - so we had to lay out Victor traps - and boom - one right after another.So - that being said , I did testing with a stick and really poked the snot out of the trigger before it snapped . If tripped , the spring is strong enough that it would definitely do the trick - but I can see after lots of testing how people are dissatisfied with the mechanism . I did discover that if I carefully set the trap barely on the trigger , it 's more sensitive - but it can also trip as you walk out the room when you do it like this.In a nutshell , I do n't think I 'd get this brand in the future - but if you lay enough gooey peanut butter down , they should fiddle with it enough to cause it to trip .	-1
We get mice every winter . We 've tried plugging holes , sticking around peppermint and mothballs , and we have mice . We bought these traps , put peanut butter on them . The mice ate the peanut butter , the traps did not spring . They are total junk and we went back to Victor . There was a reason these were the only ones left on the store shelf when went to buy them.Jim said the problem is when it 's set the platform is high and it seems that a mouse would have problems setting it off , the trigger is not sensitive .	-1
So far , I appear to have only one mouse and I thought getting these traps through Vine would solve the problem . It has n't yet using sll four for more than a week . I practically expect a thank you note from the mouse for setting the bait out every night . Since I got these for free through Vine , I do wish I could give a better review .	-1
These are horrible . The soil clogs the bottom on the bulb so the water ca n't come out . Look cute , but they do n't work	-1
These were a waste of money . They clog up with dirt and do n't work like they claim to . I would n't suggest them	-1
Dont waste your money on on this . Use rock wool instead . I called the company asking what kinds foam is in their kits and they would n't tell me they described it as bio degradable special foam - so I called a couple of foam companies asking questions and experimented a bit . What worked best for me and is drastically cheaper is rock wool instead .	-1
This is one of the worst bird feeders I 've ever bought . It allows the birds to waste seed and the top does n't stay seated .	-1
I purchased one of these plastic rain birds about a year ago and was very pleased . It does actually work better than the brass rain birds . So now I wanted to order some more and was pleased to see the price had dropped by a couple of bucks . So I ordered 4 more but low and behold these are not the same and of course not as good . My well is set at 70 pds . and with a 3/4 pipe and one sprinkler attached I can only get 28 ft. coverage max and there are dry spots that it does not cover . All four are the same . Shame on rain bird , they are ruining there reputation . I would gladly have paid the extra couple of bucks to get the same as I had before . They seem to have the same model number as the old one too .	-1
I purchased one of these around 2 years ago at local HW place , to find out Gilmour had moved to China . Gilmour used to be very good quality , but not anymore . Apparently most everyone has gone to China and the quality of these valves has really gone downhill , but not the price they charge you . This valve is really cheap and ca n't take much pressure and it got a pin hole leak in the valve after about 2 years and I foolishly replaced it with another one , to have it blow it out six months later as it was the only Y valve the HW had and I needed another one ASAP . I use quite a few Y valves/hose splitters and 4 way splitters , so the 'search ' was on to find something better.Here is how I rate the valves now after ordering them and studying them and using them.BEST1 . Camco-Y ball Valve/ hose spliter . Made in the USA , solid , solid brass with amazing full sized ball valves . High flow . Designed to also fit RV . Commercial grade valve ! Hands down winner and same price as the Gilmour and made in the USA . Available on Amazon . This is superb valve.2 . Achla Designs . Made in Taiwan but very solid and heavy . For commercial use . Available on Amazon . This is a great valve.3 . Orbit Y ball Valve /splitter - Much thicker than Gilmour valve . And much cheaper . Made in China . Available on Amazon . This is a pretty good valve.4 . Nelson Y ball valve/splitter-Nelson went to China not to long ago . Current valves are very lightweight and not suitable for commercial use . Orbit splitters are heavier and better made . Available on Amazon . This is acceptable if you turn the Hose bibb off and have lower pressure water lines.5 Melnor , more cheap made in China stuff , quality is not as good as Nelson made in China stuff largely as Nelson is has better finish quality . Available on Amazon . This is similar to the Nelson.6 . Ray Padula- More made in China that is suitable for gardening but not commercial use . All of Rays Products are made in China and are very expensive . He 's kind of what is wrong with the USA , marketing hype and advertising then off-shoring to sweat shops and delivering poor quality and hoping you 're 'dumb ' as he rolls in the money . Ray should have gone to college to learn mechanical engineer and manufacturing and learned what it means to be an American manufacturer . Give a 'lifetime ' guarantee to try and convince you its worth the time to drive and pick up a new valve . His prices indicate he expects 2.5 valves to fail in your lifetime . Buy Camco and pay once and less and get made in the USA ! ! ! Let Ray move to China , the Chinese want made in the USA for their own gardens.WORST -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -I wish someone with an engineering background or industrial background would write these reviews , but the made in China crowd would not make as much money replacing their blown out valves.I do n't know why DRAMM does not make a Y valve or Hose splitter or if they do , why Amazon does not carry it . Amazon carries some of their high quality nozzles and hose disconnects that are made in the USA and high quality . DRAMM is the best when it comes to brass . Camco is the next best quality you 're going to find.Stay away from that Made in China stuff , we send them fake money , with Pictures of dead Presidents and they send us fake valves that break down . Made in Taiwan quality is pretty good if you cant find American or Canadians products .	-1
This powder does not work at all . I followed the instructions meticulously and it seems that ants and spiders are laughing at my face ! I assumed it would take a couple of days for the product to work so I waited . The ant `` traffic '' around my window did not diminish , no change whatsoever.I also tried this powder in a corner where we usually have spiders and they are happy as ever . So I had to go back to Raid spray ( that does not fail ) .	-1
With all the rave reviews I really expected this would work but it has not worked at all for me . I 've been using it for over a month now both inside and outside . I put it along the baseboards in the kitchen because we live in the tropics and we get a lot of ants , spiders and roaches inside the house . I left it there for three weeks , its really ugly and messy but I was willing to put up with that if it worked . I never found the first dead bug just lots of live ones so I finally gave up after three weeks and cleaned it up . I went and got new Combat traps and I found 5 dead roaches the next day ! I decided to try this on ants outside coming in up the outer wall into the window frame . Same thing , did not get rid of the ants , none of them and we have three kinds coming in . I tried it on carpenter ants living in the crotch of a tree , it did not kill them they simply moved to another spot . Did not work on Fire ants either they walked right through it and two weeks later I found them about three feet away in a new mound . I checked my doorway this morning after 6 applications in 5 weeks and the black ants were just walking over this powder without any issue , they did n't even move after all those applications ! So what does this work on ? Nothing . So far it has proven useless here , so based on my 5 weeks of using this I can not recommend it . All it does is move the bugs not kill them .	-1
I used this along the perimeter of my front door , but since it 's a powder , it scatters all over when the wind blows . I do n't recommend it for outdoor use unless you do n't mind it blowing all over the place . This product did manage to keep ants away , but I have yet to see any dead ants . The tip does n't really help with any sort of application precision ... the powder mostly comes out in poofs.It might work at keeping bugs away in areas that are n't exposed to drafts . I like the fact that it 's `` earth friendly '' but I need something that I can line my windows and doors with and not have to worry about insect powder blowing AWAY from where I need it most .	-1
Safer Brand Ant And Crawling Insect Killer , like any insect killer , is not that safe for humans and pets . It 's main ingredient is Silicon Dioxide . Should you squeeze this super fine powder anywhere in your home- just remember breathing this dust , even in small quantities , over time can lead to silicosis , bronchitis or cancer . Children , the elderly or anyone with lung issues should avoid this completely . This fine dust becomes lodged in your lungs and continually irritates them , reducing your lung capacities . If you do n't know anything about Silicon Dioxide , it 's used for making glass fiber strands , among other things , and depletes water upon contact- thus drying out and killing the insects.I personally would never spray this super fine dust in my home , as who wants any health problems that could arise from silicon breathed into your lungs ? I 'm sure it 's safer outdoors , but I prefer those little metal ant discs that work well . The ants go inside , take the bait to the nest , feast and die . I have found over the years that sealing up my home as best I can and dumping buckets of soapy water around the house works wonders . I never waste anything- after we wash the cars , the sudsy water gets dumped around the house . Soap , especially ammonia- makes bugs very ill . It wo n't kill them , but they 'll find a better place to live after getting sick enough times . If bugs are a real problem , I 'll use a liquid killer over a powder , as I can always wash my hands , but I ca n't wash out my lungs . When I read the label saying Avoid Breathing Dust and Wear A Suitable Dust Mask , I knew this product is not suitable for indoors and definitely not for me .	-1
I was disapointed to find that the reaction to this organic substance did not meet my needs.I have an ant problem in my house near where I keep my parrots.The population seemed to be less but the substance did not erraticate the ants.I am also concerned about pets that could injest poisons.Ironically a covering of table salt in the doorway and along the wall seems to confront the ants digestive symptoms and keep the pests more at bay.I used to use the typical ant traps with the poison that is spread to colony , but I am against chemicals that threaten my household pets .	-1
I figured all hickory chips are basically the same ; these prove that they 're unfortunately not.I used Kingsford hickory chips ( green/tan paper bag ) all last summer in my old Weber , and grilled up some of the best BBQ chicken I 've ever had.I recently ran out of the Kingsford , and picked up these Charbroil chips at the hardware store.I used the same technique as usual ( soaking chips , putting in tinfoil , placing on coals , let smoke for final 15 minutes ) and the flavor just was n't the same . Not bad , per se , but not nearly as tasty as the Kingsford . These chips imparted a slightly more bitter , smokey flavor , instead of the stronger hickory flavor of the Kingsford.Unless I just got a bad batch , I would say you should go with a different brand of chips ; I recommend the Kingsford.Happy grilling !	-1
This product is unnecessary when competitive products from the same company exist -- such as the Tomcat 34532 Mole and Gopher Liquid Repellent , 32-Ounce.Tomcat 's bait pellets need to be administered directly into the tunnels of the creatures . You need to be aware of the environmental impact it might have on birds , and the fact that it will be lethal to other animals , especially birds and pets . As if that was n't enough , caution should be exercised when handling the pellets since they are extremely toxic and poisonous.Why attempt to kill the creatures when it can backfire and cause harm to the humans and pets and other wildlife , when a successful repellent solution exists ?	-1
I cleared some drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard for fire prevention . The gophers that were digging countless holes in the hard dirt of the slope decided to relocate to my backyard lawn . It is & # 34 ; ON & # 34 ; , varmints ! I 've tried gopher repellents , gas bombs , traps , solar spike deterrents , and baits , with varying results . Why not give this Tomcat Mole and Gopher Bait a try ? Dislikes : *Difficulty in locating lateral and main tunnels of gophers . Lateral tunnels are plugged and concealed near the mounds while main tunnels branch out from the mounds . Both types of tunnels can be founded with careful probing but my lawn 's clay soil is too moist and usually just collapses rather than leaving a distinct tunnel . *Main ingredient is Castor oil . The gophers I 'm trying to eliminate are smart as hell and were not killed by this bait . *Unsafe for families with young children , pets . *Unsafe for the environment , e.g. , wild predators such as skunks , coyotes , or hawks may eat the poisoned/dead gophers.Results : *I followed the instructions precisely and applied the bait to fresh lateral and main tunnels that I could find . For the first two weeks , the gopher activity seemed to have ceased . *During the third week , gopher dug new bigger holes near the original mound ( gloating that the bait did n't work ) . *There was a dead gopher found floating in my pool after the fourth week . Uncertain whether it was killed by the gopher bait or just accidentally drowned while running across the backyard.Overall : Did halt the gophers for two weeks from digging holes near the original site but the damn critters simply branched out to other locations . Uncertain on the effectiveness of the bait to kill these critters fast before they have another litter . Now is the time to call a pro .	-1
I & # 8217 ; ve got critter problems this year and moles tend to be a constant . And as a result I & # 8217 ; m trying a few different things . My usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so I found myself checking out the ingredients . The main ingredient is zinc phosphide , a far cry from my inoffensive castor oil . I do want to drive them off the property , but what I don & # 8217 ; t want is for other animals to ingest it.We do have other animals who trespass and I & # 8217 ; m using other & # 8220 ; stay away , & # 8221 ; but natural methods . What I don & # 8217 ; t want is for other animals to dig for this in hopes of a nice snack . Not that I like the presence of red squirrels or chipmunks when they invade my home or outbuildings , but don & # 8217 ; t want to use this very toxic poison . Think I & # 8217 ; ll take a pass on this one .	-1
Well , I bought two of these and used as directed , and the moles just continued to destroy my yard . Save your $ 10 after shipping and get rid of your yard 's grubworms .	-1
At first I thought this product might be awesome -- the idea is that you find an active mole tunnel ( the directions tell you how to determine that ) then you use the pointy end to open a hole and then put some of the pellets into the tunnel so that the mole will eat it and die.However every time I used the product as instructed the moles never returned to that tunnel . I think this was for two reasons.First the test to find an active tunnel is to push said mounds done then check to see if they are back up the next day ... the process of using the bottle 's pointed end though also collapses part of the tunnel and if I were a mole and my tunnel had a collapsed section two days in a row , I 'd find me a new tunnel ( which is what they seemed to have done ) .Second the process of making said hole to pour the pellets into not only collapses the tunnel around it but actually blocks off the tunnel at that point . Once more the moles just made a new tunnel.Very disappointing .	-1
Wasted money . We bought a couple of these 10-12 years ago for $ 8 each and they were great tables ! Have n't had to replace them until now as they do eventually degrade in the sun like all resin/plastics do.However , THE PICTURES SHOWN HERE ARE OF THE `` OLD '' MODEL ! ! ! but what you get is a very cheap and flimsy newer model . The top of the old ones were smooth and of thicker plastic . The tops of these are so flimsy and thin you can see the ridges where the top is molded to the support brackets underneath.While it does n't affect sturdiness ( or lack thereof ) , the bottom supports shown do not extend beyond the legs . I mention this only to show you the difference between the `` really great '' tables and the newer `` really cheap and flimsy '' tables.STAY AWAY from these , especially if you 're thinking you are getting the same quality tables as they used to be . These are nothing more than a cheap knock-off version of those old , very good tables - very sad . We 're so disappointed . Considering these were $ 10 MORE than the old ones , I was really hoping to get the same quality stuff . Fooled us this time , wo n't fool us again . We 're staying away from anything with this brand from now on .	-1
As I write this review , I can hear little critters scurrying around between the floors above my office . I have also seen mouse droppings on my kitchen counter . I baited aTomcat Snap Trapand aVictor Electronic Trapwith this attractant , and placed one trap in each area . So far no mouse has taken the bait.Up to this point , I 'd say this product is a dud .	-1
I used this with the Tomcat Spin Traps , which I received at the same time . I 'm not sure whether to blame the traps or the Motomco Gel Attractant . There are mouse droppings in the areas where I placed the trap and I 'm certain we have mice , but after almost two weeks I have yet to catch a mouse .	-1
SInce I have watched a mouse run right past a trap baited with this gel , I do n't think it works particularly well . I am still doing better with the traps baited with good old fashioned peanut butter .	-1
I put this in several traps in an area where I know rats are ( my attic ) , but it did n't attract any rats . That 's pretty much all there is to say .	-1
Some chunks are huge and some are more reasonable sized with one-inch dimensions . I found that when using charcoal lighter fluid to start the chunks , the smaller ones started quickly while the larger ones started on only one or two sides and never did ignite on all sides . For that reason , the smoke from the chunks was significantly reduced.I will not buy Char-Broil apple wood chunks again and will use apple wood chips and charcoal instead .	-1
I 've always admired the Wilton Armetale products when I would see them in stores . They are very attractive so I was excited to get this griddle and try it out.Upon receiving it , I first did a little research on the types of metal used in the production of this piece . I was a little concerned with the use of aluminum which I try to avoid for health concerns . I decided to try it out despite my concerns because I figured this would be used occasionally and not daily.It fit right on 2 of my burners . I made a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches using plenty of butter . They stuck horribly to the griddle . It was quite a job to remove the stuck on food . This was just the bread itself sticking too and not cheese which is odd , I 've never had a problem with bread sticking to my pans , especially since I used butter . I also tried making saut & eacute ; ed onions and peppers with plenty of oil . Again , horrible sticking and cleanup was a bear.I 've decided between the use of aluminum in the product and the sticking that I 'm going to use this as a large and very pretty trivet and tray . I 've found it nice to place on the table and set dishes on . I also sit it on my counter and place a lit candle on it.Pricey for just a tray or trivet but it is quite attractive . I recommend using an old-fashioned cast iron griddle . You ca n't beat them .	-1
I have tried using this griddle to prepare several different types of dishes , but I have yet to have a single dish that did not stick to the griddle and make a mess . And since you can only hand wash it , the mess is even more a problem to remove.As one of the other reviews said , this is better used as a serving dish or the keep food warm , I can not recommend this griddle as cookware .	-1
This is more rant than review , so appreciate it for that , or not.Toro does not sell parts to fix these , nor for the previous 51598 model . The idea is to throw them away after a season or two ( two in my case ) . This is not right and it is not appreciated at all and makes the device NOT RECOMMENDED even though it works well . I will check out a Sears blower because they have parts and nice parts diagrams . Maybe there are others.Mine was the usual smoking motor . Electrical motors have been around for a long time now and there is no excuse for making one that only lasts a few running hours . Simply just cheaply made junk . Do n't blame the Mexicans who assembled it , they are n't responsible for the engineering or specifications and just put it together as well as anyone else could have.The CEO probably got a bonus for this . Let me do my little part to maybe prevent a couple of sales.This is disgusting and no amount of blowing power makes up for it if the company sucks.You have to wonder what other cute surprises this company has for you in their other products , even the big ticket stuff . You can assume this is an indication of what they chortle about around the boardroom table when they are passing out bonuses in a circle.Read all the reviews of those who have dealt with their service centers . There is a pattern there , one of essentially ripping off the customer and then treating them poorly . At least they should be gentle.I certainly suggest you keep looking and at least consider another brand . ********************************* Update****************************I took the blower apart to see if I could fix this before I tossed it . The smoke was not coming from the switch as it appeared , and what others reported , but straight from the motor . I used light sandpaper to clean the armature and also the end of the brushes . It has since worked perfectly for many leaf-blowing sessions , even at full power . Maybe there was some sort of manufacturing debris or chemical on there that caused some sort of resistance or simply lit up . Anyway , not too hard and saves you some money and you do n't have to throw it in the trash .	-1
I bought this to do vacuuming up of mango leaves . I have no desire to blow things around so I wont assess that . But for vacuuming , the suction is n't very impressive . Only small nearly dried out leaves get readily vacuumed in . Larger leaves or leaves still freshly green are too heavy to be sucked into the tube . So in the end , only about half to 2/3 of the leaves at any given time get sucked in . Unless you like the unfinished look of only half your leaves being picked up , the rest you will have to rake . What 's the point of the machine if you still need to rake . I do enjoy its feature of chopping up the leaves into fine particles so it saves on bag disposal and for that I may use it upside down just to feed large amounts of leaves into it for waste processing . But otherwise , the motor seems too weak for massive suction . I realize the limitation on a 15amp circuit can only allow an electric motor so much power , but still this product seems way overrated to me .	-1
Ok , I purchased this Hose on July 22 , 2013 . I received it on Saturday 24 , 2013 . Is light and it looked like it would last . I liked that it has Lifetime . The hose was leaking and bulging by August 18 , 2013 . I always made sure I empty it after each use . It does get partial Sun , not all day nor does it get Sun on the entire hose at any given time since we have two backyard trees . Amazon was great and when I called them on August 19 , 2013 they immediately shipped a replacement . I figured , all manufactured good can have a percentage of products with factory defect , no harm done . The second Hose arrived on August 20 , 2013 . On September 4 , 2013 the second one exhibit the exact issue . Called Amazon and they refunded my money . I do n't think two defective Hose in such a short time is a fluke and I 'm tired of packing a hose to ship back every month . I will now go back to doing research . In the mean time I have to water 14 planters,10sq feet of garden area with two , 2 gallon watering cans , let the fun begin . Last , I thought of contacting Gilmore but , if this were to continue I would be out around 5 bucks every month to ship the ends to Gilmour not to mention the hassle .	-1
I really liked this grill cover when I got it . It was attractive and felt heavy duty . I used it gently to try and preserve it for more than a season , but unfortunately that did n't matter . I got a large tear on a corner within 1 summer , and a 2nd smaller rip by the second season . I garaged my grill from October-April 2 years in a row , so this never saw anything more then rain showers . I 've patched the tears up with gorilla tape on the inside , but I 'm really bummed that this did n't last longer , especially with one adult owner who tries to make things last .	-1
This *was* a well-made grill cover and though the smallest size was too big for our grill , it served us well for the first year . After the first summer , it started fading pretty badly ; the bottom color is now a purple-ish color . After the 2nd summer , I noticed tears on the top , towards where the handles are . Now on our third year , there are multiple tears and the `` fabric '' has become brittle and tears easily . For what I paid for this item , it should have lasted longer . Each time we remove and replace the cover now , it tears a little more . So , expect to only get about two years out of this before it starts tearing ( if you look at other reviews , you 'll see they have the same issue , too ) .We do store our grill and cover in the garage 4-5 months out of the year , too.Would not recommend . Will post pics later today .	-1
Initially , like many of the reviewers here , I was ecstatic with my grill cover . The quality , features , and heft of this grill cover is impressive out of the box . Unfortunately , you get about a year from this cover too -- two years if you are lucky . And I 've own two of these covers so I do n't think it was a fluke.My environment though is more extreme when it comes to sun damage . I live in the Phoenix , AZ area , and my grill sits in direct sunlight for about 75 % of the daytime . We do n't get much rain here , and a few of the 2-star reviews felt that the rain caused the demise of their grill cover . In my case , I think it was the brutal AZ sun.I also read a few other reviews where they noted their cover still looks good . Well , other than some fading , so does mine but do n't let that fool you . You have to look up close and see that the interior water barrier is no longer holding and will make cracking sounds as you move the cover . This may lead to water spots or rust on your grill of course . The cover also weakened and will start to rip once it gets to this state . Finally , and more concerning to me , there is a residue power all over the grill cover ( both outside and inside ) after two years . I do n't know what it is . Does it have PVC in it from the PVC undercoating ? Is it getting in my food and in my lungs ? I do n't want to risk it any longer so it is going in the trash.I can therefor only recommend this grill cover if it is n't in direct sun or direct rain for most of the time .	-1
In my experience , it always takes a few days before for the birds start eating from the newly hung feeder , and this feeder was no exception . It is the second feeder in my front yard , the first being a Brome . And so far , the birds still prefer the Brome to the No/No feeder . The No/No feeder has very little rain protection for the seeds , as the mesh part , where the seeds are , is completely open.Also , if purchasing this feeder , it does not include a hook to hang it in a tree , just the handle on top of the feeder . **Edit Oct 3 , 2013 -- changing rating from 4 stars to 1 . The seeds stay piled up in the middle of the feeder and do not slide down to the tray or sides without help . So I finally removed it from the tree as I find it to much work to keep shaking the seeds down . And I really dislike the fact of taunting birds with seeds just out of reach .	-1
I like to consider myself an educated woman , heck I build furniture in my spare time ... but it took me the longest time to figure this thing out ... and I ended up leaving it laying in the corner of my deck when all was said and done . First off do note that you 're only getting the black wire/metal portion ... you 'll need to supply your own actual flower box , plan on something lightweight ( like those plastic ones ) and personally I 'd keep it to the 24 & # 34 ; . This just is n't all that sturdy and even if you 're lucky enough to have a railing it actually fits I feel like it would n't take much weight . We have an older wooden deck and the top portion is really thick , the only way I could make this would be to sort of bend it , maybe attatch extra bolts , I really just could n't work my mind a way to attach it that looked & felt like it would work . In comparison I bought two of these last year CobraCo English Horse Trough http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NKYWO0/ref=wms_ohs_product ? ie=UTF8 & psc=1 and they were super easy to install and even came with the liners so I did n't even need a box , I just had to add dirt and plant my flowers . They were left up all year and still look brand new . I 'd recommend spending a bit more and going with something better . I think this will end up in the trash .	-1
Parlez vous francais ? ( The instructions are - only - in French ! ) Once you figure it out , you are left with a wire extendable contraption that is quite flexible . It struggled to not flex when I put in a ceramic window box - forget about filling it with heavy damp soil and plants ! Note : The flowerbox itself is not included - just the black wires shown.It is probably best for those cheap plastic window boxes you get at HD . Not for higher end ceramic or heavy wood window boxes .	-1
I was surprised when this arrived and it was only the metal support brackets . From the original title , I was expecting a flower box with the adjustable brackets . The directions included were useless to me , and the pictures were n't much help either.The completed project was a rather flimsy bracket that tips forward from a 4.5 & # 34 ; railing.I can not imagine this bracket holding much weight . Perhaps fake flowers , but not potting soil !	-1
First of all , the instructions came in French from a company in Pennsylvania . Go figure.This was very confusing to put together notwithstanding the french instructions and the pictures that did n't help at all . Once I figured it out , it would NOT stay put on the deck railing . Had to use fish wire to hold it flat . Part of this brand new box showed signs of wear and was discolored . It did the job with some 'fixing ' on my part.This is a lot of money for something this poorly made and lacking any kind of quality control .	-1
Parley-vous ? All of the product info . is in French , which may be why it is temporarily unavailable . Perhaps they 'll get a translator and reprint the instructions in English.Consequently , you pretty much need to guess how to use it , based on the illustrations . I was interested because it 's supposed to hang over the deck railing , which it seems to do , but there are also screws and holes , which suggests that it may not be sturdy enough on its own . Since I picked it out specifically because I do NOT want to drill holes , this is not reassuring.The metal supports seem surprisingly flimsy . It 's better than dollar-store quality but not by a whole lot . Yes , you can hang it , add a box ( would n't it be great if the box could be included ) , fill it with soil , etc . but I just do n't feel confident that it will hold up without bending out of position over time . I would suggest the lightest possible box and the lightest possible soils -- -perhaps even a bottom layer of foam packing peanuts just to fill up the space without adding weight . You would definitely want to make sure the box you choose has excellent drainage , because rain would also add more weight to this.Bonne chance .	-1
Despite being & # 34 ; adjustable & # 34 ; , there is no good way for me to mount this on the rail surrounding my deck . ( In case it matters : I have a 2-by-6 horizontal top rail , with a horizontal 2-by-4 rail centered below and parallel to it , and 5.5 inches separating the top of one from the top of the other . ) The thin metal rack has adjustable brackets to fit a variety of top rails , but then there is no good way to stabilize it ... it just hangs loosely on that top rail . The rack includes an extra metal section that seems to be for stability , but my railing is such that it wo n't actually connect to it . Probably with some extra pieces of wood , and maybe some tools to bend some of the metal on the holder , I could make it more stable , but I would rather not go to these lengths for a flower box holder.Without some stability , this can barely hold anything except the lightest of flower boxes.I think CobraCo has some quality products ( I have a copper fire pit from them that I really like ) , but I do n't care for this at all .	-1
I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product . The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense . If it was that easy , there would n't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening . But I do n't buy a dedicated germination kit . The standard seeding kits available for $ 3.00 are fine . I have one I like for the windowsill , not because I love the brand or soil it contains , but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL ! ! That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly . The cost is ridiculous and , if you really want to heat your seedlings , then put an electric blanket or throw under them . You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $ 20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket , the seedlings start a bit earlier . And if in a colder area ( basement/attic ) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear . But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area . If you want a smaller area , fold the blanket . Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70 , but your environment may be different . Do n't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate , these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money . If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you ca n't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window , then get a heating blanket and a grow light . Much cheaper in the long run .	-1
This bird feeder is very attractive in the yard , but it is a little of a pain and messy to fill up . Once it 's hung though , it looks great . So far the birds have n't found it , but I will keep watching and update the review once they do . *Update* After a couple days , they definitely found it and they are loving it . I just looked out and there are 4 sitting on it . *Second Update*After about two weeks of having it up , the birds are going crazy for it . I looked out today and there had to be at least 40 little ones trying to get to it . *Third Update*I ended up taking this feeder down . It was a pain to fill and a pain to keep clean . It 's fine in dry weather , but with the rain we get it just turned into a soggy mess .	-1
I was rather disappointed in the Bird Scare Tape . Within two days I had birds trying to carry the tape off . They would get it in their beak , then try and fly away . It did n't provide much of a 'scare ' to the birds .	-1
I really wanted to like this valve , it 's made in the USA and the construction is much better than most of the Chinese counterparts . This valve seems to be made of high quality materials ( machined brass mostly ) and feels solid , but it has a few issues and a major design flaw.I had to return it because it would not work on any of the 4 hoses I tried.Pros : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ Made in USA+ Brass Seems DurableCons : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The female end of the valve has only a few threads , it will not fit on any of my standard hoses without leaking water everywhere . This is a major design flaw.- When the lever is in the `` On '' position , it extends out past the brass body and interferes with connecting this unit to anything other than a small diameter hose , such as hoses with padded handle areas or even Dramm 's own quick connects.- There is a warning label that comes on this product which states it contains lead and chemicals which are known to cause cancer . It would be nice if Amazon included this information in their description.- Expensive compared to similar products . I do n't mind this considering the construction and that it 's made in the USA , if only the product would work properly .	-1
This feed did not work well for me . It is more expensive than many others , at $ 2.40 a pound , but there was a lot of waste . It seems to be only Black Oil Sunflower , Cracked Corn , Millet and Milo . The Sunflower was eaten readily , but I could have bought that alone far cheaper . The snow in my yard is covered in what looks like teeny , tiny rabbit droppings ... the Milo the birds have tossed off the platform feeder . There is also more corn than i like to see . It is not eaten by many of the birds , and I always worry about corn stored in plastic developing aflatoxins and killing the birds . I will not buy this again .	-1
I usually use the Catchmaster brand traps , but saw these in the store and thought I 'd give them a try . While they have the same design as the Catchmaster ( basically a cardboard triangle with a sticky interior and a scent lure to attract the male moths ) they do n't work nearly as well . In the same cabinet , the Catchmaster trapped over a dozen moths ; the Safer only got one.I 'll be sticking ( sorry for the horrid pun ) with the Catchmaster from now on .	-1
Very disappointed in this product . Set it up according to instructions but I did not get a single moth ! I think that the pheromone lures were not strong enough and they just said forget it . Some of these `` Safer '' products are great for the environment but dont do the job well or at all.Pass on this-get a stronger scented trap system .	-1
Update 5/10/14 - after using these traps alongsideCatchmaster Moth and Pantry Pest Trap : Three Packs of TwoI am seeing a huge difference in the number of moths trapped between the two brands . The Catchmaster does a much better job in a side by side comparison . Where I might have about 10 moths stuck to the Safer Brand , I have over 100 on the Catchmaster . I will be purchasing the Catchmaster Brand from now on.We had tiny little moths that seemed to come into our home from packaged grains that we purchased from the grocery store . Once we had them , they just seemed to multiply . I did n't want to use toxic sprays or cleaners in the pantry so I was happy to find these easy to use pantry pest traps . All you have to do is fold the traps into a triangle with the sticky stuff inside and open the little dot with the pheromone ( a scent that attracts the moths ) and drop it into the trap so it sticks on the side . Then just set the trap in an area where the moths are . You wo n't be able to smell the lure , but the moths will.It takes a week or so to trap all the moths , and each trap lasts for up to 3 months . I was surprised at how many moths it trapped . We also used one in the garage near the bags of bird seed and thistle . Moths seem to be attracted to that too and we caught a lot of them in there . Two thumbs up for a safe and effective product .	-1
I read the other reviews and did not believe that so simple of a product could be so bad . This is a laughably bad product . It falls apart after one or two uses . If I owned a store I would be embarrased to sell it . If I manufactured it , Iwould do so under an assumed name .	-1
Some time ago I wrote a glowing review about this seed but the last batch was sub-par at best . There was almost no sunflower in the mix and the sunflower seeds that were there were small and dried up . The main ingredient was millet . I 'm very disappointed .	-1
This must be about 75 % brown seeds , which for some reason our wild birds wont eat . So the price is great if your birds like this stuff but unfortunately ours do n't and it just gets thrown out of the feeder .	-1
my backyard birds are picky about the grain in this mix and no birds touch the sunflower seeds which seem to be most of the mix in this bag of seeds . I have to dump out the feeder to toss the sunflower seeds and will not buy it again as it does not work for my needs to feed my wild birds .	-1
I do not buy fancy bird food - sunflower seeds and generic seed and mealworms . I usually get it at the grocery store for around this price but with one snowstorm on top of another it was hard to get to the store so I ordered it from Amazon ( I have Prime - thank Somebody ) . I have about 14 regular doves , several bluejays , a couple of pairs of cardinals , a small flock of starlings and innumerable junkos , sparrows and finches and one practically tame robin who gets the mealworms . Keep in mind , everything is still covered in snow , ice really , and they do not eat this.So this one star review is from my birds and who have given this feed The Bird .	-1
This injector has not worked for me at all . I find that it is only really useful for liquid injection and even then , it is difficult to assemble ( the parts are n't mechanically perfect ) and injecting it into meat such as a chicken breast results in a lot of projectile splatter of the marinade . Hurray , salmonella on the walls and ceiling ! I 'm giving it two stars ( instead of one ) because I hold hope that someone with greater skill could make this thing work wonders for them . For me , it 's a wasted $ 20 .	-1
This is very nice edging but if you buy it here or at Walmart.com , you do n't get the 10 stakes . Home Depot sells the same edging WITH the 10 stakes for the same price.Update - November 2013 - I 've now installed 8 rolls of this edging in my yard . It 's easy to install , and looks great .	-1
This Victor Fly Magnet did NOT solve the FLY problem on our patio and throughout the back yard . In fact , we do n't usually have a fly problem , but this trap brought them to our yard in huge hoards - some flies found their way into the trap - but most just hung around the patio , rushing inside every time we used the door . Finally got rid of the fly problem by getting rid of the Victor Fly Magnet ! NOT recommended .	-1
I live out in the country . There are n't any houses around me , just a big , huge , cornfield . The farm that the field belongs to is about 1/4 - 1/2 mile away . So , between us is just this big huge field that starts next to the opposite side of my driveway . We get a lot of flies from time to time , and it can get worse during various stages of the farming/treating of that field . I thought this Victor Fly magnet would be a good product to help make our time out on the patio a bit more enjoyable . It did n't turn out to be very useful though.It is super easy to use - you just open it , fill it with water and hang it up . So , no problem there . You do want to be sure to hang it a very good distance away from any area that you will be using , because this thing STINKS . Even if you have it placed pretty far away , if the wind blows right , you still get a nice whiff of it and your face will instantly curl up.I have had it outside for a month now . There 's maybe about 10 flies max in there . I have moved it twice to try to get the stench further away from us . The flies do not flock to it and they do not seem to be enticed by it or drawn to it at all . More so it seems they just end up in there by happenstance and not because they purposely went in there due to being specifically attracted to it.I will leave it up and see what happens . Maybe once there are more flies in there , it will attract even more flies ... or something ? As of now though , I would n't recommend it especially if you were hoping for it to help on your patio area etc because you can not actually place directly on or near your patio due to the horrid stench . You have to place it so far away that it will basically ( in theory ) control the fly population in that other area - that 's if they actually go into the trap.The idea of this thing is that even if it catches just a few flies , it helps overall because those few flies are n't reproducing . Flies apparently reproduce mass amounts at light speed , so even if there are just a few flies caught , you 're overall reducing the number of future flies by the hundreds . This really is n't an `` immediate area '' type of control like citronella candles would be , but more of an 'entire population - in the long run ' type of control .	-1
I hung this up close to the back of the house and boy did it stink of that smell exclusive to rotting trash . Because of that , I was sure that this would work , but it 's been out there for weeks now and only has about five flies in it . I find this strange , given that I had the open trash can sitting quite near it while we had work done inside the home and there were large families of flies hovering above for days.The trap is easy enough to put together -- fill it with water up to the line and make sure the lid is sitting on it right so that there is room for the flies to fly in . The string it hangs on it long enough to put on a branch.I think the sticky fly strips work better than this .	-1
The short of it is that this trap was used for at least 2 months using peanut butter as bait and it did not catch a single mouse or rat . I 've read that others have had far more success , but it did n't work for us.The batteries are nearly impossible to get into the unit and there the switch does not tell you if the unit is on or off . Because it 's not clear whether or not the unit is powered up , it 's potentially dangerous , as you could shock yourself.Because this unit did not work for us , I can not recommend it .	-1
To repeat what others have said , the battery compartment is terrible ! The curved top has grip ridges that are useless , I had to pry the top off.Once inside the battery holder defies imagination , curved plastic meant to hold the batteries impede the insertion of the batteries which barely fit in the plastic holder that is n't even the same piece of plastic of the `` trap '' .This really does look like a hobbled together prototype ! Following the prototype model , wires inside the trap are exposed , if a rat found this device unarmed , I would expect it to be disabled due to chewing on the exposed wires which are connected to the shock plates.The trap entrance is quite large , an adult can easily insert their hand , perhaps making it easy to clean , but also seemingly dangerous if there is enough of a shock here to kill a rat . However , this seems like it would be effective for chipmunks or squirrels as well..There is no bait holder , you simply smear some through the large holes on the opposite side . These holes are actually large enough to allow a mouse in which could explain why some user report bait loss with no kill.It is also not very apparent that the trap has been triggered . tiny , dim blinking led ? Great idea , so I have to get into the small area to check or pull it out daily ? Opportunities for improvement:1 ) Battery cover2 ) Battery holder3 ) exposed wires in the rodent area4 ) I would make the shock plates removable for cleaning , with wires hidden under the plates soldered to something that would make contact with the plate when installed.5 ) Needs a removable bait holder for easier cleaning6 ) Smaller grid on non entry side ( or bait in center with dual entry ) 7 ) Personally I would add flap doors to each side that would make the apparent entry smaller , rodents are more curious about entering enclosed spaces with the smell of food inside , the large open end is not ideal.8 ) Audible beep , like a low battery smoke alarm , should be used to identify either low battery or after the device has been triggered and needs to be checked .	-1
To call this a trap is being very generous . It arrived in a fairly thick cardboad sleeve which turned out to be of much higher quality than the trap . Included were 4 `` C '' cells and a packet of Jif Peanut Butter . The top of the unit has a curved plate with several shallow ridges which presumably are intended to assist in removing the plate to insert batteries . The plate defied removal since the surface is slippery and the ridges are not deep enough to enable a firm grip . With the use of a miniture pry bar the plate was eventually removed . Out of curiosity , the plate was reattached and removal was attempted again . No luck to do so without the assistance of the tool . Apparently the intended method of removal is to squeeze the sides of the plate and it would just lift off . That did not work with this unit nor did any other method that was tried . None of the other reviews mentioned this problem . Interestingly , the bottom of this worthless item falls off very easily.Anyway , back to the top . Inserting the batteries was not the normal simple task because the design of this unit is to make battery insertion a chore . After completing the battery insertion task it was time to try out this alleged trap . Recently I had the crawl space encapsulated and the workers removed two dead rats who met their demise due to some rat strips I had placed previously . I thought that it would be better not to have to touch the dead rats by using this trap . I placed the peanut butter into the trap , turned it on to check the green light blink , held the bottom from falling off and located it where the dead rats were found . When I later checked on the trap I noticed that the peanut butter was gone and the trap was empty . I had some jars of peanut butter in the kitchen so I reloaded the trap . I did this for several days with the same results.This trap is nothing more than a feeder for whatever type of rodent or other creature has a fondness for peanut butter .	-1
I followed the directions to a tee and I have yet to catch a single critter.The idea behind this trap is great ! Allows for fast and easy trapping with little to no mess . A true `` No Touch '' design . Just dump the critter out and you 're done.The issue seems to be that the rodents do n't like it/completely avoid it . Not a single nibble on the peanut butter or ANY of the baits I tried.So I either have no mice or unwanted rodents ( doubtful since the TomCat bait I set out gets nibbled on ) or this thing is a complete waste of time , effort , and money .	-1
I have to admit that I was really looking forward to receiving this contraption . I have a lot of suet and bird seed stored in a shed in my yard that mice have been continuously getting the better of . I have used a lot of the old fashioned traps that work ok most of the time . But the idea of zapping the little buggers and then just dumping them out quick and easy like appealed to me . Unfortunately this new space age take on an old theme leaves a lot to be desired . I have to start by mentioning the horrible battery compartment that other reviewers here have well verified as being , ... Well , just horrible . It fools you at first look that it will be easy for its right on top of the unit . However once you start trying to insert the 4 c batteries included , you will find it a total exercise in frustration . I had to eventually use a screwdriver , as well as in the end ask for the aid of my son in holding down the batteries already inserted in order to get them all secured . Its horribly tight , cheaply made , and I challenge anyone to get the batteries in this thing without using some very colorful metaphors . Once armed and hot , the instructions are pretty simple . Load bait , place , dump the dead rat . The first night that I used it , I caught a mouse , and continued too on and off for several hours . I would say that about one time in three either the trap failed to work , or some scholarly mouse found a way to get to the peanut butter bait from behind without entering . But this traps lack of a total kill ratio is not my major complaint with it . I think its a great idea that this model merely represents an early prototype of . First up is the electric shock that some other reviewers here re portably got while loading the batteries . That did n't happen to me , but the fact that it happened at all to anyone else is totally unacceptable . I have used tasers and stun guns of all kinds in the past , and have never once suffered an accidental shock while just handling the batteries , or the outside of the unit . This trap is very cheaply constructed , and the fact that some reviewers got a shock from it shows that either it is poorly insulated overall , or that the quality control on the unit is most lackluster indeed . There has also been a couple of stories in other reviews of traps arriving with a wire exposed , or the casing misaligned , and some just quitting altogether after a very short amount of time . Overall I feel this trap needs either another look at its design , or at least some much better quality control . I judge it unacceptable the way it is.A couple of last points worth mentioning . Although it should go without saying , this thing is an absolute no no to be used around crawling infants , or any little kid that could just comes across it and finds it fascinating . If this trap is able to detect a mouse or rat entering it , I ca n't imagine it having any problem with mistaking a small hand or arm probing around its innards , and thus activating its shock . A very painful one for a youngin ' to be sure . Finally , the brief instructions instruct you to insert a little peanut butter inside one of the bottom holes of the plate in the rear . This metal plate is not removable at all , and thus over time would have to be cleaned by your sticking your hand inside the unit and scrounging it out manually that way . Very inconvenient . Also , a couple of times the peanut butter disappeared with no mouse inside the unit , and I do believe that they managed to get at it through the back , without the trap actually malfunctioning from inside . A really bad design flaw in my opinion . All in all , I find this trap very poorly made , somewhat dangerous , not well thought out in its design , and finally too expensive in my opinion for what you get . My suggestion , pass on this deal and look eleswhere ...	-1
UPDATE -- After a few weeks , we had n't caught anything , and the 4 C batteries were dead . Put in fresh batteries and tried it again . Two weeks later , the batteries are dead again , the food bait is gone , and I give up on this contraption . Great idea , but it just does n't seem to work.Whether you live in the country , suburbs , or city , eventually you will be faced with a rodent problem . We 've had issues in our crawl space . We first used cheap traps . Unfortunately , they were difficult to set and sometimes only maimed the poor critters . We then purchased a scary looking trap that did the job . However , it was so gross we ended up throwing out the trap and all.We are now using this device in the crawl space . We have n't caught anything yet , but we are sold on the idea that we do n't ever have to touch the rat . Although expensive , this seems to be the best solution .	-1
We tested 7 different products over 9 months , and came out with a clear winner ( traditional Victor trap ) .We did n't catch a single rat in the Victor Electronic trap - but I suspect it 's because we were catching Norway rats that are pretty big , and we suspect the electronic trap is too small for them . There are many reports here of this trap working - we wonder if users would have caught their rats faster using the traditional Victor , & also we wish the other users would say what kind/size rats they are trapping.We baited all the traps the same ( the Victor web site has great advice if you need more information on baiting & identifying the type & quantity of rats you have ) . Also , we rotated all the traps , so the rats had an equal chance at each trap . Additionally , the Victor Electronic successfully trapped/killed crickets , so we know the basic principle works.Results : *Victor Old Fashioned Rat Trap- 8 Norway Rats ( caught 8 of 9 ) *Tomcat Rat Snap- 1 Norway Rat ( caught 1 of 9 , but did NOT kill it - maimed it , and left a bloody mess everywhere . This one gets an extremely reluctant recommendation , only if your rats are trap-shy around wood traps ) *Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap- Zero ( O ) * D-Con Baitbits - Uncertain - They ate this but later were caught by a trap . These take 3-10 days to take effect , but then the carcass can wind up in a wall , under a floor , etc . Uncertain how much of a dose is necessary to kill a large rat such as a Norway . Probably would have worked by itself , but traps are preferred so you can measure effectiveness & dispose of carcass properly . *Tomcat Block Bait- Zero ( 0 ) * D-Con Rat Glue Traps - Zero ( 0 ) - This might work for mice , but an awful idea for rats . Just makes a mess - avoid ! *Tomcat Old Fashioned Wood Trap- Zero ( 0 ) , but the rat steals the bait every time . Tomcats do NOT snap . Just like a real Tomcat we once adopted - he would find rodents and play with them , tease them ... but not kill them . I even whacked the trap with a broom handle and it still did n't snap . Makes you wonder if the rat designed this one ! Hope this helps - thanks !	-1
The reviews for this seem to indicate that people either love it or hate it.I 've had bait stolen out of this trap so many times , and not one dead mouse/rat . I 've changed the batteries , moved it around , tried different bait , etc . Nothing.I love the concept of this trap , but the quality/efficacy seems to be hit or miss .	-1
We have an intermittent rat problem in my neighborhood . It 's partly intermittent because one of the neighbors puts down a lot of poison . As we have pets , this is not an option.We tried this trap on numerous occasions . The set- up is pretty easy . We never caught a rat or anything else in here . Could be they were too smart or could be the neighbor got them all ... but it did n't work for us .	-1
looks like it will work ... came with batteries ... came with a little bit of peanut butter ... the 'blinken light ' came on when turned on ... but , but ... after careful placement in line with an observed path , not a single rat after several days of hope for giving a single rattus rattus the chair ! on the other hand , my three $ 2 glue traps nailed five over two nights , with two two-fers ! those dirty rats ! they must have known what what waiting for them !	-1
This pool rake is sorry quality and does n't last . It did not last even one pool season . In fact it broke after 2 months of use . The netting is OK but the plastic frame is weak and broke rendering the tool useless . Do n't waste your money !	-1
I 've used this a few times now in an 18 ' above ground pool . I am able to clean the pool well enough with this pool rake . If held just right , it does a decent job of picking up the settled debris . I do not have any trees close to my pool so I do n't have many heavy leaves to contend with as most pool owners do . However , even with my smaller-sized pool and only light debris to pick up , I will be amazed if I can get through one season with this pool rake . It is very flimsy and the net is not attached well to the frame . It 's cheaper than many pool rakes but I 've had better rakes in the past which cost less . This pool rake does n't begin to come close to being a professional type pool rake or resemble anything near being heavy duty . I am having to be overly slow and gentle moving this rake through the water .	-1
I have been using a bag-type skimmer ever since we got the in-ground pool . I thought this style would be handier ; I could scoop up some leaves , swing around , and deposit them outside the pool area . Not so . The skimmer does n't capture many leaves , or anything else , at all . Maybe I do n't really know how to use it correctly , but it does n't work for me .	-1
Well , the price is OK , but while I expected some of the ladybugs to be DOA , it looked to me that out of 1500 about 300-400 came dead . I will look for local suppliers in the future .	-1
I received the package late , the package was dumped upside down next to the door , and after refrigerating them for a day , i found the majority of them were dead . I would say under 100 actually survived to be released . Not very happy with this at all.After doing a little research ( a little too late , but whatever , i found you can order them directly from High Sierra , which you can find online . Again , that is High ? @ @ # $ # Sierra ) . Most of the distributors apparently purchase from them first , so why not avoid the middle man ? I will be ( no shipping costs either ) .	-1
I hate to gripe about this purchase as I enjoyed releasing the few ladybugs that I did receive . Suffice it to say that I hand-released most of these little ladies and was done in under an hour . There were a number of ladybug corpses , but still only about 100 or so . I do n't know what this company is doing when it comes to parceling out these bugs , but they need to find a new method.As for what the bugs did after they were released , well that is n't the company 's fault . They do tend to wander off . Still , I keep seeing ladybugs near the release location and there were only about 100 of them to begin with . I feel like the few bugs hanging aroundI 'd make a stink about being ripped off if I thought 10 bucks was worth the aggro . Still , this is definitely a case of `` buyer beware '' . Go try your local nursery for bugs if you need them , that way you 'll be able to see what you 're getting before you shell out the money .	-1
Item arrived fine , worked great out of the box . Difficult to get the smaller bugs as they seemed to fly through the racket , or get pushed by the breeze created from swinging it . Seemed better to let them fly into it than try and hit them . Worked great for about a week . Then dead . No reason for it to be dead , just dead one day . Changed the batteries - was n't the batteries . It either shorted itself out or the internal wiring came loose . Really wish it had held up , but poor quality turned it into an expensive toy for a short life span .	-1
I had my first chance to try this today , killing a wasp that got in the house . A bit of delicate task , considering we 're allergic . The Executioner failed miserably and definitely did n't live up to its name . It did n't even stun or slow down the little bugger , let alone injure or kill it , despite multiple direct hits . In the end , a rolled up magazine combined with a squish under a shoe took care of the wasp.But further investigation showed the `` Executioner '' to be totally useless . I tentatively touched it myself and felt nothing . Full hand on the metal ; still nothing . Changed batteries . Again , nothing . The only thing this does , as far as a I can tell , is turn on a little red light in the handle to make you think it 's working . Big , fat waste of money .	-1
We have had this tiler for a few years now and since we were moving , just stored it until we were moved . So , moving aside , we drug this thing out and guess what ? It worked for a little bit then quit . It would n't restart , and then the motor started smoking ! What a ridiculous machine ! SO wish I would have saved the money on this thing and bought the other tiller that 's the Number 1 seller on amazon . This thing is a total piece of junk ! And , I 'm now out the $ 330 I paid for it . Brother !	-1
We purchased two of these . We were excited to get them quickly and we put them together with no problems . We knew they were n't going to be the highest quality , but we thought they would do the job . We put a total of 6 small plants ( herbs and vegetable seedlings ) split between the 2 greenhouses . We also put things like our small shovel , empty watering can , and bag of soil on the bottom shelves . There is no recommended maximum weight listed on the product listing , the box , or the directions . We figured we should be okay since we had much less than what is pictured on the box and also on the product listing here.Not even 24 hours after setting these up both crashed to the ground . Pots broke , plants were tossed upside down , and everything was a mess . It was difficult to get everything out safely since the plastic was zipped up and the opening was facing the ground . Once we got everything out , we noticed the plastic supports on both of our greenhouses broke . They could not hold the weight . That is unfortunate considering there was n't that much sitting in the greenhouse to begin with.We will definitely be returning both of these.I would n't bother wasting your money on this . We 've decided to spend a little more and get a heavy duty rack like this one : Seville Classics SHE18487 18-Inch by 48-Inch by 72-Inch Shelving System with Wheels , Chromeand then wrap heavy duty plastic around the back and sides . For the front , we are going to attach a second piece of plastic with velcro so it is removable . Same effect , but at least we can be certain it wo n't come crashing down. -- In case this review does n't scare you away and you are still curious about the dimensions between the shelves : -There is 12.5 '' between each shelf.-The top shelf has 20.5 '' of space at it 's highest point.If you are having trouble keeping the wire shelves flat across the supports , you can bend them slightly downward so they fit better . This stopped ours from moving around so much ... .well before they came crashing down . : /	-1
I bought this thinking it would be kind of cool to grow some smaller plants and flowers on but was disappointed ... Though it it was easy to assemble.For outside use- Without a sturdy background AND screwing it in for support this greenhouse design will fall over with even the smallest gusts of wind destroying all your plants ... yes it happened to me , but i was able to salvage and retransfer a few of my starts.-During the summer months if you keep the flap closed the plants will not get nearly enough oxygen and die . Also , in summer even with flap open I recorded heat in excess of 110degF causing serious wilting.For inside use- Pretty much can only be used as a display for small flowers or to start plants in a tray ( seed dome only fits in top tier ) but kind of looks like crap with any kind furniture you might put in a room.All in all- Not a good buy unless you want a slightly hideous plant display or just want to look like you grow plants in a & # 34 ; greenhouse & # 34 ; .	-1
I ca n't tell but it does not seem to kill them. , ... they swarm to eat it but they keep coming back ! !	-1
I have purchased four of these Gilmour 10 series hoses over the last three years , two are still working . The manufacturer specifies a lifetime warranty on their web page , but no-one from the company has ever replied to my emails . We have 3 hoses in the back garden , the third is a Flexon , which so far has outlasted two of the more expensive Gilmours , and it 's a lot lighter .	-1
I demand a lot out of my hoses , and in spring/summer have 2 100-foot hoses + 1 50-foot hose running from the house to our raised-bed vegetable garden.Well , I did n't even start the garden yet but had the hose fail on me . I left if on for a couple hours but had the nozzle off from the sprayer . The hoses I had last year never had an issue in this state.But after just two hours , the Flexogen hose was spraying water from the part that connects to the faucet . I 'll be able to patch it and use it with our rain barrel but it disappointed me .	-1
I went for this because of price . My mistake , it kinks and the kinks turn into squeezed shut areas that have to be worked back to open flo . Never will buy again .	-1
Although this mower works well at cutting grass and bagging leaves , the switch is very poorly designed and has broken on both ( I purchased two mowers since I have a larger yard ) mowers within one year . A flimsy plastic handle pivots on a thin plastic post , held by a light-weight spring . The plastic post degrades and fatigues quickly , and eventually breaks off at both ends , resulting in a mower that will not operate . I have not subjected the mower to unusually severe treatment , and can not fathom why an otherwise well-designed appliance should have such a poorly designed switch .	-1
I bot this hoping it would protect my feeder but the squirrels got right around it . At first they would fall off , but then they eventually figured it out . Also , in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off . Hook is lost in the snow , had to buy a new one at hardware store . Can not recommend this . Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40 , see if that works . Otherwise it is on to another feeder .	-1
I thought this would be great for our birds to feed at our window . But very few want to perch on it . Plus , it does n't drain well . After one season , the plastic discolored , and the suction cups would n't stick to the window .	-1
We loved it till the squirrel noticed it and started jumping on it trying to get to the food . The idea is great but you have to find a window that is n't near a tree with squirrels around .	-1
This bird feeder is a total piece of crap . It 's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together . Two of the flimsy connection prongs immediately broke upon insertion . I doubt the product cost 25 cents to make . Avoid this poorly made feeder .	-1
I have been using this for over a year in order to really give it a chance . I 've used it on various potted plants as well as plants in the garden . I really wanted this stuff to work but I wanted to be objective . I only used it on half of my plants of each variety to see if there would be a difference . Soil , fertilisers , care , light etc were all the same but only half got the `` Superthrive '' . ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE . It did n't seem to harm the plants but also made ZERO difference to growth , flowering , size or taste . Obviously some people love this stuff but I ca n't see why ... placebo effect ? If it was as spectacular as it claims , then why would n't it be a standard product for all commercial growers ? Bottom line for them is money and obviously they see this as a waste ... as do I .	-1
BROKE	-1
I bought this not for the fertilizer that comes with it I use that regularly anyway and have been using the fertilizer this review is not about the fertilizer I love there fertilizer and usually I love all there products however the Garden feeder I am not impressed with and there are cheaper and better feeders on the market . I will list by number the things I found wrong with this particular feeder.1 . Pressure is not very good on any of the settings.2 . Dispenses product unevenly3 . Dispenses product to fast or to slow or not at all4 . Have to turn upside down at times to get product to come out even after it is mixed really well5 . The setting spin on the front the dial does more harm then good at letting the water out in a certain way6 . No hose or tube inside the bottle or bowl area to pull product through everything is based on how much water is in bowl.Ok to be fair these are the positives1 . Light weight2 . Arrived on time3 . Does come with Miracle product inside of it ready to go.4 . The water shut off Does work ok5 . The product shut off to allow only water to get through works OK also.As I said I love and I use Miracle grow however I am not at all impressed with this dispenser and or there liquid dispenser . For a company that puts so much hard work into a great product to help plants grow you would think they would put more effort and ideas into how to dispense the product onto the plants and not sell cheap stuff at a higher price.Two stars because it showed up early and I like that that is one star , it was packaged well and arrived brand new , that is two stars . Did come with product inside that I love and it does not leak and it did put the product onto my garden even if I did not like the way it did it so that is the third star.I finally had to downgrade this to a two star , wow I really do not like this product . It leaks now and it is not that old , does not dispense evenly , I tried my best at giving it time and seeing if I would like it but I do not.Hope this helps anyone looking .	-1
This review applies to ALL Miracle-Gro brand fertilizer-feeders , includingMiracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden FeederMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed Starter KitMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Feeding SystemandMiracle-Gro 100511 LiquaFeed Advance Starter KitI totally agree with ALL of you who have posted on the `` rip-off '' index of these products . My `` other half '' bought these one of each type at local home improvement warehouse on two different occasions thinking how easy it would be to use . She did not realize how EXPENSIVE it would be for the LiquaFeed Kits , it just looked EASY . Not only are the refill cartridges costly , the things LEAK , do n't dispense evenly and is basically garbage ! ( Maybe she has learned on 2nd time around , then again ... ) Miracle-Gro bulk granular water soluble fertilizers of various types are great ! I have never burned any plants with them ( see note below ) and have healthy excellent looking flowers , plants and few veggies . But Miracle-Gro equipment is JUNK , including this item and Miracle Gro Lawn & Garden Feeder Miracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden Feeder . They are made of BRITTLE plastic , as I stated LEAK , do not mix & dispense fertilizer well , and break easily.AVOID these products . ( NOTE : I do apply in cool of morning or after sunset here in HOT central Texas , and after going around fertilizing ALL plants , come back and `` mist off '' any fertilizer that may still be too concentrated on leaves and water plants . )	-1

Squirrels learned in a few days how to get around this . I wasted my money but you do n't have to .	-1
A good squirrel baffle actually serves two purposes being directly over a feeder . It hopefully keeps the pesky varmints that its designed to deter away , and it also serves as a roof in keeping rain and whatnot away from the seed portals and helps them stay dry . There are people that buy baffles as protection from the weather even if they are fortunate enough not to be bothered by squirrels . The Aspects dome is certainly big enough to do both jobs . But it is no more effective than any other baffle of the same size and design that is much cheaper . If one sets out to buy a baffle just about anywhere of the dome variety , they will get a swift and severe education as to how expensive they are . You will come to believe that all baffles must have uranium in them somewhere to be so overpriced . The only exception to that rule that I have come across is the dome that can be found at a local Tractor Supply company , or at the Tractor Supply website . They sell a full 15 '' gray plastic dome squirrel baffle for the unbelievable price of only $ 8.00 . ( At the time of this writing . It my be a little more now , but will forever be far cheaper than the Aspects ) . They are the same size as the Aspects and have the same double hook system . And they also come with an attachment for mounting the baffle on a pole if that serves your needs . They are so cheap and effective I ordered 6 of them at once for all my feeders . The only difference between the two is the Tractor Supply baffle is a solid gray instead of clear . Something I actually prefer since the clear ones only look clear for the first couple of Weeks anyway . From that time on they are never clear again . If you 're in the market for a baffle , especially for more than one , forget this horrendously overpriced Aspects model and check out the squirrel baffles at Tractor Supply company . You will be most pleased I believe ... : )	-1
Did n't like it , returned it , it did n't work at all . I trap mice all the time in the metal wire cages , and this caught nothing . Sorry , charlie -- useless to me .	-1
The hook that holds the metal bar in place does n't work on mine . I know that if I did n't have a defective trap , it would have probably worked ... but who knows with my mouse . It 's managed to set off but avoid 1 Snap-E trap and 3 ordinary d-Con wooden traps . I was hoping this would do the trick , as I 've had to move the food in my cupboards and pantry twice and tape up any and all openings , no matter how small and it seems to be working . I guess I 'll have to manage life with a mouse in my kitchen . I do n't want to use poison because the mouse hides in places I ca n't get to and I do n't want it 's dead body stinking up my house .	-1
Given the cost of this unit , the water reservoir capacity , and the fact that it only fits certain types/sizes of pots , I think I 'm better off just asking my neighbor to hit my fussier plants with some water from my hose if I 'm going to be out of town for a week or more .	-1
The lid will not stay snapped shut , thus the suction needed to draw the water into the plant is not present . Could not get it to deliver water to the planter .	-1
I followed the instructions that accompanied this loser and the results were poor . The lid on the tank will not stay closed . I had planned to use this outside but without the lid staying shut this would be an excellent hangout for mosquitos so I left it outside for only about a week and a half . I dropped ( pushed would be a better word ) the `` hose '' through the hole in the lid . Instructions say insert it until the tip reaches the bottom . I pushed the entire `` hose '' through the hole and it never reached the bottom but remained suspended in the water about two thirds of the way down . The tank hangs on the side of the pot all lopsided and really looks as tacky as all getout . No water ever transferred from the tank to the flower pot during the week or so that I left it outside.Not sure where this was made although there is a USA address on the cardboard but it does not say `` manufactured in '' . However I would not blame any manufacturer for not wanting to admit to making this butt-ugly and worthless recycling candidate.There has to be a much better offering of plant watering products than this . Look elsewhere for something that has at least a smidgeon of quality which this does not . Stay away from this - far , far away .	-1
I have pretty much given up on the CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter . The instructions that come with the plant are basically useless , leaving the user to try and figure out how to make this thing work . It seems simple enough . Fill the reservoir with water , connect the hose , and stick the watering thing in the dirt.But it is n't that simple . The water does n't seem to flow on its own . I have tried several things , from mounting the reservoir at different heights and trying to `` prime '' the tubing with water , but nothing seems to work . I did read that there is a way to get it to work , but I had already given up at that point . It seems like if you are going to make a product that sells for $ 17 and the only thing it has to do is water a plant , that you would at least provide instructions on how to do the one thing it is made for.I ca n't give it 1 star because apparently some people have figured out how to make it work , and so apparently it is n't totally worthless . But for wasting my time , and frustrating me , I will give it 2 stars . I should also mention this thing is ugly and wo n't clip on to pots that have a thick rim , like some ceramic pots . It is also made of very cheap plastic , not high quality plastic like tupperware or rubbermaid products . Overall , this thing is not good and I do not recommend it .	-1
I held great hopes for this gadget . We have a 20-inch pot on our upstairs desk , containing a brugmansia . We needed a plant there to shade the window , but it 's a hassle keeping it watered . Perhaps this would cut down our daily watering to every other day.Unfortunately , it did n't work for this purpose . The lid to the plastic container would not stay closed , so perhaps that 's part of the problem . Also , the curve of the plastic container was n't wide enough to accommodate a a pot this size . I tried sitting the container on the ground , though , and that did n't improve the function.Judging from another review here , I might be able to use the wired device in another container . But right now I do n't have time to engineer that.Kudos to the manufacturer for the handy video instructions . Very clear .	-1
2nd UPDATE : The sensor was empty today . I thought I made a mistake the first time this happened . Since this has happened three times & the two sensors I 've been using for years still have water in them , there must be something wrong with the Plant Sitter . I noticed that the Plant Sitter feeding tube is smaller in diameter than the sensors I 've used for years . Maybe that 's the problem . I do n't know for sure , all I know is that the Plant Sitter sensor is not siphoning water like it should be.My rating went from 3 stars to 1 star.UPDATE : After setting this system up using 3 sensors ( one that came with the plant sitter & two I previously owned ) , I thought everything was working normally . After a few days I checked each sensor again to be sure each was full of water . I was surprised that the sensor that came with the Plant Sitter was empty again . The other 2 sensors were full of water - like they 're supposed to be . I soaked the empty sensor for 15 minutes then re-filled it with water . I will check in a few days to see if it is empty again . If so , I will update my review & reduce the star rating.~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEWI 've used self-watering probesSelf-Watering Probes - Package of 5for indoor & outdoor plants successfully for many years . I use gallon milk containers as the water reservoir . The CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter works the same way way as the ceramic probes I used in the past & it comes with its own 1 quart reservoir.To use self-watering ceramic sensors : ~Remove cap~SOAK the ceramic cone/probe 10-15 minutes in water ( Cobra forgot to add this important step to its product label instructions ) ~Fill the cone/sensor ALL the way to the top then recap it.~Push the ceramic sensor into the soil . I always make sure the ceramic portion is completely pushed into the soil.~Fill the reservoir with water . To feed your plants , add a little liquid fertilizer to the water.~Drop the feeding tube into the water reservoir making sure it rests on the bottom . ( For the Cobra Plant Sitter , drop the end of the tube through the center hole on the reservoir 's lid ) ~Cover the top of the reservoir so that the water wo n't evaporate & so mosquitoes wo n't get in if you 're using it outside . ( The Plant Sitter has a lid , but the lid does n't snap closed . To keep the lid closed , I put a rubber band around each side of the reservoir . If I was using the Plant Sitter outside , I would cover the center hole & the feeding tube with aluminum foil ) ~IMPORTANT : Always set your Plant Sitter up a week before you leave to be sure it 's working properly . ( I noticed that the water level in the reservoir had n't changed in a week . I pulled the ceramic sensor out , removed the cap & saw the cone was completely empty ... that 's why it was n't working . I filled it back up , put the cap back on , pushed the sensor back into the soil ; by the end of the day , the reservoir 's water level was going down ) ... see my UPDATEA few tips : ~Larger plants will need at least two ceramic probes/sensors.~Depending on type , size & season , a plant will require from 8 ounces to 32 ounces of water weekly . I find that for my plant in a 6 '' pot , the Plant Sitter 's one quart reservoir will water it for approximately 2 weeks.~If you rely on the Plant Sitter to always water your plants , you should water the plant from the top once a month.~The level of the water in the reservoir should be below the cap on the ceramic sensor . Raising the reservoir increases the flow rate ; lowering it reduces the flow.~If the reservoir runs out of water , you need to refill it & you will also need to refill the ceramic sensor.The Plant Sitter 's reservoir is a nice translucent color , not flashy or showy , so it wo n't detract from your plant . It 's too tall for some of my smaller indoor plants . So I sit it near the plant instead of hanging it on the pot.I added two more sensors & am using the Plant Sitter to water three plants at a time . The center hole is large enough for me to thread two feeding tubes through it , but I had to put the other tube under the lid ; two rubber bands are holding the lid closed . I 'm sure the reservoir will need to be filled often , but the plants have been so thirsty lately that I have n't been watering them enough . I 'm expecting happier plants by using the Plant Sitter.Amazon 's product description is confusing to me . It mentions both a 1 quart reservoir & a 2 quart reservoir . I received a 1 quart reservoir & one ceramic sensor.Made in ChinaThis is a 4 star product , but I deducted 1 star because an important step was not included on the product 's label instructions & the lid does n't snap closed.~~~~~~~~	-1
I tried this in my guest room , where I have a few plants that get forgotten . After following the directions , I put this into a pot of Emerald Gem that had been recently divided from the mother plant . It was doing great because I was remembering to water it.This watering system did n't work well . A month after installing , there was still water in the well . The plant was very droopy . I 'll try again with a different plant and see if I get better results .	-1
Although not a bad concept , and upon seeing it you think , `` Why not ? I 'll give it a try , '' this item works better in theory than in practice.You ca n't really rely on it to keep your plants alive . I think another review said you had to siphon the thing first . That kind of takes away the `` automatic '' idea . Maybe my expectations of the product were a little too high , and my review sounds a bit harsh , but when I see automatic , I want something truly automatic.Not only that , the system is a real eye-sore.Maybe plant sitting technology is still in its infancy and hopefully it will improve in the future . I 'm glad to see other users were able to get something out of the product . I wish CobraCo the best of luck and hope they can some day live up to my higher expectations .	-1
This is supposed to be a hummingbird feeder , not a nectar fountain ... ... . It IS big , and once assembled , it looks attractive . It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers , which kept popping out and flying onto the floor , but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive , looked very nice.Adding the cylinder , which I had thankfully filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup , was an unwieldy process , But I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place , and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers . Had it been dripping out from under ONE of the flowers I might have been more forgiving but ALL the flowers were leaking . Nuh Uh -- I just installed a new balcony rug and there is NO way I am going to hang that on my balcony.Like some of the other reviewers did , I will disassemble it , and GLUE the flowers on to see if THAT helps . If that does n't work then this product is waste of everyone 's time .	-1
I do love the size and the 6 ports to feed from but I can already see it is hard to open and fill and get closed right again so it does n't leak . I do n't really expect this to last more than this season . Do n't get this size unless you have a lot of hummers coming because you should refill your feeder and clean it once a week so if you fill it full and do n't have enough hummers to use it up there will be a lot of waste . If you do n't need that much just fill it half full . You can always add more if needed but be sure to clean your feeder every time you put more syrup in it for them to drink.You really need to push firmly on each piece as you put the feeder flowers on and the center parts . If they are n't on right they will just fall off so you 'll know if you did it right or not . The stand for the hummer feet are on securely because they have little cut outs for them to fit tightly before screwing them tight onto the feeder . Just take your time putting these features on so you do n't break them.UPDATE : The little yellow centers in each flower that are snapped in independently are coming off . The Orioles keep playing with them and they are coming off even though I had them on securely . Now there is an opening large enough for any bird , fly , wasp , etc . to get into the juice . Not a good thing . When this is empty I wo n't use it again . Spend more and get a nice glass feeder , they are the best .	-1
The best thing about this feeder is its huge 48 ounce capacity . If you 're looking for something you can fill up and then forget about for a long time , this may be it . Otherwise , it 's all plastic and looks cheap . I 'd invest in a smaller glass/metal feeder instead .	-1
I was skeptical because there are too many parts and openings . The more openings and parts the more chance for failure.The & # 34 ; flowers & # 34 ; have to be pushed into holes and then the yellow centers inserted . The hole you push the flower into is failrly big and over time the plastic becomes brittle and leakage begins . My hummers seem to like the smaller feeders ( which are made by Perky Pet ) I think a little more & # 34 ; design tweaking & # 34 ; is needed . The smaller feeders are simpler but work better .	-1
Update 07/19/2013 : Well , the cage has failed . My moderately-sized tomatoe plant has already proved to be too heavy for this cage . The tomatoes are just getting started and the tomatoes are going to be about medium-sized . One of the horizontal rungs has already sunk under the weight of a few of the branches and now I have an unsupported tomatoe plant.Super easy assembly and well-packed . Adjustable arms are a nice feature.I do have some doubts about how well it will support my full-grown tomato plants , but so far , so good . These stakes do have some give to them - I 've seen these sold before with out the side arm supports - they are a plastic/resin type material with a wire down the center.I assembled mine BEFORE I put them into the ground - no problems there . The side support arms are easy to move around , if needed . This cage can be taken apart at the end of the season for easy storage , unlike the metal cages which take up way more space to store.I 'll definitely report back at the end of the growing season . So far , no complaints !	-1
I was very disappointed in this purchase . It 's my fault because I should have read the description in more detail . This is like a plastic erector set , and not very sturdy , and really not very good with tomatoes . It worked somewhat better with my peppers and onion plants , but not with the tomatoes . I would never recommend this product to anyone .	-1
I 've been a tomato gardener for 20 years now , and support means everything . This `` cage '' might be good for a determinate tomato , but for an out of control , constantly growing indeterminate variety , especially with large fruits , this will be useless.First off , this item came ridiculously bubble wrapped , and was extremely frustrating to get undone . I managed to break off 3 snaps , rendering 3 of the supports useless . Is that my fault ? Yes , but in my defense , the bubble wrap was so tight and glued , and was n't easy to open up.The stakes themselves are too short , 5 ' and `` Strong steel core stakes '' is laughable at best . These `` Strong steel core stakes '' are the same stakes available at Home Depot , Lowes , or any local nursery , and while they 're okay , `` strong '' is not a word I 'd use to describe them . You want strong , get rebar.I ended up putting these `` Strong steel core stakes '' around an obelisk that I am using for my cucumbers , which fit perfectly when I attached the 2 remaining rows of the supports together .	-1
For the price I paid for these I expected them to do very well holding my tomatoes , well they do n't . I expected them to hold the tomatoes up nice and straight , but they sprawl all over the place and have to be attached to the cage . I do n't feel they work any better than wooden stakes or the wire cages and are not worth the price I paid for them .	-1
I moved from a ranch to a condo , and needed to start over with my approach to vegetable gardening . I knew that I would be starting with an heirloom tomato in a City Pickers box , and when I saw this tomato cage offered via the Amazon Vine program , I grabbed it.Because it takes a while to see the longevity of a product that will be in the sun most of the day , I ca n't comment yet on the durability of the product . Let 's just say that I am a bit skeptical about the cross pieces lasting longer than one season , as it they are constructed out of plastic . The uprights are constructed out of steel coasted with plastic , but they are rather lightweight.PROS : The tomato cage was easily assembled . I had it put together and in the box in no time . The design is very clever . I like it a lot better than the wire tomato cages that are metal cones ( seeGalvanized Tomato Cage 33 '' X12 '' -3 Ring/3 Legs ) which I have found to be flimsy and easily bent out of shape . ( At my previous residence I had the most success with homemade cages assembled from leftover field fencing supported by metal fence posts . Field fence has generous spacing between the wires . ) CONS : The directions say to put the cage about 8 - 10 inches deep into the soil . That does not seem very deep if one expects to support a large tomato plant . I had no control over the depth that I had to set mine in , as it 's in a box . ( see product images ) I get the feeling that once my tomato plant gets to a large size that I am going to need to fasten the cage to the balcony rail to keep it from toppling over . But , that 's speculation at this point.I know that this review is incomplete at this point , and I do apologize about that . But I do intend to post updates throughout the upcoming growing season . Stay tuned for further developments ... .Three stars for now , as I am a bit skeptical about how well this cage is going to work out.UPDATE : June 4 , 2013I have had the cage in place for a month . I must say that my opinion of this cage is slowly sinking in the west . I had to add a row of string as an additional support for my young tomato plant . I also had to fasten it to my balcony railing with zip ties , as even a moderate breeze would send it leaning to the side . I decided to anchor it down before it tipped over and took my tomato with it . See product images.Final opinion : A waste of money unless you have some way to support it .	-1
The materials that this Aerator was manufactured from , were worthless . I took it out of the box , and went outside to stir my compost pile . Two days ago , I had removed the sticks , which had mixed into the vines , leaves and such that were in the pile . This left me with about a foot of well degraded plant material , mixed with dirt , and random fine roots . I started to jab the pointed end into the pile . However , the wings which are suppose to fold down and then stir the pile , simply stayed up . I would pull them down manually , and when it was placed back into the pile , they 'd immediately fold back up . & # 34 ; At least the bottom tip is mixing up the mulch & # 34 ; I thought to myself . After about 15-20 minutes , I looked at the tip , which was bent to the side about 45 degrees . The cheap paint on the steel ( ? ) had flaked off the tip too.Usually garden tools last a lifetime . In fact , I have garden tools I inherited from uncles long dead , so they are lasting TWO lifetimes . Nevertheless I can accept if a garden tool only lasts a few decades . Or at least lasts a few years . But when you get a tool , and it only lasts a FEW MINUTES ? Perhaps the company changed the materials that they make the aerator from , or they changed the company that they subcontracted to mold the metal tip . If you look at other recent reviews , others have also encountered the tip bending over , or the wings that bend down so you can stir , not bending down . I hope the company fixes this problem , because this seems to be a good tool for mixing the compost pile . Unless you have a shovel .	-1
Unfortunately I 'm not able to recommend this product as it appears to have poor quality control . This arrived with a broken handle/hose bib despite no evidence of wear/tear to the box or packing . Basically unable to use in current condition and trying to find a replacement hose bib that fits to repair is n't worth the time or effort of driving across town with this thing in tow . AVOID .	-1
I have two gardens , one off of each end of the house . They need a lot of watering . It 's always been extra work adjusting the water flow from the hose . ( Walking back and forth to the house each time ) . I tried the hose `` Y 's '' which have a switch to adjust the flow at the garden , but they 're on the ground , generally upside down and are hard to adjust since the levers are very small.The Bib Extender has been placed next to the garden with the hose attached . With the faucet on at the house , it is an easy and convenient way to adjust the water flow . It is up a couple of feet and has a good faucet handle . The shaft which goes into the ground is very solid and the whole unit is simple . I did find that it is important to use a pliers to tighten the hose connection onto the Bib Extender to prevent leaks . I also find this true on the house faucets since the `` rubber '' seals are generally plastic , not rubber anymore . I have had the water on at the house for a few days and see no problem with leaking . I will just leave the water on at the house and use only the Bib Extender for turning on and off the water and making adjustments.As of May 24 , 2014 the on/off handle broke off in just normal use . The product should not be purchased .	-1
Everything about this product is well made and works well except for one thing ... The handle bar collapses too easily during use . The handle bar is a simple twist lock , much like my pruner 's bars ( which work very well ) . And if you want to have a 1/2 length bar for tilling , then this product works great . But , I suspect most people will want to stand while tilling , and the handle bar , even though well tightened , collapses too easily under regular use.So , while everything else about this cultivator is nicely made , this one fatal flaw prevents it from being truly useful .	-1
This has good use if you have a planter with soft soil but do n't expect it to do much in harder dirt . For the amount of muscle I 'd have to use to get this thing to work in hard dirt , I might as well just poke it with a fork .	-1
Maybe because the clay soil is like a rock or maybe because my moles have become highly educated but I 've not snagged one mole in three weeks . I have tunnels everywhere and holes all over my yard but no dead moles . The trap seems like a good idea and it 's well constructed but I do n't think it 's made for my area of the country . It 's difficult as crud to set with the hard soil but once set it has never tripped . I 've moved it to different locations but still no luck . The design seems like a good idea so maybe it 'll work in your area . I 'm going to keep trying and if I get positive results I will correct this review . Not recommended for clay soils .	-1
Three years ago , at the recommendation of a friend , I bought a squirrel-resistant bird feeder ( Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic ) . It worked so well that even the heavier bully birds could n't feed from it . I have all kinds of birds who feast from this feeder , so I decided I should get a second one . This Perky Pet feeder became available , so I was happy to give it a try . It is much cheaper than my other one , and the difference demonstrates that you do indeed get what you pay for . The squirrels figured out how to get into this one pretty quickly . So did the starlings.This feeder has a nice design , and it looks like it should work just fine . It has a spring mechanism that pulls down the plastic shell over the feeder holes when something heavy sits on one of the perches . Unfortunately , a couple of the feeder holes on this model are high enough that the squirrels just have to hang down from the top of the feeder - without putting weight on a perch - and feast away . I do have this on a tall metal shepherd 's hook , so *that* deters many of the squirrels . And I have considered covering up the higher feeder holes to keep the rest of them out . I certainly would n't recommend hanging this from a tree or post or anything that squirrels can easily climb . Because of where I placed the feeder , most of the bird seed is actually going to the birds , but it 's not because this feeder is squirrel-proof .	-1
I have many styles of bird feeders all around my yard . This seemed like it would be a pretty addition ; one that I thought would look lovely outside my window . I loved the idea that it closed when something heavy landed on it . I have other feeders that do this so I thought that this would be made the same way and react to weight the same way as the others.It did NOT . When anything heavier than a goldfinch landed on it it would close -- -and STAY that way . At first I thought I just had very stupid birds - they would land on the feeder and then hop around like they were looking for a port they could eat out of . But when I went out to see what was wrong , I saw their dilemma . They just could n't find a port because the whole thing just closed and stayed closed.It was this way not matter how I adjusted the springs.I do n't want my feathered friends to starve , so I will be taking this down right this minute .	-1
I like the look of the feeder . It 's attractive , and I really love that it holds over 3 lbs of seed . It was good for about a week and a half . After that , the squirrels chewed at the plastic , just making the seed openings larger , and the springs stopped working consistently . The idea is great , the execution just needs a bit of work . Our dog , however , was overjoyed , as it became the popular neighborhood bar for the squirrels . He loves chasing them and got a good workout daily . Made the dog and squirrels happy , the birds were less than enthused .	-1
Although I purchased this feeder at a local Ace Hardware store several weeks ago , I stopped putting seed in it ... I was only feeding the squirrels . Apparently , here in Florida , the squirrels must be too light-weight to close the feeder , ( I 've taken several photos ) , and the birds ( Blue Jays and Cardinals ) are too large to stand on the very small perches and bend their heads into the cups ... it 's too difficult for larger birds and they fly off . It would probably work well in an area where little Finches flock !	-1
I would have rated this feeder a `` 0 '' or - 1 star if available . I bought this feeder about 9 months ago and should have taken it back then . The birds liked it at first , then stopped feeding from it even though it was 3/4 full of seeds . When I took it down , I saw that the remaining 3/4 of the seed were wet and matted together in a moldy `` brick '' . It took about one hour to `` clean '' it and clean up the mess in my kitchen . Neither the lid nor the base is removable for cleaning , so there 's no way to remove and clean the seeds from half way down to the bottom . To prevent the squirrels getting the lid off , it 's designed to pull up a little way and tilt to the side for adding seed.If you turn the feeder upside down to shake out the old seeds , the lid ( spring mechanism ) pops back in place . That does n't really matter because the seeds are wet and compacted into a brick anyway . I had to push a 13 '' screwdriver into each port and try to loosen the seeds while running hot water through the top ( cold water did n't work ) . I must have used 10 gallons or more of hot water and ran the garbage disposer the entire time I was attempting to clean this horrible `` feeder '' . I bet it cost me $ 5 to clean the feeder.It 's impossible to reach downward with a screwdriver to force the seeds loose , and you ca n't clean it because you ca n't get a brush in vertically . It 's a HORRIBLE design . Once I flushed and poked most of the seeds out , I soaked the feeder in a big bucket of soapy water , then flushed it again . I still did not get out all the old moldy seeds.Since I could not get inside to dry it , I had to set the feeder on the floor near a heat register for THREE DAYS to dry it out . The birds left my yard and it took a couple weeks before they came back.After all that work , I decided that the wet seeds must have been a fluke -- perhaps the result of a heavy sideways rain or snow . So instead of returning the `` feeder '' , I filled it again . Duh ! ! Within a week , the same thing happened . I took it down.It 's been 9 months since I bought it , but I 'm returning it to Lowe 's tomorrow.This bird feeder is readily available for $ 19.99 at ANY big box store , yet online stores still try to sell it for much more . This feeder is n't worth 50 cents EXCEPT ... for the fun of watching the squirrels try to get the seed . They can not , and after less than a week , they gave up and went away . After that , I could n't even use the feeder for fun.Buy a Brome feeder , and buy a 16-18 '' diameter clear dome to hang over the top . It protects the birds from the weather while they eat . Of all the feeders in my yard , birds prefer the one with the dome . 10 '' and 12 '' domes do n't protect the birds or the ports.UPDATE : I never complained to Woodstream Corp. about this feeder . However , Woodstream saw my review and a Customer Rep. sent me the nicest letter ! She said `` Your comments concerning the design and experience cleaning this model feeder have been shared with our product development team . '' I believe Woodstream genuinely cares about customers and making good products . To make up for my inconvenience with the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder , Woodstream sent me a Perky-Pet 337 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder as a replacement . It has three tubes so I can use 3 different kinds of seeds , and the lid comes off by unscrewing a large knob on top . Much easier ! I did n't like the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder , but I LOVE Customer Service at Woodstream Corp. ! ! It 's top notch -- more than a 5-star rating . THANK YOU , Woodstream .	-1
Well , although it works like its supposed to ( so far ) when a squirrel climbs on it , the squirrels jump on it to swing it and when they jump off , the spring loaded gizmo pops back into place and seed falls to the ground , giving the squirrels what they want.You also need to hang this up much higher as its on the long side and some squirrels jump from the ground and climb up it . I also do n't fill the feeder to the top because its way too heavy and the way i have it hung really droops the rope making it hang too low.As for the construction of the feeder , its just a matter of time before either the springs rust and do n't slide up and down anymore or the tiny pins the springs click into will fail . Even when this happens its still a nice large feeder that plenty of birds can share . I honestly do not think that there is anything out there that truly keeps the squirrels away .	-1
It 's an interesting design but has a major flaw : The feeder tube is plastic and squirrels chewed through it in just a few weeks . Now the seed just pours out and the feeder useless .	-1
When I germinate seeds in peat pots , I put the pots in cooking trays and keep some water in them which effectively becomes a self-watering container . The Jiffy pots held up well . These basically fell apart when I tried to plant the germinated plants.I would not use again .	-1
I have used the peanut butter Suit cakes from this company with great success to the point the birds fought over it , HOWEVER this Suit DD-24 melt into a blob in 90 - 100 degree temperatures we have been having and the birds take one peck and leave it for seeds . Now I 'm stuck with 11 more of these things.If my birds become active ( I 'll give it another 2 weeks ) with this I 'll update and make an edit but right now it 's thumbs down and I should have ordered more of what worked before ( peanut butter suit ) .	-1
The metal detector I received is n't what I ordered . When I go to the orders page there 's no Seller Feedback button to contact Amazon to find out what I have . The area where the model name/number is usually placed is blank and the only indication of it 's identity is where & # 34 ; Bounty Hunter & # 34 ; is printed on the face of the control box . The Owners Manual says Quick Draw II BUT the face of the control box is n't the same as the Owners Manual or the pictures of the Quick Draw II on Amazon , Kellyco or Youtube videos . I do n't know what I received because it does n't have a model name or number on it and Amazon does n't have a seller feedback button on my & # 34 ; Orders & # 34 ; page to contact the seller . It may be an upgrade from the original model I ordered but so far I ca n't figure out what I have . The control box face is the same as the Pioneer 202 but the name is n't on the face . Looks to me like they repackaged a bunch of stuff and sent it without thinking about the Owners Manual not being the same as the model they sent . I 'm a little irritated with Amazon for not leaving me a way to resolve this issue . The product may in fact be OK but I 'd like to know what the product is and get the correct Owners Manual for it so I can adjust it to it 's best performance .	-1
It appears to just randomly beep ! Sweeping the same area gives different results very time . No volume control , so when it beeps its very annoying.I tried to locate some buried copper wires without success . They are buried 1 foot deep and this thing missed them and then beeped in other areas doing one pass but not the other . I even went over an area that had the clear line of where the ire was buried , and it did n't beep once.Yawn . Waste of time .	-1
I really dont know what to say about this detector . Thats because I never had a chance to use it . After unpacking it , I find that the face of the detector is cracked . I decided to see if it work , to get an idea if I wanted to replace it or just get a refund , it did nothing but hummmmm . So I cant really give a honest review on the workings of this detector . The packaging was standard . Cardboard box with slots to hold the detector in place . So I dont know if the box was dropped during shipment or if it was packaged that way . I have nothing but high marks for Amazon , so Im hoping it wasnt package with the equipment broken.Ive decided to buy one around my home town , so when I do , I will come back with an update . Till then , keep shopping with Amazon .	-1
Before I start this review , I do need to preface it with the fact that I ordered this from the Warehouse deals section here in amazon . It was used , so I do n't know if that is a factor or not.That said , we had to return this saw . It never did cut through anything at all . The chain kept falling off , no matter how many times we put the thing back on , it just would n't stay on . Even took it to our neighbor , who is quite the handyman to look at and well , his opinion of it - you really ca n't say those types of words here ! I suppose if we reordered it again , new this time , that it might be different . I 'm not taking a chance , however , and I 'm ordering the McCulloch here on amazon instead . We 've had 50 years of success with their chainsaws and well , guess I should have ordered that one in the first place.My purpose for writing this review is a bit of a beware if you 're ordering something like this from Amazon 's warehouse deals . They do n't check them very well sometimes when someone returns them and you can really wind up with a `` dud . '' Something as dangerous as a chainsaw can be , that could be quite worrisome . I 've had other items from the warehouse that had mismatched parts and after I returned them , they put them back online for someone else to buy ! Brother ! Just be careful , sometimes you really get what you pay for , or do n't , in this situation .	-1
I really so wanted this to be a 5 star rating , but ! I ordered this after the snows of last year to be ready for the new year snow . I only needed it now because some neighborhood boys made me an offer I could not refuse and they shoveled me out the last snow.But the Mid Adlantic storm hit us hard in Jersey and I could not get any takers so I dug out my new machine.I bundled up with scarf and hat and I was ready.I was so excited to try my new toy.I pluged it in and nothing ! ! ! Not even a whirrrr . Nothing.I changed outlets , a different cord still NOTHING ! ! I had to shovel what I have 'cause another one is coming tomorrow , urgh ! I took it back to our local place I got it from and asked if they possibly had another , no.There were 5 standing in the corner , dare I ask ? They all did not start and were going back I am not too angry , in fact I am going to try again since I believe it is a good product in general.If I hear anyone mention that granny ( that is me ) should not use this because it is heavy I will scream . They can come to my house and try out how heavy it is to shovel 2 feet of snow with a hand shovel . I know I would have to shave the snow blah blah blah , but I know it would be a lot easier than what I just did.Do n't even mention condos ( been there done that ) and nursing homes ( will never do that ) , I can probably shovel faster and longer than any youngen ' : ) If I get another one that works I hope I can up the rating , I am happy it works for most of you . Happy shoveling	-1
A twin-barreled blower/vac ... . switch between functions on the fly ... it sounds great , does n't it ? It sure does ! I took the plunge . I have a 1/4-acre lot with 6 maple trees , in a neighborhood full of full-grown trees of various species . I am also on a cul-de-sac , on a sloped property , with terraces and walls , and a privacy fence . I have a *ton* of corners and crevices that suck up leaves every year.And every year , I haul out a rake , a mower , a trash can , and a corded blower ... multiple times . My usual routine is to rake leaves onto lawns and mulch them in . A great mulching mower makes short work of them.I bought this unit thinking it might speed up my routine , and be an easier way to suck leaves out of corners , and allow me to bag mulch for easy , targeted composting.After an hour 's use , I returned it.Why ? Let me counts the ways ... .1 . It 's a compromise ... a blower and a vacuum that does neither well . The blower is serioudly underpowered compared to the $ 30 weedeater model I have . The vacuum can only pick up smaller , drier , freshly fallen leaves , and only manages that slowly . If the material has been in place and had a chance to lock together , forget it . After the first bag full , I resorted to shoving the barrel into a pile , letting it get a hold on a ( small ) handful of leaves , raising it , and using my other hand to coaxing them in.2 . Plastic impeller ... if you do decide to try this Trivac , get the -502 model . The plastic impeller does mulch , but not terribly finely . Even at it 's slow feed rate , this unit filled it bag every 5 minutes or so.3 . Horribly awkward , and short . Typical blower/vacs have to be reconfigured . When setup for blowing , they are pointed at the ground . Use this Trivac for 10 minutes , and you 'll see why . Due to it 's design , it avoids the need to reconfigure .. and creates a new , worse problem . As the bag fills , the center of gravity shifts farther back , and in no time you 're forced to *force* the nozzle downward , constantly . I finally started holding it by the bag and/or cord . Not good design at all . The taller you are ( anything over 5'4 '' or so , I 'm 6 ' ) , the worse this becomes.4 . Storage . It 's much larger than blowers that outperform it . And has an ungainly configuration . It 's even a pain when you *aren't* using it ! To sum up , 2 stars because it does -- technically -- work . However , it 's a complete failure as a power tool . The point of a power tool is to amplify human effort . While using this , I got *less* done . Raking them and mowing them is much faster.So who is this thing good for ? I do n't know , really . It 's too large and heavy for someone who has trouble clearing leaves by other means . Perhaps if you have mostly paved ares , and a very minor leaf burden , or are very limited on green areas you can mulch them in ... perhaps . If you have to bag your leaves , I honestly think you 'd be better off renting a standing unit , and feeding them in by hand . You 'll be done much faster.Unless you have very small hands ... !	-1
Hooked up this electric fence around my garbage cans that something keeps knocking over . Figured an electrified , bare 120v AC wire would do the job quicker , but I did n't want a bunch of charred critters laying outside . Using this electric fence , I am absolutely certain that I wo n't have any charred critters around ... even if they took a nap on the wire.The system is pretty easy to setup ; it would have been nicer if it would have came with a bit more rebar for each of the plastic fence posts , as they 're kind of flimsy and you 're just supposed to bury them a couple inches deep . It 's really not very secure to begin with . Alas I hooked the thing up in a big box around 2 trash cans and a recycle bin . Nice tight , tense wire was almost invisible unless you were looking for it , and hooked up to the power box , which was hooked up to the ground ... plugged it in , and the light started flashing . BINGO ! Next time something comes to knock over a trash can , *ZAP ! *Not so much.Like any man would , I figured I should test it out . I did n't feel a thing . Absolutely nothing . I could have snorted half the wire up my nose and hacked it out of my mouth and not been any worse for the wear . I checked to make sure nothing was touching to short/ground out - everything was tense , straight , the ground was hooked up correctly ... and ... maybe I just have remarkably thick skin , I thought to myself.I went to bed able to see the obnoxious flashing light telling me that my trash can was protected . I woke up to a knocked over trash can , with one of the bags dragged over the wires , bending it quite a bit , and leaving the wires resting nicely on the cold , moist ground.And now the thing never flashes.It certainly did n't work for me . Re-stringing the wire does n't work , the fuses are n't burned out , all the connections are fine , it just does n't work . If it DID work , I think it 'd be a pretty nice little fence based on the easy of installation and price . Would n't recommend ... unless wherever you buy it has a generous return policy , just in case .	-1
Is n't the main feature of this gas can supposed to be that it cuts off automatically ? Well , it does NOT do that and I am amazed at the rave reviews others have posted . Yes , it can be no-spill , but you have to cut the gas off manually . If you expect it to cut off automatically you will have gas everywhere . This is a deal-breaker for me and the source of my deep disappointment and disgust with this product.I followed the instructions and watched the videos on the manufacturer 's site and the first time I tried to fill my edger 's tank it overfilled and gushed all over and I had to quickly release the pushbutton to stop it.I tried again on my mower and it also never shut off and flowed over the sides of the tank . This gas can is a ridiculous waste of money.I bought three of these having blindly believed the good reviews , the videos on the manufacturer 's site , and what seemed to me to be the soundness of the concept . Well , I now have some expensive gas cans that are no better than the traditional ones they were supposed to replace.I contacted the company and tried all their suggestions . These included making sure the cap is on super tight , making sure the spout is vertical down into the opening , and pushing the green button fully . Do those things and the gas is supposed to stop flowing when the tank is full . That would be great except that the gas continues to flow at an alarming rate as gasoline gushes everywhere . They do not shut off ; they never shut off until the button is released.I have three of these silly over-hyped gas containers and truly wasted my money on them . If you are expecting them to shut off by themselves as advertised , you will be very disappointed , as I am .	-1
These are great chairs , if you never take them outside , or let them get wet.Both of the ones I ordered rusted within three weeks ( see pic posted in customer images ) , so I sent one back for a refund , and kept one.The reason I kept one is because I really do love the chairs , from the color , which is unique , and a perfect match for pool water , to the comfort , which is amazing . REALLY comfortable , and I personally had no problems with the locking mechanism ( it IS very cheap plastic , though , so I doubt it will last more than a couple years if that ) .BUT , the rust ... big problem . Obviously they did n't coat the hardware ( screws and such ) , as these rust first . Next the metal to metal contact areas of the chair rusted ( they just spray the powder coating on , so this is just a poor spray job , since it IS possible to get this right ) . This is a major problem since this is all along the frame , and immediately visible.Based on recent reviews vs. first reviews , I also believe Strathwood either changed manufacturers mid production , or the manufacturer themselves changed the process , or machinery ... because the more recent reviews complain about rust quite often , but older reviews do not ( and some of those even state they have left outdoors no problems ) .	-1
This is a trick for grill owners that also works well on this unit.My grill has lasted years as a result of the trick , so it works , but it is debatable that you should have to do this with an `` outdoor '' recliner . In all fairness , the description does state `` the recliner is not meant to be left outdoors year round in all weather '' . The thought is you will put it away when done , and not too many people will recline in rain and snow.You should also realize that the chair is a reclining chair and is relatively light weight . It will blow away in a strong storm . My deck chairs are quite heavy in comparison . So , I would not leave this out intentionally.However , if you are like me , you occasionally forget . And the next thing you know , the chair is drenched by a thunderstorm.So , apply the grill trick . Apply a bit of petroleum jelly to the joints where they move . It helps make them move more smoothly and it protects them from water . WD40 is a cleaner faster trick also used on grills . I use the petroleum jelly trick on screws on my grill and not one has rusted . I use the WD40 on the surface periodically and that works remarkably as well.I have accidentally left the chair out in rain several times over the last two months and there is not a single sign of rust.If you do leave it in the rain and have not applied the trick above , as soon as you can , spray it down with clean water from your hose and leave it in the sun to dry . If your tap water is heavily mineralized , though , this may not help for long.I want to thank those that posted reviews warning me so I could deal with the problem.And I want to say , this is an incredibly comfortable chair.But from a quality perspective , I can not give it above 2 stars because of the rust problem . A slightly more expensive set of stainless steel parts would make the chair unbeatable . Other chairs , however , appear to address the problem with plastic , and those break.What is is . I have to live with the fact I bought this chair , so the fix makes it unlikely the days I do forget to store it , that it will rust .	-1
I have reviewed a couple of other mouse traps ( the green plastic Smart Mouse Trap & the Havahart 1020 ) which work perfectly - this trap sat in the same garage where I am catching a mouse per day with the other traps , and its caught nothing in months . It is a novel idea that I appreciate as an engineer , but mice avoid it .	-1
I want to start out saying that anyone that wants to save a mouse is borderline retarded . They are disease carrying vermin on the bottom of the food chain . When caught by a fox , cat or other predator , they are slowly torn apart live or chewed live . Setting one loose in the woods thinking you are saving it will likely do one of two things . 1 . Sentence it to a much more violent and cruel death . 2 . Allow it to breed so you can have hundreds ( yes , hundreds ) more in its place . And many of these will find their way into homes.I tried these traps along side much much cheaper glue traps and snap traps . The glue traps and snap traps were effective . Not one of these caught a gosh darned thing . When placed adjacent to traps of other types , they never touched the bait on the door entrance and never went in , but were snapped or glued instead every time.The mice choose the death traps over and over in favor of these useless pieces of plastic junk . And now that I have them , they will likely end up at a local dump for 50000 years before they break down.Nice .	-1
Useless product -- did n't work for me at all . I trap mice all the time in the metal cages and thought this would be a good alternative , but never caught one critter . Sorry , charlie .	-1
There is nothing to secure this to the grill . It blew off during our recent storms and into neighbors yard leaving my new grill exposed . I went to Walmart and purchased a cover for a Uniflame grill which fits and has velcro straps .	-1
I bought a Summit and it has two of these lights on the handle . Their light is too weak to be of much use . Better to get a gooseneck , attachable version .	-1
I love my Weber Silver , and wanted to keep her looking like a champ . She sits outside year-round in the cold Nebraska winters , so I wanted so protection . I bought this cover at a local box store and it did n't even last through the first winter before cracking and tearing to pieces . Go with the Premium - its supposed to be much more durable . That 's what I 'm buying after I finish this review ! Good luck !	-1
Sorry , but this did not rotate smoothly . It squeeked and chunked around at an uneven rate and just did not work on my relatively new Weber Genesis NG model . I called Weber and they said that each year the models change slightly , perhaps just a few centimeters which may prevent attachments from fitting correctly . The lady 's final bit of information : & # 34 ; Things are n't always perfect in the manufacturing process & # 34 ; . Many people have called attention to that ring & # 34 ; handle & # 34 ; at the end of the rotisserie . I too found it to be a terrible design flaw.You ca n't grab ahold of it to remove the rotisserie , it 's very awkward , and very hot . Sadly , I had to this item .	-1
Do not buy . The thumb is offset at a angle that makes gripping impossible . I boought some welding gloves instead .	-1
They way I cook these racks just get in the way . I would not recommend them for large rib cooking .	-1
I typically buy baby back ribs . This rack just does not have wide enough spacing . Most of my ribs simply do not fit . I like the stainless steel but not happy with the spacing . I tried widening it but not the greatest results .	-1
I ordered this to replace the basket on my Weber that had become rusted.Although it says it is the correct replacement part on the label it comes up short . Beware when ordering this product . Not sure if the mix up is on the manufacturing end or not .	-1
Having a table nearby is key to grilling . However , this table is simply too close to the grill to be useful . By way of example , I had a plastic bottle of bbq sauce that I left on this for a few minutes , and it MELTED.It is also fairly small - barely large enough for two dinner plates . The only really useful thing is that it has hooks to hang your tools . Those hooks are far enough away from the grill that the tools do n't get red hot - as they would with the Webber tool hanger.Also , I found that this got in my way when grilling . I like to be able to walk around the grill and get at things from different angles . This blocked 1/4 of the grill.Instead I now use a cheap wooden folding table that I keep about three feet away from the grill . Anything within two feet of the grill simply gets far too hot to be useful .	-1
I bought a Weber product so I was expecting to be impressed . Sadly these grates are made from cheap , nickel plated steel . Which means they will not last a full season without rusting and wearing away . I bought 3 of these as replacements for my Weber gold , performer , and one for a drum smoker I made . All three are rusting badly after a couple of months of use.If you want quality and a long lasting grill grate , you need stainless steel . I called Weber directly and they do have a stainless steel grate for about 20 % more than the cost of the cheap , nicklel plated steel grates . I am much happier with the stainless replacements .	-1
This item was something I was anxious to get . But after receiving it I was a little disappointed . Extremely small ... smaller than expected . the first time I used it , the handle jammed and when I tried to extend it the couple inches that it does extend , it was stuck . I dont like this item at all and would not recommend it . Go to the nearest hardware store and buy a small camping shovel . Does much better at 5 bucks or so .	-1
No way I would ever cart this with me on a camping trip . Portable ? Carry it disassembled and assemble it at site ? That is a crazy idea : Four foot-long panels with 12 nuts and 12mm bolts . You 'd need to carry a ratchet wrench also , because the tools provided are tiny and hard to work with . I do better with rocks found at the site , and when I 'm preparing a campsite , I have better things to do than screw together 12 nuts and bolts . Bothering with something like this on a camping trip kind of defeats the purpose , does n't it ? Maybe there are camping locations that require a fire ring , but I 'm not sure this would qualify as a ring that could contain a fire : The sides are very low . When you consider all the pierce-work , the sides are less than 6 '' tall , and that is not tall enough to contain flame and sparks.This fire ring is made of fairly thin gauge metal , so it is flimsy . Placed on its side , its own weight and gravity turns the 36 '' circle into an oval . A hefty falling log causes the ring to move and shift.I was hoping to use this in our yard to grill the way the Argentinians do , ( check outSeven Fires : Grilling the Argentine Way ( Hardcover ) ) . So I needed the metal to be strong enough to hold up a grill grate or a sheet of iron ( kind of like an Argentinian chapa ) , but it definitely is not strong enough . There is no reinforcing for the sides and even putting pressure on it with my hands causes it to bend and wobble.It is nice looking . The horses look like horses . It is stylish . There is good coverage of the powder coating on the metal . But that is all there is to say positive about this ring . There is nothing else to it . Why bother ? Natural flagstones are easy to find , less expensive , nice looking , and can be moved out of the way to remove ash .	-1
My son was so excited to get this for backyard marshmallow roasting and could n't wait to try it out.I knew , from reading the description , that this unit did n't have a base , but I was a little shocked to get it in multiple pieces that needed assembly . And , while assembly is n't difficult , the resulting ring feel fairly flimsy and extremely lightweight ( this would definitely blow away in the wind , easily ) ... At least when taking into account it 's supposed to safely contain something as potentially dangerous as fire . It also was n't very stable and even , which is worrisome . ( Metal slightly warped/out of alignment , making the bottom not level . ) The metal top also bends under ANY weight , even a propped poker.Still , that all being said , we put it on a rock base , got a few logs and tried it out , and it did work , for the most part . The many cut-outs that go almost to the bottom of the ring , seem like an odd choice ( again , given fire ) and we had quite a few sparks and even some flaming kindling pop out of them , making me , as a mom , kind of nervous . Not to mention that while this is a very wide ring , the sides are quite short , even ignoring the cutouts , so your fire has to be absolutely tiny to be `` contained '' by this ring , meaning to roast , say , marshmallows , you have to stand about a 1/4 '' from the ( hot ) sides of the metal ring in order to reach the fire that 's either way in the middle or else much , much too big for the ring to contain.My main complaint is that , if we dug a small hole -- even just 6-8 '' down -- and lined that with rocks and sand , it 's be a much more protective fire pit than this is . There might be scenario in which this is a better solution , but , for backyard use , I just ca n't imagine what it might be.Also , in terms of portability , even after our one use , this is n't something I 'd want to be hauling/carrying around as it got quite sooty and dirty . Ca n't imagine packing this up in an RV , or anywhere else , where you 'd have to handle it regularly . You 're far better off finding 8-12 large rocks at a campsite and using those . You 'll actually get more protection that way than from this ring .	-1
This product gives me nightmares . Unlike the mostly successful Rat trap from Tomcat , this trap does not kill the mice but maims them instead . Whereas the rat snap trap would have an occasional rat that would get caught in with a paw instead of the entire body , this trap does n't actually have enough power to kill the mouse . This means that you will have to do the job yourself if you catch a mouse in the trap . To add to that , the mouse in the trap will be bloody , in pain , and in a lot of shock from possibly being stuck in the trap for hours.This is just not worth it . Stay away !	-1
Unlike some traps , these are very easy to set . You squeeze them like a clothespin and they lock in the open position . You really need something sticky like peanut butter to bait these with , as there is only a small spot to place bait , but something like cheese or fruit probably wo n't stay in place.I do n't know if it 's the traps or theMotomco Mouse Attractant Gelbait that I used , but I have caught no mice with this trap even though I 've seen evidence that they 've been around.Based on my examination of the trap , I am not too impressed with the build quality . I would be leery that these traps are strong enough to actually kill the mice.I will keep trying these , and will update if I have any new information .	-1
Either we have a smart mouse or none of our traps are any good . I 've seen the mouse in our kitchen and my husband saw him in the den . There are mouse droppings in the pantry . Ick ! So I was happy to get a couple of these traps to evaluate and review.First thing I did was snap my finger while trying to set one . It did n't draw blood so I got over the shock of it pretty quickly . We baited the traps with a combination of mouse attractant ( which has worked for me before ) and peanut butter . Ten days have gone by and we have not caught the mouse.In fairness , our other traps have not caught him either . I have live traps ( mouse cubes ) set up along walls in three rooms , a couple of plastic traps of a different model , and a couple of old-fashioned wooden traps . They are set with various popular types of bait . None have caught this mouse.I am not at all impressed with this trap .	-1
Pros and cons:1 . If baited correctly , these do work . It took a lot of trial and error until we learned to make a peanut butter and bread paste and press it firmly into the bait area of the trap . Why does this work ? The mouse has to tug on the bait to get it out . This does set off the trap.2 . But there was a HUGE problem for us , even if we caught any mice . Much of the time the traps did not instantly kill mice ! This meant that we 'd hear the gruesome sound of a poor mouse , unable to get out of the trap , and probably suffering a great deal . Most recently , a mouse was caught behind its head and somehow managed to keep breathing for the better part of a day . We discovered this after first seeing the mouse in the trap and assuming it was dead . We were in a hurry and decided to throw it out in a few hours . To our horror , the mouse was actually alive in a few hours ! It had n't managed to get out of the trap but it was definitely caught and unable to free itself . We had to put it out of its misery before disposing of it and I never want to go through that again ! 3 . In our first time using the trap , a mouse was firmly caught by one leg and part of its body . Like the other mouse , it tried to free itself . After two instances of having traps catch mice but not instantly kill them ... well , this was more than we could stand . We do n't want to live with mice but we want them to die as quickly as possible.I do want to caution people against buying live trapsHavahart 1020 Two-Door 10-by-3-by-3-Inch Cage Trap for Mice and Rats . Yes , these catch mice while alive . But if you do n't put the mouse in a car or truck ( still in the trap ) and drive far enough away , you 'll have those same mice returning to your home , spreading germs and potentially serious diseases ( you can do a search for those diseases online ) . Another trap that was a pain to use ? The NooskiNooski Mouse Trap , New Design Reusable Ring Trap , Safe , Clean , Easy . Unless you are willing to deal with the frustration of trying to get a strong rubber band in place , this trap is more trouble than it is worth . If you check it out , you 'll see a video that makes it look simple to use . It is not ! It has one advantage : it ca n't hurt children and pets.I have n't found the ideal mouse trap yet . The older , wooden ones have the same issue as the Tomcat one : they catch mice but do n't always snap over the mice heads , killing them instantly . Maybe there is NO trap that is 100 % effective , even when it catches a mouse . Suggestions , anyone ?	-1
Of all the Tomcat products , this one has to be the worst . If it works at all , it tortures the poor mouse victim . If you 're a sadist into torturing little animals , this is for you . If you 're a decent person , get something that 's more humane to take care of any rodent problem .	-1
I 've had these out for several weeks and they 've been licked clean once and then left alone for about a week after re-baiting them with peanut butter . I really liked how easy these were to set , but they do n't seem very easy to trigger . I put these in the barn along with 3 other traps ( the 3 way victors ) and caught 4 mice in those . I like them because they are designed to be reusable , but so far that has n't been necessary .	-1
I really like the Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap version . . . powerful , easy to set , and well-designed for a reliable catch/kill . I looked forward to good results from this Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap , and in fact had a ready test subject targeted , as my daughter had been reporting a mouse intruder in her 100 year old Victorian home with dungeon like basement . I told her to hold off on deploying her old wood traps so I could try out these just-received Tomcat Mouse Snap Traps.This mouse version of the trap was indeed , like the rat version , easy to set . Just push on the heel of the lid , and it pivots and locks open . That was where the good times ended.First problem was stolen bait . I did n't have any of the recommended `` Tomcat Mouse Attractant Gel '' in my possession , so I tried pressing on a little glob of trusty sharp cheddar . Problem is there 's really nothing to press the bait onto but an essentially smooth plastic bait/trip platform . I suspected the bait might get stolen . It was . And the second try also . By this time , I was sure the mouse would be back for try number three , as this trap was just essentially functioning as a feeding station.This third try , I fashioned a paper clip to slip over the edge of the bait/trip platform and help hold the bait in place . It worked . A successful capture this time , but . . . .It did n't kill the mouse . I was left with the task of having to put a trembling badly injured mouse out of its suffering . I felt as sorry for the little guy as I would have a suffering dog or cat , and felt terrible for having put it in this state of injury . I have trapped many mice over the years with the old-fashioned wooden Victor type traps . Nine out of ten times ( or more ) they produced an instant kill . That 's what I 'm looking for.I give the Tomcat Mouse Snap Trap a star for being easy to set with no pinched fingers , and they are indeed not likely to injure your children or pets . But I consider these traps unacceptably inhumane and will not use these Tomcat mouse traps again .	-1
After using the old wooden mouse traps for years , I discovered they just do n't seem to work as well as they used to and mice would often lick the traps clean . So , I began buying different traps to experiment and see if I could find a better trap . The TOMCAT REUSABLE MOUSETRAP was one of the traps I tried . The traps say that they offer a `` clean to-touch disposal '' whose `` patented design is guaranteed effective '' . I should have contacted the company about that guarantee because these traps do not work at all . I tried using these traps for a week . Each morning I would awaken to find the traps still set , but licked clean of the peanut butter and cheese . After trying to catch mice for a week using TOMCAT REUSABLE MOUSE TRAPS I gave up and threw the traps away . Even though the wooden traps are n't as reliable as they used to be , they at least caught a mouse eventually . These traps are a waste of money . DO NOT buy .	-1
Great looking base , but does not fit Q100 grill . Fits all of the others , but not the 100 model . Stupid ! I will probably end up rigging a base platform for the Q100 to sit on , maybe out of cement backerboard . It is good looking , and does a nice job of hiding the propane tank . Some of the nuts were n't machine right resulting in a trip to the hardware store .	-1
I have had great luck with Fiskars products except for this pole saw which has been a disappointment . My main gripe is that when the saw is extended , the pole lock ( which is a simple switch ) does not hold the saw in position . As you begin to saw , the extensive pole starts to slip , making it impossible to get the saw to work . Aside from that , it has a very sharp blade and cuts really well . Of course this only works if you do n't have the pole extended .	-1
I would n't rebuy this since my only use is for car cleaning . Even on the thickest ratio , car soap does spray out but it does n't cling to the paint . I use it sometimes to pre-rinse the car if it 's very dirty , but then always use buckets ( one clean , one rinse ) to actually clean the car . The quick disconnect is a nice feature though .	-1
This item does NOT & # 34 ; hold up & # 34 ; . . .after several weeks , it starts leaking and some of the 'functions ' do not work like when it was new . . . AND when you screw it on a metal hose end .. there is something in the 'composition ' of the female end that permanently 'bonds ' with the hose , making it impossible to unscrew ! It is like a chemical reaction between the nozzle and the hose end that cements the two together ! ! NOW , I have to cut the end of the hose off , to change out the nozzle . . . UNACCEPTABLE ! !	-1
Regarding the Gilmour brass garden hose nozzle models 528 and 528T528 ( rubber jacketed verison of the 528T ) : I bought this Gilmour nozzle first and ... It Broke ! ! ! well , LEAKS is a better choice of words ... where the shaft of the inner core mates with the base of the nozzle that screws onto the hose . They are two separate parts that appear to be press-fit togetther ! And it leaks alot ... not just drip , 2 seconds , drip..it has become a small trickle . Worse , the core and the outer twist part now spin at the faulty juncture effectively preventing the adjustability of the spray . To try and make this clearer , I can no longer grasp the long outer jacket and twist to adjust the spray , because it spins at the faulty juncture . Have n't even had it 4 months.528T : I bought this nozzle based soley on the positive reviews . Upon inspection of this nozzle when it arrived , it became immediately clear that the same 'press-fit ' manufacturing technique was used in the assembly of the 528T as in the rubber jacketed 528 . The Gilmour products that utilize this 'press fit ' manufacturing technique have , in my experience , an unacceptable failure rate , and are not the perfect hose nozzles we thought they might be ... but this one might be : Dramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose NozzleWarrantyGilmour covers this product , ( and presumably the 528 ) , with a 'Lifetime Replacement Policy ' stating they will replace the product free of charge . They do not provide a telephone number on the packaging but rather an address , and a P.O . box number at that . I have no doubt they will send you another one , 'free of charge ' . But who wants it ? Especially in light of the fact that there are better products out there that cost no more .	-1
Yes , as everyone says , it is solid brass . Unfortunately it does not have a versatile spray pattern of water as other ones of the same price.When you first open the nozzle a lil bit it will spread water like a mist ... open it more and it will spread a thicker stream in a farther distance and ofcourse it will shoot a steady stream when opened further.It has below average coverage for watering the lawn ... too strong or too misty for watering flowers ... its okay for shrubs and that 's about it.I regret buying this .	-1
We only had one critter that was bothering us and visiting out kitchen every night . We bought this trap and in 2 days we had nothing . In fact , we noticed the bait was slowly disappearing white the door was never closing . It seems that mice are too light to trip the door . What 's the use then ? We bought the metal trap and that worked . This one was mostly useless .	-1
I recently ordered several live traps because the reviews on all were mixed . The Kness Tip Trap has worked for us . Do n't remember which ones I ordered , but it appears I never received this one .	-1
I & # 8217 ; m the type of person who believes every product deserves a fair chance , boy was I wrong with this one ! Yes I admit the idea was great but it does not work.I properly hooked this up and used the supplied spike to give this the leverage I felt it needed ; I even tightened the hose securely and used the washers that were suggested with this purchase . It leaked all over the ground and left a puddle in my grass , and this was n't even the beginning of my issues.I adjusted the noodles with the water off and they still wouldn & # 8217 ; t stay bent once the water was on . I tried to adjust them with the water on and still no luck.This leaves puddles , it does not cover the areas well it just sprays in the air and hits the grass leaving a big mess . It almost seems like it & # 8217 ; s missing something maybe a mist feature ? Overall save your money with this one a buy a sprinkler . The Gilmour 196SPB Pattern Master Impulse Sprinkler on Polymer Sled Base works great for me ! I left a review for this item as well .	-1
Nothing but flimsy cardboard shoved inside cheap plastic . If you have slippers or sandles , you 'll be OK ... .. butanything more , forget it . I 'm looking to replace this piece of garbage . Save your money and put it toward something more substantial ... ... .not this .	-1
I bought this smoker and great hopes for it , but quickly ran into problems . The smoker/wood chip area comes in two parts - a holder box and a tray . The holder box was not attached correctly and where you put in the chips was not even attached to the side of the box correctly . It was at an angle . The smoker tray I received seemed to have been manufactured in an incorrect size and would n't fit in the holder . The tray also seems to have been made from very thin and cheap metal . I ca n't imagine that it would last very long . Screws were missing for the electronic controls . As a result I could n't even put it together and ended up taking it back.I guess the 90 day warranty should have been a clue , but Amazon does n't mention that fact.Admittedly this is an inexpensive Chinese made smoker , but the quality I got is the worst I 've ever had in a consumer product . I am still looking for an electric smoker , but will go for a more expensive stainless steel model . Most of these come with two year parts warranties.Buyer Beware.Addon - Masterbuilt finally admitted that I had a faulty unit and sent me a replacement . The new replacement was of much better construction and went together easily .	-1
Well first off I had a heck of a time keeping this up on the pole . I 'd tighten screws one day , come out the next morning and the baffle would be down about 3 feet . I finally figured out ( I think anyway ) that the local deer were pushing it down to get to the food , or else it was a raccoon or something fairly large . I kept tightening those screws but no matter what it would n't stay up . Second issue was that our squirrels learned to shinny up to the baffle - tilt it and then climb the rest of the way to the feeder . It was sort of fun to watch the antics BUT did n't deter the squirrels so I sent it back . Overall it was quite frustrating that once again something did n't help .	-1
I bought this last summer based on the positive reviews that it had . I was hoping for the best and this was a great umbrella while it lasted ( about 2 months ) , but the top bar snapped during a light wind gust one day . BAM ! The umbrella was open and it just suddenly landed on the table underneath it . The pole was still standing , just the fabric part of the umbrella ( where it was attached at the top center ) is what broke off . From the beginning I knew it never could be open on a slightly windy day because of blowing over . You can only have this open on a day when the air is very still . You must also buy patio blocks or some sort of weighted devices to keep it in place . I could n't believe how quickly it tipped over every day I had it opened when there was any bit of a breeze . It was not repairable and I had to throw it out before mid-summer . It did give nice shade while it lasted so I gave it one star .	-1
Originally I would give this 4-5 stars but after only a few months the stitching and material at the ends where the poles secure into already started to tear . I had to manually restitch in order to keep the poles from piercing through the material . Aside from the material the umbrella open and retracts smoothly . We 've had no issues mechanically with it . From time to time it will tip over in winds 15+mph despite the air vents .	-1
This product is straightforward . It works well if you do n't want to use the small cylinders . By using a larger propane tank ( 10lb ) I save time , money and the environment.Update : failed after 3 months use . Small round platic piece fell out of the pin hole bbq connector causing gas to leak , a serious hazard .	-1
I like the idea of this product , I have used similar , non-solar spikes in the past with great success . They seem to work but installing and caring for them is made very difficult by the solar panel on the top of the spike . It is hard to install these without being able to hammer them into the ground at some point , and the tops are way too fragile for that . We managed to get them into the ground by making a sizable hole and then burying them but that seems like it would impact their effectiveness . One of the four has already broken -- my dog hit it while chasing a tennis ball . Probably best to just go for the battery powered version .	-1
I started using this `` device '' after finding evidence of a mole in my yard , but I believe the mole left before I inserted this `` solar spike '' , so I ca n't at this point be particularly positive or negative about the product . I do plan on using it again if more moles or gophers appear this spring , so I will follow up on this review then.Review Update as of September 1 , 2013 : Having used this device for a reasonable period of time , I can attest to the fact that it apparently does not work ! Another reviewer has said that it seems to work , but only in harder soils . The reason it `` seems '' to work in hard soils is that moles do n't LIKE hard soil , so they move to where you are watering or elsewhere to soft soil . I recently noticed a HUGE mole hole just a couple feet from this Sweeney spike , where the soil is softer . Moles really do n't seem to mind these sonic devices , because as long as they find soft soil , they quickly adapt to the sonar output .	-1
Moles or gophers had wreaked havoc in my backyard lawn by digging up holes and leaving sizable mounds of dirt here and there . I triedHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent , 5-Pounds Granular Shakernear the damaged areas but the critters simply dug holes around other areas without the repellent ; ca n't preemptively place the Havahart deterrent because ca n't predict where critters will dig . This Sweeney 's Mole and Gopher Solar Sonic Spike deterrent seems like a viable alternative solution ! Likes : > I followed the instructions on the box by making a pilot hole first with an old metal rod so it was easy to insert into semi-moist soil. > Emits a low , intermittent beep when activated by sunlight ( even with the power switch off and only audible when close to the solar spike ) . > I made sure not to insert all the way down to the mini solar panel to facilitate easy removal. > Even placed a my own clear screen protector ( surplus ) to prevent scratches to the solar panel. > So far , after a week , no new holes dug up by critters ! Dislike : > Entire solar spike is not very visible once inserted down to grass level . The mini solar panel top may be damaged if not removed prior to mowing , children playing , or just walking across on the lawn.Overall : An install and forget garden tool that 's currently helping deter gophers/moles from digging up my backyard lawn . Long term effectiveness and durability is unknown . ***Updated June 24 , 2014 . Within the last two months we 've had another gopher outbreak in the backyard . This solar spike no longer works as a gopher deterrent , but became an attractant . The wily gophers dug holes right next to the solar spike . Could be used to attract gophers to bait or traps .	-1
Hang on there ... UPDATE ... May 27 , 2012They work , yes , but they only work for about three months.At this rate I need to replace 6 of them every 3 months at $ 20 - $ 25 each , that 's $ 120 - $ 150 and annually $ 480 - $ 600 . I 'm going to try propane gas next . Someone mentioned using lit flares shoved down into the holes but the chances of lighting my whole garden and home on fire is a bit worrisome.I 'm going to check other manufactures , too. -- -- -- -- -O -- -- -- -- -- Earlier ReviewI 've tried nearly everything from cyanide graduals to chocolate flavored ex-lax , yes , Ex-Lax . I was ready to put carbide graduals down into the tunnels in order to 'gas ' them to death . While at the hardware store one of the employees vouched for this Sweeney 's Solar Mole/Gopher Stake ( spike ) .I-T - W-O-R-K-S ! ! ! I paid $ 25 for ONE stake/spike . I just ordered two for $ 25 right here on Amazon ! NOTE : The moles/gophers eventually get used to the vibration/sound , so you have to relocate them about once a month . They work best in hard clay soil because that allows the vibration/sound to carry further.I wish I could meet Sweeney ... I 'd give her/him a big hug ! My garden is doing so nicely without the moles .	-1
I selected the Sip & Seed feeder from Vine because I do love to watch birds , and especially want to provide water . It 's so much fun to watch birds play in water on a hot day ! I used shelled safflower for the feed side . We moved last year , and at our old place we had no squirrels at all . But there are a few here , and after doing some research decided on safflower meats . Yes , it is more expensive , but I do n't have to clean up hulls . I 've had lots of wrens , and a cardinal ( maybe two , I 'm not sure ) , and some sparrows . No blue jays yet , but they do n't usually come to feeders in these parts till later in the year.I hung the feeder from a shepherd 's hook . It looks fabulous right now , but I do n't think the plastic reservoirs are going to hold up , and the way they 're made , they 're kind of difficult to clean . To be honest , I have n't had any takers for water yet , but we 've had rain every day for weeks . It only stopped raining yesterday . Come summer , bacteria and mold can build up in that plastic , and if you 've ever owned a plastic feeder , you know how difficult it is to remove oil from the seeds and mildew from wet , hot plastic . Eventually the wind and birds will scratch it too . Well , really , the most important thing is safe feeding and watering for the birds , right ? Glass would be pretty heavy , but much easier to clean.Yes , this is a nice-looking dual feeder/waterer . But you can get a much cheaper , uglier but functional feeder with a tray and perch for about ten dollars ; just get one made with easy-access openings for cleaning and enjoy birding ! 4/4/12 - I came back to update my review . This thing is absolutely horrible . The wind rocks both units , causing the water to spill out . When it gets close to empty , the wind blows that one clean off ! So I started using just the seed container , with the safflower . Well , the safflower gets jammed in the feeder . I was very excited at first , but the birds stopped coming because the seed was all stuck up in the jar . And the first time the seed gets wet ? Fuhgeddaboutit . You have to empty it and refill . I finally gave up on it .	-1
I received this bird feeder and at first it seemed like it was a great feeder . But as the days turned to weeks I got tired of it.The feeders are built out of plastic , a complaint some people have , however for me it 's a positive because squirrels and other critters keep jumping on the bird feeders and knocking all the seed out of them and also knocking them off the hook onto the ground . I 've tried putting these feeders in various locations around the yard and no matter where they go squirrels knock them over.Filling the feeders also proves to be a tad difficult . Once can be used for water and the other food , in my case I 'm using them both for food as I have a bird bath already in the yard.I use a number of other feeders in my yard and never have squirrel issues with them . Occasionally a squirrel will get on the feeder and eat the seed but never knocks them off the hooks . Other feeders I have also have a wire cage around them as part of the design to keep squirrels off . This is the only feeder in my yard that I ca n't keep filled or hanging.I think if the company that made these put some sort of a closed hook fastener to keep it secured that may solve one issue of them falling over . But because the hook is open on one end it easily pops right off . A poor design flaw if you ask me.I 'm pretty much done using these feeders , it 's far to much hassle and an inconvenient for me . I 've seen other feeders work far superior in my yard and this one just has to many faults to work in my environment.If you live in a part of the world where there are no squirrels and there is no wind that could knock these off the hooks then they may be for you .	-1
This has to be the most difficult bird feeder to manage . It is very time consuming to fill and the second one for water is useless as well .	-1
As others have pointed out , this item has several flaws - including labeling it `` copper '' , since it 's simply a copper-colored paint over plastic.The second flaw is a lack of drainage , and if you live in a rainy climate , you 'll want to be careful to drill some drainage holes , otherwise you 'll get some messy birdseed . I used a 1/16 '' drill bit and put three holes in the bottom of each tray - now it drains fine.The third flaw , which I have n't found a good solution for , is this . Depending on how you mount it , the feeder can be easily unbalanced , causing seed or water spills . I ca n't take credit for figuring this one out - the squirrels that live in my yard found out that by sitting near one edge of the feeder , it tips onto its side and most of the contents spill out.It 's an attractive product I suppose , but seems to require some TLC to get the best out of it .	-1
The Birdscapes 389 Copper Sip & Seed Feeder looks GREAT ! Too bad it 's not copper . It 's painted . You notice it right away . Perhaps it wo n't rust , but upclose it looks a little cheesey . From far it looks fine , but forget about getting a nice patina over time . I put it up right away , very excited to see how it works ... .well I found out . Apparently , this is made for dry/desert regions where rain is not an issue , becuase it really has no way to drain water away or out of the seed dispenser . It has been raining like crazy here , and all I have a very swollen seeds ... .with any luck they will germinate ( sarcasm ) . Two stars because it looks great , but that 's about it ... ..oh , I did n't get a lot of bird action before the rain came , but the squirrels were all over it ( nothing new ) ... .at least something got fed . So , if rain is a normal weather condition for you , I would pass . If you live in the desert or very low rain area , this probably would do well , and it really does look good ... .too bad it 's not really copper ... ..It did say Copper Sip & Seed Feeder . I wonder if I can use it just to feed/attract hummingbirds ? I will try it and let you know if I get any ... .if not , it seems like a waste .	-1
I purchased this Sip & Seed set sight unseen because of its style and versatility . The metal hanger is robust and appears to be painted a copper color , so I saw no rusting during the time I used it . The glass containers are heavy and thick . The cap on the top and bottom are copper colored metal as well , but be advised that the tray itself and the ports where the water/seed exits is just copper colored plastic . The tray can be rotated to open or close the ports . The top cap is removable and the bottom finial can be unscrewed to remove the bottom metal portion.I stopped using this set to present seed because of one serious design flaw : There is no feature for rainwater drainage . That may seem a little obvious ... if they both can HOLD water , then they are not designed to let water ( such as rainwater ) drain out . What that means , unfortunately , is that everytime it rains , the seed tray will fill with rainwater . That rainwater will also fill the inside of the glass to the same level . In one day , the seed becomes contaminated and clogs inside the glass and the seed ports . Mine would never dry out to allow seed to flow again.I attempted to drill drainage holes in one tray to allow drainage , but it 's just too far down through the plastic tray and the bottom metal cover for it to drain efficiently without quickly clogging.Unless you 're willing to clean out the seed every time it rains a little bit , I recommend you stick to presenting water only in this feeder or mount it under cover .	-1
My order arrived promptly and in un-damaged condition.After just 3 days of use , the Orbit # 62024 Watering Timer started leaking internally -- and it got progressively worse for the next 2 days . Attempts to repair it were useless , as the cheap plastic construction gave signs of more problems in the future.I wasted my money on this poorly-made piece of junk , but Amazon 's great Returns Policy made good for the bad unit . I 'm hoping for better luck with another Orbit model.UPDATE -- 20 December,2012 -- I tried a different model -- Orbit 91213 One-Dial Garden Hose Digital Water Timer -- it was very easy to set up , and has been working very well for several months , with no sign of leaks or malfunction.UPDATE # 2 -- 30 August,2013 -- Orbit Model # 91213 has performed flawlessly for over a year with no leaks , no failures , nor problems of any kind.That said , I would suggest buying the Orbit # 91213 -- and forget about the # 62024.Good Luck ! !	-1
Maybe I got a defective unit , but it leaked when being hooked up to my hose . Nice and tight , even replaced the interior washer but no luck .	-1
I purchased this item last April , but I did n't use it a lot . I only use my hose occasionally to clean up the yard after my dog . At the beginning , the hose nozzle worked fine . After a while , it started leaking in one place and then it leaked in more and more places as I continued using it , getting to the point where even my clothes got wet . I noticed that I am not the only buyer having the leaking problem with this nozzle . This item went in the garbage now and I ordered a different one also from Amazon.com .	-1
Cast iron , brightly colored so its easy to spot in the grass , smaller than most sprinklers , throws a very serious amount of water in a wide pattern . No moving parts , heavy enough to toss it around a little without breaking it ... it should last as long as its predecessor which was similar and lasted for > 10 years before I broke it.Edit : I 'm going to cut back on expected lifetime . There is no paint or coating on the interior of this sprinkler , and its already started to rust from the inside out , quite aggressively . In fact , if you 've used this and shut it off and then pick up the hose , you 'll get a quart of very rusty water out of the sprinkler , which does n't come out of the pants too easily.So what will happen is that this will rust considerably on the inside over the next couple of years ( including as I see the hose threading ) and either the hose attach piece will snap off or it 'll crack the next time I accidentally whack it on a rock.A little coating on the inside would have considerably extended the lifespan . Bummer , but its all about saving a few pennies in manufacturing these days.Update : I dropped this from 5 stars to 2 , and it probably deserves one star . As I mentioned in the original review , its made from cast iron , and no attempt was made to coat or seal the inside . Its already halfway rusted out after less than a years use.I do n't know about you , but I 'm pretty tired of buying things that are intended to come into contact with water and they rust in under a year . I have a similar head that lasted a very long time , but thats because the manufacturer galvanized it , inside and out . I have many other sprinklers that are almost 20 years old.So , fabulous sprinkler if you only plan on using it one summer and then tossing it .	-1
this monster weighs nearly 2 lbs . is 8 inches long by 3-1/2 inches diameter . it destroyed a perfectly good hose as the weight and unwieldiness of it opened up the hose itself at the nozzle connection . i am going to donate mine to the fire department , maybe they can use it .	-1
I have an old galvanize can ( antique ) that looks very similar to this one . I was hopeful ... ... ( sigh ) The can arrived and the first thing I noticed is how flimsy it is . The galvanized metal is so much thinner than the old-timey ones ... typical for all modern products , I suppose . The second thing I noticed is where it 's made . No , not China ... Mexico . Figures.The screw off nozzle did screw off , but then would n't screw back on . Why ? Because the thread is almost non-existent . But I 'm fairly handy and was able to jury-rig it back on . Water pours from the nozzle much better than any plastic model off the shelf , I will give it that.The wire carrying handle , with the cheap little plastic hand guard is just that ... .cheap , cheap and flimsy . After one season in the sun the plastic will get brittle and crack for sure ... .I 've already duct taped mine to make a more useful hand guard with a bit of cushioning.Why did n't I return it ? I should have ... .it most certainly is NOT worth the money , but I 'm stubborn and too lazy to shop for another watering can . ( How odd that I will gladly haul water back and forth on 2 acres all day , but the effort to shop for a better can just seems too daunting . )	-1
I placed a Safer moth trap in 2 separate enclosed closets . After 30 days , neither trap had lured a single moth.The traps themselves are paperboard with a sticky side . A small square of pheromones is in a separate packet . You have to open the packet and put the square on the sticky paperboard . Easy enough.The Safer product just did n't work for me . Easy product to assemble , but zero results .	-1
I understand that this product is to be used to alert you to moths in your home . It is obviously not a trap used to eliminate them or rid you of the pesky guys . We have an existing moth issue , so I knew ahead of time that it was already a problem . I figured testing theSafer Brand Clothes Moth Alert Trapwas going to be quick and easy and an excellent way to show that it works . So we placed the trap alerts in two closets that we currently see moths in and then watched and waited ; a couple days , a week , two weeks and a month . Unfortunately it did n't trap one moth in either closet during that entire time , yet we still see them fluttering around . Overall I ca n't recommend a product that was a complete failure .	-1
Since moving to the country , we 've had a problem with clothes moths . Mothballs in the cedar closet help , but we have other non-cedar closets and do n't want all our clothes to smell like mothballs . The little moths are very happy with our carpeting , upholstery , and our clothing no matter how often we vacuum or clean . I placed one of these traps in two different closets , both of which I knew to have more than just the occasional moth . In both cases , over the course of about three weeks , the trap caught a single moth . And in both cases , I spotted more than one moth on the wall and dispatched it more directly and vigorously.These traps are a single sheet of cardboard folded over to make a triangular opening at both ends . On the inside is adhesive , like fly paper , and onto that you place a small square of bait . Maybe there 's not enough bait , as the adhesive seems pretty strong , or maybe the moths I have do n't like this particular bait . In any event , I 'm still looking for a moth solution .	-1
In my opinion , the product description is misleading , however the box this product arrives in is very clear . It states , `` This product is designed to alert you to a potential problem and is designed to trap adult moths , NOT the larvae which do the actual damage . '' If you catch moths in your closet , you are advised to thoroughly clean all clothing.The product is basically two cardboard traps with sticky sides and bait you unwrap and insert . There was no picture showing how to insert , so I 'm not sure if I have installed it properly . They recommend hanging the product at eye level , but there is no attachment for hanging.Basically I found this product to be very cheaply made with a misleading description on Amazon and very poor instructions . So I am not pleased and ca n't recommend this product .	-1
Earlier this year , I put some Safer Pantry Moth Traps in my kitchen and essentially watched my moth problem disappear . The pheromone-based trap was a powerful magnet for moths and within a couple of weeks , I had dozens of dead moths stuck to the inside of the trap . So I was optimistic about Safer 's Clothing Moth Traps , since I began noticing tiny moths flying around my bedroom . Unfortunately , after two weeks of having the traps in the bedroom and closet , I have n't caught one moth , though I still see them flying around . I 'm assuming the pheromone is different since these moths are not the same as those who infest pantries . Whatever it is though , it is n't working . Not recommended .	-1
Save your money . I only tried because my originals are n't carried any more . I 'm trying Pro Pest next . These are AWFUL !	-1
We have a problem with pantry type moths which apparently come into the house with dried grains and such , but once they 've arrived they seem to multiply like crazy . We tried these moth traps which are safe and non-toxic . I like that feature . But the thing is that they catch very few moths . I purchased another brandCatchmaster Moth and Pantry Pest Trap : Three Packs of Twothat trapped more moths in a week than this brand did in two months . So I now purchase that brand instead .	-1
I bought these moth traps , because the moths were eating through suits , shirts , and even my cotton shower curtain . I had them out for at least two weeks and they did n't catch one moth . If I could give these traps a '' 0 '' I would because that is how many moths they caught . I started using Pro-Pest Pheronet `` Pheromone Trap '' and they caught moths right away and many of them , by day 's end .	-1
We definitely have a small infestation of moths in our home . This problem just started earlier this year , and never had a problem until now . But sadly , the only thing this lure trap collects is dust.The box contains two triangular folded traps with glue on two walls inside of them . The bottom is where you put the .5 '' paper which contains pheromones to attract the male moths.Knowing that we definitely have a problem and understanding that this is designed to lure the males to it , I just ca n't imagine that they would all be females.Sorry , I just can not recommend this Safer Clothes Moth Alert trap , at this time .	-1
After using this for half a season I finally got tired of a bad mow job and having to take the blower and go around the lawn and blow the clumps apart . I mow often , every 3 days , I even tried raising the deck to see if that would help . I bought an OEM Toro blade and swapped it out and just mowed the lawn . My lawn looks great again , no streaks , no clumps , I even lowered the deck a notch before I started mowing . It 's night and day , I thought from reviews this might do a better job at a lower cost , not for me . Maybe different grasses have different results , I live in Minnesota and have thick grass . I would not recommend this product and would never buy again .	-1
Some of my herbs were completed invaded by insects a few months ago . I tried using this and did n't seem to work too well . The herb that was infested was completely eaten to the stem , it was sad . I managed to save some of them though ! The ones that I saved I did n't put anything on . Seemed the bigger plants got worse with insects after I added the killing soap to it .	-1
Yeah , right , I should have known it was too good to be true for the price , and lo and behold , I was right . The advertisers say this unit uses steam to clean your grill . Well , under certain circumstances , that is right . If the grill is still boiling temperature hot , and you squirt or use the unit on the grill , it will vaporize the water , making steam , and allowing your steel bristles to do a good job . Now , let 's think about this , when it is that hot ? For me , only when I have finished cooking my meat , then I want to EAT ; I do n't want to take the time to use this unit . By the time I have finished , the grill has cooled , eliminating the advantage of this unit . It was my own fault ; read the fine print , and you will see that you must use this when the grill is really hot . There is no steam in the water you put into the unit ( there is no heating element in the unit ) . Anyway , live and learn .	-1
We have had these for a few months now and they do n't really seem to do anything . Back in the '90 's before the EPA stomped on the ingredients these worked great . Do n't waste your money on these .	-1
We bought two gallons of Wet and Forget at Costco . Applied per directions to some very moldy/ mildewey wood decking as well as a very mildewey painted wall and waited as directed . After 3 months of zero improvement , we applied again and scrubbed with a brush , ( but did not rinse ) . This loosened up about 50 % of the black mildew and with the next rains , it rinsed away . One year later , we can see some minor `` peeling '' effect of the remaining mildew layer on about 25 % of the deck , but most of the deck simply returned to it 's original back nastiness . I would say that the mildew has actually gotten worse over the last year , not better . We finally pressure washed it and then reapplied the wet and forget thinking that it might help prevent the return on the black mildew , but it has n't . In the deck areas that get hit by the sprinklers , the wood is black again after only 4 months . The moldy wall never improved beyond our scrubbing efforts despite reapplication of the Wet and Forget . I do n't know if the product just ca n't perform in extreme hot/humid conditions like South Florida or we got a bad batch , but I would not recommend this product . We went back to pressure washing after one year of trial with Wet and Forget . Pressure washing takes about the same amount of time to do as applying W & F and results are instant and beautiful .	-1
A lot of trouble for very little result ... . I followed instructions closely and I 've been using this for several weeks . In that time I 've only trapped a total of six wasps and zero yellow jackets . I finally threw it in the trash yesterday . Not worth the time to maintain it .	-1
This item simply did n't work . I got a few hundred little ants and that was it ; the yellow jackets were not interested . Apart from anything else , you ca n't put much juice in the container , otherwise it spills out through the entrance holes . The result is that , after a day in the hot sun , the juice has dried up , leaving a thin , solid residue on the bottom ; something which seemed to attract only the ants .	-1
I was very disappointed with this product . If you have a chain saw , then use it instead . This is designed okay , just not very practical for doing more than a few cuts .	-1
I 'm confused why the micro bubbler needs to be staked . I thought this was a microspray since it is staked , but the pattern reaches just a few inches from the emitter . I guess if you were watching the spray as the system was on and you wanted the LOOK of the pattern being level , the stake would be useful . Other than that , it seems unjustifiable expense . I 'm glad I only bought one pack.If you want a micro bubbler and do n't need it staked , then I recommend the Nsstar set B00DW5GN0G . A much better value ( without a stake . )	-1
I have installed my first drip irrigation system in the spring of 2009 using all components from DIG . This year I decided to expand and build a new branch which required a whole new set up : the second pressure regulator , hose to tube adapter , timer and of course more tubing . Unfortunately , I did not realize there were different types of tubing material which can be stiff rather than soft.DIG tubing was soft and pliable and stayed exactly where I put it . Rain Bird tubing is stiff and even though I kept in the sun for several hours after unrolling it did not become any easier to work with . It is much harder to control , harder to place where you want it , if you do n't put a stake where the tube naturally curls it rips itself out of the stakes . I needed to run it over the bulk head as the spigot was on the other side from where I needed water and instead of laying flat in the channel is ripples and is visible in sections.The tubing does delivery water , installing barbs ( after soaking in very hot water to make the tube softer ) worked fine . So it works as tubing just fine . However , it is harder to work with than DIG tubing and it is more visible because it does not get trained to a shape you want it to be even after several weeks in the hot sun.Next time I need new tubing I will not be using Rain Bird Dripline tubing .	-1
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development , metabolism , reproductive activity and many more ( E.g. , see Science Daily `` Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally '' , January 22 , 2013 , or Google for a very long list of other articles . The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and does n't seem to be disputed . ) I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not . They replied that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders . They also explicitly stated that they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder . Let 's encourage them to change that stance ! I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do . Even if one is n't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds , consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations . Furthermore , consider the food chain and the general fact that we 're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it . This feeder has many _great_ properties , but it 's not the only feeder with them ; personally I will buy alternatives ( of which there are plenty ) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs . I would love to see them do so .	-1
Bought one of these because I liked the cable . Tested it against two others and it always showed the plant as being more wet than it really was . Might have been a defect but that was my experience .	-1
The Rapitest , besides having a horrible product name , can not consistently measure soil moisture . You are better off using your finger or a dry Popsicle stick . In addition , the optimal meter readings that they provide for various plants is way off . I would kill my plants if I used them.It 's a shame because I really wanted to like this product because it is easy to use . However , ease of use does not matter when the product does not work at all .	-1
I guess I should have read all the reviews ... I got this the other day and opened it tonight to try on my plants . I tried my cactus 's first ... indicator showed dry ... thought ok , have n't watered them in awhile . Then I tried it on some plants I just watered yesterday ... dry again . Humm ... . can not be correct . Put the probe in a glass of water ... still dry . Obviously this is defective or cheap . It 's going back and I 'll look for another ... .	-1
Reading the hype on the packaging , the Rhino-Tuff looks impressive . First , the unit employs eight cutting strings instead of four or two . Second , the round rubber string holders are able to rotate 360 degrees with ease . This design minimizes shock and abrasion on the cutting strings - requiring less reloads and saving money..After using the Rhino-Tuff , I find the product ineffective . Here are my complaints : .1 . The retail price is twice the price of its competitor , the Grass Gator 5600..2 . The rotating string holder works great in avoiding string abrasion and breakage . When the cutting strings hit concrete , a fence , tree , or rock , they pivot away - shock and abrasion are minimized . After trimming my yard , there is very little wear on the strings . Compared to my Grass Gator 5600 Trimmer Head , I average two to three reloads..Unfortunately the Rhino-Tuff is terrible in its prime function - cutting grass . When the strings hit grass , all pivot away instead of cutting through . They bunch together and knock the grass down in a circle . The situation requires you to do a second , third , or fourth sweep with the weed whacker to complete the cut . As a result , it takes two to three times longer to do yard work . . . . The few cents savings on string are not enough to compensate for the extra time needed to trim grass..3 . The Rhino-Tuff is not 100 % compatible with all the grass trimmers in the market . The kit comes with three stainless steel nuts to attach the unit to the weed whacker . That is not enough to work with minor brands like Hitachi , Tanaka , or Stihl..I have a Hitachi CG 24EKS . I was able to attach the device by using one of the nuts from my Grass Gator 5600 kit and purchasing a steel washer with a 0.5 inch hole from Lowes..Given all the reasons listed above , the conclusion is obvious . Save your money and buy the Grass Gator 5600 .	-1
The way they are pictured , it seems simple to just place them individually and light them . In fact , they come in one 6-cube by 4-cube mass of cubes . Each cube is attached to at least three other cubes by the plastic cut that surrounds each cube . Also , each cube has a aluminum foil on top of it to seal the flammable material in the plastic cup.The first challenge is how to separate them . They do not just pull apart . I cut mine with a scissors , which resulted in small pieces of the flammable material all over my counter . Then I wondered , do I remove the foil ? Is the plastic cup flammable ? There are no answers to these questions on the packaging.That precedes the question of how to ignite the cubes once charcoal has been stacked on top of them . There are three answers to that question , a long fireplace match , a propane torch or charcoal lighter fluid . My choice was the latter and viola , instant flames , and assumed Weber lighter cube ignition.What seems simple when reading the sales literature is in fact , not simple at all . And if you are using a chimney starter to light your charcoal , the problem will be magnified , although you could probably put charcoal in the chimney , hold it over your head to be able to see the cubes and ignite them with a butane lighter . ( I would not recommend using this procedure if you would need to use lighter fluid to ignite the Weber cubes - unless there is a shower nearby with plenty of soap and water available . )	-1
We 've tried just about all the traps out there - and basically , after tracking performance for about a year , the top performer in our warehouse was an old fashionedVictor Mouse TraporVictor Rat Trap.However , we had a trap-shy rat get inside the house . I was afraid it might be pregnant looking to nest ( it *was* ) and wanted to catch it quick before any pups were born . I tried D-Con poison only to learn that it could take up to 10 days for it to work , and I could n't wait.I set several types of traps , including this one ( I paid $ 4.98 at Lowes ) since the bait cup is large & you can put anything in it . The rat initially came upstairs to seek out some large chunk dog food , and since it was trap-shy , I thought it would be best to bait it with something familiar ( the dog food is too big/heavy for a traditional trap ) .After 8 days of eluding us , this method worked within 4 hours ( I give as much credit to the bait as to the trap ) . But it did NOT kill - the neck was stuck between the teeth of the trap . In an old fashioned Victor trap , it snaps on the neck , not the head , which is instant & humane.This was in the kitchen , I was not home , and my wife was severely traumatized . It was flopping around everywhere , bleeding and contaminating *everything* in the kitchen , peeing and pooping everywhere . It 's rear claws scratched up the cabinet doors . My wife had to lock up our dog & cats , who were curious but were in harms way . Awful , awful , awful . This was hours of cleanup , and it was terribly inhumane.With a few tweaks , this could be a superb trap . But it did not do the job , and this was just awful folks . It does n't matter if it 's in your living space , or a basement , attic , warehouse , garage , etc ... do you really want to spread blood , potential disease/tick/lice/etc everywhere ? Ok , so here 's our apples-to-apples comparison . 9-month experiment , testing 7 different products . We eradicated all the rats ( 11 total ) , and the oldest , simplest , cheapest trap is the clear winner : *Victor Old Fashioned Rat Trap- 7 ( caught 7 of 11 ) * Tomcat Rat Snap - 1 ( caught 1 of 11 , but did NOT kill it ) * D-Con Baitbits - Killed 3 , but the bodies all ended up in a wall or floor , causing a HUGE stink and a HUGE mess to dig out . In one instance we had to remove part of a floor - took hours and cost hundreds of dollars . Given time , all the rodents may have eaten the bait , but the poison takes 3-10 days to take effect so it 's hard to say . Poison has other problems - it gets spread around , it can be eaten by pets , or , a pet or wild animal might eat the dead/poisoned rodent . If you 're going to use poison bait , we strongly recommend also using traps . *Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap- Zero ( O ) . Left out for continuously for 9 months ( 270 days ) *Tomcat Block Bait- Zero ( 0 ) * D-Con Rat Glue Traps - Zero ( 0 ) - This is an awful idea , just makes a mes . Avoid this ! *Tomcat Wood Rat Trap- Zero ( 0 ) , but the rat steals the bait every time . They do not snap . I whacked the trap with a broom handle and it still wo n't snap . Makes you wonder if the rat designed this one ! Final note : If you need help placing your traps or learning about best baits , go to the Victor web site . Good information , quick & concise . My two cents on bait : any nut butter ( peanut butter , etc ) works great , mix in a small piece of bacon for good measure . However , if your rat came into your home/garage/building because they found a food source ( like dog food , grain , etc ) , use that to bait your trap . Good luck !	-1
I have had a running battle with a nest of big red fire ants that 's been going on for about 10 yrs or so . I 've tried everything I can get my hands on to kill out this nest . I gave it a good treatment of this stuff and watered it in like it said . It did kill several but the nest is still working away like ants do . These are some smart ants that 's for sure ! I can stand a few feet away from the nest and they will ignore me . Till I reach out and shake some of this down on them ! Then they literally start charging right at me until I retreat at least 15 to 20 feet away from the nest . Then they start carrying this stuff away . They pick up all they can and will put it in a small area about 6 ' to 8 ' away . Those that carry it die and then others put the dead with the poison and then they stay well away from the area where they put it . I 've dug into the nest with a shovel turning all the dirt over down the length of the shovel 's blade and out to a circle about 8 ' across . Then sprinkled & sprayed every ant killer and bug killer I could find on it and turned that into the dirt too before finally soaking it pretty good with the hose . And tell you what , doing that without getting a bunch of them crawling up my legs was n't easy ! Thought that would have finally killed them out . Wrong ! Nest is still working away with what looks like several thousand ants gathering food and taking it to the nest . I fallowed a stream of ants one day . It was like a ant Freeway with at least 20 or more for each foot of travel . The line of ants went around the end of my trailer , up along the fence line between me and my neighbor and into a stand of tall grass that is at least 120 ' to 130 ' away from the nest . I 've never seen them travel so far or so many of them doing it.Any who , I 'm going to try this again later today after it cools down a little this evening . Sooner or later I 'll have to put a dent in the nest 's population . But so far , nothing has done much to it . I even tried plain gasoline and a couple pounds of salt that I use for melting the ice . Tried `` salting the earth '' which is supposed to kill anything that tries to live or grow on the area . It did n't work either .	-1
worst fire ant killer ever bought in entire life . I applied to over six large fire ant hills and it did absolutely nothing at all , even when applied tons of it and few days later , still nothing , if anything mounds got even larger . will not buy again . I called customer service phone number on bag and lady sounded like an idiot . She said she will note to her managers that the product does n't work on fire ants . thanks alot retard . will never buy again . total waste of money .	-1
I had gotten some new mulch spread around the house and flower beds . I wanted something to kill the ants if any came travelling in the mulch . This product was easy to spread , you just sprinkle and go . However , within a day we had ants everywhere . I do n't even know if the mulch had ants in it but after using this product I had ants coming and going . They were in the house , on the countertops , going back and forth across the deck . They were under the bathroom sink for goodness sake , in and out of the dogfood bowl , up and down the walls . I ca n't say enough but we had ants everywhere . So I guess if they product works depends upon your definition of effective ? Did it get rid of the ants from the mulch ? Yep ! But it did n't kill them they just went berserk . It has cost me a fortune for using this product because now I 've got borax and chemicals all over my pantry and countertops to actually kill the ants that are now all inside my house . I think it ran in ants that were quite content living in the ground OUTSIDE my house . Be forewarned .	-1
This did little to slow the ant population.I feel doubly bad because I try to use as few pest products as possible , but am experiencing a LOT of them this year , from crawlies like ants to fungus on my grapes and apples.Using this was a last resort , but even so it made little difference . Sprinkled and watered , as directed , but not very effective , at least on my strain of ants .	-1
I sprinkled this around some areas that we 've been having ant problems . The powder is white and stays visible for days or weeks , which is somewhat annoying if you use it somewhere that people can see . Looks almost like gym chalk spilled on the sidewalk . And the ants were back not long after , so all in all this product did not meet my expectation .	-1
Economy seed . Mostly filler . The picture is deceiving . I would not buy it again .	-1
Really not good , lots and lots of red seeds that they do not eat , nothing eats the silage type red seeds and it is full of it , way to many and not good for my birds anyway . Ducks eat it tho .	-1
When I received my Dramm heavy-duty `` brass '' hose nozzle , I was shocked to see a warning on the package . This nozzle contains LEAD ( as part of the brass ) , and you 're supposed to wash your hands after using the nozzle . This is absurd and unacceptable , what do these companies think they 're getting away with ? I ca n't advise anyone to buy this or any other brass hose nozzle , unless there is clearly no lead used in the manufacturing process .	-1
Leaked where the hose connects . The hard plastic washer which it ships with is junk . Buy some good rubber gaskets and it works fine . Great pressure but I miss the shower option on the trigger spray hose nozzle I had .	-1
Well in my way of thinking was if this stuff was strong enough to Poison Ivy , Poison Oak and tree trunks like it claims ? ? ? Well hell surely can kill most simple vegetation ? ? ? So I thought ... .. Surely I would get the best on both worlds ... . See I wanted to kill some simple weeds and grass in my flower bed along with some neighbors Ivy and Oak trying to grow onto my lawn . WRONG ! ! ! This chit sucks like hell ! It has n't even killed any grass ... ... . Ok so I thought ... . Maybe I should try it on some actual brush , tree stumps or Poison vines of any kind . It has now been 8 days and I do NOT see anything I sprayed with it dying or even turning colors . Before I sat down and wrote this review . I did go back and spray everything twice but mostly three times . What a freaking joke this chit is ! ! ! I bought two bottles . I will be returning the other . If any of you guys have ever read my reviews ... I tell it the way the product has worked for me and me only . I do not speak for a neighbor or a friend . So I am saying , & # 34 ; Stay away from this product ! ! ! Try any other product besides this one for any use for killing any type of vegetation growing period ! ! & # 34 ; Like I also said ... ... . & # 34 ; This chit sucks ! ! ! & # 34 ;	-1
We had a mouse roaming our basement and I decided to try this thing out . Always looking for a better mouse trap ! Well , I baited it with some high quality peanut butter and put it to work . It 's been more than two weeks and the thing has done nothing . Maybe the mouse is too smart for it , but I suspect it 's more a case of the better mouse trap just is n't . Some reviews say it worked for them , but for me it did absolutely nothing .	-1
Okay , so I was excited to get this . No more Decon or other poison in the house - good thing , right ? Wrong.Placed this in the bathroom ( mice seem to come in around the water heater pipes ) . First baited it with peanut butter . One week later , no dead mice , but lots of droppings . So tried small grains ( as recommended by the mfg ) , still droppings - no mice . Tried bits of cotton , oatmeal and finally even cheese . After a month of this , I was still cleaning up droppings around the trap , but still no dead mice.As an experiment , took the last pack of mouse poison and placed it against the wall . Re-baited the trap with fresh peanut butter and positioned the trap in front of the poison pack . Within 3 hours , the trap had been pushed out of the way and the poison was gone.Guess what I 'm using in the future ? No , I would not recommend this trap at all .	-1
The instructions are simple enough . Install four AA cells in the battery compartment , bait the trap and turn it on . I followed those instructions but all I accomplished was feeding the bait to a mouse or mice.The trap came packaged with four new AA cells . I installed them in the trap , baited the trap , turned on the power , observed a green `` ready '' light and placed the trap where I knew mice had been . The next morning the green light was off and the bait was gone , but there were no dead mice . When I installed fresh AA cells , put fresh bait in the trap and turned it on for another try , the green light glowed briefly , the trap made a quiet buzzing sound and then the light went off indicating that the trap was ready . The next morning a conventional spring trap next to this trap had caught a mouse but no mice were electrocuted and the bait was still in the electronic mouse trap.Instructions packaged with the trap say that four AA cells will electrocute 100 mice before they need to be replaced . I enjoy and appreciate the benefits of modern technology , but my Victor M250Pro Professional Electronic Mouse Trap appears to be ineffective , or at the very least , not as effective as old-fashioned spring traps.Although Victor seems to always be trying to make the `` better mousetrap '' , theirVictor Easy Set Mouse Trap 4 Pack M038remain most effective for me . If cost is an issue , this electric mousetrap is more than twenty times as expensive as their spring traps . If it had worked for me as advertised , it might be worth the extra expense for the convenience , but for me it has not worked at all . When or if it does , I 'll be thrilled to come back to this review and report it .	-1
I am still looking for the ultimate verminator . My neighborhood is adjacent to an open field , which is infested with thousands of field mice . Under normal circumstances , the mice stay in theirown environment . However , from time to time , we get overrun with the filthy critters . This winterwas especially bad.There are locations where the traditional Victor neck-breaker can not be used ; small kids and dogsmight blunder into them . I first evaluated the Victor M265 Kill & Seal Mouse Trap and found itwoefully inadequate . The mice could not get to the bait easily ; they seemed to be confounded bythe plastic `` house '' enclosure.This electrocution device appeared to be an economical solution . In actual use , though , the oldVictor snap-trap could not be beaten . The first week 's body count was 7 on neck breakers , oneelectrocuted . The next week saw 3 killed by traditional traps with none electrocuted . The invasionhas finally dissipated , and Victors ' traditional traps saved the day.This electronic trap is not at all intuitive . Baiting it can be confusing and could cause anelectrical short . Then , there is a single entry point for the vermin . I have sketched in threesuggested entry sites for Victor engineers to consider . Additionally , I bend fuzzy pipe cleanersand suspend them from the perforated end piece of the trap . The fuzzy wire enables me to slatherpeanut butter bait on the suspended wire.The mice have to see or smell the bait first , and they require easy access to the electrocutionplates . The old-fashioned trap had walk-right-in visibility and direct access to mouse heaven.The bait was never hidden by an unnecessary `` house '' of plastic.I think the only good mouse is a dead one . They are filthy vermin and not at all cute . Sorry , Mickey , but I am a Donald Duck fan . Someone should tell Victor to stop hiding the bait and useall that plastic to entice vermin into the electrocution zones.I am really disappointed in this unit . Yes , it works . The old-fashioned stuff works BETTER ! Another bit of heresy : I stumbled across an interesting bait : WD-40 ( ! ? ! ? ) I saw two mice eagerlysniffing about a can of the stuff in my patio . I decided to saturate a piece of cardboard with WD-40and inserted it into a Victor neck-breaker . The next morning resulted in a dead mouse . WD-40 works ! Few people realize that WD-40 is little more than perfumed FISH OIL.If you are stuck with using the electrocution method , spray WD-40 at the single entry port andsaturate a pipe cleaner ( with peanut butter or more WD-40 ) suspended from the perforated end of thetrap . If pipe cleaners are difficult to find , use a bent paper clip and secure a bit of cardboardto it . Otherwise , WD-40 would surely cause an electrical short if it reaches the floor electrocutionplates . Some people ca n't stand its odor , while others are n't fazed . Mice love it - is n't that thepoint ? The world will not be beating a path to Victor 's door ; they have not perfected the mouse trap ; Victorhas confounded mice with a trap that does n't look like a trap , has no easy access to bait , much lessadequate instructions to attract mice . There is no such thing as Einstein Mickey Mouse or Frank LloydWright Mickey Mouse , which this trap supposedly attracts . Be patient - a suicidal mouse will eventuallyblunder onto the electrocution surface and get its nuts fried .	-1
I tried peanut butter , and cat food . But neither attracted any mice.I keep checking and there new mice poops , but the light is still off and no critters are inside.the light does go on when I turn it on , so I know the batteries are good .	-1
I deployed the M250Pro along withVictor Easy Set Mouse Trap 4 Pack M038 . After several weeks , not a single mouse entered the M250Pro . All 4 of the Easy Set traps I placed , however , caught mice . I baited the electronic trap with peanut butter ; same as the Easy Set trap . I 'm giving it two stars , rather than 1 , because I have no reason to doubt the device will shock any mouse silly enough to enter it . I 'm sticking with the Easy Sets .	-1
It reads on the back , `` Not for children under 6 or to be used around pets '' . `` Wash off skin while inside '' .So , this is pretty much useless if you have an indoor mosquito and tick problem like I do . I travel and work on a freight boat where mosquito and tick are common amongst the dirty , smelly crew . I sleep in a hammock.The active ingredients cause skin burn , nose rash and general discharge of the eye Mucous membrane . So if you need it to sit on a sofa or bed , you 'll get the active ingredients all over the place .	-1

no one goes near this . Birds or squirrels.tried 2 different kinds of bird food . They are eating from other feeders.I do n't know why they wo n't eat from this one.If anyone knows please tell me ? it looks nice , and is well made .	-1
Nozzle works well but does n't have some of the spray patterns I like to use . Will by buying Dramm in the future .	-1
My search for a replacement hose nozzle found this.The pros : + Low cost , $ 6.24 + free shipping when I bought mine.+ Good product reviews.+ 8-way spray head.+ Sturdy metal base.+ Soft cushioned grip.+ Small size for easy gripping.The cons : - VERY difficult to reduce ... control the water flow . It 's pretty much full on , or off ! : (	-1
IF there were 'negative stars ' , this would earn some ! Just one more of a product which obviously is foreign made with no & # 34 ; quality control & # 34 ; . This is just the latest in a series of purchases which only 'work ' a couple months , before they crap out and become worthless	-1
Ok product . Not the best item at a great price . It is already leaking within a few uses . Try something else .	-1
The mice and I have been having a tough ground war ever since the neighbors decided to re-do their mini-barn and several families of mice turned our house into their own personal refugee camp.Anyway , we 've used traditional traps , regular glue traps and these covered glue traps . We 've killed lots and lots of mice but it took a LOOOOOOONG time for this covered trap to actually catch anything . It looks like it would work great ( mice like tunnels ) but it did not .	-1
I apologize in advance for being negative on this product . As well for inserting my own value judgement into discussion of the efficacy of this consumer product , but it 's germaine in this case , I think.Typical of Ortho products , this Home Defense Max Covered Glue Trap is high quality and works as designed . My problem is with what this is designed to do . . . .Continuing , I am ok with exterminating ( killing ) pests . Including mammals . It 's part of life and the food chain , with presumably humans at the top . And I am not a vegetarian or environmental activist . But in my estimation , where possible the extermination must be humane and instantaneous - I apply this to all mammals , reptiles , and birds ( I 'm on the fence on fish ) . The concept is the same whether for a mouse or a coyote.These traps function by gluing the mouse to the floor of the paperboard container where , terrified , it struggles to exhaustion and eventually starves/thirsts to death ( either in place or after a person has deposited it in the trash using the handy carrying tab ) . Unacceptable.These traps are useful , however , for trapping crawling insects . I place one near the corner of my sliding patio door to capture insect that manage to sneak in through small openings . In the event of a mouse problem , I will resort to the old instant-kill spring-loaded trap .	-1
I put this out this spring when the wasps began visiting our garden . They flew around and totally ignored it ! Not recommended .	-1
I have mainly used Rescue traps with the fishy smell and they work very well . This is worthless and OK for a few really dumb flies as everything rots inside . Attracts no hornets and very few yellow jackets . Waste of money and I have seen flies and YJ 's walk in and walk out .	-1
Like others , followed the instructions to the letter . Yellow jackets completely ignored the trap , no interest in even investigating the neighborhood . 10 days , not a single bee or bug of any kind . Going to try the shop vac next .	-1
I wish I hand read the reviews here before I sunk my hard earned cash into this product . To be quite frank it is absolutely worthless . I actually have absolutely nothing against wasps , hornets and yellow jackets but they freak my nieces and newphews out when they visit.After placeing these around the outside of the house the stinging insects seemed to completely ignore them and went upon doing what every these critters do ... eating and mating I suppose.Anyway , I will not be buying these again .	-1
I was actually excited to try this.I have a house on my property that has not been lived in for over 5 years , sothere are mice in there.I have tried regular mice traps with better success then this one.Put two of these traps in the house . One on the kitchen counter , one on the floor.I used Skippy peanut butter , as themice like that better then the kind I grind at the market.But after a week of leaving this mouse trap in the house for almost two week , Not one mouse bothered with this trap ! I can see mouse pooped , but NO Mouse in the trap , or tried to get in ! ! ! Needless to say , I 'm disapointed , and now going to try those plug in things , and use the old type of wood mouse traps.Sorry I could not give a more positive review.I'am going to give this another try , and if it works , I will be back to update this review .	-1
Beneficial only in that they can be used safely in a room with your pets . They are safe but hardly ever actually trapped a mouse	-1
We live in the Mid-Atlantic and I guess we 're bird-people because even our squirrels are glossy and fat , and we 've got birds that come back year after year , bringing their babies.I usually buy just straight Thistle seed for the Siskins and Gold Finches . This year I 'm trying two sock feeders along with our usual 4-perch 'house ' feeder because there has been such a traffic jam . And as an experiment , I bought the Scott 's `` Wild Finch & Small Songbird Blend '' . It was a whim , but I was interested in the 2X claim , as well as whether our birds would like the red millet.Well , the short of it is that they do n't particularly care for it . Certainly we have n't seen any increase in Finch traffic , in fact it 's died off a bit ... but I 'm not going to lay the blame for that at Scott 's feet . With birds you just never know . But in the socks all of the thistle is gone and what remains is red.THE SKINNY : : : I was concerned that the red millet might not fit through the slim feeder-slots on our house-style thistle feeder , but apparently it does.The Pine Siskins seem to like the millet better than the Gold Finches.As for the Red Millet , I did a bit of research and found out that it is frequently used as 'filler ' and does n't have a magic effect as one might conclude from the claims on the package.I 'm not planning on buying more except for the sock-feeders . It is just so convenient to have the spout on the Scott bag that I think it 's worth the price.Note : if you have n't been feeding birds for a long time , you might not know that local populations can have their own preferences . So it makes sense to experiment and try a bag of this-or-that to see what your local birds prefer.Pam T~mom/blogger/birder	-1
In terms of the price , this might be the best deal on Tomcat 's mice traps if the product works . However , the jury 's still out after about two weeks of use if the product still works -- I have yet to see any mouse activity on these traps .	-1
I used this with Motomco Gel Attractant , which I received at the same time . I 'm not sure whether to blame the traps or the Motomco Gel Attractant . There are mouse droppings in the areas where I placed the trap and I 'm certain we have mice , but after almost two weeks I have yet to catch a mouse .	-1
I & # 8217 ; m not having any kind of luck with these whereas the & # 8220 ; regular & # 8221 ; Tomcat traps are actually doing the trick . That & # 8217 ; s not to say they won & # 8217 ; t work for some people because I have a friend who is rather squeamish and uses this type all the time.She is using them on counters for the little city mice , but we have field mice that simply seem to bypass these . Perhaps it & # 8217 ; s because the baited traps are open , but I & # 8217 ; m not sure . They are easy to set up and are no hassle , but perhaps not worth the expense.There & # 8217 ; s a small & # 8220 ; door , & # 8221 ; if that & # 8217 ; s what you call it , on the bottom of the trap that can be removed and baited . The directions on the back of the box , which include visuals , are quite clear and easy to follow.I & # 8217 ; ve never had any luck with this type of trap before and it looks like they aren & # 8217 ; t going to work for me again . For what you get , these are way too expensive and I & # 8217 ; m not enamored with throwing out such a large piece of plastic for one mouse . Not for me , but maybe for the ultra-squeamish who can & # 8217 ; t approach it any other way .	-1
Mice are a fact of life on a farm . I hate them and spend a great deal of time trying to kill them.The Tomcat spin trap did not help me towards that goal at all . I can set them somewhere with lots of mouse signs and not catch any thing . They just run right by . I am catching lots of mice on glue traps and bait stations but I have not gotten one mouse with a spin trap . In addition to not being appealing to mice , these things trip very easily .	-1
The Tomcat spin trap design is meant to be a quick clean way to kill and dispose of mice . You set the trap with bait and wait for a mouse to crawl in the somewhat small opening and get killed when it goes for the bait . These traps will only work with small mice , and the kill mechanism is unreliable as some users have noted - sometimes mice will escape without triggering the trap and sometimes when it does strike them they do n't die right away . The one main plus with these for squeamish folks is that when a mouse is caught you just throw the trap away with the mouse inside . Of course that means that you can only catch one mouse per trap and then you would need to buy new traps for the future , similar to the glue traps that are commonly sold . These are safer than other traps if you have kids around , but if you really want a reliable way of catching mice these are likely to disappoint . I have found in my experience with multiple types of rat/mouse traps that I like the electric traps the best for indoor use , and if you have a recurring issue those will end up being more economical in the long run since a single trap could be used for many years .	-1
We have a pet squirrel that we hand feed peanuts to and leave a few extra out there on the deck for him to eat . Of course you can attract other critters . A mouse likes to sneak up on the back porch and get the peanuts . We set this trap out there thinking we would catch the mouse and not hurt the squirrel . So far the mouse walks right by it as if it is invisible . The squirrel thinks it is a peanut butter filled toy and plays with it every day.I am going to keep trying but so far I am not impressed . It cost a lot more than the old fashion traps and so far it has no results . I guess at least I have not trapped the pet squirrel in an old fashion snap trap . Maybe the mouse is smarter than the squirrel ! And me !	-1
We set these along with several others . After 2 weeks they are still mouseless ( but there is fresh mouse pooh on top of one ) .Pros : Very easy to setwould n't have to touch anything icky to throw awayCons : Holy cow these are big hunks of plastic for one use -- very , very wasteful and I would n't buy others even if they did work , just because of the way it makes me feel to throw away so much plastic.this just does n't work -- and we 've set two and there has been obvious mouse activity.I 'd give these a miss and just buy some of the Tomcat wooden traps ( which are easier to set and more effective than the standard victors ) . The wooden Tomcats caught mice even after a mouse has licked the peanut butter off the trap .	-1
First let me make it VERY clear that Amazon.com is ALWAYS the best . Top notch shipping , friendly/professional customer service , timely delivery . I absolutely love Amazon.com - NEVER have had a single problem.Weber makes incredible products , I personally own three Weber Grills and every family member and most of my friends have since purchased at least one because they admire mine so much . Now comes in to play Weber Customer Service ... ..I purchased this smoker Thursday 9/3/09 and had it shipped over night , which of course Amazon.com did perfectly . Since I knew the smoker was at the house so I stopped at my favorite butcher on the way home from my office , purchasing roughly $ 200 in meat . It was to be a great Labor Day Celebration with fine cuts of smoked meat at our annual End of Summer Bash . I came home and excitedly started putting together the smoker . However , the charcoal grate simply would not fit , something was amiss ... . I called Weber customer service and was notified that I was the 3rd person to call that day with the exact same problem . In the factory , someone was putting the charcoal grates for the larger Weber smoker in this package which need the smaller . The customer service representative was incredibly kind and apologetic . They said they would over night the charcoal great and refund what I had purchased in meat . I was saddened that my guests would not enjoy what I had so anxiously hoped to serve , but understood that mistakes do indeed happen , and that Weber was doing all it could to make things right . The party must go on.After the long holiday weekend , Tuesday comes and I expect to come home to a nice fedex package on my front porch containing said charcoal grill . As I pulled in the drive and to my dismay , no fedex package existed . Thus , I call Weber customer service . The first rep. said there was nothing in my `` file '' and that they would never agree to reimburse for the meat - unbelievably rude . I asked for a supervisor , and was of course , somehow was disconnected . I called back , and after three attempts finally a supervisor came to the phone . They said they would be sure to over night the correct grate to me , and they would have to check on the meat reimbursement . At this point , I did n't care as long as what I already had purchased would finally be complete.Wednesday comes , no grate ... .I give it another day ... ..Thursday , no grate . Four more calls to Weber , two different rude , unprofessional supervisors and assurance the grate would come over night . Friday ... .no grate . Yet another call to Weber , more rude customer service reps and supervisors then a notification that the grate would n't ship until October 8th , this would not do at all . Finally get the VP of Customer Service for Weber , a fellow named Mark . I understand how he came to his position , you clearly need to be the best at being rude and unprofessional to hold such a prestigious position at Weber . He of course assured me that they would ship a grate over night and I will receive the grate Tuesday.I for one feel that it was completely ridiculous what I had to go through just to get the product I had already purchased . This was by far the WORST customer service I 've ever received from any company . I will no longer purchase another Weber product regardless of the quality . I would rather buy a new grill every year for the rest of my life rather than cook on another Weber.Weber , you have lost a life long customer and several thousands of dollars because of something so ridiculous . I will never recommend a Weber product again , nor will anyone I know purchase another Weber product . I will personally purchase from another company and give it to them just to avoid another dollar going into a company that condones such poor customer service ... ... Good Bye Weber !	-1
Looking at the photos , I expected a fairly compact product made of shiny metal . One thing I hate about hose reels is that they & # 8217 ; re usually an eyesore , but this one looked nice . When it arrived , my first thought was that it was HUGE . Second was that it wasn & # 8217 ; t shiny at all . It looked like someone had taken a piece of scraped up pipe and shaped it into a hook . Also , it came with nothing to actually hang it ; no screws , brackets , nothing . It & # 8217 ; s a shaped piece of pipe with some holes drilled in it .	-1
The handle invariably cracks and breaks before you are able to use all of the product . This result in the sprayer either failing to spray at all , or it leaks the insecticide all over your hands . I 've used 6 of these in the past and only one handle did n't break.It seems Bayer is jumping on the band wagon of offering to sanitize our homes . I see no benefit in this product 'killing 99.9 % of germs that insects leave behind ' . Firstly I have never caught flu from a spider ; secondly the product is toxic , it is not like I can prepare food where I had previously sprayed . Obviously a marketing blurb dreamt up by some halfwit in an effort to differentiate the product from others.The product is OK , suitable for urban areas with low instances of pests . Out here in the boonies we found we had to resort to a professional product ( Cy-Kick CS ) , which incidentally is not only better at controller pests , but yields more product once diluted .	-1
On the basis of good experience with 4 other of the same hoses ( 2 - 50ft ordered last year ; 2- 25ft ordered this year , I ordered another 50ft . I like the fact that they 're relatively unobtrusive compared to the conventional thick round ones , and they take up much less space when removed and packed up for winter storage . Unfortunately the quality of this one was very poor . It leaks severely at the hose connection itself as well as having additional pinhole leaks near that connection . This was the last element of a complex timer based watering system , and I discovered the problem 3 days before leaving for two months . Perhaps I 'd just been lucky with my other hoses or maybe the 25ft hoses I got this year are from last year 's stock , and the quality of those manufactured most recently has gone down . Home Depot website has what I now think may be same hose with different packaging and reviewers there complain of leaking . Too late to re-order , so I 'll try waterproof tape . My other 75ft setup without leaks works fine all the way to the end of the run . Hopefully the tape will work well enough to give me enough water pressure so that this will also make it to the end . All in all , a major drag and irritation ... . ( Edit ) Just went to rearrange one of my 25ft sections and discovered another pinhole puncture . This is n't in a particularly problematic spot , but it does lend support to the idea that there 's a difference in quality between last year 's and this year 's models . I will not get these again .	-1
This style garden weeper is a great idea.The only problem is that it had a huge leak on day one.Rather than spending money to return it , we tried tying it off since the leak was about 3 feel from the end.Please , manufacturer , do better quality control in making and checking this product !	-1
I thought that this soaker hose would be a great way to keep my garden watered efficiently . Actually , I do n't find this to be very effective for my needs in south FLorida at all . Do n't use it at all .	-1
My original review was a five star . I am dropping it to two and I will explain below.The older Gilmour soaker hoses are excellent if you have one that was made before 2012 HANG ON TO IT AND DO N'T LET IT GO.THE HOSES THEY SELL NOW ARE NOT THE QUALITY ONES THEY SOLD ONLY A YEAR OR TWO AGO.I own several of the older hoses . I needed two more . I ordered them and the new is not the same quality as the old . The old ones have two seams and are heavy duty . On the older ones if you had a kink in the line all you had to do was turn the water on and the hose would straighten itself out . Not so with the new ones . Once they are kinked they stay kinked . This is an issue with me because I run mine through cattle panels that I tie my tomato plants to . It 's harder for me to get the kinks out in a system like this . It was not an issue with the older hoses.The newer hoses do not water as evenly as the old . Oh they are still a good hose but not nearly as good as they were just a few years ago.I am not sure but I think the price of the new hose is higher than the old . So basically they have reduced their costs by making a lower quality hose and increased their profits even more by charging a higher price . I still need more hoses but they will not be the Gilmour brand . Their short term business practices have lost them a long term customer because I now have to assume that they have probably lowered the quality on all their products.I dislike doing reviews like these . I really like my old Gilmour hoses and originally wrote a glowing review on them . I think that is what irritated me the the most . People may have bought the newer hoses based on my review . I 'm glad Amazon lets us edit these reviews even after they are a couple of years old.If Gilmour changes back to selling the old high quality hose I will edit this review again .	-1
I installed over 350 ft of this hose . Worked so well I bought more and more . Within two months , three have failed : a 25 ' , 50 ' and a 75 ' . Gilmor agreed to replace these but why would I ? Lifetime guarantee , yes . Gilmor also said this hose is for low pressure : 10 to 15 lbs . Pressure reducers in my stores are 25 lb . Wish I had saved my receipts so I could get refunds .	-1
I 've tried every type of mouse trap out there , including this one . Here 's my comparative assessment : - Old fashioned spring traps are still the cheapest , easiest , and most effective solution . Unfortunately , they 're also gross , especially if you elect to empty and reset the traps rather than just throwing them away once they 've caught a mouse.- Electric traps seem like a clever idea , but I have never actually caught a mouse in one . I 've had this Victor M260 set up in the basement for over a year , and it 's never caught a single mouse , despite the fact that other types of traps in the vicinity have caught multiple mice . I 've had another Victor electronic trap ( the `` single kill '' variety ) set up in the attic for several years , and it has n't caught a single mouse either , even though other traps in the attic have caught dozens over that same time . I have no explanation for why the electronic traps have had a zero catch rate while the traps around them have been busy catching mice -- I 'm just reporting my personal experience . Also , the electronic trap requires batteries and is very large/tall.- In my experience , the hands down champion is the mechanical Victor `` Tin Cat '' model . It 's a `` live catch '' trap with one-way trap doors . The mice seem to find it irresistible . Any time I see signs of mice , I put the Tin Cat in place and it never fails to catch the culprits . I 've placed the Tin Cat and electronic traps side by side , and the Tin Cat is always the one with rodents in it in the morning . The only downside of the Tin Cat is that you have to check it every day if you want it to be a live-catch system -- if you only check it once a week , you 'll find a bunch of dead mice in it.So , despite the M260 being a very clever bit of engineering , it is routinely outperformed by it 's mechanical cousin , which does n't need batteries . Also , the Tin Cat is much lower profile and is less conspicuous than the M260 , which is quite large , tall , and very conspicuous .	-1
I have a empty house on our property in the mountians , which mice seem to love ! I put some skippy peanut butter in this , and the mice could care Less ! This is easy to work . You put the peanut butter in the far end of the little box.Close it , push the button . It gives one green light to show its working . If it catches a mouse the green light flashes.The mice are suppose to smell the peaunt butter , and come running for it , when they start to walk accross the electric plates going for the peanut butter , it should kill them in 3 seconds , it says ! But that did n't happen , as I have not caught anything ! This box has been sitting in the old house for a few weeks , and no mice action at all ! ! Although This idea is great , it has not got any mice to come into the box for us ! If it should nab a mouse it drops it into a drawer , that you pull out and throw the mousein the trash.The way the drawer works , you would not be touching the dead mouse.The drawer should hold a few mice at time . ( I wish ) If I put mice pellets out , it will eat them and die . I now have another type of black boxthat closes so my pets can not get it . With the mice pellets in there , the mice come to that , eat it and die.Maybe someone here has a better idea of food to put in this to attract the mice..I surewould be interested ! If I do catch any mice in this , I will be back to report it .	-1
Do n't waste your money - this trap is completely useless . A traditonal trap ( wooden spring action ) was placed about a foot away from the Victor trap and continues to catch a few mice every week . The Victor Electronic Mouse Trap , on the other hand , has n't caught ANY mice despite being properly bated and switched on . This trap has even been moved to different locations in the house with the same result - absolutely no mice caught . I 've never seen such a useless product and would never recommend this product .	-1
I have a mouse problem , and this trap did n't help . Although I followed the instructions , tried several baiting techniques , and I caught only one mouse in several weeks . I was n't checking that often , and the mouse began to mummify and rot , and smelled nasty . I could n't clean it all out.Meanwhile , I bought a dozen traditional ( spring ) wooden traps , and they are blasting through the mouse population.There may be situations where this electronic trap will be useful ; but not with my mice.Also , it 's quite small . Smaller than it seems from the packaging .	-1
The Victor M260 Multi-Kill electronic mouse trap sounded like a good idea and many other reviews indicated it would eliminate mice infestations quickly , easily , and fairly humanely . I set this unit up in an area that has a known mouse infestation and checked daily for one week , with no results . The bait is intact and all systems are go , but the mice apparently are n't interested in entering the chamber to begin with . Not sure where the glitch lies as everything appears to be in order . Something is n't working , apparently . It 's hard to recommend a $ 90 mouse killing device that has n't killed a mouse in a weeks time , so I ca n't recommend it . My advice ? Go to the Humane Society and get a cat .	-1
Why do people keep trying to build better mousetraps ? For all of the reasons so many other reviewers have already stated ... tiny entrance hole wo n't catch larger mice , if batteries are not absolutely fresh you just end up with a confused looking mouse in the electrocution chamber ( it actually never did kill one ) , and the babble about it being `` humane '' ( you 're killing mice , frying them with electricity is humane ? ) There is really nothing more to add ... this product is just plain silly.Better mousetrap = a cat	-1
I got this device a few weeks ago and duly put the peanut butter at the end of the electric shock chamber and set it in the attic beside a hole in the asbestos ( where the mice burrow ) . So far , not one mouse has entered the trap . I 'd know , because once they get into it there is no way out , and yes , I turned it on.I love the design of the trap -- the stairs up both sides , the double doors closing the vermin into the top room , the instant shock , the dropping of the body into the box beneath -- but it 's all for naught if the mice do n't seem to want to climb into the darn thing to begin with.I 'm going to try again , this time putting the trap along the wall , even though there is n't as much evidence of activity there . Fingers crossed . . .	-1
I have been patient - I set the Victor M260 in a crawlspace where there are many signs of active mice and checked it every few days for several months . Not a single mouse was caught , but I had to change the batteries twice . The peanut butter bait was untouched . I followed the directions to place it along a wall and used gloves so there would not be a scent transfer , but no mice in the box.Seems like a good idea - if it worked .	-1
The Victor is easy to set up and easy to operate . However , no matter where I placed it , no mouse would try the peanut butter inside.I 'd try to keep it away from pets and kids , but as long as the top lid stays closed , it does seem to be safe for them . It is not for outdoor use , but after the earlier attempts , I decided I had nothing to lose and gave it a try . It continued to be operable after a few nights outside , though still did n't attract any mice.If someone has a lot of mice and a lot of money , give it a shot . Overall , I would not recommend spending the money and hoping it works .	-1
One of my pots ( the largest one ) arrived with cracked , chipped off paint around the top of the rim and I can clearly see the shiny silver metal bucket beneath the paint . Disappointing . I have my doubts as to whether this finish would have ever lasted outdoors , even if the paint had n't already cracked off . I am very hesitant to put this anywhere that the paint might discolor my wood deck . I am using the large , cracked one as a garbage pail in the garage.Not to mention these pots do n't come with drainage holes . I guess I will have to use the small one as a cache pot since I do n't want my plant to get root rot from improper drainage.In my mind , these fail on all fronts as `` planters ''	-1
Literally the first time I used these shears on a small jasmine vine , one of the rivets that holds the blades together , popped out , never to be found again in the mess that is my mix of tall grass and mulch . I tried to repair them , but noting I did n't have the right sized nuts and bolts , decided this was not one of those instances where I will just shrug off an inferior product , that I end up fixing myself ( especially after the FIRST use ! ) .So I sent a pic into Fiskars ( online return/warranty system is very nice and easy FWIW ) , showing the problem . I received no feedback for weeks ( by this time , my jasmine vine was out of control of course ) , then one day received a box with a set of their lowest quality shears inside . Not extendable , and they look like the cheapest shears I have ever seen . I doubt they will last a season , with the obviously cheap plastic they used for the handles.Talk about a slap in the face . My time is worth more than dealing with that kind of stuff , and I wish they would just lower their prices and forego the `` lifetime warranty ! '' deal if that is how they roll . I would never have purchased the shears they sent me , so basically I should have just bought another set ( NOT Fiskars obviously ) of shears when the originals broke . Ah well , you live you learn . Buyer beware on these , I see at least three other instances of this same problem happening in these reviews.UPDATE : To be fair , and as a credit to the company 's customer service , I actually did contact them later to let them know that I was n't happy about the switcheroo . They promptly sent a replacement for the exact shears I originally bought . Kudos for that ! Hopefully this pair will not fall apart when I start to use them .	-1
Bought one of these at HD and loved the way it worked so I bought my daughter one too ! The weak designed lever which is made VERY weak broke off on hers the 1st year she had it..mine lasted out the year and then broke off the start of the second season ... .I put a small pair of vice grips on shaft to use as the lever and got more use out of it until it just blew out the shaft completely and the water just shot out of the side ... A VERY EXPENSIVE PIECE OF JUNK ! stick with the old hand wind hose reels and save yourself a bundle..	-1
This is an ill-conceived , ill-designed , landfill item designed by a rookie engineer . The lever that is most used ( to change the unit from retract to freewheel position ) is designed with a definite shear point in the design . No joke . This thing is designed to fail . It is cast with a tee in the plastic lever that is .097 '' thick - that 's a little over 3/32 '' thick - made of plastic ! Mine snapped off on the first cool day - see the picture on the product page . Do n't buy this junk.Update 6/1/13 : Just took mine to the landfill . Although I had reinforced the rewind lever with epoxy and 1/8 '' aluminum plate - the inner drive gear snapped off . I bought a metal , hand-crank model to replace it . I see that Suncast has a newer ( probably redesigned ) rewind lever ( black ) listed here : http : //www.suncast.com/replacement/replacementdisplay.aspx ? repid=173 & prodId ; =504Hope that helps anyone trying to extend the life of their unit . But I reiterate , this product is designed for a short lifespan . I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a legitimately designed product .	-1
What a great concept with a crummy execution . The first time I used this , I thought it was the cats meow . It reeled up the hose nicely . After about 10 uses , the hose guide started to get out of sync with where the hose should be . It made loud clicking noises but still reeled up the hose just fine . However , when you try to pull the hose out it gets totally stuck unless you stand at the base of the hose reel and pull the hose in the direction it needs to go ( hose guide would be on the left side but the hose would be in the middle or on the right side creating a pinch that would n't allow the hose to come out ) . This makes pulling the hose out a nightmare ... inch by inch is not the way to pull out 125 feet of hose . Soon enough , two of our hose reels failed completely and stopped reeling in the hose ( lots of loud clicks but little reeling ) . The last one became so difficult to pull the hose out that we threw it in the trash ( last one ) . Given that I have experience with not just one , but three of these - I suggest you take heed : DO N'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS JUNK .	-1
Total bummer because the timer and valve seem to work nicely . However , it has already cracked and it leaks onto my porch . I wish we could get out of the & # 34 ; plastic & # 34 ; product obsession and go back to making things with quality materials .	-1
I was excited to recieve this from the Amazon Vine Program . Living in Alabama we have mosquitoes . We have had nothing but trouble with it from the beginning . It may be a great product , but we ca n't keep it running long enough to find out . We have followed the directions closely & followed all the trouble-shooting tips , but alas it just wo n't keep running . We have all necessary items needed for it to run correctly . At this point I am not sure what to do ... I guess just keep working with it . I would love for it to work & trap all the pesky mosquitoes that keep un indoors . I will update later if we can get it to stay running.UPDATE : Talked with the Mosquito Magnet customer service . They gave some help ideas that we tried . It worked great for a few hours . During the time it worked it did catch many mosquitoes plus gnats . We were thrilled ... but unfortunately it stopped working again & now stops working once it warms up . Customer service was called again . They were little to no help & did n't seem to concerned about their product . After many hours working with this product , we have given up .	-1
The large , surprisingly lightweight box arrived in perfect condition , no visible damage inside or out.When I removed the head unit from the box however , I heard obvious broken parts inside and immediately called their customer support.After all , inside the box was a large STOP ; call our dedicated , superior customer support for any trouble . I assumed this would be quickly taken care of since the self report their customer service to be so good.While they answered the phone quickly the quality of support was poor.I had an obviously defective unit with broken pieces inside and they would n't help unless I tried to turn it on first . This seemed like a bad idea for a product that hooks up to a fuel source . They wanted me to believe that the sound ( broken pieces rattling and rolling around inside the head unit ) I heard was normal.I could forgive this , after all they do n't want to pay return shipping for an item that was misdiagnosed by a end user that does n't have product experience . So I removed a cover piece and poured out the broken pieces , sent a photo to them in email , and was again refused support . They suggested try turning the unit on and see if it worked , and then sent me to follow up with Amazon for the defective unit.The plastic pieces appear to be part of an internal frame , cage , or some other support . It is a strong , but brittle , black plastic . In addition to 4 large pieces , many small shattered fragments came out of the box . While the piece that was broken may not be critical , the question remains why it broke , and what else may be loose or disconnected . Am I going to end up with an internal propane leak that ends up causing the unit to catch on fire ? As if this is n't enough to point to poor design/build quality , the unit is entirely made of lightweight plastic . The instructions even warn not to move the unit with a tank installed . I agree with their apparent admission that the frame would not support the weight ! Perhaps an aluminum post that securely connected to the base and the head unit would be a good upgrade for them to consider.While the nearly all plastic construction was quick and easy to set up , there are no screws , no locks , nothing to hold the base , post , and head unit together . The head unit balances on the post with a short peg sliding into the support column . So the loop that looks like a handle opposite of the wheels on the base does n't really work well for lifting and rolling the unit around . First as described above , you must remove the tank , even with that weight removed , the head unit tends to lift right off the post as it is a friction only connection.Chances are some of these units will actually work , some perhaps for more than the few weeks described by other reviewers , and perhaps if this unit was under $ 200 I could understand the build quality . But at this price point and nearly every review pointing out poor quality and poor customer service , I would not recommend this unit to anyone and would be very concerned about any of their other lower cost units.The only positive note I can add for the Mosquito Magnet brand is that we have had an older design Commercial Unit Mosquito Magnet Pro in service for years . However it seems the current owners , Woodstream Company , discontinued this product when they purchased the company .	-1
Much like the other reviewers , I had a lot of difficulty to get this thing to work . I never did manage to in the end . I was hoping that they had fixed the issues with the product , but that does n't seem to be the case [ I tested it out in summer 2011 ] .Even if this unit were to function properly , it still seems expensive , especially once you add the cost of a propane tank and frequent refills . Plus you 're adding CO2 to the atmosphere - not very environmentally sound .	-1
My unit arrived at my doorstep DOA ; it had a problem with start up . When I turned it on for the first time , I had a blinking red error LED every 7 seconds after its lengthy ( approx 25min ) start up procedure . It never worked ; always had this same error light even after trying every suggestion from their customer service.I called customer service about 6-8 times ( lost count ) . They gave me tips and things to try to get it to work ; all to no avail . They were polite and professional , but extremely un-empowered . They had no or limited ability to help me . The problem is that even though they understood my problem , their management probably did n't give them the latitude to easily solve the problem . They kept putting me on hold , check with someone , then back to me and not quite sure what to do . It 's like ABC , if B is not quite what they have on their form in front of them , they are caught in an endless loop and ca n't get to C.Finally , I got sick and tired of trying to make it work and shipped it back to the company since I did n't want this big useless thing junking up my garage . They were nice & sent me a free shipping label . They did offer to `` repair '' the unit but I was so tired of dealing with this & after reading all the bad reviews , was pretty sure it 's a crap shoot to get a working machine .	-1
In order to be prepared for whatever nature threw at us , we set up the Mosquito Magnet quite early in the season . Right from the beginning , we got a red warning light , signaling that the unit was n't working . We tried to clear it but nothing seemed to work . Next , the Magnet signaled a low battery warning . Since they were new and advertised to last the season , we were a bit taken aback but my husband removed and tested them . Sure enough , they were fully charged but reinstalling them did n't help . He substituted other new batteries to no avail and then he called customer service . The woman to whom he spoke was quite pleasant but unable to provide any solutions . At one point , after he explained that our device did n't exactly resemble the pictures in the literature , she suggested that perhaps we had been sent an earlier model as if that sufficed to explain its failure.After the call , he once again removed the batteries and decided to wait a few days and try the trap again . The green light came on and we thought it was working but after going through two cycles with the attendant replacing of the propane and the lure , the Mosquito Magnet which is unobstructed and situated just a few feet from our patio area , has caught pitifully few insect pests and our yard is no more mosquito-free than it was before we set this up .	-1
This device works by sending out CO2 from a Propane tank.The thought of spending $ 20 or so and just leaking out CO2 is beyond me.I wish I had returned it on time . Now it is just clogging up my garage and I hate to even give it away or donate it .	-1
I have heard wonderful things about CO2 mosquito traps so I was thrilled to give this one a try.I ca n't even begin to tell you how frustrating my experience has been . We followed the instructions and kept getting blinking red lights ( error notification ) . We made several calls to customer service . They were friendly and helpful but nothing solved the problem.One rep suggested using a brand new propane tank . Eager to make it work we went out and bought a new tank . That still did n't help.The unit is worthless .	-1
This is sugar . Period . If you want a perfectly acceptable hummingbird nectar , put 1 part sugar - any sugar - to 4 parts water ( I usually prepare 1 cup sugar to 4 cups water ) in a microwave-safe plastic container . ( I use a juice bottle that has a flip-top pouring spout . ) Stir it . Leave the top open or off ( very important ! ) and put it in your microwave . When it comes to a boil , let it roll for about 30 seconds . ( And , of course , you can also boil it in a saucepan on the stove . ) Refrigerate it . Do not add any food coloring . It 'll keep in your frig for as long as you need it . Empty , wash and refill your feeder every two or three days to prevent mold - especially when it 's hot . if you do get a bit of mold , bleach will kill it quickly . Then wash the feeder , rinse well , refill and rehang . The hummers will love your simple , homemade nectar and you will have saved a TON of money .	-1
I have to say that I am new to the world of hummingbirds . That being said , I was fooled into thinking that I needed to purchase special `` food '' or `` sugar '' to feed the hummers . That is not true . After reading a number of sites deticated to hummingbirds , they all say to NOT purchase special sugar ... Sugar is sugar . Any fine ground sugar will make a great source of food . Save your money .	-1
For the $ 34 I paid for this , I feel seriously ripped off ! Impossible , from the photo to tell , but , I figured `` $ 34 , it ought to be a LOT 'bigger ' than this '' For what you get , a price of $ 12-13 ought to be max . There certainly is not more than $ 2 worth of plastic in it.Just feel deceived and led astray . . for the money , the consumer OUGHT to get a LOT more !	-1
This food includes a massive amt of thistle/niger seeds . I have very large variety of birds since I have a large platform feeder . The bottom is covered in those because NONE of my birds eat them . Not sure if poor quality or what , but I have to brush them out of the tray a few times a day . Basically you pay a lot and get junk . Going back to Wild Delight ... expensive but every single bit of it is eaten so worth it .	-1
These I put them last year and they were still present in my garden . Just picked them and threw them . Not sure what the contents are , and even if it is a slow release these are supposed to make the tomato plants healthier . Did not see anything ... .	-1
if this product is out of stock it should say so to not waste my time . Is it coming from China ? why two months to ship ? ? ? ? WTF ?	-1
I have had two of these now but both have come apart after about 6 months and ca n't be reassembled .	-1
These guys advertise 15 year warranty but they do n't answer the phones or emails.I have a wand that broke in one season.I thought if I pay a little more I could get good quality ... ..NOT .	-1
I was anxious to attract these glorious and wonderful birds to my porch so I thought this would be a good item for that . 1st of all , the instructions were very sketchy and I had to go to the internet to get more information on how to set up a hummingbird feeder ... .I did n't even know what to feed them , as no food was included or instructions re : the same . I knew that it was some type of sugar solution , so I found a `` recipe . '' I also was one that noticed the liquid leaked out of this , which was very distressing , but I left it up anyway . After a few days , I noticed one hummingbird , but he/she only came a few times and then lost interest in the little bit of liquid that remained ... maybe could n't get to the nectar ? ? I had also placed it on a windy porch , and with being such lightweight , flimsy plastic , it fell off and broke one day , having been attached only with a little hook that came with it.Not a good experience , and I think next time I will go with a more quality , heavier model that will last .	-1
I agree with the majority of the other reviews . This feeder initially seemed easier to use due to the twist-off top fill . However , it is very cheaply made and fragile and does not hold up well . It is a fine art to get it to the `` just right '' spot so that it does n't leak and even then it sometimes still does.Better off to spend more money on a more sturdy , better constructed feeder ( I like the glass bottle type the best , despite it being a bit of a pain to fill - at least it does n't leak out or evaporate quickly.Pass this one up .	-1
The Perky-Pet Magnolia Hummingbird Feeder looks , at first glance , like a great feeder . Similar to many modern hummingbird feeders on the market , it 's plastic , so it 's light-weight . It has perches for the hummingbirds to sit on.However , we 've been feeding hummingbirds for twenty years now , so we 've tested a wide variety of feeders . When we put this feeder out , we put it into a spot which was getting a swarm of hummingbirds . We also put one of our normal , plastic hummingbird feeders near it.The hummingbirds would examine this - but absolutely refuse to use it . They went to the other one.We switched locations . Again , they refused to use this one . They 'd try it out , try to stuff their beaks into the holes , and give up . They 'd go back to the other one which was easier to use.Finally we removed the other feeder so they were forced to use this one . They might sip for a second or two - and then they 'd take off . Yes - they will GO to it . But they wo n't actively USE it as much as they use the other feeders.We did n't have any problems with leakage . That normally happens if you do n't fill and seal a feeder properly so the vacuum is n't formed . So it 's not that leakage was a problem . It 's that the tiny hole shape was one the hummingbirds disliked . Also , I think the `` cute '' leaves on the perches make it harder for them to land.There are so many other awesome hummingbird feeders on the market that are lightweight , plastic , and that hummingbirds adore . I just do n't see any reason to use this . We experimented with it for two solid months during prime hummingbird season . The hummingbirds voted with their wings . They wanted nothing to do with this one.Normally we give away old feeders we are n't using any more , so friends can use them . This one , sadly , is going in the trash . I would n't want to subject anybody to the poor results this one gives , given how many great feeders are out there.We purchased this feeder with our own funds .	-1
I have used many feeders in my yard and sold many more at my job in the lawn & garden department . And I have seen some bad feeders , more art object than feeder , but this is without doubt the worse feeder I have ever seen and used . It has taken me several tries to keep it full and even then when the wind blows , it leaks.The whole point to this feeder is that it is supposed to be easier to use , but it is far more complicated than it needs to be . Just look at the instructions above , I have never seen a feeder so complicated.To use it correctly ; You must make sure every section is screwed as tight as possible.You must fill it completely fullYou must pull out the base to create a vacuumAnd you must hang it perfectly levelIf any of these fail , it will leak out all of the feed . The primary problem is the base unscrews into two parts for cleaning . If there was a rubber gasket between these , it would seal up much better.My advice is to avoid this product and go with the classic style feeders .	-1
I suppose it 's okay for a kid 's project or something that you do n't display proudly . It 's just so cheaply made , looks cheesy , bad plastic and it leaks . It 's only worth a couple dollars , if that . Invest in something a bit more higher quality and buy something you will enjoy looking at . The entire nectar process , filling and overall function is just a mess . But , again , for a young person 's school project , it 's a perfect choice , because you do n't care if it will ever make it home .	-1
I really WANTED to like this hummingbird feeder -- it is very cute , with vivid colors and an attractive design , and would ( visually ) be a welcome addition to anyone 's backyard.However , I am finding it very difficult to IMPOSSIBLE to keep from leaking . First of all , the one I received came with NO instructions ! But I looked the instructions up that the company provided online , Then I made the correct sugar/water mixture ( you do n't need to buy any `` hummingbird nectar '' mix - just Google `` how to make Hummingbird nectar '' and you 'll find the simple recipe : 1/4 CUP SUGAR MIXED WITH 1 CUP WATER . ( Do NOT use honey . ) The mix just contained added food coloring to make it pink.My mother and I thought we had it correctly set it up according to the ( slightly confusing ) directions , and it seemed fine . Then a few hours later , we looked outside , and it only had a inch of liquid left ! This was not because of a huge convention of hungry hummingbirds ... it had leaked all over the ground below.With some adjusting and readjusting , we did manage to get it to hold in the liquid once -- but every other time it leaked out nearly all of the nectar within a few hours . ( We ca n't figure out what we did `` right '' that one time , either ! ) Summary : PROS : - Cute design- My dog really , REALLY enjoyed lapping up the leaked sugar water from the deck below the feeder ! - We did get it to hold the liquid in ONCE ( but can not figure out what we did right that time ! ) CONS : - LEAKS LIKE CRAZY ! - Missing instructions- Confusing instructions obtained from the company- Cheap , almost `` brittle '' plastic for the clear container ( the red parts are a bit nicer ) -- I think it would break easily.- My dog is now a sugar addict from drinking the leaks . ; - ) I would not recommend this item for ANYONE to buy ! This feeder is either poorly designed , or there 's no quality control at the factory ( which is why some people seem to have gotten one that worked well . ) Steer clear of this and go for a feeder with higher reviews !	-1
***** Update 5/21/13 *****I received a new unit , Perky Pet Model 210P , from Woodstream after I called their 800 number and reported this unit defective . They offered to replace it with a new unit of the same kind , but I asked if I could get something else since this design seemed so poor . They acknowledged that the 120TF has more issues than their other models and that they could make this change for me . SO , I received the more expensive 210P and I have to say it is just great . The food does n't leak out . It has a glass vs. plastic reservoir which I believe will last longer . As a result , I would buy this brand , but avoid this model , the 120TF , and go for the 210P , which is also available on Amazon . The 210P does n't have the `` push/pull valve feature '' but my experience is that this is more trouble than help . The 210P is more `` old school '' in its design , but is by far the better feeder . *****The up front review of this item is that my sample was non-functional and that I 'm kinda stunned that the manufacturer would send a Vine reviewer something this obviously bad . I guess this speaks to the authenticity of the program in that this must have been a random unit pulled out and shipped to me . It was clearly not `` cherry picked '' .So , what was so bad ? I carefully cleaned the unit and dried it as recommended online . BTW , there were no instructions or hummingbird food included with my sample , so I had to go online for instructions for bird food , prepping the feeder , etc . After the feeder was dry , I re-assumbled it and made sure all parts were fitting as tightly as they can . I closed the feeder valve and opened the top to load it with my homemade `` nectar '' ( =1 cup pure cane sugar stirred into 1 qt . boiled water and allowed to cool ) . I half filled the clear plastic reservoir and then closed the screw top lid . After hanging it in the appointed place , I carefully opened the valve to allow feeding . This allows the nectar to flow from the clear plastic reservoir to the red plastic feeding port area . Then , all the nectar started leaking out of the seam between the top and bottom halves of the red plastic feeding port ( part with the plastic flowers ) . The top and bottoms halves of this shell have no rubber gasket or washer between then and have only a narrow plastic seam around the middle with a tiny ridge in it . This does NOT sit perfectly flush and has gaps as big as 1/32 '' even after I tried to tweak it to be tight.So , it is not just an imperfect unit , in my opinion ( I 'm one of those truly `` Dilberted '' engineering types ) it is really poorly designed . This is strange since the materials are not bad or cheap - they just had no common sense when designing this unit . It also appears that it could never have been well tested by anyone after initial design because I ca n't imagine that very many of these come off the line working properly . You would think the very first prototype batch would have failed so bad that they would have gone back and re-designed it.My brief online investigation shows that almost all other reviewers have had as bad an experience . So , why am I giving this horrible product two stars ? The answer is the customer service . Since I 'm a Vine reviewer , I always feel obligated to go another few yards ( in not a mile ) to see if the company will stand behind their products when one gets a clunker from them . The parent company of Perky Pet is Woodstream , and they put their toll free number on the bottom of the feeder . I called it and was channeled in non-geologic time ( & lt ; 5 minutes ) to a friendly , US-based customer support person . They admitted that this particular unit `` had more problems reported than others '' that they make and were willing to send me a replacement . Since I believed that this would just result in getting another bad feeder , I asked if they could send me one that works better for equivalent value . YES ! I quickly picked a high rated one off of Amazon , and they took my data down and committed to get it into UPS today . Wow ! Very cool , very positive and upbeat response.When I get the new unit , I will report here and let you all know if the new feeder is the one to get or not .	-1
Edited due to further experience with the feeder : I 've tried again and again to get this feeder to work properly . After hanging it up I discovered that the feeder leaks slowly over the course of 12 hours or so . You fill it , hang it up and it seems to be okay and then the next day the feeder is empty and there 's a big water stain underneath it . The bottom casing of the feeder needs some sort of seal to keep the contents from leaking out.Original review : This hummingbird feeder is seriously lacking for a decent set of directions on how to use it ! Written in very small print on the bottom of the feeder , the directions say to push to fill . Well it does n't say what to push to fill and since it came out of the box with it already in the fill position it took me a few minutes to figure out they 're talking about actually pulling or pushing on the clear container that holds the nectar . And when they say pull , they mean you really have to pull to get it to open ! Once I figured out the whole push/pull thing , I filled the feeder , screwed the top on and brought the feeder out to the hanger . Then I pulled the clear container up into the feed position and hung the feeder up . I can see from the other reviews that a lot of people had problems with leaking but I have to say I have had no problems at all with this feeder leaking . If you tip it once it 's in the feed position it will definitely leak so I recommend not setting it in the feed position until you 've hung it up .	-1
First off let me say that I have numerous hummingbird feeders around the yard so I do know how to properly handle them . Unfortunately no matter what I tried the darn things leaked out all of the sugar water within a half hour of putting them outside . I would have been happy if even one had worked properly but all three being bad is such a disappointment . My poor hummers are all confused now thinking they had some new feeders so there would be less fighting amongest them and more happy campers but alas it 's not to be . I will try this weekend if I have a chance to silicone the entire base of the units to see if that will help . It 's the only thing I can think of left to try . If that does n't work they will become hangers in the house with artificial flowers in them so that during the winter I can remember all my little friends that will be back with the spring flowers . I do hope some of you have better luck than I but remember there is always an alternative use for everything . Just have to put the thinking cap on and you 'll find some way in which to use them .	-1
The feeder separates into three basic parts : base with flowers , middle clear container , red lid . The base separates further into two pieces that can be screwed/unscrewed to clean out the compartment . This is the part that 's caused all the problems for me . Even when screwed closed as tightly as possible , it does not prevent the water from leaking out . The leak is a slow drip , and with the middle container filled all the way to the top , it 'll take a couple hours to empty out completely , but this is still unacceptable in my view when it leaves that much waste and mess . It leaks when it 's level , and faster when it 's tipped swaying in the wind . There 's just no way to stop it unless you take some glue or something to seal the seam between the bottom pieces - leaving you with no easy way to clean the bottom half out .	-1
this is the easiest trap to set that I 've ever had , just flip the handle up and set it where you want it . The steel appears to be non corrosive but only time will tell . It 's light weight so easy to handle . The thing I 'm disappointed in , and why I only gave it 2 stars , is the fact that we 've been shooting rabbits almost every night and quit doing that when we set the trap and baited it and it 's been a week now and no rabbits have been caught . No squirrels either and there are plenty of them around . They 're still here because you can see the damage in the garden from them . I do n't know if it 's just so small that they wo n't even try to enter it to get caught or what . We have changed the bait 3 times and you get a booklet suggesting what to use but none of it is working . A cute little trap is just a cute little trap and nothing more if it does n't work . I have the larger size of this same brand and style trap and it catches something every single day but nothing in this one . Guess I would suggest buying this brand but in a larger size .	-1
I bought this to catch squirrels , as it says it does . Two things were wrong . One is the easy set/release works great , but the trap does n't trigger and there is no way to adjust it 's sensitivity . The squirrels just helped themselves to food and left . I did not catch a single one . I have used other models with the old style and caught 16 squirrels . Also , the area behind the trap is so short that it leaves little room for bait . Because it has a wire bottom , I needed a small platform to put the food on , and then the trap was in the way . 17 '' is not long enough to do the trick . The company took it back and is sending me a refund . I bought another one that I know is tried an tested , the Havahart 1078 , 24-by-7-by-7 . I had borrowed this one from my local humane society and I know it works well .	-1
Good looking feeder , but the hummingbirds avoid it and the fluid does not flow well into the feeding tray , so the level there gets very low even when there is fluid in the bottle . Slow turnover of that fluid then results in bacteria growth inside the feeding tray , which is harmful to the birds . I would not recommend this feeder . I 've owned many hummingbird feeders and by far the very best ones are the Aspects Hummzinger feeders and those made by Best . Both are available on Amazon . They attract hummers very well , and they contain no metals ( zinc , copper , brass , lead ) that are toxic to hummingbirds .	-1
Had a cheap plastic feeder that the hummingbirds went nuts over . It eventually cracked due to sun exposure so a glass and metal feeder would be the solution to that problem right ? Well not a single hummingbird came after that even after washing and refilling it multiple times . Went back to a glass and plastic feeder this year and the hummingbirds are back .	-1
Yes , the warning about color given by other reviewers still holds true.In my case , I was trying to be very careful not to cause any color to come off . But then I tried to remove the sticker that says `` Glass '' in 3 languages . Sure enough , as I began to peel it off , I could see that the color was coming up with it ! Fortunately for me , I quit before it was off and was able to just leave it there . But I know that with time , it will continue to wear.I could not discern , from the commercial photos , that this is a flask , not a round bottle . I do n't care for the shape . Also ... even though we all know hummers CAN hover while they eat ... they 'd rather have a perch ! UPDATE : Although one reviewer said that there is no problem from mildew with these Perky Pet feeders , I was surprised this morning to discover lots of mildew on one feeder . My birds had not been using one of the feeders so I finally took it down to see why . The base was full of mildew . All around the join of the two pieces , but also on the interior around the inside edges and down around the baffles . Yes , I should have cleaned it earlier . But I just thought I 'd let folks know that mildew can take over this kind too .	-1
One would think that there 's not much to be said regarding a hummingbird feeder . Unfortunately , this hummingbird feeder merits some attention for the wrong reasons . There are some good features with this feeder , too , but the bad should not be ignored.As delivered , this is a very attractive and well-made feeder . The base is well-designed and in my observation it does not leak when properly assembled . I have read reviews that claim that this style of base ( which Perky Pet uses with more than one feeder design ) tends to leak but that has not been the case for us . I honestly believe it comes down to proper assembly.The red glass bottle is very pretty - at first . The problem is that it 's not red glass . It 's clear glass that 's simply painted red . Worse , the paint has a bad tendency to peel when wet and chip when dry . What is the point , then , if it 's not going to retain the red color ? I have a red Nalgene drinking bottle that is sturdy and scratch-resistant - why not make the feeder bottle from the same material , or use a real red glass bottle instead ? The feeder 's harness which is used to hang it up is my other major complaint . It is exposed metal , which over time will corrode and rust . It would have been a small things to either coat the harness or insulate it in plastic to make it weather resistant.My complaints would be for nothing if the hummingbirds came to this feeder . So far , we have not attracted any to this feeder , though two other feeders we have see activity all day long ( one in particular often has three or four hummingbirds on it at the same time ) .From my observations and experience , I just ca n't recommend this feeder . It 's very pretty and the base is designed well , but unfortunately it falls short on a number of other points - most important of which is the lack of hummingbird visits . Consider other feeders before trying this one . This feeder , for us , is little more than a decoration .	-1
I have used this product twice . It works well and the battery charging is fast . The edger function did not work well for me . It could be the type of grass in my lawn . Overall a good product and very ergonomic.This is an addition to my review above and a few months later . I reduced the rating for this product to one star or perhaps 0 stars . I have used it no more than five times since I bought this a few months ago . The battery just died and could not be revived even after several attempts at recharging for the specified time and more.I will stick to known and tried brands next time I buy another weed whacker.This is an addition to my review above . I was ready to throw this weed whacker when I saw the worx website on the warranty card . It has a two year warranty . In the worx website was a link to battery trouble shooting . After I put in the battery 's serial # and model # I was taken to a free battery replacement order form . It seems to me they know about this battery problem and is replacing those thru their website . I am waiting for the delivery of the replacement battery.Another addition to my review . Have received the battery replacement and so far after several weeks , the new battery is keeping it 's charge .	-1
I was n't aware it only held niger seed . None of the birds that come to my feeders eat niger including the American Goldfinches . The other problem was for it to work the squirrels had to come from the top . Mine all come from below .	-1
Looks nice and holds good amount of water , but , the water spills everywhere . Thought it would be better but was disappointed . I would try other watering cans	-1
The handle design is pretty good and easy to manipulate the can . However the real problem is that the spout is designed to come off so that you can turn it to pour or shower . The problem is that if you tilt the can too much , then the detachable spout just pops off and the water comes out so fast that it digs a hole..The next problem is that the glue failed on the orange cap and it just falls off . So the can is nearly useless . So far every fiskars can that I 've ever had has falled apart , split , etc . Wo n't waste my time with any more of them .	-1
I knew I 'd lost the game when I saw these worms on the surface the next morning . Yeah , the moles just moved them out of their run and left them on the ground .	-1
Apparently this product is not on the menu for the moles in my area . I would check every few days and they just decomposed .	-1
I am senior it is too heavy to roll when the bin is full.I should get the spin one well it is too much to be buy another one you never know other problem . The way is leave all compost on the floor and turn it .	-1
I have an occasional problem with fruit flies and gnats in an office and though I assume there 's a food source , I have n't found it so I 've tried a couple of things to get them under control . I 've tried the classic vinegar in a dish , wine in a dish and fly paper . They all work in part , of those three the traditional strip of fly paper works best but not well.The Terro is relatively expensive at a little over $ 7 each with the packaging recommendation that it be discarded after 30 days , so basically $ 7/month . I also have a Fly Web Fly Trap ( Amazon ) so decided to compare them . I started with a clean sheet of sticky paper in the Fly Web and the fresh Terro Fruit Fly Trap , placing them about 5 ' apart . I left them for a month.There were 5 fruit flies or gnats in the Terro , I quit counting at 100 on the Fly Web , but definitely a lot more.The good news is that between the two , there are no more gnats or fruit flies in the office.The Fly Web Trap draws 8 watts of electricity so just under 6 kilowatt hours for a month , our local rate is 8.1 cents per kwh , so it costs about 50 cents a month to run . The sticky paper lasts for months , so throw in another 50 cents a month for a high estimate of $ 1 per month to operate . Plus , there 's no smell . It is a tad messier to dispose of the paper.The Terro liquid smells like vinegar so other than the convenient holder and easy disposal , it does n't seem to be much different or work any better or worse than a small bowl with vinegar .	-1
I received this fruit fly trap about a month ago in late August . Here in Silicon Valley , CA , this is NORMALLY a warm time of year with a fair number of the little buggers around pestering the bananas we leave out on the counter . This year was a bit cooler and we did n't have a good baseline density of flies , so we were unable to give the TERRO a really great test . In fact , the few fruit flies we had seemed to avoid it.The instructions for set up are clear . The bait fluid comes pre-mixed and contained in a squeeze bottle that makes it easy to fill the trap itself . I 'm sad that this creates another small landfill item - as does the trap itself - but it is recyclable in our waste service , so perhaps that 's OK.I 'm giving this a two star rating because , although it did n't get the few flies we had , the fact is they were really sparse this year so perhaps it would do better if there were more . If not for this , I would give it a one star rating because it did not catch anything , even other insect types.I 'm keeping the trap out until it dries up . If something changes , I will update the review .	-1
You catch more bees with honey , but you catch NO fruit flies with this trap . Seriously , it caught not a single fly .	-1
As a billion other people have already commented , and I will try not to rehash , you can use cheap and common ingredients you already have to achieve the same thing.So maybe buy ONE of these for the original container/trap , then refill with your own `` special sauce '' ( vinegar + water + dishwashing liquid ) .Actually this little deal worked so well that before I read the other reviews , and after our trap had expired , as it were , I searched by the company name to see if they sold refills ( wanting to buy more ) . NOPE ! Considering the unit only lasts for 30 days ( ours lasted much less time ) , they want you to buy a new wasteful little plastic unit every 25 days , @ $ 7 a pop ? Insane . Even the least intelligent among us would soon figure out that that is a TERRIBLE deal for consumers . At least they should sell a multi pack or something - maybe a pack of a dozen.OTOH , maybe most customers do n't have as much fruit in their house as we do , on a continual basis , which constantly keeps these little buggers around.I also saw that this company has both fly traps , and moth traps , which would be useful . How great would it be if they could make One Trap To Rule Them All , as it were ? THAT would be a great product that I would consider buying.Unfortunately , can only give 2 stars here due to crazy residual cost , wasteful design ( to be replaced/thrown away every month ) , and the fact that it 's so simple to make your own trap . Hard to see a reason for this product to exist ( but I AM interested in their moth trap ! )	-1
This time of year is harvest time . That means various things . There are many vegetables that pass through our kitchen . There is a lot of chopping , cooking , canning , and preserving going on . In addition to that whole scenario , there is one more thing that is almost overwhelming at times- FRUIT FLIES.The Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap seemed like a godsend . I could not wait to use it . I was disappointed , however , when I saw that you get this little plastic apple like thing , and inside is a wick . There is a little squeeze bottle of oil that you put in the plastic apple and the idea is that you leave it standing upright in a place where the flies are and let it attract them . They stay trapped inside and can not reproduce.PROSThis does attract a lot of fliesIt is non-toxicIt is small to put in handy placesDoes trap fruit fliesCONSIs one time use onlyCan be tipped over easilyWastefulNeed to have a LOT of them to be effectiveIf these were re-useable , I would get them again for sure . I do n't think they are cost effective , however , and do n't like the fact that you have to keep throwing them away and use a lot of them to keep fruit flies down especially during harvest time.I only have one , and it has put a very slight dent in our fruit fly population , which means I would need a LOT of them to truly work . This is fine if you have occasional flare ups of fruit flies . If you have a bigger problem , however , they are not practical or cost effective , I do n't think .	-1
Terro insect killer products tend to be pretty effective and reliable , so I thought this product would be very useful . Normally during fruit fly season , I fill small ramekins with a mixture of cider vinegar and dishwashing liquid . The result can be unappealing , but the mixture is very effective . The little plastic apple dispenser is much cuter than my usual method . The solution in the kit just fills the little apple . Certainly , the solution attracts fruit flies , but not all that well . Terro 's instructions suggest that the solution works for a month . Maybe not so much . After a few days , I put the little apple side by side with my usual ramekin of cider and soap , and guess which one attracted more fruit flies . Yep . I might keep the little apple anyway , though -- I 'm sure that once I dump out the Terro solution and rinse it , my usual mix will do just fine .	-1
I have a big issue with Ga fruit flies , but this product is practically the same as an entire gallon of red apple vinegars . Nothing magical or special here ... .it is basically the same as using red apple vinegar and a little dish detergent .	-1
I have used the Terro ant formula and was so pleased . I have n't tried this out yet but I expect it will do the job ! The only thing I had a problem with is releasing the lid ... Be careful and just pull on the leaf , and it will release . Jesus ' Blessings and Peace ... .. I have reviewed the other comments and I 'm just wondering if the covering makes a difference . There were not clear instructions at first I thought I was suposto remove the covering around the apple , but then my husband was able to life the lid without removing the covering . I 'm wondering if the product works if you remove the covering ? I do like the idea of the vinegar in water , I hav n't tried that yet either so I ca n't comment on it . If there are any changes I will post again ! Jesus ' Blessings and Peace	-1
This is a little globe containing a funnel ( to trap fruit flies : they fly in but ca n't fly out ) , into which you squirt some vinegar.It 's totally useless . Fruit flies will totally ignore it , and will land instead on your fruits and vegetables . Even if you put this directly next to fruit fly habitat , they will entirely ignore it.The only upside is that it 's nontoxic .	-1
So , we keep fruit and veggies in wire bowls on our kitchen counter . We had a fruit fly problem recently as a result . I was thrilled to receive this , in hopes that it would make a bigger dent in our fruit fly problem than our current strategies / actions / solutions . Sadly , it did not.Now , it definitely DID catch fruit flies - just not enough to really matter , not particularly quickly , and not in the same quantities as basic homemade solutions did.On the whole , I was disappointed . Compared to putting some wine in a clear container , sealing it with Saran wrap , and punching a few holes in the Saran wrap for the flies to get in ( but not out ) , this product just did n't hold up . In one or two days of the homebased solution we caught multiples of the fruit flies we caught using this Terro Fuit Fly Trap . Plus , the Terro trap is a one-time only / disposable deal , which is n't exactly my favorite thing.So , while it did work somewhat , it really was n't enough for me . I was n't impressed . So , I 'm giving 2 stars - it worked , a little , but not enough for me to purchase in the future .	-1
Elsewhere on Amazon these same staples are described as 5 & # 34 ; long . They 're not . They 're barely over 31/2 & # 34 ; , very lightweight and flimsy . They could be used in soft ground without rocks and where strong holding power is n't necessary , but otherwise I would n't use them .	-1
These are only 4 '' long , not enough to hold much of anything . Do n't bother with these.I am annoyed that nowhere in the description do they state that the size of the pins , so I am uploading a photo of one next to a ruler , hoping to prevent others from making the same mistake.UPDATE : Within a few days they started rusting too . I was going to try to use these for other simple things - no more .	-1
Because it was billed as a safe and organic product , I first used Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray on some pesky flies on my indoor plants . While I realize that the product is n't really designed to kill the larva that are in the soil , it did n't even kill the flying adults - even when I sprayed them directly onto the bugs . I also used the product on the aphids that were eating my roses and again there was no affect . After going 0-2 , and it was n't for underuse - I repeatedly sprayed mass quantities on the bugs - I decided to throw the product away and invest in something that would actually kill garden pests.Safer , organic , or not , I see no reason to spend $ 13 on a product that does n't work - and the Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray does n't cut the mustard !	-1
I rarely use chemicals or pesticides in the garden but had the opportunity to give this product a try . I have a perennial Rose Mallow ( hibiscus moscheutos ) whose leaves get devoured yearly by the caterpillar of the sawfly . I 've tried handpicking , but they just keep coming . I used this product specifically for the leaf eating caterpillars it says it controls . It did not . After one weeks use , there were still caterpillars eating the sprayed leaves , the few I chose to spray daily .	-1
UPDATE : Several weeks after spraying my rose leaves with this product , I noticed that they are in much worse shape than they 'd normally be now , in this first blooming cycle after winter dormancy . I ca n't say for sure it is this spray , but I ca n't think of any other factors . The leaves have been eaten by something , in a `` lacy '' pattern . Do n't think I 'll be using this product on my roses again ; maybe on other hardier plants. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I 've used Safer brand products for at least 20 years . Sometimes I 'll just mix up some homemade soap solution , and that will work just fine.But some garden phenomenon require a few relatively benign chemicals . Trouble is , most products have way too many , and this spells trouble for beneficial insects and up the food chain.This product contains everything I 'd normally use in the garden but no more , and I do n't have to mix myself !	-1
Last summer I spent more time than I care to think about wondering what was causing my zucchini plants to die from the bottom up , and picking caterpillars off my kale and collards . I was n't really interested in repeating either experience , so I was thrilled to find this.I 've been applying regularly , re-applying after rain ( not that we 've had any ) and watering , and ... .watching my kale getting eaten by caterpillars . Those little green ones that are supposed to be easily killed with BT . But I guess not with this . Even spraying it directly on them does n't seem to have an effect.As for the zucchini , I 'm not really sure what 's going on . It does n't appear to have that stem worm thing , or at least I ca n't find an entry slit , but it 's definitely not doing well . This may not be the spray 's fault , but having seen no evidence that this is improving anything , I 'm afraid I wo n't be spending any money on it . : - (	-1
I 've tried a lot of pesticides , and to be honest , most of them are n't very successful . The best luck I 've had is with Ortho RosePride Insect , Disease & Mite Control Aerosol , but the scent is so strong you need to wear a mask/eye goggles to spray it ( in my opinion ) and you can not safely use it indoors . ( As a general aside , the effectiveness of pesticide seems to be directly proportional to how severe the headache you get from the pesticide/scent when you use it . ) This left me in a quandary , since my mealy bug/spider mite problem on my indoor citrus and coffee trees was horrible all winter . I did use the Safer product until I ran out of it , and it was initially moderately successful on the spider mites . It did not , however , work at all on the mealy bugs , and the spider mites seemed to build up resistance to it . I was left using rubbing alcohol soaked paper towels to scrub each leaf and stem of my indoor coffee , citrus and other plants at least once a month . Unless you have a mild infestation of an easy to kill bug , do n't bother .	-1
I hesitate to review this product before I have given it the COMPLETE test ( my aphids do n't show up until the hostas bloom ) but I think there are a few things which should be mentioned BEFORE you buy . I will be back to update this review later.This product is safe for children and pets BUT do n't get it in your pond . DO N'T use until four weeks after you have used an oil spray . DO N'T use in full sun or on cuttings or plants stressed by drought . DO N'T use on sulfur sensitive plants : delicate fern , apricots , filberts , stock , walnuts , nasturtium , sweet pea , violet , mountain ash , japanese maple , horse chestnut , spinach , viburnum . DO N'T use on strawberries which will be canned . Does this mean jam ? I have a dwarf peach which is fine until the peaches start to ripen then it gets some kind of fungus on the fruit . I had hoped this would help but peach is n't mentioned in the list of plants . When I called customer service they said no DO N'T use on peach trees . sigh ... I live in a climate where spring has hot days and cool humid nights so my roses leaf out , bloom once then give in to blackspot . Nothing has ever helped . If this works I will be back to report a miracle.May 18.. I 'm back as promised and I 'm sorry that the only thing positive I can say about the spray is it does n't have a disagreeable odor but then neither does water . Since the other reviews seem to all be positive maybe it 's just me . I used the spray ever five days and still some of my roses are stripped bare , some with blackspot starting . This morning I found a little persimmon tree with lots of little green worms rolled up in the new leaves . I unrolled the leaves and sprayed the spray directly on the worms . Maybe I heard a faint gasp as the cold spray hit them but when I went back thirty minutes later they were just as active as ever so I had to pick them off individually and stomp them . I wish I could say something good about the spray but I can only give an honest report as to how it worked for ME .	-1
Too small and flimsy ; is there a larger and more sturdier tray out there ? ? ?	-1
There is a version with holes but this one 's not supposed to have any . Mine did , just because the plastic it 's made of is so incredibly thin that I guess not enough molten plastic got into the mold to completely cover a corner of it . You can flap this thing around like a dishrag . If ( that 's IF ) you get a watertight one and do n't plan to ever move it , it may ( that 's MAY ) be suitable to hold some plants . If you attempt to move it with anything in it ( like , you know , water or plants ) , be assured that it will deform/collapse and spill whatever 's in it.I had a lot better results with some similarly sized plastic storage containers from Target that are very sturdy , very waterproof and cheaper ( taking shipping into account ) .	-1
I had these things all over my house , inside and out . Did NOTHING to control the sugar ants in Florida . Maybe a different type of ant is attracted to these but for those tiny little ants in Florida , Terro liquid baits work the best . The ants pay zero attention to these Combat baits .	-1
I placed six of these around my ants . They were surrounded . They walked under , around and over , but never in . so i went to a store and got terro liquid ant baits ( the same type thing ) . the ants immediately went running for the things and crawled all over themselves trying to get in . Then they went out and off to their & # 34 ; hive & # 34 ; . Combat did absolutely nothing for me , and I can only wonder at the other positive reviews !	-1
I was anxious to get this shredder and grind up some magnolia leaves which fall down all year long . I began to assemble the stand as instructed in the guide . The stand has three legs permanently attached to the stand and three leg extensions which are inserted into the bottom of the legs and kept in place with a spring loaded button which fits into a hole in the legs . When I removed the packing from the extensions I noticed that the portions of the extensions that slide into the legs had marks that one would expect to see on extensions that had been previously used but not on new merchandise . However , I wanted the shredder so I proceeded with assembly . Two of the extensions installed without incident . The third extension had no visible button . Looking down into the extension I could see some metal pieces which were close to the opening . It was visible that part of the spring mechanism was broken in two . This factor along with the marred surfaces led me to believe that I had received a previously owned item that had been returned . Since I could not use the shredder with just two legs and had no way to repair it I had to return it to Amazon.The Amazon return process is nothing short of amazing . In just a few minutes I had printed out the return label and was on my way to the UPS Store .	-1
I put the machine together and got ready to test . I have some banana trees and the leaves fill a garbage can real quick . I put one leaf in and turned to get another . When I looked back the first leaf had disappeared . Where could it have gone . The adds say 11 to 1 compression . Not banana leaves , more like 100 to one . I have a lot of fruit trees and I use grass clipping , leaves and tree trimming for mulch and fertilzer . This works great . You should see the size and quanity of my fruit . I had a schreder and mulcher before but I put orange branches in it and that was the end of my Black and Decker schreder . Black and Decker did not support the repair . It broke the bearings and burned up the motor on my B & D ; unit . This machine goes thru stringer line kind of fast when used with branches . But Home Depot has new line rather cheap compared with buying that line that comes with the machine.I bought a garbage pail and put it under the machine . It collects my schreded stuff and allows me to spread it around the gardern.EDIT : After using it for a while I have found that this thing is usless for anything but small jobs with leafs only.. The slightest twig will break the leading strilng cutter . The training string cutter will just break itself immediately . The 13 inch string folds in two . See the illustration in the add for how it is assemble . I tried larger string ( comes with .080 and I tried 0.095 ) and found no difference in performance . If you have much work to do you need to go to HomeDepot and by a large spool of string.EDIT 2 : I called the company and asked for help . I asked it there was some way to add a steel blade . They said no . My leaf eater should be renamed string eater . I tried steel wire and it cut beautifully for 15 seconds and then the wires dissapeared like the string . The customer service at the company stated my leaves are to strenous for it . Or may it is not suitable for my work . I tried tying the string together where it comes out of the center disk and it helped a little but not much .	-1
I have a deck with six inch railings with wood slats between the main posts . The flower box is attractive and pretty well built . However , the bracket for attachment is nearly worthless . There is nothing to hold the box in place other then the weight of the box against the vertical railings . The bracket is a 90 degree angle and therefore with any weight becomes merely a friction point for the box holding it in place . This just wo n't work for me . You could put a deck screw into the bracket to fix it in place , but then that means that I have to accommodate a poorly designed product . Into the garbage for me . Sorry , ca n't recommend it at all .	-1
I expanded this to maximum length ( 36 '' ) to hold my 36 '' planter that already had herbs growing in it . Our railing is 3.5 inches wide . The screws are metal but the caps are plastic ( my husband said that plastic on metal usually causes stripping of the screws ) . Well , as soon as we hung it , it started tipping under the weight and it fell off before we could stop it and our basil , mint , and chives were smashed under potting soil . Also , because our railing has posts , there is a C shaped loop ( not shown ) that prevents the planter from resting flush to the rail . I think because the brackets are so close together , the longer you extend the planter , the harder to evenly distribute the weight . So bummed this did n't work for us . I would n't suggest to anyone unless you can buy and try and easily return if it does n't work for you .	-1
Although the size of each part of this hoe is substantial , the short stocky handle is n't attached well to the hoe blade.It is the perfect length for working on your knees and doing detail work around your plants.Unfortunately the detail work will likely be repair of the hoe.If the price is right , it is n't a bad purchase if you are ready for some basic tweaking like some polyurethane glue , perhaps a screw , and a little file work on the blade .	-1
This little weeding hoe is the perfect size for a small garden ; its short handle means you 'll be squatting as you hoe , but when there 's not much to weed , it 's not an issue for me . The handle is fine , easy to grip . Like the leather loop for hanging . But it gets three stars because upon arrival , the thing was already broken . The end of the tool , where metal hood meets wooden handle had come unglued , leaving me to wonder : why did n't the manufacturer adhere the hood with a screw instead of simply gluing it ? The hoe still works , but I 'm skeptical of its longevity . Not recommended .	-1
When I think weeding , I think small weeds that need to be pulled . This Weeding Hoe is for huge weeds or digging up small spaces . For those activities , this is a good product -- but not for weeding small weeds . I did use it to dig up a nasty thistle -- they are huge , with prickers and deep roots . For that job , this was perfect . Use this to loosen soil or dig in small areas.Just used this product a second time and the end popped off . They should have welded it on .	-1
I live in Minnesota and during the peak period of the summer you can lose pints of blood from the mosquitoes . So , anytime something comes along that can help us enjoy the outside without needing a blood transfusion we are all ears.Unfortunately , this may be a good idea , but the over all execution and price puts this way down on my list.If the initial cost is n't enough you need to buy propane , filter , power it , etc . It just seems like a very high unneeded cost when everything is factored in.Did it actually help with the mosquito problem . If it did it was marginal at best . We still spent time swatting the bugs . To me and a couple others even after 2-3 weeks there was no noticeable difference.If it was left to me , I would stick to traditional spray and a bug zapper . At least it 's cheaper .	-1
Two summers ago I was so excited to get this . I live in a small town in Northern Minnesota , along the North Shore . With Lake Superior in front of us , and the forest behind us , we have no shortage of mosquitoes here . People from Minnesota often joke about how the mosquito is our state bird , because they are so large and abundant here . I could n't wait to try this Mosquito Magnet out , and assumed I would be emptying the trap of bugs constantly.When it arrived , I sat down with the instructions for putting it together and setting it all up . Everything went together perfectly and when I turned it on I could hear the fan/motor running . I then turned it off , picked up the packing materials and threw them in the trash . About an hour later , I went back outside to our ( fenced in ) back yard where the Mosquito Magnet was set up and turned it on . Nothing happened . I tested the power cord , it was getting electricity . I was stumped , so I went inside and started reading the handbook that came with the unit , going through the trouble shooting section.After going through every possible fix in the handbook , I went to the Mosquito Magnet website . I thought perhaps there they may have some ideas . I was thrilled to find instructional videos on troubleshooting this very problem . I watched them all , and tried every fix suggested . Nothing worked , so I went in and watched them again to see if there was something I had missed . I tried everything , from clearing the propane lines to getting a brand new tank . I even tried the suggested fix of picking it up ( and it 's heavy ) and shaking it , so that the weights on the inside would be evenly distributed again . I worked on it for days . Then when I gave up , my husband worked on it . When he gave up , my father ( someone who can fix just about anything ) had a go at it . After my father tinkered with it for a week , he gave it back to me , having no luck . I put it away for the summer , and brought it out again this summer . I found it and decided I needed to ether get it working , or get rid of it . So after fiddling with it all over again , and still having no luck , I 've determined it 's dead . The motor is the only thing not working . Everything is receiving power and all the lines are clear , with all new equipment attached to it . Unfortunately , it appears the motor only worked for 2 minutes before completely failing . This was very disappointing .	-1
Came across mine today while cleaning out the garage and thought I would come here to see what others thought about this waste of money . Mine worked ok the first year but not for all the trouble and expense to maintain . Next year would n't work no matter what ! Been in the Garage for 2 or 3 yrs . I 'm throwing it away today !	-1
I believe Wolf Creek was the vendor from whom I purchased this , but I just used this instant piece of garbage for the first time today . The top would not screw on properly . It was missing the & # 34 ; straw & # 34 ; to connect to the hole in the lid , so I substituted a heavy duty one of my own . It was a snug fit , too . The unit would not operate in an upright position . When flipped upside-down , it leaked the very fine sulfur dust I was using from every crevice BUT the one it was designed for . Mine was whitish-clear plastic , so perhaps the one in the display picture has been improved upon , but it was a & # 34 ; Pest Pistol. & # 34 ; I feel scammed out of the purchase price .	-1
I received mine , it came with a usermanual ( with some errors in it ) , the main device , and wheels , handle , and some other smaller tools ( 2 plastic rings I do n't know what they are for , as they are n't being specified in the user manual ) .It also comes with 2 hexagon rods ( which are not necessary unless you replace the blades , and even then one would have been sufficient ) , a wrench ( 2 are needed to mount the wheels ) , and it 's lacking a cross ( philips ) screwdriver to mount the top.After about 5 minutes of following the user manual to the letter , the device is installed . 2 errors however , one being that I did not see a safety switch in the device when unmounting the top hopper , which was not described , and I presume is the black plastic cover to keep you from sticking your hands in the device . And second , the motor overload protection switch says it only goes off when the motor gets jammed or overheated ; which in my case was hardly the case ! I plugged in the device after mounting it , and turned it on . The device appears to work , but the overload protection switch kicks in , and shuts down the engine after 5 seconds ! I can clearly hear from the engine , that the blades are free , and the engine is not jammed ! Neither can the engine be overheated , because the device is still cold ! It does not seem to matter whether I stick a branch under little force in the device , or leave it running without load ; the device shuts down on me ! I received this device , and used it no longer than 20 seconds , and I will be sending it back with Amazon , and hope for a refund , since it seems like I can not exchange this device for a similar one ( Amazon webpage error ) ! I presume it was a one device issue , but since I ca n't receive a similar device back , I 'll ask for a full refund , and save my money for a more advanced model , with better reviews !	-1
Chips really well BUT the parts are worthless . On my third session the V-cutter disintegrated ; since the cutters are not warranted I contacted MAXTool ( Amazon obtained it from MAXTool ) and ordered a new cutter . After installation , on my forth session , the square bushing , part # 6156-200001 , disintegrated and this time MAXTool told me that this was a known problem part ; however none were in stock and they had no information on when , or if , the part would be available . Works great when it works ; but sadly it does n't work reliably and parts are not available . Do not buy this chipper ! KUDO 's to Amazon , when I emailed them about this problem , even though I was out of the 30 day return window , I immediately got an email authorizing free UPS return and a refund . Lousy product but great Amazon customer service ; especially in light of useless MAXTool customer service .	-1
If you have a GS 40 , this cover will not work . Also , the cover seems to be cheaply made from flisy material , definitely not worth the money . I bought a cover for a small Char Grill propane grill , much higher quality cover for less money and works very well on the GS 40 .	-1
Way overpriced . I suggest you buy a tarp and use it with a couple of bungee cords at least that will last longer . The cover feels like it will tear at any moment whenever it snags on the back bar of the smoker . Its too thin and could use another layer as thick as it already comes to give it a longer life for the price you pay . It does fit nice and snug though . The round black kettle grill company ( catch my drift here ) makes better covers but of course that isnt going to work on this smoker .	-1
First of all , the seller was great . The product was received in good condition and shipment was very fast.That said , inside the box is a warning that the product is for & # 34 ; indoor domestic use only. & # 34 ; Additionally , there are warnings that it contains lead and other toxins and that you should wash your hands after using it.The product is thin , looks to be easily torn ... .etc etc.In other words , I could take a dry cleaning bag and cover the smoker and at least I would n't have to worry about lead .	-1
This thing is a waste of money for your 30 & # 34 ; Masterbuilt smoker . It is of cheap material . Easily blows off if you live in a windy area ( like I do ) and will certainly degrade quickly in the elements . If I had to do it over I would n't waste my $ on this . If it was half the price I would buy several but for what they are charging you are better off coming up with a cover solution of your own .	-1
If you are lucky in your lifetime to have only a couple of mice , you might like this , but seriously , most people have continuous mice ; they just disappear for a short time . The cost of this trap will run you broke if you try to catch a field of mice.Marketing - keeping the parasites insideThe most exciting thing about this newfangled mouse ( tiny ) trap is that it can catch a mouse and you will never see it ! The marketing design is that trapping a mouse keeps any diseases and parasites inside . I have lived around mice all my life and never once worried about the parasites leaking from mice . My hot button is trapping a mouse inside and never seeing it.CAT : 3 mice VS Newfangled Traps : 0I have had this trap out for a few weeks now in outside locations that I know mice frequent , simply because CAT has told me there are mice here and there . Well , CAT has found and caught a couple and the high falutin ' newfangled expensive trap is empty.Expensive plasticThe plastic holds a steel bar that will instantly and `` humanely '' kill a mouse , provided he is small enough to get into the opening which is 1x1 inch . I do n't know of anyone who has one mouse , two mice , three mice . Generally people have many mice to contend with . These traps appear expensive if you believe you have a field of mice to catch . Plus , the opening for the mice to enter is quite small , 1x1 inch opening.Peanut butterThe package advises the use of peanut butter on the tip of an opening which you would unscrew . I have never used peanut butter for mice , but will try anything.Once I catch a mouse , I will update the review , but for now , CAT still has a job to do . ... .Rizzo	-1
These traps are ridiculously expensive ! If you have many mice , you might go broke buying traps . At $ 4.45 per trap , I thought maybe I should do something with the mouse after I caught it . My husband will eat anything , but even he is not interested in Mouse Soup.My other problem with this trap is that it is just more plastic junk to fill up landfills.The best mouse trap I have found isd-CON 00027 Ultra Set Covered Mouse Trapand it is reusable . You can also go with the old reliableVictor M038 Easy Set Mouse Trap , 4-Packfor a really inexpensive trap . These are my husband 's favorite .	-1
This seems like a wonderful idea and , in theory , it really is . Unfortunately , the traps ( at least in our use ) did not catch anything but our time wasted in setting them up . We followed directions carefully to place the pb in the hatch and we made sure the door faced the wall but the traps just did not work . Save your money -- you are better off with snap traps , sticky pads , humane traps , or even an exterminator .	-1
I have some rural property and mice have been an issue . Luckily , the dogs usually take care of the outdoor mice , but there is the matter of the occasional mouse coming inside.This trap initially looked promising because you do n't have to worry about the danger of tradtional traps with the sensitive settings that can cause serious injury . In the past , I have had such traps , but always had them pre-set in the store so as to prevent injury . When a mouse was caught , I 'd have the neighborhood exterminator properly dispose of it and re-set the trap.With this , you dodge the glue and sensitive spring bullets . As noted in another U.S. review , one trap actually caught mice whereas the others were food stops for hungry rodents . Since these traps ARE made of plastic , they do not have the same level of durability as the metal Hav-A-Heart traps that I have been using all along . The Hav-A-Hearts actually CAPTURE errant rodents and you can then dispose of them as gently as you choose.Unlike the Hav-A-Hearts , which are made entirely of metal , this style of trap is pure plastic and the little lever the animal has to run over to get to the food does not always work.While I think this is an unpredictable product at worst and mediocre at best , I will stick with the Hav-A-Heart traps as they have a very high batting average and are extremely effective . The Hav-A-Hearts are a bit pricey , but they ARE worth it and they DO work .	-1
As someone else noted , the mechanism in these traps does n't seem to work at all . I loaded both traps 3 times and found that the mice got in , took the PB , and left little mouse pebbles inside , around , and ... wait for it ... even on top of the traps . I guess this last act was the ultimate review of this device.In concept , these sounded great . In reality , I 'm going back to the old spring loaded traps . Still waiting for the better mousetrap !	-1
There 's a saying that if you want to make money , you need to build a better mouse trap . Victor has been building mouse traps for many years and this year build a new mouse trap , one that is a lock down model that seals in the dead mouse and all of its problems - problem is that is not a better mouse trap . And it 's much , much more expensive . I figure if you all you want to do is to feed and house your mice , go ahead and buy the expense condo model.Test setup:1 ) Two older Victor mouse traps and two new mouse `` condo '' traps . I used peanut butter for the bait and set all four in my shed where the mice had nested in my Toro Walk-behind lawnmower - but that is another story . Yes , when you pull the cord and start it , they come flying out - and no mice were harmed in this fiasco . Although they did stare at me with an attitude.2 ) I came back the next day and counted my mice . The older traps killed two mice ( one each ) and the newer , gentler model killed one . However , the one that remained unsprung was missing its bait . Licked off the peanut butter clean as a whistle.3 ) Re-set two more reliable older models and the sprung and reset the newer , mouse motel model - with the dining room option.4 ) Came back for the body count the next day . The two older models had one mouse each - dead of course . However , the newer patio model with the now empty dining car was still without a mouse - but it now offered mouse dropping in the entrance hall just to make sure that I knew that we housed and fed one guest.Conclusions : Save your money and buy the old , cheap stand by wooden traps that work . If you ca n't stand to see a dead mouse and are afraid of all the possible parasites , mites , ticks , etc. , then be ready to spend your retirement money attempting to catch them all in these bed and breakfast models .	-1
It 's been loaded with peanut butter from 9/27/10 until today , which is a bit over 2 months , and it has n't caught a mouse . This mousetrap does n't work . It was moved around to various places throughout the house and no mice were caught.Finally , after becoming frustrated with this item , I tried inexpensive mice pellets and that seemed to do the trick.This item is expensive and it does n't seem to catch mice . I would n't pay a penny for it . The mice are probably getting a good laugh out of this contraption . Not recommended ! Zero stars .	-1
When we first got these , I was shocked at how wasteful they were . In fact , my husband continually ranted about how un-green these traps are . If you happen to get one mouse caught in a trap , you have to throw away the whole thing- so now they expect us to buy little mouse coffins out of fear of contamination ? Then we discovered the mice in the attic . They are still having a party , leaving their mini tootsie roll trails while our remaining trap sits as a mouse hotel , shouting , `` Come on in , rest your feet and have some peanut butter ! `` And by the way , if you happen to knock a set trap or drop it by accident , it trips the trap and then one of your lovely little mouse coffin goes empty to the dump . You can not reset.These traps are a waste . They might isolate an occasional mouse from being seen or touched when dead , but what good is that if the rest of the mice run free and destroy the house while feasting at their peanut butter hotels ? That hardly sounds sanitary !	-1
I 've used the no-see-um disposable traps before ( DCon and Tomcat ) . While they seemed wasteful and expensive , they were both quick and effective . This thing , on the other hand , is worse than useless.It 's just getting cold here and I live in the country , so mice are starting to venture in for the winter . Typically we see some mouse activity just when it cools off , then set out a bunch of traps , and they 're either all killed off or find a more hospitable home for the winter . I 've had both traps out for 2 weeks and not a mouse in them . Last night , I saw a mouse on the loose . When I checked my traps , there was mouse poop INSIDE one of them , and a smear of stolen peanut butter on the inside near the door of the other ! With the design of the thing and the way you bait it , the only way to get peanut butter there is for someone to go inside and leave with it ! The D-Con No View , No Touch Mouse Trap much better . It does n't seal in the mouse with all its perilous mouse cooties ( but then , neither does this one ) , but it 's an effective no-see , no touch disposable traps.Two no-touch reusables that work well are d-CON 00027 Ultra Set Covered Mouse Trap and Victor M252 Electronic Mouse Trap .	-1
Emerson is quoted as saying , `` Build a better mousetrap , and the world will beat a path to your door . `` If Emerson had been an economist instead of a poet , he might have added an asterisk to the end of that statement and stipulated that this `` better mousetrap '' must be practical . Stunning the mice with nuggets of gold and a slingshot might be effective , but too expensive to be practical . Killing mice with a-bombs would be extremely effective , but still impractical.So what about the Victor M265 Mouse Trap ? Well , it 's comparably cheaper than nuggets of gold and far less collateral damage than an a-bomb , but it still has some problems.First you have to ask yourself , `` how much do I hate mice ? '' If your answer is , `` about $ 4 apiece '' , then you 're OK.Next ask yourself , `` how green am I ? '' If your answer is , `` who cares -- my house is infested with mice ! ! ! `` , then you 're still OK.But if you think $ 4/mouse is too steep and if you 're uncomfortable using this much consumer plastic one time and then throwing it away , then you 'll want to consider another option.Having said all that , the Victor M265 is effective and tidy . Stick a little bait inside ( my mice like the crust trimmed off their PB & J ; ) and set it out where the mice like to party . Check back tomorrow and you 've got yourself a mouse . Toss the whole gizmo in the garbage and do n't give it another thought . Remember , the mouse corpse inside means you ca n't dispose of the used trap in the recycling ... not that I 've tried .	-1
I had the perfect testing ground for these traps , a rural home with a fall invasion of field mice . The contenders ; Tomcat glue traps - a low tray filled with a sticky material that trap the mice when they walk on it , Kness Snap-E mouse trap ; snap type traps that catch the mouse under a metal bar , the Victor Kill & Seal traps and a low tech trap involving a 5 gallon bucket with a wood board leaning up against the side and baited with peanut butter . You put a few inches of water in the bucket if you do n't want to catch and release.I moved the different traps around in areas where there had been mouse activity so there would be no placement bias in the testing.The K & S ; traps have very small openings for the mouse entry ( 11/16 by 11/16 ) and the bait plug ( 7/16 inch . You bait these traps by unscrewing a very small plug and putting some bait on it , I used peanut butter , and screwing it back in . It holds about 1/4 tsp of peanut butter . You move a lever to set the trap and it can only be set once so when I accidentally dropped one K & S ; trap it triggered and it was no longer usable . Of all the traps I set up the Kill & Seal was the only one that did not catch any mice . The last time I checked the one remaining trap the bait was gone and there was something rattling around in there that looked like a mouse poop.Bottom line : The bucket trap caught the most mice ( 5 ) The Tomcat glue traps were the second most consistently effective ( 4 mice ) Close behind the Snap-E mouse traps ( 3 mice ) The Victor Kill & Seal , no mice at all .	-1
I have yet to catch a mouse with these . While the idea of not having to even get remotely close to touching a mouse is a great idea these traps are not . Made in china is a big turn off and all the extra plastic going into the landfills are a turn off too . The mice have to be very small to even fit into these traps . The mechanism on some of them is too tough to set off , the one would n't set off unless I dropped it 2 feet or more ? ? Maybe mighty mouse needs to set that one off ? : )	-1
Ca n't even get the plastic screw on top to work to open it so you can get the peanut butter on it for bait . The instructions are terrible , just on the side of the box with pictures that do n't help at all . If you ca n't get that little plastic screw piece on top open so you can remove it , then the trap is worthless . I even tried pliers , & yes , I was turning it the right way , it shows to turn it counter clock wise & after many tries I decided to try to turn it the other way too , still ca n't get that plug out to bait it . What a waste of money & it 's way over priced to begin with for something that can only be used once . I would never buy this product.I also pushed on the little red trap door that the mice are suppose to go in , well , they 'd better have been lifting weights because you have to push pretty hard to get it so they could get in & they 'd better be very tiny mice as the hole is about the size of a nickel . As far as it trapping other secretions , we all live with those in our homes whether we see it , smell it or taste it anyhow & as far as I know , unless you have a herd of mice , it does n't make you sick . If you get sick it 's because you do n't clean your home , clean your carpets annually when you have pets , wash the floors once a week . There are more germs spread by just flushing your toilet with the top up than any other item in your home puts in the air . I 'm extremely disappointed in this product .	-1
Not to reiterate what everyone else has said , we 've used the old Victor wood & spring traps for 35 years -- effective , inexpensive , reliable . These are expensive , use too much plastic , are too small for some of the rodents we catch , are difficult to use for my husband with his big hands , and are not reliable at trapping mice ! Do n't bother with this one . Good idea , but bad reality .	-1
... it kills mice at an extremely slow pace.We had an invasion of mice after a neighbor 's shed was remodeled last summer ( yikes ! Why were they all in there ? ) . Anyway , I tried out this style , the glue traps and the old-fashioned traditional traps . This came in a 2-pack and 1 eventually killed a mouse after the other style of traps and the glue traps took out what seemed to be a platoon of the things . I was pleased that I could just toss it away and not have to mess with the little mouse corpse or clean up anything.The second trap disappeared one day . Maybe our Jack Russel Terrier ran off and chewed it up ( she seems to love to consume plastic - plastic with a mouse as filling might appeal to her as well ) or maybe a really big mouse walked off with it . Either way , it sat out for months and every once in a while I 'd pick it up and find that the bait was gone and the trap did not fire off .	-1
While this product is easy to use , it is really nothing more than a glorified standard mouse trap housed in a box . A couple of times the trap was sprung but no mouse inside which made it really useless . I 've used other mouse traps that had a clear container which were more useful.Above all , I still recommend just using D-con over these types of traps .	-1
It took two of us to figure out how this rig works ; without instructions , it was a total mystery . We finally figured out that a rodent is supposed to enter the door , round a corner to get peanut butter & trip the trap . A reasonable idea , we proceeded to bait & arm the trap , putting it in a known mouse area ( I live in the country ) , along side a couple of regular traps . After 2 weeks , we 've caught several mice in regular traps but this mouse trap is still armed -- - never been tripped . Will it ever work ? Who knows , but I 'm not holding my breath . And even if it does , the price is prohibitive , in my opinion . Would I like something inexpensive & effective that would trap/kill mice such that I never had to see them ? For sure ... but this unit does n't seem to deliver the goods .	-1
I found these traps to be less than effective . And being that they are quite pricy it makes you feel that you are n't getting any sort of deal.I think the worst thing is having to check to see if they have stolen the peanut butter and finding they have . You try again and still no luck . It seems very hit or miss.If they were to redesign this product and make it 80-90 % effective then I think it might be worth the price because I do like the concept of this kind of trap over the wire ones .	-1
I was rather surprised when I received these mouse traps . They seem to be built stronger than needed for their purpose , with a fairly thick plastic housing.I do n't understand why the entrance hole for the mouse was is so small . While a mouse can squeeze through some pretty tight spaces , the size of the hole would only allow adolescent mice under a month old to get through . Mice can live for about 2 years , and this trap prevents adult mice from entering.I know I have mice at my place , but none have been caught in a month 's use of these traps . Perhaps they 're too big ? I 've had better luck with glue traps and have never had an issue with blood or parasites leaching out - is that even a real problem or something conjured up in order to sell this product ?	-1
I ordered a set of these just recently for I had heard the tell tale sounds of mice crawling around in my attic last week sometime . I have some of the old time mouse traps around , but figured I would give these a try . Personally I am not at all squeamish about picking up the old mouse traps after its nailed one of the little varmints and just releasing it into the trash or outside . But since I have always been an admitted follower as to the old pursuit of building a better mouse trap , I looked forward to trying these new space age models.I will admit I was quite impressed with the overall quality of these traps . They are at first appearance the best made , most solid looking things one could come across that is designed to be used just once and thrown away . Its not a thin molded plastic but heavy , with a solid looking door/trap , and set lever . You ca n't really see much of what is inside the unit without breaking it , but If its anything like the outside , its pretty well made inside as well . The directions on the box are as limited as they come . ( Not counting the continuing dialogue of how beneficial this new system is at saving the life of you and your whole family from fleas and germs..etc ) . The total instructions consist of four words with pictures , ... .Bait , click , set , dispose . ( And written and illustrated extremely small by the way . Had a hard time seeing the pictures clearly even with glasses . I take points off for that , just so you will know ) . The bait they suggest is a dab of peanut butter set inside a little screw top thingy , then its set the red lever and your good to go . Although Victor may feel they are on to something with this revolutionary new trapping system , the final results of my test with them are that they are thoroughly nostalgic in their missing the mark just about as often as the sentimental old favorites . It took three nights and 4 refills for me to trap my two pesky varmints . It basically was just a new twist on an old theme of their getting the bait and high tailing it out without tripping the lever . Since one can not really see inside to actually access the working parts , it can only be assumed by the track record that its workings is no more effective than the old style traps . Easier to set , definitely , solidly built and a `` pleasure '' to use , oh yes , but effective ? No more than the tried and true old slam 'em on the head design I am sorry to say.In conclusion , if you are really that set against handling a dead mouse that you are willing to spring for one of these at about $ 5.00 a shot , I guess its worth it . Although it missed as often as it hit in my trial run , it is also true that these traps are a whole lot easier to set each time than the old style ones . It just might not tend to aggravate you as much with one of these having to perform the chore over , and possibly over again . I 'm not going to make any statements or take a shot at how truly dangerous handling dead mice may really be , as all the writing on the box suggests . So I am not going to either defend it , or put it down . This much I will say however . If you 're honestly so afraid that a dead mouse is going to possibly give your family the plaque , then dispose of it outside in your trash immediately . It may be a better solution than springing for one of these generally 50 % effective , and most costly alternatives ...	-1
These traps are basically trash . They 're difficult to set , ca n't catch a mouse in an infested house , and are triggered by a bump really easily -- and ca n't be reset once triggered.My boyfriend left a milk crate of food on his kitchen floor . The mice found it . For weeks they ate and played , leaving their treats all over the kitchen . He caught something like a dozen of them using traditional traps before I got these and persuaded him to try them out . Nothing . Nothing . NO DEAD MICE for 2 weeks . He tried to move one of the traps , it tripped , and was then completely useless . He finally gave up on these , and put the regular traps out again . Lo and behold , a mouse a day ! I have to admit , my initial reaction to these was that they were kind of ridiculous , but I 'm way less germophobic than your average American , so I was prepared to give them a `` well , if you 'd rather throw away a silly amount of plastic than see a dead mouse , I guess they 're okay '' kind of review . But given that they do n't work , I do n't even have to touch on how wasteful they are in order to issue a resoundingly negative review.I mean , seriously , there were so many mice in that house that I think I might have had better luck with my bare hands than with these traps . I did n't try that , though , because that is too gross , even for me .	-1
I 've had this trap set for about a month now , and I have seen no evidence that any mouse has gone near it . And yes , we have had at least one mouse this season.In my opinion , the opening for the mouse to enter is too small , and the bait is set too far into the trap to be really attractive.In the past , I have used traps similar in style to this one : Kness Tip-Trap 109-0-001 Live-Capture Mouse Trap , which did work , and even though it leaves you with dealing with the captured mouse , it is reusable.This kill-and-seal trap , if it would ever work , is one use only , which makes it pretty expensive . But if it does n't work at all , it 's worthless .	-1
I live in the country - and therefore have to deal with mice constantly . This is a very complicated product designed to solve a problem for which there are much simpler solutions . I had trouble even understanding how the product works -but essentially you load some bait ( I used peanut butter ) into a large plastic labrinth . Only very small mice can enter the tiny entry hole . The promise is that it is a very clean way to kill the pests - but the problem is that you buy a huge trap to use once , and it will only work on tiny mice.Update two days later : to the product 's credit - it did catch a mouse - and it was very easy to dispose of . But the fact that I could only use it once seems a waste .	-1
Save your money . For me this `` better mousetrap '' was not better . Knowing that mice come into my home in the Fall , to get away from the cold , I set out a conventional wooden-based Victor M038 spring trap . Amazon sells a 4-pack of them for $ 5.84 . Less than 15 inches away , I set one of these comparatively expensive M265 traps with exactly the same bait . After two weeks , I caught zero mice with this trap and five mice with the `` old-fashioned '' trap . No matter how sanitary or convenient the Kill & Seal mouse trap is advertised to be , mine did n't catch any mice.Aside from the fact that my Kill & Seal trap did n't catch any mice the cost differential does n't make any sense even if it had worked . These traps are designed to be discarded after a single use . Victor 's wooden based spring traps , which already cost far less , can be easily emptied , washed and re-used repeatedly.Removing a dead mouse from a conventional trap may make some people cringe , but at least you know that the critter will no longer be invading your space . Our daily newspapers come in long plastic bags that are perfect for disposing of mice . I just slip the wooden trap inside one of those bags . While handling the trap through the plastic bag as if the bag were a glove , I then release the mouse into the bag , lift out the trap , tie the top of the bag and discard the bagged mouse in my outdoor garbage container . After washing the trap with anti-bacterial dish detergent , it 's clean and ready to use again .	-1
I got these because we 've seen a few mice scurrying across the floor . I put some peanut butter in the little reservoir , set the trap , and waited ... and waited ... and waited . It 's been more than a month , and neither of the two traps I set out have caught anything.Update ( 4/16/2012 ) : I checked the trap to see if I needed to replace the bait ; after all , it 's been more than a year . The only difference is the bait is gone , and the trap is filled with tiny mouse poops . I 'm throwing it out !	-1
I placed these where I 've caught numerous mice with regular traps , and had been seeing mice again , on my kitchen counter . But I never got one ! And it 's weird how you ca n't see in ; I know you 're supposed to just assume it 's set or sprung by the lever on the side , but I do n't know ... Just stick with the original .	-1
These are a very well made , easy to use mousetrap . I like their bait system , but the simple fact that you can not reuse them makes them a waste of money and materials.Let 's face a simple fact , if you have two mice , you have more than two mice , much more ! And paying $ 5 per mouse is going to get expensive very fast.And I really do n't understand why these are not reusable . It should not be that hard to have a way to open them and dispose of the mouse . Yes I know some people ca n't stand to even look at mice , but I am not one of them.Overall , a `` could have been great '' product , but I would advise against buying this one .	-1
I do n't get it . There is so much that is unappealing about this , I actually do n't know why I chose this . Essentially a waste of a cardboard box and heavy plastic devices completely useless for any purpose.Tis the season that the warmth of a home or basement draws our little friends in . However , these things have been put in basement for a month , repeatedly filled one with peanut butter and the other cheese . Neither picked up anything . However , a leftover gluetrap strip did . I actually removed anything trap related in the basement and just kept these two down there for a week , and still nothing . I know they are down there . I hear them either munching a box or scurrying around . No , they are no rats . I caught mice with glue traps several times.I ca n't play this game anymore or I will have families of mice living in these deluxe condos . So , going to get more blue traps . If for some reason one of these things ever catches a mouse I will certainly update this review . But even if they did work , I do n't like the idea that this contraption is not reusable . It is irresponsible and a waste plastic . I 'll check back later . But so far , no mice , no dice.January 23 , 2011 UPDATE : Changing the stars to 1 star . The item is completely worthless . Glue traps are the answer .	-1
The marketing premise is based on the fact that we all think mice are icky and we do n't want their germs or their decomposing bodies in our homes . Fair enough . The idea is to catch the mouse with this trap and then toss the whole kit and caboodle in the trash . My husband 's initial reaction , upon setting this up , was that throwing out a trap every time you catch a mouse is n't exactly environmentally friendly or easy on the wallet . But as this was a free sample , he agreed to give it a go.Well , now we still have the mouse . . . and the trap . . . minus the peanut butter we used as bait . There are little mouse giggles and peanut butter belches during the night.We will be going back to the traditional style mouse trap asap .	-1
Since we set the two kill and seal mouse traps we 've had an increase in kills with the old timey `` drama '' mouse traps using the same bait in other parts of the garage.I do n't think these are worth the price at all . The entrance hole is pretty tiny -- maybe it works better for house mice . I 'm not sure one of my industrial-size field mice would even bother squeezing through the hole.I suppose , if you have mouse problems inside a house with small children , that these traps are better than nothing at all .	-1
This Trap 's door is too small for an average mouse and as stated by most other reviewers on Amazon , while this product makes it easy to dispose off a trapped mouse without having to get in contact with the rodent , I personally find the trap utterly useless ; I tried the same in the garage hoping to catch something other than mice as I know for sure that mice in our area is big enough to carry this funny contraption . But it did not catch anything ! - Total waste of money.Novel concept but poorly designed and It is very expensive and totally useless product ! - Not recommended.TIP : Once you engage the trap the only way to disengage it is to give the trap a big jolt by banging on a flat surface and you can re-engage the trap and wait , wait and wait for the elusive mouse !	-1
The idea behind this trap is great but it failed to work . I kept one glue trap and this trap at same location . A mouse was trapped in glue trap in 48 hours whereas nothing was caught in this trap in two weeks ! There were no instructions in the package , just four cartoons on one side of the cover . Later I found the PDF file with instructions on Amazon web site.Automatically sealing dead mouse is good idea . The opening in this trap is very small and bigger mouse ca n't get in . The bottom line for me is that it does not work .	-1
I 've used many traps for mice and rats over the years , and the Victor kill and seal is another one that just does n't work . I know all about proper baiting and placement of traps , and I definitely have mice in my attic , but they wo n't go near the Kill and Seal . The only difference between this trap and a regular spring-loaded trap is that this one has a cover over it so you do n't have to see the dead mouse or look at it . That is the only advantage , yet you 're paying several dollars per trap more . I guess another advantage is that the mice ca n't steal the bait from the trap , but that does n't really matter if they never go for it.Unfortunately , the best mouse trap available is a glue trap . However I think they are incredibly inhumane and an awful way to kill mice and rats . If you absolutely have to get rid of mice and no other way is working , that is your best bet . If you are looking for something similar to this trap and do n't mind seeing a dead mouse , try theSnap-E Mouse Trap . If you are looking to get rid of rats and have some money to burn , the best thing I 've found is theAgri Zap RZU001 Rat Zapper Ultra ( this product will not work with rats so make sure you know that your problem is mice ) .The Victor Kill & Seal is a good idea but poor execution and way too expensive for a single use product .	-1
The two Kill & Seal traps I deployed in my home failed to kill or trap a single mice during the weeks they were in place . Meanwhile , old-fashioned , wooden traps met with great success . I live in the country , surrounded by corn and soybean fields . When harvest time arrives and the temperature begins to drop , the local field mice relocate nearby homes and barns . I 've used the made in USA , Victor M038 Easy Set Mouse Trap , 4-Pack , baited with peanut butter , with good success . In fact , after I used the Kill & Seal , exclusively , for two weeks , I placed an easy set trap within one foot of each of the Kill & Seals . Both Easy Sets killed mice within a few hours while the Kill & Seals remained unsprung and empty.Besides not liquidating mice , the Kill & Seal traps are not easy to conceal , can not be placed in tight spaces , and offer only point of entry to mice that happen upon them . Definitely not a better mouse trap . I will continue to use either the Victor Easy Sets or the regular , old-fashioned Victor wooden traps to rid my home of mice.BTW , in order to get the most out of an Easy Set , I highly recommend disregarding the instructions saying to bait the traps . Peanut butter on the yellow paddle has always done the trick for me .	-1
I really really REALLY wanted these to work ... If they had , I would pay almost any price , to not have to deal with a mouse , dead or alive ... They are easy to set , but when I put one trap side by side with a traditional wood trap , the mice preferred the wooden one ... When I left the Kill and Seal as the only choice , they snubbed it and kept on making my life miserable . Replace the Kill and Seal with a wooden trap , and SNAP ! ... got the little bugger . So ... I am still hopeful that eventually they will catch something ... Meanwhile , I buy wooden traps by the dozen , and use a long handled dust pan and broom to toss mouse and trap , which is much cheaper , although not as aesthetically pleasing ...	-1
My attic usually gets a few mice this time of year , and I was anxious to try out this trap . These are very easy to use , you just pop in the bait and then turn the knob to set the trigger . Unfortunately , when I turned the knob on the second trap , something went *crack* inside and it was broken . I treated both traps exactly the same , with no excessive cranking or force.Luckily for my house , but not for this review , it appears my efforts to close all of the tiny access points into my attic are successful , and none of the traps up there has a victim yet . I believe the remaining trap will work as advertised if any mice do find their way up there . The concept behind these traps -- no muss , no fuss disposal -- is good if you do n't want to get up close & personal with your dead rodents . But especially given the price , a 50 % failure rate right out of the box is unacceptable .	-1
This trap hits the mark on its `` building a better mousetrap '' intent : Easy no-mess baiting , effortless setting , reliable trap action , dispose of the rodent without ever seeing or touching it . Perfect . But . Now for a few of my very strong reservations . . . .1 . I do n't like mice in my house . But I detest cruel treatment of any animal , even a mouse . If you have ever used a traditional mousetrap ( Victor has made millions of them and for decades ) , you know that the trap does not always kill the mouse . Sometimes it just traps it across the neck or body while the mouse lays there wiggling . I have taken these outside and released the mouse , which flees away apparently unharmed . I have also sometimes chose to `` euthanize '' an injured trapped mouse , instantly and painlessly ( not pleasant , but necessary ) . With the M265 Kill and Seal Mouse Trap , in my opinion , there is strong possibilty that a person will neatly drop their sprung trap in the trash - with the trap containing a live mouse which will slowly starve to death inside the confined blackness of the trap . The thought makes me ill.2 . A conventional moustrap is not much more than a little bit of wire , fashioned to a small slab of pine . Can be re-used countless times . It 's tiny . If you dispose of it , the wood quickly rots away . The M265 Kill & Seal , on the other hand , is meant to be thrown away after one use and will comprise an eternal plastic block mouse tomb which will reside as-is in the city dump perpetually . I 'm not a `` green person '' . . . but this thing is a horribly wasteful way to kill a single mouse.3 . Speaking of waste , how about money ? A traditional mousetrap costs a few dimes . Look at the price on this one.I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program , for consumer evaluation . It 's an ingenious product , but I wo n't be purchasing one .	-1
Victor are the only brand of traditional mousetrap I buy , but I am not a big fan of these.In theory they are supposed to be more hygienic , safer , and disposable . In practice the plastic parts were prone to breaking , and since I accidentally set off the trap , and was unable to reset it.Plus there was insufficient documentation with the traps so I did n't know you put peanut butter or cheese on the top of the trap door , instead I just threw a piece of cheese down the trap hole . I do n't know if that was the reason , but caught no mouse in this trap while I manged to catch a mouse in a traditional mouse trap.And at $ 4 or more a trap these are hardly a bargain.Unless you are trapping around food , small children , or pets , I would stick with the tried and true traditional Victor wooden traps .	-1
Hubby has become content with using his bucket of antifreeze with a peanut butter coated spinner on top and is n't even interested in opening the box on this product . When you know you can catch 14 mice and a rat in your garage with a single bucket of antifreeze this product becomes less appealing .	-1
This product does the dirty job , encloses the mouse and makes a modern coffin for the visitor.Expensive and not green friendly . A product for the squeamish , and silly too.4.00 a pop , and can not reuse !	-1
I was unimpressed with this trap . I found it to be somewhat difficult to put food in , had a very small opening for the mouse - so much so that unless they are very curious , I question whether or not they would enter , and the plastic latch which sets / locks the trap did n't do a good job of actually locking ( I even had to throw out one of the traps after a short while b/c the latch would n't stay locked ) .Unfortunately , I currently have a problem with mice . I have 4 different types of traps : ( i ) classic spring & wire snap traps from Victor and Tomcat , ( ii ) glue pads , ( iii ) Ortho Home Defense plastic traps similar to these , and ( iv ) these ones . I find these to be the least effective and most difficult to set of the bunch . They are , however , somewhat aesthetically inoffensive relative to some of the other types of traps available , and can be placed on the counter without it looking so blatantly like you have a mouse trap there.I would not recommend these , and instead choose another product.Pros : * Decent looking plastic which is relatively inoffensive looking . * Seems like if you did catch a mouse , you would n't have to see it afterwards and it would be trapped effectively in the plastic container.Cons : * Fairly large . Also , for those who are environmentally conscious , it 's definitely more `` product '' than an old fashioned wire and spring mouse trap . * The holes for putting food in are very small . * The plastic latch to set the trap did n't do a good job of locking , and on one of the traps I eventually just could n't getit to happen after a while and I had to throw the trap out . * The mouse ca n't see / be enticed by the food b/c it 's contained in the plastic container . * Small door for the mouse to go through to get to the food ( which , however , is more than enough space for a mouse to fit through if they wanted to ) * Once food goes in , it 's really a pain to get it out , and things like peanut butter are hard to get in there .	-1
The day after I received the Victor Kill & Seal Mouse Traps , we saw a mouse in our house . I set up the mouse traps and stood back to see what would happen . You want to know what happened ? Nothing . The mouse looked interested in the trap , even crawled on top of it to check it out but did not go inside the trap to get the peanut butter . I also set up some old style snap traps to see what would happen after watching the mouse crawl on top of the new traps . The old style snap traps got the mouse . I do n't mind taking out the mouse carcasses to throw them away , but I do wear rubber gloves when I do it . I 've NEVER had a mouse make a huge mess when it was caught in an old style snap trap ( no blood or guts ... .maybe just a bit of urine or poo to have to clean up ) . I think the Victor kill and seal traps are a waste of money and resources . It seems a shame to throw away this plastic container that is going to then sit in a landfill forever . I suppose if you do n't like seeing mouse carcasses then this may be a better item for you . I could also see it would probably be handy to use in a cabin or someplace where you would n't be all the time to check the traps on a daily basis ( which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just one ) . For everyday practical purposes though , I would not purchase these traps , I will stick with the old style snap traps . So while these traps may serve a purpose , they are not for me or my home.Update to my review May 2011 : I 've had these Victor Kill and Seal Mouse Traps in my house since I received them . They have caught NOTHING ! I checked the traps on a regular basis and recently found the peanut butter totally cleaned out of one of the traps but the trap never went off . If you would like to provide a nice comfortable home for a mouse , feel free to buy these traps because they are a complete waste of money . I put out some more of the old snap traps and caught my mouse overnight ! If I could give these traps a negative star , I would . I have now thrown mine in the garbage because that is all they are ... .GARBAGE ! I 'll be sticking with my snap traps from now on . They have never let me down .	-1
One room with hardwood floors where I kept a rescue cat and her kittens became infested with fleas . Treated the mother and kittens with Advantage II when they were weaned , and removed them from the room . The boxes and bedding I had in there for them was thrown out . There is nothing on the floor , no curtains , no furniture , no rug , just an empty room . Seems like that would be easy to rid of fleas , right ? I vacuumed then sprayed every square inch of the floor , including window sills and into the baseboards . Some fleas died but the next day there were still live fleas jumping around . Vacuumed every other day . Mixed Suspend with Archer which is supposed to keep the flea eggs and larvae from hatching . Still had fleas live through it and hatch out . Sprayed a third time , this time with 3x the amount specified of both chemicals mixed with water . It has been almost a month and that room still has fleas ! That room has been completely locked up and empty other than my vacuuming and spraying episodes . This is just pointless and a waste of money , and made my stomach upset for days after spraying it despite using proper ventilation , and wearing rain boots and rubber gloves . *UPDATE : If you are reading this , you are looking for a solution to your indoor flea infestation . I want to share what I finally found that did work ! I mixed three chemicals together at the recommended levels with water:1 ) Talstar Pro insecticide ( active ingredient : 7.9 % Bifenthrin ) 2 ) Dominion insecticide ( active ingredient : 21.4 % Imidacloprid ) 3 ) Nyguard IGR ( active ingredient : Pyriproxyfen ) First let me warn that Talstar is not recommended for broadcast spray indoors , however I was willing to try anything that might work . Talstar is a very strong insecticide . Dominion contains the same chemical used in Advantage topical flea treatment ( do NOT use Dominion on pets though ! ) . Nyguard stops eggs and larvae from hatching.To mix and spray these chemicals , you must wear a respirator mask and I recommend wearing long pants tucked into rubber rain boots , long sleeves , goggles , and elbow length chemical-resistant gloves . You should crack the windows to ventilate and keep pets and people out of the treated room . After the first spray with this mix , nearly all fleas were DEAD that day ! A week later , only a few flea eggs had managed to survive and hatch , and the second spray eliminated them . No return of fleas ! Just for good measure , I sprayed a third time ( all 3 spraying were 1 week apart ) , and I left the room with the residue on the floor for several weeks after the last spray . Just be safe I mopped the floors with pinesol twice to remove any trace of the chemicals before allowing any pets to enter the room . This long process may be overly cautious but I did n't want any possibility of a reinfestation by mopping too soon , and I would n't take a chance of poisoning to my pets !	-1
It seemed good , I charged the battery , did the simple assembly , and the next day advanced to the front yard with what seems a very powerful unit . It cut like a pro , but I noticed it was advancing line automatically every time it touched anything but grass . Within two minutes it had spilled out all the line on the spool , with little four inch plastic line pieces everywhere . The spool ran out in under two minutes ! I want you to understand that it was a factory refreshed unit , but obviously they did not fix the original problem . I wrote Black and Decker and they are sending a `` clutch spring '' . It is not nice to buy things that are not working on delivery . Quality control should be better than this ! Right now , I am unhappy.I will try to stop back later if it ever works right .	-1
I got this for my husband to replace our aging gas trimmer . We had recently gotten a Black & Decker CM1936 19-Inch 36-Volt Cordless Electric Lawn Mower which he loves . Thinking this would be as good as that product , we were happy to continue with our effort to `` go green . '' Well , after just a couple of uses , it 's been sitting in the garage while the old but reliable gas trimmer has gotten a second lease on life.There are a number of reviewers who have already gone into detail on the issues with this trimmer , so here is a summary per my husband : Positives:1 ) Battery-powered is `` green '' technology and avoids the gas fumes.2 ) The trimmer is very powerful and easily handles tough areas.Negatives:1 ) The battery has a very short life . We have a small yard and my husband was barely able to finish it with this trimmer . With a bigger yard , it would n't be possible to get done on one charge . The charging time is long , so forget about finishing in one day if you fall into this category ( it takes about 9 to 10 hours to recharge ) .2 ) The string runs out in no time . My husband noticed it breaking off in small chunks ( fortunately he was wearing jeans unlike a previous reviewer that got bloodied from string chunks hitting his ankles ) .3 ) The mechanism for running the unit was difficult to hold down comfortably.All in all the idea behind this trimmer is good , but the execution lags ( unlike their lawnmower ) . Hopefully Black & Decker will go back to the drawing board and come out with an improved model that addresses these issues .	-1
I really wanted this product to work because I hate gasoline powered lawn mowers . But sadly , the unit I received just did n't have what it takes to mow St. Augustine grass . It just bogged down even when cutting half a strip of grass . I finally raised the lawn mower cutting height to the point it would n't bog down and it just skimmed over the top of the grass spewing grass out the sides of the lawn mower making a big mess . Obviously I charged the battery a full day before I even attempted to mow the grass . I followed all the instructions to the letter . I was so disappointed I actually shipped it back to Amazon for a refund.I am a major purchaser on Amazon and this is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon in the entire five or more years I have been buying from Amazon . I am an Amazon Vine member . I read so many reviews on battery powered lawn mowers before I made this purchase because I was so worried it would be underpowered . And my concerns were validated . I do n't understand why my lawn mower did n't perform . Maybe the battery was weak or would n't charge properly , but it certainly seemed ok . I 'm sure I 'll get a lot of rebuttal comments because I gave this lawn mower a low rating . But I will state up front that I have credentials and I am no dummy.So I broke down and purchased a gasoline powered lawn mower here on Amazon for about the same price and naturally it works great . But now I 'm stuck going to the gas station to buy gasoline and storing it in my garage again .	-1
As I stated in the title this is my first review , but a longtime Amazon Prime whom buys everything online.Upon initially receiving this product I was blown away by the quality of the sprayer . My other two sprayers are the box store roundup ( ok ) and the Chaplin 1 gallon . The quality difference what instantly noticeable . I loaded up glypsophate ( aka roundup ) and prepared to clear 300 ft of weeds on my swell.Five minutes in the unit falls apart . Half spilling on the lawn , the rest on me . Upon taking a hiatus to remove the chemical of my clothes and self I noticed that the connection between the handpump and the internal pump valve are connected by two plastic screws in between two pieces of plastic . I forgot to add that I wasted 30 minutes looking for the two screws amongst the weed.Disappointing since the unit as such promise , but a few corners cut by the manufacturer ruin what could 've been a great device . I will be returning later today and searching for a different option .	-1
These I put them last year and they were still present in my garden . Just picked them and threw them . Not sure what the contents are , and even if it is a slow release these are supposed to make the tomato plants healthier . Did not see anything ... .not buying them anymore .	-1
Sent it back right after I got it . The support rail to keep it from tipping back and over is a flimsy steel rod . I can tell this thing will not be very stable when filled with fertilizer . Cheaply made , decided to spend the money on a quality spreader.I bought this because I have a 20 year old Scott spreader that needs replacement , the old one was built way better .	-1
I am very bummed out to be writing this review , but I 'd be doing the public a disservice not to . I really wanted to love this product and use it and be happy with it , but it just was n't meant to be.Setup/assembly was a breeze . It fired up immediately and I started mowing away on my small front lawn . My grass at the time was about 5 inches high , so I had to start with a higher blade setting and go lower as time went on . It went well for about eight minutes , cutting and mulching like a pro . And then it just ... died . I tried changing different outlets , different extension cords , but no dice . Every time I 'd try to turn on the mower , it would trip my circuit breaker ( 15 or 20A on all outlets tried ) . I stopped trying when , at one point , I plugged in the extension cord which was already plugged into the mower , and sparks shot out of my outlet.OK , so it 's a defected product . I decided to give the company a chance to remedy this situation before going back to Amazon . Unfortunately , I could n't reach Greenworks to save my life . I stayed on their customer support line in the queue for 20-30 minutes each time , waiting fruitlessly . I tried right at 9am , right at 4:55 PM , and in between . I emailed their customer support address and got no response , either . Not even an email confirmation saying & # 34 ; thanks for reaching us , we 'll get back to you in 24-48 hours ) . So , with a defective product in hand and no customer service to remedy the situation whatsoever , I am returning this lemon to Amazon . I do n't want a replacement of a product that the company wo n't bother to support ! Again , I 'm not happy to be writing this review . I see so many 5 star reviews on here of extremely happy users . But , I 'm just not one of them . Too bad . What will I buy instead ?	-1
I bought this product because i remember how nice push mowers are using a Scots mower growing up . This mower was easy to assemble and cuts well . But when cutting it tends to throw the clippings up rather then back into the catcher . This makes the clippings pile up on top of the blades and jams up the mower if you dont stop and clear out the built up cuttings ever min . I would not recommend anyone buying this mower	-1
I was really hoping this would work ! We have a springtime invasion of very tiny black ants . They are particularly attracted to the kitchen sink , probably as a source of water.When they showed up this spring I immediately put out some diatomaceous earth . It did n't stop them so I ordered this Terro product . It 's supposed to be fairly safe to use but the instructions said to wear gloves when applying . I did n't own appropriate gloves so I had to buy some . Then I sprinkled the bait around the foundation of the house . It was barely enough.It 's supposed to start working in a few days and at first I thought it might be doing something because there seemed to be a decrease in numbers of ants . However , three weeks later we still have ants ! Every morning I see a bunch of them in the kitchen sink and on the backsplash , plus a few near the dog 's dish and a couple in the bathroom . Today I saw hundreds in the outdoor garbage can even though it stands only a foot from the wall where I applied the bait.This product is borate-based so it is a derivative of boric acid . Boric acid is considered safer than many pesticides , although it still carries risks . According to Wikipedia , it is `` poisonous if taken internally or inhaled in large quantities . '' In this ant bait , the borate appears to be coated with something so it is not as likely to be inhaled as plain boric acid powder is . I assume the coating is supposed to be tasty to ants . Perhaps our ants are picky eaters because they are still alive .	-1
I put this `` bait '' around the perimeter of my house about a month ago . The packaging is very convenient and has a hinged cap for the top portion as seen in the illustration and the bottom portion of the cap has holes . Turning the plastic container upside down and squeezing the sides causes the granules to escape through the cap holes . The granules are teeny tiny and seem to be only slightly larger than dust particles . After applying the granules I could no longer see them in the mulch , pine straw and other vegetation that encircles the perimeter of my house . One of the other reviewers placed some of this product on a sheet of paper to observe any insect activity . That is a great idea and makes for a more accurate analysis of the product but unfortunately I did not think of doing that . As a result I can only report on what I see and what I see is a whole bunch of live ants . There was a time when I saw what I had hoped was an ant funeral procession which I was willing to attribute to Terro Ant Bait consumption but it turned out to be just a parade to and from an ant food source.I have no evidence to support an ant population decrease and therefore have no choice but to rate this one star . I have several varieties of ants but they all seem to be thriving despite the generous supply of Terro Ant Bait which I provided for them .	-1
I put this around the perimeter of our home , per the instructions , and so far so good - no bugs close to the house ( but then before the application , I did n't have any either ) .I DO have some active ant hills in the yard ( in the grass ) , and I put this generously on those , and waited a week . Today I checked , and some of the ants are still there , active and happy . I 'm NOT . I 'd rather use a liquid that I can pour on these ant hills and kill all those nasty bugs , as that seams to work better than dry granules , bait , or whatever this is all suppose to be . I wo n't be purchasing more of this .	-1
I applied this several times in increasing amounts to see just how much it would take to make an impact . In most cases the answer was `` a lot '' . In small amounts I 'd see ants merrily walking through it ignoring it . Of a dozen problems locations I tried , two seem to have had an impact on the colony , and that was when I encircled them completely using lots with no escape . One of the biggest failures was my mailbox which gets swarmed when it rains . I surrounded the post , put some on post ledges , and some in the back of the mailbox where they were entering ; they just ant-laughed at me . I did n't use at the indoor areas where ants were entering because of pets/children.Shockingly perhaps , I have the better ant control results with the plastic bait traps combined with spraying active areas .	-1
I had carpenter ants in a wall I took out during a remodel . I sprayed the inside of the wall with Real Kill and raid before we insulated and dry walled . The room is 5 feet above a concrete cistern and I found where the ants were getting in and calked the opening . Two nights later I saw carpenter ants all over the wall and they had chewed a big hole in the calk and began to re-enter the same wall ! I could n't believe it . I tried Amdro with little results , it has worked in the past after about 6 months of diligent weekly applications but it took forever to get rid of them and they obviously returned . I tried Terro placing it in the line of Carpenter ants at night when they are on the move . Two days later I no longer saw them anywhere on the building . I will re-apply again to be sure but it sure seems to have done the trick . If they come back I will report back but so far so good ! Update , after a week the carpenter ants returned . I re applied this product but it did nothing but make them move for a short while . I tried seven dust around the outside where the trails were at night and that really worked i even found dead ants .	-1
Up Date July 19 2011 I have used Cyclone 0.80 Inch line In It and It works great but the line breaks too easy In heavy weeds . I still think this weed trimmer was made for Jonesy fluoride-heads Its like a Corvette It has No useful purpose other than amusement and the 5.5 amp motor Is like a Corvette Engine because of that It turned out to be a good weed trimmer . I got most of My lawn done and made It to My small Swimming pool but the Swimming pool has stared to dry rot , I used the Black & Decker Grass Hog 1000 last year but the plastic gear melted before I could get much of anything done.First this weed trimmer or should I say In you Jonesy fluoride-head who are so pathetic that rocky mountain spotted fever and lyme disease and taking that poison cyprofloxin Is Not a problem for you In your case grass trimmer Is Not for you because the motor has a few extra pounds but for You that needs a real weed trimmer and do Not want to drop dead In Oklahoma humidity trying to start a gas powered weed trimmer , I succeeded at mounting metal blades to It also getting It to use 0.130 Inch Cyclone line . Silly Me I did Nor realize that the center screw was hitting the metal shaft throwing off the balance but the cap kept coming off I think drilling a hole In the cap and putting a wire through the eyelets will hold the cap on . Its more powerful than the discontinued Troy Bilt TB50 but Not as powerful as Black & Decker Grasshog 1000 but It does Not have a plastic gear that melts even though the motor bogs down a little bit with the heavy line , I did Not smell the motor getting hot as with the TB50 I do Not think It Is powerful enough to run the aluminium blades without bogging down but will run the plastic blades with the metal edge just fine buy the kit and mount It to the cap make sure Its well In the center or Its like holding a paint shaker It shook so hard It kept coming unplugged and unfortunately there are No marks where to put the screws In or Instructions how to mount the metal blades as there should be . Actually It does better with the 0.065 Inch line than 0.130 line It slows down too much with the heaver line so I want to try Cyclone 0.080 line and see how well It works . This year I hope to actually exceed Into getting Into My back yard where My small Swimming pool Is which I have Not been able to do for years because the lawn equipment kept breaking .	-1
Thank goodness for Amazon Prime because it totally , completely just stopped working the 2nd time I used it . Beware , I am very disappointed , I had hopes of years use with it . I had to come back to alter the rating because the 1st time was great . Urgh !	-1
I live in New England was bought this for a christmas gift . Each snow fall I used this with I was not very happy . I could shovel faster than this thing works ( with more effort granted ) . The ability to angle the snow in a particular direction was just above worthless . Half the snow you are angling always ends up going right in front of you . The problem with this , is that this is only rated for 6 inches of snow ( though I have used it up to a foot ) but as you push the snow you inevitably end up putting the snow right back in front of you adding inches to the snow you are trying to move.I like the idea of electric snow blowers and think it would be a great use for me but without the ability to direct the snow properly this becomes alot more work than necessary in heavy snow . Keep the snow less than 6 inches and you wont have too much of a problem.I do not recommend this product and would never buy this tool for myself . I will be buying the greenworks 12 amp snow thrower to replace this one .	-1
UPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR : Despite protecting the unit from the elements when not in use , it is severely rusted . Several nuts and bolts have fallen out , most of those remaining are rusted . The unit has been used in a driveway without salt - so that is not the cause.In short , it seems as though this is built as a disposable snow thrower , rather than something to use for years . I no longer believe this is a good unit and instead consider it a poor choice.It 's a good urban/suburban unit for clearing smaller areas ( eg , suburban Boston area two-car driveway ) . Handled properly it can handle significant snowfall ( 6-8 '' ) , including the wet ( but not frozen ) stuff at the bottom of the driveway.The most difficult part is the first run through fresh snow . Once that first run is completed , the remaining work can be done taking a bit off at a time if necessary . ( I typically take 1/2 width for deeper snow , only 2-4 '' slices for wet stuff at the bottom of the driveway.Overall it is a bit faster and MUCH less strain on the body , especially the back.Two problems:1 . One nut for the chute fell off in the first 10 minutes of use . I 'm pretty sure it was n't loose as I tightened both immediately before use.2 . Contrary to the image used , the chute can not go flat . Instead the snow is forced to fly up into the air , often onto neighbor 's property . This flies in the face of designing a good urban/suburban unit for use in tight quarters.Despite those two annoyances , it 's a good unit .	-1
Fiskar is known for its sharp tools and this product appears sturdy . However while using the de-weeder the first time , this device could not remove deeper weeds . Had to go at it multiple times . First the device kept slipping off the weed stem then when it did grip the stem , I pulled for dear life and heard the shaft crack and loosen . Needless to say that it is a good idea , but just did not work for me . I will get the garden weasel .	-1
This thing is a waste of moeny and time . I never figured out how to use this thing . Do n't bother with this one .	-1
I bought this item 3 months ago trying to solve my mouse problem . long story short it did not work.Long story , I live in a 1550sq ft ranch style house . When we first moved in we had a small mouse problem so i started traping them . I saw this item hopeing it will save me time checking the traps and re setting them . I plugged the product into the inside kitchen wall which is about dead center on my house . We thought it was taking care of the mouse problem until last week . We found a baby mouse in the printers paper tray ! This was about 15 ' from the unit . Later that day we heard chewing in the attic and i found a nest above the living room , which is next to the kitchen , about 15 feet from the product . We went back to using good old snap traps and i cought 2 adults and 1 baby , also some kind of small mole . We havent had any insects but i also spray outside monthly . I really did believe in this product but i guess it was just luck that the mouse went away for 2 months when i first installed it.My advice , stick to the snap traps or a hotel .	-1
I was a little unsure of my getting this item because it seems to me something like a hawker at the state fair selling all those gadgets or & # 34 ; but if you order now we 'll include another one one free for just the shipping & handling ; & # 34 ; ( which is equal to the actual price of the gadget to begin with ) .Well , after two weeks with it plugged in the attic , we still had rats having a great time every morning about 3AM ! SO , I can not recommend this item because it does n't do the job it says it will do . We have caught 5 rats in traps and 1 mouse on a glueboard . And , they did n't cost me $ 15 .	-1
I feed my birds a mixture of black oil sunflower seeds , safflower , and sunflower hearts . I usually buy my seeds in bulk at the local pet store , then mix up my concoction at home . Recently , while at a local home improvement store , I came across Wagner 's . I knew I was out at home , the price was reasonable , so I thought I would try it.Last night we had a snow storm so this morning I wanted to make sure my birds were fed , so I went out to the garage to mix up my bird food . Upon opening the sunflower seeds I was immediately concerned with the amount of debris in the bag . As I began to pour it my mixing tin , it only got worse . I tried picking out all the garbage , but it was too much . Twigs , leaves and unidentifiable dried up brown things galore ! I am used to some debris in bird food , but this was ridiculous - crazy excessive . Once I got all my food mixed up , it kept getting stuck and clogged in the feeders as I was filling them . I kept having to stop , remove the obstruction , then continue to fill the feeders.I am not sure what my normal brand is , I wish I knew so I could tell everyone to purchase that product . I hope my birds forgive me for the extra garbage in their food . I will not be purchasing this product again . I will gladly pay the extra cost at the pet store for clean sunflower seeds.Cherise Everhard , February 2013	-1
Unfortunately i got this in the mail and the bag for some reason had busted open but i still decided to give a try since it made my whole house a mess and i had to pick it up anyway.I left the seed out and not a single bird not even a squirrel came near it ! So unless the birds and squirrels in my neighborhood are very particular this Wagner 's deluxe wild bird food was untouched for nearly 2 whole weeks . I would definitely not buy this again or recommend it .	-1
I ordered two and neither will hold air ! Waste of time and effort trying to get replaced . Sorry I could n't give it a one star review .	-1
The .7Kg / 25 oz Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac , designed and engineered in Germany and made in Hungary , is packaged as four pieces which quickly snap together . The tank snaps onto the handle section which contains the motor works and rechargeable lithium ion battery , then the vacuum neck snaps into the handle section , locking the tank into place . Lastly , the blade assembly snaps into the vacuum neck . Fully assembled , the device stands 14 '' / 356 mm tall , 4.75 '' / 121 mm deep , and 3.5 '' / 89 mm wide at the base and 11 '' / 280 mm wide at the wiper blade.According to the instructions on the box , all that 's required is to spray the surface with cleaning solution then vac-wipe . On relatively clean mirrors in the bathroom the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac worked well enough . When I tried this approach on dirty exterior windows and wound up with a streaky mess . I went to the product website for additional information and found the online instructions require a three step process . Spray the surface with detergent , clean the surface with a microfiber cloth , then vacuum the liquid away . Once done , empty the tank and recharge the battery for next time.Between the small tank and the need to scrub the windows first , it 's easier to just use a standardwindow washing squeegee.Being promoted as being able to clean windows , mirrors , condensation , showers , car windows , spills , and auto bodies , I grabbed the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac to clean up a significant spill in our bar . The Karcher wet vac started sucking up the liquid , then would spit it out the side venting and shut down . As a device to clean up spills , the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac fails to deliver , and made a bigger mess on my cabinets.I am so disgusted by the ineffectiveness and uselessness of the Karcher Cordless window and flat surface wet vac I wish I could return it , or better yet destroy it with a sledge hammer . I would suggest there is a special need for assistance , I would recommendPROS : Clean up to 45 windows per chargeSimple to assembleCan be returned for a full refundCONS : Ineffective and excessive tool	-1
A common method of cleaning glass and sometimes other flat surfaces is to wet them with a cleaning solution and squeegee the liquid off . This Karcher cordless wet vac handles the last part ok , but it 's much more complex to deal with than a simple squeegee and towel . But , more to the point , simply spraying on the cleaner is rarely sufficient - you need to wipe or scrub to get adhered grime off . Many squeegees have a mesh-covered foam side used for that purpose , or there 's always the classic towel.I found that the Karcher vac did remove cleaner from the glass , but unless the glass was merely dusty , it remained dirty . I could spray and then wipe , then use the Karcher to remove residual moisture , but it seemed like an awful lot of bother for such a simple task . You would have to keep the vac charged , then when done disassemble it and clean out the storage tank . While this is easily done , it 's a fairly large appliance that could be difficult to store compactly . I also noticed that the power supply was the old , inefficient transformer type rather than a newer switching supply , and was not universal voltage.Lastly , the squeegee head supplied is more than 11 inches wide - too wide for many of the divided-light windows in my house . An optional 6 inch head is available which I think would be more versatile.I ca n't recommend the Karcher Wet Vac . It does n't significantly improve on traditional non-motorized methods and is not versatile enough to pay its way .	-1
This window vac , in some ways is good ; but I question its use on flat services . If you hold the vac parallel and you have fluid in the bottom container that it has vacuumed up it will leak out unless the fluid container is held lower than the main body of the vac.We have tilt in windows and there is no way we could use this product holding it straight up when we clean an upper window that is tilting in . We would have to have the vac upside down- using the squeegee pulling up - the fluid container would be higher than the squeegee and out comes the fluid . So for that it is useless.Then I went to clean a storm door that has a full length glass . The vac itself is taller than the bottom of the window and it was impossible to clean with the squeegee the bottom 6 inches or so - the rubber squeegee just did n't want to suck clean , because I had to hold it out almost parallel to the glass - so for most things we have to hand clean - with the old fashioned cloth rag at least partly on most things we are trying to clean.So in total this gadget can not complete its cleaning mission .	-1
Before I had a black and decker string trimmer . It worked fine but I thought it should have lasted longer than it did . So I purposely bought a weed eater . That was a big mistake . This weed eater is no good at all . Worthless junk . The string will not feed , after many attemps to make it work , I had to give up . It is junk . I can not recommend it .	-1
First the line wo n't feed . Then the line wo n't stop feeding . Then the excess line wraps around the hub . Then the weeds wrapped around the hub . Then the electric motor overheated . And so ended the first ( and last ) half hour of using this cheap piece of garbage .	-1
Given the rave reviews I decided to give these a chance although with some hesitation due to the relatively low price and inability to try them on before buying . Well , like the old adage , you get what you pay for.First , these are huge . If you happen to be a smaller sized woman then be prepared to simply swim in these things . They tend to be rather sturdy so will not easily conform to the shape of your hand or wrist whatsoever . To give a perspective , my pinky finger literally only goes half way up ... the rest just wrinkles and bends backwards . As for dimensions around , I could fit BOTH my wrists into one single glove . Far too large for the average woman.Additionally , as others have pointed out , these are not truly rose gloves and will not provide the type of intensive protection most have come to expect.Given the price , they are still a decent value esp if the size fits . I did decide to keep them and use just for general labor , digging and non-precise labor as they are well built and sturdy .	-1
The big deal about this grill is its portability . But look at the shipping weight in the product details section : 71 pounds . Subtract some for the box and foam packing material , and it 's still pretty close to 70 pounds . Now , realize that it has two 30-quart coolers stowed on the bottom , and add in the weight of the ice , drinks , and meat you 'll put in those coolers . Bottom line : this thing is HEAVY and will likely take 2 people to handle and maneuver.Quality control on mine was a bit lacking : one of the coolers had its lid zipper sown improperly , leaving a 3-inch opening in the front when the zipper is closed . Also , the latch that is supposed to hold down the grill 's lid in transit is completely ineffectual.The plastic side shelves do not fold down , as you might expect , but are separate pieces , designed to be pushed into place when you want to use the grill and pulled out and ( I presume ) nested together and placed inside the grill itself for transport . Very kludgy . ( The instruction manual does not say a word about how to handle the shelves while transporting the grill . ) There are two `` leveling feet '' on the front legs of the grill ; the back legs rest on wheels . Leveling feet are a great idea for a portable grill ; however , these each provide only one-quarter of an inch of adjustment ! 1/4 '' ! Whoever designed this thing must be used to some mighty smooth picnic grounds.The transport handle does NOT lock in the up position , meaning you are limited to dragging the grill behind you ; if you try to push it , the handle collapses . This grill is wider than most doorways , including the one from my sun room to the back yard , so two people are required to move it sideways through the door . The gas regulator is easy to remove and install , but there is no place to stow it for transport . If you are supposed to also stow it inside the grill , I would expect it would damage the finish of the lid and/or grate.I should also mention that all that happens to make this grill ready for transport is that you push down the sides so that the bottom of the grill rests on top of the coolers . It 's not all that compact , so you must have an SUV or pickup truck to transport this grill to any remote location.We still have snow on the ground so I have n't actually cooked anything on the grill yet . This review just covers build quality , which is n't up to what I would expect at this price . When I think what I could get for just a little more money : Char Broil M2 Four-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill , with Sideburner -- sure , that one does n't have the promise of portability , but how often will I really want to lug this one around ? And after reading another review comments about how messy this one gets , I do n't know if I really want to lug this one around.Some statistics without comment : Of the 6 5-star reviews on this page , 4 were written by people who have never reviewed anything else , and the other 2 people seem to specialize in reviewing Char-Broil products . None of those reviews have a statement from Amazon that the person owns the product ; the reviews that do have such a statement give it 4 stars or less .	-1
I have been using this stuff for years , and have always had marvelous results . However , first I tried the Bonide for lawns since it was so very highly recommended by the garden store . But , nothing happened ( spent $ 20 on it too ) . They just wilted a bit , then came back with a vengeance . Then , I bought this Spectricide since I 'd always had such a wonderful result with it . Well , nothing ! It 's always , always done the job but even on the regular dandelion plants , this stuff made them look like I actually watered them ! They had even multiplied to the point where it was starting to choke the grass around it . I had the added problem of a newly seeded lawn so I had to be careful with what I used.So , I just gave in and called Scott 's professional lawn service to take care of the weeds . In the technician 's words , our yard looked & # 34 ; rough & # 34 ; from all the weeds . He was here over an hour trying to get them all taken care of - 3 weeks after I had sprayed this Spectricide . Guess what ? After less than 24 hours , all of the weeds are now wilting and fading into the sunset . So , that said , I am wondering if they 're watering this stuff down to get the price they need for it or what . After all these years to not have it work when it had for so long , it just leaves me wondering . Guess I 'll be paying for a lawn service from now on !	-1
I have long favored Spectracide products over the other popular brands available because I always found them to be more reliable . This product let me down , big . I mixed it according to the directions and used it in a back yard overrun with wild violets , oxalis , and ( shudder ) shotweed ... twice . The first time , the weeds appeared to notice but , with the exception of the oxalis , everything else bounced back after about 10 days . That 's when I made the second application , using a better sprayer than I had used the first time . I also increased the amount I used slightly . Three days later , it appears the weeds have learned to like it . Does this stuff have an expiration date ?	-1
Some sunshine at last , and I am able to try out the new umbrella . It works ; it looks nice ; and it seems well made . It arrived without the finial ; however , once I notified Ace Evert and forwarded the Amazon delivery notice , Mark Spiegel sent me a replacement.I live in a very windy place and am finding that even light wind gusts affect the stability of my patio table when the umbrella is up . I wish I had a square umbrella stand , instead of the round one I have presently , and I may even try screwing the legs of the table to the deck . But I 'm beginning to think the best thing to do is to lower it in windy conditions and even on calm days when I 'm not sitting at the table , in order to hang onto things in the event of a sudden gust.Update Aug 2012 . In the process of lowering it , due to an approaching storm , that notorious pin fell out , the umbrella collapsed , and the bottle of red wine which I 'd just opened , was swept onto the deck . My positive feelings for the product quickly drained away , along with the wine .	-1
My yard is overrun with snails and slugs . At night , after a rain , I can find as many as 20 snails crawling across the sidewalk . All of my plants are being eaten by these invaders so I gave this product a try . It seems like I have seen a slight reduction in the numbers of the slimy creatures , but there are still so many that I bought a much larger container of a different brand . This product just did n't do enough to control the population .	-1
I have used Sluggo snail and slug killer and some other brand from Home Depot . I found that this one did n't seem to last as long as the others once it got wet . I also did n't like the fact that the product seemed to break down in the package and create a dust that poofed out as you shook the bottle around to dispense it . I never noticed that with the other brands . I 'm pretty sure that all three work in the same way so I think I will be sticking with one of the others . How is it going to work if it is gone before they can get to it ?	-1
I feel bad leaving a bad review , but nevertheless , this machine did not work well for me.I put it all together , no leaks , all together properly , but it was no more than a lazy trickle . My finger over the top of the hose did better and was twice as powerful . I used the soap dispenser and it worked okay , but nothing fancy about it . Then I took to power-washing ( and I hate to even use that term here ) . I looked for kinks in the hose ... I turned the water all the way up , checked to see if I had the machine turned on , checked to see if I had it plugged in ... maybe I got a lemon , I do n't know , but this machine would n't even wash the dirt off the bottom of my shoe ( yes , I tried that too ) . I left it out so my husband could try it when he got home from work ... like maybe I missed something that he could see and get it to work better . Nope , sorry folks , it did n't work for me . I was n't expecting a lot , because it is small , but honestly , my hose can do better on its own . Where 's the pressure ? Again , maybe I got a lemon , but I 'm returning it , not exchanging it , and buying a professional one . I can always turn it down if it 's too powerful ... but ca n't turn this one up !	-1
Even though the grill arrived nested in two other boxes , it was damaged . The top cover was dented in 3 places with small chips of orange paint all over the inside the box .	-1
However the yellow jackets and ants loved it . Even with the water well filled the yellow jackets were constantly trying to get inside . ( Last summer they were AWFUL ! ) It sticks to the glass OK . The Hummers preferred the & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; feeder and avoided this one completely .	-1
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development , metabolism , reproductive activity and many more ( E.g. , see Science Daily `` Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally '' , January 22 , 2013 , or Google for a very long list of other articles . The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and does n't seem to be disputed . ) I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not . I received a reply from Carol that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders . She also said they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder . Let 's encourage them to change that stance ! I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do . Even if one is n't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds , consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations . Furthermore , consider the food chain and the general fact that we 're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it . This feeder has many _great_ properties , but it 's not the only feeder with them ; personally I will buy alternatives until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs . I would love to see them do so.There are many hummingbird feeders out there . Aspects is the primary manufacturer using BPA that I am aware of . If you like this feeder , consider alternatives from other brands .	-1
I purchased this product for my house plants , greenhouse , and cuttings containers . To tell the truth , I saw no difference in the amount of fungus gnats whatsoever . But the reason I 'm specifically displeased with it , is that it seemed to inhibit root formation on my cuttings . The container ( plastic tote ) that was untreated had a lot of fungus gnats as usual , but the cuttings quickly grew roots just as I expected them to . In the two containers that were treated with gnatrol , few of the cuttings survived at all , but the ones that did were painfully slow to form roots and even after rooting most of them eventually succumbed due to unidentifiable factors . The only difference in play was the addition of this product , so that is where I 'm placing blame.Did n't help a bit , and possibly caused harm ... not to mention a little pricey . I 'm not going to be a return customer for this item .	-1
I think I 've tried everything now to get rid of fungus gnats . This stuff did n't do much if anything . The yellow stickies caught bunches but barely slowed them . I let the plants dry until nearly dead , I tried teas , spices , soaps , Neem , and everything else I found or heard about . I finally got rid of them by scraping off the top 1 '' layer of soil and replacing it with sand .	-1
Per the Amazon description : '' Product DescriptionSteven Raichlen Best of Barbecue Dual Handle Large Grill Brush is styled with forged stainless steel and ergonomic Pakkawood handle . A wide grill brush doubles cleaning efficiency . The long handle gives extra reach for getting across the grill and staying out of the heat . An additional handle on the back of the grill brush head provides for two-handed leverage for putting some shoulder into the scouring a hot grill . Brush head is 4-inch square . with brass bristles . Overall length is 19-1/2-inches . `` This brush , while seemingly heavy-duty and nice , is NOT what the description says - it has STAINLESS STEEL BRISTLES , NOT BRASS ! Weber , the maker of my Summit gas grill , says NOT to use stainless steel bristles on the stainless steel grates , as they will scratch . I bought this brush specifically because it SAID `` brass bristles '' and that the bristle head was replaceable . Guess I 'll have to look for a brass-bristled replacement head now , but it irks me that the head that came with it is useless to me ! AND not what the description says it is ! Grrrrrrr .	-1
There is no way that this net fits a 9 ' umbrella . The net pictured here must be a 5 ' or6 ' umbrella . On my 9 ' umbrella , the net sits right on the edge . I found the net very difficult to place . It is basically a tube and you have to figure out how to maneuver it unto the umbrella . I started with the draw string almost closed and them placed it on the closed umbrella . As a slowly opened the umbrella , I loosed the draw string . Finally , as the net came to the rim of the umbrella , the net base reached the floor.As soon as I placed the net I thought to myself , this thing is going back ! However , once inside the net , I kinda liked it . There are no visible seems ( except for the zipper ) and that makes the net very transparent . The base is flimsy and I would n't even bother trying to fill it with water . I found that since the net barely hangs on the edge of the umbrella , I placed a few stitches ( needle & thread ) at each point on my umbrella . This kept the net from slipping off . Also , no one has addressed how on Earth to close the umbrella with the net on . I close my umbrella nightly . Once again I found that the stitches held the netting in place when the umbrella is closed . I simply gather up the excess netting and place it on the patio table.The net does serve it 's purpose . It keeps bugs out . But it is way to cumbersome and difficult to set up . So I give it a 3 out of a 10.Update ... . I have been using this net for a few weeks now . I finally tried to fill the base with water . Surprise ! It held water and actually made this a pretty nice `` screen house '' . I also found a way to hold the net up ( with out water in base ) at the points of the umbrella when not using the net . I am using metal shower hooks at each point . I gather up the net at each point and close the hook on the gathers . It looks really nice ! And I can easily close my umbrella when the net is gathered up . I am now giving this net a 5 out of 10 . Hope it lasts the summer and into next year .	-1
I bought these to pull pork after being smoked . Using these was not as easy as just using a pair of forks . They are made of a solid plastic that is not cleanly molded and there are many seams that would & # 34 ; catch & # 34 ; on each other when the fingers were interlaced . The tips we 're not smooth and would catch on the meat . I would not buy these again .	-1
This stuff was great in the start , made 17 gallons , and plant 's did fine ... at first . Three people were using the same brand , after about 2 months every single plant of ours died for some unknown reason . We 've even fertilized them with organic fertilizers . I believe we may have gotten bad coir , I will not be buying this again.I decided to reseed some seeds into the leftover coir , the plants are not doing too well either . I transplanted some of the good plants into regular soil while I could . But while transplanting all the coir was breaking away from the roots exposing the roots to nothing but air . This stuff is horrible to work with . There must be something wrong with it for 3 people to have all their plants die from this coir.Save yourself some time and just get regular organic soil . This was a nightmare for all of us . We 've lost countless hours of work due to this coir .	-1

Havahart 1062 Easy Set Two Door Cage Trap is an interesting device that is used to trap small vermin and animals . I have a problem with skunks , opposums , raccoons and squirrels in my back yard and I thought I 'd give this trap a try . Everything works on it except one of the trap doors does n't want to completely shut . I do n't know why it wont . I tried everything but it does n't want to shut close.Maybe I got a defect . The trap would work , its easy to lift and is rust proof but if the other trap door would close then it would be perfect .	-1
I 've used Havahart traps very extensively in the past , and they usually work great . Flawlessly . I love them.This new model I received is not flawless . The trigger design has changed completely . In the past it was a combination of rods springs and counterweights , which would make the exit door snap down when the animal touched the trigger.The new design uses cables . The cables pull the door ( s ) up and hold the doors open . I think this is causing some problem because if the cable is not the perfect length , i mean , if its even off by a few millimeters , then the trap wo n't set right.Out of the box , the trap seemed to work initially . I pulled the handle and Voila , it was set . Touch the food tray and SNAP it closed . So far so good.The problem started when I just opened ONE door to release the imaginary animal . The door would n't stay open.The trap is supposed to be able to work with one or two doors . It says right on the instructions that you may want to set the trap as a 1 door trap for larger critters . And you certainly do n't want to open BOTH doors when you are letting the animal out , as it could `` run out the back '' and scurry up your leg.After I tried to set it as a 1 door trap , now the 2 door trap wo n't work either . Somehow the trigger mechanism wo n't set right . Whether I try to use it as a 1 door trap or a 2 door trap , the trap wo n't stay open.So it wo n't work at all . Which is really disappointing . I 'm going to contact the manufacturer to see if there is anything that can be done , but , because it is `` easy set '' and you `` just move the lever 1 2 3 '' there is simply nothing else that I can do differently .	-1
I regularly use an older larger version ( I believe it is the next size up ) of the Havahart humane trap . While it does not always catch the critters , it does a decent enough job - say 4 stars . When you run a farm , you can never have too many critter traps esp . when raising critically endangered breeds of birds who are starting to sit on their nests ! Unfortunately this `` new & improved '' version of the Havahart trap is pretty worthless . While it is very easy to open one or both doors , it is another thing entirely to get the door/s to stay open . So far we have not caught a single critter . The trap is always set off though ! Sometimes it is even knocked around . Yet , no critter is inside . I am still keeping it set up on the off chance it does what is supposed to do , but I have very little expectation in finding anything more than an overturned cage with closed doors.This newer version is so sensitive that even a slight bump to the trap causes the doors to snap shut . The only way it 's going to catch a critter is if the bugger does n't sniff at the cage & walks directly inside ! Not very realistic . Hence the closed door & tipped over trap thanks to the critters triggering the hypersensitive door then proceeding to drive themselves crazy pawing at the yummy treats inside ! 'If things miraculously change for the better , I will return to edit my review . In the meantime , do n't bother with this one ! Do yourself a favor & get the traps that have the little metal piece that you can manually fix if needed to insure that the door/s to the trap will stay open .	-1
This trap seems reasonably well constructed and requires no assembly , so I can not really fault the manufacturer , but it has been sitting in our garden with lettuce inside for a few days and the hare that frequented our veggies continues to ignores it . Come to think about it , why would it bother to go inside a metal cage when there is plenty of yummy food outside ? So , I upgraded the bait to a tomato , and the hare cleaned it out without triggering the trap doors . I tried another tomato and switched the trap to one-end-opened-only . The hare again cleaned out the bait and the trap was tripped this time , but the hare was nowhere to be found . I repeated the process with a strawberry , with the same result . The hare must think of this thing as a feeding station now.================================== Added 6/21/2013 ==================================After deploying a wildlife observation camera next to the trap , I finally solved the mystery . It turns out the fruit thief is not the rabbit after all . Instead , the camera caught two chipmunks enjoying the baits . Once the trap is triggered , they simply squeeze through the wire mesh and escape . Amazingly , after all the yummy treats , they do not seem to gain weight.This appears to be a major design flaw . Unless your yard is free of chipmunks and field mice , the baits will go to these little critters without anything to show for them .	-1
I purchased this weeder based on the excellent reviews , but I had a totally different experience with this product . I used this tool for about 1 hr straight today . Mostly I was weeding dandelions ( this weeder really looks to be a take on the traditional dandelion digger , so I thought it would work well ) . But I also used it to weed various other types of weeds throughout the yard and garden.As other reviewers have pointed out , the tool does have very sharp points and is built to last - nice , heavy , one-piece polished aluminum construction and nice quality handle . However , I was very disappointed in the functionality of this tool , mainly because of the design of the functional weeding tip . The widest opening at tip ( top width of the V ) is only 3/8 '' ( actually slightly less than 3/8 '' ) and it is a very narrow V ( the vertical cutting part of the V is 3/4 '' ) . It just did not work for big dandelions - the root of big dandelions is just too large to fit nicely into the cutting area , even if when I used force to try to cut off large roots , it did not work well . I think this is also because the inside cutting edges of the V are very dull , so it does not cut roots well . Also , the V is very narrow and thick and gets clogged with dirt easily . Another point about the design is that the lever is at a very flat , awkward angle and does not work well for `` popping '' weeds . I did try different angles and positions of the Fiskars weeder and it just did not work for me . It seemed to take so much effort to use.The only minor success that I had was in very soft soil in a mulched garden bed , but definitely worse than the standard dandelion digger . It also worked okay for digging under clover on bare soil . I can not imagine using this tool in thick grass or hard dirt . Definitely do not recommend . I will try sharpening my traditional dandelion digger tip and continue using it .	-1
Love Fiskars products but this is not a good product for my use . I have a large garden so this would n't work for me but could be useful for small gardener . Better off using cobra type of weeder .	-1
Like the HItachi trimmer that I bought , this unit had hardening of the gas tubing within a year after purchase . After two years , the tubing was brittle enough that it began to break . I decided to take advantage of the big warranty only to find out : a ) the warranty does n't cover the fuel tubing ( which is what was breaking ) b ) I 'd have to drive & # 62 ; 25 miles to get it servicedc ) the fuel tubing is out of stock everywhere ( presumably because they are all breaking ) I give this two stars because it was a cheap and powerful blower when it was working . But now I have to go buy a new one and I definitely want something that will last longer than three years ! Do n't let the warranty claims fool you ; this is not a good product and Chinese Hitachi does not stand behind it .	-1
Purchased this blower based on the multiple glowing reviews it received.Bought one via 'Warehouse Deals ' which was supposed to be in 'like new ' condition . Box was pretty beaten up and taped in multiple places but blower looked unused to me . Waited for my first day off from work to try it out and on the advice of another reviewer tried the `` TruFuel '' product to use instead of using the gas + oil mixture.Took about 15 pulls on the cord to start it up on first use and then sputtered for some time before finally beginning to run smoothly . With the aggravation of the rough start I would still probably have kept it but in a side by side test with my electric powered Toro Ultra Blower I found almost no difference between what the gas and electric blower could accomplish.Amazon as always has the best customer service and quickly refunded me after I decided that it was n't worth the hassle to deal with this gas blower .	-1
Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development , metabolism , reproductive activity and many more ( E.g. , see Science Daily `` Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally '' , January 22 , 2013 , or Google for a very long list of other articles . The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and does n't seem to be disputed . ) I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not . I received a reply from them that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders . They also explicitly said they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder . Let 's encourage them to change that stance ! I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do . Even if one is n't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds , consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations . Furthermore , consider the food chain and the general fact that we 're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic water bottles without it . This feeder has many great properties , but it 's not the only feeder with them ; personally I will buy alternatives ( of which there are plenty ) until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs . I would love to see them do so .	-1
This thing is ridiculously flimsy and it arrived with crimps and damaged rim . For $ 12 this is ridiculous ... and it has a sticker one it calling it a kitty litterbox cover ... WTF is that ? It 's also not Hydrofarm brand , I own several Hydrofarm products froms grow lights to timers and it 's all high quality which is why I ordered this , I am very disappointed . It works but it 's so thin you have to be very easy with it .	-1
Note : One of the 2 traps broke without catching a mouse and there have been many misses , but the other trap in the 2 pack finally did catch one , so I 'll upgrade from 1 stars to 2 stars . Still not thrilled with these seemingly cheaply made mousetraps , however . My original review follows.Based on my experience , this device is more of a mouse feeding tray than a mousetrap . It 's been used for over 2 weeks , as of this writing , and it has not captured a mouse.The food/bait has been partially or entirely eaten at least 5 times but the trap has not managed to kill the hungry critters . I am assuming that mice absolutely love this device , because it is a terrific source of cheese and peanut butter , available on demand , with little apparent risk of injury to the mouse.The trap snapped shut on my finger and it did n't hurt a bit . Perhaps the is the reason that it 's not catching any mice.The trap was triggered 4 or 5 times , but still no mouse . There were a number of times where the trap was moved around by the mice but did n't even trigger . Based on the fact that in my experience it did not catch a mouse , I ca n't see how it should be rated higher than 1 star.This trap is very lightweight and seems cheaply made and poorly constructed . As metioned , the spring tension seems minimal and is apparently not up to the task . From my perspective , this mousetrap is useless.I will continue to evaulate this trap and if results improve then I will update my review and increase the rating accordingly . But a mousetrap than ca n't catch mice is n't going to do you a whole lot of good.Do n't waste your money on this one . Buy a bigger and better mousetrap . Specifically , I would recommend the Ortho 0321210 Home Defense Max Secure-Kill Rat Trap - 1 Pack which I have also reviewed here at Amazon . This trap is larger , features far better construction and has a spring offering a much higher level of tension . You would not want to get your finger caught in the Ortho 0321210 trap and I have given that mousetrap a 5 star rating.I 've seen some favorable reviews here , but I ca n't share their positive feelings about this product . It is not recommended .	-1
We ordered these when some field mice decided to attack the fuel lines and wires in our two vehicles and cost us a great deal of money to repair . The war is on to kill these little buggers and this is just part of our arsenal to get rid of them . They arrived promptly and as described , but since we put them out , no mice have been caught , so either the mice are gone or hiding . We 'll see and will update this review accordingly then.Overall , they appear durable enough to do the job they were designed for and very easy to handle and set up and the best part , they appear strong and lasting enough to reuse if you can stomach doing so.UPDATE as of 3/22/14 : No mice caught in them and they broke with regular use after owning for just a couple of months . CA N'T RECOMMEND AT ALL ! ! ! ! : ( Used peanut butter as bait and nothing .	-1
I set two of these to try to catch the rats that have been pestering my chickens . Both traps caught a rat . Neither trap killed the rat immediately.The first was pretty horrific , as the trap somehow caught the rat at the hip . The rat crawled a good 25 feet away and was still breathing 8ish hours later when i found it . The second seems to have been a bit faster , as the trap did close on the rat 's head/neck , but the rat was able to crawl about 8 feet away from where the trap was set before finally dying.So if you 're totally ok with this being a grossly INhumane trap , i can say it does seem to _catch_ rats . It 's easy to bate , and there 's no risk of breaking a finger while setting it . However , if you 're queasy about killing and were hoping for something that would kill the vermin so quickly they did n't know what hit them , this is absolutely not the trap to get .	-1
I gave these a good try on my grill tonight , and here were my results : Feel : Charcoal is surprisingly dusty and dirty . It has a fine black dust all over it that gets on everything . Once I had the bag open , I had to double bag the rest to prevent it from getting on my clothing and on everything in my house.Lighting : Charcol lit very easily from a chimney . No problem getting it started.Briquette Burning : Burned very easily -- briquettes turned light grey very quickly and evenly burned.Smoke : No smoke -- -this is a major problem for barbecues . I use hardwood briquettes mostly for the wonderful smoke that infuses the food with flavor . These have no smoke , so they did not create the barbecue flavor.Smell : Did not smell like the barbecue I know and love . Apart from no smoke , they had a strange odor while burning that was not appetizing.Heat : While the briquettes lit quickly and burned evenly , they did not burn very hot . It would be impossible to sear my food with these briquettes , or cool at any reasonable temperature . I had to add a few real briquettes to get my food done.Price : Far more expensive than conventional briquettes.In short , I see nothing redeeming in this product and recommend you do not buy it .	-1
Update : I was going to return these , but I decided to use these . The plants *should* last a month inside these pots if I 'm lucky.Update 2 : Just noticed I 'm missing 20 pots out of the 60 I ordered ! I did n't count them because I was taking them as I needed. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -These are NOT 4 inch pots you will be getting . These are not even deep enough to transplant into . What you 're getting is more like 3 inch pots . Avoid these ! I compared these to my true 4 '' pot 's and these are a lot smaller.Mine came from the seller Seed kingdom .	-1
In the spring small squirrels abound near my bird feeders , but this trap has n't caught any . My other Havahart trap catches many , but this one is too small and the two door thing does n't help . If you 're trying to catch smaller critters , the easy set feature is really nice and the trap may work great , but was a failure for my intended purpose.The trap I received was a little different from the one pictured , so it might have been just a fluke that when I tried the one door method the trigger panel on the bottom was facing the wrong way . There is a large hook on the top of the trap that holds one of the setting wires . When you disengage that wire from the hook , the door to which the wire is attached stays closed when you set the trap . The other wire is connected directly to the other door mechanism and ca n't be released.I tried the trap with both doors open first and did n't catch any critters even though the trap was sprung . The directions say that if that happens , set it with only one door open , so I released the door wire from the top hook . Did n't make sense to me as the squirrel would trigger the panel before it was fully in the cage . After multiple days , no squirrels were caught by this method nor was the trap sprung , so I decided to cut the wire to the door I thought should be the one left open ( per the picture and common sense ) . No takers that way either.It is hard to drop bait into the trap with only one door open because of the slant of the closed door and the fact that it 's a solid panel , so I finally gave up on this trap and returned to the regular Havahart squirrel sized trap which is always effective . It is harder to set , but more sensitive and snaps shut faster which is a requirement for squirrels . Because it is larger , if a big squirrel comes by he will be caught just like a small squirrel , rather than springing the trap and getting away.I hoped this trap would be sturdier because eventually the other trap gets bent and wo n't set anymore so I have to replace it . This one is sturdier , but since it 's not effective for my needs , that does n't help me . I plan to put it in the barn as see if it catches mice , but will return to my regular method for squirrels .	-1
I have a shed full of rats some are endangered species , so I wanted to retrieve them alive and relocate them . The trap is well made but was not as easy to set as it tells you , by simply pulling the handle back . It tripped every time I let the handle go . It only stayed untripped if I pushed in on the through bar before pulling the handle back . I used this with one side closed and baited it with everything from peanut butter on bread , peanuts , cracked corn , cheese and sunflower seeds but never caught the first rat . The food was untouched and the trap was never tripped even though my slightest touch easily tripped it . I placed the bait on the back side of the trip plate but nothing went near it . I then tried to lead them in with a little bait inside the entry as well as over the trip plate still nothing in the trap . Maybe my rats are just too smart to go in this trap . Unfortunately , I had no choice but to use poison we were getting infested . The smell is horrible , all the poison was gone so the rats were still there , they just would n't go near this trap . Maybe it would work on something but it did n't work for rats at all .	-1
I had a rat that liked to hang out in my storage locker and I thought that this would be a humane way of relocating him . However , it was able to eat the bait ( crunchy peanut butter ) without tripping the doors . I had to resort to a conventional & # 34 ; kill trap & # 34 ; and found that the offending rodent was large enough that it should have tripped the lever . Maybe this will work for bigger critters but if it did n't catch my rat it probably should n't list it as a rat trap as mine was fairly large .	-1
I have a couple of Havahart 1025 traps that I use to control a chipmunk epidemic in my yard . They are well built and effective , but they are a bit of a pain to get set up . The 1061 is very solidly constructed , and features a handle for easy , fast , one-hand setting . It seemed like an obvious upgrade , and I wanted to test it in my yard to see for sure . Note that I received this as part of the Amazon Vine program , which means I had just 30 days to test and then post my review.I set the 1061 out along with two of my old 1025 traps . I set the 1061 just a couple feet away from one of the 1025s to get an accurate assessment . In the 30-day period , I caught over 10 chippies total , including 6 in the 1025 nearby the 1061 . I caught nothing in the 1061 , but on many occasions , the bait was missing . On one occasion the trap had triggered , but was empty.After some experimenting , I found two interesting things . First , it takes much more pressure to trigger the 1061 than the 1025 . Second , after the 1061 trips , one of the doors securely locks , but the other doesn & # 8217 ; t. There is an arm that swings down that is supposed to fit into a notch in the door , but the cable that attaches to the handle that opens the door prevents that arm from engaging . With some pressure , it will reopen.This unit is advertised as effective for mice , rats , chipmunks , and small squirrels . Given the pressure required on the trigger , there is no way a mouse would ever spring this trap . Chippies are taking the bait and getting out unscathed , or escaping afterwards . I would recommend using the similarly sized Havahart 1025 instead .	-1
I have been extremely fond ofFiskars Premier Take-Apart Shearsand I liked them so much that when I misplaced one set I ordered three more and put the others aside for safekeeping . So I was intrigued by the Fiskars Cuts+More `` Ultimate Multi-Purpose Scissors '' . Unfortunately , it seemed that Fiskars let the marketing department take over and what we have is a product that promises to do everything , but does none of them well.Let me start with the handle . With the `` Premier '' shears , my hands fit easily and comfortably in the holes and I have good leverage and control , and the action is easy and smooth . With the `` Cuts+More '' , the holes are narrower so my fingers do n't comfortably fit in . Even my wife , who has much smaller hands than I , finds the new pair uncomfortable . There is also considerably less leverage with the `` Cuts+More '' and the tighter fit of the blades means that what should be an easy cut feels like work . The blades are sharp , I 'll give them that , but they lack the scalloping of the `` Premier '' shears that tends to grip items being cut.As for the other things these scissors supposedly do , it does none of them well . The twine and wire cutters are awkward and again lack leverage . Yes , there 's a bottle opener , but it 's awkward to hold the scissors for that purpose and a generic `` church key '' works so much better . The plastic sheath contains two ceramic rods said to be used for sharpening the scissors , but I found this clumsy to use in practice . And the `` tape cutter '' on the sheath is a joke - it just gums up on the tape Amazon uses on its boxes.I do like Fiskars ' take-apart design , as it makes cleaning easy . But the `` Cuts+More '' scissors would not be my first choice to reach for when I have cutting to do , and I would not consider using the extra features at all .	-1
I have owned B & D cordless outdoor equipment for 10+ years . They are of such high quality I rarely need to replace them . But the batteries are so expensive , sometimes it pays to just buy new . Enter this trimmer ... my first use lasted about 3 minutes and I did notice it spun much faster and louder than my previous 18V . I went to hang it back up on the wall but first decided to check the line length remaining out of curiosity . It had maybe 5 inches left ! Huh ? It was a new spool when I installed it . All I did was trim grass , I thought to myself . Next week I installed a new line and made absolute sure that I was trimming grass and not dirt . Same result . I called B & D and was told this was an issue with the older models but not this one . She sent me a replacement for free . I tried the second one and had the exact same experience . Back it went as well . I am just going to replace batteries in my old model because using a spool a use compared to one every year is just ridiculous to me .	-1
Its not as strong as I 'd like it to be . Do n't expect it to chop thick weeds . The worst part is the battery life . It takes hours of charging to get minutes of use	-1
I have one Black and Decker Cordless trimmer/it is very weak does not trim any thing I expected . Now I see the Worx GT on TV . I would not buy it . Too good to be true .	-1
My other grasshog trimmer died after 8 years , and I picked this one up . Like others the auto-feeder had issues . It was binding on itself , would spit out too much line and get twisted up . It was horrible . I went to my local Home Depot and talked to them and they said `` most of these come back . '' I will probably try another B & D but I would stay away from this one until they work the issues out .	-1
This Black and Decker dual line trimmer works well enough . However , it has an auto feed line dispenser . I prefer the old style bump feed .	-1
We had pantry moths . Really . No denying it . So I threw out all our contaminated or potentially contaminated food . I know that you would generally expect to have some adults lurking around . We had a big enough infestation that I 'm sure they were around somewhere . I put a few of these traps out all over the pantry . I caught ZERO moths . I thought maybe i put them in the wrong place so I opened the second package and pretty much had them littered everywhere . I I finally caught one.. By the time I gave up I caught one moth and one spider spider that had probably wandered onto the trap . Maybe mine were old , I 'm not sure . I expected to catch more than one based on the amount of larvae I came across ! I changed our storage method and have been moth-free since . But its probably more to do with the storage than removing the adults !	-1
These did not work for me at all , I have moths from both my lovebird seed and alsofrom the wood stove pellets I use as cat litter . I have moths fluttering all over the place ! I put up two of these and they did not attract anything other than one got a spider whocame out of hiding due to spring has arrived.I did catch a couple moths , but it was obvious they accidentally fluttered against it ratherthan swarmed it due to the pheromone . I wish these would have worked for me !	-1
I was very excited to be receiving a new Adirondack ( plastic ) chair , but was disappointed with it after assembling it . I would never pay $ 349.00 for this chair . Maybe for a set of 4 of them but not individually because it 's simply not worth the price . It was difficult to assemble , and damaged upon arrival . The damage was not caused during shipping but done at the factory . The front slat that has the little logo sign on it was split from someone at the factory over-screwing the hole and splitting the plastic . On one of the legs are several pre-drilled screw holes that were obviously a mistake made at the factory . The overall quality of the chair is average.It is very large so I would think that a robust person could easily recline in it . However , only the last two of the three reclining positions are useable . The first one which has the back of the chair in it 's most upright position has the back almost forward . You ca n't possibly sit in the chair with the back that far forward because it 's very awkward and uncomfortable . The other two reclining positions are very comfortable and with a cushion you could easily fall asleep in this chair.The assembly instructions could have been better . If you buy this chair please be aware that the armrests have another part ( board ) that you rotate down to attach to the front of the chair . The instructions did not mention that and it took us ( husband and I ) a while to figure that out . The pictures in the instructions are adequate and just enough parts are given but no extras . It comes with a small bit head to insert in your electric screwdriver which you will definitely need . Also , you better have a medium sized 7/16 socket wrench or else you are going to be spending a long time screwing in some long bolts . The instructions do say it 's best to use a 7/16 socket wrench and for good reason.Honestly , if I had purchased this chair at the current price of $ 349.00 , I would be trying to return it . The plastic seems durable enough , but I have n't had it long enough to see if it off-gasses in our intense southern heat . The color is a darkish-gray brown and there are no rough edges except for where the slat is split on the front . I will try contacting the company by e-mail ( no phone number is given in the enclosed papers ) and see if they will send me a replacement slat . If they are cooperative I might raise the star level by one star . And , though it will flatten down some , it took both of us to get it unflattened and back into a useable position . It 's difficult to adjust the back positions and impossible to do while sitting in the chair . It does n't work smoothly like a chaise lounge chair . Definitely not an easy chair to flatten and toss in the car for a trip to the beach . And it 's kind of heavy . It would have to be a rather short carrying distance if you want to physically haul it somewhere .	-1

The unit was easy to setup and use . It worked fine for the first cook , but when I went to use it for a second cook , the meat probe read 151 degrees when I first turned it on . I swapped the probes and the problem moved so my guess is that it is the probe . I am returning this . I am not going to hassle with the time and expense of replacing probes all the time .	-1

Battery does n't last long at all . Barely enough to trim and edge front yard of my normal sized lot in a subdivision .	-1
For this price and size , the diameter of the disc should be thicker . I currently have a few houseplants around the living room which I filled with large rocks . Works fine for when they thrive and just sit there . But when I had a plant die last winter , I had to convince hubby to drag the whole heavy pot , palm fronds in his face , out to the yard in the snow and dead of winter to dump it out so I could replace it . Enter , Garden Genius pot fillers . I find that the material is fantastic for letting water drain through and helps prevent roots from just sitting in standing water . However , once you place a ton of soil and your plant on top of it , the disc is pretty much flattened out . I 'm not entirely sure how helpful it is with drainage at that point . On the plus side , it keeps the soil from leaking out of the bottom of the drainage holes in my planter.Garden Genius has a cheaperalternativein the form of a roll which you can cut to measure . Moreover , you can layer these so that you have a little more volume to stand up to the weight of the soil.But an even cheaper alternative ? Buy something fragile here on Amazon and hope for packing peanuts . Another time trusted method for very large pots is using discarded plastic containers such as milk jugs , yogurt cups , soda cans , etc . You can layer the plastic containers or packing peanuts along the bottom , cover with a sheet of landscape fabric or burlap , then put soil on top . Ta Da ! If you found this review helpful , please let met know ! Thanks !	-1
Here is a product that even though I own , I still do n't fully understand . It 's supposed to lighten the weight of pots ... but it 's just not deep enough to make a good difference . It 's also so porous that it 's not easy to really clean well.Wish I had something better to report , but I think I 'm just going to continue using rocks for pot drainage .	-1
These are not likely to be investigated and messed with by a kid or a pet ( cat or a dog ) , can kill multiple mice at once ( up to 4 ) , and unlike others , can only be used indoors.I like that these come pre-loaded and are disposable . With this product , you can just kill all the mice and never need to touch the poison.They eat the poison from the station and die elsewhere . The biggest problem with this product and with poisoning mice ( besides the inhumane treatment of poisoning mice ) is that cats or dogs cat then eat the dead mice and then the pets die that way . Although this product is good at making sure that children and other pets do not get to the poison , the fact that the mice will die somewhere in the house and might be then eaten by your pets who will then die is scary .	-1
Even considering just Motomco 's rodent control products , there 's enough to drive a person crazy . Snap traps , glue traps , spin traps , and several different types of bait stations . Of them all , this is perhaps the last I 'd choose ( except maybe the glue traps ... I hate to see animals suffer like that ) . While I 'm not a fan of poisons ( I prefer snap traps ) , there are four different , very similar products , and it 's hard to keep them straight : Mouse Killer : Disposable , kid and pet safe , and can be used both indoors and outdoors.Mouse Killer I ( Best choice ! ) : Refillable , kid and pet safe , and both indoors/outdoors.Mouse Killer II ( this product ) : Disposable . Kid ( not pet ) safe , and indoors only.Mouse Killer III : Refillable . Kid ( not pet ) safe , and indoor only.Of the four , Mouse Killer I makes the most sense to me . It 's as safe as they get , and refillable ( and therefore more cost-effective in the long run ) . They all come with the same poison , so there 's no difference there . That one has an additional covering over the entrance the others do n't have , making it a little more tamper resistant , and a bit more attractive to mice , which like such things.The disadvantage of poisons ? They do n't work right away , and the rodents may go off and die in a place where you ca n't get to them , but their rotting corpses still stink up your house.My preferred option is still snap traps , which are infinitely reusable without purchasing additional products ( poisons , etc ) , and much cheaper , especially when obtained at a local hardware store .	-1
Our two basic wooden mousetraps that we have in our garage have caught over 100 mice with just peanut butter on them . I do n't see any need for these and especially when they are deadly to humans and pets . Not worth the risk .	-1
With several backyard chickens , our garage is a host for little mice . We store all of our grains in the garage , and no matter how clean I keep the garage and how secure I keep the grain , we still manage to have the pitter patter of little feet running through . I put the Tomcat Mouse Killer in the garage to help control the number of mice I see there . Even despite after eating the bait , I noticed a few green tinged poops and after the bait was completed , I still saw evidence of little visitors in my garage . Either I have a lot more mice that I thought , or this stuff is n't working . I decided to get a few old fashioned snap traps which seem to be working much more effectively , even though it 's not nearly as pretty .	-1
I thought the warning label on this said safe around kids and pets . It looks like it is a trap that has bait inside it and the mouse is supposed to eat it inside the trap and die there . Well , that 's not the case , they eat the poison in the trap and then can leave and go anywhere . I 'm afraid to use this and kill off my dog , who definitely likes to eat mice when she can find them . So , it IS an issue if you have pets who might eat the poisoned mouse . I 'm not willing to risk it . This also poses a risk to wild animals , if the mouse should wander outside to die and a bird eats it . Honestly , saying the trap is kid-safe and pet safe leads you to believe that you wo n't have to worry about anything eating poison other than the rodent -- which is n't the case .	-1

I found an ant hill in my yard , so I put the stakes around it , but , unfortunately , I did n't notice any difference with ant activity . The hill is alive and thriving . I used the same maker 's liquid ant baits for indoors and they wiped out ants in just a few days , I am surprised why those did not work .	-1
These would be a great idea and value if they were much thicker for the same price . The 6.25 '' disk is 7/8 '' thick . Too thin to get any real weight savings , you would have to stack several and then it becomes impractically expensive.In very large pots it is nice to be able to cut back the amount of dirt required to fill the pot to reduce the weight and save on potting soil . But when something as simple and cheap as crushed aluminum cans works well why spend a lot of money to buy enough of these to get the job done .	-1
This filler/filter is about 3/4 '' thick and feels like Velcro . Its sturdy and will help fill the bottom voids of your 6.25 inch planter pot . This is particularly handy as it helps to drain your pot and keep it lightweight if it is a hanging pot . But the price is way over the top . I would need to use at least 2-4 of these to make them useful for my planter pot . Even though it is washable , I would suggestOnward Multi Corp 05002 7 lb . Lava RockorCinders - 3.3 lb Bag Lava Rockwhich can be purchased at most nursery or garden shop or on Amazon.com . Lava rocks are inexpensive , washable and take up empty space for draining just as well . Shop wisely .	-1
Ok , if you are any kind of a gardener , you know you ca n't put a plant in a pot without any openings in the bottom becauseit could become water logged and the leaves will turn brown . The roots need space between the soil for oxygen . Like most gardeners , I usually add some rocks or broken clay tiles on the bottom of pots without any drainage holes . The idea of this product , Durable Pot Filler Disc , is to place this disc on the bottom of the pot before putting in the soil and plant and it will provide breathing room for the roots . When I debate if I am going to buy these discs or use some rocks , pebbles , or broken tiles I have laying around , I am going to use what I already have . You can reuse these discs but you can also reuse rocks . What I have seen suggested in gardening books is to buy the material used for these discs in a roll a cut your own which would make it cheaper . The material it is made out of is like what is used in some evaporative cooler pads , not the straw or cardboard ones , the plastic ones .	-1
Since I wrote my original review , the four CAMCO 50 foot hoses that we bought , all have developed bad kinks , several of which now leak ( because the hose totally broke down ) . There is no way I can recommend this product and I hope that other customers do n't have the severe problems with these CAMCO hoses , that we 've had.Original review : We bought three of these Camco `` premium '' drinking water hoses recently , and they KINK something fierce . Furthermore , since this hose is heavier and firmer , when it kinks , the bend itself does n't resolve and it tends to kink over and over at the same place or places . I love the hose otherwise , but the design is either defective or we got a couple of bad Camco hoses ! I ca n't recommend this hose at all , due to this severe problem !	-1
There are the good and bad ... PROS.1 . The water spray is adequate..2 . It is light weight in comparison to its competitors ... CONS.1 . It is very hard to start..2 . Briggs and Stratton gas engines run rough . They are not as smooth as Honda..3 . Mine lasted only a year . I did not use it much - three times or nine hours total..4 . It is cheaply built . Too many plastic parts are used .	-1
This pressure washer is hard to start and has a lousy carburetor that will fill your crankcase with gas while leaking all over the ground . This is a & # 34 ; one year & # 34 ; design and the pump is light duty . Expect to get about 15 days of service out of it before the pump craps out . Their customer service people are not much help either .	-1
Maybe if this was just a few bucks for this little space filler , then this product might be worth it . However , why not just use some wood chips/mulch , styrofoam peanuts , or those little air bags that Amazon loves to package with your purchases for free or negligible cost ? Even though the product itself works fine , I do not see the value proposition here .	-1
The Dirt Devil ND40100 is three tools ; a pressure washer , a wet/dry vac and a blower . Without a rigid extension tube included for the blower , that particular feature may get little use . Otherwise , it 's nice to have all three units in one place . Note that this particular configuration does not include the sprayer 's large wedge brush as can be seen in the product page 's caddy-view and dude-washing-deck stock photos . Additionally , the ND40100 is only for use with cold water.As shipped , the unit requires assembly . It 's easy to do and all you need is a `` Phillips '' screwdriver . To assemble , first of put the accessory rack in place and secure it with one screw on each side . Next , secure the handle to each of the two sides ( manufactured to fit only one way ) using two screws per side . Finally , attach and secure the handle assembly to the water pressure unit using two screws per side . That 's it as far as assembly goes.The pressure washer and the wet/dry vac are two physically separate units , which optionally occupy the same space . The pressure washer doubles as a shelf for the vacuum and it also houses the accessory caddy.With only 1800PSI of pressure , it 's light duty but it performs satisfactorily for the home . It made short work of cleaning the siding and it cleaned the walkways well . It does more impressive scraping with full-jet applied.My variable fan spray wand 's high and low pressure ( + to - ) adjustment slider was very stiff initially . I had to push and pull fairly hard until finally it broke free ; even now the wand tip has trouble sliding in and out - soap will only dispense with the wand set at low ( - ) pressure . The wand can shoot a powerful jet while set either at a straight stream or slightly into the fan range , which is where it needs to be to remove the most set in dirt and dense mosses . With the sprayer set to wider fan angles , it lacks such scraping power but provides an effective surface sweep . ** Edit November 23 , 2012 : With all my might , I could not get the pressure wand to go from high to low today ; I used a nearby flat object to pry them nozzle loose . I hope Dirt Devil has modified the newer batches of variable fan spray wands - oftentimes , mine feels like trying to tear a steel bar into two pieces . End edit . **The rotary brush is nice to have , especially for washing the car . Water shoots into the mill-style gears to spin the brush.Regarding usage , having the washer 's power cord on the lower back and its hose inlet and sprayer outlet on the lower front makes it cumbersome to tilt back and roll while connected . The unit is light enough , even more so without the vacuum on it , that the unit can be better moved by picking it up by the handle.The little shop vac is okay . I like it . Though it 's no powerhouse , it 's portable and lightweight with enough suction for surface debris . It is convenient for interior car detailing , but because the included crevice accessory is so short , it 's hard to get far in between a car seat and a center console , but typical accessories for many other vacuums will fit the hose on this vacuum just as well . The brush accessory works great ; it 's fine for the car dash and it makes lampshades look nice again . The wide tool is ... included.Overall , I really like the ND40100 . The price is fair for what you get . The product is well equipped with a decent length power cord and the pressure sprayer 's hose is a generous length as well . The product would be better with more secure cord storage and a full-length crevice tool .	-1
Do n't waste your money . The birds would not eat this product . I tried putting it in different types of feeders , mixing it with BOSS and spreading it the ground . Nope ... nothing .	-1
Unfortunately , we have too many black birds and sparrows to appreciate putting out these mealworms . It 's just not for us , but I thought I would give it a try to attract some other type birds .	-1
I like that these are disposable . however , you must touch the posion to load them , which is a hassle , to put it mildly.The mice eat the poison from the station and die elsewhere . The biggest problem with this product and with poisoning mice ( besides the inhumane treatment of poisoning mice ) is that cats or dogs cat then eat the dead mice and then the pets die that way . Although this product is good at making sure that children and other pets do not get to the poison , the fact that the mice will die somewhere in the house and might be then eaten by your pets who will then die is scary .	-1
With several backyard chickens , our garage is a host for little mice . We store all of our grains in the garage , and no matter how clean I keep the garage and how secure I keep the grain , we still manage to have the pitter patter of little feet running through . I put the Tomcat Mouse Killer in the garage to help control the number of mice I see there . Even despite after eating the bait , I noticed a few green tinged poops and after the bait was completed , I still saw evidence of little visitors in my garage . Either I have a lot more mice that I thought , or this stuff is n't working . I decided to get a few old fashioned snap traps which seem to be working much more effectively , even though it 's not nearly as pretty . Because the bait was not effectively , I have not use for a refillable station . Maybe you 'll have better luck than me - but for did n't work in our household .	-1
This is effective enough for killing mice , but it 's a threat to pets , especially cats . Kids are less likely to get into the product , but it 's not really worth the chance . However , if your home is pet free and kid free , but has a mouse population , this will work well .	-1
The design is such that pets and children would have to work to get at the poison . However , the poison is Bromethalin . One dose is lethal to rodents , and they die within 24 to 36 hours . The downside to this is that they may go elsewhere and die , which may be someplace that you do not want a decomposing creature.A persistent dog could chew on this , and it is deadly to dogs ( and even more so to cats , but they are less likely to be randomly chewing on plastic , at least from what I have observed ! ) . There is no antidote , so if you have a rambunctious dog , you might want to consider a snap trap ( annoying to a dog , but not lethal ) .Now , does it work ? In my experience , nope . I placed these traps along with an electronic trap , and a couple of snap traps along the wall in my garage where I KNOW mice run ( we catch about a half dozen a week ) . After 10 days I pried the station open ( which is not recommended ) to be sure the bait had been gnawed . It had not.I think I would rather go back to my old fashioned snap traps ( at least I know where the dead mice are ) or my new fangled electrocution chamber ( which also kills instantly ) .I did put it outside now ( where if the mice die someplace else I do not have to smell them ) , and if I see that the bait is taken I will report back . As a note , the Tier 3 ( which is less resistant to pets , did show signs of mouse activity )	-1
I do have a rat problem at my house . They move back and forth between the attic and the backyard . So I had hoped that this would help cut down their numbers a bit by placing this strategically in areas where I know they occur . In the entire time that I have had this , evidently not a single rat has been fooled into nibbling on the bait , because it is still the same as it was the day I opened it . Even placing it in areas where I know rats have been , the bait was not touched . I do n't know how to judge the success of something like this , which has a delayed effect , but I do know how to judge its failure , and in my case this failed .	-1
I 've had this in place for nearly three weeks , but the bait block is still a perfect rectangle with sharp corners and not a nibble nibbled off.In that time , i 've seen rats in the area . I can actually see where they 've modified their little race track to go around the bait station instead of interacting with it.And the whole point of the pre-loaded bait station is to keep the bait off your hands . Too bad the box was full of bait-dust , so it got all over my hands anyway .	-1
I was hoping this was just a trap , instead it is a bait station loaded with a toxic green wafer as 'food ' . I do not recommend , there 's been more than a few family pets lost due to eating poisoned mice , unfortunately .	-1
This is refillable . 16 refills run about $ 9 right now in early June , 2014 , of course prices can fluctuate over time.I 've used poisons in the past , with little boxes that had pellets that I 'd hide deep in cabinets . This is different . This is a little plastic box with a lid , that has the bait in it . This looks to be a lot safer than the box kind . The bait is in hard big block forms , and a mouse can get to it easily , but a cat , even a small kitten , ca n't . That 's important to me as we own cats.The active ingredient in this is not Coumadin , but Bromethalin , a neurotoxin that causes paralysis and death . It can also be toxic in the food chain.My first reaction to the product was and is positive , and I think it would be good for some households.However , my cats love to eat mice . They love it so much I should not even have mice , but I live in an area that is close to woods with some abandoned homes , and everyone that lives here seems to be constantly fighting them . I 'm scared to use this because this contains a pretty powerful neurotoxin that can kill cats if they EAT a mouse or mole that 's been poisoned with this . If I 'd realized it , I 'd not have picked this product out.They would probably be great for non-cat owners , or people that own cats that are n't mousers . For me , I 'll stick with my cats and my hens ( They eat moles and mice like crazy too ! Sometimes they fight the cats over one . ) If I have to , I 'll use the old snap traps and peanut butter . I just do n't trust my babies with this .	-1
A key thing to realize with this trap 's bait is that it killed the mice when there was no other food to be had . That suggests that , out in the real world , a mouse would rather wander off and eat something else rather than take a big blue bite of the brick inside this bait station . I can say , with certainty , that the mice snacking on my garden have zero interest in this product .	-1
Purchased two packs of these stakes from Amazon . Less than a week in the ground the stakes are cracked , dry and brittle . Too expensive sticks to have broken down so fast . Never would I buy these stakes again . They are definitely not for use in a garden bed .	-1
I purchased these to clip climbing roses to ; our roses are extremely tall and top-heavy . These stakes are skinny - a little bigger in diameter than a standard # 2 pencil - and very bendy , so that it was awkward ( and I ultimately gave up ) trying to push them down into the soil . In any case I 'm not certain they would have held up the roses ! Since they were so inexpensive we will probably throw them in the shop for craft use or something , but they wo n't work for tying up roses .	-1
A bag of catfood in the laundry room closet got superinfested with Pantry Moths . Although I got ready of the bag of catfood , there must have been 1000 larvae in the room.I sprayed the room with an insecticide and closed the door for a couple of days but still saw emerging moths . Then I stuck in one of these traps and a bowl of water . I knew to use the latter because the moths kept drowning themselves in the cat 's waterbowl.Four days later and I have a water bowl full of dead moths and exactly three moths stuck in their little moth hotel . Guess it 's time to bring in the steam cleaner .	-1
No option for ZERO stars , had to give it one star ? ! Last year I bought the Terro brand . It took a few weeks but they caught all the moths eventually . The Terro 's traps were filled up within a month and the entire moth population died off . However , a few weeks ago , I noticed moths returning so immediately went to Amazon to buy more traps but bought the wrong kind . These Catchmaster traps are NOT working ! The moths are living and flying happily around . I 'm so disgusted that I did n't re-order the same brand that I bought before , not realizing it was Terro that had worked previously . I do NOT recommend these . I believe I 've received defective traps or the & # 34 ; bait & # 34 ; is expired . There is no option to get a replacement ... just an option to send them back . It 's too much trouble and time/expense to package them up and travel to the post office to return these . I 'll quickly go order the Terro brand that I had before and hopefully , let this be a lesson learned for all . This is a sad , troubling experience . I 'm usually happy with Amazon . Not this time !	-1
Both this product and the trap it goes into did zero to help get rid of stink bugs . Waste of money . Do n't bother .	-1
The trap did n't work , and the refills do not work . Stink bugs galore -- everywhere but in this worthless trap ! A rip off !	-1
I purchased this and found it to be a waste of money . It does not attrack the stink bugs like it claims . They still come t the house	-1
This product does not do a better job than rocks or gravel . While it is easy to drop into your container ( and putting in rocks would take about two more minutes ) I do n't think it provides a value . When you factor in the high price , I feel any weight benefits are terribly overshadowed . I do not have to move my gardening pots very often anyway . I also keep five pots on my deck and purchasing this filler disc for all of them would be prohibitive . It states that it is long-lasting but ... . Is it going to be longer lasting than the rocks I have used in the past ? These rocks are mostly cultivated from my own backyard and add no additional expense . I suppose if you need to move your pots several times a day and have money to burn , this may be of some value to you .	-1
I have to think that the inventor of this product is laughing himself sick somewhere , astounded yet delighted that anyone would pay money for this.First of all , with the name 'Pot Filler ' , I expected this product to , you know , FILL a pot . It 's barely an inch thick for heaven 's sake . It does n't fill anything ! It sits on the bottom of a pot , to provide drainage.Secondly , it purports to make your pots lighter . Ummm ... not so much . Because yeah , it 's lighter than other things you can use to provide drainage ( broken clay pots , pebbles , etc ) , but really - who uses enough of those things to make an appreciable difference in the weight of a pot ? I typically use one or two shards of clay . The weight of a potted plant is caused by the soil , and this 'genius ' disc does n't allow for less soil - it 's too thin ! So you still have to fill most of your pot up with ( heavy ) dirt . How is this helpful ? Third , it 's ridiculously expensive ! $ 32 for ONE disc ? Who has money to throw away like that , when the alternatives people have been using for drainage for years are free ? Well I guess there 's a sucker born , etc ... . I got this product from Vine so I paid nothing for it , thankfully.BOTTOM LINE : Ludicrously overpriced thin piece of mesh to use in place of gravel ( or other free drainage materials ) at the bottom of your planters . I can see no point to it whatsoever . I grudgingly give 2 stars as it is apparently washable and reusable .	-1
The concept is great but it is a pricey solution . I had to alter the size to fit my pots and once they were in place , and I had to add the huge bag of soil , there was no real overall weight savings and I 'm pretty sure the material was compressed by all of the soil 's weight . I 'm probably going back to packing peanuts and or upside down pots at the bottom to save both weight and money .	-1
I 'm laughing at myself right now for being silly enough to order this . This is essentially a big scrubbie pad for a pot . It is about 1 inch thick . If I were to want to fill a larger , deeper pot than say 12 inches , it would be cheaper to use all potting soil and buy a handtruck to move the pot around on . Come on ! ! Where 's the genius to this ? ? I will just continue to add styrofoam packing peanuts to the bottom of really large pots that I use . For some reason I had the forlorn hope that this was going to be something special . Maybe something that expanded when wet or was thick enough to do the job with just one . For this cost It should be impregnated with gold and fertilizer to boot !	-1
I totally agree with another review that for this price and size , the diameter of the disc should be thicker . I currently have a few houseplants around the living room which I filled with large rocks . Works fine for when they thrive and just sit there . But when I had a plant die last winter , I had to convince hubby to drag the whole heavy pot , palm fronds in his face , out to the yard in the snow and dead of winter to dump it out so I could replace it . Enter , Garden Genius pot fillers . I find that the material is fantastic for letting water drain through and helps prevent roots from just sitting in standing water . However , once you place a ton of soil and your plant on top of it , the disc is pretty much flattened out . I 'm not entirely sure how helpful it is with drainage at that point . On the plus side , it keeps the soil from leaking out of the bottom of the drainage holes in my planter.Garden Genius has a cheaperalternativein the form of a roll which you can cut to measure . Moreover , you can layer these so that you have a little more volume to stand up to the weight of the soil.But an even cheaper alternative ? Buy something fragile here on Amazon and hope for packing peanuts . Another time trusted method for very large pots is using discarded plastic containers such as milk jugs , yogurt cups , soda cans , etc . You can layer the plastic containers or packing peanuts along the bottom , cover with a sheet of landscape fabric or burlap , then put soil on top . Ta Da ! If you found this review helpful , please let me know !	-1
This is a giant pot scrubber . It is the exact same material that you buy at the grocer but oversize to fill flower pots . Does it work ? Yes , water drains easily through it . It fills the bottom of a pot and is lighter weight than using rocks , however , there are much more cost effective methods for pot fillers . I can not recommend this product at this cost . 2 stars only because it does what it claims .	-1
As pot fillers go , this is arguably a little easier . But please pardon my cynicism when I suggest that there are plenty of other alternatives . Basically , this is a pricey alternative to any number of other ways to add a little space at the bottom of a flower pot . Is it neater ? Yes . Is it the best alternative ? Not in my opinion . I can use a lot of other erstwhile non-recyclable material that I do n't have to pay for , and get the same result .	-1
This *seems* like a good idea ... I had thought my pots would use less soil and be lighter . These technically make the pots a little lighter , but not enough to justify the cost . Basically , the larger the pot , the more the soil smashes these pot fillers flat , making the soil savings negligable . I am going to continue using rocks to drain my pots .	-1
Well , the price is OK , but while I expected some of the ladybugs to be DOA , it looked to me that out of 1500 about 300-400 came dead . I will look for local suppliers in the future .	-1
This was shipped by standard USPS postage , I think it took about 5 days to get here . About half of the bugs were dead . I followed the directions with the nectar , hoping to keep some of the bugs in my garden , but all but a few left in the next couple of days . I guess I did n't have enough insects for them to eat . But about a month later , my ( down wind ) neighbor was telling me about all the ladybugs in her garden . I was at least happy someone got the benefit .	-1
I have released them in the night but they only stay for one and half day they all checked out or became birds food .	-1
This was my original review : All of my ladybugs were alive when I received them ! They were beautiful . I bought them because I am having a problem with white flies in my lawn , and other aphids on some of my plants.They arrived quickly . They were packaged well with a refrigerate pack to make sure that did not get too hot . They came with a sheet of wonderful instructions . They also came with a small pack of nectar to sprinkle out with them to help keep them nearby . But , I also ordered the larger bag of it when I order these.I was very happy with this transaction.THIS IS MY ADDITIONAL REVIEW : These lady bugs are Asian lady bugs . They are not native . They do bite when their food source gets low ; as in late in the year . They become aggressive . I had several bites . I could not believe it ! Then , I did some research on line and found out . Asian ladybugs also eat the larvae of native ladybugs . You are much much better off getting lacewings . I bought those too , and they worked great ! And they will not bite you or kill beneficial insects .	-1
It 's rare I give a 1-star review but in this case I have 4 pounds of useless rat poison . I 'm sure if that rats eat this stuff they will die but here in California at least the rats are too smart for this stuff . I put it in one of their travel paths and they POOPED on this indicating they just walked right over it . ZERO bite marks on the bait . Since I have 4 pounds of it I 'm thinking of adding peanut butter to it but I really should n't have to do that . I bought some pellet packs at home depot ( about $ 1 each , really cheap ) and the rats LOVE those.I also find it interesting that many of the 5-star reviews for this product are either from reviewers who have ONLY reviewed this product or else gave a bunch of other 5 star reviews the same day as they reviewed this product then have n't reviewed anything else since . Hmmm..Sorry , ca n't recommend .	-1
Do n't expect this to remove the Green Stuff from your siding just with water and spray . You still need to get on a ladder and scrub . I do n't see any special results with this cleaner . In fact , I have better results with Simple Green . I ca n't recommend this .	-1
What a let down . We recently bought a house that 's vinyl siding had not been cleaned in ages . I was excited to try this product , but after carefully following the directions , I could see no difference between using it or powerwashing with plain water . Save your money . The only plus was that it is supposedly safe for plants , but what does that matter if it does n't clean well ?	-1
upon reading the instructions , we determined that it would be too dangerous to try and use this product on the house as we have many decorative plants and flowers ; also the presence of two dogs makes us too nervous about using it .	-1
We power wash our house once or twice a year , and usually use bleach to remove mold from the siding on one end of the house . I mixed this Krud Kutter and sprayed it as directed , but it did n't remove any of the mold , or even do a good job washing off bird poop or bug stains . It actually did n't work any better than using plain water . We ended up having to use bleach water and a scrub brush , as usual.I 'm all for & # 34 ; going green & # 34 ; with products that work . I use vinegar in my mop water and it does a great job on my kitchen floors . I use lemon or vinegar in water for window washing , and they sparkle . I use vinegar and baking soda to clean and unplug our drains . But when a product sacrifices performance for the sake of being green , I wo n't buy it again .	-1
I have used other Krud Kutter products that are outstanding . Consequently , I was eager to try this product on my aluminum house and white vinyl fence . It caused no change to the surface of the aluminum siding . It did not do nearly enough to cut the seasonal green mold on the vinyl fence , even full strength with a brush . Letting it sit awhile did not bring a better result . I expected better , and will keep looking for some application where it eases a cleaning chore .	-1
I got this to use when I do my annual siding and driveway power washing because it says it cleans vinyl/aluminum siding , gutters , roofs , stucco , and brick and also contains Sporex to clean off mold and mildew . I have green mildew on some of my vinyl siding and was excited to give this a try to hopefully avoid using a scrubbing brush and make it easier to clean . I used this exactly as directed and while I did like the low odor factor , it did nothing else that plain water and my power washer could n't do alone.I used this on the mildew and it did n't even come off , even after letting it sit for a few minutes , so I had to use the scrub brush anyway . I also used this on my concrete driveway and sidewalks to try to get rid of some rust colored stains and it did n't make any difference , plus I still had to use a scrub brush to get stains off . Bottom line , save the $ 11.99 and just use plain water because the results will be the same !	-1
Living in the Great Pacific Northwest has its challenges , including dealing with moss and fungus on your house siding and gutters . As such , I was looking for an environmentally friendly product that would not hurt plants , people , or animals . The material advertising on this product sounded like it meet those requirements , so I went ahead and ordered it.When the product arrived , I started reading all of the fine print and immediately became concerned with the requirement to soak all plants that might become contaminated by this product and to then flush with lots of water after use . I went to the company website and looked up the material safety data sheet on this product and was concerned when it listed that rubber gloves , protective clothing , and a canister respirator should be used when using this product unless you could ensure that particulate count could remain very low and that you would not be in contact with the spray . Now I do not know about you , but when I use a pressure washer there is NO way to keep from getting some spray on yourself or to control the amount of mist in the air . So , using this in a pressure washer tank seemed to not be in the cards since I do not own a hazmat suit.The other recommended way of applying this was to use a pump sprayer with a diluted solution , so I opted for that , used rubber gloves , wore a rain jacket , and a respirator . I also covered all of the plants with a plastic tarp after first soaking the plants and then when I was done , I uncovered the plants and rinsed them again.Ok , so much for the preliminary , here is what I found.I followed the instructions for dilution and sprayed on the material to half of one side of the house . I then let it soak , but did not let it dry on the siding and gutters before using the pressure washer to remove the material . I then proceeded to use the pressure washer without any additives to do the second half of that side of the house . Since the entire side was pretty evenly dirty , I thought this would give me a good comparison to pressure washer versus Krud Kutter and pressure washer.After I let it dry , I then asked my wife to look at it and tell me if she saw any difference between both halves of the house side . She could not see any difference ( as a note , it looked the same to me as well ) . I did not tell her which part was washed with what.So , after all of that , I did not see any difference and thus do not see the reason to use this product . I am also not comfortable with the description of the safety of this product on plants and such after reading the filing with the EPA on the product and also looking up the active ingredients in the product ( sodium metasilicate pentahydrate , and alcohol ethoxylate ) . As an additional note , the proprietary formulation that they will not divulge ( alcohol ethoxylate ) is on the California list of known chemicals that can cause reproductive issues.Thus , I would NOT recommend this product .	-1
We have to clean our vinyl siding 2 x a year because we live near a busy street and because we have neighbors that like to have burn pits going in their yards during the summer . That all adds up to some greasy siding.I followed the directions and was n't happy after the first wash - the grease was still thick in the little fake wood grainy bumps on the siding . I was hoping it was because I used the hose even though we do have really good water pressure . A week later I decided to try it using the pressure washer and while that took a little more off , I still was n't real pleased with the results . What I have left I 'm just going to use for things I can scrub in addition to spraying , like the lawn furniture etc . It does remove grease - it just needs you to scrub too so as a siding wash it was a fail for me .	-1
I was really hoping that this product would work well and I could give it a good review . I followed the directions and applied it to our vinyl siding with low pressure , using the gas power washer . I waited about 3-5 minutes as directed . The siding and plants had been wet with water previously . The problem area of our house is on the north side and we power wash it every year . The problem is dirt , green mildew or mold and black spots from some kind of mold.When I power washed it after the Krud Kutter application , the dirt came off as usual , some of the green stuff came off more easily than usual , but it did nothing to the black spots . In order to remove them I have always had to get within 10 inches of the siding with the power spray , sometimes closer . I had to do this using the Krud Kutter as well.I tried using the Krud Kutter at a stronger solution , but no difference . The reason I had really hoped this stuff would work better is that we have a two story house and I can no longer get up high enough on the ladder to get the upper floor.If all you have to remove and clean is surface dirt from a distance , it works okay , otherwise do n't bother .	-1
I would n't recommend this trimmer to a friend . It 's a LOT of trimmer for a very LITTLE benefit . The lack of line feeding alone is enough to drive you mad.PROS1 . INEXPENSIVE.2 . POWERFUL . I have a small yard that I typically mow with an old-fashioned , manual push mower . Oftentimes I will go over the yard with a trimmer before I use the push mower to handle thick and weedy patches . This trimmer does a great job in that respect.CONS1 . LINE WO N'T FEED . I have to take the line housing apart at least 3 times every single time I trim . And my yard is not large ! This is infinitely frustrating and renders this trimmer almost unusable for anything but the smallest of projects.2 . EDGING IS HORRIBLE . First off , trying to edge just chews the line to pieces ... resulting in repeated problems with CON # 1 . In addition , I can never seem to get a nice , straight edge despite following the instructions in the manual . Just ca n't do it.3 . HEAVY . This thing weighs a LOT for an electric trimmer . Wow . The weight makes it somewhat difficult to control . ( I 've also used a trimmer that was too light , and equally difficult to control . So there 's obviously a sweet spot . And it 's not being met here . )	-1
Look , I 've used a lot of electric string trimmers over the years , but I received this product because I 'm an Amazon Vine member , and there was no cost to me . Cheap is dear ( I spent a fair amount of time trying to get this trimmer to work , and my time is not `` free '' ) ! First of all , this 14 '' trimmer is fairly easy to assemble , and it looks nice , but that 's where the positive comments end.The motor is only 5.5 amps and my Black & Decker GrassHog ( model GH2000 ) has a 7.2 amp motor , and the difference is amazing.This Remington product is also quieter than the B & D ; trimmer , but that 's really not an important statistic , because an ineffective trimmer that 's quiet , is still useless . This Remington trimmer also has a double nylon line , but the `` automatic '' line advance simply does n't work at all . I turned the power switch on and off many times , but the lines never advanced at all , so the trimmer was basically useless ! I notice that another reviewer said the same thing about the `` EZ line advance '' , and that reviewer was correct.The only electric trimmer that I 've found to be really effective is the Black & Decker Grasshog 2000 , and this Remington model does n't hold a candle to it . If a string trimmer ca n't automatically lengthen its line ( s ) , then it 's useless , and that 's the case with this Remington trimmer . Plus the nylon line diameter appears to be less than that on the Black & Decker GH2000 , so the combination of a lighter motor , a lighter/thinner line , and an automatic line lengthener that does n't work , makes for a product that 's ineffective and not worth buying.By the way , as another reviewer has also said , the `` length '' adjustment on the handle does n't extend to a long enough length for me , and I 'm also 5 ' 11 '' . I 'm giving this product two stars instead of one , just because I ca n't believe that all of these Remington trimmers have a line advance that does n't work at all . It 's possible ( but not likely ) that I got a bad trimmer .	-1
I am a big fan of electric outdoor lawn equipment . I have corded and cordless lawnmowers , trimmers , edgers , blowers , etc , from major brands such as Black and Decker and Greenworks . I regularly mow my lawn with a Greenworks 25022 lawn mower and trim it with a Black and Decker plug-in string trimmer . I have never owned a Remington trimmer , but I thought I would give it a try.On removal from the box , I was impressed at the ease of assembly . No need to break out a screwdriver - the nylon cutting line is pre-wound and installed , and the plastic guard snaps on with ease . The handle is tightened down with a simple knob . As I picked up the trimmer and went outside to try it , I noticed the first strike against the trimmer . It is heavy . At 9 lbs , it is literally 2x the weight of the comparable corded string trimmers from Black and Decker . Unlike some tools , extra weight does NOT help with a string trimmer . It makes it a pain to use.I plugged in the trimmer which was easy thanks to the plug pig-tail , a nice feature over the plug moulded-into-plastic which B & D ; uses . The pig-tail means you can get a good attachment to a cord and it is less likely to fall out . I trimmed my grass with ease , and then flipped it over to try some edging . Once again , the 9 # of weight make this a bit awkward , but I persevered . There is a nice wheel on the front for making this easier - my B & D ; has no such wheel , but then again , it is lighter so the wheel is less necessary.Of course , edging against a sidewalk will wear down the line , and I quickly found myself with a shorter and shorter line . Unfortunately , the sophisticated & # 34 ; auto-feed & # 34 ; system did absolutely nothing . I flipped over trimmer , tried my best to manually feed some line ( not easy when it 's an auto-feeder & # 34 ; ) , but when it ran short again , it still refused to feed more line.It 's not really for me to debug - every other trimmer I have owned just works . This is a $ 40 trimmer that does not work so I can not recommend it .	-1
Thanks , Remington , for one of the most frustrating experiences in recorded memory ! We wasted most of Saturday trying to edge areas around the patio , driveway , etc . that would 've taken no time for a good trimmer.The best experience with the Remington was that it was easy to assemble . Everything went south from there . I tried to use it myself , knowing the weight of it would get to me after a while . I did n't have that problem for long , because the line feed just refused to work . Two feet of trimming , then pffttt , line has to be manually pushed . Again . And again.My husband took over , and had the same problem . After two hours of this pain , we got out the old trimmer and finished the job in an hour - patience only gets you so far when the sun starts setting ! I did n't want to finish edging the lawn by lantern light ! The Remington trimmer clearly is powerful , hence two stars , but with an impossible to manage line feed that just does n't work , I 'd make a clear pass around this model .	-1
Pros - smoking multi-cooker , reaches 15psi ( ? ) Cons - quality control & support problemsI got very interested in this product after I saw all the informative reviews of it ( especially photos & review by K Swede & review by E Swope ) . Not only is it a multi-cooker ( like the much cheaper Nesco and Fagor ) , it also can hot or cold smoke ! Since I have a storage problem , having one unit that can pressure cook , slow cook , steam , and smoke seemed like a great idea for those times I want automated cooking . Even though it seemed overpriced for what it did , I decided to treat myself and ordered one.Unfortunately , when mine arrived , while trying to start the test drive recommended in Miss Vicky 's book , it became obvious that the cooking mode lights could not be seen , thus there was no way to know what cooking modes are selected . So I had to return it ( thank you Amazon customer service ! ) . But before doing so , I noticed a number of additional concerns : First , this mode light problem seems like this item was not even tested before shipping it from the factory , which makes me wonder what other problems could pop up with this model . This basic unit seems well made , with quality machining and heavy gauge materials of the cooker & insert ( but a very spindly rack ) , so to have this quality-control gotcha was quite a disappointment . ( Also the lifetime of nonstick is always a problem , stainless steel might be better . ) Secondly , there are other concerns about who stands behind this product . The support website mentioned in the printed instructions ( buygourmetgenie ) is not working at this moment . Google finds a link to a pdf of the instructions , but that yields a 404 not found error ( as of this writing ) , with no cached version available on google . And , the vendor who is selling it on Amazon seems to be a tv vendor who has mostly garden items on the emsco site ( and they did not have any cooking equipment on their site at all ) . [ ETA - an email address was given for assistance at `` emsonusa '' in a comment to this review , so check it out if you need this information . Looking into `` emsonusa '' led to `` emsontv '' which does have other items for sale , including some cooking items , but not this pressure-smoker , as of this writing - 11/10/2011 ] The printed instructions themselves are sort of sketchy . Nesco has much more complete instructions for their comparable non-smoking multi-cooker ( pdf available online ) . [ ETA - a link to a pdf of the instructions can be found on the most excellent hippressurecooking site - 4/14/13 ] Finally , I noticed other cooking problems when doing the test drive . There was no obvious way to tell at what point full pressure was reached , and it started counting down at `` Start '' , instead of once full pressure was apparently reached . ( On the very similar Nesco pressure cooker which I subsequently purchased , the timer starts counting down after pressure is reached -- this could make a significant difference in cooking results . ) Also , because the charring element protrudes into the cooking pot , it might be annoying to try to stir something being cooked more conventionally - ymmv . ( Maybe I should eschew automation and just pan smoke the way I used to , simply by elevating the food on a trivet and putting the chips at the very bottom of a dutch oven ) .It is hard to know how to rate something so promising yet with these problems . I 'm going to go for three stars , decremented by one for having received a non-usable unit . Hence two stars overall.By the way , it looks like the factory that makes this item also makes the Nesco and Fagor multi-cookers . Numerous internal details are the same , like the way the lids interlock with the pot , and the identical condensation collectors , bottom heating plate with temperature sensor , regulator shield , etc.A comment regarding target cooking pressures : although 15psi is standard for pressure cooker recipes , many of the electronic models supposedly do not reach at 15psi ( including the Cuisinart , which supposedly cooks at 9psi when on high ) . However , the CookingIssues blog found that 15psi made a big difference in taste tests . The Nesco and this Emson supposedly reach 15psi , but I am not sure how I would actually verify that .	-1
I did n't use this very much over the year ( about 8-10 hours a day for about 3-4 months ) , and it died . It had a burn mark on one of the slots the glass tube enters , so something probably blew inside the base of it . I thought I remembered seeing it slowly turning brown at the base over time.I bought the 85 watt bulb from here that looks similar to this one , and have been using it the same amount of time and it has n't died or shown any signs of burning . I would recommend that one over this one , it 's worth the few extra dollars .	-1
Seems like a quality product but I had problems with it . Maybe there was too much suction , but there were 2 areas on this hose that got kinks in it . I would have to squeeze the hose in the opposite direction to get the kinks out , but they would just develop again after several minutes . I used it twice before returning it .	-1
I shopped for months , looking for the perfect outdoor furniture but the ones I liked were so expensive , until I came across this one . After reading some horrible reviews . I decided to take my chances with caution . So I started by ordering the ottoman first because it is a smaller item . ( See my review of the ottoman ) . After that , I ordered the chair and side table ( also see my reviews on both items ) .I then took the big leap and ordered the sofa . It arrived in a timely manner . The delivery man was not friendly at all.After he dropped off the very large box . I struggled to open it and pulled out the sofa . I immediately noticed a huge damage to the lower back of the sofa . The back rod that runs across the sofa , which provides supports for the three rear legs was severely bent inward causing the wicker to fold up and also lifting the legs off the ground . I taught it must have been damaged from transit because the box was slightly damaged and I could not believe that a company will knowingly package an obviously damaged furniture and have it shipped out.I immediately called Amazon customer service . The rep was professional and helpful . She arranged for an exchange for another sofa and she told me that the delivery company will pick up the damaged sofa when the deliver the new one ( by the way , that information was incorrect ) When they called to schedule a delivery of the new one , they told me that they do not pick up.So I had to call Amazon again , and this time the rep told me that he would contact the company that does the pickup to make the arrangement.Eight days later , I received the replacement , but the damaged sofa and the large box it came in were still sitting in my living room because they had not been picked up.However this time around the second sofa delivery man was very pleasant and professional . He agreed to help me unpack the sofa and inspect it . We both found the same damage on the same spot as the previously delivered sofa . Although the second sofa was not as damaged as the first one . It was still noticeable and the center rear leg was elevated off the floor.I immediately called Amazon again . The rep was professional . He issued a refund plus additional Amazon credit for the inconvenience . He also mentioned that they have had several complaints about the sofa and that they may stop the sells until the manufacturer resolves the issues . The call was disconnected , so I called back to finalize the call . This time a different rep took my call . She was professional as well . She finalized the return.So I asked her if I could keep the second sofa with less damage for a discount because they may temporary stop sales of the sofa and I really do n't want to shop for another sofa , It is really time consuming . She told me that they could only give me eight five dollars discount.I said No , thanks . If I am going to keep a damage sofa and save them the return shipping for a sofa that they can not resale . The least they can do is fifty to seventy percent off.So with that said , I plan to sit both sofa outside for them to be picked up . There is no room in my house for two large damage sofas and a very large box.Overall , the design of the sofa is nice , it looks just as pictured . The cushions are not very comfortable , they may get more comfortable as they age . It is reasonably prized . Customer service is pretty good.It is an ok sofa if you receive one that 's not broken.Good luck , shop at your own risk ; )	-1
I believe a table should have a solid top . This one does not . The manufacturer did put a slim ( about 1/16 '' thick ) piece of hard and brittle plastic on the underside of the weave . My table arrived with a 6 '' jagged crack in that plastic . I do not see that the plastic adds to the support of the table top . My 5.5 pound cat walked across the table and created an indent with each step she took.If there were stemmed wine glasses on the table and someone put their hand down and leaned on the table the wine glasses would take a tumble.Besides the unstable table top : The weave is not always straight with the edges on all sides . The color of the fake rattan does accurately match the other pieces in this line ( at least the one other piece that I have ) . The feet are brown-paint-coated aluminum and are anchored well . The packaging has been improved ( since the piece I received last month ) , in that the spots in the box where the feet hit are reinforced . The table arrived in good shape because it was packed properly , so do n't be afraid about the shipping of this item.UPDATE May 4 , 2012 : Found a good use for this piece of furniture : It is very useful for hiding things . It is so light weight , just lift it up and store unsightly , but necessary patio/outdoor/pool stuff underneath . We took a lid from a plastic tub and set our bug sprays , glass cleaner , plant food , etc . on the lid , then put the `` table '' over it . If this piece of furniture had a sturdy top and a lid , I 'd give it five stars ... .	-1
The cats in my neighborhood love this stuff . I just sprinkle it on the ground , they show up and lay beside it , roll in it , sniff it . Basically this is granulated catnip.Unfortunately I want to get rid of cats , not get more of them .	-1
Well , the squirrel ate more of the garage door after Dad put these around the area . He said they smelled bad enough , but did n't work . : ( So , he put a phony woodpecker out there , and is waiting for the results of that , but said that the plastic bird worked quite well in the back of the house . : )	-1
I bought this product to deter squirrels from moving into my attic . We 're used to having one or two over-winter up there but this year there were at least six ( I shot 5 of them and one keeps coming around ) . They were really rambunctious and gnawed away at the woodwork in the attic.I made up little sachets of the Fox Urine Granules using paper towels . The squirrels found them offensive but just threw them out under the eaves of the roof . They were n't scared by the scent at all . I might try using the granules to scare off the rabbits if they bother my garden but , so far , the product has n't worked for me .	-1
I bought this since it 's compatible with other B & D products that use the same battery . It does n't blow hard enough though , and only has 1 fan speed . The battery also barely last long enough to 15 minutes of blowing . I will say it 's nice and quiet compared to other electric and gas blowers I 've used .	-1
It worked so well for about six months but unfortunately as many others have already reported there is a definite battery issue . Black & Decker confirms there was a large batch of faulty batteries ( LBXR36 ) that got released . I purchased this from Amazon and they were the seller of this product . However , even Amazon will no longer sell , warranty or even discuss this poor product . I 'm trying now ( with little success so far ) to get Black & Decker to honor the supposed 3 yr. warranty on this battery , but so far I 've been treated with little more than an honorable ignorance . If I do n't hear from them soon this will sadly be my last Black & Decker product . I would avoid this product folks .	-1
The best part of this unit is the battery . I have lots of curved areas , stone walls , walkways and more which require use of a string trimmer - the battery lasts long enough to get through all of it , and not needing to move an electric cord around has dramatically reduced the time I spend doing the work.However , the unit itself is poorly designed and unwieldy . I wish I never bought it.The & # 34 ; auto feed & # 34 ; does not work , period . Previous ( corded ) units allowed me to gently hover above the grass or rest the spinning piece on the ground to cut all grass an even height . Not this unit . The options seem to be either 1 . Hover and cut nothing , or , 2 . Cut everything down to the soil level.Moving along the ground the guard frequently catches and sends the spinning string toward the ground , hacking bald spots into the lawn.There must be other , better units out there . Avoid this one .	-1
EDIT 6/5/2013 : The trap finally caught something ... Our cat ! It never did catch a skunk , and the cat called me some pretty nasty names when I released it.This is fairly easy to set , but it does n't catch the skunks that are running roughshod over my property and stealing my cat 's food ( and occasionally spraying the cats ) . The first night , the little buggers tripped the trap , but did n't get caught . Since then , they have figured out how to take the bait without even tripping the trap -- and they 've done it twice ! I did give it two stars because it really is quite easy to set up . Maybe your skunks ( or other critters ) have n't taken lessons from Houdini , like mine did , but this trap did n't work for mine . : - ( Back to the drawing board . I hope I can find something that works !	-1
... in a perfect world , I would n't need *any* mouse trap . They could live in their habitat , and me in mine , and we would n't have a problem.But the world is not a perfect place , and my house goes through cycles ( especially as the fall and winter approach ) when the local mice decide that my natural habitat can be shared by them . If they did no damage with chewing ( especially chewing stuff I like -- like the insulation around the engine in my car ! -- ) and if they were guaranteed disease free , we might be able to compromise . But their chewing is destructive and their droppings are at best icky and worst can carry disease , leaving cohabitation as an unavailable option . In addition to the efforts of an energetic cat , we also turn to traps when the evidence of mice appear.We 've tried many mouse trap variants , and approached the Nooski with an open mind . In the end , its faults outweigh its utility : -Price ( including consumable `` replacement rings '' : The Nooski is expensive ( in the domain of mouse traps , anyway ) , and the kill device is a small rubber ring that snaps off the trap body and onto the mouse 's neck . Replacement packs of 10 cost about half as much as the trap . You 'll have to do your own math on whether or not this is the right choice for you ( it 's not for me ) .-Difficult arming : this is a two-handed job ( and if your are mobility limited , especially regarding fingers or thumbs : forget about it ) . And arming failures send the kill ring flying ... sometimes out of sight.-Death throes : The kill ring strangles the mouse , but does not restrain them . They can wander some distance while fighting off the end , and you HOPE they finally expire in a place where you can see them.-And yeah , then you 're going to have to pick up the deceased.All traps no doubt introduce pain and suffering on their victims . The question becomes how much , for how long , and what 's left for the trap user to deal with afterwards . Because of flaws in each of these areas , the Nooski is n't the trap for me .	-1
I liked that this was going to be somewhat a reusable trap - the product comes with ten rings . It does n't use poison which is great because the birds and cats are n't poisoned by the poisoned mice.However , after reading others ' reviews and abot how it 's not as painless as it seems , I did n't have the heart to use the this product . Imagining the pain the mice would go through , I could n't do it . Vermin they may be , but I 'm a bleeding heart when it comes to animals .	-1
I was excited to try this out because about a month ago we had a mice problem in our house . I used the Nooski in an area that the mice seemed to love and I also had two snap traps down . I ended up catching 5 mice with the snap traps and none with the Nooski , all using the same bait . We may have also had a misfire once , we 're not sure if it was a mouse or something we did.One positive about the Nooski is that it is supposed to be safe for your pets . That 's one thing that concerns me with the snap traps and I have to make sure I put them only in places the pets ca n't get to.I wish this would have worked but we just did n't have any luck with it . The snap traps remain the most effective for us .	-1
I received this yesterday . While waiting for it to arrive , I read other reviews on it so was curious to find out what my own experience would be . I wasted no time setting it.The device consists of a clear plastic tube nestled into a black plastic tray . The first step on the instructions said to remove the clear tube from the black plastic tray and put bait in the bait tray . I could not make head nor tail of their diagram to figure out exactly where I was supposed to put the bait , but took a guess and shoved a little peanut butter in . Next I loaded the ring , which actually was much easier than I had anticipated based on reviews . The next step said to hold the lever with my thumb while inserting it back into the black plastic tray . The problem is it is not that easy to get it back in . I had had some difficulty getting it out in the first place and now I could n't figure out how to get it back in . While trying , my thumb released the trigger and the ring flew off . Now my hands were slightly greasy from the peanut butter and getting the ring back on was next to impossible . I tried drying everything off with a towel and eventually with the help of the towel , was able to thread the ring back on . In the middle of all this , I realized I had guessed wrong about where to put the bait . So now I had to clear the peanut butter out of where I had put it , and move it to the new location ( again - a better diagram , or marking ON the plastic where to put the bait , would be enormously helpful ) . I again tried to set the clear plastic tube into the tray while holding the trigger with my thumb . I almost had it in when it triggered again , planting the ring on my index finger . On the plus side , there was no discomfort . On the minus side , I had to reset the ring a third time . Finally on the third try , I got the ring to stay on AND got the clear tube set into the black tray . FINALLY ( 20 minutes and a lot of frustration after starting ) the thing was set and ready to catch mice.I 've had a mouse problem in my chicken coop , and the trail of mouse poop indicates where they spend a lot of time . So I set the trap up against a wall , on the floor , in the middle of one of their paths . I was mildly disappointed when locking up the chickens for the night last night to find that it had not yet killed a mouse . But I figured they are probably more active by night than by day so by morning it would have done the job . Not so - by this morning the thing is still sitting there triggered and ready to go - no dead mice anywhere.So needless to say , my experience with this mouse trap has not been one that would allow me to recommend it . While working on it , another thought occurred to me which is that it can only kill one at a time before needing to be reset . Prior to ordering this , I had been looking at a Victor trap that can hold up to 30 . A friend ( who also needed a trap for her chicken coop ) ordered the Victor trap and reported catching 16 the first night , 13 the second and 15 the third . And she does n't have to reorder any parts to get it to keep catching mice . When I compare that to the single mouse this trap could kill IF it did it at all ... ..the choice is easy.Off to order the Victor trap ... ..Update : After sitting in the chicken coop for 8 days , the trap finally killed a mouse . As a matter of interest , I tried removing the ring from the dead mouse and although it is tight and therefore not easy , it is doable . I was able to reuse the ring to reset the trap , and feed the mouse to the chickens . The next morning there was another dead mouse , and I was able to repeat . It seems that now they are used to the trap sitting there , it is starting to be effective . I also thought others might be interested to know it *is* possible to reuse the rings , with a little bit of work .	-1
Number one , I do n't like how in humane this is . Since the mouse ran across the entire room , 14 feet , after it got the ring on it 's neck it was obvious it did not die instantly and then I still had to pick it up to throw away so nasty that way too . The whole thing is also too expensive if you have a lot of mice . I still say the old wood trap is just as good and cheaper than anything else out there and you can reuse it over and over . I just pick the end of the trap up with that so I do n't need to touch the dead mouse to open it and drop it in the garbage . Much more sanitary . Also , I had a hard time getting this crazy thing put together with the ring on after the one that came already installed was used . Anyone with big hands and fingers , or weak hands and fingers , will find it almost impossible to get it set again . Just go buy the old wood traps , they never let you down and are cheap and seem to never wear out . I have one that is about 30 years old and works as well now as the day I bought it and ... . I never need to buy anything extra to make it work . They may try to make it look like it is hard to use but that 's just negative advertising . Like anything else , once you 've set it a few times it 's a breeze .	-1
I dislike leaving a negative review if I 'm not 100 % sure its not my fault but here goes . We live in a completely wooded area and with fall here the mice are moving into our pole barn and garage . We keep 4-5 traps out at all times , currently Victor Quick Set or Tomcat `` jaw '' traps . Decided to try these.Set-up took a little while , when doing it the first time it takes a while to figure out and even then the ring or `` noose '' keeps flying off , took me five tries the first time . Be careful opening the package or the rings will fall all over the place . When setting these on the floor the first thing I noticed is they have to be parrallel to the wall ( no way it can work if the ring side is facing a wall ) which means the mouse has to come from one side for the trap to work , unlike a jaws trap where the mouse can come from right or left.After being out a while we found the ring gone , droppings on the peanut butter bait but no mouse , happened twice . A search of the area found no mice , so do n't know if the mice were not trapped or crawled away to die.While the design is different it seems to have problems . Hard to set-up , needs replacement rings ( 20 rings for $ 7.99 or 39 cents a ring , to be fair the Victor Quick Set trap mechanism seems to break often ) and the mouse is not trapped but can wander off it seems like . My wife hates the idea of the mouse not being attached to the trap and just laying somewhere and we need gloves or whatever to pick it up versus a jaw trap where you just open the jaws and it drops out . Finally , it may sound dumb , but snap traps do seem more humane and kill quick and clean , usually , instead of strangling the mouse to death .	-1
I 've had this outside in a highly travelled mouse highway for about a month and a half already , and we have n't caught one mouse with it . Meanwhile , one standard trap 2 feet away and another standard trap 2 feet away in the other direction have both given me kills , repeatedly .	-1
I live on a farm in the middle of fields . During winter , mice invade our barn and basement looking for food and warmth . So I know a thing or two about mouse traps . I buy a lot of them . In fact , I buy them by the case . I was interested in trying a new one.Being new is the only thing the Nooski mouse trap has going for it . It 's miserable to set , not terribly effective , and when it works it 's inhumane . First you have to set the trap . This involves rolling a very tight rubber ring around the trap . That 's a pain and I ended up needing my son 's help . We tried tripping the trap and it tripped one time out of three attempts . We placed the trap in a high mouse traffic zone . It was located by plain old sticky boards . The first two nights all the sticky boards had a mouse but not the nooski . The third night , the nooski caught a mouse . Kind of . It actually ended up not around his neck but kind of around his head . He made it a good distance . We only found him because of the bright green ring . I really hate mice and I will kill them to keep them out of my grain , chicken coops , and especially house . But there is no way I can justify doing that to an animal . I 'll stick with using One Bite and sticky boards .	-1
As you probably are aware by now , the idea of this mousetrap is to snap a rubber band around the neck of the mouse , to strangle it or perhaps break its neck . Either way , you end up with a mouse on the floor with a thick rubber band around its neck . And if you have a dog or a cat , they 're more than likely going to eat the mouse AND the rubber band . This is not something I want to risk.Another bad idea for us ( good for the company ) is that you would have to keep buying more rubber bands to keep using the trap . It 's not like so many other traps that are simply reusable.Sorry , not only ca n't I recommend it , I recommend against it .	-1
It took forever to set this trap , to get the little rubber ring onto the trap was certainly a trick . I could n't do it I had to find someone with more agile fingers than I have . I checked it a few days later and the rubber ring was gone and no mouse in sight . I set the trap again , a few days later the same , rubber ring is gone but no mouse . These little rubber rings are expensive and you have to man handle the trap to get them on it anyway . I assume the mice are dead but I really do n't know because I never found a body . I 'll jus go back to the snap spring trap , I know it works because there is a dead mouse to prove it .	-1
Nooski 300000798 Mouse Trap With 10 Rings . This mouse trap was easy to get out of the package and it took a little time to set it up . You have to make sure the ring is all the way on or it will snap off and you start again . It is a bit hard to push the ring on . The peanut butter was the easiest part to put on . Then we placed it in our motor home , the next morning the trap was sprung , the peanut butter was gone and so was the ring but we could not find a mouse anywhere . Then for the next three mornings the trap was sprung , the peanut butter was gone but the green ring was laying by the trap and no mouse . The fourth time the ring was gone and no mouse to be found . There were mice dropping inside the tube but no dead mice .	-1
Interesting concept , design and execution on this `` Nooski 300000798 Mouse Trap With 10 Rings . `` Once one gets the hang of setting trap , it does work , but we have to give this one an overall `` thumbs down '' because the very premise ... death by strangulation ... is a faulty one . Why ? 1 ) It 's less humane than an instant death by broken neck ( and while the cheaper-by-the-dozen wooden-spring traps may lead to some `` poorly-executed '' executions , there are some very good , strong traps available that can be counted on to provide a much more humane kill ( for example , theSnap-E Mouse Trap by Kness ) .2 ) Some mice ( like the last one we caught ) can endure more than others , and can travel to other locations before they actually succumb ... not fair to the mouse , and a ticking time bomb of stinking death to the homeowner.3 ) Even if the user is OK with this asphyxiation method ... there is the need to buy more razor blades ( errr ... nooses ) ... while a spring trap just keeps on giving ( or taking away ... depending on your perspective ) .The only practical uses for this system would be either outdoors ( and why go after mice outdoors ... that 's where they belong ) ... or in an enclosed area like a drawer that they can squeeze into when they are healthy ( but that 's entrapment ) ... and still , the death may be painfully slow.This is one of those products that someone thought about too much , in our humble estimation . Better than a glue trap ( but those should be against the law anyway ... they are dangerous to crawling babies & small pets ) . Spring traps ( well-built ) are better . And a cat is even better ... adopt one today and solve your problems and provide a home at the same time ; - )	-1
I really wanted this thing to work . I wanted to see tight little green necklaces around trespassing mice . But I 'm sorry , this thing was in continuous use for over a month , and it did n't do a thing.Yeah , we still got mice . Little vermin in the attic , under the deck , and in the garage . They 're cute , actually , and I do n't really want to kill a living that 's doing nothing but what a few million years of evolution has wired it to do to survive -- he 's just being a mouse , after all -- but they 're not welcome in my house and I do n't want them around . We 've been using glue traps , and they 've done okay , catching about one a week in the attic , but not so great for the garage , where there 's a lot of dust , and other critters ; I accidentally snagged two blue-tailed skinks and a snake this summer . While I managed to free the snake , both skinks did n't make it , and I still feel bad about that.I like the packaging of this contraption , first of all easy to get into , and not a major garden tool operation to get through the plastic and get the product out and into action -- thank you.It 's a one-piece thing , that pulls apart into two pieces , the black tunnel ( is n't that a thrash metal club in Berlin ? ) and the semi-clear housing . The instructions are okay , but Step 1 says simply `` separate the clear tube and the black tunnel . '' There are no instructions on how this is done , nor is there a diagram or anything helpful stamped into the plastic pieces . There are no mechanical parts , but it still took me a few minutes to discern the nature of the trap and its construction , and figure out how to get these two pieces separated without just yanking and likely breaking something . Some improved text and diagramming would help with this specific action.The trap 's action centers on the green ring , which closes tight around Mickey 's neck and chokes him right out . The packaging notes that the critter dies outside the trap , which makes it nicer for dealing with the trap , resetting it , etc . There 's nothing holding the mouse inside , no mechanical engagement that does him in , no blood . I like the secondary effect of the mouse lying dead next to the trap , the classic fascist warning to all the others.The packaging says there 's no mess , and that 's fairly accurate , no squashed or perforated mouse with fluids spewed out . But you 've still got ta pick the sucker up and get him into the trash can . That 's gloves , tongs , or some other implement . If you 're a total miser I guess you could re-use the green ring , but that would necessitate some pretty intense interaction with the mouse carcass -- really not worth it . Yes , Amazon.com does sell the extra green rings , but I note that they were not for sale at my local independent hardware store , nor did I see them at the closest Lowe's.Even if the sucker misfires/fires prematurely , and it did not for me , there 's no snap , no threat to your fingers or anything else . All you have to do is pull the two parts apart , re-roll the green ring back into place , and put the trap back in place , a few seconds of nuisance , but no threat to your digits . That 's an improvement.But did it work ? Well , I put it into action in the garage immediately on receipt , 25 September . I baited it with peanut butter ( Jiffy , smooth ) , and nothing . I changed the bait after a week to some crumbled dog chow , which the mice keep coming back for -- nothing . I changed the bait after another week to dog jerky treats -- nothing . I changed the bait after another week to breakfast cereal -- nothing , again . So , after a full month of attempted use , and with four separate types of bait , I had no dead mice to show . In this time a glue trap all of three feet away has caught one mouse.Bottom line : It 's been a month since I received this product , and it 's been in continuous use since , per the instructions , in a garage where mice are present . In that time this trap has killed no mice . That 's not a good mousetrap . I rate it at two stars rather than one for the innovative design .	-1
I 'm not sure I see how strangling the mouse is anymore humane than breaking their neck . The worst part of dealing with any trap is the disposal of the dead carcass and that is still necessary with this `` high tech '' trap . I used it in the garage and since they seem to come and go at will I think I 'll stick with the poisons that supposedly drive them outside to die and then I wo n't have to remove them plus it will kill multitudes of them rather than just however many rings you have and how many times you are there to keep resetting the trap . Maybe in the house where you might only have one mouse and you definitely want to visually see that you got him this would be the way to go . Although I had trouble setting it I think I would get better at it after repeated settings .	-1
**UPDATE November 2013**After over a year , still have n't caught anything with this , though the snap traps have caught at least five mice during the same period . I 've tried this trap on it 's own , and it seems that the mice I have are too timid or too smart ... Summary - Mouse trap that wo n't catch your fingers and is hard to trip accidentally . Instructions are not great and do require some finger strength - I 'd suggest that some people will have a hard time with setting the trap.Fascinating design - when the mouse sticks it 's head into the bait area an industrial strength rubber band clamps to it 's neck.Right from the start I had a hard time separating the clear part from the black base . I did n't want to force it and the arrows seemed to clearly indicate the direction to remove . Finally I got it off , so I was then able to load the bait and the rubber band.I always keep a few mouse traps in the garage since the occasional mouse wanders in to eat my grass seed and birdseed . The problem is that at least once a week I use a leaf blower to sweep ( I do woodworking so there 's sawdust , etc ) The conventional `` Snap traps '' often get bumped and then I have to remember to re-set.This trap seems quite robust , so far , to being jostled . I have n't actually caught any mice yet with it but it 's survived three leaf blower relocations.I do wish they used a brighter green for the rubber band - it can be hard to see if it 's been tripped or not.I will update this review as appropriate .	-1
~~~~~~Update Apr 30 , 2012~~~~~~I followed the suggestion on the comments by Mr. Dang and others : shortened the handle , adjusted my grass height from 4 '' to a shorter 3 '' , and 'floated ' the mower . Unfortunately , this did not fix enough of my issues . It was still difficult for me to push , although I did lose traction less often . I invited my neighbor over to try it out and she had a great deal of trouble pushing it . She said it would take `` Hercules '' to mow a lawn . Her husband came by and said that you had to have a lot of upper body strength to push it . This mower would be good for younger ladies , but not middle aged women.Sorry to all the people who are clearly disappointed with my experience using this lawnmower . I realize you had a `` 5 star '' experience , unfortunately I did not.April 27 , 2012As a woman , I have trouble mowing our lawn with our giant gas-powered Honda mower . I can rarely even start it , and do n't want to mow with it because it 's so powerful and I can barely control it . Because I 'd like to be able to mow my own lawn , I got the Fiskars mower.I put together the Fiskars 17 '' StaySharp Push Mower very quickly . The small booklet has 2 double pages of clear and simple instructions . It took me one tool ( a wrench ) , and about 30 minutes . It would have been quicker , but I was also watching the morning news while I was assembing the mower . Basically , you just put pieces of the handle together , screw on back wheels , and cotter pin the handle to the blade-part . Adjusting the mower height is really easy too . This is an important feature because one should never `` scalp '' a lawn . Scalping ( cutting off more than half of your grass ' height ) allows weeds to over run your lawn , and basically hurts your grass ' ability to look gorgeous.Now comes the hard part : mowing the lawn . One design flaw is that the handle is made to move forward , probably for upright storage . This makes pushing the mower more difficult because I lost my mower-pushing traction when I 'd have to push hard and the handle would fly forward . Every time it did that , I 'd have to start all over again with my push from a full stop . What a waste of human energy . It made it way harder to mow and I ended up using my waist to help me push -- yes , totally awkward . My wrists also hurt after mowing . I 'm 5'6 '' , it would be even more awkward for someone shorter.The grass clippings are moved in front of the mower , not behind you like a regular mower . So if you get a clump of grass , you 've got to mow it twice . Also , it leaves unsightly grass clumps on the sidewalk since it throws the clippings forward.Also , the edges of your lawn will have `` fringe '' where it meets any cement . The overall look that I was left with would be best described as `` clumsy '' . Besides the fringe perimeter , I was also left with other long grass because of the limited reach of this mower . I wanted to pull out my gas mower immediately and fix the clumsy cut of the Fiskars.Pros : * Easy assembly* Relatively light , as mowers go* Nearly silent , much appreciated quietCons : * Difficult to get traction because of mower handle* Have to mow with waist to regain lost traction* Grass clippings deposited in FRONT of mower* Leaves unsightly fringe around yard perimeters* Challenging on any incline at all , even low ones* Makes me want to pull out gas mower and redo terrible cut because Fiskars mow looks awful* Off-gassing from smelly plasticI do n't recommend buying this if you care about how your lawn looks .	-1
I purchased 3 different timers from 3 different manufacturers . This one was a tad bit more difficult to get lined up on the spigot correctly , but once in place , worked as advertised.UPDATE -- We had a hard sudden freeze . The other 2 timers came through fine . In fact , they stayed on the spigots all winter . This one cracked and spewed 100+ gallons of water before it was caught . Would not purchase if there is any chance of a hard freeze before you can remove the unit . I live in the Sacramento Valley , so my idea of a hard freeze is about 28 degrees .	-1
Orbit screwed up simple technology by adding a & # 34 ; trigger & # 34 ; to reset . It is not intuitive for me . Sometimes , after resetting to Off , I found that it began to run . Not good . I threw these away .	-1
I live out in the country and mice are a constant problem . I know there are mice where I put this trap because I can see what they 've left behind . However , I 've caught very few mice in the trap . Most reviews for the Tomcat Multiple Catch Mouse Trap are quite positive , so I ca n't explain why I 'm not getting the same good results . I 've followed the instructions on the package clearly , yet still have marginal results , but I 'm disappointed .	-1
great idea and great concept of a mouse catcher of that does not kill the mice but rather not sure . Unfortunately we have not been able to catch any mice in it yet .	-1
We 've had this mouse trap in a problem mouse area at our front entryway for several weeks now . We know there are mice because because we see droppings -- lots of them . So I knew the optimal location to place this mouse trap . Our hope was that we 'd catch the little pests and then be able to safely and humanely release them in an empty field far from home.We followed the directions to a T. Setting the trap is n't difficult , though the directions call for precision when winding up the mechanism that is supposed to usher mice in . Unfortunately , we have quite a bit of evidence that mice have been around the trap . There are droppings around it and even on it . But nary a mouse has been caught . This is supposed to be a bait free trap , and we followed directions and did n't use any bait . As the mouse problem is in a location that does n't actually have a food source , we do n't want to add one . Likewise , we do n't want to exacerbate our problem by attracting ants , so this baitless trap is completely ineffective at our house .	-1
I live in hanta virus country , so the idea of catch and release mouse traps did n't appeal too much , but I figured I could catch them and feed them to my dogs and chickens ( yes , I 'm a bad person , but my Great Pyrs and 70 chickens love fresh meat , what can I say ? ) .This trap has been sitting in our mud room , a notoriously 'mousy ' area for at least 2 weeks -- NOTHING . Either it 's too difficult for them to get into , or they get in and get out , or they 're not interested in getting in . Whatever . The bottom line is that this is just useless .	-1
Living in a rural area , I often get mice indoors and even in our cars . The standard snap traps with peanut butter are reliable and effective , but I liked the idea of being able to `` relocate '' mice and especially being able to catch multiple mice behind a clear window.This can be wound up to catch multiple mice , but you have to tap it ( and hear a click ) to ensure it is set . It would be nice if there were a visual indication that it was fully wound.I was hoping that this would put an end to the adage , `` the early bird gets the worm , but the late mouse gets the cheese . '' Unfortunately , our mice do n't seem to be interested in going into this thing even with peanut butter in it.The single mouse we caught was when my daughter chased one of the mice in the barn into it and blocked its exits.Perhaps this would work with city mice , but country mice just do n't want to enter this hotel .	-1
Pros : ReusableNo danger to pets or kids if you bait with nontoxic food.Cons : Winding gizmo is touchy.If two mice end up in it , the results can be gruesome . I really don & # 8217 ; t want to be checking the trap all the time to avoid having to look at the corpses of dueling mice . This also makes the claim that it can catch 10 mice at a time dubious . I think it is more humane to just kill them instantly . If you use this trap you have to decide if you want to let them go ( to repopulate ) or kill them yourself somehow.I think I would rather go back to my old fashioned snap traps ( at least I know there will not be any mice gladiator battles ) or my new fangled electrocution chamber ( which also kills instantly ) .	-1
This has a tendency to stall . Tried using it and after about 15 minutes or so , it stopped . Had to wait about 30 minutes before it would turn on again . I do n't like yard work , so this just prolonged the agony . I 've used the Green Machine trimmer and had better , consistent results .	-1
This seems to be a very well constructed piece of equipment . I looked forward to decreasing or at least diminishing the mole population in my back yard . I followed the directions to the best of my ability considering that this Georgia clay is not the softest dirt which the instructions suggest should be used . I had no problem locating an active mole path and installed the trap . When I later checked the trap I could see that the path was wider at the trap indicating that the mole simply bypassed the trap . I moved the trap several more times with the same results . Next , I installed a small metal wall on each side of the trap and waited for positive results . However , the trap remained set and the other end of the mole path became further extended.The moral of the story is that if you have low IQ moles in your yard then you might be able to capture one or more with this trap . However , you can not sell animals short because although you hear the term `` dumb animals '' they are , in fact , not all that dumb . I give this two stars for being well constructed and for having clear and easily followed instructions . I have to deduct three stars because it does not trap any of my moles .	-1
I have a mole problem and have been using the oldVictor 0645 Mole Trap Plunger Styleall metal traps , same as the `` critter getter '' service uses in my area . They work OK , are a little hard to set up and fairly sensitive.I tried this Sweeney plastic one in 3 different places . First , it is easy to set . . . BUT it is n't very sensitive . One place I set it the mole came back through and pushed soil up around the plate . If it had gone off , there would have been one less mole . The second place was at a breathing hole where I had stepped on it and the mole had thrown up a new pile . With the Victor , I would have had a sure kill . With the Sweeney , it did n't go off although I could tell that something had pushed more dirt out.I guess if I had moles that worked out with weights and were very buff the Sweeney would have tripped . I could make it go off with a screwdriver , so it actually was working . I set my Victor traps out the next day in the same places and got a mole . Bought those at least 10 years ago and they still work .	-1
We have a Gazillion Gophers , and hoping this would work ! So far it has not.This is fairly easy to use..Wet the area where the earth has a new hole , or where the gopher has pushed up the earth.Although this has still not worked for me ! ! I 'm going to give this another try with putting some fresh Green veggies leaves into the hole..I have to say this is big , and it is made very well.Gave it 2 stars for that.If this works , I will be back to add on to this review..	-1
This mole trap was very difficult for us to set . Once we got it into position , we struggled to get the catch to hold . It does not want to come all the way out to hold the spring up in place . We have to use a screw driver to cajole the catch into position . So , I do n't agree that this trap is `` incredibly easy to set '' as the box boasts.Once we get it set , it triggers almost immediately . We went through the process many times before calling it quits . With the spikes as sharp as they are and the spring as tight as it is , we decided it was the sensible and safe thing to do : Give up before we got too tired , made a bad move and hurt ourselves.We have very sandy soil at the location where we have the mole problem . It is almost at sea level and the water table is not far below the surface . The box says the trap is `` triggered by the slightest movement '' , and we are wondering if the sandy soil makes the ground too sensitive for this trap.But , whatever the reason , this trap is not working for us .	-1
Either we have smart moles , or I ca n't follow directions , or maybe the weather has been a factor . I do n't know , but the Sweeney Mole trap has n't caught anything in five weeks here . The yard is covered with tracks . I tried to be careful and selective about placing the trap . I 've tried several different locations , all of which seemed to be active trails . The trap has sprung exactly once , but it was empty.On the other hand , the trap is easy to set up and use . So , in that respect , I ca n't complain . Also , we have had unusually rainy weather here over the last month , so that may have caused behavioral changes for the moles - different trails and such.I do n't know the answer , but we have n't caught any moles !	-1
If points are awarded thusly : 1 point to the moles for each day they evade death and 1 point to me for each mole I kill , the current score is Team Mole : eleven , Me : zero.I have obvious active hills and tunnels in my yard and have followed the directions , watched the video and tried 3 different locations and not had the trap spring even once.Not only is it ineffective but it is hard to use . I ca n't be sure if I have a defective unit or if there is a design flaw , but my trap is intermittently impossible to set . There is a catch that should lock into place when you raise the handle , to hold the spikes up until they are triggered . It is a constant fight to get mine to catch . I 'd say it works 1 out of 15 attempts . Furthermore , I 'd think by design , it should take minimal motion to spring the trap , if you will a hair trigger , so you 'd have the best chance of impaling the vermin . If I ever do get mine to lock in the set position , it is virtually impossible to get it to trigger . The little lever on the side seems to jam so you ca n't spring it manually to test . You can jostle it , kick it , drpo it from shoulder height and throw it across the yard ( which I have in fact DONE ) without springing the trap.I 'm going to keep trying to get this to work because I really hate moles and what they are doing to my yard . If I have any success , I will revise my review but for now , I can not recommend this product .	-1
I had high hopes for this trap . We have a ton of moles here and it was easy to find a mole tunnel to set up the trap according to the directions . Twice the trap was tripped , and no dead mole . After that , the trap is not even being tripped , I have tried everything with this trap to make it kill these pest moles , but with no luck . In my book this is an easy to set trap that does nothing to rid your place of mole infestation . Not a single dead mole to show for the trouble . Not recommended .	-1
With this type of mole trap , dirt has to be soft in order for the spikes to penetrate . So far , we are unable to kill a mole with this trap . In theory , it is well constructed , seems to work perfectly with the mechanism is has , however we have not been able to kill any moles or gophers with this product . I am only giving it two stars because of the type of trap it is , it needs special conditions for it to work properly . Like manicured lawns , with softer dirt than we have . It 's built very well , durable , and will last a long time .	-1
Moles invading our lawn are a bane of ours every year so my husband is constantly seeking out ways to eliminate them . This is not one of them . It takes so much pressure to spring the trap that the mole would almost have to jump into it for it to work .	-1
I am a male of average size ( 5'10 '' tall ) with normal-sized hand ( size Large gloves ) . The pictures show someone with *much* smaller hands . [ 1 ] While these clips might be usable by such a person , they are all but unusable by me.The pictures show three different grips . The one I could get to work best was the one with the loop toward my wrists . [ 2 ] I could get the other two grips to work if my hands were dry . However , with a little moisture , the inherent slipperiness of the clip combined with its mismatch to the size and contours of my hand would cause it to slide around , even off the hand . This was for closing the clip.For opening it , I could get only the first grip to work , and then not every time . The problem is that the finger `` grips '' are too slippery and flexible to apply much pressure to the locking mechanism . The lock is designed to open by the sides shearing away from each other . Although it is possible to pop the lock open ( sides moving directly away from each other ) , the finger loops at too flexible to generate the needed force and I could n't grip the sides strongly enough . The only way I got it to pop was to push the main loop down over my finger until the finger over-filled the loop.The clips were extremely hard to open the first few times that I used them . I found that I needed to open and close them 3-4 times to have any chance of opening them using the finger grips . With more repetitions , it became easier . I would recommend against using these with actual plants without this `` conditioning '' . I have *not* subjected the clips to weathering to know how that affects their operation . [ 3 ] My larger hand and finger size reduced the range of orientations of the clip relative to my hand . This repeatedly resulted in me having to contort my wrist and arm to try to get the clip properly oriented with the stake and the plant stem . [ 4 ] What I wanted from these clips was the ability to reach into difficult locations and to easily and sure-handedly clip a stem to a stake or other support . Instead of being allowed to contort my wrist and arm as needed , these clips forced me to put my hand into contorted positions even for the simplest applications . I practiced applying them using vines I was about to trim and that convinced me to not even try to use them with tender stems -- the sliding around on my fingers was too much . Finally , I have zero confidence that I would be able to open the snap without damaging a tender stem. -- -- [ 1 ] `` smaller hands '' : My thumb and finger fill and/or stretch the loops in the different grips . The pictures show fingers that do n't come close to that . [ 2 ] The picture showing two hands : one closing and one opening the clips . On the package , this is the only one illustrated . [ 3 ] Note : I repeated this experiment on clip after clip in the package with the same result to ensure that I was n't just testing a bad sample . [ 4 ] Notice in the picture with the Sunflower that the hand with the clip is vertical . This is not simply for photo composition , but reflects roughly the position of the hand needed for that grip. -- Douglas B. Moran	-1
Overall I feel as though this product is weak . It is easy to snap together , but very difficult to pull apart . I messed around with them for some time , thinking there must be a knack to it , but I just could n't figure it out . I had to pull it really hard to make it snap back open again and I feel as though this would damage a plant stem . Also , the space left for the stem once snapped together was rather large -- I imagine an Asiatic lily stem fitting in it snuggly , but the pepper plants that I grow ever year would probably have too thin of a stem to fit securely.The best thing about this product is that it is green and is made in a leaf design so as not to draw attention to it . Otherwise though , I think I 'd rather stick with using twine .	-1
Appearance : the clip is designed to look like a plant leaf so is fair at camouflaging itself on a plant stem . It 's cute.Utility : the clip is easy to spread open ( as long it 's already opened and not in the & # 34 ; clicked & # 34 ; closed position ) and close around a plant stem with one hand while the other hand is holding the stem and stake with the other . It 's useful for plants whose stems do n't grow more than a couple of centimeters in width.Although the package says it can secure tomato plants , I 'm not sure what kind of tomatoes it could possibly mean . The tomatoes that I grow in my garden can grow upwards of five feet high and the stems can grow to be two inches in diameter . Although the clip is meant to release rather than & # 34 ; choke & # 34 ; a stem if the stem grows too thick , the reason I clip a plant to a stake , for security or stability of the plant , is then lost . So , not so helpful if the plant stem has outgrown the clip which most of the plants in my garden have and will.The best use for the clips so far has been for small indoor plants such as bamboo and orchids ( although a bit too big for the orchids ) . I will try them next growing season for the vine plants such as cucumbers or peas and see how useful they are for securing them .	-1
I love cordless tools . In fact , I got rid of my Toro electric ( corded ) blower to get this one because I was tired of dealing with the long extension cord.There are some good and bad things about this blower.The PROS are that it 's lightweight , easy to carry and use , and it blows AND sucks up leaves/debris . Plus , no cord to get in the way.However , the biggest CON is that it is not powerful at all . Yes , you can adjust the power with a dial control , but anything less than full power simply wo n't be enough for anything you want to blow unless it 's a piece of tissue paper on a hard flat surface . Even at full power this thing leaves a lot to be desired . For instance , it will blow light dust/leaves from a hard flat surface ( i.e . concrete patio ) . However , it 's not good at blowing leaves from a surface like grass . It even seriously struggles to blow spider webs from my house and lawn furniture.If I did n't already own the Black and Decker 36v lawn trimmer ( which I love by the way ) that uses the same battery , I would have already sent this blower back and tried a different brand .	-1
Most of my lawn gear is gas powered . I have recently invested in both battery and electrical tools . Like all homeowners I 'm always looking for something that does the job better . Though B & D ; owns just about everybody including DeWalt , the brand has never been known as a serious player in lawn gear and power tools . I signed on to test several Black & Decker lawn tools . After four weeks use these are my thoughts on this product.This model comes with ( 1 ) 36 volt lithium ion battery , charger , blow tube , leaf bag , vacuum tube and a two year warranty . Let 's face it . Black & Decker will never win any awards for providing outstanding instructions . Still , out of the box assembly takes seconds . Just snap the nozzle pieces together , lock it into the slot and you 're in business . Fully assembled this unit measures 37 '' long from butt to nozzle tip . With the battery on board the total weight is easily a little over 5 lbs . Unlike my older blower I like the comfortable soft grip feature on this model.This unit operates off of a B & D ; 36 volt lithium ion battery . The battery is outfitted with an onboard power indicator . The power switch is ideally mounted and simple to use . With a flick of the thumb you 're in business . The multi level power switch is also sweet . Just keep in mind the higher the number the less juice users will have in the end . Fully charged I get almost an hour before a noticeable drop off in power . I do enjoy the low noise feature . Make no mistake , this model does suck down the juice . Unlike other B & D ; lithium ion batteries , this battery takes about eight hours to charge . Even after eight hours charging , the battery 's onboard indicator still shows that the battery is not fully charged . For me that 's unacceptable.The blower feature works like a charm . Its not going to beat my gas powered one , but it does perform . It easily took care of my sidewalk , driveway and back patio will no real issues . It also does well clearing small water puddles on the walkway . Conversion to vacuum mode is just a matter of screwing off the intake cap and attaching the leaf bag . Changing out the vacuum tube took a little bit longer and required a rubber mallet to slide into place . Like most of the newer leaf vacuums , the bag is a too small . Its been all miss when it comes to vacuuming leaves.For small properties this tool as a blower works well . The problems that I have encountered with the battery combined with the overall performance of the vacuum feature lowers the rating of this product . Even with a second battery the leaf vacuum is n't going to win me over . Still a second battery is a must if this tool is going to be the primary blower . Overall , I like the direction that Black & Decker is taking with their new lineup of garden tools . Obviously this one needs a little more fine tuning . Its definitely a work in progress .	-1
Our two basic wooden mousetraps that we have in our garage have caught over 100 mice with just peanut butter on them . I do n't see any need for these , especially since they are deadly to humans and pets . Not worth the risk .	-1
The design is such that pets and children would have to work to get at the poison . However , the poison is Bromethalin . One dose is lethal to rodents , and they die within 24 to 36 hours . The downside to this is that they may go elsewhere and die , which may be someplace that you do not want a decomposing creature.A persistent dog could chew on this , and it is deadly to dogs ( and even more so to cats , but they are less likely to be randomly chewing on plastic , at least from what I have observed ! ) . There is no antidote , so if you have a rambunctious dog , you might want to consider a snap trap ( annoying to a dog , but not lethal ) .Now , does it work ? In my experience , nope . I placed these traps along with an electronic trap , and a couple of snap traps along the wall in my garage where I KNOW mice run ( we catch about a half dozen a week ) . After 10 days I pried the station open ( which is not recommended ) to be sure the bait had been gnawed . It had not.I think I would rather go back to my old fashioned snap traps ( at least I know where the dead mice are ) or my new fangled electrocution chamber ( which also kills instantly ) .	-1
These are not likely to be investigated and messed with by a kid or a pet ( cat or a dog ) , can kill multiple mice at once ( up to 4 ) , and can be used both indoors and outdoors.I like that these come pre-loaded and are disposable . With this product , you can just kill all the mice and never need to touch the poison.They eat the poison from the station and die elsewhere . The biggest problem with this product and with poisoning mice ( besides the inhumane treatment of poisoning mice ) is that cats or dogs cat then eat the dead mice and then the pets die that way . Although this product is good at making sure that children and other pets do not get to the poison , the fact that the mice will die somewhere in the house and might be then eaten by your pets who will then die is scary.Also , it should be noted that although 4 seems like a large number , mice tend to exist in large families so one of these stations might not solve the problem in your house or barn .	-1
The product is n't all that easy to get into , but it still poses a threat . There are indeed better and safer options .	-1
Miracle-Gro 's houseplant , liquid fertilizer , USED TO BE GREAT ! I 've used it for decades . I knew exactly how much to add to the water and our plants flourished , year after year . Our 48 year old Christmas Cactus enjoyed the fertilizer between blooming seasons . Now ? I 'm supposed to squirt some foam into the plant 's base . I ca n't even SEE the base of the 48 year old Christmas Cactus , and even if I could , how does one squirt of foam compare to a few drops of the liquid . A conversion chart would have been handy , BETTER YET , drop this foamy stuff and bring back the time-tested , good , reliable , dependable , REAL liquid houseplant fertilizer . In the meantime , I bought another company 's liquid fertilizer . I sure hope I do n't do damage to the plants .	-1
I am comparing this Greenworks Trimmer to my Black & Decker NST2118 Trimmer/Edger , and while both will perform acceptably , the Greenworks model comes up short in terms of ease/comfort of use.Let me start by identifying the Pros : the Greenworks assembles easily . It has a serious battery , which should be enough for medium to large trimming jobs . I do n't honestly know how long it takes to use up a full charge , because my yard did n't come close to using up the charge . The handle is LONG , so if you want to reach back into corners without climbing back there , this is useful , and keeps the trimmings from flying at you because they are so far away . Greenworks incorporated a wheel along the side of the trimmer , so that you can rest the edge on the ground and roll it along the edges of sidewalks . There 's a good bit to like here.The Cons stem from some of the same sources as the Pros : the serious battery and extended length add weight to the Greenworks trimmer , so it will feel heavier as you go . Also , the length is a little too long ( and I am almost feet tall ) , meaning you have to hold it awkwardly and at some strange angles most of the time . Even when the wheel is in place , you have to lean way over close to the ground to roll it along , which puts the user in a position which may strain the back . This undoes the intent of the wheel . It 's just overall not an ergonomically designed item . While I 've seen some people complain about the trigger , I did n't have any problem with it.Most significantly , the weight and length add up to a decrease in overall control of the trimming job , and ultimately , that 's what you buy a trimmer for.All told , between the two , I find the Black and Decker superior for control , comfort , and ease of use . The Greenworks model will do the job , but not comfortably , or as well .	-1
I have tried home-made hot pepper concoctions , an IR sprinkler , and even sticks that first attract the deer and thn give them a shock . None of this works in my garden . This year $ 60 in plants and 40 hours in preparatory labor went down the drain the second night after the garden was planted , and it is behind a 6 foot fence ! We will give the gardin one more try next year using a neighbor 's tip to put a radio in the middle of the garden and have it play music all night long . He does n't even have a fence around his garden ( although I suspect some sort of peppery concoction is spread on the perimeter ) and manage to have enough produce to go to the Saturday Farmer 's Market where I now have to buy all my fresh vegetables . Not recommended .	-1
I just got this feeder to replace an older one that was hard to fill without making a mess . One important point . Its NOT squirrel or raccoon proof as some are . I have this hanging on a tall pole and they can get on the feeder and empty it quickly even with a lube on pole . Ordered the Brome unit to replace this . You get what you pay for .	-1
I filled it and put it outside on my porch . The small birds do n't use it at all . The larger birds have tried several times but they weigh too much and the feeder starts to sway and the birds ca n't hang on and leave .	-1
Ok this is a very neat looking containerbut honestly it is not too practical for storing your yard hoseours is not very long a 50 footer i thinkand it does not wind around the middle column in the pot too wellsome of it ends up sticking up out of the top making the lid pointlessas far as making this a planter..might work ok if you find a pot large enough to put inside this potyou would not want to plant anything directly into this potit has a large hole on the side for the hose to hook to your outdoor spoutso far we have not yet found a pot to put inside to make this a planterBUT we did manage to find a smaller one and then placed a piece of wood in the bottomand set the plant on the topi have had this outside on the porch since the day it arrivedit has gotten wet though not soaked and has not rusted or shown any signs of wearit seems like stamped tin and not a very strong metalwhich is another reason i would never plant directly into it for fear of too much weight from the soilthe bottom of mine kind of pops out and i can bend it back againfor the price honestly i would not bother for a hose holderi really really wanted to like this for the original intention is was made forthe idea is great but it just does not work out for us	-1
I was able to obtain this item for review through the Amazon Vine program . I have a garden hose that must reside rather near my front door , and had been looking for a hose holder that was nice looking , and did not weigh a ton . I thought that this item fit the bill nicely.Pros : The hose holder is nice looking , having an embossed pattern in the metal , and being colored an attractive verdigris green.It is lightweight , and therefore easily moved.It can indeed hold at least a 100-foot 5/8 hose ( see photo ) .The central post can be removed in order to use it for something other than a hose holder.I did not have to order the lid separately , as it came with the lid.Cons : The lid showed rust in just two days , simply from sitting outside overnight in cool damp weather . It was not exposed to sprinklers or rain within that time span . The fact that it started to rust that fast causes me some concern over its long-term durability.Looks like I will have to clean off the rust and coat it with polyurethane or other similar clear coating in order to have it remain good-looking for any length of time , and to avoid rust stains on my concrete.Disappointed . The listed price at this time is $ 94.58 . For that much money I would expect better quality . If I had paid for this item , I would be sending it back .	-1
Made from painted steel , I 'm not sure how long this will look decent when exposed to rain/snow after a couple years . The center piece can be removed ( 3 bolts ) if using as a container to store your fireplace wood or magazines . You could n't use this for a plant unless you have a plant in another pot and set it inside this one ( because of the hole for a garden hose ) .I have a 50 ' garden hose in mine with extra room to spare ; but I doubt it will hold a 125 ' long hose as stated in the description . You know how garden hose gets kinked up after it 's used a few times and it becomes harder to get it to coil back ? I think by mid-summer this 50 foot hose will be hard enough to get it all back in so I can put the lid on , let alone trying to stuff a kinky 125 foot hose inside.Speaking of the optional lid : My main problem with this is the lid ( an additional $ 28 purchase as of this date ) - does n't fit right . I 'm not sure if the hose holder or the lid itself is `` out of round '' but it wo n't fit completely inside the rim of the hose holder . Who knows ... .maybe mine is defective or they are all made like this ( imperfect ) . Picture a pot with a lid you have cooking on the range to let the steam out and that 's the same way the lid fits.Made in India .	-1
This hose holder looks so much better than the old washtub I was using to store my hose , and I 've already gotten compliments . I also have the lid to keep the rain and debris out . I have several concerns though , a couple which I hope may turn out to be unfounded . First of all , it seems very light and thin and I wonder if it may dent easily . Secondly , I wonder how long the finish will last . It appears to be painted with a copper finish and then sealed . The last thing is not technically a concern , but an aggravation . While I like the look of the design , the top is narrow and it 's a bit tedious to feed the hose back in . I 'll update if I have any problems with durability.Update : After a year of use , the finish is shot . Lot of rust and some holes forming .	-1
I have an almost 100 % organic garden and yard and overall I do n't have that big an issue with weeds ( I use a lot of black plastic mulch in my veggies , for example -- you 'll never see weeds again ) , but I have a few areas , like my patio , where they are just out of control . I despise the thought of adding any weed-killing chemicals to my yard for many reasons ( I eat a lot of what comes out of my yard , I have a lot of wildlife that has a hard enough time surviving , I worry about harm to pollinators , etc. ) . But again , for a few areas , I thought this might be a potentially good idea and actually Preen came highly recommended by a local landscaper . After reading the label and precautions , however , I decided to ONLY use it far away from any area where food is grown or where pets might roam ( I would not want my pets licking this off their paws sorry ) .The primary place that I wanted to use the Preen was on my patio which is made of pavers ( like 8 x 12 & # 34 ; ) ; the weeds grow like wildfire in the cracks between the pavers and it make me nuts . Since no other plants grow there I thought it might be safe to use . The trouble in using a powdered form of Preen , I found , is that the stuff just bounces off of the pavers and there ' no way to make sure it goes in the crack . So , that 's no fault of the product or spreader , but that experiment was a failure.I did find a few border areas that are largely gravel ( weeds seem to love gravel beds ) where I tried spreader and it worked ( as far as distribution ) fine . But since it 's still early spring here in New England , I have no idea whether or not this stuff will prevent any weeds . I tried to use it *very* sparingly because , as I said , I have no desire to bomb the yard with any chemicals . The thing is , the power spreader actually does work and you can go through a $ 25 jug of this stuff PDQ ( which is the source of my headline above ) . What a clever idea : add a battery-powered spreader to make sure that you 're blowing through the stuff quickly ! Give that guy a raise.Overall , while I can see the convenience value of this to someone who does n't mind using a weed killer in garden beds and who has no pets , but for me , I felt guilty using it . I think I 'll go back to yanking the weeds ( or using vinegar to kill them ) . I do n't like the idea of hurting wildlife , I think many weeds are good for the pollinators whose populations are declining , I do n't want poison in my yard and this stuff is way too expensive . I would never buy this product , sorry . Please , before you buy it , read the labels and the warnings . If you have a gravel parking area or some other non-natural place where weeds are an issue , perhaps this is a safe product . But in the garden ? I do n't think so .	-1
I 'm not totally into organics , but I do try to avoid pesticides as much as possible . And I try not to use chemicals where I do n't have to . That being said , my feeble attempts at gardening have grown more weeds than produce , so I was quite excited about the possibilities this product posed for my lawn and garden.Unfortunately , the warnings on this product are a bit off-putting . You are cautioned to avoid contact with skin as well as to wear protective eye covering when dispersing this product . If that 's the case , I do n't think I want it near my food , much less my children . So , we were very careful about where we placed it -- on the patio between pavers , and in landscaped areas where the children do n't play . Even had it not been for the children , this weed preventer is not supposed to be used on grass , which was n't clear when we ordered it . Likewise , it does not eliminate existing weeds , just prevents new ones from growing . For me , that was the biggest issue with this product -- to have as many warnings as it does , I 'd expect it to kill the weeds that already exist.The power spreader cap was actually not something that we found useful . The cap flips open , and the & # 34 ; power & # 34 ; is in the flipped lid . Basically , the product is like pebbles that fall onto the cap and then are dispersed outward . You are supposed to control the flow by tilting the entire bottle up or down , just as you would if you did n't have the power cap . Perhaps it might be different when the bottle is n't near to full , but it 's pretty difficult to control the output . And it 's not easy to disperse to smaller areas . Effective or not , I ca n't see myself purchasing this product in the future .	-1
I was really excited about getting this trimmer with all the great reviews . Several problems for me . First I hated the fact that I had to hold down the saftey switch the entire time or it cuts off . My arms were very tired just from having to hold down that stupid saftey switch . Also battery did n't last very long even on a regular sized yard . The charger also kept saying battery too warm even when it was n't warm . Also did n't find the auto feed helpful . Lastly , very weak power . I returned mine and went and bought a Craftsman 4 cycle gas weedwhacker with electric start ( no mixing of oil and gas , electric start so no pulling , starts right up , awesome power , and has a simple no hazzle weed cord that only takes ten seconds to change out and so far have weed eated entire yard and have n't had to change the weed cord yet . Anyway , I do n't usually recommend other products in my reviews but in this case I did because I do n't think any other brand of gas weedeaters have this electric start and no oil mixing except for the Craftsman 4 cycle weedwhacker.Craftsman gas is alittle heavier but buy a $ 10 shoulder strap on you will be fine . My arms are less tired using the gas craftsman and took one fifth the amount of time and energy than we I used the toro electric .	-1
The bird feeder came unassembled in an Amazon box in several pieces with no box or assembly instructions . This could be because it is a vine shipment , because multi-packs are always deboxed and split up . Maybe it was deboxed out of habit . My rating does not reflect the lack of box or disassembly.All but 1 plate was unattached . It was fairly easy to see how to reattach them , but awkward for large hands . There are 3 bendy clips along each metal corner to hold the plastic face plates in . They are a little stronger than 1940 's Manila Envelope metal clips , but not much . All of mine were welded on and already covered with rust . And they want you to wash this with soapy water every 2 weeks . I would assume this will cause it to self destruct within the year.The copper veneer is nice looking , but thin . It may not stand up well to weather . There is no detailed screen printed design of birds and berries on all four sides of this feeder ! Look at the first picture . This is what mine looks like . The sure lock squirrel proof cap lock does not work on mine . It barely makes a difference on how fast you can raise the lid whether or not you press the button.This makes a good Squirrel & Bird feeder & seed shaker . But this is not what it is advertised for . As a Squirrel proof , small bird , outdoor feeder , I can only give it 2 stars .	-1
this was a cute idea , and it came packaged quite securely , but the handle had a leak in it and all the water leaked out within seconds . Not usuable in any way shape or form . It would 've been a great addition to our nature area in our backyard and I am sad it 's not going to work .	-1
Attracting birds , butterflies , and other melodic/colorful creatures to one 's outdoor surroundings is a common goal and the easiest way to achieve this is through a watering device . After all , every living creature needs water and a plentiful supply is bound to attract them.With the Perky Pet water cooler , you get a cute- looking watering container that is small , lightweight- even when filled with water- and easy to fill . The cooler is designed in the shape of an actual cooler used by people and the cuteness factor alone will convince many to give it a try.I like that this water cooler is smaller and easier to use , but it is not without its fault and the first one I experienced was when I tried to hang it up . I have hooks on my back porch , but they are stationary . The loop at the top of this cooler is also stationary and it is n't very large . The stationary factor means the only way to attach is by tilting the cooler and when you do , the water will come pouring out . This is why it is best to hang this on a moving hook or find a flexible hook to attach to the cooler first . Otherwise , you will lose a portion of the water every time you fill it and reattach.I could tolerate the water loss issue , but one thing I could not handle is that this little cooler just does n't attract any wildlife . I was puzzled at first and even took it moved it to a tree , just to see what would happen . Still , there was no sign of any birds or other creatures trying to get at the water . Days later , the water was still at the same level as before . I checked other reviews and it looks like I am not alone- others have complained of the same problem . And it appears that the main issue is the small size of the base . It is too little to attract anything except the smallest of birds . I do not have any smaller birds in my area , hence a water cooler that remains full and untouched.As I said , this water cooler is cute and it could fulfill the needs of some people , but it is no use for me and I have already taken it down and placed it in permanent storage in the garage . I may try again later but for now I 'm going to chalk this up as a good idea with a faulty design .	-1
[ Revised 2013-06-09 = beginning of week 5 when the chickadees starting to use it regularly ] + [ Additional updates on progress ] My situation : I have a variety of small birds -- chickadees , titmice , bushtits , wrens , ... -- that drink out of the ant traps on myHummingbird Feeders , both integral and supplementary ( Trap-it Ant Trap for Hummingbird Feeders ) . I was interested in something better . Because of the leaping ability of the neighborhood cats , I will not locate feeders or this product with less than 5.5 foot ( bottom ) clearance ( higher in many locations ) .This requirement for hanging at this height requires using a small ladder and made this product inconvenient for me ( unless I see some subsequent advice ) , hence the rating . I currently have it in a location that I would not have otherwise chosen in order to make the use of a ladder practical ( although still somewhat inconvenient ) . Even if you do n't have my situation , this product may still be inconvenient for you to hang.It has taken the chickadees 4 full weeks to become accustomed to using this waterer ( details below ) . I have _observed_ none of the other small birds using it , but that may simply be that the chickadees call more attention to themselves . I have just observed the titmice , which are somewhat larger , landing _vertically_ on the perch , but do n't seem to know how to access the water tray ( yet ? ) . As for the wrens , they may not have the right type of athletic ability to land on the perch . [ Update Week 7 : The chickadees are now using it enthusiastically , but still none of the other birds that visit the adjacent feeder have been observed using it . The visits of the titmice and wrens to the feeder often overlap those of the chickadees , so it is n't for lack of examples for using the waterer . ] [ Update : In Week 8 which was a very hot spell , the titmice started making occasional , tentative sips . In Week 9 , they are becoming somewhat more confident . In Week 11 , titmice have become enthusiastic . It is an amazingly slow process , especially compared to the quick adoption of new feeders . The wrens that visit the feeder still have n't tried it , nor have any of the flock of bushtits that daily pass within feet of it . ] -- -- The hanging loop is too small and impossible to see from below . Even practicing with the container empty , I could n't put it on a typical screw-in hanging hook much above eye-level on the first or second try . It has to be tilted at a considerable angle and wiggled about to find the hole . With a full container , I was unable to get it onto the hook without several inches of water pouring down my arm , and usually most of the water in the jug spilled . With the hook at eye-level , putting it on a stationary ( screw-in ) hook typically spilled about an inch of water . Spill-less hanging seems to require a large S-hook , and since that precludes your holding the container from the side or bottom , that in turn limits how high you can hang with without using a ladder or other device. -- -- Bird use : I hung this close to a popular bird feeder ( peanuts ) where it would be a convenient perch for birds waiting their turn -- the hanging flower pot that it replaced was used for just that . It was over two weeks before first known use -- I hear the chirping as the birds arrive at the feeder and usually get a secondary alert from my cat . To supplement direct observation , I put newspapers under a quarter-full jug and looked for speckling from the water drips that I expected would happen when birds landed . Note : I switched back to a full jug before observing the first arrival , and that chickadee did n't produce enough movement to spill any water . During weeks 3 and 4 , only the larger adult chickadee used the waterer -- the smaller adult ( mate ? ) who feeds second continued to drink from the nearby ant-trap even though it was in a somewhat more exposed location ( there are Cooper 's Hawks , so they switch off on look-out duties ) . At the beginning of week 5 , the juvenile chickadees started showing up at the feeder and they quickly adopted the waterer and the smaller adult started using it as well.My suspicion is that the perch is just too close to the water jug for even small birds to land comfortably . The adult chickadees that I have seen using it land not head-in , but vertically or sideways on the perch , appearing to also use a connector bar ( between the perching circle and the tray ) . The adult chickadees also drink predominantly sideways -- they duck down and turns their heads sideways to get at the tray . The juvenile chickadees are small enough to drink head-on.This observation screams that the tray-perch is much too small relative to the jug. -- -- Cleaning : questionable adviceThe typical advice for cleaning hummingbird feeders is to use vinegar and to avoid soap . Some claim that hummingbirds hate soap 's taste , other that it causes problems with their digestive system ( or they may hate the taste because of those problems ) .Consequently , I was surprised that the advice was to clean with mild soap . Soap and vinegar have very different roles . Detergents such a soaps are molecules that have one end that binds to water and the other to a oil or grease molecule and thus allows water flow to pull off not just that oil/grease but everything else that is attached to it . Vinegar is a weak acid that tears apart or dissolves other types of contaminants . This is why you will find both in many cleaning products . My understanding of the types of problems likely to occur -- minerals and harmful biologics -- are ones dealt with by vinegar and on which soap has little/no effect . There is no mention of bleach ( either way ) . -- -- Apparent theory of operation ( beyond the basics ) : The slots that release the water into the tray are very thin . When I first turned over the feeder , the water released did n't even completely cover the bottom . But rock the feeder even slightly -- as it would in the wind or from birds landing -- and more water is released . This has the potential to do more than just replenish the water in the tray -- the currents _might_ help float debris up and over the sides . I could simulate a little of this by hitting the perch with my finger , but it would take actual birds landing to confirm this speculation.Observation from current use : With evaporation and without periodic rocking , the water in the tray can become very depleted -- not completely covering the bottom -- which might then not provide sufficient attraction for birds to land and providing the rocking to do the replenishment.Suggestion : One might want to periodically give this product a tap to release a bit more water into the tray. -- Douglas B.

When it comes to birding , cleanliness is very important . With the jug handle , this waterer is hard to clean , even with a flexible brush . I have lots of finches , and with finches , comes conjunctivitis , and being able to clean this properly is very important . Sure , I could just slosh some bleach around it when cleaning , but I 'm not comfortable not being able to scrub each and every inch of this . If it has been one solid jug , it would 've been much easier to clean.I 've had it up for a few weeks now and have not noticed one bird on it . Only small birds can use this , which I have plenty of ( sparrows , finches , chickadees , nuthatches , etc ) . Initially I did put it up a few feet away from a thistle feeder , and the goldfinches abandoned the feeder . Once I moved this waterer , the birds came back . Strange , but not unheard of . It 's now near the bird bath and still , no takers .	-1
My Perky Pet Water cooler is too small for all but the smallest of birds to sit on the ledge while drinking . There is no stabilization so it swings back and forth as soon as a bird does land on it , consequently the bird flies off because it 's swinging . You have to take it completely down to fill and then screw off the bottom which is where the birds poop is . I would n't recommend this product just because you have to get it down from the tree , and then touch bird excrement and then the birds do n't use it anyway because it sways and is just too small . Mine did not come with a hook to hang it so you 'll have to find your own S hook or string to hand it with .	-1
I live in an extremely dry area , so I would think that the birds I feed would welcome water . After over a week , though , I have yet to see any evidence that they are getting a benefit from this . I recognize two parts of the problem but not the full problem.To begin with , the hook on the top of the container will not fit over many hooks or nails , so I had to use some nylon line to hang the waterer . If you buy one , there is a plastic tie that holds on the tag and instructions ( if these can be called instructions ) , and I recommend you do n't cut it off as I did . That little tie should be enough.Filling the plastic bottle with water was easy enough , and attaching the base was easy , too . But that 's when I noticed the first problem . Very little water actually came out . The next day , when I went to check , the dish from which the birds are supposed to drink was bone dry . So I shook the bottle a bit and induced some water into the dish . The next day , the dish was dry again . Once again , I jiggled the bottle and managed to get a little bit of water into the dish.I 've tried screwing the base on more tightly and doing so more loosely , but water simply does not seem to want to leave the bottle and settle in the dish . That 's the first part of the problem.The second part is that the base seems just too small for many birds . In the time I have had this , I must have looked at it forty or fifty times . There have been birds galore on the feeder two feet to the right of the water bottle but never a bird on the water tray.I gave it two stars rather than one in deference to those who love it . Perhaps my bottle is just defective in some way . But , having disassembled it and inspected it ( thinking perhaps that the plastic had n't been cut back sufficiently where the water was supposed to come out -- not the problem , I discovered ) , I can not recommend this product .	-1
I 've had this up for a couple weeks now and have yet to see any birds on it . The problem seems to be that the perches are quite small and there is n't a lot of drinking space ; the design requires that the bird sort of duck under the jug . We 'll see what we 'll see , but so far this has been a bust for me - on my wooded property most avian visitors are woodpecker or cardinal -size birds - this seems designed for small finches.The design of the thing is pretty clever , but you WILL lose some water when turning it upside-down . Once upright the water wicks out somehow - provided you screwed the jug in fully.It 's pretty small . Maybe if you are trying to encourage sparrows and drive pigeons away it would be good ?	-1
Before I start my review let me give you an overview of the environment : We have a decently large size backyard with lots of trees and shrubs . We never really needed to attract birds as they love our backyard anyways due to the peace and serenity we tend keep in the backyard . we also do not have a dog or small child to scare the birds away . We generally sit by the patio on pleasant evenings and watch birds with ease as they keep chirping , digging for worms and or merely having fun . Over the years we have seen certain species of birds ( we call them the 'usual ' suspects ) who are not scared of us anymore and go about doing their business chasing each other or just like to dig for worms from the backyard lawn.When Amazon offered me this Perky-Pet Water Cooler Bird Waterer for review I gladly accepted to review it thinking that we will be able to watch these birds drink water from time to time and moreover as summer is around the corner we will be able to provide some thirst relief to the birds in our backyard.The product received for review is cute and well constructed - there is no doubt in that . It Looks good , functions and obeys laws of physics and drips water automatically as designed but sadly does not attract birds of any kinds as of yet . It has been nearly a week and I have not seen a single bird ever drink water from it . They zoom fly past by it never even looking at it once.I personally think the problem is with the base . The base in my opinion is too small for the types of birds in our backyard to land on and drink water thereby avoiding it completely . I am reading other reviewers who have had some degree of success with it . It is possible that those who have had success might be due to small birds in their backyard.Anyways , as the product did not attract birds as expected I am currently rating it with 2 stars . Attractive to humans but not birds is my feedback with the original design . I have plans to make the base a bit wider by attaching a plastic plate underneath the waterer and hang it in the same tree . I will update my review with my findings . Please see the comments section with in next couple of weeks or so with my updated results .	-1
Really awful design.The product works on the principle of suction , so be careful when flipping it over to hang . I spilled water all over my kitchen and myself ! It does not come with any hanging equipment , so be sure to purchase that if you get this product.I think the perky pet people forgot that this product hangs outside and is frequently going to be pooped on by birds . The water bottle top and the blue water dish below screw on and off . The water bottle top needs to be turned right side up to fill . It can not be filled while still hanging on the tree.I do not wish to handle a poop laden water cooler every time this product needs refilling.Also , I tried to cut a hole in the bottom of the water bottle so I could fill it with water from the top . DO NOT do this , the whole thing works on the principle of suction , and once it has a hole in the bottom it wo n't work anymore.Anyway , the plastic seems like good quality because it took a lot of effort for me to cut a hole through it . The water dish is of less solid construction.All in all , I would not recommend this product at all.Update : I filled it up with birdseed , but unless you have very tiny granules of seed , it wo n't work . The seed just gets stuck and you have to empty it by unscrewing it . ( Which defeats the purpose of cutting a hole in it ) .	-1
I was quite excited about it at first when this bird waterer first came out . Unfortuatly , it does n't work too well . First , the device should come with an axilliary hook for hanging it . If you have a rigid pole with a firm hook at its end , it would be much more convenient to hang this had it came with a hook to go between the waterer and the pole . That way you can hang it without turning it sideway to fit it onto the pole . The device is not too attractive and looks just like what it is , an ugly plastic jug . The dish on the bottom surrounding the water container is too narrow for birds to have enough of a ledge to land on and to stand up in order to start drinking . The space is just too tight for anything but the smallest of birds . Lastly , water does not run out of the jug nicely to fill the dish on the bottom unless aided by a little shaking which is an absurdly inconvenient thing to have to do . This device has too many problems to work well .	-1
This feeder is even prettier in person . The color is deeper red than it looked to me in the picture and it is beautiful when the sun hits it.The only thing keeping this from being a perfect feeder for me is there is n't a perch and I love to watchthe hummingbirds sit and look around . But I keep a feeder out with a perch too so I have the best of both worlds in observing them.Very pretty design in the glass too . Assembled in the USA of Chinese Parts . *Update* I decided to take it down and put up a different one . This is such a pretty feeder , but it 's not practical . Also , after a month of use the red has started chipping off already . Cleaning the base is simple , but the inside glass gets slimy and the mouth of the bottle is so narrow that I ca n't get anything in there to clean it out . I shake soap and water in it , but it still has some slime .	-1
This feeder holds just the right amount of nectar but after a few refills it began leaking . Eight ounces is a good quantity for the birds to consume before the feeder should be washed out and refilled with fresh fluid . When we first used it we were impressed with its superior functionality . It 's also attractive to have hanging outside a window . Unfortunately , even though we gave it gentle handling and good care , it began to leak and ultimately became useless .	-1
I 've had many hummingbird feeders , but this is the first one that opens from the top . It is so much easier to fill , I did n't even need a funnel . And cleaning the glass jar is so much easier also . And if I 'm going to be gone for a few days , I can top the nectar off . I like the ant moat on top also , as I do have that problem . I wish it was a little deeper though , as I think it will dry up very fast on hot days . I do n't know if this feeder comes in a larger size , but if it does , I would like one . I feed a lot of hummers ! By the way , you do n't need artificially colored purchased nectar . Just boil 4 parts water and one part sugar for a couple of minutes , and let it cool.Well , sadly I 'm only giving this 2 stars now instead of 5 . Why ? Because the hummers do n't like it . It 's not because it does n't have a base . My other glass feeder does n't either , and they love my old one . I have this one hanging in a small oak tree , so the have lots of places to sit after eating . So I think it must be the rubbery flowers . maybe I can switch the flowers from my other old perky pet feeder .	-1
PLEASE NOTE ADDITION TO REVIEW BELOW.I *love* this hummingbird feeder ! ! ! I have two others , both your standard cheap feeder that is so difficult to fill because of a small opening , and once filled , you have to flip it upside down and it notoriously drips across my deck , inviting ants to the sugar syrup . This Perky-Pet 24 ounce Glass feeder , however , fills from a VERY large top opening ! It also has an `` ant moat '' on the top which you can fill with water so your feeder is n't crawling with sugar-seeking ants . What a great idea ! Another plus is that this feeder holds a full 24 ounces of food , while the smaller cheaper units hold only 8 ounces . My birds will be so happy ! Just an FYI . Do you know you can make your own hummingbird food for your feeder ? You do n't need to buy the expensive packets that include red food coloring , which the birds do n't need . Simply boil 4 cups of water in a pan , add 1 cup of sugar , stir until sugar is dissolved , and boil gently for 2 more minutes . Let it cool and put in your feeder . My birds love this food and there is no reason to have to add any red coloring.I highly , highly recommend this Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder . Another FYI . When you take the feeder out of the box , you 'll think it comes with no hook to hang it with , but look under the top lid and you 'll find it.My hummingbirds are so happy ! ADDED 08/10/13 : I return to revise this review . After 2 weeks of using the hummingbird feeder , it started to leak around the base near the flower feeders . This base comes apart for cleaning , but there is no gasket of any kind to create a water tight seal . Once I took it apart to clean , it never sealed properly again . My husband even used an epoxy glue around the base in an effort to seal it , but that did n't work . I ended up having to throw the feeder away ! ! ! So fair warning -- this feeder looks good , has great potential , but since it wo n't hold the liquid for more than 24 hours it 's actually quite useless .	-1
This is a revision of a previously posted review . I had to bump my rating down to 1 star.We very occasionally get hummingbirds in our yard , and I do have a feeder , as well as `` hummingbird-friendly '' plants . Because people in the area have been seeing more of these winged jewels , and because the rufous hummingbird is said to be expanding its range into the Midwest , I am trying to do everything possible to lure these little beauties into our yard.Perky Pet makes bird feeders that are reliable ( based on my previous Amazon Vine selections ) , so when this came up on the catalog , I requested it right away . ( Also , our local bird authorities at Wild Bird store highly rate the brand on many levels . ) It 's an attractive item . The red should draw in the hummingbirds , and the feeding ports are soft rubber flowers that appear very accessible to the bird . There 's an ant moat at the top of the feeder , a little trough that you fill with water to drown invading ants , and so keep the bird stations clear of insects . Assembly for filling , and cleaning , is simple.The feeder is fairly large . Because Chicago gets few hummingbirds compared to other parts of the country , a full feeder would last a year even if you have a steady stream of visitors . If you live in Texas and your garden is the center of hummingbird activity in your area , maybe that 's practical . But a 24 oz feeder is a little too big . The temptation to fill it up and then wait until it 's half empty means that stale nectar will just sit in the feeder , attracting nothing besides suicidal ants.Initially I thought there was no hanger included . Then another reviewer ( see below ) pointed out to me that the hanger is taped inside the lid ... which I had not noticed , even though I had to remove the lid to fill the hanger . So I went out to check , and sure enough , there it was -- -but it 's really inadequate . It 's just a little S-hanger , like you get with your dog 's rabies tag . So , we still had to make one . We used one of those fake caribiners.The other Perky Pet feeders we received did have hangers attached.We 've had it up for a few months now , and have yet to see a hummingbird . That 's okay , because I know they 're in the area . I think they 'll discover our yard next year when our various trumpet vines mature and we get a jump on the season.But they wo n't be coming for this particular feeder ... we had to throw it out . The seam where the glass meets the base started leaking . We considered attempting a repair with epoxy , but I do n't know if that would have introduced toxins into the materials . So we cut our losses and removed the feeder entirely . We still have another feeder out there , and we 'll probably replace the Perky Pet with another feeder similar to the one that has remained intact .	-1
I unboxed this chipper and thought it looked pretty nice for the money . I fired it up and chipped a few very small pine twigs to start . So far , so good . Then I started to feed 1/2 '' to 3/4 '' pine branches in and within a minute the machine started to vibrate like it was going to fall apart . I opened the cover and there was nothing lodged or inside at all but the machine continued to vibrate.I contacted the manufacturer who promptly replied that they 'd be sending me a replacement . Wow - I was impressed that they were serious about taking care of their customers . Except that ... that was all talk ! That offer came 21 days ago , and guess what - no replacement . Emails back and forth from them explain that they 're upgrading systems and ca n't ship anything until their systems are upgraded . HUH ? 3 weeks of not shipping anything ? Walk it to the post office then . Do something ! Do n't just tell me your systems are down for the better part of a month and you ca n't do anything about it ; that 's ridiculous . As of today they do n't even respond to inquiries as to what the status of my replacement is . I 'm very carefully watching the days so that I do n't end up getting stuck with this thing because of Amazon 's 30 day return policy . My biggest concern is that I threw away the box when they emailed me informing me that they 'll be sending a new one with a box to return the old one in.I 've been using the unit despite the vibration , and it just does n't perform well . Sometimes it shoots out entire branches ( especially rose branches that are fresh ) . They 're dinged up , but intact - not chipped . If you try anything over 3/4 '' you 're just going to be frustrated and disappointed . The machine will take a small cut then the motor will stop and the circuit breaker pops and then it wo n't start up again for 20 minutes . If you try chipping pine with needles attached , it does absolutely nothing with the needles - they come out totally whole , not shredded one bit.Chipping short branches is also very difficult . Instead of feeding them , the unit will just bounce them up and down back and forth and then eventually they jam and you have to take the unit apart.Opening the cover to clear those frequent jams is a CHORE . You have to turn a tiny little wheel that 's tucked into the back of the machine for what seems like forever and then pry the cover open . The design is terrible ; someone with arthritis would not be able to accomplish this task even once.The little feeder piece that you 're supposed to use to push the leaves or green matter through is complete junk . The first time I had to put any force on it , the top of it split wide open ; it 's cheaply made.All in all , I think 1 star is 1 too many . Not only does the unit not perform well , the manufacturer seems to be trying everything they can to weasel out of honoring their warranty . ***Update -- just before we hit the 30 day mark , I received my replacement . While I 'm very disappointed in the length of time it took to get me a working unit , I must say that the replacement is like a completely different machine . It does n't jam constantly , it does n't vibrate , the motor seems like a completely different motor - at least twice as strong as the original I received and has only jammed once in 3 days of use vs. every 10 minutes . This new machine is working quite well for my needs maintaining a 1 acre yard with lots of trees . It does excellent work on my smaller limbs , rose trimmings , and even shreds up the garden weeds . You do need to alternate between hard wood and greens or it will get `` stuffed up '' . ******2nd update : Blades are worn out . Totally worn out . Try finding a replacement . Absolutely nothing available on Amazon ; I guess this was designed as a throw away item . What a disappointment***	-1
WELL YOU HAVE TO WORK TEN TIMES BACK AND FORWORD TO GET RID OF WEEDS . Weed killer is better . Sorry it looks attractive but you need a lot of energy to kill your weeds . May be it is good to scratch your lawn for seeding .	-1
As we move away from rat bat poison feeding stations ( to save wildlife that eats the dead rats and then dies because of the poison in them , and to prevent rats from dying in your walls and stinking to high heaven ) this is an option I considered . Well , let me tell you , this thing did catch a rat quickly but I frankly do n't even want to type what I found the next day when I found the rat on this glue pad . It was something out of a horror movie and I felt so bad that I inflicted that kind of suffering on any creature , even a rat ( and I HATE HATE HATE RATS ! ! ! HATE ! ! ! ) .So , I 'm switching back to snap traps , which kill the rats instantly ( in most cases ) . Sorry , I ca n't recommend these .	-1
I would love to build one life-size and stick the inventor on one of these things . Any animal , target species or not , will die a slow , cruel death , often breaking every bone in its body trying to free itself from this monstrous device . When used outdoors owls have gotten trapped in those damn things when they tried to grab a perceived easy prey item.We are trying hard to get these horrible traps banned from markets , so please help spread the word . You would not want your kids or pets to get stuck on these things , so why would any decent human being want to torture wildlife ? There are more humane methods to kill rats , this is absolutely , most definitely , the worst possible choice !	-1
This review is from : iPower GLFANXBOOSTER6 Inline Ducting Booster Fan with Cord , 6 inch ( Lawn & Patio ) Customer review from the Amazon Vine Program ( What 's this ? ) This booster fan has limitations that make it a great solution only under certain circumstances.1 ) This must be the primary fan because it otherwise slows air too much when not powered up and running.2 ) This fan moves air very well . The other side of that benefit is the noise . It will be a constant noise , although that can be mitigated through the use of inexpensive insulation.3 ) There are no speeds . It 's on or it 's off.4 ) The pricing is more than fair . That makes it tempting to use this in other than the precise circumstances it requires .	-1
This is a huge bag of the repellent . Sadly , this is also a product that 's been discontinued for the reason that it most likely does n't work . After following instructions and spreading the repellent over 4 days in different parts of the yard , I have not been able to spot any difference . I switched to Tomcat 34532 Mole and Gopher Liquid Repellent , 32-Ounce and was able to drive the mole ( s ) elsewhere .	-1
I had really hoped this product would get rid of the mole ( s ) or gopher ( s ) that have built tunnels in and under my vegetable garden . This is the first year I 've had to deal with these rodents possibly because of all the wet weather we have experienced this year creating very soft ground for the pests to play in.If I understand this product correctly it 's not poison and will not harm moles or gophers . The moles and gophers are supposedly repelled by the scent this leaves behind . Whatever it 's supposed to do , it 's not doing it . I 'm seeing more and more tunnels every day . Application is easy , I 'll give it an extra star for that , it just does n't work .	-1
I 'm not sure that this is the most effective way to deal with moles in the yard . It is just a repellent so it 's used to repel moles not to kill them or eliminate them . For me , the application process is quite lengthy and time-consuming for just a repellent . You have to apply daily to different areas of the lawn for 4 days in a process of trying to get the moles to move away from your lawn . Each day the process takes watering 20 minutes at a time . I think it an time-consuming process for something that is just an iffy solution from a product that has been discontinued by the manufacturer .	-1
Would not use and will not repurchase . Inhumane product , promotes lengthy death .	-1
I 'd rather chase the varmints away than kill them , but this is n't the product that works , not for me anyway . I guess that 's why it 's been discontinued .	-1
There has been relatively significant traffic of moles under the soil in my yard . I have tried a wide variety of repellants , traps , and poisons for moles , but not all of them have worked , but this one did not work well . I spread them over the mounds where moles were most active , but still this product was ineffective in decreasing the mole activity .	-1
Applied as directed , it was easy to apply , but unfortunately have n't seen much difference in gopher activity . They are persistent ! I was hoping this would work . Also , this seems to have been discontinued by the manufacturer ...	-1
This repellent does n't seem to work at all . We 'd recommend using spikes instead because this product did nothing to keep them out of our yard .	-1
I was sent another mole product and I hoped this one might work better.I used it as instructed and spread it around my first yard where there are two to four active moles tunnels running paying particular attention to the areas nearest my flowerbeds that I spent thousands of dollars to build over the years . The moles have been venturing into the flowerbeds and causing damage so I was hoping to prevent them from coming into them in the first place.I applied this product once but it rained less than 24 hours after that . So when the mole activity seemed more intense a few days later I reapplied it this time only around the flowerbeds in a more concentrated form.The activity seems to be less but I ca n't be sure this product is the reason . If it is , it might be because of the increased concentration I used but that was n't as directed and it should have have required as much to work if the product performed as promised .	-1
I think the spike trap method works a lot better than this one . I do n't like hurting moles though since they are good for the environment if not our lawns and gardens . No positive effects noted .	-1
Tomcat Mole & Gopher Repellent is a spray application that is to be used with your garden hose . The active ingredient is castor oil . Castor oil mixes with water to penetrate the soil . You can use it immediately after seeing the presence of moles or as a preventative treatment.The application is easy to use but I 'm not sure that this is the most effective way to deal with moles in the yard . It is just a repellent so it 's used to repel moles not to kill them or eliminate them . I think it depends on what type of solution you are looking for . For me , if you repel them , they are just going to move to a new spot in the yard.The bottle will cover an area of 100 ' x 100 ' area . It also is necessary to apply again if heavy rainfall falls right after application . It may be necessary to purchase quite a bit of product depending on the size of the area that you are having the mole trouble . I think it an expensive iffy solution from a product that has been discontinued by the manufacturer .	-1
One side of my house is a favorite gathering place for burrowing animals . I hooked up this smelly gunk to a hose and every day I sprayed the entire area of the house where the holes are located until the container was empty . The result ? More holes . It is easy to understand why the manufacturer discontinued this product . The only thing it provides is a stinky odor . The forecast is for thunderstorms which will take care of the odor . Win some , lose some . This one is a loser .	-1
I had the chance to try this out and I ca n't rate the product itself much , all I can rate is the bottle sprayer part because that failed me . I hooked up my garden hose to the bottle as directed and tried using it and it did n't spray as you would have thought . Upon closer inspection it looks like the nozzle part actually has a crack in it which pretty much rendered this useless . I do n't know if it came from the company damaged or was damaged in shipping but in my case this was not useful at all due to poor/cheap design of the sprayer which failed .	-1
Did not work . We have a groundhog that lives under our deck . He is very active and comes in and out through a hole in a corner of the desk . He has a back door hole another 100 feet away . I followed the instructions and provided a heavy application , especially around ( and in ) the two holes . 12 hours later , the groundhog was happily going in and out of the same two holes . I actually hooked this up to the hose while he was out sunning himself on the lawn . I sprayed him directly . He did n't seem to care and went back to chomping the grass in the same spot I sprayed.At the end of my application , there was still a bit of product left in the bottle . So , I dumped it fully concentrated down the hole . No effect whatsoever.The listing says it was discontinued . I 'm not sure sure why , specifically . But this does not work on my groundhog .	-1
I had hopes for it , being the type of guy that would rather chase the critters away than kill them . But after several tries , I had no success .	-1
There has been relatively significant traffic of moles under the soil in my yard . I have tried a wide variety of repellants , traps , and poisons for moles , but not all of them have worked , but this one did not work well . I am not sure if the product was too diluted or it simply did not work . If this product is good , then why is it that the manufacturer discontinued this product ?	-1
Using this has been a challenge given the time constraints of the Vine Program I received it through -- it has been a very rainy month but I did manage to use it once . After I 've used it again I 'll come back and update this review IF the results are different but I 'm not hopeful.I followed the directions on the product and sprayed this over the first two flowerbeds that have been wrecked by mole tunnels . Three days later there are new even larger tunnels in the beds as though this spray attracted them ! The only positive is that this did not damage the plants and flowers in any way , they look as good as ever , and the number of butterflies and bees seems steady .	-1
All excitement about this fire pit went out the window as soon as I placed the base of the fire pit on the ground . As many other reviewers have mentioned , this fire pit is extremely wobbly and does not rest flush against the ground , which drove me absolutely crazy as I tried figuring out whether or not my brick patio was uneven . I even went and grabbed a level to make sure of it , and after getting positive confirmation , I knew with certainty that this fire pit is uneven , which is an absolute shame because the pictures make it look extremely stylish . As for the other parts , you can tell they are of relatively low quality , and nothing at all really seems to fit just right on this fire pit . There are better options out there , especially considering the price , so take a pass on this poorly made offering .	-1
This is over $ 200 and I 'd say it 's worth , maybe $ 49 to $ 79 . Even then , I 'd look for a better product in any price range . It was easy enough to put together , even for me , but when I put it on it 's feet it was so not substantial . It reminds me of these super cheap bar stools we got once ... no one ever sat in them because they just felt cheap and wobbly.When I read that I could not use this on my deck , I was even more disappointed . You have to drag it out into the yard to use it , where I already have a nice , sturdy , rock fire pit . In the grass it was a little less tippy , but all-in-all I 'd pass on this one . I had one fire in it and kept the hose very close-by in case it just crashed to the ground . I am going to let it air out a bit and use it on my deck , filling it with flowers .	-1
When looking at this product I see something sleek and modern with appealing aesthetics , but beyond that there is nothing I can find that would make this product worth getting . When making the decision on a fire pit quality of the materials used should be a deciding factor , this could make a big difference in how long the pit lasts . There were quite a few pieces for assembly and once they were all together the pit was unstable and rocked back and forth like the legs were uneven , something that can not possibly be safe , and the bowl is thin which also seems unsafe . The only way I can see this thing lasting longer than a few months is for someone to build a paver wall around it ( for stability ) and to NEVER move it because this stand/base seems like it would n't last more than a few moves around the patio .	-1
Well , I 'm setting here wondering what positive to say on this item . Its poorly built , flimsy and reeks of the words `` fire hazard . '' The way it is put together is easy enough , unfortunately in all the wrong ways . That 's terribly disappointing , too , because I had high hopes for this item , imagining myself enjoying it while taking to the summer - when it finally comes . The cost , to me at least , seems astounding , considering how flimsy the build on it is . Really , the wind moves it around outside , causing it to shift back and forth every few minutes.It looks cool anyhow ; and considering that 's all I can do with it and feel safe , I guess that 's a mild something .	-1
This product is designed to capture tiny mice . Mice around where i am are not giant , but not tiny mice . I guess your average mouse is not tiny . It can catch an average sized mouse , but the noise and movement of the mouse inside stops any other mouse from being caught . And it is not big enough to catch large mice ( not rats which is definitely not possible )	-1
Over this winter I 've been getting small field mice in my garage looking for a warm place to stay . I 've been placing several plastic classic-type ( trigger snaps a lid closed on mouse ) traps that have worked very well . When I was offered this I was excited to try one that could collect multiple mice . I am very disappointed.It 's unclear how this even works to trap the mice ( I guess I 'll find out if it ever works ) as it sits on the floor and the underneath is hollow . I placed this in the same space as the plastic traps and the plastic traps are still collecting mice and this one sits unused.I 'll update this if I ever catch a mouse with this . Until then I 'll stick with the classic snap closed type of traps.UPDATE : after nearly a week in the garden shed where I know mice are active at times I still have n't caught anything .	-1
The Victor tri-kill mouse trap is an interesting pest control product . It is very easy to use and set . There is no chance of accidental injury . Baiting it was no problem . I was a little worried about how light it was.I baited the trap with peanut butter and set it . I placed in an area where we have tons of mice come in from the field . In that same area I have a bunch of traditional cheap sticky traps . I checked this trap for two weeks . I have often found it moved slightly from where I left it . But I have never found a mouse in it . The sticky traps in the same area are catching tons of mice . I can only conclude that this is not a great trap.There are some real pros to this design . Perhaps Victor can revisit it and make it a little more effective .	-1
The Victor Tri-Kill Mouse Trap is a good idea in theory but in practice a trap to catch a single mouse is better . This trap does not have separate sealed chambers but is more like a roofed room with three doors and no floor or interior walls . It does not have a strong metal spring to instantly kill the mice but a bar that catches and strangles them while leaving them exposed . I would prefer a single trap to catch & release the mice or if necessary , one that would kill them instantly and humanely over this method .	-1
You have to feel back for the lonely inventor , ever striving to make a better mousetrap . The design of this trap is creative , it 's a snare ( basically a plastic noose ) . However , in our tests in an old house , traditional snap traps continue to catch mice , and this one has n't .	-1
While this is a good looking trap , I ca n't say that it did much . I had it set up for a couple of weeks in my mother-in-laws house because she said she saw a mouse in her house . Well , I put three snap traps down , and the second night one snapped , and the following night another snapped . All were baited with peanut butter ( the same brand ) . I can say that this is much safer than the snap traps , having almost snapped my fingers more than once . Other than that , there is n't much to say . I think it is an expensive product that does not do what it is supposed to do , at least for me . Out of all the traps I have used , the snap traps have been great.I also have an electric trap that is amazing , but it was VERY expensive becuase it will kill a large rat ! So far , for me , nothing beats a snap trap ... .just watch your fingers . Of course , I do not have pets , and I do n't put them where my kids can get at them . If this would have caught ANYTHING , I might have given it a better rating , but as it stands , I can not . I will keep it baited ( with fresh peanut better ) and I will report back if things change , but I 'm not holding my breath .	-1
I have set thousands of mouse traps over the years , and am a firm believer that the `` traditional model '' has proved itself as a tried and true tool . I have no problems looking into alternatives , however , and have had fun over the years catching mice of different species in everything from Sherman traps to a neat PETA- sponsored live trap ( worked great ) .This trap , the Victor Tri-kill Moue Trap , is headed for the trash . It 's not that it ca n't catch a mouse . It can . After the first mouse , the trap is jerked around and moved away from its original placement . Since mice are very neophobic , best success is for traps to be set right next to baseboards or known traveling lanes . So I do n't like that the trap moves from where I want it to be . Second , the spring is just weak . A traditional snap trap kills by causing extreme damage to a mouse , hopefully on the head and neck . This trap seems to ... strangle mice ? Are n't we past this level of revenge ? Finally , the trap is not robust in its construction . One of the panels fell off as I was resetting it ! A traditional snap trap is a much better , predictable , and reliable purchase .	-1
The idea behind this mouse trap is impressive -- make three entryways for the mice so that even if they scurry past one side of it , they 'll be suckered in by the smell wafting through the door on the other side . Well ... that did n't happen , despite having this set up in my garage for the past few weeks . I know there are mice in there because I can hear them . They must be laughing together over a few beers at the Hole in the Wall Bar at how ridiculous this baiter is.The trap itself is pretty much a no-brainer . You paste your peanut butter onto the plate , make sure all the doors are shut tight , and put it near a spot mice frequent ( like right outside that Hole in the Wall Bar ) . If you think the bait has gotten a bit old , you can just wash it out under the faucet and paste some new stuff on.One plus on this trap is that the springs are all inside the trap , so it seems safe enough to leave around pets . Another plus is that there are no chemicals involved , and it definitely looks like it will kill quickly . Our mice seem to be smarter than the average critters , so perhaps we should just swap out the peanut butter for a smear of Guinness froth and catch some leprechauns instead.There is a 30 day warranty with this thing , and you 're supposed to see the most mice caught on day 1 , so even if this trap disappoints you as much as it did me , you can still get your money back .	-1
After over a year , I have n't caught a single mouse , however in the same time I 've caught about five mice with conventional snap-traps . The bait was n't even touched ! My hypothesis is that they ca n't smell the bait or are too timid to poke their head into the noose part of the trap.I even had the tri-kill out with NO snap traps for a good month , during that time there was clear evidence of mice , so I finally re-deployed the snap traps after which I caught two mice in quick succession.Sorry , but 2 stars until it catches somebody.Original review below ... Here in Michigan the local field mice come into your garage every winter and eat up your grass seed and anything that 's even slightly edible.The end of fall / start of winter is the peak where I can fill 2-3 mouse traps every other day . I tried a `` Nooski '' trap recently but was n't entirely impressed . It was less prone to accidental release , but was moer tricky to set.This is almost foolproof - you press the three arrows down and it 's set . When it 's tripped the arrow pops back up.One concern I have is that this has an internal bar which comes up to grab and kill the mouse . My experience is that in cold weather the mouse can `` Freeze '' to the bar on a conventional trap making it hard to clear . This strikes me as being worse since it 's a fairly narrow loop.Since it 's the end of winter , no mice caught yet . My neighbor has also been letting his cat roam so that 's probably been a factor . Will update later ... .	-1
This grill is new for 2013 and it was very easy to assemble . All the parts were in the box and there was n't any damage . I cooked chicken and steak on it the first night and it worked Okay . I bought a aftermarket grill 2 years ago and it leaked grease all over my deck plus it did n't cook evenly and had hot and cold spots so I went back to a Weber because we could afford it this year . My last Weber lasted 10 years and I ca n't imagine why this one would n't do the same . The Stainless is heavy duty and I like that the propane tank is hidden behind the door and out of site . The small foot print is a plus but not the reason I bought the grill it 's simply because there are only two of use now and serves our purpose . Update 5/18/13 I have cooked several times and the grill is not heating very well . The cross over tube flame is red not blue and cooking times have decreased . I called Weber and there going to send a new burner and we will see if it solved the problem . I will update when I replace the parts . Update 5/26/2013 I have installed the new burner tubes and had a party this weekend and it took over one hour to cook thin burgers . This is the worst grill I have ever owned . Weber is sending a rep to see if it can be fixed but at this point I just want them to do the right thing and take it back before the summer is over . Update 5/28/2013 Lowe 's has a 90 day return policy so I took it back and ordered a Genesis S-310 three burner with 38,000 BTU . I have to wait two weeks for the order so I hope it 's worth it .	-1
This is my second Weber purchase ( Genesis was the first ) . Based on the Consumer Reports review I purchased this blindly . It is a low end version of the Genesis . The major bummer was that it came with dents in just about every part of the grill . It was especially bad in the hood where it was very visible . I wished I had purchased it locally so that I could return it . After the grill was out of the box and spread out on my deck the `` genie was out of the bottle '' and I put it together.Lastly , it is smaller than most three burner grills . With a family of 5 and the need to grill pizza , it has a small surface size that we could have worked with but not the size I expected.It was very easy to put together if you are worried about that . It took about 2 hours.My last review , I gave my Genesis 5 stars ... Would definitely not buy Spirit again .	-1
I like the way new Weber kettle grills cook . Unfortunately , the long term durability is poor . The grates are cheap , the porcelin finish on both my grills was flawed and cracked , and corrosion and rust take this grill to the curbside prematurely.. For the money , you are better off to buy a $ 50 Charbroil grill . I live on the coast and my Webers rusted straight away . I bought a Stok grill for less than the cost of the TOL Weber and so far , no rust or corrosion ... ..plus I have cast Iron grates instead of the caot hanger style grates that come with the Weber . The Stok also comes with other handy accessories like a charcoal starter that lets you avoid charcoal lighter fluid entirely.Follow up : My Weber grills took a beating due to inadequate packaging systems . This likely contributed to damage of the handle attachment points and the corrosion that was able to exploit the damaged areas . The marine environment I live in can be harsh on any metal that is not protected .	-1
This product sounded like a great idea to me . Be prepared that it is cheaply made enamel finished metal with sharp edges . It is so small that you wo n't be able to smoke a decent sized piece of meat . You may be able to do a couple of chicken breasts or pork chops , but that 's about it . There is a grate that fits over the basket , which would allow you to cook a somewhat larger piece of meat , but it does n't fit unless you keep the basket inside , which cramps the wood chips . This is contrary to the instruction manual , which really does n't give many instructions . It just shows diagrams of the cooker . It would be nice to have a few recipes of cooking suggestions . This item is definitely not up to Charbroil 's normal standards .	-1
Nice pan but its so small that its useless for anything but to throw some veggies in . For a family of four like ours , that 's really even pushing it.I was so disappointed with this because I was really looking forward to using it . It would be great if it was just bigger .	-1
This device is nothing more than a pan and is not something I would use often . I had Charbroil 's Inferred grill and that was a big mistake . This continues the mistake on a Weber . Inferred to Charbroil is nothing but a pan between the flames to eliminate the flame . Wow , now there is a concept . It is all hype as far as I am concerned and not too useful . Use a low priced pyrex roaster or a low metal pan and you will get the same thing for much less and probably much easier to clean and store . This probably wo n't burn through as fast as the Charbroil grill . I was skeptical and my fears were confirmed . Sorry , I find it a dumb product which is not needed . It is in the garage already . Like the Beatles sang `` I should have known better '' .	-1
I looked forward to receiving this item but my hopes were pretty much dashed when I opened the box.First of all , it is very cheaply made with rough metal edges . I did n't find any that were sharp enough to cut me but the potential is there . What is with the lid not having a handle of any kind ? Be prepared to use a spatula or fork to clumisly remove the lid when you want to check your food . As far as I 'm concerned that is a big omission.Inside the unit , do n't expect to cook large volumes . The inside is big enough for one steak or two petite cuts . Two or three chicken breasts will fill this one to capacity . If you 're thinking of smoking a small roast , it better be pretty small . A boneless pork loin might fit but most likely you will need to cut off one end or cut it in half.Charbroil does include some wood chips with the infusion cooker so you wo n't need to run out to buy some to try this out . Following directions and putting them in the proper place it seemed I needed to heat my grill to a temperature higher than I normally use . Plus getting 4 big burners going to cook with this unit is quite a drain on the propane vs. the achieved results.My test food was a thick , stuffed pork chop which barely fit in the cooking chamber . Keeping all four burners going at about 3/4 capacity I was able to achieve a good tastiing meal . There was some smoke flavor but not near as much as if I were to use either my electric smoker or scatter wood chips above the burners . it did however seem to keep the pork chop moister than if cooked directly on the grill for a longer period of time ( infusion ? ) .In conclusion , I 'll keep this around and perhaps use it every now and then when grilling just for myself but it is far from being my favorite tool to use on the grill . It is hampered by being cheaply made , inconvenient to use ( no handle on lid for example ) , a marginal design and small interior space .	-1
