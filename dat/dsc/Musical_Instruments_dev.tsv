What a good buy ! This gig bag is nicely made , looks great , and the padding is really nice . Luv the zip pocket in the front - perfect for strap , snark , capo , whatever . Bought this for my hubby 's tenor uke and one just like it ( 'tho smaller ) for my concert uke . Highly recommend .	1
yes , a iittle white flaking but no biggie unless you have a black case interior ... easy to install strap locks ... use on blue strat and looks great..enjoy	1
Bought several of these and they worked fine . I later moved on to Planet Waves for my custom pedal board because I could get the lengths perfect .	1
Looks great , feels great , and works great ! The leather is soft and adjusts to the contour of my shoulder and back comfortably and securely . great ! I love it !	1
I did n't know a little battery powered amp could sound so good . It sounds just as good if not better than my Roland Cube 20 , of course without the effects and such , but still , a great little amp for practice and a little gig with family and friends . Puts out pretty good power for a little 5w . Has a great sound in my opinion .	1
I have owned many delay pedals in the past several decades.I like this one the best ... especially for the price range.Boss DD-7 beats the pants off the Line 6 Echo Park delay . The Echo Park delay causes a little noise/interference when not used , being caused by the little LED light flashing ... you can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp . The Boss DD-7 was perfectly clean and did not alter the tone.Many great features including an on-the-fly sampler/looper.The ability to control it with an external pedal/switch.Easy to set and adjust while playing live and on-the-fly.Matches perfectly with other Boss pedals.Standard `` Built Like A Tank '' Boss construction is renowned for.It also beats the other Boss Delay pedals available for quality , sound and features.Many options , settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatile.I bought this for quality , ease of use and straightforward operation while playing live.It also `` self-oscillates & freaks out '' quite well . ( If you 're into that sort of thing ! ) Make sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual . There are `` new '' operations and ways to `` set '' this pedal up to perform certain functions .	1
Easy to put together , stable and cheap . 100 % would recommend . I want to get more guitar , just to get a other one .	1
String trees are a great inexpensive way to upgrade your standard tele or strat with accessories found on more expensive or custom shop instruments . Just remember you will have to drill for the guide posts .	1
Simple and compact.No clicking or buzzing.Perfect for old Van Halen solos like in & # 34 ; You Really Got Me. & # 34 ; Plus , you can get a swooshing bright sound you ca n't get with a Flange and Chorus when backing it down and playing clean.Play some old KISS or some Rob Zombie. $ 65 bucks is expensive but a true analog phaser is n't available in most amp emulators. & # 34 ; You know your man is working hard ... he 's worth a deuce ! & # 34 ;	1
I was surprised of how well this stand is made . It 's worth $ 45 easily . I ; ve used stands for over 27 years and this is the best I ; ve owned !	1
I bought these picks because I liked the color of the picks.These picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are . I play guitar everyday for around 3-5 hours a day and I have yet to break one of these picks . Very nice quality and very cool color to them . They are also priced very good.Much cheaper buying them here at amazon instead of a quarter a piece at the guitar store . Recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar . Additionally , they are very fast at shipping them to your door . Three days after ordering them they were sitting on my door step .	1
I sprayed on all my guitars . No problem with any chemical reactions . It polished the body of the glossy guitars up like new . Now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice . It must be from a product like this . They seriously look brand new . Makes nicks and scratches less noticeable . If you want a nice looking guitar for the stage or display , this stuff works .	1
plugged it in and it works to connect a mono line out to the stereo input on a Lepai amp . not much else I can tell you	1
I typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars . they work very well for my needs . however , I bought a junker bass for outdoor gigs and to play at places where i do n't care what happens to the gear . This strap is perfect for those needs . A nice nylon and the lock works wellBUTthe locking portion might be a little thick for some strap buttons . It works on the bass i use it on , but not my Gibson SG , so be aware . I would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap .	1
It does a fantastic job . I 've had it for almost a year now , still works as well as the first day . Perfect condition .	1
Not much to say about a chrome neckplate - it 's largely a cosmetic item . But my old one ( with the serial number ) was corroding pretty bad , and I liked the look of the new one . A few people have mentioned that it 's thinner , but assuming you also have the `` pad '' underneath ( which you should ) that was not a problem for me at all . Anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws . Installation took all of 5 minutes and the neck is set up exactly as it was before . Looks great !	1
as another guy said & # 34 ; how could i live without this pedal before ? & # 34 ; i agree with that , i got two of these , one for my base guitar , one for my guitar.simply outstanding , simply the best . thank u mxr !	1
Right out of the box this guitar was flawless . I played it with the strings it came with ( to inspect intonation-fret buzz etc . the old strings would work for set-up if needed ) and the intonation ( harmonics at the 12 fret exactly matched the fretted note at the 12th fret ) was dead on . Absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret . I have been playing guitar for 40 years and I have seen my fair share of acoustic guitars in that time . To say this is a beautiful playing and sounding instrument just does n't do it justice . I have played many expensive acoustic guitars that did n't sound or play as well as this even after set-up . The lows are nice and clear and the highs are clear without sounding `` tinny '' or banjo like . A very well built , great sounding guitar . For the price you ca n't go wrong . I would recommend this guitar to novices and pros . I was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price . 100 % satisfied . Rock on Jasmine ! !	1
I 've had one of these for about 2 years now . I 've made 100 's of picks out of old credit cards , gift cards , club cards , plastic sheets , plastic packaging well you get the idea . THis is fun and easy to do . I have even sold the picks at garage sales ( 25 cents each ) . My favorite cards to use are the iTunes gift cards ( careful cause some of the iTunes cards are cardstock ) . They most replicate a Fender Med . pick . Most credit cards are a bit thicker ( somewhere between a Fender Med . and Heavy ) . THey work well also ( the edges do come out a little rough but I use an old emery board to clean them up quickly and easily ) . I use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results . The best part is I am NEVER without a pick ( even when people accidentally walk off with one . ) I do get funny looks at the stores when I ask for the used gift cards back ( until I explain what I do with them- then the clerks are like & # 34 ; wow thats so cool & # 34 ; ) . On average I can get 5 picks from a credit card ( unless I 'm going for a particular part of the card with a design on it ) . It takes a little thought to get the most out of the cards- but seeing as they are basically free I do n't mind & # 34 ; wasting & # 34 ; parts if I want a particular image . Just a word of caution on things like DVDs or CDs- they are really too thick and tend to shatter- not worth the effort ( I tried an old aol cd and only got one usable pick out of 8 punches )	1
I recently bought these for my home studio , so far so good , keyboards to mixer . They are a little flimsy , but so far no problems , have extras if necessary , high end cables also break down . They were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus . For the price and selection and results , works for me .	1
A great add on to my student model for acoustic practising . Always add those rubber gasket strap stops too . Fender makes good cheap ones . Guitar will never fall off a strap .	1
It 's good . Was having a lot of feedback and got tired of taping a make shift sound hole cover . Recommended .	1
These Elixir Nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time ( months ) unlike other guitar strings . Great product . These Extra Light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment , so instead I buy Elixir Nanoweb strings in singles so I can select the gauges that I like even better . A great product no matter what gauge string you choose .	1
I admit I got this from Guitar Center on clearance , but over the past week or so I 've had it , I just love plugging into it . I 've got a great vintage larger amp , but would rather not lug it around for just small practice sessions , and I 'm anticipating spending some time in apartment living , so I was looking for a small , tube-based amp . This thing gives great tone with both a Strat and a Les Paul clone , and an overdrive pedal works very well with it . Of course it 's not too loud - that 's the whole point ! I should note that turned on it has a hum that my other amps do n't have , but it 's really low volume . Also , the tubes do take a minutes to warm up , and since it does n't have a standby switch , you just have to turn down the volume knob before plugging in . But it just is great stuff to plug into something with solid tone without having to burn my ears ( or those of anyone else ) . Great little amp .	1
bought this on a whim and I am glad of it , I have not used the string winder part yet but the cutter makes short work of both guitar and mandolin strings without the risk of marring the head , just be careful you can pinch yourself if you are not careful .	1
Not much to say here . I have a bad habit of putting picks in my mouth and chewing on them , effectively destroying them , but with these , I do n't know what they 've done and put on the surface of these things , but it is gross . Haha , it killed my bad habit of chewing on picks .	1
I use Fender strings and I have used many other brands as well . I like Nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound . I change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit I can go 2 to 3 weeks for hard playing.I started using Fender strings with the Stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat . They sounded great . I use these for my telecaster in 10 -46 ( factory spec ) and they are real nice too.I do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets . I have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period . Stick to nickel and you will be glad you did !	1

DI bass is the worst . Just really , really awful . Every ordinary DI box I 've tried yields this thin , cheap treble sound that does not present my bass in its most flattering light . So when I started playing live weekly , I just hauled my bass amp around to each gig , because it was out of the question that I would rely on a weird sounding DI box to carry the day.I live in Phoenix . I made it through about two months of lugging a monstrous bass amp across town in 115 degree weather before I decided there had to be another way.When I first got this pedal , I would run it parallel with the amp , terrified to rely entirely on this little box for my sound . After a few performances , I let go and left the amp at home . The Bass Attack pedal did not disappoint . Ever since , I just bring a bass and this pedal . Running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound . I do n't miss the amp at all.I did spend an entire evening the night this pedal arrived , just tweaking knobs until it was perfect . You 'll want to dial in exactly the right sound for your bass , and some of the settings I tried were less than ideal for my instrument . But once I got it locked in , I 've never touched the knobs again . I just plug in and everything sounds magical .	1
I have gone through a lot of stands and this one for the money is Great . As a matter of fact , I ordered 2 more . Get this one and have No Regrets ... ... ..	1
I had bought an SN2 and love it but I found it had a little trouble recognizing the low E on my bass . This handles bass tuning much better . The lit display is great for tuning on stage , and because it works on vibration you do n't need to worry about muting when you are tuning.I also find it very accurate . I would have given it 5 stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks . This is probably the seller and not the manufacturer .	1
Being a studio owner I did n't buy this for stage work . Being a player of multiple stringed instruments for decades I 've had many different tuners including real strobes . So when I picked this up about 8 months ago it was because I needed one where I was at and right now.I do n't know about the +/- .1 % accuracy but the pegs and my ear tell me it 's quite accurate , enough that I can find notes up and down the neck that are slightest bit out of tune when using it . By using a transformer adapter and a stage mic it also works very well for acoustic instruments.I 'm still using the replacement battery I put in about 6 months ago but I just use it and unplug . It 's travelled with me a few times and airport security finds it an interesting thing for me to have in a carry on but it almost seems durable enough to drop from 35,000 feet and continue working.I was shocked by how well it works . I was shocked by the fact that I could spend so little and get a real tuner and not a device that gets you close . Highly recommended .	1
Cheaply made but functional . Keep a couple of these in the bag as spares.They will be handy if you- know- who shows up to the gig without a strap .	1
Lemon has been known for quite some generations to be a good cleaning solvent because of its acidic nature and this certainly does the job . As the label warns : do NOT to use on Maple-wood frets ( mostly Fender strats ) due to the softer & lighter quality . It is only for the harder , darker woods like mahogany ( which I have ) or ebony ( high quality - i.e . expensive - used best for fretless ) . The solution is perfect , but the applicator ( attached to the neck of the bottle ) could be better . I would rather take the neck applicator out and apply lightly using a 100 % cotton cloth.This solution has been made specifically for use on guitars , though I think you could find a similar lemon oil cleaner cheaper at local stores . It 's only 4-oz , but what little is used each time , this bottle should last the guitar owner his/her life .	1
After registering the amp online ( or by mail ) you have access to 500+ backing tunes , with either drums or drums and bassline . You are able to select from different genres such as Rock , Blues , Country , Alternative and more . Along with this great feature , you can also take free lessons , from beginner to advanced . You can even get custom settings , giving you the sound of such great bands as Green Day , The Beatles , Led Zeppelin and many more . Along with lessons , tabs , and the ability to loop any Jam Track , Spider Online adds more than even I immagined to this awesome amp ! ! If you 're still hesitant about buying this or any other Spider amp , just buy it . I personally guarantee your satisfaction ... BUY IT ! ! ( no seriously , are you buying it ? ? )	1
These pedal cables are of superior quality at a reasonable price . Well-designed and reliable , I highly recommend these . Thanks to Amazon for offering this great product .	1
Great EXTRA Light POLYWEB strings for guitar . Really impressed with the PolyWeb ! These are easy on my fingers and the polyweb do n't sqeek .	1
absolutely no problems well built very steady and easy to carry with you . I will get another for my monitor .	1
Great strings and they seem to hold their sound a long while . I & # 8217 ; m not sure why a few people are putting these strings down ; I & # 8217 ; ve used them numerous times without any issues . They last as long and sound as good as any other brands I & # 8217 ; ve played .	1
I bought these because they were an & # 34 ; add-on & # 34 ; offer and I 'm glad I did . I do n't play uke but a friend turned me on to using them for bass . These are a little too soft for guitar ( check out the Dunlops ) but I 'm going to make sure I have some of these around , too .	1
if you can drill into wood with a 5/8 wood drill bit then these are for you , I bought mine for an amp 1/4 stack and now when I record I can simple roll the head and Cabinet into the small room and record ... you get 4 in the package with 4 wheels and 4 retainers thats 5/8 & # 34 ; thick that goes into the wood of a cabinet ... .	1
Definitely the best combination of price , durability and sound quality that I 've come across . Plus , the tweed look really grows on you . Ordered a bunch for the studio , and a bunch more for home . Holds up well , even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on . Do it !	1
this is the one that everyone told me I should use , being new to guitar I figured one polish ( car ) has to work well , that was very incorrect on my part , this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes	1
Our teenager really likes these . As a beginner guitar player he likes the variety and was able to find out what types of picks he prefers . Have not broken one yet .	1
These are great little tuners ! You can leave them clamped on your instrument and make spot adjustments on the fly , which is especially helpful when you 're breaking in strings or any time . I 've played guitar a long time and ukulele is fairly recent , and it seems that maybe their shorter strings are somehow more susceptible to influences like temperature fluctuation or just vigorous strumming.SO , these are perfect accompanists for your virtuosic efforts .	1
For the price , this lil guy does the job . I got this to add to my pedal board and it seems to do a good job boosting the mids and highs that seem to get lost in the pedals and cables . The pedal is somewhat cheaply made , the jacks do n't really seem to fit the housing so well , but i do have it somewhat semi-permanently fixed to the board so i do not think that this will be an issue .	1
Not bad at all , this unit tunes really well , same as the Boss original , the only difference is that this one takes like 1 sec to respond after the pedal is activated , the Boss is instantaneous , other than that both units behave exactly the same . Some criticize this brand for making cheap clones but the truth is that they are making musicians on a budget a great favor , for those of you who do not want to spend $ 100 on a tuner this one is just perfect ; since I am a collector I have other brands to compare ( Boss , Korg , Fender ... ) and it is the same thing , it is as accurate as the Boss , at least mine is , and is a good mute switch also , I am happy with mine ... .	1
This is NOT my first guitar . Nor am I breathless Epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of Taylors and Martins . It 's not . Here 's what it is : An exceedingly well-constucted , AMAZINGLY playable guitar . Fit , finish , feel and action were all VERY nice ... Sound on the other hand ? Let 's face it . It 's plywood all around . It SOUNDS like plywood . But that does n't distract from the fact that it 's a great guitar for $ 100 bucks.It 's a fine & # 34 ; first & # 34 ; guitar . It 's a great beach/camping/cabin guitar . Leave it in your car to practice at lunch . Leave it in the office . ANY guitar is better than no guitar ... And this guitar is better than a LOT of other entry level guitars.Seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box ... New , premium strings DO make a difference.If your expectations are for a playable , rugged , affordable guitar you wo n't be disappointed . If sound quality is your primary concern , well ... You are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy.For my desired application , this guitar was great ... I 'm very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat .	1
Although this is hardly a high-end microphone , it is fully functional for amplification of voice or an instrument , although the output signal seems like it could be stronger . The stand is sturdy , too . So , this is probably not the best choice for the full-time professional musician , but for busking around or playing in clubs , it 's worth a look .	1
Herco is a Jim Dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile . Dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part . I wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood . I have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist . The product came fast and the instructions are straight forward . I may order another if this one performs well .	1
These are good picks , I 've tried all the other gel pick 's and plastic pick 's , The gel pick 's come close , But these are great , Because I have Dexterity Problem 's , and the plastic/rubber grip Is perfect ... ... ... ... I do still have a little Trouble with controlled the pick and droping the pick but they definitely do help.I def Do recommend these to anyone who was deceased/bad dexterity .	1
Works great , sounds great , it 's a bit on the large side but is solidly built and simple to operate . Tascam rocks .	1
Not sure why Behringer gets a bad rep - this is compact , works as advertised , is affordable and an all around handy thing for the musician.Well built , solid construction - zero complaints .	1
For the dollar its the best and biggest bang for the buck . My daughters love this amp and works perfect . Product is as described .	1
I was a bit skeptical about buying this , but after reading the reviews I thought why not . It is actually a good little practice amp . I 'm still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood . It gives me the portability I needed to move about my house . I was using a mixer that 's hooked to one of my PCs and using that sound card for sound . That works great , but sometimes I do n't want to be tied down to the PC . I use the PC arrangement for recording and the amp for private relaxing guitar playing wherever I want to have it . I recommend this little amp wholeheartedly . Just be mindful that it is n't a $ 500 Marshall amp , but it does well in a pinch .	1
Just as the others have said . Its cheap with little to no padding but gets the job done as a dust cover and if you need something handy to transport your bass to and from gigs or to put the bass into storage.Its a perfect fit for Fender Squire J Bass . I also got my Samick CR-13 short scale to fit in there but it was a tight fit so not the ideal choice for Short Scale bassesBut Im happy with it for under eleven bucks it gets the job done and I would buy it again	1
Pros : -Solid build quality-Included flight case , mic clips , and adapters ( 3/8 & # 34 ; female threads to 5/8 & # 34 ; male threads ) -Clean audio-Great for live sound eventsCons : -Limited upper frequency response -- this is to be expected in almost all dynamic mics .	1
Strong folds nice to bring it with you on a job . The price was right . May buy another for a spare .	1
Have these on my Tele , very interesting to play around with . I bought the regular gauge first and usually use pink slinkeys on all my electrics , the regular chromes where like telephone wires compared to my regular gauge so I bought these instead . These were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys . They still are heavier and you can really feel it when bending but they add a completely different feel to playing guitar and your tone . When playing these I tend to play more sixties inspired , the flats help capture that surf guitar tone which is really cool . I really like them but they are completely different and I would n't recommend them to everyone . As far as CQ goes these are great , no problems , feel great , sound great .	1
If you are a broke performer of harmonica blues and need to get back on track , these will not help much . That being said , these are not junk , nor are they cheap nasty instruments - there are plenty available that are much worse than these . Straight from the case , these do n't bend well , but do not despair . Having an experienced player break them in gets one of them behaving well in a couple of days ( about eight hours of playing ) So far I have persuaded the G A Bb and C to bend enough to satisfy curiosity , but they will not hold up to serious playing . I do not destroy my harps easily , so am not the most aggressive player out there , but I felt like these would certainly be something even I may wear out pretty quickly . For the purpose I intended these to perform they are about perfect - with me breaking them in , I can pass them on to my non harp playing relative for them to learn the basics . Better use these inexpensive harps to over-blow and squawk through , than the set I will be buying in six months ; if the promise of musical ability follows through . The advantage of the plastic comb is that I do n't need to pass on any germs with them - they wash very easily , with no damage . For the price , you get seven good harps , that make presentable learner instruments , with just a little prep . Without the experienced blues player to break them in , it will take a bit of patience to learn bending on them - there are many YouTube videos that will teach the method , so try hard , persevere and you will crack it with these harps - try learning bending on the lower key instruments first ; they will be easier .	1
This is a great little keyboard for use with GarageBand on the iPad . GarageBand recognizes it as a controller for the Keyboard , Smart Keyboard , Sampler , Smart Guitar , Smart Bass , and Drums . You can even solo on the Akai keyboard while the Smart Keyboard autoplays an accompaniment ! In addition to offering the superior feel of a real keyboard , this Akai keyboard has much more consistent touch sensitivity than what 's built into GarageBand for iPad.Unlike other keyboard controllers I 've tried , this one plugs and plays with the iPad -- no powered USB hub required . ( You do need Apple 's Camera connection Kit , of course , to add a USB port to your iPad . ) It 's not loaded with gimmicks -- just the essentials , and the essentials work very well indeed . The keys are 85 % of standard width , which is large enough for fumble-free playing . It 's lightweight , compact and thus perfectly suited as an iPad accessory .	1
I bought this to try out on my baritone uke.It works great and is very easy to use.I use it with my Fender Mustang.I had no problem with the suction cup except on the rougher face of my Martin DX1.I was able to attach it to the smoother HPL back and sides using the suction cup.I wet it before attaching.You could also use a small clamp , blue painters tape , etc. , for trouble mounting.It could be used on just about any instrument . Some may need a clamp.It picks up anything it is attached to.It will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp.Pretty cool.Nice price .	1
I already liked the Jazz 3 picks by Dunlop , these made from the Ultex material sound so much better , and the surface of the pick is nice , even with sweaty fingers , they stay put . I do pick scrapes alot and there is no sign of wear on the edges of the pick . Sweet ! ! ! ! ! These are clear yellow picks I would love to see them in red , that would be brutal ! ! ! !	1
I was impressed by the quality of this product . It is simple and does its job well . Easy to release and will work with a fat neck acoustic or Les Paul or with a thin neck on most metal Guitars . Holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise . Was a great value .	1
1 Digital Drumset , 1 Electronic guitar , 1 microphone ( non XLR ) , and a Keyboard . I got the Brady Bunch Musical here . This mixer works great . No complaints , just works ! All connections are 1/4 '' mono .	1
OK , so they are just screws ... ... . but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one ! ! ! And it is fender licensed !	1
Made of leather or high-quality pleather , so it seems built-to-last . I use it on my Seagull and it totally works great . I would definitely recommend , but it 's kind of expensive for what it is .	1
I ca n't do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer ( FOX ) . If you have n't started in the mic-collecting business , trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below , you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one . I 've always wondered why I ca n't reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet , and I finally realize it 's because they have the Shure SM7B and I don't.It enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives ( face it , those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use ) . It 's very directional and `` selective '' ( rejecting room ambience and background noise ) , so it 's perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications . But for announcing , broadcasting , vocal performance and vocal recording , I do n't see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it .	1
Hm . I received this . I opened this . I 've used it . I also use it . This product seems to be a pretty good product .	1
I have used monster cables for years , and with good reason . The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone . Simple fact : cables break , but getting to replace them at no cost is where it 's at .	1
The tuner is great - seems very accurate and senses all the notes with ease . my only complaint is the little kickstand on the back , does n't hold it at an angle that i find very usable . otherwise ? a fine product that i expect to last for years . korg makes great tuners . i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus . if any of the three of them were to ever be lost or stolen , i 'd replace them in a heartbeat with exactly the same models .	1
I purchased this to use until I get the replacement to my Ovation CC28 and it is load and clean . For $ 20.00 it is worth all day .	1
I use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic ( a cheap SM58 wannabe from Radio Shack ) . I like how I can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use , but then I can easily position for use with a generous 16 inch reach . Definitely can not use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk , but a clamping mount works very well . The locking clutch is excellent , with a large nob and secure teeth . The smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient . Just what I needed .	1
I use these patch cables on my pedal board and they save valuable space . They work well and I have n't had any problems with any of them shorting out or making static or other noises . I highly recommend them . Plus , they look nice , unlike the various colors that come with the bulkier , cheaper 1 ' cords .	1
It has a 1950 's slap back echo Its good for the price No putting It down for Sounding bad as with most Danelecto products and probably higher price and lower price products used the same circuits . If You want something that Is just reverb without all the slap back then Behringer DR600 which I use for Vocal for Guitar I use RV600 which has space verb and ducking also called shimmer .	1
I love it , I used this for my Yamaha ypt-230 and it works great , I would recommend it to anyone	1
I use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it . A day does n't go by where the stand is not in use .	1
These are amazing little inexpensive mixers . If you need to sum together some signals this can get the job done.We have two of these in our vocal effects rack summing our effects from six feeds ( three per mixer ) down to two outputs ( one per mixer ) , the mixers feed direct boxes which go back to the front of house console , this lets us have the effects on stage so the performers can control them and send the signal back to the console for adding into the main mix . We have no noise problems at all with these mixers and they really solved a problem for me , I needed tiny flexible mixers I could preset and fit inside the rack out of the way , not only were these extremely inexpensive they work great.Good luck and good music to all	1
My kid is happy with this strap for his guitar . He did have to widen the hole a bit in order to fit the strap over the peg on the bottom of his guitar , but ever since he got it on he 's been very pleased . He especially likes the colors .	1
I 've had this pedal since the mid-90 's , when I started playing in my teens . While an EQ might seem like an odd choice for a beginner 's pedal selection , I was mainly trying to compensate for the crappy bass and mid-range of the cheap CRATE and Marshall amps I used back then . Since I have better equipment now , I have n't used it as much.However , as simple as it is , it is definitely a useful tool . You can leave it on all the time to mold your sound with greater detail than most amps would have with knobs . Or , you can the on-board volume to crank up the volume for solos or louder parts.The only negatives I recall from using it were that it added a bit of a hissing noise ( but not so much that you could n't trap it with a noise gate ) , and it seemed to take away from the sustain of notes just a bit . Again , nothing that ca n't be fixed with other effects . And if you think about how important equalization is with stereo equipment , it only makes sense that you might want that level of control in a guitar amp as well.I give it 5* despite the minor flaws because it does what it says and BOSS products are built rock solid . I 'll have this thing forever .	1
I ordered these because I wanted to deck the tremolo on my Strats because I do n't really use the trem . I have a modern American Standard and an American Vintage Reissue Hot Rod 62 Strat . There are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as I can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black . My Standard now has 3 black and 2 silver springs but the 62 Hot Rod has 5 of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with . Easy to install and works like a charm .	1
very good pedal for the price I have bought other behringer pedals that work very well will be buying more from them	1
Try to get the version w/the black cabinet for around $ 300 as that 's what most major music stores are charging . In any case , I was really looking more for a twin 12 '' speaker to pair with an amp head but those can cost as much , if not more , than this combo ! The clean side of the amp is exactly that - very very clean . This amp has tons of power to spare . In your house you do not have or want to turn it up beyond 3 . Ca n't even imagine what the 8 or 9 might be like . I have my own separate effects stomp box so I can let this amp sound like almost ANYTHING . The big plus here is that unlike with real tube amps that need to be cranked up pretty much to get the right sound , here you can have it set on 2 and still get pretty much any amp sound ( I am using a ZOOM MS50G ) . All in all hard to beat , for practice session as well as small to mid size gigs . Only thing I miss a bit is a headphone jack .	1
Got this to put into my Pseudo-caster project guitar . Love it ! Be warned , it does NOT come with springs , claw or trem bar . If you order this , get the tremolo bar for the Mexican model . The threads are smaller on these.If you like to do & # 34 ; dive bombs & # 34 ; , you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block . It will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness.Last important note ... Make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance . If it matches spec on this Trem , all the screw holes will match up .	1
I have now purchased 3 of these guitar straps for my main guitars . I absolutely love them ! Great quality , very strong , and great variation of length on them . They are also very wide which is very nice on the shoulders . I highly recommend this strap !	1
I have always used tortex picks . I like them a lot and they last forever ( almost : ) these were a little thick for my tastes . The red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns.If you like a medium thick pick though , these are rockin .	1
I have two sets of these for my straps . The push button action is most convenient vs. fighting stubborn leather openings , especially if new . The gold finish matches my instrument 's hardware and they are sturdy and durable . Works for me !	1
So far the ones I have used have all threaded nicely into our 16u rack . There are exactly as described and do the job . What more can a guy say about a little box of screws ? Maybe I should post some pics of the little buggers in action ?	1
I enjoy using it and its helpful when you wan na use it to hold up your sheet music to a viewable point and your books too ! I recommend it !	1
Be aware that when the boom is extended between the tripod stance that it can be a little tippy . Other than that , , , , , , , , , an excellent value	1
My son plays electric and acoustic guitar . He uses Elixir for both and swears by them . He has had other brands , but they just do n't stand up to elixir .	1
These Fender Locking Tuners are the best for Stratocaster guitars , mainly if you have a tremolo system , what helps a lot the tuning stability and speeds up the strings change .	1
Not bad , but I had intended on leaving this on my instrument . I bought a few for different basses and guitars . But the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag ( no problem with hard cases ) leaving the battery dead when I took the instrument out of the case . The switch SHOULD be on the side of the unit . FWIW , I like my Snarks better ... faster and more stable tuning . A near miss with the NS .	1
Bought this to use on my 1962 Strat Reissue . After a year or so of playing the rosewood fretboard become a little dried out and rough , of course covered with 100+ hours of grime and sweat . This kit has everything you need to make your guitar feel , look , and play like new . I put new strings on after using this and man ! Felt just like the day it arrived from the factory . Can slide and play much smoother with this . Serious speed improvement .	1
As accurate and easy to use as the excellent Korg DT-10 , I plugged in the battery , hooked up my guitar ( which I had just tuned using a Korg DT-10 that I already own ) and it came up in meter mode and verified exactly the tuning that the DT-10 gave me ! I love it ! Nice footprint , very easy to see the indicators in a bright room or on a darkened stage , one input 1/4 & # 34 ; jack on the right , one output 1/4 & # 34 ; jack on the left . Simple to use . I probably will never use the other three display modes , but it 's nice tht they are there if I want to play with them . The perfect tuner .	1
Very nice , smooth , no sharp edges , not much bigger than the picks it 's holding ( it holds about 10 of my favorite thin Mel Bay picks ) ... the only issue is , the spring clip that pushes the picks to the top , is a little too strong , and was warping my thin picks , but I just put one very stiff pick at the bottom of the pile , and it 's fine .	1
It helps to clean the guitar . I have an eletric acoustic guitar and it was a good choice to buy this !	1
I have many Planet Waves cables . They are all very well made . I like the molded ends that seem to help prevent shorts . An excellent value . I would highly recommend .	1
Nothing fancy about this strap , unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end . Just well made and functional.I got this for my grandson 's Squier ( by Fender ) 3/4 size acoustic . It does n't have a strap button at the top end . It would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut . But I work with leather and I found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose . Not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand .	1
Nothing sounds as bright as these strings . I 've tried many , and these are the best by far . I know , cause I play'em geetar real good-like .	1
For me this is the best guitar tuner . It does the job correctly and doesnt go crazy when you 're tunnin so , geat ; )	1
I primarily play live and I am a tone-o-holic . In other words , I use high end pedals , cables , amps and pickups and try to keep as little as possibel between my guitar and amp . I bought a couple of these so I could have one on both my main and backup guitar . No more need for a pedal based tuner . These work that well and are almost undetectable from the front . They also wo n't mark up your prized instrument .	1
I have used the Extra Heavy picks for many years but am still searching for that perfect pick . Its strong enough to play metal and some blues style rifts but not so strong it cracks and brakes . I do like the fact it wont turn to powder or fray while playing either but it does wear out fast when playing on heavy gauge strings .	1
I use this item for my daughter 1/2 size guitar , its looks light in weight and firm , and can be adjusted for different sizes of guitars .	1
These screws are not a shiny chrome , so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black Fender Strat body . They are good quality screws .	1
I ended up returning it and bought a cheaper generic model as the other one has better effect for less than half the price . This unit is of high quality , though .	1
this stand is VERY GOOD ! nice and strong , i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this , it is worth a lot more then 29 dollars , this will last a life time , and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily , ,i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash , , so i looked for something better and , i am so happy to have found this , at this price.i did n't want to pay more then 15 dollars for a stand , but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for 9 or 15 dollars and in 6 months its in the trash , i would be buying another one , so really , this is the BEST DEAL , i am SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS STAND you ca n't go wrong with this one , , , REALY ! ! get it ! it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over , its heavy enough not to , it slides up and down nicely , and the book shelf tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well , . , bolts are NOT plastic , witch is nice , ,and very easy to put together and fast , ,i got it together in one minute , i only used regular pliers to put it together.. the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument , i truly recommend this for anyone ! ( i did get the foot guards for $ 1.95 to protect floor , on carpet you will not need them , ) and it comes with a 10 year warranty , and with the free shipping you ca n't beet it ,	1
It 's not an entire bridge assembly but it 's exactly what I needed . In my opinion it is worth the money .	1
For the price , it 's worth it I guess . If you just want to try it , go for it , that 's what I got it for . It sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup , but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals I would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal . But for the price it 's not too bad.Oh , and the casing is n't like a wimpy plastic knife plastic . it 's pretty durable . Albeit do n't throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps .	1
These locks are the only ones I use now , they are on all of my guitars and I put them on all I build . I have not had a guitar drop since I started using them , and have not read of anyone else having one drop either if it was attached . I have tried the Fender lock recently and although it is a great lock it is too large for me and my Schaller equipped straps will not fit them . I will stick with the Schaller in all 3 colors .	1
i had no issues with this , got it so i could tune on stage while playing without making lots of noise . works great , does exactly what it says , definetly get the power supply with it , so you never have to worry about a battery . i said but in the headline because i only used it 3 times .	1
I initially had a black colored one , because I thought that would be more & # 34 ; cool. & # 34 ; But I lost it . So now I get brighter colored ones . Gripe : a rubber thingy on the bottom of the clip came off while performing , and I have not been able to find it . It still works , but that 's a design flaw . Also , do n't leave it attached to any fine guitar , because it , like capos , can permanently damage the finish of a really fine guitar . but it works well , and the batteries seem to last .	1
Fits nice and provides good protection .	1
Just for the thickness of the sound this little jewel makes , it was worth giving this box a try . As someone else previously mentioned , set in a tube breakup setting , this device still is a little fuzzy . The tone , none the less , is very usable and sounds great . I 'm a happy customer and am sure most anyone else will be as well . Thanks for reading this .	1
I love the Snark tuners , and I own several different models . They all work great and of the various models , I prefer the SN-2 ( red ) . I got the white one because I just liked that it was a unique , Amazon-only model . The SN-13 display is like the display on the SN-8 , and offers lower resolution than the SN-1/SN-2/SN-5 displays . Still it works beautifully , and the glossy white looks nice clipped on my Pearl White APX700 . Its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark .	1
In October 2009 I ordered a custom Strat and a Bass and the Custom Strat came with these strings . I recommend going with these . The bullet style makes its easier to install . You know what I mean if you are a professional .	1
This little item saves you the hassle to carry picks everywhere ( wallet for example ) , and lets you securely carry many picks with you . I tought it would include at least a courtesy pair of picks , but it does n't . I 'm not complaining about it , but I think it would be a nice extra.Great buy !	1
i love this tuner so much ! the only reason that i had to buy it a second time was because i lost my first one unfortunately at a music camp a few years back . it works so well though , and i knew i 'd have to buy a second one since i 'd never see the first one again .	1
= ] - Really satisfied with the chair . I can not explain how cool this chair is . Very glad I got it , definitely worth the price for the great overall value that this chair really gives you .	1
I like this capo because it goes on quickly and there is no pulling the strings out of tune . A bit large for one of my cases , but it still makes it in there ok . Seems well made so I am not worried that it will break or need replacing for a long time .	1
Material is similar to my messenger bag 's strap . Reasonably comfortable , but I do n't want it cutting into my neck . Does not go short enough for one of my smaller ukes , a rubber band or spare capo is enough to fix that .	1
Using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks . You simply play faster , no matter what level you are . Alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flat-pick drag . Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch . 24 picks in a pack , is an insane bargain . You pay twice as much in a store .	1
I was looking for a financially good deal . The price was so reasonable , I said , `` How can something this cheap be that good '' , ..well they were a great investment . I use them all the time and have had people ask me where I purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone . When I told them the price , they thought I was pulling there leg , ..I was n't . The case is plastic , foam and clips . Three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone , now compare for yourself . I 'd buy these again in a heart beat . I just might buy another 3-pack ! !	1
A bit more expensive then other strings , But theire worth it , the tone is outstanding , They last a long time , they never rally come out of tune ... .. and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string I 've tryed . The sustain is great they give a nice soth blusey thone , Not to dark not to bright Just perfect.These string 's are worth it !	1
I picked up this Behringer CT100 cable tester because it takes the guesswork out of maintaining a cable collection . The unit does its job very well and it helped me find several bad cables that I previously thought were ok . It is well built and sturdy . The bottom of the tester has sharp metal corners and screws that could damage a wooden table . I suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside.Although the machine itself is good , the accompanying documentation is awful . It presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack . For example , it does not include illustrations of how the LCD readout should look when a cable is good or bad . I had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram . As it turns out , the Behringer CT100 is an inexpensive knockoff of the Morley Swizz Army cable tester . The manual for the Morley unit is available online and it has diagrams that make the testing easier to understand .	1
I like this pick , the hole helps from the pick sliding on your fingers , its not soft or to hard of a pick , ,I like it ,	1
I received this yesterday in my order . It fits on my guitar fine , but I ca n't seem to get my guitar strap affixed to the head stock strap . The button is so rounded and smooth , that my guitar strap just wo n't go over the top of the button . Not sure what to do now .	1
I had purchased a Peak violin stand but was n't thrilled with the height of the violin bow holder -- the tip of the bow dangled just a bit too close to the floor for my comfort . This , being designed to hold either a violin or a viola , allows more height and I feel that the bow is safer . Additionally , this stand allows my violin to be placed on it with the shoulder rest in place while the Peak stand was less secure unless I removed the shoulder rest . So this stand is more versatile for a performing situation and for days at home when I want to have my violin handy and ready to play as time allows.Warning -- do not use any violin stand at all if you have a cat or dog which can come into the room where the violin is resting on the stand . The stand does have a lock to help keep the violin on the stand but it would be very easy to knock the whole thing over if a dog or cat were in a playful energetic mood .	1
Apple threw a curve at me when , with the new `` thin '' iMac , the company eliminated not only the Superdrive but the 3.5mm `` Audio In '' port that had been highly useful on previous models , especially for recording computer sounds with a single patch cord . After trying a Griffin and Logitech device , I finally found a useful workaround with the Behringer UFO202 interface ( there are 2 other very similar models by Behringer -- the UCA202 and the UCA222 ) . What sets these interfaces apart from the 302USB is a smaller footprint and a permanently-attached , `` dedicated '' USB cord . Simply by plugging the USB cord into the USB port on my iMac I was able to record all of the broadcasts , tapes and LPs just as I had done with my old iMac ( though monitoring required more cords in back -- ugh ! ) .For a committed neophyte like me , the UFO202 was probably sufficient . I miss the permanently attached USB `` out '' cable and , moreover , am questioning whether I 'll ever use the mixing capabilities of the 302USB , which to my eyes has a bit of a `` learning curve . '' The problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual . Instead of separate sections , the manual uses small , thin font and mixes English with Spanish instructions -- a minor but unnecessary inconvenience . ( But give Behringer credit for providing a manual ! ) I thought I was investing in more versatility ( for a modest price increase ) than what the Behringer UFO/UCA line of interfaces offered me . But a friend tells me that GarageBand has the capability of recording sound-on-sound . My present programs ( Sound Studio and Toast ) ca n't do it , but if GB can layer 2 or more sound sources , then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better . If not , the Behringer UFO202 is not only adequate to serve my needs , but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new iMac 's desk space ( Apple 's elimination of the internal burner gives the company `` thin screen '' bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space -- thanks to the new requirement of an external burner ) .Behringer has presented the best solution I 've been able to find to Apple 's surprising ( and dubious ) omissions with the latest iMac . If your uses include mixing , and if you have the space ( we 're talking a mere inch or two ) , the 302USB is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks . But if you have a UFO or UCA interface , your needs may already be covered .	1
While this is a simple string cutter ( something one can buy about anywhere ) , it is made well and is of excellent quality . Anyone changing strings on a guitar needs one this tool . It is easy to hold and is a good product .	1
these strings are great with my acoustics-however , lately i 've been using electric strings instead . they work well , sound great , and i believe they really compliment my playing .	1
If there are still people out there who do n't believe in magic , just try this . It has truly elevated my playing a few notches . I 'd probably have bought another bottle already , but this one seems to be lasting forever ! I 've had it a few months now , I use it pretty much a few times everyday , and it still seems full.If after using this your playing does n't improve , then maybe you should give up guitar .	1
this cup /bottle holder fits nicely on my mic stand and holds my water ... . ( or adult bottled beverage ) while playing . seems sturdy and does n't get and condensation on my pedal board due to the neoprene , great product	1
Excellent product , simple and practical design , holds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zone.If humidity levels in your area go below 40 % you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks .	1
I wish there was a fine pivot/angle adjustment to orient harp to mouth . I feel I have to angle my head awkwardly to use harmonica no matter how I set it up . I have a big neck and a prominent jaw so the armature does not extend as far as I think I need it to - causing the position of harmonica angle to be awkward for me . for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth ( LOL ) .This is the least expensive holder I could find Nov 2013 . Since it was inexpensive comparatively I will use a vice and bend it to suit me if my grand nephews do n't want it.Also not sure why they do n't make these wider to accommodate a larger variety of Harmonicas as it has a very strong spring action holding harmonica in place , could easily hold a much larger and longer harmonica if designed to do so . a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design .	1
Works exceedingly well for any use . Whether dubbing audio , recording instruments , or just yelling at the top of your lungs . No issues and pretty sure I will never have any .	1
My mother `` plays '' the guitar ( I am a banjo/mandolin player ) , and the Snark SN-2 came in the mail while I was gone for 5 days . She opened it up , got curious and tried it out on her guitar that prolly has n't been in tune since ... I dunno ... and she LOVED it ! lulz This little thing really is my absolute favorite instrument accessory , both a vibrational and an internal mic pickup . I was using my old Korg chromatic for those times I wanted to see if I was singing the correct note ... and was actually pleasantly surprised that the Snark SN-2 had a mic . One less accessory in the little bag now . : DI am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function , however ... its neat as you can play without the TICK TOCK distraction and still look up once in awhile to see if you are on beat , but as an actual instructional tool for keeping tempo ... mmm , I would still highly recommend using an audible metronome.Side note , if you have friends/family that play a string instrument , be aware your Snark SN-2 *WILL* be making the rounds .	1
You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo . They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do . The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I do n't have to have a seperate capo for each.I also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well . You can never go wrong with a Kyser . Not only that I like the idea that it 's an US company . I 've had some cheaper capos and they just do n't do the job . They either do n't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much . This Kyser will last a long , long time .	1
Was looking for a good solution to practice guitar at night while my 1 year slept . Before I was plugging in headphones to my amp head , but it was getting kind of annoying to set everything up ( take out electric plug covers , get all cords out of the cabinets , etc ) . Oh how life changes with a baby ! : ) This little product is the perfect solution.It takes two AAA batteries ( some generic brand are included in the package ) . There are two ON settings : regular ON and `` FX '' ON . Regular on is basically like a standard lead channel . Turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean . Crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch . Nothing heavy metal , but a nice crisp crunch . FX ON turns on a little delay effect . You can not adjust the delay effect , only turn it on or off . There are also knobs for volume and tone.Plug your headphones into the side , and you can also plug in an MP3 player on the top to jam with a backing track.VOX has samples for all of their AMPlugs on their website , however they seem to be missing samples for the Joe Satriani version . I would say that the JS version is pretty close to the `` LEAD '' amplug.I have a pair of middle/lower range headphones ( Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Studio Monitor Closed-back Dynamic Stereo Headphones ) and the amplug sounds fantastic.In the title I wrote `` wait for this to go on sale '' ... b/c of the JS branding , this particular amplug retails at a much higher price than the other amplugs . However , it frequently drops down to the same price level so keep your eyes peeled ! Personally at the higher MSRP i dont think its worth it , but at the same price it is if you are looking for a nice lead tone .	1
I like those guitar picks and their colors , they are well designed and useful , it comes with different shapes and colors , that makes them easy to locate if you lose them on the floor or anywhere	1
Capo serves me well and the spring mechanism has held up for a year now and does not show signs of deterioration .	1
First real harmonica i have owned . Read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many . The price is right and the quality seems good too . Didnt take me long to start to pick up some techniques such as bending and single/double blow/draw . Still trying to get the overblow . I am far from perfecting the techniques but this harp is pretty easy to bend notes on . It has a good seal also . Only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back .	1
This is actually quite good , no problems after 2 seasons of work , and the neutrik knock-off connectors plug into devices well . The funny thing is they do n't connect that easily to each other , like you might do for storage or to extend a cable run , but a little finagling will get them to mate . I 'm not one to cheap out on a lot of things , but some cable prices are kinda ridiculous nowadays . I 'm not saying there is n't a place for high quality cables , but If you have jobs were you do n't need cables made of pure spun 100 % angel 's pubic hair , these will get the job done .	1
The music stand is perfect for the keyboard I am playing . It is strong , height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly .	1
The first rule of microphones is that , `` No one microphone is perfect for every purpose . '' Rule two is , `` Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound . '' I 've used Shure SM58 's along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968 . I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used ( and still do use ) them for singing some back up vocals.The SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use . Some people , me included , actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic , the Shure SM-57 . The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice . For example , anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58 . People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.The SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect ( which means the bass increases the closer you get . ) This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away . The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they do n't sound right . On the other hand , the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user 's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away . While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic , there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly . It works ok for conga drums and the like , but the SM-58 is about the last thing you 'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar . Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice , but for some people they sound great . The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen . However for other people the SM-58 works better . It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do . If you have a very deep voice , the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.One certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability . This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal . Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available ( at a slight extra cost ) with a built-in on/off switch . The SM-58 's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars . I 've seen SM-58 's dented , rusty , dusty , smoked up , spit into , with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I 've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.All the pro-line Shure mics are top quality . The pro line Shures also hold their value well . If you buy one and decide you do n't like it , you can get about what you paid for it on eBay . I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one . Senneheiser 's EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look . The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice . These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they 'd still be around for another 20 years at least .	1
I love these clip on , vibration reading tuners , This was the second one I tried , The first was a Barcus Berry , which worked equally well , They both have lots of features , such as tap tempo , up and down tuning adjustments . With the Barcus Berry , it was the first one , after trying the Snark , which is a cool name and a lot more colorful , I tuned up a brand new guitar in a store , out of the box in less than 2 minutes , never came close to doing that before . That convinced me , the Quicktunes I had been using were accurate , but these seemed to be better , and get you perfect , I have heard that they work better on acoustic instruments , which makes sense , they put out a lot more vibrations than a solid body electric.From the literature it , seems that the snark could have been made by the quicktune company and the company that makes the cool cats pedals , that have been raved about.Hello , Raving bout this . I seen on Amazon they are cheaper , I bought a blue guitar only one at my local store for 19.99 , here they are around 10 to 12 bucks . These type of tuners , especially the intellitouch are popular wih Bluegrass folk like me , The grapics on this are great , no more shaky needle , just a dead on still reading when you are perfect .	1
This is obviously a necessary item if you want to attach this to a microphone stand . It holds great and keeps the microphone snug into palce . However , The gap for the cable to fit through should be a bit bigger , as well as the tail-end of the grip ; because if you have a certain kind of XLR adapter that is wider than the microphone , you wo n't be able to take the microphone out of the grip without disconnecting the XLR adapter first .	1
It took me a while to figure out how to implement this mic . But with the right equipment it has turned out to be a nice addition to my recording studio .	1
A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I 've never had cause to remove it . At first I thought I 'd hate the look of it there , but it 's never bothered me one bit . Reaching for pics is never a problem . I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics . This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal .	1
Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas , but I 'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks , depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance . I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood , really - to support the instrument from the bottom . The top hanger now just serves as a rest , but depending on the guitar 's balance I 'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there 's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward .	1
I used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics . It was easy to clean and left the wood feeling soft and polished without that slick feeling that other oils do . Highly recommended	1
I own Dunlop , Kyser and G7th Nashville Capos . I do n't like the direction the Dunlop faces , it seems awkward . The Kyser spring is very poplar , but I think the spring tension is too strong , making it harder to take on and off and I think it makes the strings a little sharp . I like the G7th Nashville Capo , but the spring tension is inconsistent . The used to be softer , maybe too soft , but the lastone I bought was almost as still as the Nashfille . Ths Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is similar to the Kyser and Nashville Capos , but the tension is adjustable and seems to be the best of all combinations . Only downside is I think the Nashville capo looks better .	1
Great stand for the price . Threaded fine and it 's heavy enough for any mic you 've got . there are better out there but it 's a good value .	1
I got these mics because I am in an environment where we needed the ON/OFF toggle on the microphone and - for us - it works great . These mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room . They sound similar to the Shure SM58 and we use them every day . They are still going strong .	1
This was exactly what I needed and worked out great . It would have been nice to have the felt pads included with the buttons . I had to pay another dollar at my local guitar shop for the felt padded washers .	1
I have an Epiphone Dot and I installed a Bigsby V5 on it . I could not find a gig bag for semi hollow body guitar so settled on this one due to the price . And a previous reviewer said his Dot with Bigsby fits . Well it fits , but just barely . The guitar fits snugly in the plush lined case . I have to turn the arm of the Bigsby around , facing down , to close the case . I think the case probably pushes the arm down a little bit even in this position . I probably would n't store my guitar in this case for long periods cuz I 'd worry about tension on the strings . Otherwise I like it .	1
Not much to say about patches ... they have n't given me ANY trouble , which is as good as it gets with cables !	1
This is the best clip on tuner out there . It 's dead accurate , does n't bounce around like dial needle tuners , and it 's EASY TO READ ! You just clip it to your headstock , either acoustic or electric , turn it on , position the face toward you and start tuning very quickly . Highly recommended for all string players , especially electric or acoustic guitar or Dobro . There are other tuners by Snark that are more sensitive to lower ranges and higher ranges , so check out what suits your needs .	1
A real money saver a very smart buy ! It works perfect with my Boss pedals ! I am very Happy !	1
I have many acoustic guitars and I use this on all of them to keep them looking good . Easy to use , wipe on and wipe off .	1
The winder works well for me , and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool ( so I do n't have to search out a pair of snips ) , but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward . Also , the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy , and does n't work well for reluctant pins . I actually like my Dunlop winder better ; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more , but I guess that 's the compromise of having a working cutter , so I wo n't be throwing away my other winder any time soon .	1
The Rogue Analog Delay is well-constructed and feels very high quality given the price . It 's similar in size to an MXR stompbox , though the knobs are more reminiscent of a BOSS . Delay is a very simple effect that is increasingly available on modeling amplifiers to cheap plastic entry-level pedals.I really have no complaints about the Analog Delay in terms of how it performs and sounds . It does a good job of creating that ambient short delay sound up to about 320ms , or slapback rockabilly on quicker repeats . It 's just too bad that they were n't able to stretch out the delay time a little longer , perhaps to 450ms or 500ms . Once you get into that territory , there 's a much broader array of things you can play , including the U2-style phrasing repeats . That being said , a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway.But it is n't fair to compare this pedal to an MXR Carbon Copy , and if you 're looking for something cheap and surprisingly high-quality to provide ambiance , the Rogue will do just fine .	1
I am collecting these unique guitar picks and putting them into pick display cases . This is a great pick ! I am using the other 5 and they play very well !	1
I cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp , I was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound , Instead I could n't put it away , I must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe , The tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing , I would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp , The 9v battery holds up well ( which is surprising considering the drive you got off it ) So spend the $ 20.00 and get something that is a real deal , I hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one	1
This is a great little amp especially for the money . It 's all tube , has a power attenuator , headphone out and reverb all for under $ 200 - CRAZY ! ! It 's built extremely well and has some weight to it , but you 'd have no problem carrying it to a small gig . A 5 watt tube amp is still quite LOUD , so the attenuator is a god-send.How does it sound you ask ? Tone is subjective , but to my ears it can get quite `` Marshally '' without a lot of work with a Les Paul as well as a Tele . I do n't own a Strat , so I ca n't comment on single coils through it . On the 1 watt setting with the volume pinned and the gain on about 5 I had a damn good `` Back In Black '' style hard rock tone . If you want to play Metal you 're going to need a distortion/overdrive pedal . I 've found that if you pin the gain it can get a bit boxy and fizzy . The headphone out is n't great , it 's good enough for practice , but do n't try to use it as a line out for recording.I 've done some recording using a 57 on-axis about an inch from the speaker grill slightly right of center . When stacking 3-4 tracks ( especially using different guitars ) I got a HUGE , Plexi like tone without it getting muddy or fuzzy.I have n't swapped tubes or the speaker - it 's completely stock . I might try putting a Jensen speaker in it , but the stock tone is just fine as it is . The stock speaker is an 8 '' Bugera `` vintage '' ( think greenback clone ) and it is darker than a lot of small speakers . A lot of guys are swapping out the tubes for JJ 's or GT 's , but it all depends on what you 're after for tone.A lot of guitar snobs are afraid of the Beringer name on it ( Bugera is made by Beringer ) , but I found this amp to be very good quality - especially given that it was made in China.I would recommend this amp if you are looking for good tube tone on the cheap . It 's an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type . I was able to get great Marshall like tone out of it quite easily . Good stuff ! !	1
I have n't used this yet , but it seems solid and idiot proof - just like I need . Play coffee shops and will help if I drop my pick . Very good price .	1
This is my first mixer . I 'd been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from USB-powered mics like the Blue Snowball to something a little more professional and , of course , that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups.Thus , I am an amateur and you 'll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional.Anyway , my pros and consPros1 . This thing is way smaller than I expected . I can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it does n't take up a lot of desk space . It fits well where I put it.2 . It works as intended . I use this with a GLS ES-57 mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good . I have my windows volume set at 75 and the gain is up at about 60 % . I have no hissing and no problems . I did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co-host ( we do it over Skype ) said I sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good . This is a stark improvement over the Blue Snowball.3 . It 's plug and play . I plugged it in , it installed the drivers , and it automatically set itself as the default microphone . Easy peasy.4 . I use Reaper as my audio software and Reaper recognized it immediately.5 . The dials and everything was easy to understand.Cons1 . You ca n't plug this into a USB hub ( or even an AC-powered USB hub ) otherwise you 'll get a hiss . This needs to be plugged directly into a computer.2 . This high-jacks your audio defaults in Windows . To fix it , open your Control Panel , open the Sound , and set your Playback device to your speakers to fix the problem . Your sound will come out through your speakers as intended . Since I use this as my main mic , I left it as default in the Sound settings.Overall , for the price , this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs . I know there are better options but they are also more expensive and I 'm on a budget . It 's a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money . If you 're like me and a single person doing YouTube video voice overs or podcasts , this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person . Worth every penny as long as it lasts . I 'll update when/if it breaks down but until then , I do not regret this purchase .	1
By far the best to use on the neck of any guitar or bass . Applies easily and what is not absorbed between frets , wipes right up . A must to keep wood looking fresh .	1
I needed a way to boost the input of a wired lapel microphone coming from the preacher directly into my powered speakers . Works great !	1
This is a perfect strap for my guitar . It 's not rough on my neck and is very adjustable . It 's very simple and is perfect for me . I 'm very pleased with this purchase .	1
This gig bag was just what I needed to carry around a soprano ukelele . It has a strap for slinging the instrument over your shoulder when in the gig bag , padding , and a pocket in the front for your tuner . The zipper is strong enough and it was just what I needed to carry around the ukelele to keep it protected while in transit .	1
I 've been playing guitar for about 7 years now , and I 've always used the Kaiser capo , but since I got this planet waves one , the kaiser just gathers dust in my guitar case . Although they 're both just tools to hold down the strings on a certain fret , the planet waves is much easier because it uses spring action with little effort , while I can recall the kaiser taking a lot more work to actually get it onto the guitar . Less pressure is involved , and I kind of like the fact that the rest of the capo , that is n't actually barring down the frets , is under the guitar instead of over it . The product conceals itself well to those who are n't playing the instrument and it has great use . I 'd recommend this to anyone who wants the best capo out there .	1
I 've only need to use this a couple of times and it worked well . The cover is supple and easy to coil .	1
I was unaware when I originally purchased these that there was a threaded mic mount on the back extension pole . I already had a couple 13 '' posi-lok boom arms that I popped on them and was able to reclaim two floor mic stands and save a little bit more floor space . They are fairly well constructed for the price and fit perfectly in my small home studio . The mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore .	1
This product is straight forward and works as it 's intended.One side note - there is a pretty loud squeak that occurs when winding the strings . I 'm not sure if all of them do this but the one I received does . It does n't cause any problem with the product 's performance ... it 's just loud .	1
I purchased this guitar about a year ago and the thing 's still kickin , not planning on replacing it anytime soon.Once I got some new strings put on this beauty sounded like a singing angel , action was fine for me out of the box.Most definitely one of the best & # 34 ; bang-for-your-buck & # 34 ; acoustic guitars .	1
Hosa patch cables are the best for the buck . Great sound and flexible . I 'm a firm Hosa cable fan . Love these little guys .	1
I just got it today and have n't spent too much time with it yet . It sounded OK and I like the features on it . I especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal . As soon as you press down it 's on . Lots of adjustments so I 'll be tweaking for a while to find my sound , but it seems like it 's going to be OK . It 's a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve . For the money It 's a great pedal .	1
Excellent picks , with nicely rounded corners to the essentially triangular shape and nicely beveled edges to make tremolo playing easy and smooth . The only problem I have is that I keep changing my mind between whether I want a crisp corner for my picking for clarity or a pick like these for smoother playing . These are a great addition to any mandolin player 's case because they give the player a nice alternative to trying to use one of the rounded corners on a pick like a Fender heavy .	1
As capos go , this gets the job done at a good price . Easy to use . Does n't seem to put undue pressure on the guitar .	1
I bought a couple of these two years ago . They are a sturdy but lightweight stand . The small footprint is nice for those with limited space . I use for both electric and acoustic guitars . I will say that the two I recently purchased are NOT the same as the ones purchased in 2011 . The pictured product is the same but the actual product is not . The newer stands have a rear leg that is about half the length as the older model . The tubing is smaller on the upright piece and the body support . The body support now inserts through the base tube ; the earlier design had a reinforced tube that accepeted the body support piece . The rubber feet are also smaller . These changes appear to make the newer stand less sturdy and stable , however I believe the stand will be adequate for most full size guitars . I did n't notice any offensive rubber odor others have reported . There may be a concern about damage to certain finish . I would simply wrap the rubber or replace it with an inert material .	1
It does the job . It 's bulky but it works well . It comes with an extra set of holders for thicker tablets ( or to use the tablet while still in the case ) .	1
If you 're a musician , there are those things that you got ta have on a regular basis and for guitar , strings are one of those things . I give these 4 stars rather than 5 just because I know there are better strings out there . However , these ones are great . I like the sound they provide and the price is nice .	1
If I did n't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I would n't do it , plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I ca n't find in RadioShack , Best Buys no where else , I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself , but for business . These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way , I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards , ffsalsa	1
Simple . Effective . Just what I wanted . Seems a tad flimsy , but , time will tell . Tuning could n't be easier . Neat product .	1
I 'd chose this cable cause I own an older one with the angle plug and needed another longer cable with the straight end . I like the idea that you can cut the power and remove the cable from the instrument with having mute the amp or mixer . I recommend this product to anyone who likes the ability to disconnect without doing anything else .	1
I have tried a few and this is the one I settled on if you need a multi-tool . The cutters rip through bass strings like butter and seem to hold up . The winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good .	1
Works as advertised . Makes the fretboard look and feel nice ! I imagine this stuff will last for quite a long time as well since you only really use this when you 're changing your strings .	1
usually picks are picks , but these are a blast , I play by holding the `` horns '' between thumb and forefinger and using the mouth to pick out the notes , I had to order 2 extra bags of these because people keep begging for one .	1
This was exactly what I was after . I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect . Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches . I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals .	1
I needed a new strap but I did n't want to pay $ 20 for one . I saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot . I 'm glad I did . The strap is awesome . It 's very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap I 've ever had . It totally deserves 5 stars !	1
I 've had this for several years . It has worked flawlessly . It has done a pretty good job with many recordings , especially in the field . Zoom has now upgraded this unit and has other models on the market that are superior . At the time this first came out it was one of the best on the market in its price class .	1
I like it , got it fast and it is just the right length for my at home personal use . Thanks for getting it to me so fast , and I recommend going through the vendor I received this from it works great .	1
Quick and accurate . I also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars . Doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though .	1
I do n't know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case . This one surpassed my expectations.Months into using the Gig Bag and not a single problem . The pockets are packed with books , tools , and strings.The shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze .	1
I had the SN1 Guitar Tuner , this one the SN2 is actually for all instruments if I 'm not mistaken and it works great . Never fails . I love the red , the swivel head , the green.red lights when tuning . Just remember to take it off the headstock when youre done using it	1
I needed some little , easy , and portable guitar stands for the stage . This does it perfectly , well . While being light and portable .	1
Having 250 feet of xlr - xlr ( m-f ) cables that can be used any way I want ( e.g . 2 ea 125 foot for stereo , 1 250 foot for mono , or 10 ea 25 foot for multichannel work ) is very flexible.The packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord ( white ) to store them when not in use.As all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors , this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job . I ended up using all 10 of the 25 ' cords for mics and amplified speakers , plus another 6 of their 3 foot cables for interconnect . You can never have enough xlr cables or adapters !	1
It works pretty well on my ukulele , however it left several dents and scratches on the tuners of my ukulele .	1
These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads . Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most . As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all . They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company .	1
This works with equal ease across all six strings , or only the bottom three . Have n't run across a need to try it on the top three by themselves yet . But judging by its performance on the bottom three , and its fierce grip , it 'll do just fine .	1
Really , they are . I really do n't have anything more to say about it . I 've played for 13 years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever . Affordable , accurate , and they do n't fall off your knee all the time lol !	1
D'Addario always comes through for the musician who wants a great product on the cheap . I 've used boutique strings for many years , but always come back to these . Great tone , great string life ( with a little maintenance ) and very reasonably priced . Loved these as a replacement for the Fender Super Bullets that came on my USA Fender Standard Stratocaster .	1
These are made solid and are very stable . I knocked it to 4 stars because they do n't match up . The holes in the poles for the safety pin are not at the same interval on each stand so it can look funky .	1
I 've owned over 3 dozen dirt boxes over the years , and I just love the Rat . It makes my tube halfstack sing , and my practice amp sound like a big amp.Its great as a stand alone distortion , running on a clean amp . It can get everything from that perfect bluesy grit to roaring sludge ( just max out the distortion and use your neck pickup on an LP to sound EXACTLY like King Buzzo of the Melvins ) and everything inbetween.It can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory . Case in point , my buddy has an old Peavy stack from the 70 's in his garage . Its a solid state head on top of a vertical cab of two 14 '' speakers . On its own , you can use the gain and distortion knobs present on the amp to get a decent sound , but with his Les Paul it still sounded oddly dark . We put the Rat in front of it and with some fiddling got that perfect AC/DC style overdrive out of it.I think the main reason I love the Rat so much is not only the great tone and its sheer indestructability , but the filter knob . Normal tone knobs allow you to focus more on bass or treble , but usually if you boost one , you cut the other . The filter is more of a high end roll off , you can darken or brighten your tone accordingly , but when you DO go brighter , you still have the same bottom end . It does n't CUT the bass out . So even with a more treble heavy sound , you still have a fuller rounder tone , it does n't thin out so much.Its really an excellent pedal . I 've heard that some claim you have to get an older one with the LM308 chip to really get `` the sound '' but that 's a myth . Look on a few guitar forums or on youtube for plenty of tests and testimony showing the fact that the new ones do indeed sound the same as the old ones . A Rat is a Rat , whether they 're coming from China or the USA.p.s . Mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark . So I dunno what that other guy was complaining about .	1
I didnt have my research done correctly and ordered these because i wanted & # 34 ; vintage & # 34 ; for my & # 34 ; relic 'd & # 34 ; build . Clearly my mistake that these do not fit the cheap necks sold here on Amazon . But no worries , Amazon sells adapters to make the & # 34 ; large & # 34 ; holes in the neck fit the & # 34 ; smaller & # 34 ; vintage tuning key posts.1 star off for not looking like the higest quality . I 'm happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price .	1
Overdrive that wont drive you over ... love it for the price as usual danelectro delivered I love their products for that reason they sound like a couple hundred bucks and yet ... .	1
I was using a Joyo Power supply and when I bought my Fuzz I ran out of plugs so I bought this . It does the job . I plan on getting a couple of the Juniors next since I only have 1 18V pedal and the rest are 9 's	1
Nice quality and love the cutter . The winder is a little awkward to use . I guess I need a little practice . But the cutters are great .	1
They are cheap and look good . They also have a nice full sound and are holding up well . Highly recommended .	1
These are really great bang for the buck , however , like many people said , they do not work well for all my pedals , round ends do n't fit in everything.I mean these are cables..	1
Why not ? For the price and some reviews I found online , I had to try this pedal . I bought one myself and it has remained on my pedalboard since I 've bought it . NOTE : I recently put this right after my wah and before my dirt boxes and I 've found that it does two things ; 1 . The vibe sound does n't get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2. any volume drop you might experience having this after some od/distortion seems to be less . I suggest playing around and trying this pedal in different places on your pedal chain to see what works best for you . For me , it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz . Do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this . Mine is musicman587 ... .this is the pedal AFTER pedals , but you 'll get a good idea of the general settings I use it on .	1
If you need an 808 Clone on the Cheap this is your pedal . Do n't be fooled though , it does not school the classic Tube Screamer but it holds its own . This was a main staple on my pedalboard until I found a great deal on a Bad Monkey and then sadly it came off . I was not looking to replace it at the time , it just happened the Bad Money did what I needed it to do better.I recommend this pedal to everyone and anyone who needs an 808 but has the budget of your average gigging musician : ) .Maxon 808 $ 150.00Ibanez TS9 $ 100Joyo Vintage OD $ 50	1
It 's a Fender Heavy so there 's not much else to say about that . Good price and selection here . Go for it .	1
My newest amp ( the Marshall JVM410 Joe Satriani ) replaced the reverb with noise gates ... a function I absolutely love . But then I needed a reverb pedal . Honestly , there are more expensive pedals out there , but this will do exactly what they do for a lot less money . Give it a try . I 've been using it for a few weeks and I 'm extremely happy with it .	1
These tuners are amazing ! I like them so much I bought another one . They work better than tuners costing ten times as much ! You do n't have to be a rocket scientist to use it . It 's so simple a child can use it . The face of the tuner is lighted and easy to read even in the dark . It is extremely accurate . This is so much better than my Intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what I paid for the Intellitouch . It 's very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without . It uses one CR2032 3 volt battery and comes with the battery included . You have to install the battery which is no big deal . Just read the instructions . I recommend it highly and give it two thumbs up and a couple of toes too !	1
Not an expert at string picking by any means , but they do what I need them to do just fine .	1
Sweet strap , nice colors , good quality . Adjusts easily , nice quality leather hookups . Do n't forget your strap locks if you 're planning to rock out : - ) Looks great with my white Fender Jazz Bass Standard !	1
I bought this and a Hohner Special 20 key of C harp to test them both out . This harp is a great harp , pretty much the exact same as the Hohner Special 20 in overall quality . `` Feels '' a little more airtight , brighter and louder than the hohner , but in side-by-side testing the effect is diminished.The Hohner Special 20 just seems to have this little extra ... expression to it . More life or something.Both harps very bendable , etc . Real high quality.As for the replaceable reed plates ... Amazon has this harp marked down to about the $ 25 level . Reed plate replacements are about $ 19 . Now I realize that at retail that 's half the price of a RETAIL harp , but only $ 6 less than a `` whole new harp '' otherwise.With this in mind , I would generally recommend beginners start with the Hohner Special 20 . Just a slightly better or at least more fun-sounding and fun to play harp with a little more animation and expression available `` free '' , in my opinion .	1
These are okay strings for the Folk Guitar ... ... ... ... .nothing special but the price is n't out of the world either . Good buy for the money . Tried them on a Gibson J50 and they seem to do good .	1
I 've owned Loop Stations , DM-4s , Jam Mans , Samplers and all that jazz . They 're all full of crap you dont need . This pedal has flawless , colorless sound quality . It records what you sound like . You click it on , record your riff , click it and listen to it loop . Tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over . You can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers . Smallest , Cheapest , easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find . If you need all the drum loops and the ability to save loops for later use , then dont get this one , but if you just want a good way to jam with yourself or a live loop similar to the DM-4 but with more time on the loop then yes get this .	1
I left my trusty Manhasset behind on a job and was about to replace it when I came upon this alternative offered by Amazon . As banged up as a Manhasset can get from week-end warriors like me who simply throw it on top of everything else in the backseat before the long ride home , I 've never had one fail on me over the past 40+ years . There 's nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust , yet all of the moving parts always seem to retain just the right amount of tension , preventing 5-10 pound folders from lowering the top half or causing it to dip forward . But the `` rub '' is their non-adaptability . The feet on the base are permanently attached as is the upper tray holding the music . Consequently , these ubiquitous , well-proven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a crowded van or sedan , especially with a couple of keyboards , amps , instrument stands , and other requisite gear on board.This is where Amazon 's On-Stage Music Stand becomes attractive ( of course , it does n't hurt that it costs less than a Manhasset ) . It permits you to fold up the legs to a position parallel with the shaft as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music . Consequently , it 's much easier to find a convenient place -- whether in the trunk or on the floor of the back seat -- for packing the stand . Simply `` slide '' it into position.The drawback -- apart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about ( be careful not to over-tighten those set-screws ! ) -- is that this thing is heavy . Frankly , I was expecting a lightweight stand , at least compared to my old Manhasset , but if you 've owned or been around the latter , the first thing you 're likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable , substantial addition in weight . At the same time , with the moving parts and the set screws ( topped by plastic , rotating , serrated wheels ) , the On-Stage stand does n't give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the Manhasset -- in other words , I 'm very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gear-pile after a long , exhausting 4-hour gig.Bottom line : the On-Stage appears to be a good value -- a truly heavy-duty stand ( in most respects ) that 'll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room and that packs up conveniently for traveling jobs . But do n't expect it to lighten your load or , simply because it 's heavier , to last longer than a Manhasset.If you do a lot of traveling and do n't plan to put one of those 1000-page piano folders on the stand , there 's at least one truly lightweight ( albeit plastic ) stand that 's worked out really well for me ( perhaps needless to say , some have n't -- they fall apart or they 're so ingeniously designed that it takes 15 minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back in their unforgiving , pint-sized cases ) . But the Peak stand is made to hold up ( in turn , it holds up relatively heavy music books ) and has served me well for several years ( just as I was about to condemn the stand , I called the company , they responded immediately by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped , and the Peak stand has been problem-free ever since ) . It 'll cost you a bit more , but not as much as some folks are willing to spend in exchange for losing a few unwanted pounds .	1
I 've read the revues and some do n't do them justice . These fit very well , do the job they 're supposed to do and if you know you have a hardwood guitar , just use a cordless drill to attach them , make sure you place the clutch at a low level in order not to strip the wood and have a secure fit .	1
This pick holder works for me . It holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed . It fits my Jasmine well . Buy it from GO-DPS since they have one of the best customer service and quality products !	1
These are a good value for quality strings.Strings stayed in tune after about two hours of settling in.I 'm very satisfied .	1
I have used Ernie Ball strings on my Les Paul for quite a while , Slinkys mostly . I recently bought a Yamaha FG700S and quickly found that the high E string had a very `` tinny '' tone . I searched the net to see if this was comon with this model , alas I found that it is.So I decided to try some different strings to see if it would help . I ordered a set of Earthwood Lights and installed them last night.Wow , what a difference . First the tone is much softer on the E string , second the action feels much more comfortable on strings 1 thru 3 . The strings that came on the guitar were Yamaha light strings but they were very stiff , especially the B string . After a hour of playing with the Earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable , both tonally and physically . Not sure how they will last , time will tell.Good strings I would recommend them .	1
Almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys . When I put them on I felt confident that I would n't have that issue anymore . It 's easier to strap up because of the quick release tab . This should be every bassist/guitarist 's best friend .	1
I do n't have any real praise or complaints about this . I does just what it should , and for the price , it 's pretty good . Like most pedals , it can be used with a 9V plug-in transformer , but it 's not included . Yes , it 's made of plastic , but you ca n't expect any more for $ 25 .	1
I have two of them . One in the guitar case holding my Martin HD28 and the other in the case of my Blueridge flattop . Just clip it on about the nut and tune away . Pickers playing next to me do n't interfere with me tuning.Works great !	1
I ordered eight of these after reading the reviews . I have five guitars , including two Les Paul 's and they hold them just fine . I give them four stars . The are fine for , I believe , all guitars at home , but I would n't use them for retail or something like a school . They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it 's just a rivet the holds them together . The wall anchors that they send with them are a joke . like the other reviewer said , you really should find a stud to mount them to , but if you must use wall anchors , use the burly moly ones that bore into the dry wall . All in all these are sturdy and stable ( when anchored to a stud ) and I 'll use more if I have the need .	1
works ok for the price and features it is fine . get the batteries it did not came with any . I am using it for a dj karaoke system I do recommend it .	1
Ca n't get your banjo to sound right without a great set of finger and thumb picks . have been using these for years now .	1
There 's another brand out there that is almost identical in construction and quality and costs less . Do n't buy the high rated chrome capped one 's , I had problems with those . This one is good just that I regret paying so much for it .	1
I liked it . Very useful for connecting rack components between . Great idea in different colors . I will buy it again .	1
This is a great little tuner for guitar . Love the fact i can tune all 6 strings at the same time	1
Look no further this is the best Booster with an internal EQ , what else can you ask for ? Go for it , if you need a versatile small booster , it comes with a 9v battery	1
I have a Squire tele and replaced the tuners with these . The 'tab ' holes did n't match up , they are bigger than the Squire originals but it was no problem to set new holes and tighten them up . The hold tunings and make string changing a breeze . Highly recommended . True Fender product .	1
30 bucks is better than 179 for the tube screamer from Ibanez and the sound is very similar based on youtube . I use this on the clean channel of my Bugera V22 tube amp and it makes my guitars sound like they should . Awesome with my LTD VC-401 with 59 and JB pickups .	1
Great accessary for Yamaha keyboards . Fits and works well . Very adequate construction , should last for many hours of playing at home or out !	1
I bought this for my brother for a Christmas gift when we got him a guitar . He never used it , but not because of anything to do with the actual product	1
To test I installed one pad and left the original pad on the other side of my 440 's . The 840 pad has a larger surface area ( see my pics with the old pad on the left in all shots ) so I guess that spreads out the pressure over a larger area . But it 's really minimal and I did not notice a huge difference pressure wise . The material is nicer/softer than the original so that is a plus . Every so often I would flip the headphones around to see if I could tell anything . The larger pad does cover more of the ear- almost surrounds it . But seriously , if you had me blindfolded I would n't bet my life that I always knew which side were which . But in general the large pad and softer material seems to be a better set up . I ca n't imagine any set of cans actually feeling comfortable to have on for an extended period of time.Sound difference ? Yes , one side in my test sounded better I felt ... until I switched them around ! Just like eyes your two ears are not 100 % equal and over time they lose their edge but not at equal rates . I think those who make any kind of big deal out of any significant improvement or degradation in sound might be imagining it . I would have to see some measureable proof to believe that whatever millimeters ' worth of difference in how the drivers may sit in relationship to your eardrums affects how the sound waves actually strike them . Wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe ? Notice the contradictory reviews- more bassy , less bassy etc ? ? ? It becomes highly subjective and I would n't buy or not buy these pads based upon those claims . If you need replacements this is no brainer as a cheap way to keep your expensive headphones alive . If you need more comfort then these may do the trick for you but I 'm glad I did n't pay any more for them than I did from Amazon . That 's my 2 cents .	1
This seems to be a nice , rugged stand . Much better than the one I received with a guitar I ordered . It went together fast and is well padded . It cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid . I 'm not sure how much I will use it now I have discovered guitar wall hangers , or string swings . I prefer hanging them on the wall and not having them on the floor in the way , just my preference.I suppose these would be good for mic night or doing a gig , but I do n't expect that will ever be something I do unless I get a lot better than I am now . I still suck ... .but I 'm having fun and trying .	1
Great strings , fully recommended . I have been playing guitar for about 30 years , I only use D'Addarios & Dean Markleys . Good sound , long lasting .	1
This is the best case ever for the money ! I have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the Gator Deluxe . I like this case so much , I plan to purchase two more this week .	1
I use two of these as L/R channels , and my Fishman Soloamp as a center channel . I use a Rode NT4 stereo mic , run everything through my Mackie mixer , adding some reverb and delay ( delay a little of the left , send to right channel , and vice versa ) , and it sounds fantastic ( way better than with just the Fishman alone ) . Another tip : Get a copy of Yamaha 's Sound Reinforcement Handbook ... when it comes to audio , there are so many aspects that all effect each other , so you really need a good technical understanding of it , otherwise you could randomly mess around with everything forever just to get an `` ok '' sound .	1
This is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double-leather ends . The color stands out well on the black background . Available in various colors .	1
This unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay . It 's not so & # 34 ; digital and bright & # 34 ; delay like Boss DD3 or DD7 . Mod switch adds a perfect & # 34 ; chorus & # 34 ; effect for 80 's Metal Ballads sound .	1
I play resonator guitars open tuned . These are the only strings that hold up well to the tension of an open & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; tuning . I recently tried multiple other brands and gauges ( almost every B string snapped / to C # ) only to come back to these ... Only wish they came in packs of 10 cause I go through about three sets a month ( 3 guitars )	1
Looks better than the expansive one my Grandson has . He keeps using MINE ! ! ! Arrived early and is of great quality . Fits my VERY old acoustic just right !	1
These are the best guitar strings I have used in over 50 years of playing the guitar . Made in USA a very good price . You can buy more expensive guitar strings , just not better guitar strings .	1
My picks fall out way too easy while i 'm playing live	-1
Not really bright enough . Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same . I would look for something else if I did n't already have this . OK for reading a small book in bed , but does n't cover the sheet music brightly enough .	-1
In my experience these cables were not great . The connectors rattle , they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise . I ca n't expect miracles at that price-point but I certainly expected better . I avoid this brand of cables .	-1
The fact that it is passive really kills it . I just could not get any sound out of it , I tried multiple placements . I finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it . Not worth the money , or the extra hole in your guitar .	-1
Arrive , in trashed packing , but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard ... certainly NOT professional quality or any quality that I would give it .	-1
Okay , Color coding is a GREAT idea.Divas will not use the red ball windscreen.Why ? Because , from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.No kidding ! I have had several tell this to me and my sound tech . So save your dough , buy any color but RED.Diva 's ! ! ! ! What can I say ?	-1
I bought this to use with my keyboard . I was n't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals . It does n't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano , which is what I 'd always used . Does n't have the same feel either . Nowhere close.In my opinion , a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice . The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better . The only thing I 've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals .	-1
The TASCAM TH-2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears ! They are great ! Excellent bass response ( not muddy at all ) , tight mids , and clear highs . To boot , they are extremely comfortable as well . The foam fits nicely around your ears , conforming to the contours of your face . They are adjustable , so if you have a huge head you can still wear these . The only drawback that I can see , and I do n't really even consider this a negative , is the coiled cord . Some people may not like that . All in all these are great headphones - I have listened to all varieties of music with them , monitored recordings with them , etc ... excellent ! By the way , they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background , making the music come out clearer . Kudos to Tascam for making such good headphones ! May 12 , 2014 UPDATE -- -- -- These headphones quit working after just a few months of working properly . I have a couple pair of inexpensive behringers that have lasted through more abuse and are still working . What a disappointment ! ! !	-1
I 'm another reviewer who has , upon personal inspection , discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar . I returned it.I 've & # 34 ; First Act & # 34 ; brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed .	-1
Amazon and TC Electronics will not tell you that you need a 9V Power Supply . I did n't see any warning or advise in the Point of Purchase , nor in the package . This is an unfair practice from Amazon and TC Electronics .	-1
I bought an Ibanez Concert size uke . The body is 2 inches wide ( less than the 2.75 inches stated for this stand ) . My uke does not fit well in the stand . Why ? The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow , and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke . Thus , any uke that is concert size or greater . So , most ukes do n't fit well . They fit , just not well.I did , and you will likely need this advice , remove the bottom fork , turn it upside down , and reinstall it ( no tools required ) . Now the `` curve '' of it is upward , and the uke better sits on it . The fit is improved . Not great but better . One stand ca n't fit all instruments , but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars . This small stand does not hold most all ukes.Although its neat how it folds up , like the video here on Amazon reviews , it is very heavy for its size . This is not a lightweight stand . At all . Surprisingly heavy , and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag , trust me.I wish I got the Hercules standHercules GS402B Mini Stand . All Hercules stuff is superb , and my friend has one for his uke and says it 's sublime ( I do n't own it , myself , so I just present this so you can research it and it 's reviews on Amazon ) . I own other Herc stuff , and it 's all ideal , and for a few bucks more , I could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one . Oh , well , for once , I got cheap . And got burned for it.All in all , not great , this tiny stand . One stand fits NOT all . Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand , but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments . You may think you can bend the lower forks , but it 's hard to do , will require a vice , and if you see on the Amazon pictures , the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves , so if you splay it out like it should be , you 'll change the way it fits in the grooves , and thus it won ; t work at all . It 's just an imperfect design . My take on it , your mileage may vary . Bye bye .	-1
This is an update to my original review because I have now fully tested two of these capos . I 'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here . I 'm not sure how it 's possible . I 've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos . I had purchased two , which I have now given away to student players as I can not use them . I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar . The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring . Both capos had this very same problem.When I received these capos , I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos . The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos . The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product . As a professional musician , I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I ca n't afford to have my gear failing during performances . I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand , and no measurable reputation . When I contacted the seller , they were not honest with me .	-1
I purchased this as my first guitar slide . I loved it for about one month , then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces . I almost cut myself ! I will never buy a glass slide again , I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it . The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier , mellow tone , and glass is crisper , louder , and does not break . I would not suggest this to anyone . The metal ones are about the same price , they do n't break , and sound way better . There 's a reason ALL pros use metal ! The review below is wrong . Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger , all the way to the tip . You do n't bend your finger to play slide . You retune your guitar to an open tuning . Just thought I would point that out .	-1
Works as advertised but the keys are stiff . Pads take too much presure to activate . Nice that I dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.After the first few uses the USB socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless . Wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru Amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed . I had registered it with AKAI already so I complained to them and they sent me a new one . I had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.Not recommending this product .	-1
I bought this because -- hey , a wireless mic for $ 13 ? Why not ? I *might* be able to use this in a public address system -- the connections all work , and it makes sounds , but the static is unbearable no matter how much I fiddle with different , the adjustment screw in the receiver ... nothing works . The audio is always clipped . Do n't even think of using this for music .	-1
I bought this pedal as a companion to my Roland AC-33 Acoustic Amp . The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy . However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate . This is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch . The worst part is the leads on the battery connector ( 9 volt ) were not properly soldered or had shorted out . The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made . For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed ( i.e . all that has to work are two switches and a battery ) you would think that Boss would put out a better product . I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close , leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question . I would HIGHLY recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site .	-1
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs . the first day it was fine , if a bit sensitive , by the third day it was broken . cheap to buy , but cheaply made .	-1
Based upon some of the other reviews , I feel I got a different product , as it did n't fit the descriptions given by others . I ordered two of these , and both were very thin material , not sturdy at all . Second , both straps were not adjustable to 59 & # 34 ; . Both mine measured 45 & # 34 ; from strap button hole to strap button hole , fully-extended . They are useless to me , as my guitar , a dreadnought , covers the middle of my chest when I put it on . I believe I was given a substitute product , since when I ordered these straps , the price was just $ 1.00 , and now they 're back up to $ 4.95 as I write this . I 'm really sick of these Amazon substitutions . For what I paid , I wo n't bother returning them ... not worth the hassle . I will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars . Very disappointed . Warning ... if you see a price drop below $ 4.95 , do n't buy ... it 's probably not the product that 's described here .	-1
I bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what I found is that although it looks cool , it 's complicated ( which for a capo is saying something ) . The release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.Bottom line : If you do n't mind the extra effort and do n't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using , then maybe you will enjoy it . For everyone else , look elsewhere .	-1
I ordered this product to use for personal recording , and thought ... what could possibly go wrong ? I ordered it `` New , '' and it definitely shows signs that it not new . First , the package was stapled , that 's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened . Then , to make matters worse , there is a hole in one side of the fabric . When I order something new , I expect it to be new . Based on this product alone , I would not recommend buying from this seller .	-1
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase .	-1
Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light , cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging . I just did n't want to spend $ 100 on the Boss version , but you get what you pay for ! Another thing that I hate is it 's really hard to change the battery , unlike the Boss pedals . save your money and steer clear of this one . I also bought a Behringer power amp for $ 200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out .	-1
It did not perform . Looks cool , but thats it . Very large and inconvenient . Would not recommend this because I would not recommend the blue yeti .	-1
I thought it was my jack for a while , then I noticed it would n't stay in any pedal . There is no `` click '' assuring that the cable is in place ... and there 's a reason for that , it is n't ! Slips right out of every pedal I have . Not reliable .	-1
Nice looking gooseneck , threads are clean , fits well . However , the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic ( Shure SM58 ) without collapsing . Better try another brand , or spend a buck or two more to get a better product .	-1
Unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage ! I tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register . the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes .	-1
I even called Dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic . The guy at Dunlop told me `` oh yes , they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic '' . That is NOT the case . I purchased multiple units , and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than it 's worth . But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculpture ! Because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up , the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap , please reply to this feedback.What really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks do n't know their products well enough to be recommending product . It 's called , TRAIN your people ! ! !	-1
So heres the thing that no one else wants to say . The thing is built like a piece of s*** . It jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around . I used this 3 times and it shorted out . The lights started flashing and it got hot . I called line 6 and they determined it was bad so they opened a `` ticket '' . FYI if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line 6 . Not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc I could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on . I wish I would have never bought this but hopefully I get a new one soon . Well see how helpful they really are .	-1
I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store . Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string . Have 2 problems with the strings . First , the bass E ( 11th string ) broke while tuning it up . Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string ( not Elixir ) . I have changed strings many , many times , so I am convinced it was not my stringing , but a weakness in the E string itself . Second , the high D ( 8th string ) seems `` dead '' ; it does not `` ring '' as it should and as the other high strings do ( though none as much as other 12 string sets I 've used ) . Considering these strings cost much more than others , I certainly am disappointed in them . Hardly matters if they last longer if they do n't sound as good .	-1
This is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iPhone or iPad . But if you want to use it for any recording at all , even demos , I strongly recommend going for the iRigHD . The HD sounds waaaaaay better , and the build quality is great . This guy , not so much . There was always a bit of noise with my old iRig , and it seemed to get worse over time . It also felt kinda fragile and chinsy . If you look , you can usually find the HD somewhere for $ 80 ; a $ 50 difference is significant , but the jump in quality ( and likely longevity of the product ) is definitely worth it . I upgraded and would absolutely do it again .	-1
Well ... its a stand.. its super cheap and i do n't mean the price . the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back.. i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back . its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well . Instructions were ok.. came with more parts than what were required ... all holes filled and i have of of each part extra.. the guitars do not sit very well in this stand ... i will use it until i can find a better one.. it will get replaced.. i really should send this POS back to Amazon . the concept is great but the execution of it sucks . it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand.. there are better options out there for something portable . this stand is worth 10.00 tops ... if i had it to do all over i would save my money .	-1
The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings , for steel strings I want more pressure , I advise getting the NS Capo that is not `` lite '' , I prefer that one above this model .	-1
I tried this in front , in the middle , and at the end of an effects chain , as well as by itself , plugged into the effects loop of my Mesa Boogie Mark V amplifier . Whenever it is in the path , as soon as I engage my effects loop , the signal level drops considerably . It did not matter whether the pedal was on or not . The chorus effect is good , but I do n't want my volume to drop every time I turn on my effects loop . I have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that I use , so I ca n't raise the send any more .	-1
the cable hisses , crackles and pops right out of the package . save your money and buy a better cable . i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective . i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else .	-1
They say 2-4 months , I 've never come close to even a month . Usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks . If it sounds too good to be true , it usually is . I do n't recommend these .	-1
Be careful ; I have a small recording studio , so we put our cables through a lot , and these guys just do n't last . They were fine for the first few months , but then they started to die like a murder mystery . Seriously , one after another they would just go , for no apparent reason.Fine one second , and then it would just go horribly staticky . I actually had two blow at one time , and thought my PA was shot . Thankfully , it was just these cables . NOT GOOD . Spend a little extra on another brand . These have been my favorite : GLS Audio 25ft Cable Cords	-1
I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists . I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect . These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics . They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable . It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description . I wasted my money . Do n't waste yours . Perhaps viagra would be helpful ; - )	-1
If you 're a metalhead , STAY AWAY ! ! I tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey Rogue G10 blows it out of the water . This thing sounds like CRAP with anything distortion . It 's GREAT for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch . But if you demand metal , get far away !	-1
Far too slippery for my fingers when I shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well .	-1
As the title states , this is a lightly padded duffle bag , nothing more . If you 're toating between practice with an instructor , it 's okay . I purchased it for that reason ... and I 'm an adult , so I can be careful . This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage . I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag . It will prevent my guitar from scuffs , dings , dent & dirt , but that 's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price .	-1
Unhappy with it , actually I already replaced them . The method of attachment is poorly designed , it does n't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls , the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions . Expensive locks too .	-1
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago . Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body . I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass ... not good . My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there 's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that 's screwed into the body unscrewing itself . We 've tried applying bar soap , petro jelly , and a spray can based dry lubricant ... . none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing ' force.We tried to make the Fender/Shallers work but just could not . Maybe we 're all too active on stage but we can not tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us .	-1
The travel would be tolerable for a sitting position ... , but I stand in front of a mic on stage . The pedal generates a lot of & # 34 ; noise & # 34 ; so I ca n't use it . You get what you pay for . King Vox and Dunlop High Gain , both passive , have passed the test , and I 'm pretty picky !	-1
I have three mic stands , with this one being the fourth . I STILL have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible.1 . The top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down.2 . The bottom clamp never did secure properly . It kept opening up even without a mic on it . The weight of the stand itself stripped it.I sent it back without hesitation .	-1
soi f you want to turn Distor t off , u can not .dig ? it s always on ... alwaysif you like hard rock that wayu need this tiny gig thingie	-1
Ok its cheap . You knew that when you bought it . I really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture . It was only one and it was red . Broke with first use .	-1
Years ago I used the Clayton & # 34 ; small teardrop & # 34 ; picks . I could n't tell from the picture , that these were full size , and I did n't check the size in the description . I still had a few of the small ones , so I used them as templates , to cut these down . I would have rated them higher , if I could have used them as is . It 's my own fault for not looking at the specifications . I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks , but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm ( Orange ) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks , 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper .	-1
Purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock Martin and it just did n't fit well for me . Also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove . A string style worked a lot better , was a lot easier to attach and remove , and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed .	-1
Although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked , the attack knob ( the control for how much compression you want to apply ) did absolutely nothing . I even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting.Perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one , but none-the-less I returned the pedal back to Amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board .	-1
I bought this for my Canon Vixia HF G10 Video Camera and a Shotgun Mic that I recently purchased for it . I needed a 12 & # 34 ; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic ( which is mounted on the Mini Advanced Shoe ) to the microphone plug on the Video Camera ... The wire on this thing is *not* 1 foot long . the actual wire is under 8 & # 34 ; long itself . I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it was n't worth the hassle ... I 'd have rated it 1 star , but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 ( Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike ) and it worked out ok . Still a tight fit though ( since there 's only 8 & # 34 ; of wire ) ... I 'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2 ' adapter ; worst case scenario , you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it does n't fit.Also , not sure if it 's the wire ( so this did n't affect stars ) but I hear a hiss when recording . Again ; unsure if it 's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not ( or my shotgun mic ) .	-1
A great idea , but pure crap in terms of functionality . if you do n't have something heavy on the flat end , the rubber piece moves , and before you know it , your axe is on the ground . I saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight , but I 'm not so hot with that idea , especially if the can is open . The lip need to extend down longer , and *something* needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around . If I had a permanent place to mount this , I 'd gorilla glue it down , but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and I 'll get an extra guitar stand instead . Good idea , but it does n't work .	-1
I did n't expect this cable to be so thin . It 's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I 've used . Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference . If I had the foresight I 'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable . Still , it works and was inexpensive.EDIT : 6 months later and it 's dead already . Wire frayed at the right angle jack . You get what you pay for .	-1
I honestly do n't see the purpose . It does n't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar . I 've used it a few times , but do n't see the benefit.Edit 5/30/13 : After coming back to read the other reviews , it 's obvious what happened : This was shipped to me completely dry . There was no grease/lubricant qualities . It was like a dry erase pad . They need to improve their quality control . I 'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star . They HAVE to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.I would suggest if you receive this product and it has n't dried out yet , to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out .	-1
This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says , it distorts , You want something to make your guitar sound like junk , this will do it . Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me . This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use . Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.These things are built with heavy metal , it should last , I kinda hope it does n't ( just kidding ) , you want distortion , you got distortion	-1
A dull , inept version of a TubeScreamer . Just sounds flat and boring . Not very inspiring . At all . ( Then again , I never did really like TS 's ) ... ... .	-1
The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar , and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it 's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers . It 's cheap and easy to use . It 'll do the job , but I do n't like it .	-1
This is more of a toy than a good pickup . It functions but does n't sound great . What did I want for this price anyway ?	-1
Pretty disappointed in the color . As the review title indicates , what I received is more of a 'black chrome ' or dingy stainless color . These are simply not going to work with the MOTS pickguard I purchased them for . Perhaps they would blend in better on a black , black pearl or tort pickguard.I ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result . Perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad ' . Some are very dull looking . Very disappointing , really .	-1
I should have read the reviews carefully - it 's definitely something different , but not sturdy at all , rubber bits come off as you strum , and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers . Ouch ! I 'm much happier with my Friday the 13th glow-in-the-dark picks - that is an experiment that worked ! And who cares about hard pick sounds anyway ? If you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming , why do n't you use & # 8230 ; your fingers ?	-1
Stopped working all by itself . Fresh battery did n't help.Fortunately , I 've another , plus a Korg and an two Intellitouch . ( I 've 2 fiddles and 3 guitars ) The Intellitouch is simply `` champion ! `` .	-1
For some reason , this one just does n't hit the notes right . It looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway . I have tried it several times and it just does n't tune right . Then I recheck with my other brand and it 's not even close . Maybe I just got a bad one ? I like that this one shuts off automatically..but again , it 's WAY off tune.I did like the style , size and color ... ..but it does n't work right so it 's like running with a flat tire ...	-1
I have a Taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar . Rather than ruin the finish of the guitar I just got a different strap . Plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since I had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where I liked it to play . If the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made .	-1
The small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning . I have n't broke a string while tuning in 20 years , never ever had one break on the ball end.Luckily I bought the three pack.But I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
This gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an iPad or iPhone or a computer , but the particular one I received has a defective input socket for a 1/4 inch audio plug . It does n't snap in place . Just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out . That makes it fairly useless . I may have simply gotten a defective one .	-1
If you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static , non-oscillating , chorus like effect , it 's fine for that . As an actual pitch shifter though , this thing is awful . All the pitch shift settings sound like they 're 30 cents sharp . This is especially awful sounding when used as an Octave effect . I suppose I could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but I did not want to void the warranty so I just returned it . It 's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is . I 've read the same complaint about their Pure Octave pedal also . This is really too bad because all the other pedals for Mooer seem to be quite good . I own their Reecho Delay pedal and quite like it and I 'm also tempted to get their Green Mile pedal.If you 're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies , this pedal maybe fine for you but I doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.One minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals . It does not stick to the adhesive on ANY of the Velcro strips I 've tried to use .	-1
It was Not what I wanted . When A Person has a low Income We can Not afford what We can Not use . I was looking for what Is called Shimmer most Reverbs do Not have Shimmer as the RV600 Because Digitech called Shimmer , String Swell and Volume Swell Is linked to the Violin Sound It cost Me 30.00 Its called Slow Motion for a reason because It has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear It Is with Over Drive being played on the high Strings . It might be good for playing with a Bow , I have No Idea because I can Not afford a Bow .	-1
TC is very overrated.Many pedals I have out performs this in my opinion . The vintage BBDs ( MXR Vintage DElay , Morley 70 's echo ) for example just take it . But for newer pedals I liked the MXR Carbon Copy and Ibanex DE 7 much better .	-1
Good grip , but too flexible , and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks . Probably good for strumming , but not good for lead .	-1
It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp . Not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk . When received the package did not appear to be damaged , but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument .	-1
I am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ... First the positives : - Looks great- nice , easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice priceNow the significant disappointment : - inaccurateThe settings were on A-440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing , the tuning was sharp ... I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price ; however , since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products , they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner ( it has its place I guess , but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO ) ... I have n't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ... Bottom line , no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways , the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately , not only string to string but to a standard A-440 ... having failed that requirement , it is useless for me , especially in a band situation ...	-1
I 've been very disappointed with this tuner . When I 've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right ( sharp ) then back to the left ( flat ) . I have two ( 2 ) other tuners I bought from Wal-Mart and I always get accurate tunings from them . I bought this KORG because it 's a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation . Even though my tow ( 2 ) Wal-Mart tuners are older , they both still work better than this KORG .	-1
I do n't know who designed the leg feature of this thing , but they need to go back to engineering school . When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position , they 're quite difficult to pop open , and once opened into place , you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off , because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.It 'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place , and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar . I just do n't like the features of this stand at all .	-1
I have had 2 of these tuners ( you 'd think I 'd learn after one ) . They calibrate okay , it 's just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device ( both of mine broke this way ) . To me , for the price , it 's made cheaply . Try D'Addario instead ; love their tuners .	-1
I really wanted to like these , but they 're a frickin , lint-catching sticky frickin ' mess ! They went from my wife 's snare back into the holder in a New York Minute , have never seen the light of day , and may have been thrown in the garbage . Save your money . We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now .	-1
I really wanted this to work , but it does n't . Do n't bother , it does n't mute the strings at all . One star , just for it getting here on time .	-1
My problem is that I am used to playing Hohner Golden Melody and Special 20 harps . I guess I should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings . These harps have no volume . Do n't waste your money on them . I guess the only thing worth having is the case , but the case has no handles or carry strap.5/25/14 - I said the case had no handle , well I take that back . There is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat . I was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it . With one finger I can carry the case with my quality harps inside .	-1
Disappointing ; was looking for to receiving these.But ; mostly they are unplayable . Leak air badly . Easier learning bagpipes than these things.Save your money and get some harps that actually work.Decent case though .	-1
If you are looking for a 100 % leather mandolin strap , consider another strap . The outside surface of the Planet Waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part . I will be ordering the Levys `` Leather Mandolin Strap ( Walnut ) '' .	-1
The picks work well with bass , but they are just too thick to use with ukulele . The pics also shed easily , making your instrument dusty in no time .	-1
in the old days , we used tobe able to buyall 6 NYLON clear strings ... .now tis almost impossible ... .with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar ... .one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings ... very nice , resonant , and clean ... not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont know ... Again , like someone else NOTED the OBVIOUS > > > > > sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is GIGANTIC.This makes the move from the D to the G string too noticableCANT THEY EVEN MAKE 6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even ? makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally ... sucks bad now.oohthanks man	-1
The technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument is n't very friendly . Snark rotates to any position I want , but Intellitouch ends up being upside down . It works fine but it 's inconvenient .	-1
In fact , I do n't think this Hosa GTR215R cord lasted 2 hours . One step on the cord and it came apart . This purchase is the very reason why I 'm looking to buy a wireless system . Maybe if you 're using this to run a PA I would recommend it . But if any performer is hard on their cords I would n't recommend this item ... .but to be fair , I would recommend wireless to any performer . You 'll end up saving money over the long haul .	-1
I purchased these picks , because I play bass in an alternate punk metal band . We play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise . I was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise . They do n't make that annoying plastic to metal sound , but they are very flexible . I need to have alot of pick speed . These slow me down way to much . The other reviews I read stated that these were like rigid picks , but no they are not . Too bad as i had high hopes.Good picks if you do n't have to tremolo pick , not very good if do have to .	-1
These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG . All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars . I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out . Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place . Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky . They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below ! 2- Problems engaging . I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out . It was n't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in . Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap . They just feel cheap . Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers ; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I 'll stick with Schaller 's . I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail .	-1
This is my first guitar belt , it is not a good fit , the connection to the guitar is far too thick , I try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage . Other than that it is usable , sort of , but I am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead , the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with .	-1
I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings , they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret .	-1
Lets face it , in general string winders are pretty much all the same right ? WRONG ! I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name . What a let down . on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated , sure you can press it back together , but after separating several times on every string , it gets a little old ... .quick . Already ordered a different one to replace it . One thing I cant stand is inferior tools .	-1
I wanted to like this . I really did . The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think , & # 34 ; Perfect & # 34 ; . However , the unit I received was cr @ p , and I 'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions . The one I got kept cutting in and out . You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75 % of the notes or something . And when holding a chord , the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds . Frustrating.I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit . The so-so sound and overall quality however did n't compel me to give it another go . Bummer . Any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability ? Cheers	-1
From the product description , I expected something far more robust than this unit . By and large , I 've had great experiences with Behringer pedals , but this reverb unit is the wimpiest I have ever used in 40 years of playing - no stronger than the reverb in a 5w First Act amplifier .	-1
I give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do . I give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period . Generously , I 'll give it 2stars . Something like this really should last at least a year or more . Cheap parts/manufacturing ? 50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature .	-1
Do n't buy this Chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand . It is barely workable for two.It is easy to set up , but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place . And you absolutely have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.The best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back . For Les Paul and Strat type axes , their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow , stick like feet of the stand , especially when they are new . You ca n't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet wo n't support enough weight to make that possible . So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand . If you just got ta buy something from On Stage , get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced . But really , you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.This is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for .	-1
The velcro itself is insanely amazing . Its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing . If you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men , then by all means , use this stuff . In the end , you just ca n't make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board . Once together , it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably . I can not think of a practical application for this velcro .	-1
I 've ordered two of these kits in the aged white , and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate . Literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor , accidentally stepped on them , and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale . The knobs , covers and tips are all in great shape , however .	-1
I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together . I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews . The mute fits the bridge fine , but compared to a brass mute ( which of course works VERY well ) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing . There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on . Also , the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.If You want or need a mute for practicing quietly ( as many of us do ) , I suggest you buy something else . This item does not work and is a total waste of money . I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new Electric Violin bought here on Amazon ( FYI , that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item ! *Just make sure you buyThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsley & aGlaesel Self-Adjusting 4/4 Violin Bridge Mediumwith it ! ) .I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all . It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way .	-1
Bought this rosin to see how I would like it . I have a very light hand on the bow , so I like a rosin that is on the aggressive side . This is not . Since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial & error .	-1
Tuner works great . Both by vibration and mic.Only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak . Mine broke off ... not even a year old .	-1
Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top . A few months later , the high E string unwound from the ball end . Overall good strings , good sound -- this set simply did n't last very long . I will replace with 12s however . For me the 11s felt a little loose . The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box . I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model . I 'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s .	-1
A very boring , dull , uninspiring Pedal . Do n't waste your time with this . A Boss SD-1 or Digitech Bad Monkey are far better options for this price range .	-1
Barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer 's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do . I do however question whether the word `` Pro '' should apply to this system . Although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer , the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system . The signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about . To its defense , it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.After playing with the device for a couple more minutes , I noticed that any movement whether I kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and I moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception . Even the length of the mic cord , whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality . YIKES ! ! ! Perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which I previously described above . I 'm afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes . I 'll probably be returning this unit asap .	-1
I bought this unit for a friend , and I could compare with others overdrives I already have . I think the MXR Badass Custom Modified Overdrive or Way Huge Green Rhino are better choise .	-1
Really wanted to like this one , because I loved the price . There is no way this is true bypass . The one I got was defective out of the box , and so when I checked , I saw the circuitry did not support pass through . Maybe it is because I received a defective one , but I still would n't try this brand name . I am now stuck saving up for a Full Tone or something .	-1
I would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a Squier Bullet Strat , but the holes did n't line up , it did n't fit between the neck and the bridge , in fact , it was completely wrong . Nice quality though .	-1
Bought this because of all the great reviews , ButThis does n't work , just like the last Beringer product I bought . Will I ever learn ? Very disappointing.UPDATE- Now working ; got my mate an Aussie genius to have a look.Found pedal was n't engaging when pushed down.Took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on ; sheer genius.Worked fine with cover off ; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber . And it still works.Amazing sound actuallyStill not sold on Berhinger though	-1
I 'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing . They 're noisy , and the cables feel really cheap , gummy-like . Drop few more bucks and get something else !	-1
I purchased the H4n after being unhappy with the H2 's performance most significant where I could n't record a good sounding signal that was n't distorted with the Line In jack . Only to find that the H4n has the same problem but not as bad . If I try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the H4n 's 1/4 inch jacks , it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal . It appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp , adjusting the gain does n't correct it . I contacted Zoom 's tech support about the H2 and was told that I likely had a defective unit . I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviews.I really like the H4n 's design , the menus and controls are nicely organized . It feels more sturdy than the H2 . The recording quality using the built in mics is excellent . Most other recorders in this price range do n't have XLR inputs . Since I plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board , if the line in jacks do n't work properly and ca n't accept a normal line level signal without clipping , I ca n't use this for what I bought it for . I have used my Sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems . I 've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the Zoom products are the only ones where I have encountered this problem . If you are using this to record with mics , it works great , but if you need to record from line level sources , the Zoom recorders may not be a good choice . I exchanged this for the Tascam DR-07 and while the Tascam does n't have as many bells and whistles , It is a nice recorder and I 'm very happy with it .	-1
DOA ... no good , out of the box , plug it , nothing ... ..no way to send it back ( I ` m not from the States ) ... .meaning ... I just wasted away $ 40 something bucks ( add shipping ) ... .I did bought a Behringer pedal before ( Tremolo/Pan ) with good results , but I guess there ` s two sides to this particular low economy pedals ... .Well , I ` ll man up and buy something else ...	-1
UPDATED 3/16/2014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review.The 2i2 is a simple set-up . Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs , connect a mic or ( apparently ) a `` low-headroom '' instrument to it , run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters . It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program , and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton , but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless . ( Ableton itself is rather dodgy , and seems to crash constantly . ) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely , so as no audio is being produced from my monitors ! I was n't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR , an Ableton problem , or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers , so after the gazillionth crash , I screamed `` Ballsdogit ! ! ! `` , and purchased a license for Reaper . After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months , I began to realize that my monitors no longer `` lock up '' , but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic ! ! ! I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors . Now I 'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers . Garbage focusrite ! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins , and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface . I have yet to experience a crash , but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously , I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2 , and came across a response from David @ focusrite actually saying that `` you should not use this setup to record electric guitar.. '' , and that if you need to record electric guitar you should `` get something with more headroom like the 2i4 . '' That is just unbelievable in my eyes ! I 'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop , but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle ? Besides that , I 'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers ! This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins . There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation , and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit . I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer , now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology . HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING ! ! ! ? ? ? ? The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm . I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 ( when not crashing or locking up the monitors ) seems to handle all of them well . I constantly check for driver updates , and have the latest drivers for the 2i2 , but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite , you dropped the ball here .	-1

This cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric Hohner guitar . I measured the whole at 3 7/8 & # 34 ; , but this cover does not even come close to fitting ! It measures 4 1/6 & # 34 ; in diameter , so check your guitar closely !	-1
I dont know what all the hype is over this thing . The idea is good and its cute . Its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out . How many of these types of noise boxes do we need ? Not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it . Go buy a 20 watt Roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also . Or any combo little amp . It 's for bedroom use only . You have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire . Being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you . Just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot .	-1

I am a fan of Planet Waves NS capos , but this new one is not very well designed . The way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards . I find my left hand hitting the lever when I 'm in open position . Frustrating . It does have a pick holder , which can be handy , and a place to put an NS tuner , which can also be handy . I just think it could have been better designed . I do n't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff . I 'll stick to my other NS Planet Waves capo or my old faithful Kyser .	-1

Hi Folks ! OK , this thing is cheap . That 's cool . But a cheap item you ca n't use is money thrown away . Before buying this I had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it 's too small . Well , I want to clear this up once and for all . IT IS TOO SMALL ! Specifically , it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so ( depending on your guitar ) , AND it does n't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret , even on a skinny neck . This thing really is a puzzler . I mean , who the hell would make capos this size , especially when they could 've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price ? Someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid . HOWEVER , a positive from this whole mess is that I finally found a capo to use with my ukulele , and for way cheap , ha ha . But if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size , this is utter garbage . Cheers !	-1
This is a basic EQ pedal , that is a bit noisy in my testing . Even when running on battery power , there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs .	-1
Just assembly for a try , only few rolls with music , it 's had some hole on head , that 's mean bad quality . buyer beware for this kind of .	-1
Well 3 hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things tend to fall a part..however as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on..However I am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one..I bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songs..and it is a NIGHTMAREGoing on a week now no support help from either company..HEED MY WARNING IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS WITH NI , EZ DRUMMER OR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO REROUTE MAPPING OF MIDI IN ORDER TO USE IT . This is not a plug and play item you will spend hours of your time trying to get this to work with software ... There is very little helpful info out on the net i 've owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone item..there really is no MIDI support..Im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back.Alesis could have made this an amazing item and 1000 times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software..	-1
I use Clayton 1.26mm picks , a heavy pick but certainly not oversized . My picks do n't fit ! ! ! If I shove them in , I ca n't get them out . Also , this thing is huge for the back of the neck .	-1
The Good : This is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.The Bad : The tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination , unless you like hyper-distorted noise . The cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied . The effects are hit and miss as well . Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it 's downright offensive.Throw in the fact it chews through batteries , the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use , and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable , headphone cable , and power adapter plugged into it , I 'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones .	-1
I have been using this gig bag for the past few months . If I do the math , I probably did n't use it more than 10 times , basically from home to the subway , from the subway to the studio and back , so maybe 20 minutes walk each time . So I used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes , mostly carrying it on my shoulders , sometimes by one of the two handles.Then the side handle started coming apart : the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used . It will be OK for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking ( which I kind of expect at this point ! ) . Meanwhile I 'm going to buy another ( sturdier ) gig bag.Save your money and get something better than this .	-1
Man , this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks ! DO NOT BUY - it is a wast of money ... ug !	-1
I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product . A work-around for the main issue follows the review . The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1 ) Quality : Very weak soft-metal screws . Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with . 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later , causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2 ) Engineering : The instructions recommend , and the screws ( the ones that come with the straplocks ) are designed for a # 2 Phillips screwdriver . However , a standard # 2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons . So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit , or using a # 1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3 ) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar . The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch . Therefore any lateral stress ( i.e . weight of the guitar ) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw . A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it ( half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course ) . Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically , if the screws were n't total crap , this might have been a 3 or 4 star review . Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver wo n't fit and get the things properly installed , it would probably work out for most people . So if you are stuck with a set , here 's what I recommend : Go to a hardware store and buy # 6 x 1 '' oval-head stainless steel replacement screws . Note that these wo n't fit properly , but they are the closest match and can be modified . ( They are 21 cents each at my local stores , and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this . ) Put the screw into an electric drill ( pointy end in ) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill . Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head . It does n't need much . I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each . While you are at it , file down a cheap # 2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal , and recommend that your friends try a different brand !	-1
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home `` 12/23/11 '' and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset , i would not returned because i do n't feel like fighting with no body but they should n't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for .	-1

Well , what can I say ? Based on the customer reviews , this purchase seemed like a no-brainer . However , after only 4 months of light use ( used on my rig at home ) it is toast . The cable barely holds a signal now ( constantly need to jiggle the thing to work ) . And before you ask , & # 34 ; is it perhaps your output jack ? & # 34 ; , all of my other cables work with my gee-tar . So it is definitely the cable : ( Anyway , I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120 .	-1

I purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when I placed my guitar in it . Upon close inspection , the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube . The tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe .025 & # 34 ; wall , so do n't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off- even if it is welded better than mine was . Just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs- it is literally that thin of metal tubing.For $ 10-11 I did not expect perfection , so to it 's credit- it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars.This stand does have one other good quality- it is CHEAP ! Since it was less that $ 11 , I can not see going through the hassle of returning it . I was able to carefully weld mine back together- but this would probably not be an option for most . The stand might work fine if you do n't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but If you need portability and durability- I would definitely purchase a better quality stand .	-1

When I originally went out to place this order , I was planning to order the TC Electronics Singles VoiceTone C1 Vocal Effects Processor for its pitch correction function . As I looked over that device and some alternatives , I finally ordered the TC-Helicon Mic Mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects . I ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could TC Electronics put out the & # 34 ; Mic Mechanic & # 34 ; with a pitch correction function that did n't do anything ? Well , those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has NO EFFECT ! Also , I could n't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button . I kept the Mic Mechanic because I like the other effects , but I 'm very disappointed in the primary reason I bought it !	-1
The tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo I 've ever used - and I 've tried many over the years . But what was Ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem , including the pick clip and tuner holder , protude outward away from the fingerboard ? It 's awkward to apply and remove quickly . It 's visually distracting for player and audience , and it does n't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.The only possible justification I can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck - but even that does n't fly . Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and , unless you 're avoiding playing that first fret ( or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position ) you 're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand . I own the older Planet Waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.Otherwise the construction of the NS Artist Capo is superb . The surface is arched , probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various Strat fingerboards as well as a flatter SG/LP style . It does n't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1 which is virtually the same as a classical . If I cranked the tension it 's possible the rubber would flatten out but I would n't risk marring the neck wood.I tried both the pick and tuner clips and they 're functional , but to be honest I would n't use either - too distracting and I only use tuners to get an initial A , then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments , depending on what they are.The only other capo I 've ever used that protudes outward is the Kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence ' design . I have one and , as good as the holding action is , I 've never felt comfortable with the design . The older Planet Waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.To top off the confusion , the picture on the front of the cardboard card the NS Artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that 's impossible with this capo !	-1
I ordered this plug because it is advertised as a & # 34 ; 1 Spot & # 34 ; brand plug . It is not what I received . Instead I received a generic plug for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose , but a really cheap version . The plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 Spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic . The original 1 Spot plug has much smaller plugs , great for saving space on a pedal board , and the wires are soft and & # 34 ; rubbery & # 34 ; , again making it easier to work with on a pedal board , specially if you 're working with a pedal board like Pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars . I informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one . In my email to them I included an image of the original packaging of the 1 Spot 8 Plug to make sure there would be no mistake , but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug . I emailed them again for a refund , which they promptly did . I can say , that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money . I imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 Spot plug , would n't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors . I strongly recommend , spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 Spot 8 Plug .	-1
Does n't reduce sound worth a darn . I thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things . Muddies it up a bit maybe , but not really a reduction in dB .	-1
I bought one of these for a vintage Fender Showman that does n't have built in reverb . Put a battery in and plugged it in . Very simple . But the sound was horrible ! No setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb I ever heard or would want to hear . The closest I could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful . On the other hand , the reverb from my Korg AX-100G ( that I was using on another rig ) was great . Maybe my DR600 was not functioning properly , but I do n't think so . I think that 's the way it really sounds . So I got a return authorization from Amazon ( very easy - never fails ) , put it back in the box and UPS picked it up the next day and I got a full refund.JM Tepper	-1
A loud hum will crescendo in every few minutes even if the ground is lifted . Works great in intervals though , too bad those intervals are minutes .	-1
The material it 's made of is good , and it holds the guitar . The only things i do n't like are 2.1 ) Each of the corners has a cap . The one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off.2 ) The part at the bottom that looks like a U ( used to hold the guitar ) it spins ... It means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still , so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.I would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one .	-1
Not happy with the sellers description or the product . The description says `` Heavy Duty '' which makes you assume that it 's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip , but it 's not . IT 'S RUBBER ! ! ! It sucks . Used it a couple times and it 's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it 's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly , and flex . IT 'S FLEXIBLE ! ! ! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips ? ! ! ! Make sure you do n't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead .	-1
I honestly really did n't find this thing useful at all . First , the wire clipper side is relatively bulky ( no flush cutting ) and does n't open easily ( very stiff action ) , so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick . And as for the winder ... I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding , it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner . But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on , so no nice & # 34 ; tight & # 34 ; fit , more of a & # 34 ; jiggle & # 34 ; fit . Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table does n't help . Did n't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing . Just looked at it ... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.Each time I have set out to use it , I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string . I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters & Needle-Nose Pliers Set ( the pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding ) . When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar , I 'll try the notch bridge peg puller . But other wise , this thing gets a serious two-star & # 34 ; meh & # 34 ; .	-1
It 's really not a 200w system . The booklet even says it is only 100 watts , and I doubt it is really even that powerful . The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it . My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug . The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar , but it 's not 100 watts loud . I guess it 's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals .	-1
Could not get to fit small sound hole . Once in sound hole pickup did not work at all . Would not buy it .	-1
I bought this to use on my Fender P-bass . It is not reliable for me , sometimes it works and sometimes it ca n't find the low note correctly . I 'm still using my Roland stomp box tuner . Glad this was inexpensive , it was not worth the hassle to return , i gave it away .	-1
I used AC30 for years , lost them , and decided to make a change and buy these.Sound quality of AC30 was n't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains , but this one has a horrendous clean ( tried with my strat and tele , play jazz/blues mostly ) , and mediocre gain , you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers ( buying a 25-35 buck connector cable ) , though , granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.For people worried about CONSTRUCTION , these turned out to be very sturdy ( AC30s i previously used did , but the built/materials are exactly same ) .Even if you 're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps , go for cheaper models , or simply buy AC30 , the latter has acceptable cleans..	-1
I purchased this instrument brand new , on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that I simply could not ignore . It was brand new , unopened , in box . They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase . In that environment I thought it a nice instrument.However , it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store , and that store was VERY busy and noisy . It 's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.This is indeed a 6-string ukulele . It measures a bit over 28 '' top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke . I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range . The advantage to this of course is it 's 6 string , so if you 're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering ... . that is of course , until you realize that while it has 6 strings , it is not tuned like a guitar . It 's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE . One can not simply play guitar music on this instrument ; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned . Being a total newbie to ukes , this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions . So my primary purpose in purchasing this -- to have a small portable guitar , hit a snag.Now that 's not totally the end of the thing , because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning . It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one does n't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup . So all is not lost there . It was just an unexpected surprise -- mainly because I did n't research the instrument prior to purchase ( it 's rare that I impulse buy ) .So tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument . That 's where the Yamaha really falls short . This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand . There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box . That this was a `` rush job '' out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.There are no strap pegs ; those will require being added by hand ( not difficult , but extra expense and time ) .The action is of course too high . That 's not unusual -- in truth it 's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise . But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.However , the thing that bothers me the most : if I was n't aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele ... I 'd think it 's was a cheap knock-off child 's guitar . There 's not one thing about this instrument that says `` quality '' -- which is quite disappointing . This instrument sells for about $ 100 . That low cost is obvious . This is a `` cheap guitar '' in every way . I ca n't honestly say it 's a toy , but it reeks `` beginner instrument '' . The tuners are as cheap as they come , the finish is cheap , there is no decoration , no protective edging . The finish is -- unfinished.I bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon -- and I respect those reviews . People have different tastes and for some folks this has a `` home made '' feel that they will love . However I 've been playing guitar for ( mumblety mumble ) deca ... uh ... years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap . I own two Ovation guitars , a Peavey electric bass , a hand-made violin and an Epiphone electric uke ( which is of such higher quality it 's not even a contest . And no I 'm not hawking Epiphone . Facts is facts , that 's all . You can read my very-positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon ) .When I got this home and took a good look at it , I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship , nothing that said anything more than `` this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible '' . In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.Other than those two factors , one can find $ 40- $ 50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality . The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice -- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke . Other than its portability , I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price ... consider it over-priced ( or rather , under-made ) .One must grant it 's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation . But low quality is low quality . ( Edit two weeks later : I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store -- a direct competition to this instrument . The Cordoba is MUCH nicer . It 's built better , has better sound , and is finished out much more nicely . Sorry Yamaha , but facts is facts . Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side , I 'd have bought and kept the Cordoba . ) That 's my honest review . I know some will disagree . But others know exactly what I mean . This is n't an expensive instrument so one really ca n't expect super-fine quality at this price . However -- I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom . As mentioned , the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.Fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it . I simply can not recommend this instrument unless there are no better options -- and frankly , there are .	-1
Ok I understand it now - I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy , read cheap , interface to record some instruments with . WRONG ! I am returning it . It does not work , has no drivers and is not detected on my Mac ( my Mac finds everything ) . Bought the Focusrite unit instead . Got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings . Save your money and time . Buy the Focusrite interface or one of the others . Yes over $ 100 but you either want feedback , hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance . It also lacks 1/4 plug , one rca input , you need an addapter . Not what I thought I was getting - dumb me .	-1
The cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes . I don '' t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time I used it . The cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and I lost sound . This cable is complete garbage . Never again !	-1

For the price I can hardly complain , but unfortunately the item was not the correct size for a Fender Strat replacement .

I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars . One was in the SKB Fender case ( $ 99.95 on Amazon ) , the other in this Gator case purchased locally . I was told it was just as good as the Fender case . Both ended up in checked luggage . After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back ( non-stop , minimal handling ) the glue on the top section gave up . The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case . Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape , but after having the padding fall out , I just ordered another SKB Fender case . The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips . The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on .	-1

I 've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting . This one is the worst . The plastic screw ( yes , plastic ) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to , is completely incapable of supporting it 's own weight at nearly any angle . Bad ... just bad.Secondly , there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp . It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement . After twisting on it twice I stripped it out . Now the thing is worthless . I 'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady 's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing . Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6 '' pop filter . If you do n't , you 'll wish you did .	-1
I purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my Roland GR55 ( which has a flawless basic looper built in , but only 20 seconds record and no undo ) . I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I would n't need to carry a power adapter along.The factory battery lasted about 1 hour . The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes . I started recording a loop with another ( 3rd ) fresh battery ( tested 9.10 v with a multimeter ) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording , suggesting that it was faulty . The lights started coming on and off randomly ( record/undo/all three together , then off , then undo on , then all three on etc . etc . ) The first time I used the JamMan XT ( with the factory battery ) it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.I am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything , so I know it was not my poor technique . The main problem was that it did n't matter how hard I tried ( even if I did a manual fade out ) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start . This makes the unit useless.Also , it is poorly conceived in that , to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws ... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.The potential for damage here is very high . Also , replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board . To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible ( read INEVITABLE ) damage.I have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.It 's going back to the store where I purchased it .	-1
This cable was very affordable , but you get what you pay for . It sounded brilliant while it was n't broken , for about the 4 hours of runtime . It works if it is n't abused at all , but if you abuse it in any way at all , your out an XLR cable . I do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage .	-1
This stand is ok for light home use . I would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel . Very cheaply made but does the job . Guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot . You must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on the rack . Avoid if you can spend more .	-1
Pros : -Price point-Good , clean audio quality when working.-Changeable mesh ballsCons : -Limited upper frequency response ( & # 62 ; 8kHz ) -One stopped working after about half an hour of use . It was not dropped or abused in any way.-Requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than 10 feet .	-1
Did not hold the strings down very well for me ... I love the feel of it , but the spring needs more power .	-1
This is a fantastic product that is well made . The plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use . This ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.The tool is extremely useful . I have just started playing with a band , and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in . With the wheel , I immediately know what chords to choose from . I also know what notes are in each chord . In addition , it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.The wheel is also invaluable for switching keys . For example , say you 're playing the I , IV , and V chords in the key of C. , but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in Bb . All you need to do is dial the wheel to Bb , find out the new I , IV , and V chords , and start playing . The wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.I feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair . This is a very useful product at a fair price.No , I am not affiliated with the company at all . I 'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.In my opinion , this is a five star product .	-1
Go build your own . Build it to your specs and have a solid stand . If not , you can find a lot better head stands . This one was a huge disappointment . Does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick . Im back with my wood block and am happy .	-1
OK , it was cheap ( nine bucks at the time ) , the design looked good and sensible , and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need . I bought it without hesitation . HOWEVER ( ! ) , once hooked up , I was very surprised how flimsy it is . I have a 13 '' gooseneck , a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it . At the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand . Obviously , any small bump into the stand will once again set this off . Using it at home , I 've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful , but obviously this unit is far from ideal . Since then , I 've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand , and though I have n't really put through its paces yet , this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable , AND only costs a few bucks more ( On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom ) . For anyone considering this product , I HIGHLY recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom . You will be far far happier.Cheers !	-1
Compression/sustain wise , this unit is decent but I can not abide the noise ... I tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor ...	-1
Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago . Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body . I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass ... not good . My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there 's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that 's screwed into the body unscrewing itself . We 've tried applying bar soap , petro jelly , and a spray can based dry lubricant ... . none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing ' force.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not . Maybe we 're all too active on stage but we can not tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us .	-1
This particular brand I 've seen around and have n't heard to much about them , but the one that I got worked fine for about a couple days . It went out and I sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that I MIGHT have gotten a bad one.And I requested in a letter when I sent it in that they send another one in exchange , That did n't work out so well , with that being the only way I COULD RATE it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one , I 'd have to rate this one at the bottom ...	-1
I 've been using primarily Alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them . I figured I 'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.These were the first to go on , and they were a HUGE step down from what I had on . The strings I took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string . They were twice as loud as these . When you take these out of the pack , they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti . They do n't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do . The cons definitely outweigh the pros here.Pros : -Very flexible , string bends are easy-Easy on the fingersCons : -The most dull sound of any strings I 've ever heard . Especially on the low end . They 're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound . The highs are very tinny . Almost sounds like a bad recording.-Your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings . It 's the weirdest thing . This is especially true for the G string . It 's hard to explain , but it 's kind of like rubbing against something really clean , where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there 's tons of squeak to boot . Anyways , it sucks . Grip is the last thing you want on your strings.Bottom line : Unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings , these should not be purchased . I 'll never buy again . This is the first time in my life I wanted to change brand new strings .	-1
I know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here . The unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a RODE M1 mic or similar.I knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot , but I opened one , tried to use it and ca n't . It was a total waste of money , but does n't pay to return it . I suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it , it might serve your purpose . Again , you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands .	-1
I thought I could take the smell . I couldn't.Otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding.The case is nice too , but everything smells like the Chinese rubber smell at Harbor Freight Tools . ( sulfur ? ) I tried airing it out for a week with no success.If you have no sense of smell , get one .	-1
This system works just okay . Try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.My microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item . I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.They could n't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one , or where I could even buy a replacement.Very frustrating !	-1
Looked like the chrome was cheesey and they ended up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position	-1
My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good . I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good , but the finish was wearing fast . This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light . The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.But the sound is the problem . It 's terrible . They sound very muddy . Crisp tone distinction is just not there . I thought light would be the better route , but now I 'm not sure . I purchased some others to try . Also , since a purchased a 3 pack . I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings .	-1
These cans were decent , back when they were just above 100 bucks . They 've inflated to 160 and that 's just ridiculous . There is better in this price range . The SRH840 's for example on eBay for 120~ bucks new , does everything better than these cans . The M50 's have really punchy bass , and extremely stringent highs , they 're very loose in the low end , and their mids are recessed . That combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience . The pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable , whilst having an almost starchy texture to them . The headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath . These phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all , which means for gaming , these will be pretty terrible . They do some ... SOME ... new genres alright , but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to . They also ca n't do lighter genres like Jazz and Classical due to their poor positoning . There are much much better monitors in this price range than these , the Shure SRH840 as I 've said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas.Stay away , do n't fall victim to the noob hype .	-1
I own the SN-8 , which btw , is the best tuner I 've ever used . I bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin . So I wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin . I was also intrigued by the & # 34 ; tighter & # 34 ; tuning aspect of the bars on this . Let me tell you , if it worked , the bars may have been a cool feature , but when you are fine-tuning an A string and it tells you you are on E ( when you know you are on A bc the other tuners all say A , and it matches the piano ) , then there is a problem . I could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing , so it looks like it 's just defective . The one I received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great SN-8 ... I am disappointed in this thing . I must have just received a dud ( I hope , since these usually get good reviews ) , but I will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly . On the flip side , I will be getting another SN-8 in it 's place , since I know those are great tuners & I love the one I already have .	-1
No matter how many times I hard reset my 3Gs , no success . There is no problem with my jack , and the phone is in pristine condition -- no problems until now . There is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work , but that 's about it . I registered my Amplitude app , and followed all of the instructions on the box . I tested the iRig with an iPhone 4 and was able to get it operating.I am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend 's iPhone 4 . But for my purposes with a 3Gs , it is a brick . If anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation , I will re-rate the product .	-1
This thing is useless . Good idea , but way too light/rickety to be useful . Unless you 're constantly aware of it , 99 % of the time you 'll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it . Pass on this .	-1
I had a friend with one of these and he loves it . I got one on his recommendation and when I put the batteries in it , it started smoking . It did work for awhile . I pulled the batteries out and tried to AC adapter and it smoked again , this time it did not work . I am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work , holds a grudge . I would not advise anybody to get this .	-1
Dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly . Will never buy again even if only 5 bucks	-1
I bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps . If you want the metal sound for practice , then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill . But with the hybrid amps ( Vibro Champ ) going for not much more , you get better sounds and more settings . I am selling mine and ordered a Super Champ Xd used in new condition for two and a half bills . This Line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding . From now on its tube amps for me , even if i have to pay the price . A good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well , too . Like i said , for a first amp at one bill , the Line 6 isnt too bad . Maybe some day i will be able to afford a Princeton Reverb ?	-1
Tried this and was not happy . Seemed to want to be off too much . Got the Fender FT-004 instead . This one does have a great view on the LED , but if it does n't tune right , what 's the point ? I would try the Fender . Just a note . if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner . I would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing . Just a thought .	-1
I heard great things about the S6 and so , being a novice without any idea of what to buy , I bought it based upon reviews . I 've played it for a year , and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars , here are my ( humble ) thoughts : - The Seagull is comparatively unattractive . Its snake-head headstock with the tiny , not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top is very nice looking , and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars , and this makes the guitar heavier and , to me , less & # 34 ; alive & # 34 ; /resonant during playing.- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force , but at a heavy strum , the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I 've not encountered before.- I can get the action very , very low before the frets rattle - nice ! All in all , it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it 's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said , just because it comes from Canada does n't embody it with mystical vibes . In fact , for the price range , I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front , Sitka spruce solid top wood , better tuners , and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.I do n't regret getting it , but I feel like I overpaid for what I received , and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade 's exchange rates , I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price . Seagull to me is over-hyped.Thanks for reading !	-1
the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables.do n't buy this cables they keep failing , cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES	-1
These things are terrible . One would n't fit in my soundboard , another would n't lock in my mic . Plain and simple ... .if your looking for crap that does n't work ... .buy this .	-1
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good . Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless . Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter . I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open ( which oddly had staples holding it closed ) .	-1
It 's a decent unit , but stopped working completely after about 6 months . Tried everything I could , but it 's gone . I would not recommend this pedal .	-1
Just use a smartphone to record stuff . This is a really weird , not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones . Not really worth the $ 75 - I returned mine .	-1
the thing is that they do n't seem to stay ! i mean , you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic & # 34 ; arm & # 34 ; , but it does n't stay where you put it . and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality . but , i think if you 're lucky if just might get the job done .	-1
Like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off . I tried to glue it back on , but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that . If you buy this , you really need to baby it ! My advice is look for a more sturdy model !	-1
UPDATE : received 6 of these . 5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer . It was held by only one small tac weld.I got what i paid for . cheap price and cheap product . no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand , putting a $ 500 guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart . not worth the time & $ to send it back to amazon . One star only for this product . Good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this . Less than one star for this piece of ... ...	-1
First Behringer pedal I have returned . Almost no effect provided by pedal . I have returned the unit . Not worth it . Lousy pedal .	-1
If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a Guitar > Volume Pedal > Amp configuration ( inserting effects pedals anywhere you like ) , this is a POORLY engineered pedal . It ca n't be `` true bypass '' as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward.Anyway , the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable . The tone becomes duller , the output drops . I would expect that from an Asian knock-off , not from an A-list gear maker . I might be over-stating Ernie Ball 's reputation , though they make some fine guitars I got ta say , and I 've used their strings for many years.If you plan to use this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine . This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker . The signal processing takes place in the unit , not the pedal . ( Those units have their own tone problems but that 's another review . ) It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer ( NOT `` true bypass '' in other words ) may fix this problem , which is more than likely related to impedance , like a tuner pedal , between the guitar and the volume pedal . I will need to try that out , but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility . Major FAIL on their part.2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple `` first do no harm '' principle . It harms your tone . How dumb is that ? The pedal itself is very attractive , appears indestructible , though I have my doubts about their `` string '' mechanism over time . The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.I have no recommendations for a volume pedal . Because of the feel , and esthetics , I do plan to keep this for the digital device use , but wish it was able to do what it promises , and fails so miserably , to deliver .	-1
It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china . Any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell . If you can wait a month for delivery or longer , if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up . If you have over a $ 500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too . I have decided to build my own	-1
I have several MXR pedals . Every one is superb -- except for this PHASE 90 ( the non- '' script '' version reviewed here ) . This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean , for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion , a swoosh of sonic dirt . I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal 's distortion suggest some modifications . ( Look up `` MXR Phase 90 Mods , '' and `` Erik 's Corner '' will show you how . ) I made the `` R28 , '' `` C11 , '' and `` C12 '' modifications . The result : a slightly improved phaser , one that still churned out plenty of distortion . Finally , I tried adjusting the internal trim pot . On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it : distortion . I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable . No luck . BOTTOM LINE : IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOES N'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION , AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90 .	-1
These types of pedals are toys . They are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with . By all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing . If not , i recommend slowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay , or distortion .	-1
Sound is not so good . Strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything .	-1
When I purchased this I 'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar . Guess what ? As far as I can tell , there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with . This is NOT worth the money .	-1
From Greg Abrams review , entitled `` For all but the tone snobs , '' a review further down on this product 's page : '' Alright , so you want to get a good ( if somewhat `` basic '' ) distortion sound for less than $ 100 ? This is your deal . `` I strongly disagree . You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $ 100 or less , even a few near or under the $ 40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I 've played guitar for over 10 years . Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1 . Afterall , everyone talks about them , they 're available at any given music store in the nation , you hear about all these famous musicians using them , plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap ! So I snapped one up just like everyone else . Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR , that does n't always mean its GOOD ( see : Nickelback , the Transformers movie franchise , the Kardashian family , etc ... ) .So I plugged it in and did n't really care for it . The distortion was harsh , thin , artificial sounding and always noisy . I tried it on both my amps ( My practic amp : a solid state Fender Frontman 25R , and my big amp , the B-52 AT100 , which is a 100w tube halfstack ) It was was not very diverse , and the basic sound was not very likeable to me . I 've read the Japanese made DS-1 's are better in sound than the newer , made in Taiwan models but , either way , the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But , like many newer players , I did n't know any better at the time . Fast forward a few years and I 've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals . There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1 . All of them are great general purpose distortions , easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops , and can , at the time of this writing , be bought brand new for $ 75 or less here on good ol ' Amazon.com , and are rugged enough to last for years : Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion : Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I 'm a Boss hater ( I 'm certainly not , I loved the TU-3 , the ODB-3 , the MD-2 , and the XT-2 , among others ) I 'll start with the DS-1 's big brother . This pedal has a much nicer tone to it , not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes . The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1 , the II setting is a brighter , richer tone . As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity , you can find DS-2 's all over ebay for very cheap prices . A very worthy pedal , unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2 : Great dirty distortion pedal . Probably my personal favorite . You 've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years , its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists . Its a rich , full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy . I 've never heard a bad tone out of mine . Its great for getting a `` big amp '' kind of sound out of a small practice amp . Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume . A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff : The Big Muff is another pedal you 've heard on hundreds of songs . Its kind of a fuzz , kind of a distortion , but definitely owns its own sonic territory . Very big , saturated and warm . Used heavily in the 70 's for classic rock tones , also in the 90 's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage . Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins , Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White . I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff , not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue , its smaller , uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER ! A great pedal.MXR Distortion + : The Distortion + is a great first distortion , and can usually be found pretty cheap . Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything , and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent , i.e . you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp , it does n't cover over your equipments sound . Used by quite a few famous folks , including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia , Randy Rhoads ( Ozzy 's famous guitarist ) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal : Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal , NOT the Metal II . That 's a fine pedal as well , but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal . The Cool Cat Metal , or CM-1 , is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals . Basically , its a pre-amp that sits on the floor . It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof . So you can do anything from a clean boost ( with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone ) to high gain metal stuff , with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between . It works well with any amp I 've tried it on , and you can find tons of great sounds . Its an unbelievably versatile pedal , and its even true bypass . The best part is , Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them , so you can easily find one used or even new for under $ 30 . A true hidden gem that 's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion : This little guy surprised me . Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box , and , if so , that must be one awesome pedal too . Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box , and boy does it ever succeed at that . Great crunch , tons of volume and gain , it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin ' stack ! It even sounded good going into my modeling amp ( very few pedals work well with my modeling amp , and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in ) , and you can get a brand new one for $ 40 shipped , fantastic ! Speaking of Joyo , I 've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN , another Chinese pedal maker , and I 'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag ( especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I 've ever played through ) . So JOYO and MOEN , they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz , od , and dirt pedals , check them out ( and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company , please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review , DS-1 included , are made in America , let alone the western hemisphere ) .Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for . Also , if you ca n't actually try a pedal out at the store , YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs , than more power to you . Tone is subjective , every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps , and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love , that 's okay . My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information . You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals , the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that 's affordable . Find something you truly love and buy that . If its the DS-1 , one of the pedals I 've mentioned here , or anything else , the important part is that it sounds right to YOU .	-1
My first desk mic stand , and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use . It worked once when I originally set it , then kaput . It 's never worked properly since . I still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it 's at the right height . I would not purchase this product again .	-1
Sound nice , but very unreliable BX5a Deluxe.I own a pair of YAMAHA NS 10s and EVENT 20-20s , and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.2 years ago I purchased a set of regular BX5a 's , and they lasted about 1 1/2 years , and then the faulty capacitors leaked.I just replaced them with the BX5a Deluxe model , and after only one week . one of the Internal amps will no longer power up.I need a pair of affordable AV shielded monitors that I can depend on , and these Cheap M-Audio Monitors are not it.I am back to using my 20-20 's with slight AV noise until I find a decent AV shielded monitor.M-Audio was a much better company before Avid took them over !	-1
As an amateur musician , I 'm always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such . I thought this gadget would do the trick , but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just did n't meet my expectations .	-1
Crikey , where to begin . Firstly , I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet . Secondly , they mismarked one of the packets , so it appeared I had two & # 34 ; D & # 34 ; strings , instead of two & # 34 ; E & # 34 ; strings . Lastly , and certainly the least favorably , once tuned up , the strings sounded terrible ! They were tinny and clangy sounding . I 've never heard worse strings . Fortunately , I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med . light , as well . I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball 's and they were far , far better ! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product . I 'll never buy their strings again .	-1
I have an Epiphone Les Paul and this stand does not hold it at all . The holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor . Maybe it 's a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric . But given that Les Paul is a pretty popular model of guitar , this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand . I 'm rating it for what it is sold as , and for that , it gets 1 star , and only because since there is no zero .	-1
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day ... these have been ordered for a couple of weeks ... you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks ... i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day ... hope they work when they do finally arrive..good luck	-1
It 's simple , basic , but I do n't think it does that good of a job . This is because it does n't really humidify that much and does n't extend very far into the guitar .	-1
I bought this with the idea I was getting a pedal that would give me usable Marshall amp sounds . After trying for a couple of hours , I find that it wo n't do that . I guess my combination of guitar and amplifier was n't meant to be used with this pedal . The guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control , he was spot on about that ( very annoying effect ) . Nothing but praise goes to the supplier ( KDM Distributors ) . They did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country . But the pedal itself , not for me .	-1
I ordered one of these ( from MF ) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches did n't all work . Even in perfect condition it 's still a subpar case . But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid , and from those rips it 's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around , and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing . As for the latches ( buckles ) , there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed . The other two latched , but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.Disregarding those flaws it 's still obvious that it 's not a good case . The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment , the handle is not comfortable to hold , and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag . It also wo n't stand evenly on end ( if that 's important to you ) .On the positive side it 's light , it does fit a Telecaster ok , and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment . But do yourself a favor and spend another $ 25 and get something better . I have a Musician 's Gear dreadnought case and this does n't compare to that one at all .	-1
garbage if you like it ... then buy it.this is NOT how the world of music sounds.TOO MUCH BASS and other garbage ... are you guys really HEARING anything ? world has gone bass crazy since about 1981 ... more and more..we lost analog , we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp3 , and now to put morecrap into our ears , they give you ONEfrequency ... bass ONLY , take it or leave it.will go find REal headphones , thanks.kb	-1
Let me first start off with the sizing . When they say `` Fits Soundholes from 33.75 '' - 35 '' '' , they really mean it.You are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1/16 '' smaller than the specifications.I know I did . My friend 's Oscar Schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well . The edges did not `` catch '' completely and it looks terrible.My classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole , it did not fit at all . You could try cutting the edges off the Oport at the fretboard.The main issue is the sound.Yes , it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming , slightly but enough to tell.However , it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.Fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before , even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.For me , that does not justify it.A simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.Another thing I found out was what was Amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.The packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened . Does it matter ? In practical terms , no , not for this sort of item.I guess that is how Amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies .	-1
I have a real problem with these patch cables . I got them as a christmas gift but they do n't stay in my pedals ' input jacks without causing problems and having to push them in on occasion . Most problematic is the connection between my EHX memory boy and digital memory man ... never had problems with any other cables here , but these refuse to stay put without having to constantly adjust .	-1
Cheap crappy strap . It 's too stiff , not comfortable at all . I regret purchasing this ... Save your money , go hunt for a Coach strap or something similar . They are expensive but worth it .	-1
They only fit if you have enough room in your strap button , if not they will just pop right out . I threw mine away .	-1
I sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and I see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap , but I do n't know why . Maybe other people do n't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before . It was n't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds , but once I got it on it was stiff and felt odd . It was very uncomfortable around my neck and I took it off my guitar in a matter of matters . I would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap . Unless you 're just going for something that is inexpensive , does the job , and is n't designed for comfort .	-1
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap . No directions inside or on the box . I messed with it for about 5 minutes . I would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic . I read the description but it did not say cheap . Live and learn .	-1
I really wanted this to be a great product . The screws strip out too easily . Basically , if you put a microphone in it , and ever have to use it for a microphone , it is going to strip out . I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon . Nope . Even the pop filter fell off . I LOVE the design , but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage ... ex : adjusting the position of the mic , picking up a mic stand and moving it , etc . Otherwise , do n't have an adjustable tilt option . Just make it one solid piece . I 'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design . It 's just not strong enough . Not that it 's a surprise though . Not much of anything is worth the money these days . It 's a damn chore to return every friggin ' purchase these days that they do n't really have to care about actually testing products . Why should they ? They already have your money . I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up . Besides , what are they going to do ? Replace it with another broke a $ $ product ? Better yet , refund my money for the product I paid - minus shipping ? ? ? ? That does n't include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place . I want a refund , plus an hourly wage . Whatever , do n't buy one . Companies that do n't test their products do n't deserve your business . What would make me happy , is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question ( s ) : Did you test this product ? How did you test it ? What were your results ? Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence ? Nope	-1
Sorry Fender ... this one is just a waste of money . Get something better that does n't twist up an ravel into knots .	-1

This arrived and when I tried to use it , it turned out that the male threads were some oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapter.Instead , these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip , so now I have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck AND a clip.This is such a standard item , that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads , and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths ...	-1
I might have done something wrong ... I read in a review that these hold six picks.It held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart ... I 'll just keep using my pockets .	-1
I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2 . When I got it , I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal . As far as a CV controler ? it sucks at that too ! Why ? it squeaks as you move it ( after 5 minutes use , right out of the box ) . Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name ( although only 'conceived ' in Germany ) .It 's a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares . I 'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it.Also , you may say `` who cares if it squeaks a little '' ? well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a 'wah ' effect at low volume in the studio ! Good luck if you buy it .	-1
The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap , a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately . Replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand . They are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting , good enuf okay I guess . But after transporting and reset , I found them to be junk .	-1

My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply . I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board , and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply . However , if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested , you 're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all , regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board . The fitment to the power supply is there ... sort of . There 's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together . I was n't worried about this , since I doubt I 'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is , the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter . Once you 've got them in ( or attempted to do so ) , they 're never coming out . You 'll probably have to break them . It 's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this . Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board ( it can only go one place ) , you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply do n't fit the mounting location on this board . You ca n't plug them in because there 's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own , but given that it does n't fit like it 's supposed to , I wish I could return this board - except I ca n't , because it now has holes drilled in it . ( You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it . ) Basically , I paid $ 100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro . Needless to say , I 'm not very pleased .	-1
This was my first foray into home recording and it comes with Audacityfor free . Free is free , and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction . The interface is noisy , and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc . Sent it back after one day .	-1
I purchased this amp locally and initially , I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp ; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds . This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all , but when I played around with some of the `` standard '' models ( just the amp model , no effects ) just to see how it 's clean sound was , the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max . The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on ... I 've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it , even when there was no guitar plugged in ... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes ; very distracting and it drove me nuts ! This is n't a ground loop issue ( my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond ) , it 's clearly a defect with this product . Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse , again , even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume . You 'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil , but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS . WTF ? The next issue is the weird `` fizz '' sound , that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string , instead of a clean note , there 's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that `` surrounds '' the note , and fades as the string stops moving . It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency . Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is , neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in , or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in ... but I 'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans . I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12 '' Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites ( there 's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting ) and you 'll find that these amps are having issues . Apparently , the Mustang I and II do n't have these issues , and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp . Is this a hardware issue , software issue , speaker issue ? There is speculation that the LCD screen ( which is not present on the I or II ) may be causing problems , but no one seems to know for sure and Fender does n't seem to care ... Definitely try this before you buy it . You may get an amp that does n't have these problems , you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care ; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds , and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps , but in my opinion , technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage . I am disappointed that Fender has n't yet correct what ever is wrong ( some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong , but I 'm not taking that as a fact ... ) , but they have acknowledged that there is `` something '' wrong.Whatever ... I took this back after a few days of playing with it , trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success ( the built-in noise gate helps a little , but sucks tone ) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead . Guess what ? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz , even when cranked . How about that ? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels , there is minimal noise.I 'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it , but they do have some other nice amps that I 'd like to try . But before I buy another Fender amp , I 'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds .	-1
It is inexpensive but is difficult to use anywhere with other noise..I used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning , although probably would not be used by most musicians.. Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. I would not recommend it .	-1
I 've had it for about a month now and it has n't fallen apart so I guess that 's a plus , but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective , as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS . Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE . It 's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting , stay away from this .	-1
Second one I bought . Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months . Went through two of these before I learned my lesson . Do n't waste your money on this junk . I love Planet Waves stuff normally , but these are junk .	-1
Well this cable certainly did n't last long as the title says 8 weeks . Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago . Last night amp would turn on but was n't putting out any sound from the guitar . Messed around a bit and it started to work . Today same thing and it 's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp . Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and was n't very happy . Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either . At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $ 12 cord.Maybe I 'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I 'd return it . Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund . Will just move on to another company 's cord .	-1

While the product came as described , the build quality felt a little lacking . On the website it mentioned that it accepts the Shure KSM32 threading but it does not , so if you 're threading matches the KSM32 , look elsewhere .	-1
Both of the stands had parts that had fallen out , or were missing all together . When the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects , this is a major concern . It may be that I got a bad box that got missed by quality control , but it does make me suspicious of Pyle products .	-1
I was not happy with the sound of these strings . The EAD steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon GBE strings sound tinny . For an extra $ 2 I bought the D'Addario EJ45 Pro Arte and got a much , much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old Yamaha G-60 . Spend the extra $ 2 its well worth it .	-1
Could be a fluke , but my unit was defective straight out of the box . Plugged it into the Macbook Pro , fired up GarageBand and right away it 's MIDI connectivity was intermittent . Then it had some stuck notes . Then it stopped being recognized at all . It still got power from the USB bus , but no MIDI , no sound . The jack was visibly wiggly , too.So , you 're mileage may vary , but mine obviously had a defective USB port on the back . Rather than bust it open and get soldering iron , I returned it and bought an M-Audio Oxygen 25 for $ 20 more .	-1
This `` would '' be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity , it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum , pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you 'want a lot of reverb '' . What the hell was Behringer thinking ? ? ?	-1
It does not stick on to the guitar very well . Trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but I now have a small circle in the finish of my Martin . I made mistake of attaching so wife could play Rocksmith and now wish I had used cheaper guitar or better yet , bought a better pickup .	-1
Sounded good . Warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15 . I rocked all night and loved the sound . Next day i turned it on , my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out . I then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well . I changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock . Id like to see a real set of jjs , im sure one of them was a dud .	-1
Installed these on my Schecter C-1 Hellraiser . I had very high hopes for these , but as with any new over-hyped technology , they failed to impress me . The only good thing I have to say is the tone is good . But realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings . You would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison . So now that I have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse . They are not silky smooth feeling as advertised . If anything they feel worse than regular strings . Last but not least : they are bad for frets . Just like stainless strings ; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick . I do n't know about anyone else but I do n't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.For the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear .	-1
I have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem , but I got literally 8 plug-ins , and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain . It 's like I got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends . Soooo it 's pretty much useless to me . I guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them , I guess you could plug this into it but I really see no point . I would 've shipped it back I lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss . I think I payed like $ 8 for it so whatever . I would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end .	-1
I have checked this amp out twice , once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8 & # 34 ; version , with both a Strat and a Les Paul , and I am very disappointed in this amp.Now admittedly , with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7 , however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones.So , without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing ... Bottom line : unless you want full on distortion 100 % of the time , you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp ... . if you are committed to Orange ( and boy do they make some stunning amps ) go check out the dark terror ...	-1
I was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time , good though they were . Too expensive foronly one effect at a time . Returned it .	-1
The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously is n't going to last long . Also , trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I 'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it .	-1
Bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat . Does n't fit perfect . Kinda bummed but oh well	-1
Manufacturer 's website claimed that this case would fit a Les Paul style guitar . I have an ESP Eclipse . Not even close . ChromaCast products are great . They need to fix the info on their web page . I 'm not a fan of shaped Les Paul cases . Too bad .	-1
