Henry Winkler makes this delightfull Dickens variant a treasure of its own . ( In Blu Ray now - yes ! ) This great actor has always been a welcome see .	1
This was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid . Although it is tailored after Charles Dickens & # 8220 ; Christmas Carol & # 8221 ; , this movie has some distinct differences which actually make it stand on its own merit . I love the regular story of Christmas Carol , but this is refreshingly different and a must see .	1
Henry Winkler plays a great part in this movie , brings it to life ! Good modern version of Scrooge ! Do n't miss this classic	1
Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic . One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy . The general feel of this movie , though , is grey . That 's the best way to describe it . But then , it was a bleak grey time in American history , with the Great Depression and all . When Dickens originally wrote the book , it was a grey time in England 's history as well , so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern ' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.A nice twist ( sorry , Oliver ! ) to a true classic.By the way , for my money , the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim .	1
This is my favorite Christmas Carol movie . I have waited for it to come out , and when I finally looked it up again , I bought it !	1
Among the best of this beloved Christmas story ; We enjoy Henry Winkler 's twist on Scrooge and the story-line . He makes for a very believable Scrooge , both pre and post & # 34 ; redemption & # 34 ; !	1
Very well done , Henry Winkler is a smooth guy . Close to the original story line , so is fun to watch from an American perspective .	1
An American Christmas Carol ... based on the classic by Charles Dickens , & # 34 ; A Christmas Carol. & # 34 ; Now that I 've written something , you need to cut down the word number requirement . That 's really stupid .	1
to see how they take a name from bible ( JOSEPH ) and turn it in to a dvd movie to show how it was in the bible days	1
One of the best-done Bible movies ever , if not the very best . I 'm a pastor . Great acting ; great story telling . Pretty good regarding Biblical faithfulness . The theology in this has nothing objectionable , and I 'm a stickler on getting theology right , since that 's my job . Even the extra-Biblical stuff that 's in the movie is not Biblically-off . Great theological themes pervade the movie . Like someone else said , I could 've done without the bath scene . There 's no nudity in it , and something like this might have happened , sure ; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters . I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up . Do n't let that deter you from buying this , though . This is in the series done by Ted Turner . I wish Christians , in making Biblical movies , would be as theologically and Biblically accurate and excellent as this film . Bravo ! I love this movie .	1
This movie , JOSEPH , is in-depth and interesting . They put in some surprising Bible scenes that are n't usually included in the story of Joseph , but they do n't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes , so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar , so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture , though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor 's role . But it 's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it 's wrong or not . I 've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films , and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also , to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star , they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave . They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph . I never thought of that aspect , and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph , but it makes sense , after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed , especially as a youngster . I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant , spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery . It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah , Joseph 's brother , from Genesis 38 , which surprised me . Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph 's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph 's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah 's baker and waiter is interesting , in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD . It is 3 hours long , so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend , starring Maritn Landau as Abraham , with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah , called IN THE BEGINNING , which is also very good . It , too , covers the story of Joseph in a faster , more condensed version . IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events , but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT , the cable TV channel , under the subheading `` The Bible Collection . '' I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well . Actually , TNT is just releasing the DVD versions . I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990 's . There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years , of these LUBE movies . Look for ESTHER , JEREMIAH , and SOLOMON , as well . These three come in a money-saving collection called THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET , which is well worth the price .	1
Although I had enjoyed the Bible movies that were broadcast by Turner on TNT , `` Joseph '' turned out to be a cut above the rest in regard to the scope of the production , the writing , and the performances of the actors . It really seemed to capture the essence of the story in the book of Genesis .	1
A nice alternative to the classic . Can be used to get the point across but it is different that the Bible in some points	1
This is an excellent movie which I have used in Sunday School . The youth were able to envision the Bible 's narrative in Genesis much more clearly because of the fine acting and appreciative telling of the Joseph story .	1
I 'm always on the look out for quality films but especially for the holidays . I had seen this movie many years ago on television . I believe they made it into a mini series . The acting was wonderful . The story line uplifting . Great example of faith , hard work and being true to your beliefs no matter the circumstances and hardships .	1
Just what I ordered . No surprises . I am a pastor and we just finished studying the book of Genesis and w finished that book by watching this movie .	1
Very well done . Great acting for most of it . towards the end the main character loses me a little bit , but for the most part I like it a lot .	1
You will enjoy the story of Joseph , it 's very entertaining , it will keep you watching , what 's going to happen to Joseph next . The good think about the story of Joseph is where he ends up at the end . Good story excellent film .	1
This is the BEST THANKSGIVING special around ... and I am not just saying that because I am the RANKIN/BASS Historian . The sound on this VHS is magnificent and it should be on DVD ! I have the original GAS LP Soundtrack on CD . MAURY LAWS and JULES BASS did a wonderful job with the score . ELBOW ROOM , sung by TENN. ERNIE FORD was part of the RANKIN/BASS off-Broadway play A MONTH OF SUNDAYS , before it was put to GREAT use in this special ! A GREAT Special ! E-mail me with any questions : Rickgoldsc @ aol.com	1
One of the few movies kids can watch without mom worrying about inappropriate scenes or information . Perfect for the holidays .	1
Ordered as a Christmas gift for granddaughters . The shipment was fast and it arrived in excellent time , was enjoyed immensely and brought back a lot of memories !	1
It is a great video for the kids , parents and grandparents to enjoy at Christmas time : ) Hope your family enjoys it as much as our family does .	1
**SPOILER ALERT**I 'll bet just about everybody has seen `` Frosty the Snowman '' at one time or another , and I can see why it 's a classic . The animation may not exactly be top-notch ( let 's face it , Disney 's animation was far much better ; even in those days ) , but that 's not really what matters . What really matters is the music , the acting , and the story behind the animation.It 's the day before Christmas , and a bunch of children get together to make one big snowman . After some debating , they all agree on the name `` Frosty '' . They top their wintry creation off with an old top hat discarded by the magician Professor Hinkle , who is just about the worst magician in the world . ( He ca n't even perform a simple card trick , or get a simple rabbit to come out of his hat . ) The very second the hat touches Frosty 's head , the snowman instantly comes to life . When Professor Hinkle sees that there is some magic in his hat after all , he decides he wants the hat back . The children are simply delighted to be able to talk to and play with their new friend , but when the temperature starts creeping up , Frosty realizes he must go to some place where he will never melt . And what better place to not melt than the North Pole ? So , the children take Frosty downtown to the railroad station , and he and one of the children ( a small girl named Karen ) secretly stow away on a refrigerated box car on a train heading north . Now , a refrigerated box car really is a wonderful place to travel in -- but only if one is a snowman . For Karen , who is made of human flesh , it does n't take long at all for her to start shivering and sneezing with cold . Frosty knows that Karen ca n't stay in the car for much longer , so he quickly gets the both of them out the second the train comes to a rest stop.But even after they 're out of the car , it still does not do Karen any good , for they are now out in the middle of the wilderness , where it is bitterly cold . Frosty realizes that he must get someone to help them out -- someone who can get Karen home before she freezes to death , and him to the North Pole before he melts into a puddle . Hocus Pocus ( Professor Hinkle 's pet rabbit , who decides to tag along with Frosty and Karen ) suggests they get Santa Claus to assist them . But Santa does n't show up until nightfall , and aside from making sure that Karen is warm enough until Santa arrives , Frosty also has to worry about Professor Hinkle , who will stop at nothing to track the travelers down and reclaim possession of his hat.After temporarily giving Professor Hinkle the slip , Frosty and Karen manage to come across a small greenhouse , where a whole bunch of poinsettas ( tropical Christmas flowers ) are growing . Deciding that it must be very warm and comfortable inside the greenhouse , Frosty carries Karen inside . Karen protests that Frosty will melt if he goes into the greenhouse , and Frosty assures her that he 'll only stay inside for a minute . But once they 're inside , Professor Hinkle , who by then has caught up with them , shuts the door behind them and locks it . Now all the fiendish magician has to do is wait for Frosty to melt.Eventually Santa Claus shows up , and Hocus Pocus persuades him to help Frosty and Karen . While searching for the two of them , Santa and Hocus Pocus come across the greenhouse -- the very same greenhouse in which Frosty and Karen are trapped . Santa quickly unlocks the door , but once he gets inside , a terrible sight meets his eyes : Karen is down on her knees , crying her eyes out , and all that 's left of Frosty is an old top hat and a shapeless puddle of water on the floor . Everything looks hopeless at the moment , as you can very well imagine . Santa , however , assures Karen that all is not lost . He tells her that Frosty is not gone for good ; for he is made out of Christmas snow , and Christmas snow can never disappear completely . When Karen protests that Frosty was her best friend , Santa surprises her by using his special holiday magic to restore Frosty to the way he was before.Before they can actually bring Frosty back to life with the hat , Professor Hinkle puts his foot down and demands the return of his hat then and there . Santa warns Professor Hinkle to stay away from Frosty , and to never lay so much as a finger on the brim of the hat , otherwise he 'll permanently delete the magician from his list and never bring the magician another Christmas gift for the rest of his life . This insinuation hits Professor Hinkle hard , and he complains bitterly that it 's not fair , for even evil magicians have to make a living . Santa then tells Professor Hinkle to go home and write `` I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty '' a hundred zillion times , and then maybe ( just maybe ) he 'll find something in his stocking the following morning . Professor Hinkle agrees , and takes off for home as fast as he can , so that he might be able to complete the assignment before the night is over . Santa then places the hat on Frosty 's head , and he immediately awakens , much to Karen 's delight . Later , Santa takes Karen home , and then he takes Frosty away to the North Pole . Karen hates to say goodbye to Frosty , but Santa promises that he will bring Frosty back to the city every Christmas , and so he does . And every year from then on , Frosty 's return is always celebrated with a big Christmas parade.I 've watched this movie almost every Christmas for as long as I can remember , and I do n't think I 'll ever get tired of watching it . It 's really an awesome movie , one that the whole family can enjoy . If you have n't seen it , I recommend you do so . It 's a real holiday treat .	1
When I was in the first grade my friends from Pittsburgh sent us a mix video tape with several different christmas movies on it . This was easily one of the best . The movie starts at a class christmas party with a selfish magician ( Professor Hinkle ) . Then at the end of the day the kids build a snowman in the schoolyard . Somehow Professor Hinkle 's hat gets lose and the children find it and it brings Frosty to life . To make a long story short , young Karen thinks it 's necessary to get frosty to the north pole before he starts to melt . So they hop a train with a refrigerated boxcar to the north pole . The magician hops aboard and wants his hat back.Some parts are sad like when Frosty melts in the green house , Jimmy Durante does a wonderful job of narration and singing . It gets emotional at the end when He sings & quot ; Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way , but he waved good bye saying do n't you cry . I 'll be back on Christmas Day ! & quot ;	1
Great Christmas classic , always enjoy watching , must have for home to watch over and over .	1
Love watching classic Christmas movies during the holiday season . The Little Drummer boy is one that I remember watching with my parents when I was a little girl and I still love to watch it today .	1
The collaborative work of Katherine Davis , Henry Onorati and harry Simeone , `` The Little Drummer Boy '' is delightful retelling of a classic Christmas story and song wonderfully combined with the glowing , full-color illustrations of Ezra Jack Keats and the iconic music and vocals of John Jennings in superbly produced , flawlessly recorded , six-minute DVD format . A very highly recommended addition to family , school , and community library Christmas DVD collections , `` The Little Drummer Boy '' is also available from Weston Woods in a Paperback/CD format ( NPCD124 , $ 18.95 ) and a Paperback/Cassette format ( NPRA124 , $ 14.95 ) .	1
I bought this for my grandson . It was my favorite Christmas time show and , sadly , I have not seen it showing on TV for a few years now . He really likes it and watched it over and over .	1
Just as the creators of HR Puffnstuff left a legacy to the children of the 60 and 70 , s , Rankin Bass forever left some of the greatest treasures ever created.This Little Drummer Boy is not only a classic but can make you cry and get a lump in your throat every time you watch it.When the little Boys donkey is hit by a wagon he is rewarded by our lord who brings the donkey back to great health.if children today would watch these classics instead of watching the crap on tv or being on there cell phone at age 7 the world would be a much better place to live .	1
This has always been one of my Christmas favorites . And I have to admit I 'm a fan of Fred Astaire . I always loved dancing and puppets . This TV movie will please young and old a like for the Christmas season . The Year without a Santa Claus should be part of your choices as well .	1
Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town came to ABC first in 1970 , when Rankin/Bass was firing on all cylinders . The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable , especially with regard to the immense , detailed sets and more intricate characters , designed by Paul Coker , Jr . Yes , there is the same animation `` on two 's and three 's '' as well as a few modest effects , but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes , none of which seem padded.When I asked him to name a favorite special ( in The Cartoon Music Book ) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite , because he thought every element was perfect , from the cast to the script to the overall feel . Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special . Mickey Rooney 's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle . Keenan Wynn 's Winter Warlock was memorable ( especially when he gets the choo-choo ) . And our beloved Robie Lester ( read Mouse Tracks for more about her ) was the show-stopper when , as Jessica , she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo , a great tune in a score that has n't a dud in the bunch ( though sadly , in today 's more creepy times , `` Be Prepared to Pay '' may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation ) .Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town is so spectacular that it 's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty . And sure , it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.In this case , the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller , but I wonder if , like Rudolph , this special contains a nod to its cultural context . In 1970 , Richard Nixon was president , the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning . Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies ( since no town would welcome them ) , and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little . I even noticed that , when Kris says `` It 's not even safe here , '' they 're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it 's gone with no other mention . This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.Okay , enough with the term paper hypotheses . This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray.For more about Rankin/Bass and Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt , who helped save the peppermint mine scene.NOTE : If you have the original DVD of Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town , you may want to hang onto to it , though , because the Blu-ray contains no extras .	1
This movie is one of the great classic christmas movies . Really glad that I now have it on dvd , since I could n't seem to find it on vhs when I was younger . Added to our ever growing chrismas collection .	1
I bought this cause I 'm just feeling very nostalgic this year . It was really wonderful to see this again . The DVD is great .	1
We enjoyed watching even though we ordered late . Will enjoy for years to come . Great xmas story . You/your kids will love it .	1
wow , only if they had these videos back when i was young . My kids want to watch this from thanksgiving to about March every year .	1
I have such fond memories of this movie growing up . It is the story of Kris Kringle ... and is a classic ! A must have for Holiday DVDS !	1
I love all the rankin bass video 's I own all the christmas one 's , the monster party is kind of dull and the easter bunny one is good .	1
There are some things that take you back to your or your children 's childhood . This is one of those stories . When my son was little , we would watch the Christmas specials together and this was one we both liked . The actors whose 's voices you hear , some are no longer with us , but we can still enjoy their talent .	1
This movie was my favorite as a kid and now , as an adult . I was watching again today and realized that the Burgermeister is really my sister . LOL Who knew ?	1
This is probably the best animated Christmas story of all and definitely one of the most remembered . Who can forget about Sam the Snowman , Herbie ( I want to be a dentist ) , Yukon Cornelius , the Abominable Snow Monster , and of course , Rudolph . I have watched this every year for at least the last 25 years . But now I do n't have to check the TV Guide to find out when it 's coming on . I can watch it whenever I want . When I was young , I used to wonder if my toys talked ( wonder if this is where Toy Story got their idea ) . A perfect family movie that will make you laugh , cry , and be a little frightened . Excellent is all I have left to say .	1
If you like Christmas movies besides `` The Nightmare before Christmas '' , you should add this one to your collection . If you do n't like Christmas movies then buy `` The Grinch '' or `` The Christmas Carol '' and see what you act like Grinch/Scrooge . In my humble opinion this is the best telling of Rudolph 's story in a musical . Many added side stories with Hermey the dentist , Yukon Cornelius , Abominible Snowman , and the Island of Misfit Toys adds to make a great story . The animated figures are excellent and smooth motioned . Excellent narration by Burl Ives . The music is first rate and will have the family singing along .	1
i had to purchase this dvd ... i wore out the vhs copy i had ... television cuts so much out for commericals that it is a real pleasure to watch it as it was originally made .	1
Yes , it is still aired every year like A Charlie Brown Christmas , but it is still one of the best animated holiday specials . I have fond memories watching it as a child , but it has been cut down by several minutes by CBS so they can make a few extra bucks . I prefer to watch it on DVD at Christmastime .	1
`` Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer '' sends a Christmas message of acceptance , individuality , and the value of friendship . At least , it does after the last five minutes , when Rudolph saves everyone 's butts from ... er ... fog.The story begins when Rudolph is born . To his parents ' horror , he has a flashing red nose . When Santa , the cruel despot of Christmastown ( seriously -- in this show , he 's a jerk ) , makes no attempt to hide his disgust , Rudolph 's father , Donner , displays some dubious parenting techniques by forcing the young deer to disguise his luminous snout . Unfortunately , Rudolph 's shameful deformity is discovered by the other young reindeer , who laugh and call him names . One of these cretins is named Fireball - he 's got a single wisp of blond hair and freckles , so he really should n't be one to talk.When Rudolph is cast out from Christmastown , he meets some new friends : Hermey - a toy-hating elf with an oral fixation , and a finger-wave hairdo that would make Conan O'Brien jealous . Hermey loses his job because he wants to live an alternate lifestyle . How PC.Yukon Cornelius - a burly prospector seeking to increase his personal wealth . Interestingly , he carries a gun . Yukon helps Rudolph defeat a giant snow-monster . The monster ( who is white ) represents The Man , crushing anyone who does not bow to conformity ( by staying safely in Christmastown ) .Misfit Toys - a bunch of toys that nobody wants : a boat that does n't float , a train with square wheels , a squirt-gun filled with jelly , etc . Frankly , I think Santa 's workshop needs better Quality Control , if they 're turning out junk like this . Besides , I can think of a few seventh graders who could make the most of a jelly-gun.Clarice - a doe-eyed ... well ... doe , with Revlon lashes and a bow in her hair . She 's lovely and tolerant , and the most under-developed character in the story.While this enchanting tale is a family-favorite it fails as an origin story , neglecting to explain why Rudolph 's nose glows . It 's obviously a genetic mutation , but we never learn the mechanism behind it . Does it give off heat ? Why does it make that feeble whistling sound ? Is it any more horrifying than the fact that Santa can go from skinny to fat in the course of one day ? It 's also disconcerting that , by story 's end , Rudolph has reached maturity ( with tall , pointed antlers ) , but his voice has not changed . Perhaps reindeer puberty is unpredictable , but Rudolph is the only adult male who does n't sound like J. Jonah Jameson.Still , I recommend this Claymation Classic for anyone . Despite the flaws , it just would n't be Christmas without `` Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer ! ''	1
I do n't know what some people were sent . But , I got the original . It is just as we 've all seen growing up . I love it !	1
My wife returned from some Christmas shopping w/ the Rudolph / Frosty / Santa Clause is Coming to Town 3 DVD pack . While I had hoped The Year w/out a Santa Clause was among them so I could see the boys again [ Heat Miser and Snow Miser ] this collection supplements its cousin nicely . Both in our mid-30 's there is something comforting about watching Rudolph and remembering your childhood and past Christmases where the family would gather on the day this was being broadcast and enjoy Burl Ives plowing about as the nattily dressed snowman narrator . Approached w/ an adult sensibility , one really sees how disparaging if not outright cruel the mocking was on Rudolph and to a lesser extend Hermey . The misfit toys solicit ` aww 's as usual and we actually found ourselves rooting for the ultimate misfit , that poor prisoner of his station , the bumbling abominable snowman . That toothy visage was actually scary once upon a time . Rudolph 's personal journey and eventual transformation to hero is handled deftly and will appeal to people across the age range . The songs and feeling of nostalgia definitely make for a feel-good holiday viewing .	1
Do you recall the most famous Raindeer of all ? In 1964 Author Rankin Jr. , and Jules Bass created a & quot ; Claymation & quot ; production that involved , puppets , magic , music and great storytelling.Based on the classic Johnny Marks ( Ballad of Yogi Bear ) song the story tells the tale of the young Reindeer who grew up a little different from everyone else . And in the process makes some great new friends who are all different and have their own special abilities.Together they learn , friendship , teamwork and love and the real importnace of Christmas and the Christmas spirit . Amazingly charming and fun for the adults and the kids will laugh and cry and feel good about themselves knowing that being diffrent is often better then being like everyone else.Burl Ives ( The Ewok Adventure , Roots , Day in An Outlaw ) does the incredible narration and even sings the second signature song in this classic & quot ; Silver and GOld & quot ; . A wonderful ballad . Billie Mae Richards ( Care Bears , Spiderman ) is the voice of Rudolf herself . Stan Francis ( Spiderman ) is the voice of Santa and Larry D. Mann ( Columbo , Oliver Twist ) is the voice of Yukon Cornelious.The DVD Extra 's include behind the scenes storyboards , pencil tests and pictures of the original creators . There is also a deleted song that was not included in the original broadcast but added later in some versions . Rudolph trivia game.This is a great DVD for the whole family and fun to watch EVERY Holiday season . You ca n't help humming the song even after the show is over . ( 12-11-03 )	1
This BluRay is an improvement over the DVD . The picture is steady , and more importantly , the soundtrack has been steadied as well , eliminating the mistracked , out-of-tune mess of wavering pitch that plagued VHS and even earlier DVD copies of this show.Probably the best of the Rankin/Bass Xmas shows from the 60s .	1
Rudolph is a cute movie.Theres a lot more to it than the song ! watch out for the Bominables in this one . And Santa is a little skinny at the beginning ! But happy fun all the way . Good for kids who feel left out or different.Good characters , like Hermie the elf dentist , Clarice , Rudolf 's doe , and of course , Yukon Cornelius , the prospector ! ( Not at all like the Toy Story2 one . ) Nice family movie .	1
Bought this for my parrot as he loves animated movies and cartoons . He likes this one at Christmas time , and it is a childhood classic for us !	1
We were finally able to put the RANKIN/BASS name w/ a photo cover THANKS to Alexander Drosin and the kind folks at GOLDEN BOOKS and SONY WONDER ! The Extras on here were much needed and give the consumer much more for their $ . You would think that companies that release DVDs of this kind would naturally include extras BUT sometimes your assumption could be wrong ... .THANKFULLY not here . Hopefully , we will be able to add more material ( Check part II of my TVPARTY.com article ) and I will certainly discuss all the material in my new book & quot ; The Making of RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER : The Longest Running , Highest-Rated TV Special in History. & quot ; Visit us at RANKINBASS.com for more info and BUY this DVD ! This will send the companies that make these DVDs a message ... ..MORE EXTRAS ! and PHOTO covers ! Rick Goldschmidt	1
It 's a classic ! We do n't do Santa Clause in our house , and our kids have always know he 's not real . This is such a classic , that we 've allowed them to watch it over the years and they thoroughly enjoy it . Very cute !	1
This is one amazing show that everybody loves . The unforgettable characters and memorable music make & quot ; Rudolph & quot ; one of the videos my family never fails to watch each winter . See , I 'm 16 years old and did n't grow up with all these stop-motion , & quot ; Animagic & quot ; Rankin/Bass holiday special shows , but I do love them . For the longest time I watched & quot ; Rudolph & quot ; every Christmas and & quot ; Peter Cottontail & quot ; every Easter , but did n't know the wealth of other wonderfully great shows awaiting me . Luckily just today I finished watching the Rankin/Bass marathon on TV , and was introduced to some other incredible classics that I must buy : & quot ; Pinnochio 's Christmas , & quot ; & quot ; Jack Frost , & quot ; & quot ; The First Christmas , & quot ; & quot ; The Little Drummer Boy , & quot ; & quot ; Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey , & quot ; & quot ; The Year without a Santa Claus & quot ; ( the best one ) , & quot ; Rudolph 's Shiny New Year , & quot ; and more . I know most of the voice acting because I enjoy watching older TV sitcoms and game shows , in which all these 70 's actors and actresses starred . & quot ; Rudolph & quot ; will always remain a favorite part of my holiday traditions . The characters of Yukon Cornelius , the Bumble , Clarice ( Rudolph 's girlfriend ) , and Hermey , along with the songs like & quot ; Silver and Gold & quot ; and & quot ; Santa 's Elves & quot ; -- oh , and let 's forget the BEST part of all , those poor little Misfit Toys ! -- make this one video you ca n't afford to miss .	1
When a televised special like this one continues to capture the hearts of children ( and their nostalgic parents ) year after year since 1964 , it must portray an aura of `` timelessness '' in order to have such a long shelf-life . Well , `` Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer '' does exactly that by using the `` misfits '' theme to appeal to such a wide audience.For a basic plot summary , `` Rudolph '' sees the young reindeer with the glowing red nosed mocked for his differences and unable to `` join in any reindeer games '' . Without any chance of joining Santa 's sleigh team , Rudolph ( along with fellow misfit Elf Herbie , who wants to be a dentist instead of making toys ) embarks out into the wilderness himself , encountering an Abominable Snow Monster and a hearty prospector who helps him survive . Along the way , Rudolph and Herbie find themselves on the `` Island of Misfit Toys '' , an experience that encourages both of them to return home.Because every child ( whether perceived or otherwise ) goes through that `` ugly duckling '' stage in life , the themes in this little special are indeed timeless . The children who watched it originally back in 1964 and the following years grew up , but never quite outgrew its classic holiday themes , passing it on to their own children until it now has become a holiday tradition.What also helps `` Rudolph '' stand apart from the rest of the holiday specials is its Claymation format . There is probably a reason why Claymation is no longer used today in Hollywood on this sort of scale , but that rarity only enhances this show 's appeal.Overall , there are three holiday media events that I try not to miss each December : `` It 's A Wonderful Life '' , `` Frosty the Snowman '' , and this `` Rudolph '' . I can watch them with a sibling/child and introduce a new generation to the old traditions , or I can watch them by myself and rekindle those `` Christmases long , long ago '' .	1
Love seeing these cartoons in PERFECT re-mastered condition and bright colors . Over the years , they have aired on channels including CARTOON NETWORK in washed out 16mm prints . I would have preferred that the original titles remain , BUT at least they did put the original open to the series for each UNDERDOG episode . All in all ... a GREAT DVD set ! For this box set , CLASSIC MEDIA also re-did the covers for VOLUME 1 & amp ; 2 and they are much IMPROVED ! Rick Goldschmidt RANKIN/BASS Historian	1
This is a very basic cooking dvd , which I think is good for everyone , even if it 's just a review . I do n't consider myself a novice cook , but I even got some techniques and tips from it . I think just being in the presence of Julia is a good thing , like her teaching continues even though she is still not with us.The quality of my dvd 's are just fine , not sure why that other reviewer had issues with the quality . I wish Julia had done a series of vidoes . Now you can only get a few of the old episodes of her French Chef cooking show . Guess they did n't think of it back then.This is a great video for beginners and I think a great price , under $ 11 .	1
Cooking was a haphazard skill for me until I read Julia Child 's `` The Way to Cook . '' There are thousands of books that teach recipes , but very few about techniques . That is where Mrs. Child breaks from most cooking instructors and where she leaves an important mark.By explaining , quickly and simply , the most useful methods in the preparations of foods , she makes clear , with positive attitude , enthusiasm and reassurance , how the novice cook can prepare meals expertly.The accompanying video series , now on DVD , does not have all the recipes listed in the book ( that would take years to go through ) , but the techniques are all here , well organized and easy to master . I recommend both these videos and the book itself , for the latter goes into deeper details on how the theme-and-variation approach to recipes helps demystify cooking.Julia Child made a significant difference in my life . I am forever grateful to America 's First Lady of Food for patiently teaching me the way to cook .	1
`` The Passion of the Christ '' is a deeply moving masterpiece . It is entirely faithful to the spirit and , within the bounds of artistic license , the letter of the Gospel narratives . It contains not the slightest trace of anti-Semitic influence or message . Charges that it does are not merely false ; they are slanderous . Focusing narrowly and excruciatingly on His passion , this may not be the right movie to lead someone to Christ , but it is the right movie to lead a Christian back to the profound , piteous , inescapable truth at the heart of his faith : that God endured unimaginable suffering and death for my sins , and for yours .	1
Believer or unbeliever should watch it to see how He died for our sins . It is a sysmbol of His love for us . It made us not wanting do bad stuffs but to repent the sins . When you see it , you probably weep and look back to the terribly things you did in past	1
This depiction of Jesus ' last hours raises eternal questions , and stirs the emotions and the intellect.more than any other film of His life that I have seen.Gibson 's direction is inspired , and stays very close to New Testament scripture , with additional elements from the Old Testament.There are so many exquisite details in this film that despite its brutality , give it the beauty inherent in all great works of art . I could write at least 1,000 words about this film , but will simply urge everyone ( except children ) to see it.It is very violent , but so is the earth we walk on , with its earthquakes and volcanos , and continual wars since the dawn of man . I think perhaps some people find this film more graphic than the usual senseless savagery that assaults the senses in today 's films because of the meaning behind the scourging and crucifixion ; it is very disturbing , and it should be . There is no anti-semitism , any more than there would be `` anti-romanism '' . No one killed Jesus , He laid down his life . It also depicts extremely heroic and compassionate Jews , and priests who are angered by the arrest of Jesus and call it a travesty.The cast is superb , as well as other elements like cinematography , score , and art direction , but this is Gibson 's masterpiece , a magnificent work that will touch millions of hearts that are ready to hear its message.The DVD release ( which includes no `` extras '' ) is a rather dark transfer , at times not having the full range of color of the original . The good aspect of it is that one can see it as Mr. Gibson originally intended his film to be seen , with no subtitles .	1
Well this is one of the best gore movies I have ever seen . Pretty much that is what this movie is . 2 hours of a man being beaten and tortured . Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film . I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is . How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me . Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie . Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best . Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups . As far as content goes and story line , this is not the movie for you . There is nothing of substance here , nope just two hours of beatings and torture .	1
the truth as I know it , I cry everytime I watch this movie , great doing business with saler , was fast .	1
I have never seen a movie as intensley astounding in performance as that of `` The Passion Of The Christ '' . I am 39 years old and I can not find the words to express to anyone the expanse , magnitude and brilliance that this movie of The Final hours of Jesus Christ has left within me other than an imprint as deep within as the mystery of the universe itself.As a young catholic growing up , I remember seeing the movie on TV called , `` Francis of Assisi '' , starring Bradford Dillman , Dolores Hart ( who became an actual nun in 1971 ) and Stuart Whitman . It was and is one of the greatest movies in the history of Religious Film Making with The Passion of The Christ as Number One and Francis as Number two . No film of St. Francis or any kind then , made such an impression on me , that I actually took His name as mine for my Confirmation Name because I became so `` hypnotized '' , if you will , that I became more aware that anyone can desire such holiness and attain such ( Holy ) Valor as Francis did , for me , when I was only 11.Buy this film ! ! See `` The Passion of The Christ '' Come Alive for you as you have never seen anything like it ever before ! ! ! So that to see for yourselves what Jesus went through in His Final Hours for our redemption and to accomplish for us something so beautiful through such anguish and pain never before witnessed , that to this day , as I hold the DVD in my hands still unwrapped since I saw it on The Big Screen , it remains in me , as if imprinted on my very soul.Maybe a person may see this film as an atheist and leave it as an atheist , but I know one thing . They will never die as one , as it is said , likewise , that `` there are no atheists in fox holes '' .Peace of `` The Christ '' be with you ! RJ	1
Few films have been as highly touted or as deeply vilified as The Passion of the Christ , and for good reason . In America and the world today , the divide between those who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ and those who have n't has never been clearer . To believers , The Passion is a painful but ultimately moving depiction of the suffering , death and resurrection of their Savior . To non-believers , it is a violent portrayal of a mythical event.The film itself is well made . As remarked previously , the subtitles are not distracting in the least . Most viewers are familiar enough with the story to figure out who Mary is and who Pontius Pilate is . The cinematography is beautiful in most places and the film does n't drag on . Theologically , I found the film utterly lacking in anti-Semitism and a bit overly Catholic ( esp . in relation to Mary ) , but Gibson is a devout Catholic and this was his dime , so I was able to move past that . The extra-Biblical material did not detract significantly from the Gospel accounts to the point of concern.That leads to the much discussed and maligned violence of the film.It makes sense that the New Testament goes into little detail regarding the actual crucifixion and scourging . No one of that time needed a description as they likely had seen it first hand on many occasions . The reader of that time knew all too well the horrors inflicted by scourging and the agonizing death on a cross . To the genteel viewers of today , accustomed to stylized violence and gore being fed to them via CGI , it WAS absolutely necessary to show the up close and personal violence , inflicted by one person upon another , to really understand the pain that Christ suffered on our behalf . I doubt I will watch this DVD over and over again , but I certainly think that it bears watching again and I will buy it just to spite those who blindly opposed it without ever seeing the movie.I laugh ruefully at those reviewers who sadly try to make light of the Passion with crude humor . Not because they are funny , but because it is so typical of those who do not believe . I do n't find it offensive , but I am afraid God will . He will not be mocked , which I suspect will be discovered to the chagrin of the mockers someday . I find it odd that in a world that so values tolerance above any other virtue , mockery of the Savior of the world is still acceptable .	1
Passion of the Christ is a movie without doubt superb ! As an agnostic ( raised Catholic ) , I see the story told on screen for what it is - a dynamic story of a man in emotional turmoil and physical distress . The acting is superb , the writing is superb , the storyline is superb , the directing is superb . The movie as a story is superb , regardless of the subtitles.Christian believer or Jewish scholar , the storyline portrays the last hours of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , which foretells the basis of Christian belief : Christ dying on the Cross for the sins of Man and being resurected.Contrary to the Bolshevik nay-sayers of Hollywood , `` The Passion of the Christ '' is NOT anti-semitic any more than it is anti-Roman ( Italian ) . It is an extremely well told story from the New Testement , given the facts as we know them . There were only two major portrayals in the movie , Jews and Romans . What is shown is not one side against another , but rather the issues of the complex socio-political-economic times . Christ and his disiples were , after all , Jews in a Jewish environment , ruled by Romans.Do n't see this movie as an affirmation of faith , or as a racist , anti-Jewish story , but as a historical story of a time and place where bad things happened . If anyone comes away with a different , possibly more positive , point of view , so much the better.Whatever the view , this should not detract from the Judeo-Christian Canon of the Old and New Testament Bible .	1
There was so much speculation before `` The Passion of the Christ '' opened , and I truly believe the naysayers were just blowing smoke . Yes , it is a very violent movie , but not gratuitous Hollywood violence . After all , bludgeoning and cuxifiction are both extreme acts of violence and suffering and this is what is depicted in the movie . Mel Gibson did an excellent job . I would not recommend this movie for youngsters due to the violence . Very mature young teens may be able to handle it .	1
Some say this film is fixated on the suffering of Jesus , that there is much more to His Passion than pain . It seems unfair to judge any film for what it is not , instead of what it is & # 65533 ; namely , a physically graphic , agonizingly detailed reenactment of His final hours . Considering how profound and far-reaching is the message of Jesus , and how impenetrable is the mystery of His existence , I think Mr. Gibson makes a fine artistic choice in limiting his themes and thereby enabling ( forcing ? ) us to appreciate the magnitude of His sacrifice . Violent ? Without question . But violence is essential to the story . I recall & # 65533 ; Schindler & # 65533 ; s List & # 65533 ; and my revulsion at the depictions of utterly inhuman violence . Yet , to not see such a film , to close one & # 65533 ; s eyes to the message , is almost to deny the Holocaust . Can we afford to do that ? Holocaust survivors emphatically say & # 65533 ; no ! & # 65533 ; In the same way , how can we sanitize Christ & # 65533 ; s Passion and still come to terms with it ? If the violence of the film makes us uncomfortable , perhaps it is a discomfort for our own spiritual good . That being said , I found the physical brutality far less appalling than the dark sides of human nature Gibson so graphically portrayed & # 65533 ; the lusty sadism of His torturers , the calculating manipulations of the megalomaniac Caiphas , the mindless , reflexive scorn of the Pharisees , the debauchery of Herod , the crass moral relativism of Pilate , the utter indifference of the people , and even the temporary cowardice of Peter . It is far less unnerving to watch physical acts of brutality I would never think of committing than to watch these spiritual acts of sinfulness I commit daily to one degree or another . Yet , there is more than enough human goodness in the film ( to say nothing of the subtle but powerful portrayal of His divine goodness ) that I came away with great hope and a raised spirit . The devotion of the Virgin Mother , the amazing conversion of Simon of Cyrene , and the periodic flashbacks to inspiring events in the life of Jesus , show us that with His help and example and inspiration , we can see evil for what it is and begin to overcome it .	1
I 'll be honest , I was sceptical about this movie before it came out . After I saw it in the theater , I has a different view . I Thought it was a wonderfully done . It was a awesome depiction of the sacrifice Jesus made for the us . Because he loved us so much , he did n't want to see us all perish , but wants us all to be with him and the father in heaven . But we are sinful by nature and there is penaty for sin , but the only penalty is death . we would have had to all perish because the debt that is owed is far too great . So Jesus came to earth as a man to make a bridge for us to the father God , and also had to die for everyone so we would have an oppertunity to be with the father . Jesus did n't want to die ... I think he was actually scared and asked the father if there was another way . It 's an extraordinary story whether you believe it or not.I 've heard a lot of people argu that he was beaten too much in the movie and there was too much blood , I actually kind of agree ; however , I 'm sure it was a gruesome death and it probably hurt pretty bad.My biggest argument with the movie is the few things that mel gibson threw in that were kind of goofy . ex . The CG demon , the crow on the cross , satan with the baby , and the monster children.I think mel gibson is off his rocker and is pretty much crazy . Althought he can make a good movie , the guy is a paranoid crazy.But because of all the controversy of this film , I think it grants the right for your view . I recommend it because it 's out of the norm a different type of a hollywood movie !	1
Whether you believe in Jesus holiness being the messiah or simply a regular human being , you can not deny this movie touched you in a way . Many people do n't wish to understand that this movie is not about Jesus being tortured , but what he went through in his final moments on earth . Many also state that it is impossible that one can handle such beating and still be able to walk with a huge cross on its back . I did my thoroughly investigation after I watched this film for the first time , browsing through websites from people that have studied such brutal events like the crucifixion . I even watched a special documentary on the Discovery Channel when this movie was released in the theaters , regarding Jesus deaths and all events he went through and they all concluded that it was not pretty to witness it . Back in those times many people were crucified and they had to endure torturous procedures before being killed in the cross . And Jesus , convicted for ` swearing ' he was the son of God , might of actually tolerated a bit more than the usual.It was a movie that took a lot of bravery and valor from Mel Gibson to make , and that courage paid off with this great film which includes terrific acting and cinematography . ` The Passion of the Christ ' does contain a lot of violence and gore , something one must have in mind if they are easily offended by that subject .	1
Mel Gibson did a fantastic job in creating this film . I was in tears nearly the whole time , it really brings and shouts out the true essence of God and how much he loves his people ! ! ! ! I Love it , I Love God ! Amen ! ! : )	1
There have been many movies that I have seen throughout my life , but no movie has had such an affect on me like The Passion Of The Christ . I was born and raised as a Catholic and over the years , my faith in God and Christ has always been strong . This past weekend , my mother , father , and I took ourselves to the theater to see this film . After the movie had ended , I felt my faith grow so much stronger than ever . The movie is very , very graphic and gory , but that only goes to show you that that Jesus actually suffered that badly . Seeing how this innocent man suffered brought immediate tears to my eyes . All I wanted was to meet the real Jesus and just give a huge hug.I can not say for sure if I liked this film or not , but I gave it five stars because of it 's outstanding direction that was done by the famous Mel Gibson . James Caviezel gave an unbelievably incredible performance as Christ himself . If you are a Catholic who has not yet seen this film , I do recommend that you go out to see this film . If you are not a Catholic , I highly recommend that you go out to see this film . But I must warn you all , Catholic or not , if you do decide to see the film , I can assure you that you will be in tears throughout the entire movie . When I saw this film , I had a million tears streaming down my face . I even cried myself to sleep . Go out and see this film and you be the judge .	1
This is not an easy movie to watch , the beating Christ receives is difficult to watch.I fear it is very accurate . I would not let young children watch this.In general this is a Biblically sound movie that I highly recommend .	1
I just saw that Amazon is starting this new group of reviews , while it changed the other DVD reviews ( to VHS - even though it was for a DVD too ... come on , it was only a little over a year ago ... ) . For what reason ? There are almost 2,000 great reviews of this movie ( on average ) , but that is not represented here . I think the public will want to know , also.It 's a shame people are so ready to tear down a person who has made a mistake , rather than trying to show understanding and forgiveness . `` He who is without sin , cast the first stone . '' Lots of stones being thrown here , and I for one , do not appreciate it .	1
A FILM THAT RINGS TO LIFE THE REALITY OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY AND IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME . THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK , BUT FOR THOSE THAT REALLY WANT TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT REALLY HAPPENED .	1
Elicited by a controversial response amongst church leaders for weeks leading up to its ' universal release , Mel Gibson 's master epic `` The Passion of the Christ '' is definitely certain to garner huge receipt sales at the box office , as well as likely receive much worldwide acclaim ( and applause ) amongst moviegoers . However , `` TPotC '' is NOT `` The Bible The Movie '' , and should n't be interpreted according to any particular religious belief or doctrine . This is the main reason why such religious portrayals are viewed as highly controversial accounts , and much becomes muddled or lost when the plot or storyline is overanalyzed as a result . When `` TPotC '' is n't seen or viewed as an accurate account of biblical events , and is seen as a grand display of theatrics involving visually stunning physical scenarios not disguised as works of art , is when it results as a picture worth viewing many times over . And `` TPotC '' contains an exponential degree of props ( of both the physical and intellectual variety - which are prime factors contributing to the outcome of this fine , upstanding work of art ) . In conclusion , one must leave their theological preferences ( as well as religious prejudices ) at the door , in order for `` TPotC '' to have any real merit of entertainment value ( of which there is a high degree ) . Be warned , as this epic contains graphic images of violence . Language buffs will enjoy the eloquently spoken Hebrew dialects ( including the English subtitles ) . Please , by all means , view this picture with an open mind , and above all , listen without prejudice ( and ignore those blasted critics ! ) !	1
I received the movie within the said time , also received the movie in excellant conditions and will use them again , thank you.Dianne	1
Everyone knows what this movie is about so I wo n't explain.I 'm just very simply going to say that I loved the movie . I figured that a movie involving Jesus would have deserved a 5 rating on its own , but the Passion of Christ earned it .	1
This movie will make you think long and hard about what Jesus went through to save us from our sins ! As a Christian it put a lot of things in prospective for me ! It was heart wrenching to see the undeniable truth ! I recommend everyone watch this movie and learn the truth !	1
I love this movie ... It has a real sactifying effect on me each time i watch it . It reminds me of all the Pain and Suffering My Jesus went through for Me and everyone else..It also helps me remember my basic Aramaic studies too	1
The other night , I went to see Mel Gibson 's `` The Passion of the Christ '' again . I must admit I did n't like it any better this time . I thought that , on second viewing , the movie would just fly by , as so often happens when you resee a film . On the contrary , I found it long and , at one point , I actually started nodding off . ( Not during the flogging scene , I can assure you of that . I felt more distant and remote then , less viscerally affected by the violence . ) While I did n't like `` The Passion '' any better , I did come away with a greater understanding of the imagery Gibson uses -- more specifically , its roots in scripture . For instance , I realized that he was portraying Judas as mad -- possessed , in fact -- based on the gospel verse that says , `` The devil entered into him . '' At the beginning , when Jesus steps on the serpent and kills it , that echoes a verse in Genesis : `` He shall crush thy head , and thou shalt lie in wait for his heel . '' This verse has traditionally been seen as God 's promise of a Redeemer for a fallen humanity . The problem is , how many moviegoers today will be aware of these biblical references -- even Christians ? Gibson 's film is obviously a testament to his own faith . But he has made the assumption that everybody else shares that belief , and has thus made a film that , in effect , preaches to the converted . What about those who do not believe , or who simply do not know about Jesus ? Gibson 's `` Passion '' will not reach them because it does not speak , does not even try to speak , their language . The other problem is that Gibson 's version of the death of Christ is a hodge-podge of biblical influences , popular piety and his own idiosyncratic touches . Jesus 's trek along the Via Dolorosa reflects , not the gospels , but the Stations of the Cross you find in every Catholic church . Many of the 15 stations portray events not mentioned in the gospels . Again , how many people in the audience will be able to separate fact from fiction ? One final note : `` The Passion '' has been accused of fostering anti-Semitism , yet it tells the story of One who was Himself a Jew . More than that , His death took place against the backdrop of one of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar , Passover . When Mary says , `` Why is this night different from all other nights ? '' she echoes the question asked by the youngest male member of every observant Jewish family on Passover night . And Jesus 's Last Supper was a Passover meal . This is hinted at , but not fully brought out in the film . In short , Gibson takes too much for granted , assumes that his audience shares his knowledge of the Christian faith -- and misses a golden opportunity to explain that faith to others .	1
This is one of the best movies ever made . Like the Ten Commandments it brings the Bible to life on the screen so that you understand it better . I love when true stories become movies . This is a true Bible story , but I love how it brings it character to life .	1
A Respectfully done Version of the Life and Ministry of the ONLY Son of GOD , our LORD and Savior JESUS CHRIST . A must-see for all .	1
I 'd rank this movie right up the with the best of the slasher films . It is The Texas Chainsaw massacre or Faces of Death 5 of our generation . Just when you thought horrible fanatical death was only the perveiw of the cable news networks Mel Gibson gave us this gem of a gorefest . If you like blood , flaying , misplaced entrails and seeing a man brutally murdered this is the movie for you . Like other movies in it 's genre it has no redeeming qualities but unmitigated brutality all there for you to see . What more could you ask from a movie . Now that we have this on DVD we can all sit back and enjoy the ride at home . Grab a 6-pack , a pack of smokes and turn on the surround sound and let every bone crunch and death scream remind you that movie greatness still exists in the new millenium .	1
Mel Gibson 's film about the trasgression of Jesus Christ 's life is vividly portrayed in this film . You will see how a men crucify an innocent man who claims to be 'The Son Of God ' . He will die a brutal death for this claim , and History shows us that Jesus ' death has lasted a lifetime . The film and History proclaim that Jesus died for all our sins . The most selfless human act ever recorded by Jesus Christ and by God His Father.Infinite Stars .	1
This is a film I will never forget . Mel Gibson has crafted one of the most compelling works the cinema and the world has ever seen . This DVD is one I have owned for nearly ten years . I was n't ready to see it , until now . This is more than a movie . This is an experience that will stay with me until the day I die . Thank you Mr. Gibson .	1
I 'm 20 years old and have lived a life where I openly believe in Anarchy without knowing much about what GOD stands for . This and that and that is that but this is that kinda life.I constantly would try to punch in my logic each time someone would suggest something to the effect that points out their belief in GOD.After watching this movie on a Thursday night I felt a way I have never felt before . I was simpy taken aback to an extent I never thought I could be . I was shivering when it was all done . I closed my eyes and cried . I cried cause I felt cheated and felt wasted . I think it simply is the most significant film I have seen in my life . But then you 'd ask Why ? In my opinion , I think this movie portrays the history of the world . It symbolises what faith stands for . Its the greatest story ever told . ( I think the subtitle barrier which a lot of people very conveniently claim is there reason for not watching the film should be avoided ) Now I watch a lot of commercial movies but I think this movie was influencial in a way I cant comprehend owing to my limited comprehension abilities.I still do n't believe in God . I just do n't talk about it .	1
This movie was a real eye opener and shocked the world when it came out in 2004 . This was a well directed movie by Mel Gibson . It was very graphic as far as the torture scenes and crucifixion scene . If you have n't watched this movie then I suggest you do . It is definitely an eye opener the Love Jesus had for us and the sacrifice he made to wash our sins .	1
This film is so life-changing , I guarantee you you will never be the same once you watch this movie . It 's a breath-taking , emotional masterpiece that will be talked about forever .	1
I had much trepidation in wanting to see this movie for some reason , fear ? i finally bought it in 2005 on DVD it was very overwhelming and the most violent movie i have ever seen , it brought out such emotion in me in a good way though it left a huge impression on me and my faith .	1
'The Passion of the Christ ' is an extremely graphic motion picture that depicts the gruesome torture & death of Jesus Christ . I 'm not going to give a summary about this film because everyone should already know what it 's about . This movie was very dramatic , very emotional , and extremely unsettling . The film contains the most graphic scourging scene in movie history ! ! ! I would n't let your children watch this . Wait until they get a bit older . The acting is superb , the story , script , and characters are incredible . The soundtrack is depressingly atmospheric . Whether you 're a believer or not , this movie is well worth a look . You 'll walk away a changed person .	1
In a powerful rapture of graphic storytelling , Mel Gibson 's vision of Christ 's last hours on earth is shocking , disturbing and strangely uplifting in some ways . Shot in remote locations that are very similar to the harsh countryside of the supposed location of the crucifixion , the movie looks authentic with just a bit of Hollywood drama.The Passion is a tough movie to watch . It pains you with brutal scenes of torture inflicted on Christ as he is persecuted for his claims of being the King of the Jews and the Son of God . The anti-Semitic allegations really are n't warranted . I mean , c'mon , if he had n't been accused of being a Blasphemer , then he would not have sacrificed himself . The high priests feared the coming of Jesus because it meant that he could tell the people the truth , truth that they did n't want people to know . They did n't want a mad man to fill the people 's heads with fantasy , nor did they want to true son of God to make them realize what was really happening . In short , they would lose their place and stature as religious leaders . THAT is simply human nature . If Christ showed up today I have no doubt many Christians would doubt his authenticity . I do n't think God faults us for our weaknesses and fears , so I do n't believe in the end the religious leaders would suffer divine persecution.Back to the movie though , it is not just a religious revival of the death of Jesus . It is a story , one that many people already know so a lot of structural detail is left out . Mel Gibson instead focuses on interesting aspects , mostly in flashbacks , that you may not expect , particularly the mother and son relationship between Jesus and Mary . With such heavy influence on Mary and her struggle with watching her son 's death , this is definitely a Catholic 's perspective ( Gibson is a devout Catholic ) . But there is nothing wrong with this , it adds a very emotional impact . The lack of focus on Mary Magdelan is strange though . The one scene that flashes back to her stoning and Christ rescuing her from that torture is short and actually puts Christ in a heroic light . Once again , nothing wrong with this . It gives him a strong presence as if to say ` anything that happens to him happens because he wishes it to happen ' . One very good dramatic element is the struggle of Pontius Pilate to not have Christ killed . It is one of the best character conflictions of the story . Pilate tries very hard to keep this man , who may simply be delusional , from being convicted by a very angry crowd . He does n't want an uprising , but he does n't want to kill someone out of the crowd 's sheer hate . His final decision to release an insane and homicidal criminal is a last ditch effort to avoid the inevitable . Other than displaying beyond human endurance , there is n't much in the way of performance that Jim Caviezel can do . But he still plays the part well where he can . There is an especially good scene with his mother where he is displaying his skills as a carpenter , showing us how he must have spent most of his life making a living . The opening scene in the garden has him begging his father to not have to go through with the sacrifice , a very human reaction . Lucifer stands close by trying to convince him that one man can not save the entire human race . The action of killing the snake released by Lucifer is extremely symbolic and again puts Christ in a heroes light.The production value of this movie is very good . The cinematography is stark and realistic , but again a bit Hollywood . Being forced to read the translations can be tiring , I think some line did not have to be translated and the point could have been understood . Kudos should be given all around to the actors for learning what they had to of the dead Aramaic language . The CGI effects are very good , blended seamlessly with Jim Caviezel as he is whipped with an array of weapons . It adds a tension building element that makes you cringe and has you telling the purveyors of the beating to stop . One might even question if Christ could have remained conscious throughout the experience , being that he was in human form . But that is potentially a much greater argument . With all the hype that led up to this movie , I expected it to be more graphic . But as an avid movie goer , I did n't find it any worse then some horror movies . But it was more realistic obviously as to what would happen to a man if these atrocities were inflicted on him . Thankfully Mel adds a resurrection scene at the end to lighten the darkness , I wish this scene had been a little longer . I highly recommend the movie , not only as a powerful tragedy , but as an emotional drama that can affect anyone , no matter what religion , if they watch it for what it is ; a man who sacrifices himself for the greater good of humanity .	1
This wasnt about the Jews , or the gentiles . It was about the Son of Man coming to earth to redeem us , all of us . We had all sinned , we had all fallen short . Certain Jews & romans just happened to be the catalyst that fulfilled the prophecy ... They could have been any denomination , but they happened to be in power then ( all be it , thru the courtasy of the romans ) and that was what was used.I do not in anyway hold the Jews responsible for the crusifixion of Christ , nor do I hope , do other Christians . People were used throughout history to forfill a destiny.Even Judas fate was sad to me as it seemed to fullfill the phrophesy and yet was regreted almost immediately upon reflection.Part of the confrontation however , I believe , was to bring the gentiles band in to the fold . Through Peter and Paul . The think we must remember is God workd on a bigger plan than you and I.Sorry if this is preachy , its just what I felt .	1
Scholarly arguments about accuracy aside , this film gives an unflinching look at the last day or so of Jesus ' life . The depiction of his torturous lashings at the hands of the Roman soldiers goes beyond brutal . Even if you are well-acquainted with on-screen violence and have become a bit numbed to it , you will still probably react differently to this extended torture scene . It is portrayed perhaps more viscerally here than in any other film I 've seen or can think of right now.As to the controversy over whether this film will spark renewed anti-Semetic feelings , well that is another argument for another forum . As a piece of moviemaking , however , TPOTC is as brutal as it needs to be to get its point across , as moving as it needs to be to be respectful of the subject matter , and as controversial as it needs to be to generate broad and across-the-board interest in seeing the film.This is not Gibson 's first directorial effort , but it is his most accomplished and least technically flawed ( narrative flow , not content necessarily ) .Not only is this film unsuitable for very young children ( the violence may upset them -- this violence is realistic , as opposed to the cartoonish and overly-stylized violence they often see in video games or on television ) , but it will likely upset many adults too . But a good ( great ? ) movie SHOULD unnerve you a bit.This film is not made to be watched as much as EXPERIENCED .	1
Nice artistic rendering of the last days of Christ . Not really violent , but it had a taste of old horror films like RoseMary 's Baby and The Omen , in the scene of the Devil ? with a devil 's baby ? and also scenes of children turning into devil 's faces , that to me was the scariest part , Violence ? not really nothing horrendous like most movies out today , no real violence in this . Movie done artistically , and apparently Gibson has a real belief , because of the ruining of the Jewish Temple at the end of the movie makes sure of that . Other than that , you are not sure whether Jesus is a criminal or truly the son of God . All in all not a bad movie . If I sit through it enthralled , then ok , its a 4 or 5 rating . In this case a 4 rating , because there may be some racist attitudes towards Jews slightly in this movie , but all in all good well done watchable movie .	1
This is the controversial film adaption that details the crucifixion of Jesus Christ . Director Mel Gibson was under controversy from Catholics , the out and out gore shown in the scourging . The Greeks and Roman Pantheons crucified Jesus , they deemed him a threat to their society . No Christian should go without having seen this . I was baptized Lutherin and I view this as an essential film .	1
Of course it is ! it 's the story of the son of God , so obviously it 's not for little kiddies , people into heavy metal and rap or Executive producers . The story was good , although , I did feel Gibson did exploit the religious congregation a bit , just to make a lot of money ( unexpectedly ? ) ; which just means , he 's a normal Catholic man - just kidding dude , I liked the film . It was brutally honest - and if you 're going by the bible , historically accurate . I much point out , that the whole story is in Hebrew , so if you 're going to watch it , get the bifocals out to see the subtitles !	1
Controversy.Truth.Faith.Love.Hate.Lies.Confusion.Anti-Semitic ... One word summaries for what `` The Passion of the Christ '' meant to viewers all over the globe.It was a film studios rejected.A film that many award shows refused to acknowledge.But the public spoke when this film became box office history for sold out viewings world wide.But the movie is more than that.It is indeed like the title says `` A Passion ... '' It 's only ridiculous if you can say you loved or hated the film.Do n't think because I 'm rating the film 5stars that I loved it.It 's a movie Mel Gibson risked his career for and in return garnered only more fame for.In that situation I applaud Mel for his releasing of this film.But one can not ignore how it does show how much work and creation it took.Its beautiful scenery.The acting is magnificent.I do acknowledge this as work of extraordinary perfection.Whether the story is correct or not will always be up for debate among historians , philosophers , and the theologians for centuries to come .	1
Despite everything everyone says bad about this movie , like : it makes it look like the Jews killed Jesus , or its historically inacurate ; this movie is good . It is very acurate to the Bible , very extremly realistic in how he dies , and it does n't make it look like the Jews killed Jesus . In the movie , its a small group of high priests of the Jewish religion , trying to kill Jesus . During the priest 's trial of Jesus , one of the priests even comes out and says `` where is the rest of the consul ? `` , and they only push him away . Its very clear ( unless you 're stupid ) that the `` Jews '' did n't kill Jesus , only a small group of high priests , and some followers . It is also very , very , very acurate to the Bible , and it sort of combines all four Gospels . Another thing : this movie is very brutal , and the violence is very graphic ; from the scourging of Jesus , to the crucifixion itself . It shows his skin being ripped apart in the scourging , a thorn crown with the thorns being pushed into his head , his hands and feet being nailed to the cross , and him suffering on the cross . So if you ca n't take someone being tortured badly , or you 're thinking of taking a younger person ( around 13.5 and younger ) because its a movie about Jesus , do n't . It is very violent . That does n't stop it from being a great movie , so go see it . What i did n't like about the movie was , it should have done more on the resurrection . The crucifixion is a big part of the Christian religion , because he saved us from sin on the cross , but the resurrection is bigger . They only had a little part at the end showing the tomb opening , with Jesus standing up with holes in his hands . But , whether your curious to see what happens to Jesus , or a devout Christian , go see it .	1
This is hard to watch . What one man went through for the salvation of a world of sin . The one thing that helps you watch this is the fact that three days later this same man , Jesus , rose from death to live forever .	1
When I put this DVD in the player , I was mesmerized . I had to go back to the bible to see if he stayed with the facts , and YES HE DID . It took courage for Mr. Gibson to put money where his mouth is and make this movie . In doing so , he has made one of the most memorable pictures this year and for years to come . The cinematography is crisp , gorgeous and the cinematographer should be a shoe in for the Academy Award . The performances from Jim Caviezl and the woman who played his mother , Mary ... no doubt nominations for the Academy Award.I wondered if it would be anti-semetic and I watch with an open mind and heart and it was not . What happened to Jesus is what is still happening to humans today . We turn on each other . Jesus own turned on him , due to power , and we all know what power does to anyone , can we say corruption ? As for the Romans , the Jews were given a choice and they chose to free Bararabas and cruicify Jesus . Those people were swayed , and this is still going on today , can we say `` it was justified to invade Iraq ? `` This movie needed to be made , because in this time right now we really need to look at ourselves and those around us and say , `` is all this really worth it ? ''	1
Although I will never watch it again , I was glad that I went to see this powerful movie . It accurately portrays Jesus ' last tortured hours on planet earth . I give kudos to Gibson , who was brave enough to finance this movie himself , amidst much controversy . I would encourage all to watch this movie , at least one time , to understand why throughout the ages , thousands have been willing to die for their belief in a man called Jesus Christ.Yes , this movie is violent , but this world is violent , and Jesus did not come to escape the realities of this world , but to share in our sufferings .	1
This movie is sad . Of course , because he wants to see Jesus getting beat . But it 's something everyone must see once , and something to show to new believers to show what exactly happend to Jesus , but once you 've watched it , you wo n't wan na watch it again , because it makes you upset . A great movie though , everything is VERY realistic	1
Say what you want about Mel Gibson , but when he is making a serious movie , he knows what he 's doing.I thought `` Apocalypto '' was not very good , mainly because of its ridiculous violence and its quite one-dimensional portrayal of an entire culture . What was the point ? Mel Gibson seemed to be saying `` boy , these people were violent and wrong . `` But this sort of unipolar viewpoint , which did not serve `` Apocalypto '' at all , fits this film to a tee . Gibson is clearly a committed Christian of the Catholic stripe , and he has created pretty much the ultimate cinematic portrayal of the story of Christ 's crucifixion . I ca n't imagine a film which would better indicate the depth of the physical suffering that Jesus of Nazareth must have endured , and the emotional pain this would inflict upon his relatives and best friends.The sets are all very detailed and ring quite true to the period . The actors in lead `` good guy '' roles are perhaps a bit too European looking , but given the film 's production in Italy , some of this is forgivable . Either way , people have cast these characters with their own ethnicity for eons , so I 'm willing to give that a pass.I kind of wish some of the more mystical elements had been left out . Jesus heals a roman soldier during his capture . Judas is attacked ( in his mind at least ) by little hobgoblin demon children . Christ is also tempted by Satan - who is played and visualized quite well by a spooky-looking actress , but nonetheless this feels like a bit of a tacked on element , despite mentions in the Gospels at various points . These elements are at worst a minor annoyance , but they strain credulity , which probably runs counter to Gibson 's purposes.I guess I would have preferred that the human elements of the story stand on their own , because , frankly , that 's all we have access to at this late date . We simply ca n't trust miracle stories and talk of mystical happenings . We do n't have access to them . But by meditating on the human aspects of the story , we have something we can relate to and which may inspire faith in the other , less tangible things . To display them openly is to assume their existence before we are faithful.But this is just my opinion , I suppose , based on my reading , studies in philosophy , and my general skeptical bent . I 've never seen a miracle , and no one I 've trusted has ever reported one to me . Things handed down from 2000 years ago , re-translated dozens of times , do not strike me as reliable sources for amazing stories , none of which seem to happen in modern history and with the benefit of all the technology we have available to us to record such events . I mean , given all the cell phone cameras out there , where are all the indubitable miracles ? Anyhow , I digress ( my apologies to David Hume ... ) . Even with its mystical trappings , this film in its immediacy and its viscerality certainly succeeds in forcing the viewer to ponder the human aspects . The mystical stuff is a sideshow , so to speak.For those with faith , this film should offer a potent meditation on a story which has been ingrained into the psyche , practically since birth . For a non-believer , this film offers a valuable insight into the passion that believers have for this story and for the man himself . Like a Socrates , Jesus of Nazareth seems to have been a singular man , the like of which is rarely seen . Contemplating this can deepen a non-believer 's appreciation , if not deliver them into a completely faithful orientation to the material.To put it briefly , it 's a brilliant film . Each shot is lovingly composed , and the visual impact and beauty of the images ca n't be faulted . The performances all feel very real and there is no actor who takes the viewer away from the time period . Gibson , similar to some of the other great directors such as Kubrick , Scorsese , Stone and he like , excels at creating `` scene . '' You really feel like 'you are there . '*******The Blu-Ray : The picture is quite beautiful . Black levels are solid , detail is quite good ( though perhaps not the absolute best , I would say `` Dark Knight '' and `` Alexander '' top it ) , and color is very naturalistic . There is a bit of `` posterization '' in some shots of the sky ( i.e . a sort of digital distortion or dot-crawl ) , but it only intrudes on 10 or 20 seconds of the film , and is probably in the source material . The DTS audio mix offers some nice directional effects , with crowd taunts and bird chirps in the rear sound field.Technically , it 's about as good as I can imagine it looking . I did not see the film in the theater , so I can not compare the level of fidelity.Extras include commentaries , and a `` recut '' version , which apparently is actually a bit shorter than the theatrical release . This version also cuts a bit of violence . A word to parents - cutting five minutes of gruesome violence leaves about , oh , 120 minutes of gruesome violence remaining in the movie . So plan accordingly insofar as your children can tolerate these kinds of things . Other extras : There are several commentaries on the main disc . The extra disc has many short documentaries on both production issues and historical context , though none are in HD , unfortunately . *********So should you buy it ? Well , that 's a tough question . If you 're a devoted Christian who enjoys pondering these mysteries , and you also have a good HD setup , then sure , I ca n't see any reason not to . If you are not a Christian but are curious about what the hub-bub is about , then this is definitely worth at least a rental . Fans of historical fiction/docudrama will certainly find much to appreciate.Whether or not you buy it , this is definitely a film everyone should see at least once . It is a great film , like it or lump it . It is a vivid and very impactful telling of one of the very few central stories of our global culture . Keep in mind I do not want to put a Christian gloss on humanity here - if there were comparable films on Mohammad ( a bit of an issue given the icon prohibition ) , Buddha , etc. , I would recommend seeing those as well.On the whole , by any standards , this is a five-star release . It may not be for everyone 's permanent collection . But those who add this Blu-Ray title to their shelf will not be disappointed .	1
Jesus Quotes : `` Love one another as you have loved me , so love one another . '' If you can get past the outlandish violence in this film , you 'll see what that quote means.THE PLOTMel Gibson 's crowning acheivement is about the last 12 hours of Jesus 's life.THE CRITICSI will always see why people like this film , but the bigger challenge is hating the film . `` The Passion Of The Christ '' is the most controversial film of this century , but I respect the people who do n't like this film . 1 . It 's not as acurate as some people may think . 2 . The violence obviously . 3 . The crucifixion and his death.One of the last scenes is the crucifixion . This scene is enough to give you a heart attack . As he remembers his last words he said to his friends , the nail pierces into his skin and the rest you already know . His last words as their nailing him to the cross , `` They know not what they do , they know not what they do . '' This scene will inprint itself in my mind for years to come , this scene makes me realize that Christ died for us and thats all there is . He was born to die , he lived cause he was going to die for us , to redeem us .	1
The story of Christ and his last days on earth has been the subject of movies for as long as there have been movies . And most of these films , except for Martin Scorsese 's `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' have been exceedingly reverent and unfortunately hokey : films that were made mostly to tap into a ready-made audience of the devout and purposely not meant to cause a stir and therefore ignoring what it was that made Jesus the revolutionary man that he was . A Man that was as conflicted about we humans as we are about ourselves.One of the best things about Mel Gibson 's `` The Passion of the Christ '' is that it shows Christ not only as a Spiritual man but as a man whose time on earth was spent as , not only a leader , but as a dedicated son , an expert craftsman and a kind and loving friend to his disciples . He was the ultimate human being after all and Gibson captures this side of Christ amazingly well . `` The Passion of the Christ '' also raises as many questions as it attempts to answer and this is on the plus side . But several things about it are too tame : the music for one is dreadful : all soaring voices , and Middle Eastern doodling cheapens the effect of the visuals . The music should have been spare and lean , used mainly to quietly underscore the inherent drama of the story . Another minus is the use of Aramaic and Latin instead of English or some other modern language . Authentic or not , all this does is telescope the story away from us rather than bringing it as close to us as possible.The incessant brutalizing of Christ is graphic to say the least and even though I had to turn away from the screen on several occasions ; I felt that the violence was ultimately cathartic and dramatically truthful . Remember this a film , after all : a drama based on the Bible and interpreted by Gibson and his screenwriter . The purpose of this film is to dramatize , i.e . tell its story in an effective , truthful and honest a manner as possible.The issues with Gibson using this story to primarily implicate the Jews as the primary assassins of Christ are ludicrous : they had a part because they felt Jesus was a threat but equally to blame was Pilate and most of the Romans and almost everyone else including Judas , Peter and Jesus himself . The only people that seemingly escape Gibson 's blame are Mary and Mary Magdalene . In fact one of the most touching scenes in this film shows Mary placing her ear to a stone road to listen for her son 's heartbeat as he hangs handcuffed to a pole below . `` The Passion of the Christ '' is not perfect , but it is honest and caring and comes from a place of Love . And because it so personal and emotional , so much of the Light , it will be praised and reviled for many years to come .	1
Much has been said about this movie and you 've probably heard all you need to hear about it . To me , it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie . It has heart ; it 's brutal , poignant , moving , and heart breaking . It 's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ . Was it anti-Semitic ? I did n't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion , my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself .	1
This is one of those rarest of films whose trajectory penetrates all of the intermediary sensory and cultural tissues and impacts the fibers of one 's soul . It is not seen and heard , it is felt . It is nearly perfect in its power of telling.Whether deist , theist , agnostic or atheist , the viewer may briefly taste the sum of all the world 's pain . The experience may engender knowledge ; and with this knowledge , the beginning of wisdom ?	1
Honestly to say the least i thought this movie was going to be an ok movie , something to watch when it comes out on dvd or cable . but my cousins had invited me to the movies , who were going to pay for me so i went . this movie was so emotional . anyone who doesnt feel any emotion to this movie , is absolutely heartless . i recommend seeing , but not constantly . maybe once in a long while , its not a movie to keep watching over and over but a good movie to own . I without a doubt give this movie 5 stars . Great job Mr. Gibson on a directorial accomplishment .	1
I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD . I just noticed I have not rated it so I will do that now . Watch the movie if you have not seen it . Everyone needs to know what our Savior went thru to pay for our sins ... . when He was innocent of all sins . Jesus suffered horribly for the sins of mankind . All we need to do is ask Jesus to forgive us of our sins and save our soul . He made that possible for us by taking on our sins . Watch the movie . Please !	1
With all due respect to the media reporting on this major art film I was surprised to find myself witnessing a movie that simply obliterated the ` gore ' boundaries set by horror classics such as `` Last House on the Left '' , `` Dead Alive/Brain Dead '' , `` The Texas Chainsaw Massacre '' , `` Cannibal Holocaust '' , `` Cannibal Ferox '' , `` Faces of Death '' and `` Men Behind the Sun '' . Next to `` Irreversible '' this film is probably the only real shocker to come out in years . If the subject matter had been anything other than the trial and execution of Jesus Christ it would hard to image this getting a release in most countries . In fact Sunday school is about to take a very brutal twist that even the most seasoned of `` gore-hounds '' will have trouble stomaching.Here , in The Passion of the Christ , Mel Gibson gives us 127 minutes of non-stop graphic and violent torture sequences . Once the screaming starts it DOES NOT STOP ! It has been a long time since cinema has driven home such powerful and disturbing imagery . In one sequence a huge visible chunk of Jesus ' chest is torn away by a clawed cat-o-nine tails to reveal his ribs underneath . By the end of the movie Jesus is virtually half a skeleton with most of his body tissue removed and bone chipped away . It is the first time many of us have seen these images outside of a `` Slayer '' album cover and Gibson has turned the tables on what we could conventionally conceive in our minds as the murder of Christ . Nowhere in cinema has this subject be treated with the absolutely truthfulness and respect that it deserved . The actual term for these proceedings ( the last twelve hours of Christ ) is called - `` Deicide '' ( The act of killing a being of a divine nature ; particularly , the putting to death of Jesus Christ ) . The Passion of the Christ in wholly and indisputably a hell of a cinematic challenge for a rendition of `` Decide '' as it has never been seen before . You will not be able to tear your eyes away from the screen . When you come out of the cinema it is probably best if you take a lie down somewhere and contemplate what you have just witnessed . You have NEVER seen anything like this before ... nor will you want to again.The Passion of the Christ does not go into much detail about the life of Jesus or anything much biblical . In fact it is more akin to watching `` No Comment '' on Euro News ( basically news reports with just video images ) and letting you make up your own mind . For those of you who are not informed about what the life of Jesus was before he was crucified then you would do well to watch some early Hollywood production of the man 's life ( even though The Passion of the Christ is NOTHING like anything Hollywood has put out before ) . Jesus does say the odd line now and again but mostly this is a story about physical and mental suffering and there is no shortage of that as the film descends into depths that cinema has not treaded on before and where angles would fear to go . The film starts in the Garden of Olives following the Last Supper and Jesus ' encounter with Satan ( the only flaw in the film was Gibson 's overuse of these pantomime type evil characters and their satanic servants , rendered needlessly in CGI and do not really fit this picture that much in the same way that Jar Jar Binks did fit well with Star Wars Episode1. ) . Judas Iscariot cuts a deal with the Pharisees , who then pick Jesus up , torture him and humiliate him , before sending Jesus to a Roman trial to face charges of blasphemy . There are many moments of absolute unflinching horror throughout the ordeal even before the first whip is unleashed , however these are cleanly swept aside by the little miracles that occur along the way but it would only spoil it for you to tell you what these are ( a scene involving the cross being turned over is one of the most startling shots ever committed to celluloid and is sure to raise a few hairs ) . These little miracle moments are extremely powerful and are captured wonderfully by the glorious cinematography ( The Passion of the Christ looks simply divine ) .All in all it is hard to call this film a movie or an art-film . It is more akin to an ` out of control ' dramatic crime scene recreation that we see on true life law enforcement television programs , but here it is all uncut and does not shy away from exposing us to unrestrained , raw and unlimited amounts of human hatred and aggression . Forget the whole `` Anti-Semitic '' lark that the media went on about . The film clearly explains that Jesus , the son of God , was God , and chose his own fate . The fact that Jews or Roman 's where involved is only incidental to them being there . They are the same as anyone else who could not see with open eyes ! In fact under all the blood , bruises , bone and bumps Gibson manages to leave Christ 's right eye intact . He highlights this eye at times with a subtle illumination that carries an ` all seeing ' message with it and is another strong imagery device that is used in this production . It is the little things like this that make the film ingenious in a ` clever ' Spielberg sort of way . However when all is said and done Martin Scorsese ' The Last Temptation of Christ can still hold its own against this offering , however this one is certainly eons more disturbing.This is not a film you will enjoy but you will be damn glad that you went to see it and certainly since the original Matrix there has not been a good soul shaker doing the rounds in a long time . Thank God for Gibson ! This is Hollywood doing what it should be doing . More like this please !	1
I 'm sick of hearing every Tom , Dick and Harriet selfishly using this film as a staging area for attacks on the social ills of their choice . People come up with the most ridiculous bones to pick with this movie ; it 's `` porno violence '' , it 's sexist because Satan is portrayed as a woman ( actually much more of an androgynous figure , so ignore this moronic quibble when you see it ) , it 's `` unfocused '' . The real problem for many of these critics is that it 's a blockbuster movie about Jesus Christ and that 's just not a valid subject for serious `` cinema '' . Anti Semitic ? Absolutely not ; if anything the film portrays Judas and Peter as the biggest jerks in the story , and people are n't so stupid as to become racists and bigots from viewing a Hollywood picture , thank you very much . Overly violent ? It 's a film about THE LAST TWELVE HOURS OF CHRIST 'S LIFE ! What do you think you 're going to get ? If graphic violence is `` gritty '' , `` hip '' or `` brilliant '' in a Tarantino movie it 's just as valid here for my money . Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for his guts and vision in putting his own money where his mouth is in order to maintain the artistic integrity of his project . This is n't `` Bad Boys '' , `` Charlie 's Angels '' or `` Dirty Dancing '' here folks , and we should be grateful that there is a filmmaker in Hollywood who still produces work of this caliber.Okay , now that I 've vented , the acting is top notch , from the brilliant Jim Caviezel through the sadistic Roman soldiers , the photography is lush , the score is great , and it passes the real litmus test : you absolutely will not find your thoughts drifting to your grocery shopping , laundry , annoying co-workers , or anything else while viewing this film . Bravo . Here 's hoping Gibson films a prequel .	1
Nowhere else is the word 'hero ' defined better than what our Lord Jesus Christ did for us . He knew no sin and led the perfect life . He dedicated his life to serving God the Father and mankind by God 's will . He was and is perfect.But we can never be . Never again , will another walk upon the earth who is sinless , blameless and perfect as Jesus is . Jesus Christ , God 's one and only beloved son , given as a sacrifice to redeem mankind and save us from ourselves . God 's ultimate love offering given because He loves us so . Jesus came for exactly this , that we may be saved , have a new life more abundant here and eternal life with Him in God 's kingdom . Yes , he taught us and lived as the living example of what we all should aspire to be , but also to do what none of us could not do for ourselves . Pay the debt for our sins.Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that gives us the most accurate recreation of the Lord 's passion and suffering that has ever been seen . Combining the descriptions in the New Testament 's gospels along with the Old Testament 's prophecies of the Lord and the historical depictions of Roman punishment and torture devices , we 're able to see what the Lord most likely really endured . No question , this film is brutal , but it must be . If not , we only take away the truth in order to make ourselves feel more comfortable . I 've seen many a violent film in my time but I found myself cringing more here than any of those . Not because I 've never seen worse but because this is what the Savior did for us . It should 've been us taking the beatings , the floggings and the crucifixion . That was our punishment placed upon the holy and innocent Son of God . 'The Passion ' focuses on the last days of Jesus ' life here on earth . From the opening , we find him on the Mount of Olives , as the sins of the world are being placed upon him . As the cold , hard reality of the pain and suffering that he is about to endure for a people by large that reject him . But his love and dedication to The Father being so great , he remains committed and fulfills his purpose . He allows himself to be unjustly arrested and convicted of a crime he did not commit . Then handed over to the Romans to be scourged , tortured and ultimately put to death for the love of The Father and every one of us who 's sins he bore . As it is written , `` greater love has no man that he who lay down his life for his friends '' .But all of this would be in vain and just be a sad story had he not risen from the grave . If He were He just a man with some crazy ideas . But He did rise and is Lord and friend to all His people , to all God 's children , while extending His invitation to all those who would receive Him . But contrary to popular belief , we are not all God 's children . We are all God 's creations but not until we are born again by grace through faith , confession and repentance in the Lord Jesus Christ , are we God 's children . Jesus said , `` unless we are born again , we can not see the kingdom of God '' , and `` I am the way , the truth and the life , no one comes to the Father but by me '' . And so it is . Our sins must be dealt with . And so they were , on the shoulders of the Lord when he died on the cross , shedding his precious blood for us.This movie brought people to question , who 's to blame ? Is it the Jews fault , or the Romans , or all of us ? In a way , all three are true . We are all responsible . He paid the price for our sins , our debt . We all had a hand in it . But it was also the greatest demonstration of love ever shown . The Father 's great love and the love of the Lord.Some complain that the film is too focused on the suffering and does n't show the events leading up to this point , the miracles and the relationships . I understand that but theres only so much time to do it . There is a scene though , in a flashback , where Jesus is building a table and you see a playful sweetness between him and his mother Mary . It 's touching and I wanted to see more of that but there are other films that give us more of His life . I recommend 'Jesus of Nazareth ' in what I believe is the most compelling and accurate telling . But this film had to stay focused . It too had a mission and purpose . To bring us to face what God the Father and the Jesus Christ did for us . So we could face the reality of it and of ourselves and I believe it succeeds . Many peoples lives were changed with this movie . Many people came to believe and we 're saved . Many saved had fallen away and recommitted their lives to the Lord . Others were inspired to reflect and give thanks for the wonderful gift given to us . I know I did . I loved the fact that it got people talking . It got people thinking and discussing . It was on the T.V . and in the papers . People who would never otherwise talk about Jesus were and many who would never go to see such a film did . It was a wonderful time and a credit to the film.The dvd gives us a lovely period looking picture . Lots of browns and muted colors to show the age and make it believable . The print is clean and virtually free of blemish . The audio and score are very good . The dialog is in ancient hebrew with subtitiles which gives it a serious realism and is n't distracting . A very satisfying disc.In closing , 'The Passion ' is a wonderful film . It 's an undenialble message that will force the viewer to take a stand on what they believe or do n't believe . There is no middle ground . And that 's a huge accomplishment for a film , to do what it did . Mel Gibson has become a very accomplished director and it all shows here . Many criticize him even to this day for comments he made while intoxicated . People have used it as a chance to bash him and this movie . But as Jesus said , `` let he who is without sin , cast the first stone '' . We 've all said and done things that were n't right and have no right to rake another over the coals for it . He 's human after all , just like the rest of us and just as we wish to be forgiven for our own sins , we should forgive him . He made a wonderful film that I suggest anyone and everyone watch with the exception of small children as there is alot of blood and violence that 'll no doubt be scary to them . Parents , please use discretion and view it first . Jesus offers his invitation for salvation to everyone from all cultures and beliefs . All are welcome and no one will be turned away . Please consider accepting while you can .	1
Despite the criticism about Gibson 's biases , I found this film to be very moving and biblically sound . I 've never subscribed to blaming all of Jewish descent for Christ 's death . The true culprits were the elitist Jewish rulers who were threatened by Jesus ' message . Even today , we can see how quickly a crowd can be swayed to do horrible things . The acting and direction are wonderful .	1
Although the film is recut it still has a running time of 126 minutes .	1
I 'm not going to sit here and give you a review about my personal feelings of the film because my rating speaks for itself , but I will tell you what the truth is . Gibson , put his heart into making a detailed and accurate to the scriptures film . If you ca n't handle blood , do n't go see this movie , as a matter of fact if you ca n't handle the truth , do n't go see any historical movie or story that is going to try being as accurate as possible because the fact is life is pain and suffering and many great people have died horrible deaths for their beliefs and kindness . Ghandi was shot in cold blood just for preaching non violence , Joan of Ark was burned at the stake because of what she said and believed ( not a pretty site ! ) , Hitler massacred the Jews and believe me , that footage will haunt you , The Inquisition , Catholics burning and drowning women accused of witch craft , the massacre of millions of Native Americans , did you see AMISTAD ? Throwing black slaves of a ship chained to each other to drown to death ! ( And a lot more movies about blacks ! ! ) I finish a course in ancient History and the battles were bloody , the executions were horrible and the way people were treated is no easy task to depict in a film ; so spare people the time of writing negative reviews because the film is bloody or it was n't 7 hours long because you wanted to see other things and just be straight forward about it ! There are plenty of over bloody battles and tortures in films ( historians can mostly guess how much blood was shed in these situations ) We probably will never know exactly how much or little blood did Jesus shed in his crucifixion .If people truly believe this film is to bloody , they have not watched many films or do n't know much about the scriptures and history . We have all been cruel at some point in history and this film should be viewed positively . Jesus was tortured and killed for nothing but kindness , if you could n't see that in this movie , then no one can help you . A story should be told to the fullest detail no mater how hard or graphic it might be and maybe we can learn something from reality and not bull ( like fake thanksgiving movies ! ) All filmmakers deserve their creative views towards making a movie . There will be others who will try to tell this story , and we will get a chance to see other versions . Thumbs up ! Great job Mel Gibson	1
After hearing how so many folks in the evangelical Christian community have approved of this film , I went in with a great hope that I would experience some sort of epiphany ; a renewal of the mind , in which I 'd see things clearer about the hope of Christ in my otherwise tired life . So I took half a day off , the only way I can see an honest-to-goodness movie any more in this regimented life , and took my seat . It surely smacked of authenticity , as we see in the most compelling of ways how the King of the Jews was smacked around by the kind of sadistic folks that hold power in a dreary Roman backwater . In the more comical words of Will Smith as Jim West ( `` Wild , Wild West '' ) , `` now THAT was a whuppin ' '' .But the initial question posed by satan , which ran along the lines of `` how can one man 's death remove the sins of all mankind ? `` , remained without much of an improvement on the answer . I suppose I should have brought a little more faith with me to the theater . If you 're into Scripture and like the infallibility of the Bible , well , this is a good one . The script is faithful to the Gospels , through and through . I was thinking that what we have here is the vision of canonical Christianity for 2004 , just as we saw for 1959 with `` Ben Hur '' . But while a movie like this is fine raw material for the inspired , who have a better map of just where the pieces fit in the implied majesty of the makers of initial premise , it is not as directed to the wandering ones who are after a compelling reason for holding such premises in the first place . The choir needs the sermon , yes , but even more so the backsliders and the non-contrite.I do n't know why I 'm so down on such a fine and time-tested story . It could well be the cynicism of this day , in which faith is not so readily accepted at face value . I suspect that were I in a true state of grace , I 'd be putting down the five stars . This must not be the year for that kind of stuff.I did sit in one sitting through the entire 126 minutes , for the pugilism of Roman and Jew alike , with every variety of contemporary weapon formed in those days , was sensational in itself . The character best portrayed is that of Pilate , who realizes he has a real problem on his hands . There are so many flashbacks to the high points of Christ 's ministry , such as the Sermon on the Mount , the stoning of the adultress , the Last Supper , etc. , only what we end up with is a crucified King . Are we simply being told to turn our other cheeks , the way `` Yeshua '' turns just about every part of his body to the scourgings ? If I was supposed to have a personal experience of Jesus Christ as my Personal Savior through this film , well , I 'll stick with the ones I had as a much younger man . The emphasis of the progressive ministry is , after all , a call for direct dialogue and personal experience , rather than being shown in imagery an interpretation that purports to be authentic . I suppose I 'm seeing in a mirror what might one day be seen clearly , to borrow from Paul.Were we not so entirely inculcated in Western culture with the Passion narrative , I 'm not thinking this would be such a compelling drama . Some upstart of the countryside has a cult following , he 's picked up as a security threat to the government , and is beaten to a pulp , prior to his execution . It would be better with an international terrorist conspiracy , perhaps , one that fights with automatic weapons and grenade launchers . It seems strange , that the the leader of the good guys should get such treatment.To the film 's credit in advocating the love of those that torment you , I found that I was better able to tolerate the horrendous city traffic getting home , when this was done . Still , during that same interval , I turned on the CD in the truck of Webber & Rice 's `` Jesus Christ Superstar '' and felt a good bit more in the 60 's version of the way it was , on that day , when he took my sins away.The crucifixion , indeed , is a riddle . `` To conquer death you only have to die '' ( J.C.S. , `` Poor Jerusalem '' ) ? Is that something like a Zen koan ?	1
this is such a wonderful story to be shared and told over and over . great movie , well done , great purchase	1
I have owned this DVD of The Passion of the Christ for over a year but I did n't sit down and see it for the first time until this Good Friday . I delayed watching this movie all that time because I listened and read many people 's descriptions of the brutal violence , which I allowed to sway me against it for a long time . But now that I 've finally seen it , I 'm very glad I did . The film is excellent , the acting across the board is superb - Jim Caviezel 's incredible portrayal of Jesus will forever be the definitive cinema Christ for me , the cinematography is also first rate , and the music is beautiful to listen to . The violence is tough to watch but it is not gratuitous . Jesus according to the Gospels did endure horrific brutality and Roman crucifixion was designed by the state to be a savage deterrent . Two scenes that stick with me are the playful loving tenderness between Jesus and Mary when Mary calls Jesus inside for mealtime while he is busy building a table , and the other is Simon of Cyrene screaming at the people and soldiers to stop beating Jesus as he was lying on the ground , then whispering to Jesus that they are almost there as he helped him carry his cross to Golgotha . That was a very powerful and moving scene , among many throughout the film . Whatever anyone thinks of Mel Gibson as a person , he used his talent and considerable skill to create what has turned out to be one of the most important films ever made in cinema history . It will become an annual tradition for many to see it during Good Friday and Easter and will continue to have lasting influence and benefits in people 's lives for a long time to come .	1
Considering the appalling amounts of cinematic slop which Hollywood has splashed across the silver screen for so many years , I have often wondered if anyone in the motion picture industry was capable of producing a film masterpiece which was uplifting to its viewers ( let alone willinig to do so ) . Mel Gibson stepped up and delivered such a film in 2004 with `` The Passion of the Christ . '' `` Jesus of Nazareth '' remains my favorite film about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ . `` The Passion of the Christ '' is not about the LIFE and MINISTRY of Jesus , but about His death and the twelve hours leading up to His crucifixion . The story of a God who loved all mankind so much that He sent His only Son to die for our sins so we could be with Him for all eternity is indeed the `` greatest story ever told . '' Gibson , drawing from the four gospels of the New Testament , has given us a faithful , lovingly crafted rendering of that story . James Caviezel gives one of the greatest performance of any `` screen Jesus '' I 've ever seen ( second only , perhaps , to Robert Powell in `` Jesus of Nazareth '' ) . Yes , this film is very bloody , and is probably not suitable for children under thirteen . Yet many of the same media buffoons who have attacked `` The Passion '' for its violence have defended many other movies which are also very violent , but not nearly as uplifting as `` The Passion . '' Now , nearly three years after the releaseof the original theatrical cut of the film , Fox is finally releasing the DVD set I 've been waiting for -- complete with both the original and `` edited '' versions of the movie , plus bonus features including featurettes and several commentary tracks -- far superior to the `` vanilla DVD '' release of `` The Passion '' from late 2004 . I hope that `` The Passion of the Christ '' will unstill in many people a passion FOR the Christ .	1
Recently I read a review of The Passion of the Christ which aside from calling it anti-Semitic and showing porno-violence , it made the assertion that Mel Gibson missed the opportunity to demonstrate that it was everyman who murdered Christ . The review claimed that by making Annas and Caiaphas , the Jewish high priests , look so evil that we do not see ourselves as crucifying Christ , but cast the blame for Jesus death on those evil Jewish priest , hence by implication , the Jewish people as a whole.Annas and Caiaphas were filthy rich , belonging to the sect of the Sadducees that rejected the work of the supernatural and were in collusion with Rome . These men were just about as corrupt and evil as anyone could be . Try as one might , few of us have anything in common with these them . Annas and Caiaphas were evil , corrupt men . That is not to say they were devoid of any good , but it is obvious from the gospel accounts that these men sought the preservation of their own wealth and position above that of seeking justice . On the other hand , we see members of the Jewish Senate who saw this execution as a travesty of justice , we see the Jewish father who helped Jesus carry his cross , and the Jewish women who wailed for Jesus death . We see the Romans who beat Jesus , humiliated him and nailed him to the cross . Life is rarely as simply as good guy- bad guy- bad people are capable of doing good things , and good people are capable of doing evil things.Gibson hit the nail right on the head . Aside from being a fairly accurate account of the gospel story , Gibson did show that everyman was responsible for Christ 's death . From the Roman governor to the Roman soldier , from the Jewish leaders , to the Jewish rabble , from rich person to poor person , from Jew to Gentile- all bear responsibility . Anti-Semitic ? No way . Oh , by the way , where are these liberal critics when it comes to denouncing anti-Semitism in socialist Western Europe or in the Moslem mosques who daily cry for the extermination of the Jewish people ? Porno-violence ? Give me a break . Since when has any liberal decried either pornography or violence when to supports liberal causes ? I think Gibson hit the nail right on the head .	1
Mel Gibson 's Passion Of The Christ , released on Ash Wednesday , has made millions of dollars , and will perhaps be recognized for some Academy Award or other in next year 's Oscars . It is his first director 's debut and entirely his film . It has Mel Gibson written all over it . It is a violent film from a master of violent cinema . Mel Gibson , much like Arnold Schwartznegger , is primarily an action star and caters only to male audiences that are fond of blood and guts . He has an obscession and disturbing taste for films dealing with a theatre of blood , intense suffering , and it is disguised as historical films or colorful backdrops of far-off lands- Braveheart and the earlier Mad Max films confirm this and the spiritual elements and Jesus Christ 's messsage of universal love and peace are not expressed in this film . Instead we have yet another Mel Gibson hero being sadistically tortured and nailed on a cross . Mel knew he had a big audience in Christians because they have a large media he could market the film to . Also , despite the accuracy of using Hebrew , Aramaic and Latin , Gibson casts yet again a Caucasian actor in the role of Jesus . Jesus was not white . He was a Jew with Semitic physical features- dark hair , dark eyes , tan or dark skin . And he could not have been that strong or powerfully-built because he was mosly a man of peace in the style of Ghandi and his body deteriorated after the intense Crucifixion . That 's all that Gibson showcases- the violent and bloody destruction of Jesus ' body but he does n't even emphasize the soul , the spirit and the transformation that Jesus had in the Ressurection.Where is the real message of the Gospels ? Where is the Glorious Resurrection ? I 'm sorry Mr. Gibson . Even as a Christian I ca n't watch this film . It 's not done tastefully and it 's an insult to the Gospels . It is soo shocking and graphic that an old lady from Kansas died of a heart attack watching this movie . The movie is merely Mel Gibson 's attempt to redeem himself as a lapsed Catholic ( he admitted in interviews that he was addicted to alcohol and that he attempted suicide until he married and had kids and returned to his Catholic religion of his youth ) . It 's a good thing that he 's a born-again Catholic and that he is trying to be more spiritual , but he is not doing that with this fim . What it all comes down to is making money . That ' Hollywood . It 's as money-making factory . Mel Gibson may defend his film all he wants and convince himself that it was inspired by God but it 's not true . God would not approve of this film . I 'm sure he does n't even want to be reminded of the terrible ordeal his Son went through . Why open up old wounds ? Instead of watching this nightmare , why do n't you read the Bible instead or watch movies that have portrayed the Passion Of The Christ with more class . Ben-Hur with Charleton Heston has a fine Passion sequence towards the end of the film and so does The Greatest Story Ever Told .	1
Let 's step back , put aside the religious debate for a second , and acknowledge that `` Passion of the Christ '' is a milestone in mainstream cinema.I sat down with `` Passion '' ready to sneer , laugh , and belittle . Granted , when the credits rolled I was laughing , but not for the reason you think.Think about it ! What director and actor Mel Gibson ( `` Braveheart '' ) has done is nothing short of mesmerizing and laudable : he has pulled together what amounts to a TWO HOUR snuff film involving no less than Jesus Christ , the Son of God , the Mystery made Flesh , the King of Kings , Emmanuel , meaning `` God is with Us '' .Think about that for a second . I 'll be here when you get back . Seriously , it takes wee kegs of steel to make a snuff film with JC.Awright , for those who do n't know , `` Passion '' is all about the final 12 hours of JC , referred to as the `` Stations of the Cross '' by Catholics : we follow Jesus from Gethsemane , where he 's praying ( wait ... he 's God ... who is he praying to ? I 'm confused ... nah , never mind ) all the way to Golgotha , and on the way JC does a whole heap of dying.I 'm not kidding . That 's what the film is about . Now , I know a ton of Christians -- -including Mel -- -who will argue until they 're blue in the face that this is about Christ 's suffering , and what He did for us . And yeah , for sure , it 's about his suffering , alright . But that does n't quite grasp the nature of the beast , if you 'll allow me the license.It 's not about the message of Christ . It 's not about belief . It 's not about miracles , or God , or mercy -- -it 's about a 1st century AD Jew being folded , spindled , and mutilated by the Romans and their Jewish subjects -- -and when they get done folding , spindling , and mutiliating him , mind ya , they 're just getting going.You 've got beating , gouging , flaying alive , flesh ripping , spear-thrusting , thorn of crowns head ripping ! And to top it off , when the blood ca n't run any thicker or redder , the Romans get bored and nail JC to the cross . Sissies.Now , I 'm an action guy , so this is where `` Passion '' lost a star . I got tired of the sissy Romans and Pharisees picking on Jesus . After a while , you think -- -if there is a God , a *just* God , he would give his Son full permission to jump down off the Cross and do a little `` Raiders of the Last Arc '' number on his executioners . But no , does n't happen , no spoiler here -- -we do n't get a happy ending ; JC believed in peace , which is why I ai n't a Christian.What we *do* get , though , is gore . Oh , and gorgeous cinematography by Caleb Deschanel ( who did the camera-work for `` Being There '' and `` The Patriot '' , among many other flicks ) , solid acting by all the players ( James Caviezel as JC made me actually *want* to believe ) , including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene , the whore . That was a stretch for her , I 'm sure . Oh , and we get Latin and Aramaic as the *only* languages available ( do n't worry morons , subtitles ) . Sweet.In the end , twisted , unwashed , heathen , stinking unbeliever that I am , I sorta enjoyed `` Passion of the Christ '' . I 'm big into gore : I love splatter , love the sicko films of H.G . Lewis , love the Japanese gore `` Guinea Pig '' flicks , you name it . Basically , this was a snuff/gore/splatter flick with the Son of God as its subject , which , again -- -well , that 's pretty ballsy , Mr. Gibson ! We do n't get the Resurrection ( think of the Special Effects on that one , baby ! ) . We do n't get any sex scenes , which at least Martin Scorcese threw into his JC film . We also do n't get any cool battle scenes , but I guess that 's to be expected ( someone -- -Ah-nold , mebbe ? or Stallone ? -- -should have shown up to rescue Jesus ) . Anyway , this film is like life : raw , brutal , nasty , pathetic , ultimately pointless . But it 's still worth checking out , cochise , if only to see how a true Man ( JC ) faces death . You 'd whine and cry like a baby . He did n't . Street creds , man.It also helped that I saw `` Passion '' as a double feature with `` Dawn of the Dead '' ( 2004 remake ) . Seeing the one after the other made it seem like , you know , a sequel . We did n't get the Resurrection , but Christ *does* rise from the Dead , and so by the time 2004 rolled around , everyone was infected . In that light , JC was the O.Z . ( Original Zombie ) .Peace out , dawgz .	1
Amazon.com 's `` star '' rating system makes rating Mel Gibson 's `` The Passion of the Christ '' difficult . Five stars , the top ranking , transaltes to `` I Love It ! '' It 's hard to believe that anyone can watch this movie and have an `` I Love It ! '' reaction . Having just viewed the movie for the first time , I can attest that Gibson and team have made an amazing , top-notch film , but it 's also a movie that I do n't want to see again for quite some time . `` The Passion , '' appropriately titled , focuses primarily on Jesus ' ( played with phenomenal range and conviction by Jim Caviezel ) last 12 hours of life -- from the betrayal of Judas to his death on the cross . Completely abandoning the sugary-sweet pablum of so many `` traditional '' religious movies , `` The Passion '' shows its characters as real-world men and women living in a hard-scrabble real world . . . raggedy beards , threadbare clothes , poverty , and none of the benign halos of self-knowing holiness that plague other depictions of Christ . We get some flashbacks to isolated scenes , such as the Last Supper , some of Jesus ' lectures , and poignant shots of Jesus as a child and also working as a carpenter . But these incidents are short interventions in an otherwise streamlined narrative.Jesus ' betrayal by Judas is followed by aspects of Jesus ' story that are largely unknown to Christians who attend church only at Christmas and Easter . A `` trial '' by Jewish elders is followed by handing Jesus over to the Romans , who punt Jesus back to Herod for judgment ( Pontius Pilate being savvy enough to avoid this hot potato ) . But Jesus ends up back before Pilate and the elders demand the death of Jesus , whom they see as a dangerous rabble-rouser who is undermining centuries of holy teaching.The movie then turns to its most notorious aspects -- the torture and execution of Jesus . While the gore is unrelenting , this is not mindlessly handled by Gibson and his team . The extent of Jesus ' suffering for mankind is the precise point of the story , and it is impossible to watch this movie and not be affected . This is a movie that brings Jesus ' sacrifice home in the most powerful of ways -- by showing in graphic fashion how much the man endured and still managed to ask for man 's forgiveness , `` for they know not what they do . `` This is a movie of powerful performances and visual artistry . . . for all its horrors , `` The Passion '' is a beautiful film . The soundtrack is also understated , yet important - the few times I noticed it , I was moved . And the special effects are perhaps too good - the violence unleashed on Jesus ' body never looks cartoonish or unrealistic.I 'll leave it to others to debate the charges of anti-semitism that arise from `` The Passion . '' As a relatively uninformed observer , the movie appears balanced to me -- most of the Jewish elders demand Jesus ' death ( although there are a couple of elders who question this , but they are shouted down ) , but there are plenty of other Jews in the movie who decry what they see -- the problem is that they are outside the local power structure . All in all , it does n't come across as an anti-semitic movie unless one starts with the proposition that the movie tells an anti-semitic story.Few movies qualify as `` important '' in my book , but this one is right up there with Spielberg 's two WWII movies , `` Saving Private Ryan '' and `` Schindler 's List , '' as well as other flicks like `` The Accused , '' `` Platoon , '' `` Mississippi Burning , '' and `` Ghandi . '' These movies generally are n't easy to watch , but they tell stories that I should know better , and they tell the story so well that it is seared into my brain . `` The Passion '' is an unforgettable masterpiece -- it may be a couple of years before I feel the need to watch it again , but I 'm sure that I 'll remember every scene.A must-see .	1
I find it sad that reviewers such as `` A Kid 's Review '' ( only one of quite a few ) found it necessary to use personal attacks as a way of conveying their lack of spiritual understanding of or enthusiasm for the film . ( Saying over and over again that they wish Mel had made another Mad Max film only shows they did not have the ability or desire to consider what the film was about . You probably should not have seen it since you are clearly unable to grasp the truth of His message . ) That said , I will not lower myself again to the same level as other reviewers who attack differing personal spiritual views as a means to criticize the film - I can only suppose it is because they are threatened by the message . If you did n't like the film , say why you did n't like the film . Do n't call people who DID find the film a profoundly moving experience idiots because you ca n't understand our faith . It is only demonstrating your own ignorance to do so . If you choose not to believe that Jesus was who he was portrayed as in `` The Passion of the Christ '' and in the Bible , that is your opinion and you are welcome to it . But save the intellectual drivel about how anyone who does believe is deluded and can not think for themselves . Learn to read and research and you might be surprised at what you learn . And - By the way - I am a Christian ( NOT Catholic ) who was brought up Unitarian . I know how to read and think for myself ! I 'm not being blindly lead . Free will is a basic point of Faith . I use my free will to believe . You use yours to ridicule . I 'm sad for you.In terms of visual message , this film was spectacular . The cinematography is amazing . It truly conveys the anguish most involved experienced - not just Jesus and his followers . For those who claim that His message is missed in the film , I call your attention to the last moments on the Cross when the other men there had the chance to choose their path - the redemption one received while the other continued to ridicule . That is the bottom line message - the redemption and forgiveness that is available to all.I have seen many reviews that criticize Mel for making it too violent . I find this ironic . Have you watched the violence out there on film , in video games , even on TV ? I certainly have plenty of it in my film library . Our culture has become immune to it . I expect that had the violence not been portrayed so graphically the film would have lost substantial impact . That said , it was the most difficult film I have ever watched and I cried throughout the film in the theater , but I purchased the DVD . I will watch it again when I feel I need to be reminded of the sacrifice that was made on the behalf of all who believe - and all who do not .	1
Timeless , memorable epic on the final moments of the historical Jesus of Nazareth who was called the Christ ( `` the anointed one '' ) . Opening scene starts off with Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane at the Mount of Olives , and ends with him walking out of his tomb . No spoilers here about everything else in between.If you 're a visual person , watch this movie and appreciate its artistic message , as gruesome as it is portrayed . Flashback technique is used very well . For me , watching this DVD once is enough . I ca n't stand the sight of all the blood and gore , but know that to be true to reality as the Director would have it to be . Jesus was n't whipped with just a few strokes as revisionists would like to imagine it to be . If you yet do n't understand how Jesus suffered and died , this is THE film to watch . If you want to live in a fantasy world where Jesus ' death was a painless one ( no one talks about it these days ! ) , whitewashed through quick verablizations at Sunday school at some vague notion of `` death '' , then this film will shock and terrify you into numbness . This is not recommended for feeble minded kids.If you know little or nothing about Jesus except hearsay , start by reading the Bible first , specifically all the 4 Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament . Next , read `` The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ '' by visionary Anne Catherine Emmmerich . Director Mel Gibson used this book as a reference to his movie . Once you 're done reading the entire , watch this Mel Gibson movie . Things could be clearer to you then . Stop succumbing to sloth and go read the above first.Jesus ' miracles , life , suffering and death would only make sense if viewed in a strictly religious and/or deep Christian spiritual sense . Without understanding these first , I do n't know how else you can see Him . How you will react or perceive this movie depends on how much you know about Jesus , or how much you believe or know Jesus , to begin with . This Passion movie does n't dilute the truth of Jesus and tells it like it is . If not for his false accusers , Jesus may not have died the way that he did . These false accusers happen to be his fellow Jews and other power-hungry politicians of his day . Strangely , most people would prefer to believe in lies elsewhere and can not appreciate the social , religious , or spiritual tones to Jesus ' Person , and his life and death . No one likes to talk about death and the cross these days , but Mel Gibson shows it like it is . Kudos to Director Mel Gibson and this graphic film about the final moments of Jesus ' life on earth ! If you 're Christian , whatever your denomination , perhaps this film could make you appreciate what it means when the Church and Bible say that `` Jesus died for our sins '' . Of course , this has to read in the context of the cosmology/theology of salvation history.If I had walked with Jesus before he entered Jerusalem and knew of the spiritual significance of his mission , I might tell him not to sacrifice his precious life for this putrid human race ! Remember that until today , 5/6 of the world still refuses to understand Jesus . In my opinion , He has wasted His Precious Blood on ingrates ! This DVD contains : - subtitles in English/Spanish- commentaryRecommended reading : The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ	1
Even after more than 6 months since I last saw the film at the theater , this film is still something that I can not get over . If you purchase only one DVD this year , make this the one ! Now that all the controversy has died down you can watch this film and truly enjoy Mel Gibsons film making abilities . His `` in your face '' style may have turned off some people , but I found it refreshing . How could you not focus on the suffering of Christ ? How could you not show the violence he suffered through during his last 24 hours on this earth ? The violence is there to show his compassion for us , his utter love and ultimate sacrifce for us , even those who do not believe . The violence was there for a reason . I find it ironic that those who condemned the violence the most are those who consider films like Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction to be works of genius.The acting is top notch . James Caviezel must be nominated for Best Actor , as he turns in a performance second to none ( and in a dead language at that ! ) . His portrayal of Jesus Christ was by far the best I 've ever seen . If he is n't nominated I will forever be sure he was robbed.But the great acting does n't stop here . Maia Morgensterns portrayel of Mary was superb and often brought me to tears . She shows the love Mary had for her son and the connection between the two actors is amazing . She often portrays emotion with her eyes , something I find many actors can not do , even the `` best '' .However , my favorite performance after James ' was Histo Shopov as Pontius Pilate . Wow . This guy is amazing ! Where did Mel find him ? I do n't know , but he should be in MANY more roles and I hope both he and Maia start appearing in films here in the US much more often . His portrayal of Pilate was chilling and brought some humanity to this figure , which is difficult to do.Cinematography ? Beautiful . Absolutely beautiful . The imagery and photography are just amazing . I ca n't say anymore than Bravo ! Buy this film . NOw ! ! ! !	1
This film shows us what our Lord and Saviour did for ALL of us in this world.The movie is EXTREMLY violent and graphic , but it is made that way for a reason.This would be a great film to show to an unsaved friend or family member to show them why Jesus went through all that pain and agony . ... .so we would n't have to ( John 3:16 )	1
This film portrays the very graphic and disturbing final 12 hours of the life of Jesus as authenticaly as possible primarily following the gospels of Mathew , Mark , luke and John . Minimal subtitles fill in what might not be infered through the visual story telling . The dialog is in Aramic and latin . There are a few flashbacks that give a sense of personal investment for the viewer of the the man being horribly ravaged by the Roman 's who heartlessly beat and physicaly torture the man repeatedly for the bulk of the film . Given this last 12 hours concept little is revealed of the miraculous or divine nature of the Christ as the title assures him to be . We do see a passionate and strong spritual being in the garden being tempted by satan and are re-assured again of Jesus as divine at one other time . Other than that his divine nature could possibly be missed and we are given Jesus as man which was how he was to endure humanity 's wrath . The image 's are brutal and relentless . The satanic images are searing and frightening and the film does reference material from outside the gospel which keep the satanic imagery included throughout the film from what I have read . The point of this film seems to have been to leave an indelable mark on the collective conciousness of this generation and its should definately succeed . I was shaken by both the film and it 's success . The only thing missing was a better understanding of his message of love that was so incriminating at year 0 .	1
excellent movie with superb direction from mel gibson . this should of won an oscar for independent release . very realistic depiction of jesus .	1
I , a neo-feminist if there ever was one , award `` The Passion '' 5 stars as a showing of fearless faith on the part of Mr. Gibson . I hesitated in doing so , because simply this movie is just that ... a movie . I 'm a white woman , yet I can relate to people of most races ( I 've been called an `` honorary woman of color '' by several black and mixed friends ) . Despite all this , I am troubled by a white man ( Mr. James Caviezel ) portraying the greatest Man to walk the earth : Jesus Crhist . The backstory is well-known by now , Gibson was forced ( by the distributor ) into casting a white man to play Jesus . He should 've stood his ground , but I ca n't blame him for caving in . I 've been involved in show business for most of my life , and I realize that in smalltown U.S.A. , a white Jesus plays better in the multiplexes.But the movie is worthy , though exceedingly ( and unrealistically ) violent . I understand that Mr. Gibson was filled with passion while creating this masterwork , but even he should 've exercised some restraint . Also , the foreign-language soundtrack was a bit much . The DVD version should have offered a dubbed English track .	1
Having done my best to resist the hype and controversy regarding `` The Passion of the Christ , '' I finally had the chance to view it on DVD . It is a sturdy , beautifully-filmed version of a story that is eminently familiar to millions ; the new spin here is the level of verisimilitude offered in depicting the last brutal hours leading to Christ 's crucifixion . And that 's where the film is both brilliant and maddening.On the one hand , if its central message is that Jesus of Nazareth -- whether one believes him to have been the son of God or simply a charismatic , visionary upstart -- suffered a gruesome demise on behalf of his efforts , then showing suffering is absolutely critical to creating the proper catharsis about his sacrifice . To that end , I found myself in tears several times , as well as filled with moments of joy and hope before the film ended , something that at my age does n't happen from watching movies much anymore.On the other hand , I also wondered if everything I saw was truly necessary . Too many films today have a pornographic fixation on violence , and the slow-motion shots and efforts to simultaneously mollify and shock with visceral images often tread into fetishism . I found myself actually wondering while witnessing these moments if `` Bambi '' or `` Old Yeller '' were remade today , would we have 20-minute scenes of the demise of sympathetic characters not to illicit true emotions , but simply to appeal to some bloodthirsty part of ourselves that wants to see them . ( No , for those looking for an ax to grind , I 'm not comparing the life of Christ to children 's movies ; I 'm comparing the cinematic experience of creating deeply sympathetic characters that die to the notion of just how brutal their deaths must be to make us feel something profound . ) If there are obvious weaknesses to the film , they are mostly technical . Mel Gibson 's direction is quite controlled and inspired , but like most contemporary filmmakers , he over-relies on the closeup , giving the film , as a friend later suggested , a claustrophobic feel . John Debney 's soundtrack is moving , even if some elements remind me of James Horner 's `` Glory '' soundtrack . Most of the cast is good , if thug-like or wan , and Jim Caveziel 's Jesus , like Willem DaFoe 's in `` The Last Temptation of Christ , '' is sympathetic but lacks the full virtue , kindness and profundity I associate with Christ . In a word , he 's just too ordinary ( even if he 's made up to look a little more like a product of the Middle East rather than Western Europe ) .Lastly , I 've never understood how anyone can profess to love Jesus but still somehow have animus toward Jews -- it just boggles the mind . I do n't believe `` The Passion of the Christ '' reinforces negative stereotypes , though there clearly are villains and tormentors represented here , and I 'm sure some people will read into the characterizations what they will . I found things pretty even-handed , with both sympathetic and unsympathetic characters of the faiths and ethnicities that share the spotlight in this film .	1
Enough has been said to provide plenty of summaries , historical accuracy , religious prejudice and Mel Gibson 's personality faults and traits . I am only concerned with the quality of the transfer of this film 's audio and video from Standard Def to Blu Ray . Here goes.VIDEO ... .The transfer to Blu Ray is excellent . Film grain is not noticeable anywhere and details in the many dark or shadow areas are clearly discernible . Colors are rich and accurate with no false color grading that I could tell . Most of the lighting used in the film was shot with fairly warm tones and , even though this films takes place in the mid East , you do not get that golden , overly bright color grading that you see in many of the war and espionage films that take place in the middle East i.e . The Green Zone , Jarhead , The Kingdom and many others . At no time did I see any artifacting or aliasing throughout the film . The film is letterboxed with bars on top and bottom but that does n't bother me . Mbps rate tends to average in the lower to mid twenties.AUDIO ... On Blu Ray you get a lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 audio codec that , though I was reading the English subtitles , provided for clean and transparent sound . While there is some directional use of foley fx to the front sides , both the front and rear surrounds are primarily used for ambient crowd noise . However , they used them well and the audio was definitely immersive in many scenes . There are a great number of language subtitles to choose from and there is no English dubbing as Mr. Gibson had intended.EXTRAS ... While I did not own the Standard Def version , I had seen it a couple of times and it appeared pretty clean to me at the time . Thus , I do not think that this film was wholly remastered for Blu Ray but I do believe that they reformatted it from a very clean mother master . This is a 2 disc set , I watched the theatrical release . The other version is supposed to have been edited for kids to see without being exposed to the many scenes of extreme violence and torture . Other extras include 2 deleted scenes that come without any subtitles but I had no problem getting the gist of what the characters were saying . The other extras surely came on the Standard Definition release as they were all in a 4:3 aspect ration . These extras were interviews with Mel Gibson and cast regarding the writing , directing and acting within the film . Basically , it is one long extra that has been cut into several sub chapters regarding the film . One extra , which I did try , was a fact pop up which came on during the playing of the movie . I was expecting historical facts or opinions but the pop ups were either biblical quotations or facts about the lighting , sets , or studio where scenes were shot . Disappointed in that.All in all , while this is not a film I will watch frequently , the transfer to Blu Ray does deserve the 5 stars I gave it for its clean video and lossless audio.All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of a film 's transfer and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase as well as any number of my other reviews might.Thanks for reading .	1
Mel Gibson may be criticized a lot recently , but he got this movie right . Sometimes we forget just what a terrible thing a crucifixtion must have been and how Christ suffered .	1
This movie really helped to appreciate the saying & # 34 ; Jesus died for my sins & # 34 ; . I 'd heard that all my life but now I can better understand what that was like . Violent it is but flogging and crucifixion were not usually done gently .	1
Seldom does a large audience leave a movie theater in complete silence , but that is precisely what happened during the matinee showing of Gibson 's Passion that my wife and I attended . Many left the theater visibly shaken , others in tears . I have not seen any other film have quite the effect on an audience that this one did . My wife and I did not speak a word until we were in the car for at least five minutes.I have seen many of the other `` Passion '' stories , everything from Franco Zeffirelli 's `` Jesus of Nazareth '' to Andrew Lloyd Webber 's `` Jesus Christ Superstar , '' and while all of these have their individual merits , Gibson 's Passion succeeds where the others do n't always get it right . As viscerally wrenching as the film is , Gibson succeeds in capturing the key element that the others overlook : power.Gibson 's `` Passion Play '' could just as easily be called the `` Power Play , '' because when you reduce the story to its key thematic elements , the crucifixion and death of Christ are about the complex power structure that Jesus threatened . Jesus , the son of a carpenter , threatened the religious power of the Pharisees over the Jewish people . He threatened the power of Pilate to keep the Jewish population in line . Herod , when Jesus is brought before him , however , is short-sighted enough to believe that , because Jesus does not perform a miracle on demand for him , Jesus has no power over him . Herod , of course , further ridicules Jesus and sends him back to Pilate.The thematic element of power undergirds all others in the film , and could be summed up in one of the lines of dialogue ( roughly approximated here ) that is taken from the gospel of John . Before he is sentenced to crucifixion , Jesus says to Pilate : `` You have no power over me except what is given from above . '' Therein lies the reminder that , although the earthly powers that be have beaten Jesus to a bloody pulp , mocked him , tormented him , and killed him in perhaps the most painful way possible , they truly have no power over him.As for the pre-release charges of anti-semitism , I am unconvinced that the film is anti-semitic . If this film is anti-semitic , then so is the entire New Testament . Although Caiaphas and some of the high priests are ultimately depicted as forcing Pilate 's hand in crucifying Christ , there are notable dissenting voices among the high priests who feel that the charges against Christ are ridiculous . These high priests are quickly silenced and shoved out of the way by the high priest . I found the depictions of the Pharisees to be less favorable in Lloyd Webber 's musical than in this film , and with the passage of time , the controversies over `` Superstar '' have died down considerably . I expect that the same will occur with this film.More disturbing than the singular hatred Caiaphas and other members of the Pharisees display toward Jesus is the merry brutality of the Romans , the group that comes off most poorly in the film . The centurions who carry out the graphic and bloody scourging of Christ are not just following orders -- they visibly enjoy the torment they are inflicting . They believe they hold the ultimate power over Christ 's physical body , and beat and ridicule him mercilessly , baring their awful teeth in sneers of derision from the courtyard where Christ is scourged all the way to Golgotha . If anyone is to be reviled , it is the Roman centurions.Another theme that Gibson captures so well in the film is the battle raging between the larger powers of good and evil . A pale , androgynous creature that we can only assume to be Satan appears throughout the film , reminding us that although this drama is the passion of the Christian God incarnate in a man , there is much more at stake than the petty power play on earth -- the forces of good and evil have thrown down the gauntlet in Jerusalem.Gibson also acknowledges the fact that the crucifixion is n't the end of the story of Christ . Where Lloyd Webber 's musical stops at the cross , Gibson 's continues , albeit briefly , to the resurrection . Not that anyone can really give `` spoilers '' to one of the best-known plot lines of all time , but without giving too much away , let me just say that Gibson recognizes that the ultimate power play happens after the death of Jesus . Although he gives it somewhat short shrift in the closing moments of the film , we get a hint of the joy that is the Christian Easter holiday after getting hit with two hours of the brutal pain that is Good Friday in the Christian tradition.An ecumenical masterpiece , Gibson 's work will be remembered by Christians long after the petty controversies have died down as a graphic reminder of Christ 's suffering , death , and resurrection for the sins of the world . While the movie is certainly too intense for anyone younger than teenagers , it is a brutally accurate and moving experience for adults of any faith . The acting is magnificent , and the cinematography and score will move even the hardest of hearts . A must-see film for people of any faith who want to understand what the Christian faith is all about .	1
It amazes me to see how some people in this world can be so stubborn and ignorant that they put so much focus on looking for if Jews are being blamed for Jesus ' death and put less focus on what the ultimate goal was behind Jesus ' death ( one individual in particular is Jamie Bernard in NY Daily News , try to read her review online sometime . ) Coming out of this movie , my faith was more intensified by what was probably the most graphic and yet closely accurate depiction of Jesus ' last 12 hours on earth . But the real deal I want to get to is the fact that it was not Jews that put Jesus to the cross nor was it the Roman soldiers , it was humanity . Our sins and our disobedience to God is what did it . People can say that based on this interpretation , Jesus ' own people sentenced him to be crucified or that the Romans were made to be like drunk lunatics . But I see it as a showcase of how deep our sin , as one race , got and it needed someone of the stature of Jesus Christ to go through this torture and death to be purged of that . THAT 's what this was about . It was a message of sacrifice and a message of love , something that was even told well through flashbacks to the Passover dinner and the sermon on the Mount.The acting was good and each role filled out just wonderful . James Caviezel played the Jesus character unbelievably well , showing the Son of God as human as he can be through his fears of what 's to come but yet the courage to fulfill the will of God for the sake of his people . Mary Magdalene was done well too and I could n't help but feel what she was feeling when the whipping began . And the actress for Satan was just plain freaky . Satan never really talked much but you always felt Satan 's presence throughout each key point in the movie . I personally thought the scene with Judas ' betrayal and death was done very good with the kids tugging and tugging him during his guilt trip . Overall here , the acting was good enough in that everyone was showing their anguish over what was being done.Now for the gory parts : I personally felt it was n't that gory . I 'm not trying to put down the suffering Jesus went through because God knows I would not want to go through that at all . But there are hundreds of horror and suspense flicks out there that just pour buckets of blood that I would not recommend to the weak of heart and this one would not be on that same level with those flicks in terms of spilt blood . BUT it was graphic in the sense that Mel Gibson made every whipping and each nail that pierced Jesus ' flesh look real , nothing watered down , like you actually felt the pain ( I really cringed on that one whip shot that you most likely know of ) . So it was more of a psychological sense of intense violence in that it was bloody and it felt real.A couple of weaknesses I could point out would be explaining a couple of scenes to the non-believers . I 'm not sure they 'll understand why Satan was carrying a disfigured baby during the whipping ( I still do n't understand that part either ) or why Satan was screaming from the depths of hell . It 's not an entirely big deal but it would help to flesh out why this is occurring , even for a few more seconds but I know Mel would n't want to go off on tangents.Overall , this is something that needs to be seen , whether you 're Christian or not . I think if you can open your heart to this message that this could be a life-changing experience for the non-believer and a faith-strengthening experience for the believer . Put aside the controversies you 've heard of this being spiteful towards Jews and realize what WE as human beings have done to Him . WE persecuted Him and WE nailed him to the cross . This movie is about what one man went through to save us from sin and is a demonstration of the depth of God 's awesome and abundant love for us , that He is willing to part away of His own Son , to have him suffer so much because of the depths of our sin , to release us from that very sin . Keep that in mind when you 're ready to give the movie a fair shot .	1
This beautiful movie is criticised for being bloody , but The Blood Of Christ can not be understood today the way it was 800 years ago.Few people ( even among Christians ) can understand this movie . Its Truth is borne out by the degree to which it is hated - like Christ was.It is a medieval view of Jesus ' Passion that Mel Gibson gives us . Gibson , a product of the Medieval Tridentine Mass , is the only man who could do it.As Rev . Carter Heyward , Professor of Theology , Episcopal Divinity School said , `` [ The ] movie illuminates a medieval , not biblical , interpretation that it is the blood of Christ that saves humankind . Not Jesus ' life , not his healings or his wisdom , not his teaching or his compassion , not his passion for justice , but rather his death on the cross is what saves humankind ; and moreover , his death on the cross as willed by his Father God , who requires him to suffer this excruciating death as payment for the sins of the world . `` As a Protestant steeped all-too-often in the divinity of Christ - I loved the Catholic focus on the humanity of Christ - his blood , sweat , and tears . I loved the depiction of Pilate . Mary was wonderful . Satan was amazing . I could never have imagined such a Satan - and now I can not get its image out of my mindMel Gibson is a genius . This movie is a miracle . See it ; because such a movie will never happen again in our lifetime .	1
Bottom-line : The movie is powerful because it is a dramatic presentation of the final hours of Jesus ' life , from the Garden to the Grave . Viewers are invited to see how it really might have happened , even hearing the words as they were actually spoken ( with English subtitles , that proved effortless to follow ) . Jesus suffered and agonized in a very human , yet Spirit-empowered manner . Mary was both strong and broken ... what incredible suffering ! Romans and Jews came across realistically -- some hardened and cruel , others questioning and troubled . Christians will rediscover the gravitas of Christ 's sacrifice , and the depth of God 's love . Seekers will either be drawn or repulsed , depending on whether they ultimately accept the truth of this most troubling story . Enemies and opponents of the Christian faith will do as they have ... disect hints of unfairness , obsessiveness , or exclusiveness in this telling of the gospel story . After all , to those who do not believe , the Cross and its story are an offense , even according to the Bible.What the Passion is not : 1 . The Anti-Semitism charge is absurd . Jesus calls on the Father to forgive the sins of those present . He is shown fighting Satan , more than he is the Sanhedrin . Christians Scripture declare that we ( and Jesus ) battle spirits and principalities , not flesh and blood . Gibson cleverly included this aspect , by introducing demons and the Devil into the plot . 2 . Gratutiously violent . Yes , the scourging is brutal , as are the baring of the cross to Calvary , and the crufixion itself . However , the violence is real and natural , not the silly stuff one sees in horror and generically violent movies.The Passion of the Christ garners five stars for an original , passionate , powerful , and courageous approach to a 2000 year old story about how God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only son , so that if we believe in him , we 'll not die ... we 'll live -- really live !	1
Unlike the other Jesus movies of the past which portrayed Jesus ' suffering and death in a very & quot ; sugar-coated & quot ; manner , Gibson holds nothing back from the audience in this blood-soaked version of the & quot ; Stations of the Cross & quot ; .I do n't understand what some of the pastors and parents of young children were thinking about when they would tell reporters that they would take the kids to the opening of & quot ; Passion & quot ; back in February 2004 . THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN . And , as I saw at the theatre , there are a lot of adults that ca n't handle it , either.With more violence than you can shake a stick at , it is not a movie that you sit and enjoy a bucket of popcorn while watching it.With that said , I thought it was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time . I was on the edge of my seat while watching it , mainly because of the dread of knowing what was going to happen next , and the uncertainty of how the scourging and crufifixion were to be portrayed . Because of this , I feel like & quot ; Passion of the Christ & quot ; is more of something to be experienced for yourself.I highly recommend the movie , and I will be very surprised if it does not win a single Oscar next year .	1
With a box office total of about 200 million dollars at its 2nd week , The Passion is shaping up to be a box office hit of momentious perportions . Telling the story of Jesus ' last 12 hours , from the Gardens of Gesthamane to his blink of an eye ressurection , this movie imbeds the message of Christianity as powerfully as the nails that punctured Christ . By the end of the movie , almost everybody was in tears and was moved beyond comparison . My own father had to `` Depressure '' for about an hour to get all the sadness of this movie out of his system . I praise Mel Gibson for never giving up for what he believed in or caving in to controversy , because this is the most vivid and accurate account of The Last 12 Hours of Christ that has been potrayed to this day.Acting : The acting throughout this movie is top-notch even though it was cast in Aramaic , Latin , and Hebrew , so you have to rely on English subtitles to translate the words . The acting is dark , and the actors voices make your heart beat faster every time they talk . Jim Caviezel is the perfect choice for Jesus , as his voice seems to stand out from all the others , but towards the end he just grunts and does n't do all that much , but thats forgiveable . The standout in acting in my opinion came from Maia Morgenstern , who plays the brooding and grief-stricken Mary , who follows Jesus on his path to the cross and is by him until he utters his last words to her . Monica Belluci and whoever plays James play great supporting roles and really added to the movie . Also I love how the Devil follows Jesus to the cross and the scene where she is holding the Anti-Christ is one of the most memorable.Directing : Mel Gibson does an absolutely excellent job directing , as he pours his heart out into this movie . The way he casts a gloomy atmosphere over the movie will make most critics swoon . I loved the camera work ( Especially the slow-mo shots ) and I thought that I really was in Jerusalem 2000 years ago with the vivid images that you see . Excellent ! Mel Gibson will probably get at LEAST nominated for an Academy Award by the end of this year.Bottom Line : This is an epic motion picture that should be seen by all Christians and anybody trying to get into the religion . Do not listen to the liberals who call this movie Anti-Semitic , it just potrays what is written in the Gospels . I would not recommend this to anyone under 8 , as I think most kids over that age could handle the gore ( They might even learn a little latin ) Footnotes : This movie has a great score and I recommend the sountrack that was realeased at the time of the movie . Support this movie by go seeing it right now or seeing it again .	1
Ben Carson is an inspiration to hear and see about . His Faith is solid and a very big part of his life . This dvd is great to watch .	1
Everyone needs to see this movie . Proves that no matter what color your skin or financial background might be-you can make something of yourself . Plan on sharing this with my children and extended family . We need more positive role models like this-thank you Mr. Carson and a special thanks to his mother and all mothers/fathers who push their children to be be more then what they themselves believe their capable of .	1
BUY IT ! ! ! I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him . That was before I knew his life history . I was surfing to watch a movie ( any movie ) and came across & # 34 ; Gifted Hands. & # 34 ; As I watched it , I found myself saying what an incredible story it is . This movie will inspire you . I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children . It 's very , very good . I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children . She agreed that it 's the best docudrama she ever saw . She is inspired and acting on what inspired her . My husband ( not a movie fan ) watched it from beginning to end without complaint ! IT 'S GOOD !	1
A wonderful picture that is a true story about a great man . It is definitely a message of hope . Everyone should watch it .	1
Is your child struggling with low self-esteem ? laziness ? TV addiction ? reluctance to read books ? think that poor grades are cool and good grades are n't ? Are you a parent who is afraid to enforce TV/electronics restrictions ? trying to be your children 's & # 34 ; buddy & # 34 ; instead of their parent ? is your vision for your child too low ? This story is one I 've shared with others , such an amazing story !	1
Dr. Ben Carson , MD is an American treasure and this book tells you exactly why that is so . He is a model for our children and a great American with an astute understand of how he got to where he is in life today . This is a man not to be discounted but revered . Read this wonderful story aloud to your children , too .	1
This is very well done . The young actors who portray the doctor are excellent . The doctor 's personal trials provide an excellent foil for the medical challenge he faces .	1
Ben Carson was more then just a gifted surgeon , but a man who had drive and ambition within him that he did not even know he had . His mother was a great influence in his life and it shows in this movie about Ben Carson 's life . If you really want to know what drives a man then you need to get the movie . You will learn that what he said at the National Prayers Breakfast was real and that is why the media has since launched a campaign to keep him from advancing his philosophy on life .	1
GIFTED HANDS : THE BEN CARSON STORY could be reviewed as a documentary or at least contemporary historical/nonfiction because of the content . A young boy grows up to be a surgeon . He becomes a gifted doctor at a high profile hospital dealing with the toughest of cases . He performs miracles , and much can be attributed to the encouragement and mothering he received while he was growing up . Mom never gives up on her sons.GIFTED HANDS could also be reviewed as a story where the underprivileged and low achiever makes good . He builds within himself , with much reinforcement from his mother , an ambition and desire for learning . He accomplishes all that is within himself . He surpasses by light years what some expect from him being a fatherless , minority , wrong-neighborhood , disadvantaged sort of kid that is expected to become a burden on society , not a Johns Hopkins pediatric neurosurgery specialist . Boy makes good times ten.IS IT A LOW KEY CHRISTIAN DRAMA ? It could be considered that because this boy uses his personal faith , and seeks God 's help in overcoming his childhood frustrations and anger . As a neurosurgeon , he continues to use his faith , even admitting to the parents of his patients that he prays daily . No Bible pounding , or heavy handed preaching . As a matter of fact , most of the staunch religious will say this movie is not revealing faith at all . I disagree . It is the faith of a young boy , which grows into a man 's inner strength of knowing God as a helper , and in an assuming way , not flamboyant and boastful.REALISM -- HONEST IN THE TRENCHES LIVING is what this award worthy story is about . Ben Carson , even with his skills with a surgeons knife , also knows failure , struggle , and life sorrow that comes from a human inability to control every aspect of living . But he never stops trying , and he gets support from some teachers , mom , brother , wife , classmates , and many others along the way . But in the end , it is one man 's choice to do his very best , make his life `` shine and sparkle '' just like his mother did to floors while scrubbing and cleaning for others.This is one powerful , inspirational , biography of one life overcoming hardship and of becoming an overachiever . Dr Carson has a goodness within always striving to help others . You will be glad you watched , regardless of your own race , religion , or educational attainment.School counselors take note : here 's one for your office shelf to loan out .	1
Best film ever for inspiration and motivation , it is a must see for everone . He is a role model for all of us . THANKS	1
I most definitely do not agree with Dr. Ben Carson 's politics , but I most definitely admire his skill . It 's not a particularly great movie , but still worth watching . Actually , I purchased it because I really like Cuba Gooding Jr. and I was not disappointed in his portrayal of Dr. Carson . The rest of the casting is excellent , too . I ca n't say I love the movie because some of it goes a little slow for me , but there is always fast-forward ! If you like biographical-type movies like this then , by all means , purchase this DVD .	1
I stumbled across this movie on the Lifetime Movie Network ( do n't judge , I was doing housework at the same time ) . This movie is so inspiring and motivating . Cuba Gooding Jr is great at doing those kinds of movies . I love his acting . I love movies about people who overcome to become great	1
This DVD shows determination and fortitude and will set a good example for young people of today . Purchase yours today .	1
Inspiring true story about a Neurosurgeon . The first doctor to try a cutting edge operation on the brain . His mother was so supportive , encouraging & loving . Both he and brother became successful . Cuba Gooding presented a very good potrayal . Movie arrived in fine condition & quickly .	1
This is the life story of Dr. Ben Carson , chief of pediatric surgery at Johns Hopkins University and considered the world 's best pediatric surgeon . The story begins with Dr. Carson being asked to consider operating on the two sons of a German couple who are joined at the abdomen and skull . No one has ever performed this surgery successfully with both children surviving . The film then flashes back to the childhood of Dr. Carson . He was raised by an illiterate but very loving and determined single mother who married at the age of 13 and was divorced soon after when she discovered her 'husband ' was married at the same time to another woman with another family . She was determined that her two sons would not turn out the same way she did . It is an amazing story of this mother and her love and determination . Ben , not realizing he needed glasses , consistently performed way below the other students in class until his mother used all their savings to get him a pair . That , along with her firm hand in making the two boys read two books a week from the library ( along with written reports ) as well as limiting TV watching to two programs a week turned Ben into the 'student of the year ' in 8th grade . Even that , however , was tainted , as a teacher at the award ceremony berated the other students for letting a 'boy of color ' with serious disadvantages and a single mother outperform them . The story continues with his achievements and struggles through high school and his scholarship years at Yale and on to his residency at Johns Hopkins . The story then takes us back to the conclusion of the decision whether or not to operate on the German twins . It is an incredible story of someone who not only had the 'gifted hands ' needed to be a great surgeon but also the determination , humility and faith to make a life of great service to his fellow humans against great odds . The acting is outstanding . I would encourage everyone and every family to make this a 'must watch ' . I would also highly recommendSomething the Lord Made , another story about a great African-American surgeon , Dr. Vivian Thomas , who was born 30 years too early to be able to have the same opportunities as Dr. Carson , but nevertheless made a great contribution to medicine that is still being used today . Enjoy ! !	1
I 'm a teacher , and when I heard this movie was coming out on DVD , I was extremely excited . Dr. Carson 's life is so inspiring , and the message to students is very strong . Reading and education opened up a whole new world for him , and as a result , the world is blessed with one of the most outstanding neuro surgeons in the world ! The additional special features also introduces you to the real Dr. Carson where he shares his personal story . If you know of anyone who needs inspiration to believe in themselves , even when it seems everyone around them sees little hope for them , this is a great movie .	1
This is well acted and based on a true story . You will not be bored . I recommend it for a family .	1
excellent movie following the life of Ben CARson Doctor pediatric neuro surgery and his successful separation of siamese twins joined at the head . A movie to watch more than once ! Historical content .	1
This is one of the best , and I mean the best explanations of creation without getting `` mushy '' religious and anti-scientific . Often Christian views of creation are so anti-scientific and so prejudice that anyone truly wanting a balanced Chrisitan view that includes your mind is left out . This is the DVD for you . Challenging , thought provoking , even funny and entertaining at times , Rob Bell presents to you the best presentation for creation I 've ever viewed . You wo n't be disappointed.I am presenting this material for viewing in a mini-series to and for non-Christian , seeking-the-truth people . I 'm not ashamed to present this DVD to these people seeking God , yet skeptical and cautious of the Christian perspective .	1
Olivia de Havilland was superb in this movie . She is still captivating in this film from my past . Even though I knew the plot , I was still caught in the way it finally played out .	1
Richard Burton did a bit of overacting , but I did n't watch this movie to see him . I watched for an actor who never disappoints : Olivia de Havilland . She 's been my favorite ever since seeing & # 34 ; The Heiress. & # 34 ; This movie has a bit of suspense and a ending that might surprise some folks .	1
I have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who panned this movie on the basis that it is a Gothic melodrama . Just as I could not live on a steady diet of filet mignon or Beef Wellington , I would n't care to focus exclusively on great literature and art films . Besides , productions should be judged within their own genre and on their own merits.That said , My Cousin Rachel is a delight . Olivia de Havilland is gorgeous as the eponymous cousin , who may be a fortune hunter , a murderess , a charmingly worldly woman or perhaps a combination of any and all those things . Burton is young , passionate , obsessed , violent , generous , remorseful , suspicious and jealous -- the sort of man one would run from in real life , though by his skill , he makes his character sympathetic.Rachel falls short of being in the same category as Rebecca , simply because Rebecca was directed by the great master of suspense , Alfred Hitchcock , who could make a cliff , some ocean spume ( and judicious use of music ) appear portentous.I enjoyed every minute of this production . If you agree , and have n't yet seen the following , I would recommend : The Heiress , with de Havilland and Montgomery Clift - based on Henry James ' Washington Square ; and Hitchock 's Parradine Case , with Alida Valli ( one of the best femmes fatales ever ) , Gregory Peck and Louis Jordan .	1
THIS JUST IN : THE NOODLE HAS WON THE RACE !	1
Props to the makers of this ingenious little movie . To say anything is to give away all the gags , which are hilarious . If you are a fan of Star Wars , there 's really no reason not to love this short film . My friend and I about died laughing at some of the injokes.I guess my only complaint would be that I wish it were longer , to satisfy my thirst for more of this movie .	1
This documentary does demonstrate the many evil deeds enacted by Stalin ( and could 've added more ) and I 'm glad there is a documentary that demonstrates some level of `` parity '' between the more `` obvious '' evil Adolf Hitler and the less `` obvious '' evil Josef Stalin . It also does a great job at exposing the way-too-comfortable relationship between the Nazis and the Soviets during 1939-41 . And it definitely demonstrated that there was anti-Semitism in both the Nazi and Soviet camps.All that being stated , I have 3 problems with this documentary.1 ) In terms of just providing balance , it would 've been worth noting the heroism of the Red Army between 1941-45 in stopping Nazi aggression and providing a solid Eastern Front ( at the cost of over 14 million soldiers ) that helped the Allies as a whole defeat Nazi Germany . Even the most right-wing person could recognize that the Allies ' task of defeating Hitler would 've been much harder , if not impossible , without the tremendous help from the Soviets . Yes , the Red Army committed atrocities too ( as did the other Allies to a much smaller extent ) but it was part of the necessary war to defeat Hitler.2 ) The idea of the Nazis being just `` junior Communists '' is just ludicrous . Yes , both believed in totalitarian systems . Yes both believed in murder and repression in order to maintain rule . However , the Nazis were `` Socialist '' in name only ( and that was to acquire votes in German elections prior to 1933 ) . Hitler despised Bolshevism ( and what he called Judeo Bolshevism ) . Hitler 's idol was Frederick the Great ( hint , not a Socialist ) and Hitler wanted a return to a `` Prussian '' empire . He considered as friends Mussolini and Franco and backed Franco and his Fascists in the Spanish Civil War . The Soviets supported the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War . If the Nazis and Soviets were so `` chummy '' , then how come Hitler decided to launch Operation Barbarossa in the first place ( the documentary completely neglects this ) ? Why did Stalin respond with such ferocity ( the documentary completely neglects this too ) ? 3 ) Marx/Engles may have called for mass executions and Lenin did order executions be carried , but neither one is on the scale or ideology of Stalin . Stalin was his own creature and not a blind follower of Marxist-Leninist ideology . In fact , while Stalin claimed to support the beliefs of the Marxist-Leninists , he had no problem ordering the executions of many of them including Trotsky , who denounced him , and Kirov , who supported him but was too much of a threat . Stalin has more in common with Ivan the Terrible than he does with Lenin . It 's quite telling that all the original Party members ended up dead under Stalin 's rule ( with Trotsky , I believe , being the last holdout ) . The documentary paints the picture that it was the teachings of Marx-Engles and Lenin that drove Stalin to cause the deaths of over 20 million Russians which denies Stalin 's own psychological makeup as the true cause of this scale of death . It 's quite telling that when Khrushchev took power after Stalin 's death , he set out to de-Stalinize the Soviet Union but kept Marx and Lenin in , implying just how rogue Stalin was.This documentary would 've been more credible if it just focused on Stalin , his atrocities , and the troubling thought that there are people in Russia ( including its leaders ) today who are willing to ignore these atrocities altogether and focus on how `` great '' Stalin was . `` Blood on the Snow '' is a much better documentary for this . Linking all these deaths to the Communist Manifesto is just intellectually dishonest .	1
Thanks to repeated government indoctrination and Hollywood & # 34 ; political correctness & # 34 ; , everybody knows the Nazis were bad guys who murdered Jews.But , there 's much more to that story - - -This movie , & # 34 ; THE SOVIET STORY & # 34 ; , reveals how Hitler and the Nazis learned their extermination methods by copying Stalin and the Soviets , with whom they were formally allied for many years , and even after the war , the Soviets continued to use the Nazi concentration camps.Everyone needs to see this movie.I 've bought extra copies to as gifts for friends and family .	1
Nowdays , most Americans do not know who Stalin or even Hitler was ( but they know 50 cent ) , so this movie would confuse most in the USA . Hitler and Stalin were both Communists and were basically on the same team . Marx called for the elimination of `` Trash Races '' like the Lithuanians , Poles , Britons , etc . He said those races were too backward to be revolutionary ! So much for all of you `` Useful Idiot '' commies . George Bernard Shaw is on the video calling for the development of a poison that would be humane and kill rapidly ( Zyklon B ) . A lot of information that would not be aired in the USA as it caused a big furor in Europe.The same Blood bankers that created communism then are still running London and Washington and this movie alludes to that .	1
This is also a gift for my boyfriend and he watched it as soon as it came in the mail . It was very interesting to watch . Would recommend for anybody to watch	1
Good	1
This is made word for word out of the Bible -the book of Matthew . It is very well made and a great way to meditate on God 's Word daily . It never gets old and you will find yourself remembering Scripture by picturing the scenes that go along with the Scriptures.It show Jesus as the well balanced God Man out of the book of Matthew . Some movies portray Jesus as some prune facedbeing -stern and cold . This video does n't do this . It can be a great gift for others also.I have purchased quite a few copies and given them away as gifts.You will never go wrong with God 's Word - The Bible.I will continue to buy it and I recommend it to everyone .	1
True to the Book of Matthew ! We need to understand that the Bible is 'God breathed ' , and present it as it is ! David L. Odom	1
Touted as the movie showing the & # 34 ; joyful & # 34 ; Jesus , this does not disappoint . In its novel approach of using only the words of the New International Version 's Gospel of Matthew , this movie captures a rarely seen essence of Jesus , that of the caring , loving , charismatic , and encouraging Savior . Bruce Marchiano performs the role of the Christ brilliantly , avoiding the unfortunate stereotypes given by previous actors who showed Jesus as solemn , unsmiling , pious , and even condescending . In the scene of Jesus walking on the water during a storm , he beckens Peter to walk from the boat to him . Peter does , but upon seeing the waves , he becomes scared , begins sinking , and cries out to Jesus . The written text , & # 34 ; Oh , you of little faith ! Why did you doubt ? & # 34 ; , makes it sound as if Jesus is berating Peter . However , in this portrayal , Jesus ( Marchiano ) pulls Peter to him , laughs and hugs him as he says this , as he would to a kid brother who fumbled a football . No anger or judgement , just encouragement as he then walks Peter to the boat.The movie is filled with examples of Jesus being human , laughing with his friends , discussing matters of faith and helping those in need , crying with joy over triumphs , and with sadness over loss . Considerably less graphic in its depiction of the crucifixion than The Passion of Christ , this movie conveys the pain and horror in a manner that could leave some viewers a little queasy . It is as realistic portrayal of Jesus and his times as I 've seen , and one that truly shows that this was the Son of God . The supporting cast , cinematography and the musical score make this a most engaging production.It is four hours long , and while it can make for a great Saturday afternoon of video , it can be intense enough to want to break it up into two or three viewing sessions . & # 34 ; Matthew & # 34 ; is also well suited to Bible studies for adults and teens .	1
This brought the Book of Matthew alive for me . I would recommend this to anyone , no matter age or gender . You will see the Book of Matthew alive . Awesome . Bruce Marchiano is wonderful as Jesus .	1
I simply adore this movie ! It is completely Biblically accurate , using a word for word translation from the Bible yet so highly entertaining . This is the Jesus I think of when I think of Christ . The actor does such a splendid job at portraying what I believe the true Christ would have been like . I 've never seen a Jesus on screen better than this.The Visual Bible was a very appropriate name for this portrayal of the book of Matthew . It IS the Bible made alive visually . Do n't miss this movie . Buy it NOW .	1
One of the better movies on the life of Christ . Stays faithful to Matthew 's Gospel . Appreciate the warmth and compassion the actor projects .	1
This is a great alternative to Yoga for Christians . None of the mind moving mumbo jumbo , with great exercisesand learning scripture at the same time . Highly recommend	1
JOE AND STEVE PLAY ALMOST THE SAME . Eric has so much talent . I only wish I could hear more Eric Johnson !	1
Anyone that enjoys watching a virtuoso play will enjoy this DVD . There are a few minor production flubs , and I wish they would have included at least one of Johnson 's more popular songs . Picture and sound are very good . These guys are at the very top of the list of guitar players and all 3 together is breathtaking .	1
After reading some of the other reviews I really do n't have much more to add . However in my opinion it 's as good as the other 's have said and then some . I own three of these 3G concert versions , and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three . It 's too bad they did n't make that a tridition with all three , but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit ... .A good collection to own if you 're in to exteremly hot guitar licks ... .	1
As other reviewers have pointed out , this is indeed a stellar concert , but there are two problems that plague it:1 . Camera Angles : The entire video recording is very 'amateur ' , to say the least . Most of Jeff is captured with very bad lighting , sometimes he is obscured in the dark completely . Also , the camera sometimes lingers on the same spot for too long with no other angles to speak of ( possibly because there were no other cameras ? ) and even if you 're a huge Jeff fan ( as I am ) , this could be tiresome.2 . The Sound : I was not entirely happy with the audio of this recording . Most of it is obscured by the audience screaming and there is a perceptible hiss that runs through the background permanently . This is not a good thing at all . In fact , some songs that require a delicate rendition such as 'Lilac Wine ' have possibly been ruined by the weak transfer of audio . I suspect the original recording itself was n't that clear , which is why.3 . Special Features : Now , heres the thing . When Jeff had only one actual studio album in his lifetime , how on earth would a 'Discography ' section benefit a true fan of his ? It does not make any sense . Of course you get listings of everything he 's ever worked on ( such as 'Sketches ' and his earlier collaboration album ) but I would hardly call this a special feature.The good part of this is that this remains the only officially commissioned Jeff Buckley video recording out there . Under Mary , his mother , much more archived video has been promised to us , his fans . As a starter kit , this works fine . Jeff was ON this night , and brought a lot of tenderness to his performance . Watching this more than ten years since his death , its very nostalgic and inspiring . Then you think of whats on the radio these days and miss the time when you could actually listen to Jeff Buckley on radio . Where have those days gone ? I consider Jeff Buckley to be the closest thing to a perfect male musician . Apart from his obvious ethereal beauty , his voice remains truly a divine gift that has n't diminished in its ' resonance through the years . I think that had he lived , he would certainly be regarded as some sort of pioneer . Sadly , all we have are remnants such as this DVD release . Get this today . Like I said , its not great , but its all we have of Jeff.Five Stars for the man and his music . Three Stars for the DVD . I 'm rounding the rating out to a total of four Stars .	1
Jeff Buckley fans are very lucky to have this sort of a DVD release . It took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan ( and now there is no turning back ) . I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in 1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah ( who did n't ? ) and also So Real , but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a unique singer . Later on , after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came out , I became much more interested . Mystery White Boy further solidified my fascination for his way of doing things , and now , with this Live In Chicago DVD , I am completely convinced . A little late , I admit.I wonder , while writing this review , if this is the best place to start , for the new-comer . I think it is . Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating vocals , but later , I guarantee , that will be precisely what you love about him . His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo , to a hyena 's laugh , to a goldfish burble , to a puma 's roar . And his guitar playing can trigger memories of This Mortal Coil , The Mission , and Johnny Marr ( he makes two Smiths references on this DVD , one of which is a parody of a Morrissey-style song about policemen ! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I Know It 's Over to Hallelujah ) . Whatever hints of influences glisten through his songs , they are undoubtedly his , meaning : It sounds like Jeff Buckley . He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic sweep through the central nervous system . And to see this is amazing . His lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a certain part of your own life ( or at least that 's how it feels ) . Lines like , & quot ; My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder & quot ; are so intimate and so precise , you wonder why nobody has come up with it before . And I ca n't help but wonder when he sings & quot ; Father do you hear me , do you know me , do you even care ? & quot ; ( What Will You Say ) if he is singing to his father , Tim Buckley , who he did not know.If you are like me and you enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like , then you will love this film . Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering of Big Star 's 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks , & quot ; You 're just like Saint Joan ... & quot ; with sweat dripping from his hair ( on Mystery White Boy he barely whispers the same line , mind you ) , then after the song is pretty much over , he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being appropriate for such a song and does this for some time , ending up by the speakers , playing to them creating the type of feedback you 'd expect at a Crazy Horse audition . Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams , featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave ( or something ) sharing the vocals then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows ( I think that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life , for obvious reasons ) . Then again , the audience deserved that sort of hurl . They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play Hallelujah , and he seems bothered by it . He eventually gives them a piece of his mind ( which I will not describe ) and seems to play most of the remaining set behind closed eyes , as if , for himself.The DVD is coupled with a documentary/interview that is captivating . He speaks so tenderly about music , like some do about love . And throughout are performances that are equally haunting . Not to mention the two acoustic versions.It 's good , get it .	1
I was a big Jeff Buckley fan before Grace was released , the Live at Sine ' EP CD was so great i was primed and ready when Grace hit the shelves . I turned at least several friends on to Jeff and for a while felt I was the only one who had even heard of him . When Last Goodbye hit the radio I was ecstatic . After all this i passed up at least 2 opportunities to see him live during his tours in 1995 and 1996 . This DVD made me regret those decisions even more . As has been stated , THIS IS THE WAY A CONCERT DVD SHOULD BE . Live in Chicago blew me away . I thought I knew what to expect . I knew it would be a good concert . I bought the Mystery White Boy CD that was recently released , and thought THAT was an eye opener . This DVD leaves the CD WAY behind . All i can say is if you never saw Jeff in concert , you owe it to yourself to experience something like this . He was not a & quot ; star & quot ; or an & quot ; icon & quot ; . Jeff Buckley was a life . So Real .	1
Live in Chicago is an excellent release for Jeff Buckley fans who never got to see Buckley in concert . Not only did he come alive on a stage , but he became more human and interesting . Here the imperfections are intact which sometimes make for the best performances . There are spurts of humor , improvised lyrics , and touching spots of Jeff relating to the audience . This is n't a particularly important concert ; it is n't his first nor his last . However , it 's being average works well to provide insight into what a typical Buckley concert would be . One word describes it : amazing . The extra features are just as good . There are two acoustic tracks of So Real and Last Goodbye as well as an Electronic Press Kit with interviews with Jeff.The camera work is not extremely professional or glamorous . It seems to be recorded on a home video camera with some abilities in effects and use of several angles , but this is no-frills videography . That is not what makes the DVD great ; Jeff does that . Buckley is uninhibited and lost in his songs . During Mojo Pin , mid-note he seems startled by the audience 's reaction to his singing as if he had forgotten they were there . He often closes his eyes , deep in his own world of memories and thoughts gone by . Though the DVD was recorded years ago , it flows well and still seems spontaneous ( although the track list is available on the back cover ) .The other band mates do not seem as into the music as Jeff , so Buckley is the focus of the show , the obvious front-man . But he does not neglect his friends either.The end of the performance gives us Jeff with his eyes filled with adoration for his fans saying , `` I love you too . '' This is perhaps one of the best gifts current Buckley fans could get , the affirmation that with the intense love fans have for Buckley , he had love for them too and extreme love for performing.Jeff could teach us all a thing or two about music .	1
This DVD of Mozart 's Don Giovanni is a really good one by my standards . The top-notch cast , brilliant scenery and costumes , and wonderful orchestra make this one of my favorite Don 's ever . I personally do n't like Herbert von Karajan , but I learned to tolerate him . Samuel Ramey as the vile Don was a great casting decision . He blends vivacity and vileness it one very impressive package . Anna Tomowa-Sintow is a brilliant Donna Anna . Her high notes are absolutely stunning and sings with a firm foundation . The Don Ottavio of Gosta Winbergh is stunning , but he lacked something . Nevertheless he was very pleasing . The Commendatore of Paata Burchuladze is good for all that he 's in . Now for the best : Julia Varady as Donna Elvira . I think she was Karajan 's substitute for Agnes Baltsa but Varady surpasses her in EVERY way . She is velvety-voiced and gives light to the aguishly played Elvira . The Leoporello of Ferrucio Furlanetto is very pleasing . Kathleen Battle as Zerlina was also a good casting call . Alexander Malta as Masetto is a little guff now and then but gives a solid performance . A good DVD for an expert or a beginner .	1
This is a fine film record of Mozart 's Don Giovanni from a Salzburg produciton from the 1980s . It is a nicely paced , well-staged production with some excellent singing . Samuel Ramey really acts the part of the Don with great zest and other characters both sing and act their parts very well . The staging is pretty much traditional . I thought one very nice touch was at the end of the opera when the statue appears -- the backdrop consists of gorgeous astronomical images and the Don is engulfed into these images as he dragged to hell.Von Karajan conducts a superb orchesteral performance that is somewhat on the spacious side , but which in no way drags . He definitely captures the humor of the score , especially the Leporello scenes . The sound quality of the DVD is excellent , comparable to a good set of CDs , with very nice balance between the voices and the orchestra . Eveything on the DVD is very clearly recorded and von Karajan really brings out the details in the score . There is , on the downside , a modest amount of stage noise.The DVD has very ample tracking and comes with subtitles and good program notes . It is definitely a very good Don Giovanni to have .	1
This is the best Don Giovanni I 've ever seen . Samuel Ramey is commanding in the lead . Costumes and staging are wonderful . Furlanetta is a great Leporello and has gone on to play this role for years all over the world . I think Varady is an especially strong Elvira and the ending is , by far , the best Giovanni ending of all time . Of course , Von Karajan 's conducting is perfect .	1
I 'm ten years old and I love Elomo 's world . I mean I have n't watched in a year . When I 'm bored it 's fun to laugh at how funny , In my way of age , to see such a baby show . It 's like teenagers watching Winnie the Pooh . They still like it.It 's like for a period of time you are little and like it and then in like first grade you hate it and think it 's babyish then in about 5th grade there are no more shows on and you just look on tv and you watch it . I laugh at those things todlers would would listen to . To me it 's entertaining ! LAlalala Elmo 's world !	1
I bought this video because my daughter loves dogs and other animals . I also bought it because there is a segment on babies - as we are having a baby in a few months , I thought it would be good to expose her to little babies . My daughter this loves this video . She asks to watch it multiple times every day . Sometimes we have to hide it . She laughts at Elmo and really relates to all the animals and babies that are shown in the segments.The video is divided into 3 full length segments of Elmo 's World - one on babies , one on dogs , and one on farm animals . My daughter loves each one . Plus they are very educational . If there is a new baby on the way , I DEFINITELY recommend this video as a tool to teach your toddler about babies . It discusses how to play with babies and what newborns are like .	1
I like this kickboxing workout because it is challenging , but also teaches you the kicks and punches that you are using . It is my first kickboxing DVD . I can tell that Kathy Smith is n't as practiced at kickboxing as the other two instructors are . So I find myself watching them to make sure that I am executing the moves correctly . This one takes a lot of energy , and on really high days , it has a challenge segment . But I do n't believe that it is as intense as TaiBo , from what I have read.The only thing that bothers me is that when I chose to do the challenge , the DVD plays the stretching segment first . I have gotten the impression that it was not set up very well . I end up having to manually chose the segments that I want to do . Oh , it has a great Tai Chi stretching segment as well . I just found that the other day .	1
Kathy Smith 's Kickboxing Workout is a fun , mostly well-cued , and easy-to-follow workout . A variety of different punches and kicks are incorporated into cardio routines that get the heart rate up and make you feel invincible ! I like how Kathy starts out by discussing safety with martial arts expert Keith Cooke . One important she and Keith stress throughout the workout is go at your own pace and not worry about kicking high or punching super hard.After the 10 minute warm-up , Kathy goes into a high-energy 25-minute workout . I like how she introduces the leg work ( e.g . pivots ) before she introduces the punches , focusing on good form . She also does n't go straight into kicking ( she does & quot ; side folds & quot ; to prepare you for the kicks ) . Throughout the tape you see clips of Keith doing the kicks and punches from different angles to help have good form . As a bonus , the tape includes thigh and buns kicking drills and back and abs stability exercises.When I first started doing the workout , I felt that she did n't cue on time and would announce a new adjustment after she started doing it . However , after doing the workout a couple of times , I knew what to expect so it was n't as much of an issue . I find the workout highly addictive and the time flies by really quickly . The more I do the workouts , the more energy I have during the workouts and after .	1
I sort of fell upon this video by Smith on accident while browsing the library shelves for a yoga fix . I like Tae Bo , and so I thought I would check this one out for a change of pace . ( I like Billy Blanks a lot , but some days I just need to spend time with other people . Hee hee . ) I enjoyed the video a lot , so I bought the DVD.I think the DVD is a lot better than the video . You can correct me if I am wrong , but the DVD has a lot of extra goodies on it that I do not recall seeing on the video . Some of the extra goodies include a 15-minute Tai Chi workout with Kelly ( the red-haired woman ) and a few basic martial arts lessons with Keith Cooke ( also approximately 15 minutes ) . I do not find it as challenging as the Tae Bo `` Get Ripped '' workouts , but it still does its job extremely well and I enjoy it very much.Just keep in mind that this workout is in no way any kind of lesson in self-defense . This is a kickboxing workout . It is not a tutorial in streetfighting any more than a boot-camp workout would be a tutorial in how to fight in a combat zone.= )	1
I am a mother of a 10 month old . She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it . I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD ! As you know for a 10 month old that is unusually ! But she loves it that much ! I have a Nephew that is 2 years old and he just loves it as well ! I recommend any parent out there that wants a educational fun Video/DVD for there child ages 6 months- 6 years this one is GREAT ! ! ! !	1
My 20 month old loves this film ! ! ! He watches it and even tries to count with them . He knows the names of the characters too . It is a very colorful newer production as opposed to some of the films that have a bright cover but are really films from the early 90s . It does have a few throwback scenes in it which are all good . I would recommend this movie ! ! !	1
My 14-month old daughter has watched this several dozen times already , and she still picks this one out when given a choice between this or another Sesame Street video . She loves Ernie and Elmo , both of whom appear regularly in the show , and while she still is n't saying her numbers , I 'm pretty sure she 's getting the concepts figured out . I also make sure to interact with her to help reinforce the concepts and help keep her focused.Even though I 've watched it with her for at least half of those viewings , I generally enjoy watching it with her . Part of the reason is the different segments are well-done and actually have the occassional bit of adult humor ( e.g. , the `` counting crows '' who sing about 3 -- supposedly the source for the band 's name ) , and also for the things that happen in the background as Ernie interacts with Benny and the Dinger ( for instance , when Ernie dings the Dinger for the first time , watch the action in the background -- it 's quite funny , and definitely targeted for the adults who are watching along ! ) .	1
I bought this on video at a local thrift shop to try it out before getting one on DVD . I have to say that he does like it alot . He 's been watching it since he was 13 months and he still enjoys it . However , its purely an entertainment thing for him . He also has the Learning About Letters DVD since he was smaller , and same thing -- totally entertainment . Story line is not a really issue for him . He just likes seeing Bird Bird and the other characters .	1
I wish CTV would consider reissuing `` Sesame Street '' as a chronological series , starting with `` Season One , '' and working their way to the present ... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast , not with a few select bits chopped up into the new , modern mix . The old shows were so wonderful ... plus that awful , whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen ! Anyway , that 's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own ... PS - yay , Sesame Street !	1
At least I thought so ! I keep up a very tight workout schedule , and `` mix up '' my workouts to include weights and aerobics . I just tried the `` Latin Rhythm Workout , '' and it was great ... all I need now is a partner ! I would say that I am an `` intermediate '' in aerobics , and believe it or not , I was having such a good time ( as were my animals watching me ! ) the time flew by and the first section was finished before I knew it . My heart rate was mildly elevated , but as with most aerobics , once one knows the moves , or keeps it up , one can `` pump it up , '' so to speak . I went right into the second section , and could not finish because the dancing kept up-tempo , and as I really `` got into it , '' I felt that I had `` had it , '' so to speak . If you are looking for something a little different to add to your aerobic routines , try the Latin Dancing ... the dancers are very good and seem to be having a good time ; there are a few individuals standing along the upper side of the dance floor dancing along , and there is one dancer in the back who seems to be making silly faces every so often ( which is noticed after working out several times ! ) I will give Kathy Smith an `` A '' for keeping her workouts fresh , plus she 's actually pretty good ! She also gives Clara Basset , the very excellent dancer who assisted in choreographing this video , some time , since I have noticed that in most of Kathy 's videos , she does not like to give time to `` others '' if she can help it ! In this case , it is quite appropriate to let the very lively Clara show off some of those latin moves ! A live band ( well , it says live , but I wondered how much was actually live music , and how much was canned ) really adds to the atmosphere , and one can make the most of this workout . I also found it a bit odd in the beginning , I could not quite figure out what was `` strange , '' but the video cuts from the dance floor to a blue carpeted , enclosed room that has painted conga and bongo drums on it , and back to the dance floor in sinc with the moves , music , and commentary ! Mainly , this workout is fun . One can learn the basics of some of the most popular latin dances and really get those hips and legs moving ! It is perfect for beginners , and as one progresses , one can really get into the moves and `` dance '' to the whole tape . What is even better , if you are ever invited to go `` clubbin ' , '' you will NOT be left behind since you are learning some of the most popular and fun Latin dancing steps : The Merenge ' , the Cha Cha , and the Salsa . Very fun , effective , and truly an added `` spice '' to any workout for beginner 's to intermediate . Just be ready to get those hips and legs movin ' !	1
Unlike the other reviewers I find that by modifying the intensity of the dance moves in this work out you can get your heart rate up to your target zone . There is a dancer in a white t-shirt directly behind Kathy who really 'moves ' and if you follow her arm movements etc ... you will break a sweat . I enjoy doing this video and find it inspires my 14 year old daughter to get off the couch and cha cha with me !	1
Kathy Smith has always amazed me with her hard workouts that she makes fun and energizing .	1
This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD 's I 've purchased for my two parrots . They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo . They actually talk back to him when he says , `` Hello '' . I find his voice a little annoying after a time , but I guess it 's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like . He 's also a very lively character along with Grover , Kermit , Cookie Monster , Bert , and Ernie , the rest of the Sesame Street cast . The songs , as always in Sesame Street , are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour . And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll , the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie . So longer is better . This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story . The `` people '' actors , Keri Russell , Kathy Najimy , Caroll Spinney , French Stewart , Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults . They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable . It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers ( as in human children ) would enjoy too . It 's colorful , has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids ( or parrots ) and get them involved in the story . I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street , whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys . With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I 'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing , as always . Two thumbs up !	1
Paul gilbert showing some of his favorite chops , a true innovator of the 80'sguitar era with racer x/mr.big and his solo work ! ! ! !	1
Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things do n't necessarily go together . His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping . I really do n't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument . Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion , and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works . I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I 've purchased over the last thirty years , and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three . If you are at all interested in shred guitar , you simply have to buy this . Many of us paid $ 40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos ( parts I and II ) , so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price . Thanks , Paul !	1
Melissa Cross has just broken a new boundary that is over a decade in the making : Rage 101.Her motivations seem sincere . Her intentions are to teach the up and coming youth , and in some cases established singers , how to sing raging/screaming vocals without shredding their vocal chords . Thats always good . Friends have asked for years how vocalists scream for three hours a night , a couple hundred times a year , and still have enough voice remaining to order a pizza on friday . Well , here 's the answer.Melissa has spanned her advice and techniques over two discs , and cover every aspect of the artform . Art ? Yes . For those of you scratching your heads , Emotional ( Emo ) Hardcore with its stark contrasts of harsh realities and sweet essences creates some of the most moving bits of music you 'll ever hear . As Melissa points out , a great scream is one which covers every frequency in the spectrum , from thrashing highs to rumbling lows , all coherant.Many associate `` screaming '' vocals with untallented hipsters cowling in their mothers basement , churning out pointless discs of noise . Not true my friend . Here are a few discs you should check out : `` Skillet : Collide '' `` Emery : the weaks end '' `` Slipknot : Volume 3 . '' and any System of a Down disk . There are literally thousands of examples out there . These vocals are sometimes scattered throughout the music world , even in places where they would n't be expected . Maybe you know a few ? On the same note , there are those who have other preferences in music , thats fine too . To each his own.The Zen of Screaming is a tool for the future generation who pour their feelings upon scattered papers , bursting their internal furies of love , life and experiences into the ears of willing listners . ( PS - Huge thanks to Melissa Cross on her feedback for my review . Hope things continue to flourish for you ! )	1
Wow ! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions . I went to school during the revisionist period of our country . What a bunch of lies we learned in school . I too believed in the statement `` Separation of Church and State '' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country . We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers . We have been asleep at the wheel way to long , and I want to thank David again for waking me up . I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation	1
You can never go wrong when you learn about our country and how things began and the people behind our great country , if you want to learn and be amazed at how it all began then buy this series .	1
This DVD series takes us back to our Christian Heritage . It is amazing . I recommend to any group that wants to know the true beginnings of our nation .	1
Just discovered this movie and the second Mandie movie . Both are excellent . They follow the books fairly well . The casting is good too . My daughter has read most of the books and enjoyed the movies immensely . I highly recommend this movie .	1
Sean Astin does a great job portraying a youth pastor on a camping trip with his small youth group . Wonderful telling of the story of Hosea and the amazing love of God .	1
This is a really good movie . Both my husband and I enjoyed it . I am just happy that the story of Hosea is finally out on dvd . The only thing is ..i wish they would have explained `` harlot '' better and how back in that time period how big of a thing it really was . I dont see this as winning souls because without a background of understanding-it does not produce anything . BUT i can see this being used as a tool in sunday school or children 's church to `` HELP '' give a visual of the story of Hosea . Also think this would be a GREAT movie for movie & popcorn night at the church ( if the church ever did this ) . ALso great movie to show teens-but it is kind of slow and younger children will probably not be interested at all in this ( age 10 and under ) . So to be perfectly honest -i am not sure sunday school or children 's church would work all that well.Other than that -- it is a good movie and will help people to dig a little deeper in the bible to find out why God told Hosea to go and marry a harlot-Gomer .	1
very very good movie , every one should see this movie . you can see why people should always be nice to everybody	1
I remember this program from when I was a child . I was impressed then and I still am now . This may not be everyone 's cup of tea , but if you are looking for a good old time you may enjoy this one .	1
The Exterminator Blu-ray ReviewDistributor : Synapse Films ( US ) For a movie that contains such visual delights as beatings , burning , beheading , forced prostitution and the painfully slow decent of another unfortunate victim into a working meat grinder , it is no wonder that the The Exterminator has had its share of controversy over the years.Robert Ginty plays an ordinary every day guy who after a particularly nasty attack on his best friend , sets about dispatching the criminal element of 1980 's New York in ways which would give even Jigsaw nightmares . Highlights of vengeance include extreme facial surgery involving a group of hungry rats , poison tipped bullets and the previous mentioned incident where the local gangster is quite literally turned into a string of sausages . Even the family dog does n't escape unharmed in this one folks ! With the varying amounts of violence on display , it is no wonder that the film has suffered numerous cuts over the years , however it is the gritty realism of the film itself rather than any one particular gore scene which ultimately unnerves the viewer and actually makes for a pretty good story beneath all of the carnage.Released on Blu-ray by Synapse Films on a region free disc , the film is presented in its fully uncut directors print which features all of the gore excised from previous releases . Synapse have gone to town on this release and have invested in a brand new 2k scan from the original materials which has produced a quality 1080p 1.78:1 transfer of the film that put simply is stunning . Detail is sharper than ever before with colours and black levels appearing really well defined . Film grain is rightfully present throughout the picture which only enhances the overall atmosphere and for anyone who is used to watching previous versions of the movie , this new print will be a revelation.Audio tracks are available in a choice of DTS Mono and original restored Stereo mixes , both of which are trouble free and sound clear and well balanced . Admittedly the low budget roots of the film will ensure that the soundtrack will never compete with the latest modern day blockbusters , however there really is nothing to complain about here , with both dialogue and action scenes being clean and well represented.Extras wise there is not a great deal available in this package , however what is here is largely very good . Firstly there is an informative commentary track by the films director which covers every conceivable angle relating to the films production , locations , release and even his personal views on the films sequel . As far as commentaries go this really is one of the better ones and fans of the film will find plenty of interest . Rounding this off , there are the usual theatrical trailers and some TV spots which also make a nice addition . Although a couple of extra documentaries would have been most welcome , the excellent commentary track more than makes up for any shortfall.All things considered , this Blu-ray release should be considered as a must buy purchase for fans of the film . Casual viewers will also find plenty to like and as a classic example of 1980 's exploitation movie making , the film still has plenty to offer . With a UK Blu-ray release coming soon from Arrow Video which is said to use the same quality transfer and contain additional extra features , there is a clear choice to import this US release or wait until November for the UK disc . Worth noting however is that the Arrow release contains an altogether different audio commentary track with the films producer and at this time it remains unconfirmed whether the original Stereo soundtrack option will be present on their release . For real fans of the film or for people who remain undecided there is of course always the option of a double purchase.One things for certain The Exterminator has never looked or sounded better , further proving that older low budget films really can have a new lease of life on Blu-ray . `` If You 're Lying ... ..I 'll Be Back ! `` BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for reviews of the less mainstream releases find us on Facebook or at blureviewobscura .yolasite .com	1
LikeDeath Wish ( 1974 ) , The Exterminator ( 1980 ) features a man engaged in vigilantism , on the streets of New York City . He does n't get top billing , but Robert Ginty is clearly the center of attention , in this tale of revenge , as a former soldier employs his fighting skills in a new arena . Not the toughest or most charismatic guy around , Ginty might appear an unlikely choice for such a gritty tale , but he brings a certain sense of realism to the role , and is just a fun guy to watch in action.After having served together in Viet Nam , army buddies John Eastland ( Ginty ) and Michael Jefferson ( Steve James ) , return to civilian life . Working at a food warehouse in NYC , they have a fight with three men trying to steal beer . The punks , who are members of a gang called the Ghetto Ghouls , later ambush Jefferson , and do permanent damage to his spine.Without any hesitation , Eastland is on a quest for retribution . He tracks down the men , blasts one with an M-16 , and leaves the other two to be ravaged by rats . Looking to get some money for Jefferson 's family , Eastland next targets a mob leader , who has extorted money from workers like Jefferson . The sensational crimes , are investigated by a police detective named Dalton ( Christopher George , The Rat Patrol ) , who tries to find a clue , in the carnage that `` The Exterminator '' leaves behind . The CIA is also involved , and have their own twisted agenda . When Dalton closes in on Eastland , the Government steps in to close the books on the Exterminator.At the time , Robert Ginty ( 1948-2009 ) was mostly known for his work in TV , likeThe Black Sheep Squadron , and The Paper Chase , but he 's quite good here , playing a man that is compassionate , yet hardened to violence . The Exterminator works efficiently , without a lot of emotion , as events play out without a lot of pretense . The story does n't always flow smoothly , the production is a little unpolished , and the ending somewhat forced , but The Exterminator is still a very enjoyable revenge flick.Most of the material restored in the 104 minute unrated director 's cut , are apparently action or gore related . A gruesome burned corpse that appears briefly , is really nicely done . As is the war footage that opens the film , which features a decapitation , and a spectacular fall . Although the Bluray is probably the best the film will ever look , it is pretty grainy in a number of places . Robert Ginty has unfortunately passed away , but director James Glickenhaus provides a thoughtful and informative commentary , that puts the film in some context.The success of The Exterminator would result in a sequel , The Exterminator 2 ( 1984 ) with Ginty reprising his role . The film is included in theAction Packed Marathona four film collection . The sequel has some strange aspects , but the level of violence is amplified , and the flame thrower that is a part of the Exterminator 's promotional campaign , is more prominently featured .	1
This is One of Those TRUE GUILTY PLEASURES ! ! !

This is the fifth Godzilla film and its one of the best . Its really a follow up to MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA . This is the first release , in the US , of the unedited Japanese version . For competists , the strangely reedited US version has also been included . Both versions are entertaining.This is the first time team up of Godzilla , Rodan and Mothra against the alien dragon King Ghidorah ( aka Ghidrah ) . Along for the ride are the twin faeries fromMothra 's island who , telepathically orchestrate the colaboration . There is also a amnesiac Himalayan princess who is also a cross dressing Martian prophetess ; three Blues Brothers look-alike assasins who are out tofinish her off and a tough police detective who wants to save her and his sister who wants to restore her memory . Basically , it tries to play like a Hitchcock thriller or an early Bond film . In the end the espianage plotand the monster plot come together . This is the first time that Godzilla swithches from menace to hero.The first half of the film is basically `` GODZILLA VS. RODAN '' , with the two `` bad '' monsters convinced to `` turn good '' by the intelligent and telepathic Mothra . The following film MONSTER ZERO is basically a direct sequel to this with Godzilla and Rodan reteaming to fight Ghidorah in the futuristic ( at the time at least ) 1980s.These are the GODZILLA titles not yet available on DVD , and that have no current release dates : GODZILLA VS.

Even if your a casual Monster movie fan , this is among the best you will find . The Masterwork packaging is great ad the remastered prints bring Honda 's creations to life . For a classic it is also a bargain not to be passed up .	1
I am a big godzilla fan and I saw this movie as a kid . It 's about a huge , three headed monster coming to destroy earth . And it 's up to baby Mothra to convince godzilla and rodan to stop fighting each other and join mothra to defeat the 3 headed monster that the earth phrophecies said would arrive to destroy the earth . I liked this movie ! It 's a lot of fun to see Godzilla , rodan and mothra baby team up to defeat it . If you are a godzilla or monster movie fan give this movie a try.much recommended !	1
The original Japanese theatrical release is in pristine condition however Classic Media/Toho studios should have also cleaned up and remastered the American English dubbed version . That was annoying as one who would prefer to watch the American version and not have to concentrate on reading subtitles is distracted by the the uncleaned film print presented.The dvd also offers a couple of extra features which consist of stills of the monsters that star in the film and a biography ( forgotten who ) .Stills include text and other film appearances of the monsters-with title and year given .	1
Excellent packaging , well thought out menu , good commentary and extras.The price point is the major selling point for me . Not my favorite Gojira flick , but the fact that its in my collection makes me happy .	1
Great Godzilla movie and loads fun , and not only because of the monster battles . It starts out ( After the credits ) on top of a building with a bunch of people looking for flying saucers . ( These people NEED to get a life ) . One of the stars in the movie , a reporter , is blamed for the saucerpeople not coming , and a proffessor says `` I ca n't help but think that terrible things are about to happen . '' DUH . After that intillectual thought , a woman screams that she saw a UFO , but turns out only to be a meteorite . And then the scene switches to the star of the movie , a policeman talking to a reporter about Enciphilitis breaking out because of the heat wave that that 's going on in January . The reporter looks out into the sky and sees the meteorite that will give Earth a few problems . Stay tuned for more details . The reporter leaves and the dude 's boss comes in and tells the guy to guard a european princess , Salina Salno , who is being sent to Japan because of an assination plot to kill her . Then the scenes switches to the Princess being hypnotised by an alien in a flying saucer to get off the plane , and the plane blows , up and a proffessor goes to find the meteorite , that fell , and will later find out that it holds Ghidrah . Later , the policeman finds the princess ands she 's a martian from Venus . While this is happening , the assasinators are sent to kill the princess , this goes on for a while so I wo n't go to deep into it , and while THIS is happening , Rodan and Godzilla appear and start wrecking the place . And Ghidrah hatches from the meteorite and starts doing the same as Godzilla . The fairies from Godzilla x Mothra come in and call Mothra , ( one of the babies died ) and she finds Godzilla and Rodan fighting each other , shoots them with her silk and tries to convince them to fight against Ghidrah . They do n't want to , so Mothra goes and fights Ghidrah herself , and Godzilla appears as well as Rodan and the three start attacking Ghidrah together . Meanwhile The princess 's memory has restored itself and the assasinators have been killed . Meanwhile , Ghidrah is being wrapped up in silk and Godzilla tosses him of the hill , and Ghidrah flies away , humiliated . It 's a great movie and great collection to any monster series .	1
This is such a good miniseries . Great acting with great British actors ... ..great storyline . Highly recommended .	1
I had read the book years ago and now got to see it with Daniel Craig -- really liked it and helped , me to rememvber the story	1
First major role for Daniel Craig and a great start to his career . Good mysterious who-done-it with lots of great characters and interesting plot .	1
`` The Ice House '' is a surprising good television murder mystery from the BBC . It features very solid performances by Corin Redgrave and a young Daniel Craig as Inspector Walsh and Detective Sergeant McLoughlin , assigned to investigate the mystery of a dead body found in a disused ice house at Streech Grange . The Grange is inhabited by a Mrs. Maybury , whose husband mysteriously went missing nine years previously . Inspector Walsh immediately suspects the body is that the missing David Maybury , whom he further suspects was murdered by his wife.However , nothing in this three hour crime drama is simple . Not the identifying of the body , nor the cause of death , nor how it came to be in the icehouse , nor especially , who done it . The movie , based on a novel by Minette Walters , manages to make a suspect out of practically the entire cast , including the nearby villagers . The solution will be a while in coming , and may surprise all but the most acute viewers . Along the way , Daniel Craig is quietly compelling as a dutiful Scottish cop with a dying marriage , an alcohol problem , and an unexpected attraction to one of the suspects . Recommended as an entertaining mystery movie .	1
Less a mystery , more a study of human nature ( everyone has a hidden agenda ) . In this case , the police are decidedly suspicious before the facts . A body is found and Chief Inspector Walsh ( Corin Redgrave ) desperately wants it to be a man who went missing ( he presumes dead ) years ago . He goes to great lengths to ensure that everyone else jumps to the same conclusion , becoming increasingly prickly when the facts decide otherwise . Daniel Craig plays Sergeant McLoughlin , who eventually learns the inconvenient truth.There are no sympathetic characters to be found as everyone is on their worse behavior . I found it fascinating ; it certainly kept my attention throughout . I was , however , disappointed at the resolution and would never bother watching it again because of that .	1
Daniel Craig 's acting is outstanding ! Watch him in 007 's 50th year movie , too . Daniel Craig really put his heart , soul , and tremendous acting talents into this movie ! !	1
If you do n't like British TV ; this could change your mind.Do n't be looking for 007 ; this is Inspector McLoughlin.I could have did without the TV break between parts .	1
OH MY GOSH ! ! ! What a fabulous movie . Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot ! I must say , the Brits know how to write a mystery . There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo ! Nothing is as it seems . No one is as they seem . Who is the body in the ice house ? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again , or is it a sick coincidence ? It 's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled . How long has he been dead ? Who is he ? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage ? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the & # 34 ; Ice House. & # 34 ; Watch if you like procedural police shows , mysteries , British mysteries , and especially if you love Daniel Craig . YUMMY !	1
I really rejoyed this movie . The acting was outstanding and the movie had a bit of everything . It had supense , drama , love and the subject was great . I would highly recommend this movie .	1
The Woman in White 2014 release , 1997 vintage , 116min , and integrating to the end.Wilkie Collins Victorian mystery . Half-sister nieces of Limmeridge owner Mr Fairlie ( Ian Richardson -Becoming Jane ) unravel a conspiracy that includes a mysterious lady in white gown & veil . Fairlie hires art tutor Hartright ( Andrew Lincoln -Love Actually ) for the girls , Laura and Marian . Justine Waddel ( Wives and Daughters ) plays Laura well in her first acting role . Tara Fitzgerald ( Jane Eyre '06 ) is Marian . Sinister encounters , crime , secrets , and nightmares prevail through the summertime of young passions . All the while the insane illusive Woman in White comes and goes , day and night , but from where no one knows . Delightful film period perfection , down to the fine English houses , and a story with a surprise twist that was unexpected to me.SDH SUBTITLES are available on the 2014 release.Also available in the DVD set : Costume Drama Collection	1
There is no one better than Woody to portray a schmuck . This poor shlep could not do anything right no matter what . I love Ms. Margolin and her untimely demise is heart breaking . That last scene when he asked `` Do you know if it 's raining '' classic Woody .	1
This is one of the funniest Woody Allen films . I do n't know why it was released in full screen and that is why I deduct one star . One of Woody 's less complex comedies , but still one of my favorites . The DVD transfer looks good , but a widescreen version should have been included .	1
Since I first viewed this gem in the late 70s on TV , I have never been the same . After countless viewings , the film still manages to crack me up . Woody was at his all time best with this , his directorial debut . Fantastic satire of prison/crime films done in a part & quot ; drama & quot ; , part mock biography- style . If you have never seen this : WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ? A 100 % laugh riot .	1
Woody definitely hit the comedy goldmine here with the story of Virgil Starkwell , World 's Most Incompetent Criminal ! Done in a Prison/Heist movie meets Documentary style , Woody Allen and his inspired cast take you for a hilarious ride through the underworld with one hilarious mishap after another coming at you at machine gun pace . Punctuated by a great Marvin Hamlisch score and the authoritative yet clipped over-serious narration of the late Jackson Beck underlining the most absurd and hilarious moments , this is one movie that you just can not tear yourself away from or stop laughing at and with.Thrill and howl as you witness Virgil 's cello virtuosity ( LOL ) in a marching band , his attempt to escape a chain gang that results in his imprisonment with an insurance salesman and his attempts at raising a family while on the run.A comedy classic if ever there was ! The Best of THE EARLY FUNNY ONES !	1
This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made . When I first seen it was a Woody Allen movie , I did n't have high expectations . I decided to sit through it anyways . And , to my surprise I actually laughed through most of the entire movie . The documentary type style was the greatest idea . If you love irony this is a great movie to see . Heck , if you love to laugh this is a great movie to see . I give this one a big stamp of approval and I do n't do that for many movies	1
Although perhaps not my favourite film version of the novel ( and given the fact Wuthering Heights is a very , very difficult novel to film ) , this is a great adaptation of a phenomenal book . Some of the casting is questionable , but some characters were perfectly cast ( eg , Sara Smart as Cathy Linton is exceptionally talented ! ) . The symbolism of the windows was represented quite well and with subtlety . It would have been nice if , instead of making up their own scenes , they had filmed more scenes directly from the novel , but overall , this was a great adaptation of the novel with some wonderful imagery .	1
I find that this 1998 Masterpiece theater TV version follows the novel of the same name pretty faithfully . One who has never read the novel may find the action moving too quickly , so that the flow of the movie may seem slightly abrupt or choppy . However , the movie is only 2 hours long , which is probably why they had to cut out parts of the book and take some liberties with ages and certain details . That does not detract too much from the enjoyment of this movie , which despite its choppiness , has excellent acting , beautiful cinematography ( the landscapes are breathtaking ) , and a wonderfully wrought out , bitter plot which focuses on three generations of two families who are intimately interlocked with each other . Heathcliff definitely comes off as the cruel , embittered man he is in the book , and it 's great to see a TV movie capture the personalities of all the characters so well . Highly recommended movie and I 'm so glad it 's finally out on DVD , though I find the quality is hardly digital quality . But DVD is still a more enduring format than VHS and will most likely last longer .	1
That is the ONLY reason I bought this movie..The story was ok , but just short amount of Matthew facetime makes it worth it !	1
Although it may not have been the BEST ending to this otherwise fascinating look at the humanity of war . Nonetheless this is a very enjoyable and intriging look at an awkward turn of events for two enemies forced to confront their foe on solitary terms . The ending was war itself . Irony . Tragedy . Ending .	1
Two soldiers , one American , one Japanese , trapped together alone on a small Pacific island during WWII . What will happen ? Very interesting character study with irrational and inventive clashes , and forced compromises , with superbly acting and nice cinematography . Up until very near the end I really liked it , but unfortunately I found the climax very open-ended and weak . Too bad , it was a great story with no real ending . But with images and performances so memorable . Thumbs up .	1
This film seems to be a British classic that give rise to a famous BBC series . I liked it as being a realistic film about the life of a British country vet in pre-WWII Great Britain.The acting is first rate and the script is well done.I think that the novel may have been just as goodto have been so well represented here .	1
The acting is a tad stiff , the dialog likewise , and I 've seen better battle scenes . Even the storyline is fairly predictable in its development . So why four stars ? For the period and the overall feel . Not too many stories out there regarding the 30 Years War and the general confusion and anarchy . Costumes , scenery , etc . carry off the illusion of the period very nicely . If you let yourself flow into the movie , this can be very enjoyable , entertaining , and even educational .	1
I first saw this on PBS 's Mystery series a couple of years ago and loved it . I was able to tape two of the episodes on a repeat , but I 'm holding out hope ( most likely in vain ) for a DVD release . And Diana Rigg 's introductions on the Mystery version add lots of background and period information about some of the real people some of the characters resemble . I assume that this comentary is not included on the VHS release ( ? ) .Police Superintendent Albert Tyburn has left England and Scotland Yard for the East African colony of Kenya . He left under a cloud and rumours about why have followed him all the way to Nairobi . He 's to head up the newly created Criminal Investigations unit that pompous snob and windbag Police Commissioner Burkitt feels is entirely unnecessary . For Tyburn , `` crime is crime '' and people are people and his determination to treat the natives with respect along with his refusal to show his `` betters '' proper deference is a continual irritant to his often lofty suspects . He 's also constantly irritating his superior , Burkitt who loathes Tyburn and tells him `` you 're not one of us and you never will be '' - for which Tyburn is eternally grateful ! Trevor Eve is fantastic as Tyburn - smart , sexy , wry and sardonic he has no qualms about being unpopular as long as the criminals pay.Then there 's aviatrix Emma Fitzgerald ( played by the terrific Susannah Harker ) an independent woman on the fringe of `` polite society '' who pilots her own plane for safaris and supply runs . She and Tyburn meet when her sister is murdered in episode one . Their mutual respect and friendship evolves into one of the most understated ( but sweet ) romances I 've ever seen ! Great , tight stories , an authentic period atmosphere and wonderful supporting characters in Dr Mueller , Inspector Valentine , Corporal Karendi , Governor Rex Willoughby , decadent party-boy Chico DeVille and the sleazy and villainous Max Van der Vuerst all add up to intelligent and enjoyable viewing . Highly recommended !	1
This is a fine film , filled with good acting , directing , and photography . The writing is passable ; the plots are complex and often difficult to follow , and the political correctness is hard to swallow . `` Heat of the Sun '' is not among the great British detective films ( Gently , Frost , Morse/Lewis , Foyle ) , but it is consistently entertaining and worth your time . Especially if you like happy endings . Eve and Harker really click.The problem with the series is the packaging . The box , after listing the stars , tells you only that there are three films in the series . Each disc lists the titles on the spine of its jacket . Left unsaid is the fact that you ca n't fast forward anything . Well , you can but you ca n't get back to normal speed . The purpose of this is to force you to watch commercials , silly teasers , and repetitive and zombie-like introductions by Masterpiece Theater hostess Diana Rigg . Worse , no one tells you that each story is divided into two parts on each disc . And there is no way to reach the second half without slowly going through everything that precedes it ! And we give our tax dollars to PBS ! A beast without a head .	1
Excellant series . Wonderfully written . Trevor Eve is an enjoyable character and is fleshed out . I recommend this series . You will enjoy it .	1
I also found & quot ; Heat of the Sun & quot ; exciting , literate , and found myself only wanting more . I do hope there will be more episodes . And I hope they will also return Daniel Betts who played the Viscount in the first episode . After also seeing him on the American mini-series & quot ; The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns , & quot ; I 'm convinced he is a talent worth watching , and predict big things for him .	1
You have to give Marlo Thomas , daughter of television legend Danny Thomas ( `` Make Room for Daddy '' ) , for starting a definite trend in situation comedies with `` That Girl , '' which aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971 ; a lot of us remember the show from when ABC showed reruns during the day from 1969 to 1972 ) . In the wake of `` That Girl '' came other comedies about Independent Women such as `` The Doris Day Show , '' `` The Mary Tyler Moore Show , '' and `` Rhoda . '' Marlo Thomas played Ann Marie , a perky young actress who left the home of her father ( Lew Parker ) and mother ( Rosemary DeCamp ) in Brewster , New York , to make it on her own in New York City . Since all she could find where roles in television commercials and small parts in plays here and there , she had to support herself with a lot of odd jobs around town . This provided ample opportunity for new venues for comic encounters between new characters and `` That Girl . '' Along for the ride was Donald Hollinger ( Ted Bessell ) , a junior executive at `` Newsview '' magazine who spent all five seasons trying to get `` That Girl '' down the aisle.This first DVD gives us nine choice episodes from the show 's entire run : ( 1 ) The pilot episode `` Do n't Just Do Something , Stand There '' ( September 8 , 1966 ) begins our saga as Ann is working as a candy clerk and meets Donald . When he sees her again she is doing a perfume commercial where she gets kidnapped by two robbers . Donald thinks this is real and comes to her rescue with predictable results . ( 2 ) `` Anatomy of a Blunder '' ( Episode 5 , October 6 , 1966 ) , has Ann bringing Donald home to meet her parents but making the mistake of stopping for a nice little picnic along the way . ( 3 ) `` Counter Proposal '' ( Episode 113 , Season premier for Season 5 , September 25 , 1970 ) completes the informal `` Donald Trilogy '' that opens this disc with the moment when Donald finally asks Ann to marry him . That is the good news ; the bad news is that his co-worker Bob Howard ( Ronnie Schell ) talks Donald into buying an engagement ring second hand from Mr. Franklin ( Avery Schreiber ) . Note : This is the first episode to feature lyrics for the `` That Girl '' theme song . ( 4 ) `` Call of the Wild '' ( Episode 50 , January 25 , 1968 ) has Ann insulted when she is hired to be the Creamy Soap Girl because the producer ( Jesse White ) sees her as having the sort of face that will not make housewives jealous . Consequently , Ann is convinced she has no sex appeal , and that is not something for `` That Girl '' to take without a fight . ( 5 ) `` Nobody Here But Us Chickens '' ( Episode 90 , October 9 , 1969 ) continues the bad commercial gigs as Ann is hired by Major Culpepper ( Slim Pickens ) to be the Dancing Chicken for his friend chicken chain . When the Major tries to hit on her in his car , Ann hits the road ( guess how she is dressed ) . ( 6 ) `` The Snow Must Go On '' ( Episode 93 , October 30 , 1969 ) finds Ann and Donald stuck with her parents at Kennedy Airport during a blizzard . Of course Ann has a Broadway audition to go to and nothing short of complete and total disaster will stop her . ( 7 ) `` This Little Piggy Had a Ball '' ( Episode 28 , March 23 , 1967 ) , has Ann enduring one the peculiar tribulations of sit com stars , getting something stuck in something at the wrong time . Just cross Lucy 's bowling ball with Laura Petrie 's toe , and you get the idea . Rob Reiner plays Carl and Teri Garr is Estelle in this episode . ( 8 ) `` Pass the Potatoes , Ethel Merman '' ( Episode 31 , season premier for 2nd season , September 7,1 967 ) has the legendary Broadway star herself picking Ann for a walk on role in `` Gypsy . '' You know this sounded like a good idea at the time . Merman would return later that season and become `` The Other Woman '' for Ann 's father . ( 9 ) `` Those Friars '' ( Episode 127 , January 8 , 1971 ) features not only Danny Thomas but also `` Mr. Television '' himself , Milton Berle as guest stars . Strangely enough , the two television legends play themselves . It seems that Ann 's uncle , an old vaudevillian has died , and the two pop out to try and buy the old trunk left to her in Uncle Harry 's will.I am not particularly enamored of the `` That Girl '' television series and its ability to end each and every teaser with the title phrase , but whoever selected these nine episodes did a pretty good job . There is no special `` wedding '' episode of the series because Donald only got as far as a stage party ( plus Thomas did not want to send the wrong message to young women by making that the end of the series ) , but these episodes are certainly representative of what this show was about . You also have an impressive set of guest stars and it was a nice touch saving daddy for the last one . Yes , your favorite might not be included in these nine episodes -- mine was `` I Ai n't Got Nobody , '' when Ann 's face was put on someone else 's body in the centerfold of `` Playpen '' magazine -- but there is not a bad episode in this bunch .	1
Beautiful transfers on these episodes ! The DVD is perfect in every way . Love the photos on the packaging , just wish they would have used the original THAT GIRL logo and lettering instead of the non-related logo used . A very small complaint for a perfect job by ANCHOR BAY ! If you like the show ... you will love these episodes . Hope the second video set comes out on DVD too ! Keep going with the series as IMAGE is doing with I SPY ! Also , love the Marlo promo at the end of the first episode aired . Would love to see more extras like that ... promos , etc . I know a few collectors that have some if you need them . GREAT JOB ! Rick	1
Before he was The Phantom of the Opera , he was Woody ( better known as Condorman ) and before Barbara Carrera was Fatima Blush [ 007 's Never Say Never ( Again ) ] , Barbara Carrera was Woody 's love interest , Natalia -- she was a looker back then . Condorman really did protect us from those Commies !	1
I have not been able to purchase this movie yet . I rented the movie to watch since I grew up with it . I absolutely love the movie and wish I could find it for a cheaper price . I hope it will be released on Blu-ray . Will rent again if still available sometime .	1
I remember watching an interview a few years back like `` This is your life '' with Michael Crawford , and they went through his career of TV , movies and plays etc.. and I kept waiting for them to mention Condorman , but they never did : ( and they should , as it 's a very underrated movie.When I was a kid , this was one of my favorite movies . About Woody ( Crawford ) who is a comic book writer who 's best friend Harry ( Michael J Fox 's father in Teen Wolf/Longest Yard ( original ) guy who dies ) is a file clerk for a spy company , who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers , he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent ( Natalia ) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.Woody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia 's boss/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape , in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.Seeing this again many years later , I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action/adventure comedy . But , it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days , and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.The character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart , a bumbling secret agent who does n't always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys , but by unintentional luck , but gets the girl in the end . Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time , and that is about what Condorman is.A lot of humor , zany antics , car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.Ignore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks ... they are ripping you off hard . The DVD quality is not that great , it kind of looks like it was done straight from an old VHS to DVD without bothering to clean it up . And there is no bonus features . This DVD deserves more respect then this , and I hope Disney decide to do a special edition of it someday.Oh yeah , not to forget , the second hand sellers are selling the out of print region 1 version ... the DVD is still in print in region 4 for about 10 bucks , and includes another film with it too . And do n't worry about the region stuff , they play in any old computers DVD player . So I 'd recommend doing the smart thing and finding the ones still in print and pay a whole heap less then these clowns prices.and to the person who is selling it for 500 bucks , BWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH , you have a b grade movie there , not the holey grail .	1
I really enjoyed this movie this is a fun movie this movie so fun that this movie makes you feel like you are right along with the actors and would like to be with them ! ! ! ! This movie is about different groups in colors : green , red , blue , white , and yellow . It is a group that includes a pair of twins they are so funny ! ! ! ! ! It is a must have for any Michael J . Fox fan he is in this movie he is a whiz at playing video games and he helps his brother 's team and he joins the team this is basically a movie about different teams going on a scavenger hunt it is so good funny and interesting I would really reccommend anyone who likes movies of the 1980 's to purchase this video ! ! ! !	1
Just wanted to tell everyone that if they think the ( WS ) in the title means that this is Widescreen , they 'll be upset.Anchor Bay DID release this on DVD before Disney did ( as well as Condorman , North Ave. Irregulars , and Candleshoe ) , but Anchor Bay 's release was full screen , and so is Disney's.As of this date ( 8/6/2010 ) , there never has been a widescreen version of this released in any form , in any country . So do n't get your hopes up.I think it 's a pretty darn funny movie , by the way .	1
There may be a lot of people who 've never heard of `` Midnight Madness , '' but it 's worth a watch . It has even inspired a HUGE scavenger hunt in New York City . It 's also the big screen debut of one Michael J. Fox.There are far too many movies that work so hard to be serious or dramatic or action-packed . This movie is simply silly and fun . Is it predictable ? Maybe . But it 's fun to watch things unfold . Are there problems with the script ? Maybe . But , on the whole , it works as a family movie & my son really enjoyed it . ( It even got us thinking about a scavenger hunt of our own ! ) Btw ... if you still remember Kaptain Kool and the Kongs you may recognize a familiar face in Debra Clinger . Do you remember `` I 'm a pepper , he 's a pepper ... would n't you like to be a pepper too ? '' Does `` An American Werewolf in London '' ring any bells ? Then you 'll recognize David Naughton immediately . There were n't a whole lot of fellas back then as cute as he . There a few more familiar faces in this movie as well . Take a look !	1
When I very first watched this movie , I hated it ! I thought it was too long and boring . Sometime later , I watched it again and I loved it ! Leon created the Great All-Nighter and picked five college students to pick teams and go on a scavenger hunt throughout the town to find clues that will lead them to the finish line . This has the classic look of the 80 's ! It 's also Michael J . Fox 's first movie ! I highly recommend MIDNIGHT MADNESS ! ! !	1
Geez , I ca n't believe there are people who know this movie better than I do ? ! ? ! I 'm honored to have read all your reviews . I have n't laughed so hard in quite a while ! What can I say about this movie that you all have n't said so eloquently already ? Well , I never saw this on HBO , ever , and we had HBO in the 80s when I was growing up . Where the hell was I ? ? ? I first saw this movie in 1987 , a few days before I started college in Sacramento , CA . I knew it was bad right from the beginning , but they had so much fun that I began to hope that 's what college would be like for me . That lasted one day . But my love for this movie continues , and I have this weird feeling of comraderie with all of you who already know why this is more than just a guilty pleasure . They really do n't make movies like this anymore , a fact that only enhances my enjoyment for this film , and others like it ( such as 'Scavenger Hunt ' ) . The world that these characters inhabit is oddly attractive to me : cornball , cheesy , dumb , and yet innocent , fun , friendly , and full of adventure . Meelio is the funniest single thing about this movie . Even if I 'm in a bad mood and am not laughing at the rest of the movie , he still makes me laugh . I realized I had forgotten how many great lines are in this movie . Three tidbits for the fans : 1-I know exactly where the Johnnie 's Fatboy Burger is in LA . Having gone to elementary school there , and spent 2000-2004 there as well , I know the area well . At the corner of Wilshire ( just like what's-his-name in the movie says ) and Fairfax is an abandoned burger joint called Johnnie Rocket 's . The parking lot is the very same way ( when I last saw it it 2004 ) it was when they filmed the movie . Also , the guy who played 'Blade ' is still acting and living in LA . I saw him at my work in 2001 . I wanted to tell someone I just saw 'Blade ' from 'Midnight Madness ' , but I knew that no one would know what I meant . Lastly , even though he looks 12 years old , Michael J . Fox turned 19 the year this movie was released . Thanks to all of you who let me know that I 'm not the only one on earth who likes movies like this ! ! !	1
The movie starts a little slow but if you hang in there you 'll laugh untill your sides hurt . Very clean family movie .	1
This movie was received earlier than the ship date ! ! Really great movie in the DVD format rather than the VHS.Really loved the actors & actresses . It was nice , also to see how good triumphs over evil in a humorous and action filled way.Thank you Amaazon & vendor for giving me an enjoyable time with this movie .	1
This is one of the typical old Walt Disney Movies you love . When my Grandkids watched this they laughed and laughed . They really enjoyed it as much as we did .	1
I rented this movie the other nite and ca n't stop watching it ! It 's about a group of church ladies who try to get gambling out of their town the fact that they have no clue what they are doing makes it hilarious ! A couple of the funniest parts are when Barbara Harris is in the grocery store buying tons of cheerios and pretending not watch the crooks ; another very funny part is at the end and they are in `` demo deby '' and the one lady breaks her nails . A good family movie worth watching .	1
Cloris Leachman at one of her best roles . If church was this good I would not have a problem attending . Lively music , Short Sermons you do n't have time to sleep through , and so much more . This film is one of the best kept secrets that Disney ever put out . I saw it when it first came out - loved it then and still love it . I am so happy I was able to find it here . I even bought copies for Christmas and gave as gifts .	1
Yet another classic from Dario Argento 's golden period.This is one of my favourites - a mesmerising blend of stunning camerawork , imagery and music that leaves one breathless by the incredible end.A must see .	1
This film has everything . Murder/mystery/horror/gore/suspense/chills and everything else.The communication with bugs was different , but the killer at the end was quite strange.This is a wonderful dvd that is clean , clear and the Goblin music in here is awsome . Suspiria was my top Argento flick , but Phenomena has alot more going for it . If you do n't mind foreign horror flicks , then this one is a must buy ! !	1
I 'm a big Dario Argento fan particularly of his output starting with `` Bird with a Crystal Plumage '' up through the ferocious 1987 film `` Opera '' . While his films after `` Opera '' in my eyes saw a increasingly depressing drop in quality that unfortunately continues to this day , those films from BWTCP up through and including Opera are all great films that are just stunning to watch purely from a craft & filmmaking standpoint . `` Phenomena '' was released in 1985 to lukewarm reviews as the film was just so out there from a purely stylistic standpoint that many people did n't quite know to make of it . It also did n't help that in America almost an entire half hour was cut out of the film for its release under the alternate title `` Creepers '' . You had a 13 year old Jennifer Connelly who could communicate with insects , Donald Pleasance with a pet monkey that was also his helper and a dwarf killer running around murdering young girls at an all girl school in Switzerland where the film is set to name a few of the delightful oddities that make this film so much fun . I ca n't neglect to mention the heavy metal soundtrack that plays along with most of the murder scenes too . The film is also puncuated with his trademark over-the-top graphic violence throughout . While I do n't think it 's Dario 's best film , it is my personal favorite movie of his that I come back to the most.Prior to this blu ray release , Anchor Bay had released the 110 minute Europeran cut of the film first in non-anamorphic widescreen DVD and then with a new anamorphic transfer that also preserved the film 's original 1.66:1 theatrical aspect ratio . What some people did n't realize at the time was that there was still a longer Italian cut that was close to 116 minutes in length . For the film 's blu ray release , Arrow Video decided to release the full 116 minute Italian cut . Since English dialogue had n't been recorded for these additional scenes , the film occasionally switches back to the Italian language track with English subtitles similar to what Anchor Bay had to do with their DVD/blu-ray of Dario 's classic film `` Deep Red '' . It 's not nearly as as jarring as it sounds.A lot of people have taken Arrow Video to task for their transfers used on their blu-rays of Argento 's amazing 1982 film `` Tenebrae '' and some of Lucio Fulci 's great horror titles . There was also complaints about the transfer of Phenomena too . I find all of these complaints hogwash for the most part because even with the blu-ray 's imperfections visually , it still blows the old DVD 's away without even trying.The complaint about Phenomena is that digital noise reduction was used to erase some of the film grain which gives the film a cleaner look than people would like . The DNR is n't overdone though and the cast never begin to have any waxy looks like when DNR is used egregiously like the ultimate hunter edition of Predator or Fox 's initial blu-ray of Patton . Would I preferred for all of the film grain to have been left in , most certainly . But there is still a ton of detail that is a massive leap both over the older DVD 's and the colors really pop in a way that it 's truly like seeing the film again for the first time . The difference between this blu ray and the older Anchor Bay DVD is truly like night and day.The sound is presented in two channel stereo which sounds fine . Cool extras include a 52 minute making of featurette , a little over 6 minute discsussion on the original music by Cladio Simonetti and an almost 19 minute Q & A ; with Sergio Stivaletti discussing the film 's creature and gore effects . None of the extras from the Anchor Bay DVD have been carried over including the commentary track so completists will want to hang onto that old DVD.The blu-ray is region free NTSC format including all of the extras so it plays perfectly in all US blu ray players . This is well worth picking up for fans of this criminally underrated film and a great upgrade that all fans should enjoy greatly .	1
PHENOMENA ( Italy - 1984 ) Aspect ratio : 1.66:1Theatrical soundtrack : Dolby StereoOriginally edited for US consumption and released under the title CREEPERS , the full-length version of Dario Argento 's masterwork reveals the method in his madness . Whereas the edited version was a fast-moving collage of half-baked themes which evoked nothing of any significance , PHENOMENA reinstates the crazy-quilt pacing , whereby dream-like passages surrender abruptly to episodes of screaming hysteria , all of which is essential to any appreciation of the film 's dark ambitions.Romano Albani 's sumptuous cinematography transforms the breathtaking Swiss locations into a fairy-tale landscape where monstrous eruptions of violence disturb the illusion of tranquility , and Jennifer Connelly drifts through the narrative in a state of near-hypnotic grace , allowing herself to become ensnared by the machinations of a deformed killer and his/her equally psychotic 'guardian ' . True , the longer version is bogged down at times by lengthy dialogue scenes which hold up the plot , and the involvement of Donald Pleasence 's chimp is no less misguided than before ( its final act of retribution crosses the line into absurdity ) , but the set-pieces are magnificently realised , and the final 20 minutes are as hair-raising as anything in Argento 's ouevre .	1
Many Argento fans do n't include this in their list of favorites , but is classic Argento .	1
A few months back , I saw my first Dario Argento film , Suspiria , a creepy little thriller that looked great , sounded great and had a flawed but passable story . Phenomena , my second exposure to Argento , has similar qualities but is a slightly inferior movie.Like Suspiria , this movie focuses on an American female who is sent to an eerie boarding school in Central Europe . In this case , Jennifer Connelly ( in one of her earliest starring roles ) plays Jennifer , the teenaged daughter of a wealthy but completely absent father who has sent her off to a Swiss boarding school . Jennifer has a psychic affinity with insects which help provide her clues about a local serial killer.Donald Pleasance is a wheelchair-bound scientist who befriends Jennifer and assists her in investigating the killer . Fortunately , the killer likes to keep parts of the bodies , attracting flies which help Jennifer.Although the acting and writing is not very good ( Connelly is still a good decade away from her Oscar caliber work ) , the movie makes up for it with the direction , settings and soundtrack by Goblin ( who were even more effective in Suspiria ) and various other musicians such as Iron Maiden and Bill Wyman . If you do n't like bugs ; this is n't the movie for you ; in particular , this is one of the most maggot-filled movies ever . Otherwise , this is an effective - if minor - horror movie that merits watching .	1
This and Labyrinth came out in the same year , making it Jennifer Connelly 's debut on the big screen . In this tale of terror , a serial killer is haunting a boarding school . Jennifer Connelly has a unique talent , in that she can communicate with , and control , bugs . Bugs of all kinds , every shape and size . This helps greatly when the killer confronts her , but is that the whole story ?	1
Argento 's loose again , and he 's doing the whole unknown killer knocking off women thing . But , he must have had some of Inferno and Suspiria clinging to him , coz we have a little bit of that supernatural weirdness mixed in with this film . It plays out like a merging of his two film styles . The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly is the lead , but this is no Labyrinth . She 's got some nasty stuff to deal with here . Aside from being a sleuth with insect pals , she has to deal with being a & quot ; freak & quot ; at her school , classmates with Bee Gee shirts , dead girls popping up everywhere , a chimpanzee wielding a razor , poison pills , puking , maggot pools , a mutant kid , and a very long telephone cord . Plus , a film that plays Iron Maiden 's & quot ; Flash Of The Blade & quot ; in almost all of it 's entirety ca n't be all that bad . Donald Pleasance is here too ! Who does n't love that guy ? So grab this sucker before it disappears from the shelves . After all , you 're not a communist , are you ?	1
This great 80s flick with Jennifer Connelly is a nice piece of work by Argento , with good locations , awesome soundtrack , and a bizarre and fascinating story featuring a girl who communicates with insects , which lead her to dead bodies and the discovery of a serial killer .	1
Why does Anthony F. put his luggage down in the middle of nowhere while he takes a phone call ? Eh . Whatever I thought it was a sylish masterwork nonetheless .	1
After having seen this , I 'll definitely watch more movies made by Dario Argento . It 's not your average cup of blood and gore ; if anything , this whole movie is done with style -- artistic.I really ca n't compare this to & quot ; normal & quot ; Horror , as I just do n't watch that often -- simple entertainment is not suitable for me.On the whole this 'perversity ' was interesting , but made more so because of a number of extremely provoking images . Of course I ca n't tell you which ... would spoil the fun somewhat { do n't want to get murdered for that } .NOT predictable.Great ending.That dog chase was nice ! Dog chasing woman , that is . That happened to me one day , and I tell you , you do n't want that to happen to you -- no , I did not hurt the dog , it just charged.Acting is okay -- did not pain my eyes.Pay attention to technical information ; read the other reviews.Best of luck .	1
After many years and after doing only supernatural movies ( SUSPIRIA , INFERNO ) Dario Argento returned to the genre that made him famous , the italian giallo genre . This was a well recieved film when it came out . And instead of using the dark cinematography he usually uses he decided to try making this film sunny and it does not lessen the impact of the film . It is about an american author named Peter Neal ( Anthony Franciosa ) who is promoting his new book TENEBRAE in Rome and while he 's there a mysterious killer ( using the black gloves that have become a recurring prop in Argento 's giallo films ) viciously murders & quot ; perverts & quot ; in the same way as in the book TENEBRAE . He murders a theif , lesbians , etc . He considers them perverts . The movie is relentlessly violent , especially towards the end and it has many plot twists . Argento relies more on narrative in this film than he usually does but it still has his same style . It again features a great score by Goblin and it also features the director 's wife , Daria Nicolodi . For the recored she has been in many of his films ( DEEP RED , INFERNO , TERROR AT THE OPERA a.k.a OPERA and PHENOMENA a.k.a CREEPERS ) . This is one of Argento 's best films and it features many famous sequences , including a crane shot that was very difficult to pull off in those days .	1
It 's good to finally see a decent copy of Tenebre ( previously only available in a severely butchered form entitled Unsane ) commercially available in the U.S.. It is a VERY violent film that may turn some people off . However , for those who like their horror wild , bloody , amd artistically directed , this is the film for you.The story is well constructed and easily involves the viewer despite the fact that the visuals often overwhelm the plot details . Argento 's flair for wringing menace out of ordinary things and situations is in evidence throughout . Danger and foreboding seem to lurk in every corner , threatening to leap out at any moment.As usual , the film is a feast for the eyes and ears . The virtuoso camera work , rich colors , set designs , and excellent score by Goblin members Simonetti , Morante , and Pignatelli all work together to push this film into classic territory.See this film !	1
i love this movie but its not really a giallo but more like a slasher movie this was once banned in the uk so dont watch around grandma there are a lot of good death scenes an amazing soundtrack and beautiful ( cut ) camera angles	1
The perfect example of how a suspence film can also tie itself in to the & quot ; slasher & quot ; film genre without either watering down the gore nor dumbing down the suspence . Argento 's Tenebre is a masterfully directed film presented in this great VHS edition by Anchor Bay . With a few extras included on the VHS and with great picture and sound clarity , this uncut version of the film is a must see for those with a strong stomach . Producers and directors of such modern & quot ; suspence & quot ; films as 1999 's & quot ; The Bone Collector & quot ; and any of the & quot ; Scream & quot ; films could learn a lot from the likes of Argento . Well done !	1
First off : what 's up with the misspelled title ? It is TENEBRAE , not TENEBRE . I suppose some graphics worker was asleep at the wheel ... I bought this in lieu of the full box set because it 's easily the best film offered , and because I have the others in some form or other . TENEBRAE has no supernatural content , but is a regular giallo murder story . The difference is in the trademark Argento execution , making TENEBRAE far more entertaining than most giallos I 've seen . Fun performances by Tony Franciosa and ubiquitous John Saxon , and , need I add : plenty of blood . It 's no SUSPIRIA , but Argento fans should certainly have this DVD . It 's of the customary Anchor Bay quality , and the special material , while nothing to set the world on fire , is a nice addition .	1
This easily ranks among my top 5 from Dario Argento.This gem tells the tale of a horror author Peter Neal and his newest book , Tenebre . The book is deemed by some to be sick and sexist ( since the victims in the book are females ) . However , a homicidal fanatic is killing people in the same fashion of the book ! The movie definately has the stylish touch of Mr. Argento . Also , I found the cast to be rather superb ( John Saxon is in it , and he always gives a good performance ) . A nice surprise ending too ( though it would be somewhat copied in Stendhal Syndrome ) . Definately worth watching . Hell , buy it !	1
`` Demons '' is very similar to `` Evil Dead '' in its sense of claustrophobia and impending dread , and makes for a fun Saturday-night guilty pleasure . Entirely enjoyable , and more frightening than I remember from seeing it in the theater .	1
I rate this as one of the scariest and here 's why . Years ago , when it was new and playing at the theater I saw it and let me tell you , seeing this film in a darkened theater is one terrifying experience . Perhaps because the demons were terrorizing the victims in a theater , I do n't know , but it was beyond creepy and I still remember being scared out of mind to this day .	1
First of all , this wonderfully hellish movie is bloody bloody bloody ! I have seen this a couple of times and it just keeps on getting better and better everytime ! That one guy that gets 7 inch razor sharp demon nails buried deep within his poor ol face is very very sick ! Ouch ! There are so many great highlights in here , you just have to see this to believe it.. Great gore , excellent atmospheres , and ugly , UGLY looking demons , all of this makes up for a perfect horror movie . BUY THIS !	1
Cheesy freakin ' movie.But I love it . See this one , it 's a classic . See if you can find the 2-pack `` Demons/Demons 2 '' set like I did . You 'll love every minute of it . Italian cheese at it 's ultra-best . : )	1
I think this is a great premise for a horror movie . It consists of a great story , great gore effects , inventive camera work , and a soundtrack full of 80s rock and metal ... what more could you ask for ? The plot is straight-forward . ( unlike many Italian horror films ) and I feel that this is one of Bava 's best . If you 're a fan of Italian horror or just want to try something different , go pick up a copy of Demons . The sequel is quite good as well .	1
Although Lamberto Bava is n't quite as effective a director as his father Mario Bava , DEMONS nonetheless does entertain and contain some `` cartoonish '' but effective special effects . The gore is over the top , and one of the more memorable scenes is the mini-demon that pops out of the girl 's back.DEMONS takes place in Germany with two women meeting up . One of them , who slightly reminds me of Neve Campbell ( the hottie she is ! ) , is on a train and has a slightly disturbing experience when she is followed by a masked man , but he only wants to offer her a ticket to a free movie ( but he 's not what you think towards the end ) . They proceed to go to a cathedral-like theater where we are introduced to the other audience members ( Urbano is the man in his role ! ) who are mostly doomed to a grim fate that starts when of the ladies with Urbano 's character is scratched by a mask , ultimately leading to her turning into a hideous demon . From there , the demon plague spreads like wildfire and , in turn , many of the non-demons are left to fight against the horde of demons in the theater . The movie is downright disturbing but very campy and kinda silly , but it adds to the movie-within-a-movie premise . The ending did leave the film open , but DEMONS 2 would take the same premise in a different setting with just as gory results and some kind of neat special effects.While very derivative of its time ( Dawn of the Dead is better ) , DEMONS nonetheless is a good Italian horror film , very entertaining , sometimes scary , and downright gory . Do n't let this movie infect you ...	1
When I first viewed Demons in the late 80 's on VHS , I thought it was pretty scary and none of the styles or acting seemed out of time or place . Now , twenty years later , this movie is caught in an 80s time capsule which is actually what gives it it 's charm . Demons is more adventure and suspense with gory horror elements and plenty of goofy characters . It could be the Love Boat of gorefests ( though set in a weird Germanic theater and redhead replacing hostess Julie ) .As with most classic Italian scream fests , the colors and lighting and general style stand out over the plot . You want acting ? Forget it , between the dubbing and cartoony characters there 's nary a fine actor in sight but that 's another element that gives Demons it 's comic book/giallo charm . And , the Demons ' green vomit/drool , lit eyes and teeth replacement just enhance the overall gory effects.if you 're in the mood for stylish Euro grindhouse , this is the demonic movie within a movie for you . Maybe have some fine Italian wine and creamy green dip with it for culinary enhancement .	1
I must have seen this film originaly when i was about 7 and i loved , so when it was released on dvd i had to buy it . Upon watching it again it still had the same affect on me . The effects are no where near as good compared to todays films but compared to the films that were around at the time it was far superior . This is worth watching if you like old horrors and dont expect loads of special effects that you demand from new films	1
wow , I did n't think LION OF THE DESERT Would be released on two disc Set Including the ARABIC Version , I Still have the Old Single edition , BUT I bought two dvd Copies of this New 2 disc Set Special Edition , DO N'T mess this ONE , It deserves to be add 'd in your COLLECTION : p	1
This movie though not popular is one of the good movie I 've seen . It 's all about a man ( Mukhtar ) . who tries to save his homeland from colonization for twenty years.Anthony Quinn is incredible as Mukhtar . but I also praise Oliver Reed for potraying as Graziani the & quot ; Governer of Libya & quot ; sent by Mussolini to quell this rebellion . But there was a draw back of the film . It was a bit one sided , showing the Arabs as hero ( righttfully so ) while the Italians ( as in soldiers etc ) as ruthless and barbaric . While colonialization of other lands is wrong . I feel this film was a bit too slandorous against the Italians . But remember Mussolinni was the founder of the oppressive system of Facism.Pros : Exellent History of Libya Between the 2 World WarsBattle scenes are awesome Amazing actors ( Oliver Reed , Anthony Quinn , Rod Steiger etc ) Cons : One Sided , too biased against the ItaliansPoor sound Quality , music audio tracks takes over the action ( I have a surround systems ) But the movie was good	1
Heard about this movie on talk radio and decided to check it out . Glad I did . It is based on a true story and Anthony Quinn is a muslim leader rebelling against the Italians in there conquest of North Africa . Shown with actual news footage which enhances the movie . Statements made by Anthony Quinn after being captured really are true in todays crazy world .	1
This movie may have had reviews but I liked it fine . I thought the camera handling was good , the costumes and vehicles excellently portrayed and the action fine . The story ? Pretty good . I bit long but it keeps your interest . Certainly there is no depth to some of the characters but is it really necessary to get into Mussolini 's head ? I also loved the use of archival movie footage in this film . Some directors overdo this technique but I thought it was very well done in this movie.I was glad to get my hands on this gem . I 'm sure I 'll be watching it several times .	1
Until I watched this , I didn & # 8217 ; t know that there was a Desert Fox . I liked the acting very much and the story was pretty much the actual thing . This makes for good watching and keeps ones interest up .	1
I beg to differ with reviewer Jeff Shannon . Speaking as a person who has done some serious research into this truly inspiring ( but little known to most Westerners ) historic event , this film never ceases to entrall and amaze me : a potent mix of historic veracity , gritty realism , sincere performances from ALL it 's principal actors and ( most of all ) genuine faith in the power of Man 's ability to rise above all manner of enslavement ( both physical and spiritual ) . From start to finish , it is engrossing and soul-stirring.An interesting footnote : at the time of it 's initial release , Quinn was quoted as saying he thought it was his most accomplished performance to date ( and I could n't agree MORE ) ! Though it may ( to many Western film reviews such as Shannon ) be considered a mere `` footnote '' in film history , this in NO WAY diminishes it 's epic grandeur ; retelling a story that is well worth your time to watch-no , EXPERIENCE ! WELL WORTH checking out ! Shirley Pena	1
This Movie shows the struggle of a nation for its feedom . It shows how the will can fight a war against modern trained army . Regardless to whom had produced the movie ( because of lack of Funds ) this movie had a message to pass and I think it did . You 'll have to watch the full version for the true effect .	1
Largely forgotten among the horror movies of the 1970s , and vastly overshadowed by STAR WARS , the 1977 horror film THE CAR , despite looking and feeling dated in places , works fairly well in its narrow format the way a great many horror films do . Instead of piling on the blood and gore , like too many horror films after HALLOWEEN would do , THE CAR is more of a suspense shocker based on supernatural themes , predating the Stephen King-based CHRISTINE by six years.As has been mentioned , THE CAR is a long , black , and quite frankly evil limousine that has its sights set on the town of Santa Ynez in southwestern Utah . James Brolin is the town 's deputy sheriff who must cope with and stop this limousine before it kills any more people ( in the film 's opening sequence , it actually kills two cyclists in Zion National Park ) . What he WO N'T believe in , despite the imploring of his fellow deputy ( Ronny Cox ) , is that this car does n't have a driver but rather is possessed by a demonic force . When it chases a local schoolteacher ( Kathleen Lloyd ) into a cemetary , it wo n't barge through ( it nevertheless succeeds in killing her in her home ) . Brolin still does n't believe in it even after the film 's fiery climax.Though not necessarily blessed with originality , being as it is a combination of THE OMEN and DUEL , THE CAR nevertheless moves with velocity , thanks in large part to an ensemble cast that includes John Marley , R.G . Armstrong ( a Peckinpah regular ) , Roy Jenson , and John Rubinstein . Director Elliot Silverstein , whose credits include CAT BALLOU and A MAN CALLED HORSE , makes the most of the plot with very good special effects , including the explosive finale ; and he is helped by a good score from Leonard Rosenman ( Oscar-winner for adapting music for Kubrick 's BARRY LYNDON in 1975 ) , which incorporates the ominous Gregorian chant `` Dies Irae . `` Though not a masterpiece per se , THE CAR is nevertheless far better than some might give it credit for . It deserves a look for any horror film fan looking for something more than a standard-issue blood-and-guts slasher film .	1
I remember seeing this classic as a kid in the 1970 's , and i had loved it , so last week i ordered it to see if it could still hold up in this modern day of CGI special effects and shock-horror . It was captivating then , and it grasped my attention when i watched it today . `` The Car '' is a suspenseful little film , with quite solid acting , and an eerie atmosphere although 90 % of the action takes place in the daytime , when the vast skies are bright , blue , and clear , and the dirt , and desert cinematography are brilliant and picturesque ... maybe thats what gave me an unsettling feeling , that somewhere in this small , slow paced , quiet , desert town , something indestructible , fast , and evil appeared , in the daylight ... '' The Car '' is , in my opinion , what a good horror flick is about ; suspenseful moments , good music , acting and camera angles , and especially in which that it frightens us without the overwhelming use of purposeless shock- violence that overflows the majority of modern day horror films . Now , i really dig horror films and all genres of film , but nowadays i really look forward to being scared by atmosphere , concept , story-line , and a build up of suspense , kinda like a Steven King short story..No CGI here , no explicit gore , just conjured up notions that some possessed car is running over people , ( all we usually see is white sheets with some blood on them ) and that makes it more frightening , but we do see the car killing people ... the fact that this vehicle , which physically looks evil , is tearing through this town unmercifully . The killer in this movie is solid steel , gas and rubber , and it makes you think , that as human beings we are just mere flesh and blood , and that it 's pretty hard to fight a crazed vehicle..HaHaHaHaThere are some pretty good performances here , actors with expressive , facial expressions like James Brolin and his girlfriend , and supporting roles with Ronny Cox , and John Marley from the `` Godfather , '' plus , some really cool stunt scenes , great sound effects ... and that damned horn ! ! ! If you like atmospheric , creepy 70 's horror films , i recommend `` The Car '' ... it 's a film classic .	1
in the wake of duelhere comes a nice little horror moviesilly , yes , but most enjoyable ! By the way , the car is great looking as is the picture on this dvdenjoy as a guilty pleasure !	1
I love this movie from the first time I saw it on TV in 1977 ... From the first scene just watching The Car come from out of no where is creepy . The movie has entered cult classic status and deservidly so . The CAR is just down right scary . I 've always hoped for a remake but I 'm fairly certain I would disappointed ... .I own the Anchor Bay Platinum release of this DVD and the newer Universal release ... The Universal release has some missing sound effects which are very important to the movie but has a good picture . Both versions have widescreen and full frame options ... This movie was made nearly 35 years ago and its still very entertaining ... Let your `` this is stupid '' guard down and watch it at night.. Good scary music track too , that is vaguely familiar and always important to a scary movie ... No computer generated effects , no blood or gore . No modern special effects just some bad acting , the lame 70 's and one damn scary Car ...	1
This is a REAL thriller ! I love how the car looks and the movie is done in good taste-no blood or gore .	1
This is one of the best `` B '' movies ever ! A car driven by who knows . Good acting and great suspense ! Too bad they did n't make a sequel ! WHAT are people smokin ' to list it at this price ? ? ? What a joke ! ! ! NO movie EVER made is worth that price ! ! ! So happy I have it on VHS ( for 20 bucks ) ...	1
I ordered this DVD . I was totally satisfied with the remastering job . The image is pristine , no risks , dots , whatever The desert/mountains footage is incredibly bright and clear . A really good digital remaster , contrary to another childhood favorite of mine , HINDENBURG ( the one with George C. Scott ) .Like other reviews here , I saw this at the theaters at a very young age ( I think I was 10/12 at the time ) , and it scared me the most ! Seeing it right after I received it , I knew I would not get scared at all , but even so I enjoyed the movie a lot . Acting is well placed , special effects very good for a 1977 feature film , suspense well built , soundtrack very good . Yes , it is cheesy , but it worked wonderfully.I have for this film the same kind of affection I have for RACE WITH THE DEVIL ( the one with Peter Fonda ) .I also read the book made after the screenplay . It translates well .	1
I saw it four times in the theatre as a kid , was impressed out of my skull and have ( like many other reviewers of this movie ) bugged the local video store owner for aeons for this title to come out , and finally it did , and I bought THREE copies at one go ! I ca n't have enuff of it ! This is the best , this is the absolute best , my fave for all time ! I wan na watch it ONE more time just before I die then I 'll die in peace . Wan na see the most astonishing car-crash special effects sequence in movie history ( before they could cheat with computer graphics ) ? Wan na see better car-chase scenes than Bullit ? Wan na see an impossible and amazing stunt scene in which the Car of the title flips over , starts rolling and CRUSHES two other cars , then flip back and continue to drive on ? Want to see a possessed car like Christine but wit waaaay more class , style , cool & verve ? THIS IS IT ! Old Nick on a Sunday drive - whatta smashing ( pardon the pun ! ) premise ! The `` Car '' of the title does everything the average motorist can only fantasize about doing to other road-users , pedestrians etc . No doubt an exlpoitation movie , but WHATTA RIDE ( no pun , this ) ! Goferrit ! Now there is a diecast toy made for the Car - check out eBay ( search The Car under `` toys '' ) !	1
An edge of your seat , nail biting , thriller that will keep you attention from start to finish . It scared the heebie jeebies out of me . This will scare you ! I hated the profanity in it , But the movie itself was good . It was slow arriving , but I finally got it . It was in good shape . Box had wear , but otherwise fine .	1
This is one of my husband 's favorite movies . He had wanted it for years and it finally was released ( re-released ) for sale . Needless to say , this was one of his best Christmas gifts .	1
I LIKED THIS MOVIE AND GOT A FEW JUMPS JUST THINK AN EVIL CAR RUNNING AROUND .	1
I remember my parents let me stay up late one night to watch this movie and for three months after that , I had terrible nightmares . After all , I was only 6 years old when it came out.Now to this day , when it 's dark outside and the night is calm ... then a sudden gust of wind comes out of nowhere , I have that close-up image of that Lincoln 's grill flashing in my mind.While by today 's standards this movie would be considered a joke , the little 6 year old inside of me is still terribly thrilled that this movie is finally making its way to DVD .	1
This movie is silly ... I know . But , it 's nostalgia and excitement and memories too . Either you ca n't help but love it ... . or it is totally irrelevant to you . `` The Car '' represents `` B '' grade horror at its best with great special effects , humour , and that strange `` Jaws of the Road '' connection.Best of all ... . it is available now for purchase from Amazon Germany . New fresh prints with English/ German/ and French soundtracks.I hesitate to recommend this German edition because it will probably re-appear in the USA soon enough ; but perhaps not . There seems no rhyme or reason to some of the marketing decisions made concerning DVD releases . Personally , I have chosen to grab the new German edition while I can ... ..	1
This is a great little supernatural film and a must for fans of the 70 's TV movies or B movie suspense thrillers.Great cinematography , superb score and another EXCELLENT car designed by the George Barris , King of the Customizers and the man who brought you the General Lee , the 60 's Batmobile , the Munsters car and Starsky and Hutch 's Torino.Because the photographer makes full use of the 2:35 widescreen in all shots , this one is a must for widescreen - do n't settle for the fullframe copies that are circulating or you will definately miss one of the most redeeming aspects of this film ! ! Only mistake I saw was that they really should 've given a bigger part to the Native American Deputy as there was alot he could have added to the story.The sound of The Car when the motors running and the horn honking terror seal the deal on this well made flick . Get it on DVD now ... ... ..	1
They all come into the story of Jackson Fentry , the desperate woman he helps , and what comes of it . It 's a searching , involving film that invites reflection . Looking back , the movie seems like a poem . It brought to mind Tolkien 's `` Lord of the Rings '' ( on pity ) , and the Beatitudes . `` Tomorrow '' is so well done in so many ways that the faults I find are just nit picking . But I do wish there were subtitles ( or at least closed captions ) for us old folks.IMDb has some very interesting reviews . The DVD borrowed through my local library came complete with a copy of Faulkner 's short story , but there is also an excellent book that includes essays , conversations with people who made the film , and the full texts of story , TV play , and movie . The book is `` Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow , '' by David Yellin and Marie Connors.In the interview , Foote and Duvall are interesting as they look back together at the making of the movie . Duvall mentions an important scene that did n't make the final cut . `` Tomorrow '' is a wonderful , moving film . Viewers who do n't mind the quietness and the slow pace will treasure it.UPDATE -- GOOD NEWS ! A new Blu-ray + DVD combination is now available at a reasonable price .	1
The story is a tragedy in the purest sense . It is a tale of a humble and good man who loses the two greatest loves of his life-his wife and child . The bleakness of the ending likely kept the film from being more popular . However , it should be seen by every serious movie fan just for the performance of Robert Duvall . This great actor has never given a better performance . It left me awestruck in its simplicity and believability .	1
Our children grew up with One Magic Christmas every Christmas season . It has become a tradition to watch this heartwarming story 3-5 days before Christmas Eve .	1
This is one of our favorite Christmas movies . Had it in VHS and purchased this whe . We converted to DVD . We watch it every holiday season .	1
& quot ; One Magic Christmas & quot ; is a wonderful film for the entire family to watch during the holiday season . Its very dramatic for a Disney family film , but comes out with a happy ending . Mary Steenburgen plays a mom who has completely lost the whole Christmas spirit in her . It takes the help of her six year old daughter along with a guardian angel and Santa Claus to change her mind about Christmas . Great moments in this film portray a slight realistic approach about a family trying to cope with what they can spend on Christmas gifts . As said earlier , this movie also comes with some very dramatic moments in it . Get this film for the whole family and enjoy it for years to come ! For some odd reason , this film has been out-of-print on home video for a while , but has been made available again in 1999 on home video thanks to Anchor Bay Entertainment . Its available on standard VHS version , widescreen VHS edition , and also on the DVD format as well . Shame on the Disney company for not re-releasing this film on video , and my applauds towards Anchor Bay for doing this . & quot ; One Magic Christmas & quot ; is a Disney film and yet Disney does n't have the video rights for it or something ? I do n't understand that .	1
Have you ever thought of what the world would be like , if you had never exsisted ? This is not a miracle on 34th street . It is so different . And I just ADORE , Mary Steenburgen . She is a fantastic actress and did an incredible job in this movie as well . Her life was a mess , her husband was shot and killed , the same man stole her car with her children in it , and then the man driving way too fast on icy roads slid off a bridge into the river ... ... I wo n't spoil the rest of the story , but as she is walking down the street very depressed , all the Christmas lights went out ... . and the day started over . She was given a chance to start the day again.I highly recommnend this movie ... it would be awesome if we could all be given a chance to do just one day over ... . how our lives would change.Awesome movie ... . Get it ! ! ! !	1

With the comfort and protection of the Christmas Angel our journey is both eye opening and satisfying.A Christmas Classic to add to your DVD holiday collection.This is & quot ; ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS & quot ; you wo n't forget ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
This is a great Canadian Christmas story with lots of snow and family problems , mainly the usual money shortages . It features an unlikely angel played by Harry Dean Stanton and very young child actors who really talk like children instead of being required to read lines sounding like an adult . The cutest little girl tells the landlord , & # 34 ; My daddy says you 're a dork. & # 34 ; He is dumfounded and moves on . Later she asks her little brother , & # 34 ; What 's a dork ? & # 34 ; Then there is the one bathroom problem , which is hilarious . The angel provides the magic by enabling the little girl to go to the North Pole to see the real Santa , who really does look real , not the usual phony whiskers . All this is to get her mother to wake up to the joy of Christmas , which she does by bringing back the letter her mother wrote to Santa when she was a little girl . There is a tragedy too that I wo n't tell about , but everything becomes right in the end and the spirit of Christmas is restored .	1
I agree with others who say this is their favorite Christmas movie . It is also mine . Unfortunately , Disney has never seemed to pay much attention to it . It took quite a while for it even to be released in a widescreen version . This movie needs to add the usual extra features most movies have today . ( I 'm not even sure if they finally closed-captioned it ! It was n't originally . ) As with other movies today , I 'd like to see it brought to Blu-ray . It seems the fans of this movie think more of it than Disney does . I hope that changes . For those who have n't seen it , marking this , as so many others have , as my favorite Christmas movie stands as its own recommendation . Get with it , Disney . Give this film the care it deserves .	1
One of those depressing Christmas flicks with a happy ending , this truly family movie has a good message about remembering what is really important in life . The main character , Ginny , is caught up in her her own problems and worries . She has lost her Christmas spirit and has forgotten how important her loved ones are to her . On a cautionary note , this film is different from other movies such as & quot ; It 's a Wonderful Life & quot ; and & quot ; The Preacher 's Wife & quot ; in that the angel seems to be a representative of Santa Claus , setting up good 'ol St. Nick to be a God-like figure . When tragedy strikes the family ( not too much detail here so as not to spoil the movie if you have n't seen it yet ) the angel takes Ginny 's young daughter to Santa Claus . He tells her he ca n't solve her problem , but that her mother has the power to do it herself . The turning point in the movie left me wondering how it exactly happened , but it is a movie with a supernatural theme so this is part of the charm . Good acting by all the cast . A movie that the whole family can enjoy .	1
We stumbled across the movie several years ago and it has become a `` must watch '' every year . A touching tale about an embittered woman who has forgotten her Christmas spirit because her family has found itself unemployed and being evicted from the `` company supplied '' home . A husband and a daughter who still believe in Christmas and Santa . Visited by a Christmas angel she finds her world turned even more upside down and because of that finds her Christmas spirit ... .Fantastic , overlooked movie for the whole family . You ca n't go wrong with this one if you are looking for a new movie to add to your Christmas this year .	1
such a great story line ... .i dont know how anyone could not love this movie it teaches that family is more important than anything things in life dont matter people do . it shows kids things can happen in an instant ... great gret movie ! ! ! great meaning ! !	1
Folks , in itself this is a good film . BUT , I caution parents to take time with their young ones and affirm the STRANGER DANGER RULE . In the scene , where a six year old daughter seeks to help her mother find & quot ; magic & quot ; ; she is lured out to a strange man wearing a long coat . In this story , he 's an angel.I wish this film was rated for that purpose . I wish the angel flew around or something magical . No such luck . There are a lot of predatory perps out there just looking to cash in on this & quot ; angel & quot ; suggestion . Shortly after this film came out , I was advised as a pre-school aid to instruct our parents about hazard in this film .	1
this is one of my favorite christmas movies and i watch it every year . I ca n't wait to get it on dvd in widescreen and 5.1 surround . I used to have it on vhs but it was recorded and a scene or two got chopped off so i ca n't wait to see the whole thing . Get this movie .	1
Helen ( Dorothy McGuire ) is the beautiful , young caretaker for the bed-ridden Mrs. Warren ( Ethel Barrymore ) . She works w/ Mrs. Warren in her huge mansion , along w/ the two Warren sons , Blanche the secretary , the nurse , and Mr. Oats and his wife ( Elsa Lanchester from Bride Of Frankenstein and Willard ) . All would be just fine if not for two facts : # 1- There 's a serial murderer on the loose who appears to only prey upon those he deems to be imperfect / disabled in some way . # 2- Helen has been mute ever since a tragic childhood event . Now , Helen is in this mansion at night , in the middle of a hellish thunderstorm , and the killer shows up to take care of business ! THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE is a wonderful old-school suspense / thriller w/ loads of atmosphere and a mysterious perpetrator who remains unknown until the final act . McGuire is geat in her silent role , and shows how to be smart in the face of terror . The rest of the cast is also quite good , especially Ethel Barrymore , who somehow manages to be both comical and solemnly foreboding at once ! Highly recommended ...	1
Dorothy McGuire delivers an amazing performance as a traumatised mute in this expertly-directed classic of the thriller genre . THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE ( based on the book `` Some Must Watch '' by Ethel Lina White ) is a moodily-lit , delicious treat for the true lovers of screen thrillers.In a picture-perfect New England town , someone is murdering young women who have physical afflictions . Could Helen ( Dorothy McGuire ) be next ? Following an horrific event in her past , Helen has lived her life as a mute . Employed as companion to the bedridden Mrs Warren ( Ethel Barrymore ) , Helen is told that her life is in danger and she must leave the house immediately . Is the killer closer than she thinks ... .and when the killer makes their presence known , will Helen find the courage to scream ? THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE is a complete thrill-ride , from it 's prologue set in a turn-of-the-century movie theater , to the emotionally-devastating conclusion.Dorothy McGuire holds the whole movie together , with her masterly performance as mute Helen . It 's much subtler than a silent movie or `` dumb show '' performance , nor is it melodramatic ; the amount of emotion McGuire is able to convey with the simplest look , and the way her eyes tell you what 's inside her head , is incredible . It 's a total tour-de-force from an actress who was never really given her full dues in Hollywood.Ethel Barrymore , George Brent and Rhonda Fleming lead the outstanding supporting cast , with Elsa Lanchester as the drunken maid , and Sara Allgood as Mrs Warren 's comical nurse.The art direction and cinematography in THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE are all showcased to their best advantage with this new DVD release . There 's some minor print damage and water-marking in some areas but on the whole it 's a very pleasing transfer for a movie made in 1946 . THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE will be a no-brainer for classic movie collectors , and lovers of quality thrillers . ( Single-sided , single-layer disc ) .	1
I did some checking and I discovered this film , The Spiral Staircase , originally released in 1946 , has been remade a few times over the years ... once in 1961 with Eddie Albert , Hayley Mills , Elizabeth Montgomery , and Gig Young ( a made for TV feature ) , again in 1975 with Jacqueline Bisset , Christopher Plummer , and John Phillip Law ( a full length feature this time ) , and then yet again in 2000 with Nicollette Sheridan and Judd Nelson ( this last one , also a made for TV feature , sounds like a real winner ) . Adapted from the novel `` Some Must Watch '' by Ethel Lina White , and directed Robert Siodmak ( The Killers , Criss Cross , The Crimson Pirate ) , the film stars the demure , beautiful , and extremely talented Dorothy McGuire ( Three Coins in the Fountain , Old Yeller , Swiss Family Robinson ) . Also appearing is George Brent ( The Corpse Came C.O.D. , FBI Girl ) , Kent Smith ( Cat People , The Curse of the Cat People ) , Rhonda Fleming ( A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court ) , Gordon Oliver ( Jezebel ) , Elsa Lanchester ( Bride of Frankenstein , Murder by Death ) , Sara Allgood ( Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ) , Rhys Williams ( How Green Was My Valley ) , James Bell ( I Walked with a Zombie ) , and Ethel Barrymore , who won an Oscar in her previous , supporting role in the Cary Grant film None But the Lonely Heart ( 1944 ) .The film , set at the turn of the century , begins with the murder of a woman at a hotel , one where a crowd of people just happen to be in attendance of an old timey picture show ( the kind where a pianist plays the accompanying score ) , including Helen ( McGuire ) , a mute woman who works as a servant for a local well to do family . Around this time we learn the murder is not an isolated incident , as someone is stalking women with physical infirmities and doing way with them ( the woman in the hotel had a severe limp ) . Dr. Parry ( Smith ) , who has a keen interest in Helen and her condition , makes the scene and offers her a ride home , but halfway there he 's called away so Helen must walk the rest of the way , and it seems , along with the darkness ( and a menacing figure lurking about ) , a storm is coming ( in more ways than one ) . Once Helen arrives at her place of employment , a very large manor owned by a family named Warren , we meet a whole slew of interesting characters . There 's Professor Warren ( Brent ) , his secretary Blanche ( Fleming ) , the Professor 's playboy half brother Stephen ( Oliver ) who 's just returned from a long European trip , their bedridden mother Mrs. Warren ( Barrymore ) , Mrs. Oates ( Lanchester ) , the cook , her husband ( Williams ) , and finally Nurse Barker ( Allgood ) . As the storm outside continues to build , so does the ominous sense of danger , due in part to Mrs. Warren 's continual insistences Helen leave the house as soon as possible , as she seems to have serious doubts about Helen 's safety ( one could n't blame her given her sons , one a smarmy mouth ne'er-do-well , the other a bookish fop ) . There 's safety in numbers , but as various members of the household are called away for whatever reason , Helen soon discovers she probably should have listened to Mrs. Warren and got while the gettin ' was good ... I enjoyed this film a lot , especially in terms of the huge , slightly creepy manor which most of the story took place . The distinctive shadows , darkened corridors , elaborate sets pieces , combined with masterful directing , featuring some strong and off putting killer point of view shots , and spooky musical scoring , all went a long way towards creating an overall eerie atmosphere , a continual sense of evil present as right from the beginning ... that and the fact we knew from early on the killer followed Helen home and gained entry into the house . The characters are very distinctive , and played expertly by a highly professional cast , the real standouts being Dorothy McGuire , who has practically no speaking lines throughout the film and must rely solely on her expressionistic abilities , and also Ethel Barrymore as the infirmed , but certainly not mentally impaired Mrs. Warren , once a woman of great strength , now confined to her bed by afflictions brought on by advanced age ( she was actually nominated for an Oscar in her role here ) . The one thing that really gave me the heebie jeebies as far as this film went was Ms. Barrymore as she would often seem to be feigning sleep , but then you 'd look over at her and her eyes would be wide open , taking in everything that was going on ... Bette Davis may have had peepers distinctive enough for Kim Carnes to pen a song about , but Ethel Barrymore certainly could have given her a run for the money ( that and the fact the words Bette Davis comes across much better in a song than the words Ethel Barrymore ) . And talking about eyes , the killer was often displayed only in much abbreviated form , hands , a foot , etc. , but usually by a close up of one wide , glaring eye full of murderous intent . As far as the identity of the killer , it was really anyone 's game up until a certain point , and by then the writers wisely saw no point in keeping it a mystery anymore , as most everyone should have gotten clued in by then . I did pick up on it a little earlier than I expected , but only because of the not entirely subtle pushing of other characters as suspects drove me to my own conclusions . As to the motive behind the murders , that aspect did remain secret until it was revealed . I suppose one might be able to discern it before the reveal , but I think this is a much more difficult element to peel away from the story , even though the pieces were there , which is , in my opinion , a real credit towards those who originally wrote , and then adapted this intricate story to the screen . For me , the most harrowing sequences involved the latter ones where various characters ventured , armed only with a candle , down into the dark , drafty , spooky , cobwebbed basement , filled with niches and hidey holes . All in all this is a wonderfully crafted film , and while I have n't seen the various remakes , I have a pretty good feeling the original is probably still the best.The picture , presented in fullscreen , original aspect ratio ( 1.33:1 ) , looks beautifully sharp and clean , and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through extremely clear . The only extra featured on the DVD is a theatrical trailer for the Johnny Depp film Secret Window ( 2004 ) , and odd inclusion , I thought , but whatever.Cookieman108	1
I thought that I 'd actually seen this one years ago , but nothing seemed terribly familiar when I gave it a recent viewing . Dorothy McGuire excels at the woman-in-danger roles , and here she is as a young woman rendered mute by unspeakable tragedy in the past , acting as caretaker for a rather gruff and mean bedridden old woman ( Ethel Barrymore ) in a spooky old Gothic house filled with unpleasant , unhappy people . Young women have been dying in mysterious ways in the town ( where , we never learn , but it 's a late-Victorian atmosphere - actually 1916 - that seems like it could be in the same neighborhood as the Amberson mansion ( from 1942 's THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS ) , in a slightly better part of town than George Bailey 's abode ( from IT 'S A WONDERFUL LIFE in 1946 ) and it looks like murder ! The constable believes the killer is in the vicinity , and what 's more he 's killing women with disabilities.McGuire is as I said terrific in this kind of role , fragile and yet always with a little underlying steel , though she may not be the most memorable individual in the terrific cast , with George Brent somewhat uncharacteristically creepy as the Professor who to all intents and purposes runs the house for his bedridden mother , Rhonda Fleming as his assistant , and Elsa Lanchester as the hard-drinking housekeeper . Director Robert Siodmak is one of the key figures in the postwar mystery-noir cycle and he packs plenty of suspense into less than 90 minutes here , helped ably by the terrifically atmospheric monochrome photography of Nicholas Musuraca . And the AMBERSONS mention above was n't accidental - the production was designed by the same man , Albert S. D'Agostino , responsible for that film 's wonderful look.The IMDb and some other sources list this as `` film noir '' , but that 's somewhat debatable -- it 's a period piece and there really is n't a proper noir protagonist unless it 's McGuire . Whatever you call it , it 's very well-shot and the suspense is palpable throughout , and enthusiasts of noir or 40s melodrama who have n't gotten to it for some reason certainly should do so .	1
I love this movie very much . I watch it all the time because it has a good cast . I love the mystery and suspense as well . i would recommend this movie to anyone I know who likes this type of genre .	1
The extra vulnerability of the handicapped has been a magnet to attract some fine directors of suspense ... The fulcrum of Robert Siodmak 's 'The Spiral Staircase ' was the fact that the beautiful and expressive Dorothy McGuire was dumb - deprived of her speech by shock ... Her terror when death stalked had to be wordless , and it was all the more potent ... She could not communicate , she could not plead or call for help ... It was New England in 1906 , and she was employed by the bedridden mistress ( Ethel Barrymore ) of an old mansion ( decorated in Victorian style ) . On the girl 's day off , a disabled girl was found murdered in the little town . It was the third such murder ... In each case the victim had been physically handicapped - and , as we learned later , the murderer killed because he could not tolerate imperfection ... There was a chilling start to the suspense as Dorothy McGuire walked home through a stormy night , rattling a twig against railings ... In a lightning flash we saw - but she did not - the silhouette of a man watching her ... On into the house and , as she paused on a landing , we saw the feet of the man on another landing ... waiting . And then , in a close-up of his eye , we saw her face reflected - an imperfect face ... On this level the tension was maintained in visual terms , through the murder of another girl in the house and the mute 's discovery of the body , and her belief that she knows the murderer ... She tricks him into a room and locks him in ... but , as she is to find , she has locked up the wrong man ... Ethel Barrymore received the film 's only Academy Award nomination , as Best Supporting Actress ... McGuire would have to wait another year to be nominated as Best Actress , for her great role in Elia Kazan 's emotional 'Gentleman 's Agreement ' , 1947 .	1
I have given this film a 5 star rating , even though I have not seen the upcoming dvd release . I am also aware that this very special film is not for everyone . But unless the DVD is incrediby botched , my 5 stars stand proudly.It 's difficult to review this film because I do n't want to spoil the experience of watching such a slippery , convoluted experiment in cinematic narrative . Let me just say that this film 's narrative structure is highly unusual , and the frequent sudden shifts of reference could cause a bit of vertigo in the viewer as they try to figure out just what the heck is going on , only to have their hypothisis shattered ( or at least tightly twisted ) a few minutes later . This twisting , shifting narrative is fascinating to me , even though others may find it annoying . It 's like living in a chinese box puzzle.Perhaps I am especially partial to the film because I saw it in its original theatrical release . The theatre in which I watched it apparently had a very cool manager . During the last scenes of the film , when all the temporal and spatial references collapse , this theatre staged yet another plot twist by presenting yet another twist to the plot , enacted by a live `` cast '' , sort of like the Rocky Horror Picture Show . The effect was startling and disorienting.SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! ! Do not read any farther if you have n't seen the film before.Imagine This : There is a movie , a silent movie , playing on a theatre screen . In the theatre , there is a murderer holding a person hostage in front of the screen , but this , too , is a movie . . . and in the theatre in which it is playing , there is a murderer holding a person hostage in front of the screen . . . but this , too , is a movie . . . and in thetheatre in which it is playing there is a murderer holding a person hostage in front of the screen . . . but this , too , is a movie . . . and in the theatre in which it is playing -- the theatre where YOU are sitting . . . there is a murderer holding a hostage in front of the screen . Yes , this murderer and his hostage are in the theatre with you , and the hostage was sitting on the same row you are sitting on . Then the police break in to all four theatres ( yes , even the one where you are sitting ) and shots are fired , and the movie ends . On the screen is the interior of Theatre number 3 , and the credits unfold on that screen , as people in the MOVIE begin to file out of the theatre where they were sitting , amd apparently somehow find themselves in the theatre where You are sitting , because people are also exiting from THIS theatre.Now , of course , unless you really work on it , the live show in the theatre where you are sitting , will not happen . Police will probably not break down your door and shoot the villian holding a friend of yours hostage in front of your tv , but when you actually watch ANGUISH , why not imagine this 4th theatre , this is actually your TV room , and that this fourth layer of the plot is actually taking place in your home.PS : As long as we 're spilling spoilers , let me invite you to be sure you have your surrounds run up all the way when watching the film . There is an extremely disorienting disconnect between layers early in the movie , as we assume we are watching one movie , but then begin to hear conversation and `` popcorn crunching '' all about us . Then the image is reframed and you realize that you have been watching a movie within a movie.Watch With : The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse , Memento , Identity , The Tingler , and any film that has an experimental narrative structure , such as Last Year at Marienbad , Intolerance , Time Code , etc .	1
Bought this video for my granddaughter who wanted the Robie House Lego set for Christmas . This video will show her how it fits into Wright 's portfolio - she 's 9 .	1
I have been to the falling waters home in Pennsylvania and found it very beautiful.I enjoy looking at all the homes Frank built and saw four homes on one block in Milwaukee , WI being restored . I would love to live in one of his homes if I could afford it .	1
But then again I love BBC television - especially the older stuff where there is great language ; no violence , no swearing - nice change .	1
So well done . We 've watched it several times . So sad there are only two seasons but it was canceled ironically because of Downtown Abbey . If you love all things British ( or even if you do n't ) this is worth the investment of your time .	1
This program is a very close second to Downton Abby . The first & # 34 ; soap opera & # 34 ; program , I watched , was The Oneidan Line , in the 1970 's . Now that I have seen some of Upstairs Downstairs , I will be watching for more marvelous programs . This show has raised the bar to a whole new level .	1
I 'm sort of glad I started with the fifth season , because while I still enjoy the characters in their first season form , I have a greater appreciation for their incredible development as people over the course of the series . Having seen the beloved cook Mrs. Bridges in her final form in Season Five , it was positively shocking to see her sell some of the household 's food for her own personal gain . I know that it was done at the time -- it may well have been expected and accepted by employers -- but I could hardly have imagined her doing so ! Had I watched the series from beginning to end as most people do , I would have missed this sense of personal growth and integrity , because I would already have forgotten the passing event by the end of the series . That would have been sad.In Season One , the viewer is introduced to all the main characters . Their edges are `` raw '' here , because they have yet to undergo the smoothing and sorting process that occurs among members of the same household . The era is the very early 1900 's and the costumes , manners and technology produce a sense of ambiance that is almost like being there . The social inequities of the period are the central focus of this season , probably because it is the aspect of early twentieth century England most likely to come to mind to writers wanting to create a `` real '' experience for viewers . Certainly to anyone steeped in Dickens as most of the contributers probably were , this would be the easiest theme to begin with for a new program . This would also have been a good point to pick during the turbulant 1970s , when everything about society was ( again ) being questioned by the young of the time.Most of the season deals with the realities of being a poor person dependent upon a wealthy household for his or her well being . The steep fall from the safety of a domestic position to destitution is made very clear . The sacrifice of personal dignity or even physical integrity in order to avoid the crushing poverty of urban England is made abundantly clear by the events in the life of the house maid Sarah , the scullery maid Emily , and the footman Albert . Much of the action seems to be seen from the perspective of the upper parlor maid , Rose , who throughout the seasons takes a very leading role in events both upstairs and downstairs . By using her as their foil , the writers manage to make the realities of the more unfortunate characters much more realistic . Rose sees the rise and fall of many individuals in the household and clings tenaciously to the safety of her role in the house . She is also witness to the frustrations of those above stairs , especially the younger members of the household who have a foot in both the old world of their elders and the new one that is being technologically forced on them.Above stairs , the social mores of the upper class reveal the extent to which they are also hamstrung by expectations and demands . James Belamy is unable to find satisfaction in his role as heir . The acceptable careers open to him are limited and framed by expectations . Elizabeth , his sister , having acheived a level of education and social awareness that is not generally allowed in upper class women , struggles unsuccessfully with the social ills of her time , only to find she is not taken seriously and that she is completely unprepared for the realities of the poor or to make any effective changes in their condition . She can only give them food and clothing , a bandaid on a situation that obviously requires major surgery ! Lady Marjorie -- and indirectly her mother -- a woman who has the mind and abilities of a man but who must work politically through her husband leads a pampered but rather boring life , waiting to host influential parties for her husband . Her husband Richard , is a man of common origins made 1st viscount Bellamy . His upbringing as a middle class person -- son of a minister -- puts his values and his actions often at odds , creating a marvelous dramatic dissonance . His decisions , while noble , are not always realistic or wise given the situations in which he finds himself , making him the very illustration of a man whose good intentions lead so often to disaster or at least unpleasantness . Married to an aristocrat whose money finances his political career and lifestyle , he is often unable to do what his conscience dictates but must dance to the tune played by his in-laws.What stands out most , especially after viewing the final season , is how the sometimes tragic events of the lives of these people brings them closer and closer together . Their consideration of and feelings for one another over the course of the 5 seasons is heartwarming . Even while we realize that the social ills of the time in which the characters lived were unpleasant , we ca n't help but feel it is from this type of caring that individuals survived and improved their world , and it gives us hope for our own.A wonderful period piece , and marvelous drama .	1
This is a great series , although very short indeed ! However there are at least 7 episodes , i believe , slated for 2012 ! If you are a fan of Downton Abbey , you will hopefully find this entertaining . Downton is unmatched , but this fills a loss when Downton is on hiatus ! The casting is quite stellar , especially Eileen Atkins and Anne Reid , two of my favorites . The series harbors on the political aspects of England in the 1930 's , a few bits on the fascist movement , however there was enough drama that did NOT include politics to make it worth while . It 's a young husband and wife starting their life anew and adapting to society around them . The house is absolutely beautiful too ! I thought the casting was great and there was no one character that you `` love to hate '' , which i thought was kind of nice for a change . Although flawed both great and small , everyone had some sort of redeeming quality ! I 'm looking forward to the 2012 season !	1
Despite being created in the early 1970 's , this series seems like it could have been created in Edwardian England . I remember watching bit 's of it as a child on TV and find the DVDs absolutely spellbinding . Being able to watch episode after episode at my leisure , on my schedule is absolutely luxurious . I have a portable DVD player and this series is great to travel with since there are so many hours per disk .	1
I am spoiled by Downton Abbey , but this is worth watching for British history lovers , this goes to the years leading up to the second world war and the famous abdication of an English King ! !	1
I remember seeing this show on PBS as a child . I became interested in watching it after seeing Downton Abbey . I really liked the first season of the series . I watched it in a marathon over a cold winter weekend . If you like Downton Abbey , give it a watch .	1
I chose a 4 star rating , because this must have been live filming because a lot of lines were flubbed , and the actors were clumsy occasionally . As the episodes progressed , the acting became better , and the actress that played Sarah was exceptional in their acting . Also Hudson and Rose were excellent .	1
Love show depicting the life of the upper crust and those who serve them in the early 1900s . Very enjoyable and touching .	1
I found this series very interesting . Lots of happenings that I did n't expect . Hope to see more . World war two history along with drama	1
The smoke breaks are the best ! Love it all : script , casting , direction , sets , costumes , lighting , pregnant pauses , history , and the incredible attention to detail .	1
Love this series and Amazon Prime . I love being able to stream in great movies and my favorite television series.Thank you Amazon .	1
How nice to watch the fist episode , of the first season , of the first show , that started America 's love affair with British period dramas . I remember watching this with my mother when it was new ; going back today , it 's more enjoyable than ever . Downton Abbey is but a `` wannabe '' of what Upstairs Downstairs invented ; it 's not about the expensive wardrobe and scenery , it 's the great characters and storylines . Thanks , Amazon , for letting us relive these fabulous shows ! There 's nothing more to say except : Watch This Show ! Wait ! - Yes , there is something else to say : Pauline Collins ! Although she only appears in some episodes , her evolving character , Sarah , adds more excitement to the show than all the other characters put together . If you ca n't watch all episodes of Upstairs Downstairs , make sure you do n't miss the ones featuring Pauline Collins as Sarah !	1
I really enjoyed this series . I had just finished Downton Abbey and was having withdrawal since we have to wait until January 2015 for the 5th season , when I found this . I loved the period of just before WWII . Wish they had made more ! Now I have to find something else to watch ! I am wondering if the 1970s series of Upstairs , Downstairs is any good .	1
After watching the original series , this second version I was left hanging , I was hoping there are more but just the same it 's alright . I missed Rose , the parlor maid .	1
This is an excellent British television drama that is almost a soap opera style of show . The show is about an aristocrat Sir Hallam Holland and his wife Lady Agnes moving back into the London home of his father . Upstairs Downstairs stands for the different life styles and cultures that existed in the home between the servants downstairs and the rich and highly connected owners living upstairs . Eaton Place 165 has a new generation living in the home but the head of the household maid is the same lady who worked in the house when she was a young maid.New staff is hired and some have to be properly trained and they have to get to know each other and learn to work together . Meanwhile Hallam 's mother Maud moves in and there is almost instant friction between Hallam , Lady Agnes and the mother-in-law living in the home . In addition Lady Agnes ' sister moves in and she is a socialist/fascist want-to-be who causes a lot of problems for Hallam and Agnes.This show contains a lot of drama , tension , personal conflict and it all is brought to the surface perfectly by the excellent cast of the show . The storyline is well done and the writers have done well writing a story that is interesting and fun to watch . I find it interesting to watch the British interpretation of historical characters like Mrs. Simpson , the woman who married the King , Herr Ribbentrop a Nazi leader working in England and the new King of England when he takes over after his brother abdicates his rank as King to marry Mrs. Simpson.The servants also play a major role in keeping the house running properly but also bringing in their own personal problems into the house . This first season sets a lot of ground work for the coming season and the building tensions between Germany and the rest of Europe right before WW II.One character who plays a major role in Season One and Two is Persephone who is the sister of Agnes . She is the sultry , sexy and troublemaking girl whom you will learn to hate . Her selfish and one sided nature is overwhelming and evil and you will either love her or hate her.This is an excellent show and my wife and I loved it . We rated it as a 5 star program .	1
This is the first series of Upstairs , Downstairs . Chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a Belgravia townhouse , Updown , as it is affectionately known , covers about twentyfive years . The first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908 . It introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle , barring a few later additions to the caste . Most of this first series concerns the career of Sarah , who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode . We also see the early stages of the career of Elizabeth Bellamy , daughter of the house , as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents . Some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white , due to a cameramen 's strike . I find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs . Some of the episodes are a bit off target , especially The Swedish Tiger , which is just plain weird , but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed . The first series is a great way to start your acquaintance with the residents of 165 Eaton Place .	1
You must watch the Upstairs Downstairs series from the 1970 ... the whole thing ties in so well and very interesting bit of history	1
When I was young I only heard of the original series of Upstairs downstairs and I only had access to the tv during the daytime . So I was only familiar with the name . So my curiosity got the better of me . I was hooked until I finished it.I say keep them coming , I have recommended it to friends and they love it .	1
Upstairs Downstairs is a successful new chapter of tne original 1970s hit series returns with all new episodes that is showing people who grew up with or seen the original or new audience members that had helped made Downton Abbey on PBS ' Masterpiece a success with Americans , the critics and the world over should enjoy this new Upstairs Downstairs on Masterpiece or on dvd ! I really love this new series with the acclaim of Downton Abbey and ca n't wait to see more of both soon !	1
Loved , loved , loved this new take on what was one of my favorite TV series of all time . The characters were beautifully drawn , and the plot ( s ) of each episode made me remember just why the original UD was so wonderful . I miss Mr. Hudson , but there are compensations , and every episode is a little gem . I just wish I could count on years and years of new episodes . In the USA we do n't have any idea how to make this kind of TV , more 's the pity .	1
This is nicely done and enjoyable but not as riveting as Downton Abbey . A good window into the time period .	1
I love the show , It shows how the house help can pretty well run the family and the household . They seem to keep the family on an even keel even though they have many problems of their own..Great ShowMama	1
Anyone who has n't seen the original Upstairs Downstairs series needs to do so ASAP ! ! One of the longest-running series in Brit history , and one of the most highly acclaimed , it is also the first series that examied the effects of World War 1 on the people who actually were in the trenches . It was produced for 7 years , and I 've seen the whole series several times ! ! Wonderful work ! ! Kathy	1
Upstairs Downstairs is a high class soap opera beautifully written and acted . The series shows the doings between the Bellamy family ( the folks upstairs ) and their servants ( the folks downstairs ) and how they interact . Woven into the soap opera is British history during Edwardian times up until the mid 1900s . During one show King Edward comes to dinner at the Bellamy residence leading to much cleaning and cooking . Along the way comes a big surprise for both the king and the Bellamy family.The show covered a wide range of sensitive topics including homosexuality , suicide , war and the effects thereof.This is one of the best British television series produced and while made in the 70s is timeless.Recommend .	1
I would recommend this drama series - it 's interesting and the characters are believable . It 's set at the beginning of World War 2 .	1
We are still watching these TV shows and like them very much . Thanks to Amazon Prime for giving us these shows .	1
I 'm hooked . Very entertaining ; not just humorous but offers a great insight into the emotions of the characters ; great acting also .	1
I am forever amazed at the quality of the television programs coming out of England . Downton Abbey and Upstairs , Downstairs are two great programs . I am now starting to buy other programs with the same result - superb programs that are a delight to watch !	1
Reading some of the other reviews , I see that I 'm not alone in originally checking out `` Upstairs , Downstairs '' as a way to fill the void until the next season of `` Downton Abbey '' started ! : - ) I do remember UD being on TV and quite popular in the '70s , but I never watched it . I decided to try it now , since I knew it had a similar premise to DA . It was n't `` love at first sight , '' but by the third episode I was hooked . DA is still my favorite , but I do find UD very entertaining and look forward to each new episode . I have just started Season 2.Of course , it is true that it 's not the lavish production that DA is . As some other reviewers mentioned , it is set up more like a play with limited sets , and I find the characters on DA more attractive and likeable , but the characters in UD have grown on me the more I watch . There are some similarities where I think DA may have copied UD.I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said there should be subtitles/closed captioning . I always use the subtitle option when available , esp . when watching something where the actors have an accent . There 's nothing wrong with my hearing , but I do n't think anyone catches every single word of every single movie , and subtitles do help in this regard . The British accent can sometimes be hard to decipher , esp when the actors talk faster or more quietly . I 'm sure the Brits feel the same way about American actors ! ; - ) The way I see it , now I have TWO great miniseries to look forward to watching ! Still waiting for the new season of `` Mad Men . '' Is there any series past or present that is similar to MM that I should check out ? In summary , I think that if you love Abbey you would probably like Upstairs , Downstairs . Do n't overthink it or compare too much . Just sit back and enjoy it !	1
I am a fan of a lot of BBC shows and had always wanted to watch this series but from the beginning . It was FABULOUS ! I love the characters and storylines ( and I hate saying this ) but so much more than Downton Abbey ! The cast was a good looking cast which I ca n't readily say about Downton Abbey . I wish there were more like a Season 3 !	1
Always entertaining to watch fashionable British snobbery . It is nicely intertwined with significant historical fascist moments in Europe and high class soap opera-ish drama . I rate it a 4 out of 5 because it started slowly but once you get into it , it is a classic worth watching .	1
This is an older series than Downton Abbey . The characters are not as richly developed ; I could predict their responses to conflicts after the first episode . I began to feel a bit tired of the scenes always within the same townhouse rooms . It was fine for an older BBC production , but I did not feel as involved with the characters as I did with Downton Abbey .	1
This second season of the classic Upstairs , Downstairs is an update , jumping from the 1920 's to thebeginning of the Second World War . It 's an entirely different family , but still keeps to the originaltheme of the contrast between the classes . It 's extremely entertaining among the upper class , notso much among the lower class . Lots of drama set in a turbulent time ... I loved it !	1
Going through dowton Abbey withdrawals so I decided to check out the old series first . found that very boring . this new series is much more interesting . loved it !	1
We really enjoy following the lives of these people -- the servants and the served ; witnessing how their lives intersect and depend on one another .	1
He is one of the best Mr Rochester 's everI am glad that I added it to my collection ofJane Eyre movies	1
This is probably the best film version I 've seen of Jane Eyre . One of my friends , who is no fan of the book or the other film versions , commented that she `` got '' the characters for the first time when she caught a rerun on A & E and I 'd have to agree . The essence of Jane and Rochester is all here : Passion . It 's restrained in `` plain and little '' Jane , who inside is all rebelliousness , and smoldering in Rochester , who here is just as gruff and domineering and bad-tempered as he ought to be . Watching this film I can believe that this version of Rochester and Jane are passionately in love with one another . I do n't believe that in the other versions I 've seen , including the most recent PBS version . Cutting out portions of the book to get at the meat of the story was a wise decision that made for a much better film .	1
I like this version very much , I recommend it	1
This is a true girls move and makes my wife and her girlfriends quiet for at least two hours , happy Wife happy Life	1
I received this DVD yesterday and watched it immediately . Having seen part of it on TV , my initial feelings were confirmed . This is the best movie rendition out of the 4 Jane Eyre movies I have seen . Ciaran Hinds is fantastic as Mr. Rochester ; as I always pictured him , dark , loud , brash , demanding , but hurt and helpless with regard to his situation . Mr. Hinds 's acting in this movie prompted me purchase Jane Austen 's `` Persuasion '' , starring him , and I find it excellent as well .	1
I really like this version of Jane Eyre . Fans of romantic/historical movies will enjoy the detailed sets and costumes as well as the high drama . Fans of the novel will appreciate a script that 's true to the book without ploddingly recreating it word-for-word or -- just as bad -- peppered with anachronisms in an attempt to make Jane Eyre hip and modern.Samantha Morton brings Jane 's underlying strength of character to life and Ciaran Hinds , as Mr. Rochester , does very well with a character that can easily be overplayed to the point of silliness . They are supported by a strong cast , including Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax . The overall production value is as high as the caliber of the acting.This is a good , strong production , though I do wish that the DVD came with some extras .	1
The William Hurt and Timothy Dalton versions of this movie were good . But , here 's a Jane Eyre that I truly enjoyed . An orphan raised in an orphanage , arrives at Thornfield Hall to care for an orphan , and falls in love with her seemingly infallible employer . It is a classic that grips you since in the end , the characters overcome the worst and find true happiness.The young Jane was fantastic with her willful impestuousness . Samantha Morton brought spunk and humor to her character and I found it refreshing . And , Ciaran Hinds gives a lighthearted yet dramatic performance which makes him the perfect , indomitable , unfathomable , mysterious Edward Rochester . The actors exquisitely portrayed the conflict of pain , love , and passion , so that this movie epitomizes what Bronte fans look forward to .	1
Admittedly , this is a truncated version , which is not entirely faithful to the novel . If this is a problem for anyone , this is not a version for you ( many others to choose from ) . However , I can not help liking just about anything with Ciaran Hinds in it . IMO , he IS Mr. Rochester . I also loved Samantha Morton as Jane.I kind of just wish that they used these same actors and plugged them into a more full length miniseries , rather than a feature length film . Jane Eyre really needs to be done as a miniseries.That said , this is a workable , enjoyable version well worth a view for Hinds and Morton .	1
I love the different versions of this story its just depend of your liking Cerion Hinds and Samantha Morton Verses the other other 3 versions know of .. this was a great version of this pair actors	1
Yes , I 've read Jane Eyre , for the first time when I was twelve . And , yes , I liked the book . But this movie is n't the book and I liked it as well.One thing the movie did very well in the beginning was to condense years of abuse by Jane 's aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst into a few key horrific scenes that also point out the affection that Jane felt for her friend Helen , the few kind teachers and later her pupils.Ciaran Hinds as the hero begins with a great deal of roaring and bluster , but here and there are hints that this is a screen he uses to protect himself from the pain of intimacy . The key to Mr. Rochester 's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his & quot ; grand passion & quot ; and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored . Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester 's passion for him that overset her reason.Samantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature -- Lowood School taught her more than reading , writing and geography . Her plummet into the pain of the truth and then her coming to understand the power of the passion that grips her is very well played.If I want to re-experience my version of Jane Eyre I will reread the book . That does not mean I can not enjoy another interpretation of the story .	1
Well , I just saw this on DVD so I 'm not sure why it is described as VHS tape only but the DVD definitely exists . Overall , I thought it a solid documentary of the Duke . All of his character traits are discussed and elucidated which allows us to separate the man from the gigantic legend which has been constructed around him . Most pleasing is that Wayne never took himself too seriously as evidenced by his appearance at Harvard and the making of True Grit . His range as an actor has totally been underappreciated . Ron Howard points out that no leading man in Hollywood today would have taken his role in The Searchers as it 's far too complex and nuance filled for our modern times , but not for John Wayne . He had his own times . John Wayne was and is an American legend , and , although it 's a clich & eacute ; , I wish we had more men like him today . As an aside , without commercials many of these biographies are a slim and brisk 90 minutes which makes you wonder why we ever agreed to watch TV in the first place .	1
There seems to be many versions of this film and this one is equal in interest and quality to any other ones . Well made with a good ending that is slightly better than the others .	1
Fast deliver and fair price . The story line is rich and the performances are great but near the ending , and the ending felt rushed thru and I felt it had missing pieces from the story line ,	1
This version is soooooooooooo much better than the polanski one that one was boring this Tess has much better acting and is much more interesting . One day I was in the mood to watch this with my hubby at the starting of the film my sister & mother & niece came over they ( all of them including hubby who has never seen it before ended up on really getting into it my mom was even talking about it the next day ( if you knew my mother she is not that type of person ) it is really a good movie	1
This is a great box-set of some of the episodes of & quot ; W.K.R.P . In Cincinnati & quot ; - the best sit-com in T.V.-history ! . You wo n't find a better written , more perfectly cast , gloriously acted , and funnier show anywhere . However , these 8 episodes are by no means the best ones . -They 're all waiting to be released . Hopefully & quot ; New Video & quot ; will put the whole series out . No other sit-com deserves it more , I can assure you . So please , how about it ? . But in the meantime , get this box and wet your appetite . K.r.p . rules ! .	1
I consider WKRP to be one of THE FUNNIEST TV shows EVER . It was the right cast at the right time and everything else about it was just ... right.The only reason I titled my review , `` Almost Perfect '' is because in the versions of the show you see now , all the old rock music has been deleted and replaced with studio recordings of the songs by unknown artists or just bland anonymous music . If you saw the series when it aired in the 70s , it was true to what it was ... a rock and roll radio station playing the big artists of the 70s . Thanks to the lawyers and greedy music companies , the original music that was in the series got surgically removed and replaced by what you 'll hear now . Do n't get me wrong ... the show is still HILARIOUS . It 's just not as perfect as it was when it originally aired . Hopefully at some point in the future , some smart cookie will release WKRP in its original form as it aired on CBS.This show should be up there with M*A*S*H and All in the Family so far as history goes . It 's really THAT GOOD . From hearing Les Nessman describe live turkeys hit the pavement `` like bags of wet cement '' to Arthur Carlson slap his foot to wake it up because he thought he was putting on foot powder that turned out to really be cocaine , it 's one funny episode after another.Do n't bother renting the episodes that aired after they tried to revive the show in the 80s without Andy Travis and much of the original cast . It 's like Caddyshack 2 : a poor , poor attempt to recapture the magic of the original . The original episodes that aired in the late 70s are GOLDEN though . Rent 'em , buy 'em or whatever . Just be prepared to laugh and laugh a lot if you 've never seen WKRP before or if you have n't seen it in a long time .	1
This is one of the best new titles to come along in quite a while . The 4 parts of this epic are spectacularly produced , marvelously written , finely acted , and are interesting , entertaining , engrossing and instructional all at once.The detail of these productions is superb , as is the sense of place and time . Adventure , history , drama , all percolate through these works . The sea battles are astounding , the human dramas compelling . Hornblower is heroic , but believable . He is human , but his humanity is of an extraordinary sort . A compelling hero indeed ! This series is a must !	1
After having read ( and loved ) all 20 of the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian , I was a bit hesitant to watch the Hornblower series . The O'brian books are just so good , it was hard to think that Horatio could live up to what I was expecting . After receiving this series as a gift from my wife , however , I felt that I had to watch them . I regret every day I postponed the experience . They are exhilerating thrill rides through 18th century British naval escapades . They have an excellent mix of accuracy and thrills and the casting is pretty much perfect . I can not wait to see the what will come next and hope that A & amp ; E continues to put quality storytelling first in the further adventures of Mr. Hornblower .	1
When I first saw this series I had to know more about the history of that time ! I+ also liked the swash buckling sailing adventures of the time ! I would recommend this great series !	1
This is a very good adaptation of the Hornblower saga . The stories are ( as has been said ) all from the first book and have been changed slightly , but with understandable dramatic and narrative reasons . The acting throughout is marvellous and the ships themselves deserve credit for the beauty and power they symbolise . I ca n't wait for the next set to be made !	1
I remember these as a child . I loved them then , and I love them now . Although they may seem a little campy now , the interaction of Emma Peele and Patrick McGee is as delightful as ever .	1
James Bond , move over ! This is a set of SEVEN , 52-minute entries from the great and brilliant team of Patrick Macnee ( as the aristocratic John Steed ) and Diana Rigg ( as the tantalizing Emma Peel ) . The Rigg years were definitely the best ones and there is one other set from 1966 ( also with Rigg , it offers SIX episodes ) so do n't confuse them ! All these episodes were shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen . Here 's a rundown of the episodes : '' The Danger Makers '' -- The '60s version of the TV show `` Jackass '' ! Steed and Peel have to ascertain why these important British officials continue to challenge suicide -- and some succeed ! Written by Roger Marshall . `` A Touch of Brimstone '' -- This one was banned from American television because Emma Peel dons high-laced boots , a spiked dog collar and a very skimpy outfit ! Here , we have The Hellfire Club , hoaxsters , and murder ! Written by Brian Clemens . `` A Sense of History '' -- It 's a battle over economic theory , by medieval Robin Hood types . But these denizens of the woods ( and a college campus ) do n't mind killing those who disagree with their views . This is a superb episode . Written by Martin Woodhouse . `` How to Succeed ... at Murder '' -- Business executives are being knocked off ... by their feminist secretaries ? ! ? The trail leads Steed and Mrs. Peel to an elite perfumery but the ring leader is quite elusive . Written by Brian Clemens . `` Honey for the Prince '' -- A Middle-eastern prince on a diplomatic mission is the target for assassination . Steed and Mrs. Peel intervene . Diana Rigg was never HOTTER than she was in this special `` Bonus Episode '' . Written by Brian Clemens . `` What the Butler Saw '' -- The secret defense plans are stolen ! Steed must take on the disguise of a student butler to resolve the mystery . Written by Brian Clemens . `` The House That Jack Built '' -- Here , we have a psychological thriller . Mrs. Peel inherits an estate from her `` Uncle Jack , '' and is subsequently trapped inside a carnivalistic madhouse . Steed rushes to the rescue . This is a great one . Written by Brian Clemens.I do n't know if you get the same deal if you purchase the DVD set -- with the VHS set , you 'll get 3 tapes , with two episodes per tape ( except on one tape where there 's the `` bonus episode , '' which makes three episodes on that one ) , for a total of 7 episodes . The tapes are not copy-protected.There were Avengers episodes prior to 1965 but they were n't quite as good -- they were more soap opera-ish . Macnee had two or three different lady-partners during those earlier years and those gals simply were n't as dynamic as Rigg . Also , the music , action , and story-writing much improved in '65 , which is when `` The Avengers '' got launched on to American television -- I watched every one of these episodes at the time . These black-and-white Macnee-Rigg entries continued through 1966 , ( it went color after that and Rigg eventually left the series ) . In the end , '65 and '66 were the two best years of all .	1
This set is a great way to be introduced to the Avengers . It contains some of the most outrageous episodes in the series . First up Never Say Die with Christopher Lee . This episode was very typical of the series and shows off how quirky it was . Epic is over the top and a little to much . But that was the intent by having it take place on a movie studio set , a first for a tv series I believe.The Superlative Seven is a quick fun episode done like Then There Were None type story . Donald Sutherland and Charlotte Rampling show up in this episode and due very well.The Avengers was a show that broke all of the boudaries and really could not be pigeon holed . Great show !	1
Although somewhat campy at times , The Avengers was an intellectual show , featuring puzzling mysteries , witty dialogue , bits of comedy , and an incredibly suave , cool agent in John Steed . With the introduction of Emma Peel , this great show became a phenomenon sure to remain a part of our culture for decades to come . Diana Rigg as Mrs. Peel is mesmerizing . Here we have a beautiful woman who is a brilliant scientist , a martial arts master , a great detective , and a special agent second to none . While most female television characters of the time tended to their families , Mrs. Peel busied herself in safeguarding her nation . Steed himself is no match for her in terms of intellect , but together they make an unbeatable team , with a magical chemistry that is readily apparent from the very start.This set contains the first six Emma Peel episodes . Mrs. Peel quickly evolves from Steed 's helper to Steed 's equal . It took a little while to flesh out the new character , I believe ; thus , these episodes seem to get progressively better as they go along . `` The Town of No Return '' is rather a weak story to my mind , but Mrs. Peel does show us her combat skills , which at this point seem rather contrived . `` The Gravediggers '' is much more interesting , witty , and satisfying . It is in fact one of my favorite episodes . Beginning with problems with the nation 's defense system , the story features cemeteries , doctors of an uncommon sort , and a brilliantly funny eccentric old gentleman with an overpowering love of trains -- the train ride he shares with the visiting John Steed is priceless ; it ends with Mrs. Peel tied up to a railroad track and almost killed by a miniature locomotive . This is The Avengers at its best . `` The Cybernauts , '' while good , is of great importance because it is the first episode ever shown in the USA and because it spawned two later `` sequels . '' `` Death at Bargain Prices '' features some of the best dialogue between Steed and Mrs. Peel , full of the sexual tension many reviewers like to point to . Only The Avengers could take the idea of a department store in London housing a nuclear bomb and make it work for audiences . `` Castle De'ath '' is a dark tale of history , treachery , and dungeon torture . Although the true purpose of the bad guys did not make complete sense to me , the story is very strong , succeeding in disproving my own suspicions ( as well as Mrs. Peels ' ) as to the identify of the culprit . Finally , `` The Master Minds '' rounds out this set with the story of an intellectual society whose members are unwittingly prompted to commit crimes against the Crown.Mrs . Peel really comes into her own in these last two tales . In the final episode , it is her intellect that allows Steed to penetrate the secretive society and learn its secrets ( although Mrs. Peel finds herself participating -- albeit without conscious knowledge -- in the nefarious plans of the master mind ) ; it is also her slyness that essentially saves Steed 's life in the end . However , `` Castle De'ath '' speaks volumes in my mind in terms of Mrs. Peel 's position in the society of the 1960s . All of the men in the episode , include John `` McSteed '' all wear traditional Scottish kilts . While this is nothing unusual for the locale in which the story takes place , nevertheless the fact remains that the only character who wears pants is Emma Peel . By this time , Mrs. Peel has shed any vestiges of being Steed 's helper and has become his unchallengeable equal . The Avengers is intelligent , humorous , decidedly `` cool '' television that towers above just about everything on the air today .	1
Each of Steed 's ladies made their own mark . Honor Blackman 's Kathy Gale , set the pace . Sleek sassy women , who were as smart as they were sexy . They held their own in a man 's world and did n't need someone to take care of them . Blackman and Rigg were two very positive role models in a time when most women were victims , wives or secretaries on telly at the time . Blackman made less of an impact in US , because they were generally shown as a Summer Replacement , to keep people from seeing reruns . Since they were run on ABC , tried to be recognized as a big-boy network the old Black and White Gales were not widely scene.Rigg came along and made Emma Peel a character that will go down in the hall of fame . She is as popular today , if not more so . So when she left -- to do as Blackman did -- go on to be a Bond girl , Steed had to have another partner . Enter Tara King . She gorgeous full figure Canadian with eyes to do for . They tried to play on her more feminine side ( and with horrid fashions ) . Seriously , the clothes designers for Tara needs shooting . For the most part , they could n't design more dumpy look clothes . They stuffed her in a series of wigs - some very bad - so point one , she was fighting an uphill battle . Also , the scripts were not as sharp . Even so Tara is charming and a pleasure to watch.Episodes include : Wish You Were HereStay TunedTake Me to Your LeaderFogHomocide and Old LaceLove AllGet-A-Way	1
It is a pleasure to relive these great episodes and to appreciate again how intelligent they assumed their audience to be . After all , any line like & quot ; Lady Bracknell , your handbag & quot ; is not designed for the high school dropout . Shot at a lower budget , these black and whites use exterior shots a lot more than do the more studio-bound color series . Some episodes ( & quot ; The Hour That Never Was & quot ; for example ) are a little slow-moving compared with gems like & quot ; The Return of the Cybernauts & quot ; and & quot ; Death at Bargain Prices. & quot ; My only negative comment is Death to Whoever tried to glamorize Rigg with all that horrible lip rouge about half way into the series . And while we are at it , since A & amp ; E nicely fit three episodes onto a single reel in Vol . 6 , why do all the others have only two ? But at any price , these tapes are unbeatable for sophisticated wit and tongue-in-cheek adventure . Er , A & amp ; E , what about the Tara King series ?	1
This was a great TV series . ` The Avengers '' was a popular 1960 's British fantasy-adventure series that focused on the exploits of a male-female duo in the service of the British government . The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee ( Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed ) . Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed 's first female partner . However , when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel , the show became an international sensation . Rigg brought sophistication , wit , charm and beauty , which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities . Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue . The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots . Popular at the height of the James Bond craze , the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style . Laurie Johnson 's catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today . When Diana Rigg left the series , Linda Thorson entered as John Steed 's new partner Tara King . The series soon went off the air in the United States . It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good . The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting . In any event series definitely left its mark amongst the finest . These DVD copies are gorgeous .	1
Every director and film editor should learn from this series . How such elaborate stories are tautly scripted into 50-minutes TV installments with amazing results is one of the major reasons of the Avengers ' success . One-liners are so skillfully cued to the next scenes that they deliver the desired effect , be it humorous , suspenseful , or any other . Combining mystery , suspense , humor , irony , sci-fi elements , spoofs on spies and villains , playful seduction , the series delivers the perfect , unique mix that not only entertains but stimulates and nourishes the mind . Mrs. Peel , Steed and the other known and unknown guest stars , all deliver their lines and performances with detailed perfection . Seeing Mrs. Peel and Steed interact with each other is a delicious experience . They both remind us that delicate and demured sexuality are eternally most satisfying and stimulating . I estimate that after buying one set of the Avengers you will end up buying them all . On this re-mastered DVD 's format , the Avengers seems so fresh as if filmed today .	1
This 3 episode Avenger 's dvd has it all ! Danger addicts , kinky Hellfire Club worshipers and a real hoot about What the Butler Saw . Steed and Mrs. Peel are truly tested when they investigate powerful military men who are addicted to life threatening danger , after the war is over , and some very out there devil worshipers . And mystery and identity switches as well as spies are a laugh and a gasp a minute . Did the butler do it ? Delightful !	1
Gawd , Do you mean to tell me that VANITY FAIR has been split into 6 videos ? In Australia , the series has been put onto 2 videos with 3 episodes on each tape . Natasha Little is superb in this lavish production and Eleanor Bron is good in her brief appearance in Part 4 .	1
I have only just discovered these BBC adaptations of British classics . Like `` Bleak House '' , the casting and acting in `` Vanity Fair '' are SUPERB , and the sets and costuming out of this world . I envy the first-time viewer !	1
Superior casting , direction , and production values have produced a superior film that stays true to Austen 's classic novel without the excessive cloying `` cutesyfying '' of Gwenyth Paltrow 's depiction of the title role.I am genuinely stunned that there are reviewers here who expressed preference for the Paltrow film ( which is more a parody of `` Clueless '' than anything else . Yes , I understand `` Clueless '' is a modern retelling of `` Emma '' but it is still different in several pertinent ways . ) Beckinsale 's portrayal is EXACTLY how I would expect Emma Woodhouse to look and behave if she were a living breathing person.Thank A & E for giving us a `` real '' Emma .	1
It took me about a year to read Emma ... or at least it felt that long . I had decided to download it for my Mom 's and later my own Kindle , after seeing much of the BBC version which aired on PBS . This A & E film helped me to visualize the story . Everything goes faster without feeling rushed.Emma is the funny and thoughtful tale of a matchmaker who can not make right matches and needs to learn how to understand her own heart . Her father sees the risks in everything , and is not fond of people going away and/or getting married . He is well portrayed here , just as funny ( wish he had more time in the movie ) .Mr . Knightly seemed a bit too forceful . His moods were too extreme and did not seem as real as in the novel . The balls were the best part ... the dances were amazing and the music lovely . In the book the dances were drab but in the movie they came to life.I also liked the fun daydream scenes . It did feel a bit stiff at times and the gypsie scene left me thinking , but overall this film was entertaining .	1
Excellent Jane austin movieI had seen all of the movies here in the Jane Austen 's setso knew I would enjoy itWhen I am down I just put in Jane Austin Movie and will feel better by the end of the movievery good acting and english sceneryHer stories are the best to watchwill watch it over and overchfancier	1
My very first Jane Austen movie was Emma , bought on Ebay in VHS and I watched it over and over . Kate Beckinsale is an excellent Emma . Mr. Knightly is a favorite in this portrayal . Handsome but compassionate . Emma overrates her abilities as a matchmaker after the marriage of her governess and a nearby gentleman and attempts a second which turns into disaster . There is so much action in this story which has a great secret at its heart . Although it is more condensed than the Emma in my Jane Austen Collection , it is bright , colorful and the story flows well . It is a great addition to any Austen collection .	1
This is an entertaining film with actors well-suited for their parts . Our whole family enjoyed it .	1
We love this version of Emma . We 've watched it several times , and enjoy it each time . Definitely would recommend this one !	1
What would you expect ? ... When they promote the Paltrow version with a showy photo of her cocking a bow , and the title , `` Cupid is Armed and Dangerous . `` This version is completely faithful to period detail , speech cadence and to the novel 's plot itself . It 's every bit as good , in fact , as A & E 's `` Pride and Prejudice . '' And , as others have pointed out , it suffered from the hype surrounding the other version.Since Emma 's character is not as overbuilt as it is in the other version , you are free here to enjoy Emma more profoundly , without having to create Emma as a buffoon . It 's much more rewarding to experience this Emma finding love herself . Complete enjoyment !	1
This was a watch over and over friendly adaptation of Emma and captured the book very , very well ! ! In fact , my whole family found it witty , sweet , well adapted . It is colorful and fulfilling . I will be sure to put it next to my favorite Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle , and watch it again often .	1
Excellent movie of the great Austen novel . Kate Beckinsale really nails Emma 's personality . I liked Mark Strong as Mr Knightley , although I will always like Jeremy Northam also . Mark Strong added a dimension of strength to the character of Mr Knightley that was interesting to see . All the actors were superb , the story moved through to a nice conclusion of the Harvest Dinner/announcement of Emma 's engagement which is n't in the book , but seemed to fit . Very nice .	1
I enjoy watching movies set in the English countryside , with the characters in the costumes of the time.This was a pretty good story .	1
I like the movie and watch it several times a week .I wish we had real men like Mr. Knightly..	1
Love amazon movie collections I continue to build up my collection of movies . Just make sure the company your buying from has good reviews and a high score and look to see if they have any major complaints on them . I never had any problems but I always checked there reviews ! Love Jane Austin Movies Five Star Movie	1
This series is very well produced , and very informative . The graphics are excellent , and the narrative is well presented . Highly recommend for family viewing .	1
Another in a long line of astronomical/existential programs that never cease to amaze ! I 'd LOVE to see more programs made available in this this vein of study ...	1
Excellent movie ! Acting was very good.I loved getting to know the historical characters .Movie was well done . One I can watch over and over again	1
Truly excellent films on the Revolutionary War are rare indeed , and this is absolutely one of the very best . While it is a serious , well-filmed story on General Washington 's most challenging times during the war , with plenty of drama built into it , it is very much a factual masterpiece , more than adequately supported at the conclusion by a summary of the lives of the individuals who were most prominently featured in the story . The film carefully built up enduring the dire situation at Valley Forge into culminating with Washington 's famed & # 34 ; Crossing of the Delaware , & # 34 ; no mean logistics feat at the time , and the surprise taking of the British forces at TrentonPerhaps the most powerful aspect of the film is Jeff Daniels ' portrayal of George Washington , during which he once again showed his versatile thespian abilities . I can not think of another contemporary actor who could have played the part more believably . Be assured , the casting organization that selected the rest of the actors did a wonderful job . While some of these are not prominent actors , their selections to those parts , and their deliveries of same were superior .	1
Every American should see this film . They should see , in the dramatic way that a video makes possible , the sacrifices that these earlier people made to give us a free country.I have often marvelled at the patience and tenacity of Washington through those 7 long years of war . This film emphasizes his tenacity and just plain & quot ; toughness. & quot ; It also gives us a picture of those few common soldiers who stayed with him through bitter defeat and privation while the majority deserted or otherwise disappeared . These few made the great difference . And among these few were fewer still the fishermen from Marblehead who saved the Army in New York making possible the escape march to Valley Forge . This same close-knit group of men made the difference again at The Crossing . They knew how to handle boats actually making the crossing possible.As you watch the film listen especially carefully to the conversations between General Washington ( Jeff Daniels ) and Col. John Glover ( Sebastian Roche ) . Col. Glover is the feisty , outspoken officer who often disagrees but who knows how to take orders . He commanded the Marblehead fishermen without whom Valley Forge and the Crossing would never have taken place.If you are interested get Howard Fast 's & quot ; The Unvanguished. & quot ; This book tells the story of the Marblehead fisherman in New York in detail . Fast wrote The Crossing including this film script . With Fast 's earlier New York battle background you will understand how the Army got into such a desperate situation and Washington 's relationship and conversations with Glover in this movie will make all the more sense . .The acting is good to very good . The script is very good . The story moves along well . The settings are realistic and well done . This is no sacrifice . It is real entertainment . But it could inspire you to a little sacrifice for your country should the need arises .	1
This is an incredible and accurate portrayal of Washington 's Crossing the Delaware , and his remarkable defeatof one of the World 's best armies - the Mercenary Hessians - in the 18th Century - from which the Britishnever recovered , and made the first reversal which resulted in victory ! Most important , how General Washingtonliterally got off of his high horse , dared to sit as an equal in a row boat with some of his most common soldiers , and led them to victory ! America needs more & # 34 ; boots-on-the-ground & # 34 ; leadership like this today !	1
Unlike The Patriot which was purely made for propaganda purposes , The Crossing , follows a much more pragmatic , realistic , and in effect a more truthful account of events during the American War of Independence ( 1775-1783 ) . The film brings to the screen George Washington 's first victory during the American Revolution : The Battle of Trenton.It is December 1776 and the Continentals have yet to score a victory against the British . Chased by government forces , the rebels find themselves exhausted on the banks of the Delaware river with General George Washington remaining Commander-in-Chief , but of the now remnants of what used to be the Continental Army ( once numbering 20,000 , now at 2,000 and dwindling ) . Subsequently , Washington is faced with yet another difficult choice : does he camp for the winter and hope that he will still have his rank and an army spring come , or does he surprise-attack the city of Trenton , which is in the hands of 1200 crack German troops from Hessen ? The Crossing provides valuable insight into a very important period of American ( and British ) History . Specifically : We get a taste ( though a very light one ) of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war e.g . when the foundry 's owner refused to let the Continentals use his boats ( before they were in turn confiscated ) .Moreover , we get to see or hear about , the double-crossing generals such as General Lee that allowed himself to be caught ... and yet not so much about the merchants , farmers , and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in , always in search of profit and personal gain , which another film , Benedict Arnold : A Question of Honor , portrays so well.The clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English is not really shown , just the one between the Continentals and the British along with their Hessen allies/mercenaries , which is nonetheless fascinating and very well presented throughout the film ; but then so is the clash within the Continental side ( the undermining , the personality clashes-Washington vs Gates and Lee etc , favoritism-the contingency plan in having Sullivan arrest Lee ) , as well as the problems between Congress and the Army ( there are the subtlest of hints for the latter/Ral 's sword sent to Congress ) .There is also the brave admission ( by G. Washington ) that the Continentals lack public support ( enlistment being at a minimum , while trying to keep their minutemen from deserting ) , and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals `` alive , '' long enough for the French ( 1778 ) , Spaniards ( 1779 ) , and Dutch ( 1780 ) to enter the war against Great Britain , and win the war.Therefore , the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden `` under the carpet . `` As a result , The Crossing , is a daring movie , which shatters more than a few misconceptions , deliberate and not , surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence , and provides for historical truths , which had been suppressed for long years in the name of `` patriotism . `` The only major setback is in relation to Jeff Daniels who is not that great in his role ; Kelsey Grammer was a much better Washington in Benedict Arnold : A Question of Honor.As for the end where it states that : `` The records show that a total of 16,992 Hessians were brought to America to fight the colonists . '' That should be `` ... to fight the rebel colonists , '' not forgetting the Loyalists and the Neutrals made up approximately 1/3 each , of the total colonist populace.In short , The Crossing is a movie definitely worth watching , and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.Strongly recommended , especially for History buffs , along with Revolution starring Al Pacino , and Benedict Arnold : A Question of Honor , starring Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer . 4.5 Stars	1
& quot ; The Crossing & quot ; is one of the finest TV movies ever made . The movie is superbly cast , and led by Jeff Daniels , who surprised me with his outstanding portrayal of George Washington . Why he was n't asked to reprise the role in & quot ; Benedict Arnold , & quot ; I 'll never know ! The crossing of the Delaware River and the Battle of Trenton are created with accuracy and excitement . This is a must-own movie for anyone who enjoys serious films ! Grade : A+	1
`` Regret to Inform '' as some have stated in their reviews here , does , perhaps , have an anti-war bias behind it , but it is n't like it is disguised or anything . The film merely poses these questions : What are the costs of war ? How have women and families been effected by war ? What are the similarities and differences of the experiences that women in America and Vietnam have in regard to the war ? While some may say that pointing out the fact that Vietnam was no direct threat to America , and that the people of Vietnam suffered much more , and their trauma is much more lasting and deeper than those who had the luxury of not having bombs dropped on their neighborhoods , or soldiers accidentally shooting their family members , the fact is that these are truisms that one can not escape.There is an emphasis on those women who were caught on the `` wrong '' side of the conflict , and yes , we do meet some women who fought alongside the Communists , but this is the point . The filmmaker wanted to show what it was like for the people whom we considered the enemy , as well as those who were our own family.The fact that there is no treatment of those who were victimized by their own countrymen is a valid criticism , and it would be nice to see that side of the picture as well.However , the reviewer who dismisses the fact that a couple women that we meet were fighters with the Communists is a moot point . War effects everyone , no matter which side you take . The fact that the tour guide that the woman met in the village where her husband was killed had fought alongside the Communists in that same area was an ironic , and I thought very important part of the film . To leave it out just because she was on the side of the enemy would have been shallow , and not in the spirit of the film.Over 30 years after the war ended for us , we need to go back and see with new eyes the legacy of what we were involved with . Just as with Clint Eastwood 's `` Letters From Iwo Jima '' there comes a time when you need to stop seeing a former enemy , and start seeing fellow human beings who suffered just as you did , regardless of what side they happened to be on .	1
I 'm a university lecturer and have taught classes focusing on the Vietnam War . I 'm also the sister of a Vietnam Vet who died of Agent Orange poisoning . REGRET TO INFORM is one of the best documentaries to be done about that historic period . I 've used this documentary in my college classes , and it has brought many students to tears . It has also affected the soldiers in my classes profoundly . This semester , a young man who just finished his training in the Airforce , said he has been forever changed by the images in this movie and that he understands for the first time what effect war has on civilians . I believe that in looking at Sonneborn 's film , we ALL have to take into account what her purpose was . I do n't find this documentary to be one-sided because Sonneborn achieves what she sets out to do : to connect with other wives and allow them to talk about their pain , hoping to assuage her own pain in the process . She does look at the losses from both sides.Indeed , in her film , war itself is the atrocity . Of course more attention is going to be paid to the consequences of `` The American War '' for the Vietnamese : the war was in their country . Many of them experienced total devastation and wrecked lives , whole families slaughtered . In one heart-wrenching moment , for instance , a Vietnamese woman shares that nearly her entire family was killed before they had a chance to eat breakfast . She weeps for them , even to this day.The gift of this movie is that it shows the extent to which these women have reconciled their lives with the pain of war , and it shows the power of forgiveness . At one point , Sonneborn encounters the people who may very well have been responsible for the death of her husband , yet she treats them with dignity and respect , participates in a solemn ceremony with them for all that has been lost . Moreover , Sonneborn HAS to focus on the brutality of American troops because her own husband acknowledged it and tried to make humanistic choices in the face of all the confusion that was Vietnam . The other American women in this film have to face up to the fact that their husbands might have committed brutal acts.One of the reasons this acknowledgment of American brutality is so important is that young people today do n't understand that Americans are capable of it : they think we 're more moral than others . To illustrate : one of my students thought the Vietnamese had invented and sprayed Agent Orange ! Until Americans face the fact that we are no better nor any worse than any other human being , we will be victims of our own hypocrisy and fail to grow as individuals and as a nation .	1
Having read most of the reviews here and on other websites , there seems to be 3 main groups of people checking out this DVD set.1 . Those who love the books and want to see an adaptation of the books.2 . Those who loved the 1982 version ( with Andrews and Seymour ) and want to see more of that.3 . Those interested in seeing the work of Grant , Shaw , Vibert or McGovern.Group 1 is generally sorely disappointed . This version changes the main character of Percy in ways that will be highly discomforting : he uses minimal disquises , he kills people willy-nilly , he uses Bond-esque gadgets instead of wit and cunning , small things like that . Not to mention , some well loved league members are killed off for no reason . To see a hilarious list of grievances from Group 1 go to : [ ... ] Group 2 is generally disappointed too . That whole love affair/courtship thing between Percy and Marguerite is missing here . # 1 of this DVD starts right off with Percy giving Marguerite the cold shoulder after their marriage . Group 2 is also upset by the change in Percy ( that no disguises and murdering bit ) . And then Elizabeth McGovern is not as beautiful ( or animated or witty ) as Jane Seymour and many in Group 2 are bothered by that . Group 2 absolutely ADORES Anthony Andrews as Percy , and Grant is n't Andrews.Group 3 generally really like this DVD set -- especially if they are not burdened by preconceptions of this famous literary story . However , Group 3 is likely to be a little lost in the beginning . Note : Percy and Marguerite were madly in love with each other before getting married ( you wo n't believe this when you see the first DVD , but it 's true ) . On the wedding night , he receives information that she has betrayed some aristocrats . But he does n't talk with her to find out what really happened . That 's why their marriage is in need of counseling at the beginning of DVD # 1.When you read the reviews ( many from folks in Group 1 and 2 ) , you 'll get the impression the acting drags and the screenplay is boring . This is NOT the case ( well , not in # 1 and # 3 ) . Personnally I enjoy the tongue-in-cheek take on the Scarlet Pimpernel ; the fact that this Pimpernel kills loads of people ( ! ) and walks around in English clothing ( ! ) is hilarious . Richard Grant has a lot of fun with his role ; I like him more and more each time I see these DVDs . Also Shaw and Vibert plus numerous supporting cast give excellent performances ( Shaw in particular is my favorite ) , the costumes and settings are GREAT , and the script is well-moving and entertaining ( especially in # 1 and # 3 at least ) .	1
Clearly , Baroness Orczy 's original fictional character , & quot ; The Scarlet Pimpernel & quot ; , and film adaptations such as the 1934 version starring Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon , each stand alone . The 1998 BBC/A & amp ; E co-production is neither docudrama nor a faithful reproduction of the original works -- it is a new interpretation of a favourite fictional character set in the French Revolution . Much criticism of this miniseries is ungenerous , and misses many of its finer points -- in addition , in one case , to confusing Elizabeth McGovern with Elizabeth Montgomery.This is a very long piece of work -- far exceeding Hitchcock 's famous bladder test , if any zealot is contemplating a viewing in one sitting . That box contains five hours of viewing on three DVDs ! Yet it sustains its high production values and story interest throughout , and is unusual among miniseries for doing so . Glorious locations in the Czech Republic ; sumptuous , moody and squalid interiors as required ; and first class costuming and property department , are combined with superb direction , photography , editing , sound , and acting.Elizabeth McGovern is physically not the first actress one would think of casting as Lady Marguerite Blakeney . But like the highly skilled stage actress she is , Ms McGovern carries her role less on appearance than on technique . She weaves a credible romantic characterisation based on shared experience , intrigue , intellectual respect , and even a bit of physicality . She is well-matched with a strong cast also rich in stage background , including Richard E. Grant in the title role , Martin Shaw as the ruthless and complex Chauvelin , Ronan Vibert as Robespierre , and many other fine performers. & quot ; The Scarlet Pimpernel & quot ; ( 1998 ) boxed set is fantastic value , comparable as a high quality costume drama to only one other miniseries currently in DVD , & quot ; The Count Of Monte Cristo & quot ; ( 1999 ) with Gerard Depardieu . If you saw and liked them on TV , they are even better on DVD .	1
Perfect when you want to watch something that takes you to a different time and place ... romantic , exciting , idealistic , arch and classic .	1
You like the civil war ? You like watching a civil war documentary and being able NOT to fall asleep ? Do yourself a favor and buy this .	1
What a way to celebrate the 150th years of the Civil War . The DVD 's add to the knowledge of the great conflict .	1
The premise with this History Channel series is to tell specific battle history while showing ( through re-enactment ) what the engagements really looked like ... and this DVD set hits the ball right out of the park ! Watching the battles at Antietam , Gettysburg , Shiloh and ( my favorite ) Cold Harbor on the actual battlefield is phenominal ... it really adds so much to the narration that you actually get the & quot ; feel & quot ; of being right in the middle of the conflict . Each battle covers sufficient detail that the story of the & quot ; everyday & quot ; soldier gets told along with much & quot ; new & quot ; information that makes this DVD unique ( for example ... on the Fredricksburg episode , the little known story of the Confederate private who risks life and limb by going onto the battlefield to help the injured is a featured part of the story but these are details that I could n't find in books from Foote , Catton or the excellent volume on Fredricksburg by George Rable ) . The narration also includes & quot ; expert & quot ; analysis from noted historians and authors ( Gordon Rhea in the trenches at Cold Harbor ... ) that add additional perspective to the storyline . The battle stories are about 1 hour long and each stands on it 's own so that you can stop at reasonable intervals without missing anything . Overall this is essential Civil War viewing for the historian but still presents itself well enough for the general viewer so that all viewers should get great enjoyment from watching ... highest recommendation !	1
I like the color film documentaries and this one is very satisfying . The footage is pretty good and includes many scenes I have never seen before . If youre a fan of the color film documentaries of WWII , this one should be in your collection .	1
World War II -- The Lost Color Archives gives people a rare opportunity to essentially witness World War II as it actually looked in color . The quality of the color footage varies at times but it certainly gives you the feeling that you were there much more than if you were to watch the same footage shot only in black and white . The quality of the sound is excellent . Thank goodness for the History Channel from which this program comes ! The first of the two DVDs contains color films of events beginning at about the time of The Spanish Civil War and the coronation of a new King ( George ) in Great Britain . We witness footage of English statesmen actually visiting amicably with Hitler ; Hitler sure had them fooled ! There is interesting footage of great historical value concerning the German invasions of countries like Poland and The Soviet Union ; and we also see the horrifying color footage of the fires in London during the German bombing of the city.The first DVD also includes footage of the fight in the Pacific ; we see our men fighting to capture islands in the Pacific that could be sued as bases for important military maneuvers including the Enola Gay flight that would drop `` the bomb '' on Japan.In addition , there is color footage of the brutal Wausau ghetto where Jews were housed like cattle and children were left as orphans on the streets to die . The brutal treatment of the Jews and other Nazi atrocities are made very clear throughout the course of this two DVD set.The second DVD gives us footage of the last year and one-half of the war . We see D Day , the rescue of France , other countries , and the people in concentration camps from brutal German occupation and the gradual erosion of Hitler 's German military machine . The footage continues to show us a great deal of bombing , damage from bombing and carnage . It 's truly fascinating to watch World War II in color.The DVDs have some extras on the second of the two DVDs . What we get is mostly more color footage that was not used for the actual program of World War II in color . There is footage of Hitler and the elite guards at his country estate and we get great footage of Americans fighting their best . We see more footage of fires raging through destroyed cities -- and more . This is excellent bonus footage and it lasts about twenty minutes.Overall , I highly recommend this two DVD package for history buffs , military buffs and veterans of World War II . This color footage is actually quite rare and I believe that it has great historical significance .	1
This set contains two later adaptations of Agatha Christie novels . The second , Lord Edgware Dies , is an adequate , though not great , telling of the story . As always , Suchet is superb as Poirot.Unfortunately , The Murder of Roger Ackroyd misses the mark . The producers evidently did not understand the original novel either in its style of presentation , nor in its historical significance . While not well known today , this novel when first published aroused a storm of protest from within the mystery writing community . The only mystery writer who came to Christie 's defense was Dorothy Sayers . The others did not understand the novel , which changed everything about the way mysteries are presented.Sadly , the producers of this edition did not understand the novel , either . We still await an adequate adaption of this wonderful work into a faithful film presentation .	1
`` The Murder of Roger Ackroyd '' and `` Lord Edgware Dies '' brought `` Agatha Christie 's Poirot '' back from a 4-year hiatus in 2000 . The two feature-length films constitute Series 7 of the long-running detective series starring David Suchet as the fussy Belgian sleuth . Hercule Poirot 's frequent partners in detection -Capt . Arthur Hastings , Miss Lemon , and Chief Inspector Japp- are also back , though Hastings is visibly older , and Miss Lemon is inexplicably a brunette . These episodes had especially accomplished screenwriters : Clive Exton , who was responsible for so much of the series ' early success , and Anthony Horowitz . At this point , the filmmakers still had a fondness for modernist architecture , which I love . They did an admirable job of resurrecting `` Poirot '' after 4 years , as did the cast . Unlike the earlier Acorn releases , these A & E ; DVDs have no bonus features . The films are : '' The Murder of Roger Ackroyd '' finds Poirot retired from detective work and seeking peace and quiet in the village of King 's Abbott , where he is becoming frustrated with his vegetable garden 's inability to produce fruit of sufficient grandeur . He becomes concerned about his friend Roger Ackroyd ( Malcolm Terris ) , a chemical magnate , after Ackroyd 's paramour Mrs. Dorothy Farrars ( Rosalind Bailey ) dies of apparent suicide . Ackroyd had learned that someone was blackmailing Dorothy over the suspicious death of her late husband . He intends to find the culprit , but the culprit finds him first . Upset by his failure to save his friend 's life , Poirot must navigate a cast of lying suspects -Roger 's sister-in-law , niece , stepson , who will profit from his death , his secretary , butler , parlor maid , town gossip , and an affable country doctor- to find the murderer.For `` Lord Edgware Dies '' , Poirot is back in London and hard at work after a brief retirement . Capt . Arthur Hastings ( Hugh Fraser ) , who has married and returned to London from Argentina , joins his old friend in sleuthing once again . The pair meet the comely actress Jane Wilkensen ( Helen Grace ) at a performance by American impersonator Carlotta Adams ( Fiona Allen ) . Jane asks Poirot to convince her husband , the abrasive Lord Edgware ( John Castle ) , to grant her a divorce . But while Poirot , Hastings , Miss Lemon ( Pauline Moran ) , and Chief Inspector Japp ( Philip Jackson ) have a reunion dinner , and Jane Wilkensen dines with friends , someone who looks a lot like Jane stabs Lord Edgware to death in his study . This murderer is particularly diabolical , leaving Poirot frustrated by a long list of unanswered questions .	1
I enjoy Dr Quinn The Medicine Woman . Warms the heart . Very realistic movie . Jane Seymour and Joe Lando do a great job . I will be collecting all of these movies . My mother loved them and so do I. I would certainly refer them to a friend . I am a caregiver and they enjoy watching them with me as well . Johnnie Oxner	1
Upstairs , Downstairs,1971-1975,68 episodes,5 seasons . Time period covered 1903-1930.Setting:165 Eaton Place , London , England.Favourite actress : Jean March ( Rose Buck ) .I watched Upstairs , Downstairs on PBS in the mid 70 's and again when it reaired in the 90 's . This box set is worth the money . Now I can watch all the episodes and behind the scenes extras . ( When I bought my set , I received the reboot of the series,2010 edition , as a bonus.Setting:1936 , still at 165 Eaton Place.Jean March reprises her role . The first season was the best , the second season,2 years later , was not as good but still watchable . Jean had a stroke so she only made 2 appearances ) .This is the the original Downton Abbey .	1
This is absolutely a wonderful series . Truly one of the best ever . It 's also a bargain , as the entire series on VHS cost just under $ 1,000 . Having just studied U.S. History in the period the series covers I understood even better just how well the producers and writers interwove real life events in with the stories of their characters , and best of all the characters are flawed and real and loveable and even gently amusing . While there are some episodes ( The Swedish Tiger ) and some characters ( Sarah ) that I 've never particularly liked , the series as a whole is superb . ( And as for video quality people are complaining about here , I do n't get it , as I 've only ever seen Up/Down on PBS and VHS copies from PBS and this looks just as it always did . ) Do n't let this even bother you . The series is worth it .	1
I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we began watching it shortly thereafter . Initially I was discouraged with it because the first episodes are terrible . But my wife persisted and after six to eight episodes it began to get considerably better . Within ten episodes we were enjoying it a great deal . I think it was because the first episodes were lacking in pathos and charm , the writers trying to keep things a bit dark like an American soap opera . But when they gave that up it took on a life and personality of its own . The first segments ( which were filmed in black and white ) also had a stagey quality almost like burlesque where the actors overact to convey their emotions over great distances ( unnecessary on the small screen obviously ) . I also had trouble with the son , whom I do n't think is quite as strong an actor as the others ( such as the actor who plays the butler Hudson , who is excellent ) but he gets better as the series progresses.Other actors come and go making a slow but steady evolution toward a very enjoyable ensemble series .	1
I remember hearing about this series when I was a kid . Probably during the original US run in the 70 's . I think they reran it after that . I can remember watching part of one episode , but it did n't appeal to me . Well , maybe I was too young to appreciate it.Fast forward to a few months ago . Now middle aged , I decided to give this series another try . At first , it seemed OK , but I was n't sure if I 'd want to spend the time getting through the whole series . Did n't seem quite as well done as more recent British TV . But , I watched a few more episodes and got more interested . Before I knew it , I was on the 5th and last series and realized I was almost done . I was sad to see the last episode end . The characters seemed almost like old friends by then.I think the first episode is set in 1903 and the last in 1930 . Many characters come and go , but many appear in the whole run like Mr. Hudson , Mrs. Bridges , Rose and Richard Bellamy.The British class system in all its & # 34 ; glory & # 34 ; is illustrated as the series rolls on . And how it starts to unravel a bit as time moves forward . I guess as an American , it is hard to believe how those lower on the food chain put up with this system , but I guess we had something similar at the time here , but maybe less rigid . I 'm told that the British still retain a bit of the old system even today , while we seem to have been a little more successful at getting rid of our old system.But , I think one positive point that is often overlooked about the old system is well illustrated . There was some sense of family ties of a sort between the upstairs family and the long time servants downstairs.The series did try to bring to life the big events going on at the time the series is set . It also showed how the upstairs people and the servants saw these events in very similar ways in many cases . I was surprised at how the servants were so often in agreement with the upstairs people on politics . Maybe they all valued stability and tradition very much and so agreed on the politics as a result.Sometimes the formality of the interactions between the upstairs folk and the servants was almost comical , but it was still kind of nice to see it at times . We seem to live in a world without much in the way of good manners anymore.I 'm sure that much has been written on the details of the series already by other reviewers , so I do n't think there is much I could add there . So , I 'll just say that this is a great series to watch and well worth the time required to watch all the episodes.There was a continuation series that aired recently which I did watch well before I got far along in the old series reviewed here . They do n't seem all that related to me now that I have seen all of both . The new series was not very popular and did n't last very long . Two short seasons maybe . I thought it was OK .	1
It really does . OK , it was filmed forty years ago , so the odd wobbly wall etc , but if you do n't fall in love with the well-written characters and evocation of Edwardian London you are not human .	1

But even war fails to change some things , like scandal , family disgrace , celebrations , and again the outstanding drama series Emmy and the prestigious Peabody Award.After the airing of `` The Forsyte Saga '' ( a must series also ) , Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the `` Upstairs Downstairs '' concept . Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster , and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV ( Dec '10 ) . 3 episodes advance the story now to 1936 , with a new cast ( excepting Marsh ) and also now including Atkins as Maud , the same house , same music , same title . After `` Upstairs Downstairs '' the pair of actresses combined again in creating `` The House of Eliott '' , another period saga , bloody good Brit drama , an absolute must own `` complete collection . `` There you have my lengthy opinion , but so much in this anniversary edition . Worth the price . My final recommendation : BUY `` Upstairs Downstairs 40th Anniversary Ed '' , `` The Forsyte Sage '' , and `` the House of Eliott . ''	1
Upstairs Downstairs is the example par excellence of British television . Over five seasons during the 1970s , Upstairs Downstairs riveted audiences in Britain , while in America , it more than any other series made Masterpiece Theater an essential part of Sunday evening television.Upstairs Downstairs is the story of the Bellamy family of 165 Eaton Place , London from about 1903 to 1930 . The Bellamys are an aristocratic family with a houseful of servants . The interplay of story line and personality between Upstairs ( the Bellamys and their friends and relatives ) and Downstairs ( the assorted servants ) was beautifully done . Some of the episodes tended to be a bit too soap operaish , but at its best the series was utterly spellbinding and memorable.This megaset contains every episode of the original five seasons . Some of the transfers are not all that clear , and a few of the openings have been truncated or even omitted entirely . The megaset also contains a spin off of the series , Thomas and Sarah , based on the lives of two of the servants after they left 165 . Thomas and Sarah has nowhere near the quality of the original series and does not , in my opinion , deserve to be grouped with it . But nevertheless this megaset is the best way to obtain and enjoy Upstairs Downstairs today .	1
Upstairs , Downstairs : The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary CollectionThis is just about the finest series from England in the past 2 0r 3 decades . The telling of the Bellamy Family over many years beginning when servents truly ran the home from Downstairs . If you have never seen this original series you are in for a treat . I bought the VHS version when it came out and now bought the DVD collection . Everything from the clothing to the furnishings to the timely activities take you over many years and many relationships . You will laugh , cry , be happy and sometimes sad as things change . You will get to know dozens of people and leard of their whims , their heartbreak , and their places all intertwine from Upstairs to Downstairs .	1
Let me first begin by saying that I remember watching Up/Down when it first aired 40 years ago , as a then vulnerable and impressionable young lass of 17 . I enjoyed the show immensely , it was really rather a first offering of PBS , then known primarily as a fledgling `` artsy '' station , presenting this hitherto unknown British series through WGBH in Boston . From its first episode , Up/Down oozed quality in every way : superb acting , writing , direction , production , with the added bonus of Alistair Cooke 's introduction , while seated in a leather armchair next to a roaring fire prior to each episode , to the accompaniment of the famous Masterpiece Theatre theme , Mouret 's Rondo , which added to the understated elegance and anticipation of each episode.The characters of Up/Down were many faceted and always interesting , not merely presented as one-dimensional , i.e. , rich versus poor . One could even sympathize with the clueless and wealthy Bellamy family on occasion , theirs was a cocoon of privilege and comfort , yet their breeding never eschewed vulgarity or crassness , but embraced kindness , concern and responsible humanity toward their Downstairs `` family '' . Similarly , their Downstairs family , in turn , showed respect , warm feelings of pride of service and true concern for their `` upstairs '' family as well . The viewer was entwined in the lives of both `` families '' , experiencing their joys , sorrows and frustrations . All within a 25 year framework encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian ages , culminating in the death of Edward VII , the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Lady Marjorie Bellamy , World War I and its aftermath , the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression , forever changing the world of the Bellamys first shown in 1904 . Up/Down is , simply , a breathtakingly unforgettable series.This 40th anniversary release is equal to the many superlatives written on these pages of reviews . I had VHS taped some of the original Up/Down episodes when they were re-shown on PBS in the 80 's , which I still have . However , I wanted the DVD version , and decided to purchase this 40th anniversary set through Amazon . Let me say that it is simply superb in every way.The episodes have been remastered to splendid effect , they are all excellent in both video and audio quality . I do not understand how some of the reviewers could state that they are not ! They are all exceptionally good . There are 21 DVD 's in this set , with an added 25 hours of extras , narrating the making of Up/Down , interviews with many of the characters who are still living , and they seem to enjoy reminiscing , sharing many little unknown facts about the particular episodes being presented . Priceless . There are also narratives and commentaries in the episodes by some of the actors , scene selection , and an enclosed brief written narrative by Jean Marsh , one of the co-creators who also portrayed Rose , the under-house parlor maid . The audio commentaries by the actors and writers on each episode are great fun , listening to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams ' comments give one a marvelous insider perspective . This is the definitive collection , it just does n't get much better than this . I urge all Up/Down devotees , new and old , to purchase it . Also , the price on Amazon is about the lowest I have seen anywhere . It is well worth the price for this timeless and iconic series , presented as grandly as the series itself . Do n't miss it .	1
Life for servants and upper class in turn of the century England . Contains quite a bit of history and different sides of political issues . My favorite soap opera and show of all time .	1
Heard about this series all my life ... finally bought it..and have problems understanding dialog ... .cast seems to mumble at times ... and at others , talk so fast with the British accent that this Southern gal has problems hearing/unstanding dialog . love the cast ... but am tired of `` backing up '' trying to get the gyst of the script	1
we all like to nosey in to others ' business and this gives us the perfect opportunity ; I admit I enjoyed it.Unfortunately the set I got had alot of background noise on it , but I muddled through regardless !	1
We wondered what all the fuss was about . A forty year old series ? ! The quaint black and white pictures and simplistic sets in the first episodes recede from your consciousness as the stories draw you in . Before long , you have a vested interest in the lives of these people and the history they are living becomes vivid - and feels current . We missed them when we finished viewing and will watch it again .	1
I suppose every Mel Brooks ' fan has seen these films . What a catalog he has produced/directed/screen-written/song-written/ starred in , etcetera.THIS Blu-ray collection is slightly different from the [ costlier ] previous ones . It does NOT include the covetted 119 page hardback book ... or , several films from OTHER studios.THESE are 20th Century Fox Films.Other films , The Producers ( Collector 's Edition ) , [ BluRay/DVD Combo ] [ Blu-ray ] , and a silly-favorite of mineDracula : Dead and Loving It -- -to name but a few -- - are not included as they 're from different studios.Okay , so this costs less than $ 140 . THAT , alone , made me want to upgrade my old VHS/LVD/DVDs.This collection includes Commentaries ; Interviews ; Documentries ; Still galleries ; and more on selected films , and7 archive featurettes6 Blu-Ray -- - exclussive -- - featurettes5 Isolated Music Score Sound Tracks4 Trivia Tracks -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Includes the following -- - { but , in BLU-RAY } : The Mel Brooks Collection ( Blazing Saddles / Young Frankenstein / Silent Movie / Robin Hood : Men in Tights / To Be or Not to Be / History of the World , Part 1 / The Twelve Chairs / High Anxiety ) andSpaceballs ( 25th Anniversary Edition ) [ Blu-ray ] These are films we either DID N'T -- - or DID -- - `` grow up '' with .

This is a great collection of many of Mel brooks best movies . I was not familiar with `` Silent Movie '' of `` 12 Chairs '' before I purchased this set but found the inclusion of them to be a nice rounding out of Mel 's style . None of the movies include much by the way of special features if you look for that type of things . The packaging is nothing special but does n't get in the way of a good product and does n't feel like it will fall apart after a year or two either . I would n't pay full retail but would buy this again for the right price .	1
Mel Brooks has a controversial kind of humour , either you like it or you hate it.This compilation contains Mel Brooks ` interpretation of famous movie milestones of the last century , most of them having become milestones themselves.From the master of reinterpretation and anachronisms . The more movie classics you have seen , the more you will laugh watching these delightfully funny parodies and parabels .	1
Mel Brooks is a master as satire and comedy . This is the perfect way to have all his best films in one place .	1
one of the best commedie movies made by him i love them all blazing saddles was the best bring more .	1
I 'm a HUGE Mel Brooks fan ( it 's a Y chromosome thing , I suspect ) , and when this came up on lightning deals , I jumped on it . All my favorite classics are included in incredible transfers - and there was even one I had n't seen ( twelve chairs ) .Well packaged , and like I said , very good transfers of the films . DEFINITELY recommended for the Y chromosome challenged .	1
I got this for $ 27ish when it was Amazon 's Deal of the Day . What a steal . The movies are great and it had all my favorites .	1
I had n't seen some of these movies in years and I had n't ever seen them looking like this . 9 movies for under 30 with gold box deal . Some people complain that most of these were n't originally widescreen . OK . But I do n't watch Mel Brooks for the perfect film quality . They look much better than when I saw them on a 20 inch tube TV with commercials . In fact , they look really good considering how old they are . If you have n't seen his movies , you are missing a treat . Brooks is an original . I 've been watching these with my 13 year old and getting a new generation hooked on Mel Brooks . They are a little racy for kids , but whatever . I still remember watching Blazing Saddles in the movie theater with my dad . He used to quote that movie from time to time years later . If my dad was still alive , I would send him this collection !	1
This has been one of my most enjoyed purchases lately . It provides continuous laughs time and time again . Highly recommended .	1
I really have enjoyed the movies and am glad to have obtained it for my collection . You must own it also	1
I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others .	1
It was a present for my daughter , who is a huge Mel Brooks fan . I guess I brought her up right . She loves them and the set includes a couple of movies not commonly seen .	1
I bought these for my husband to replace the VHS versions.. Blu-ray is soooo ... much better . We have been laughing our socks off for past couple of weeks now , re-enjoying these classic favorites.. also some new ones we had never seen . Mel Brooks is a genius ! ! His directing style has never been duplicated that I can tell . Love it ! !	1
A gift for my husband - got all of us watching and enjoying Mel 's creations . Got to say it was a hit .	1
The best of Brooks in Blu . A comedic genius that we will never see again . This is a gem that all lovers of comedy should watch , commit to memory and then watch again !	1
You get 9 films on 9 discs in this collection : Blazing Saddles , Spaceballs , Young Frankenstein , High Anxiety , History of the World Part 1 , Robin Hood : Men in Tights , Silent Movie , To Be or Not To Be , and The Twelve Chairs . Six films are brand new to Blu-ray in this set . Overall , the picture quality is very good but the audio quality is fairly average ( High Anxiety and The Twelve Chairs do n't sound great but otherwise the sound quality is good ) . All the significant special features from the DVD versions have been ported over and there is plenty of exclusive content for fans . There is over 7.5 hours of total bonus content plus 4 audio commentaries ( Twelve Chairs has only a trailer ) . You also get an exclusive 120-page book in this release . My only real complaint is that the packaging is somewhat flimsy.Video Resolution/Codec : 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 ; 1080p/VC-1 ( Blazing Saddles ) | Aspect Ratio : 1.85:1 ; 2.35:1 ; 2.40:1Audio Formats:12 Chairs- English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 , English Mono , French Mono , Spanish Mono , Portuguese MonoHigh Anxiety- English DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 , English Stereo , French Dolby Digital 5.1 , Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 , Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1Silent Movie- English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 , English Mono , French Mono , Spanish MonoHistory of the World : Part I- English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 , English Mono , French Dolby Digital 5.1 , Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 , Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1To Be or Not To Be- English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 , English Mono , French Mono , Spanish Mono , Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1Robin Hood : Men in Tights- English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 , English Stereo , French Stereo , Spanish StereoYoung Frankenstein- English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 , English Mono , Spanish Mono , French MonoSpaceballs- English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 , English Stereo , French DTS 5.1 , German DTS 5.1 , Italian DTS 5.1 , Castillian DTS 5.1 , Hungarian Dolby Digital 5.1 , Latin DTS 5.1 , Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1Blazing Saddles- English Dolby Digital 5.1 , French Mono , Spanish MonoSubtitles/Captions:12 Chairs- English SDH , Spanish , Cantonese , Mandarin , PortugueseHigh Anxiety- English SDH , Cantonese , Korean , Mandarin , PortugueseSilent Movie- English SDH , Spanish , Cantonese , Korean , MandarinHistory of the World : Part I- English SDH , French Text , Spanish , Spanish Text , Portuguese , Portuguese Text , Cantonese , Korean , MandarinTo Be or Not To Be- English SDH , Spanish , Cantonese , Korean , Mandarin , PortugueseRobin Hood : Men in Tights- English SDH , SpanishYoung Frankenstein- English , Spanish , Cantonese , MandarinSpaceballs- English SDH , French , German , Italian , Castillian , Dutch , Danish , Finnish , Norweigan , Swedish , Portuguese , Hungarian , LatinBlazing Saddles- English SDH , English , French , SpanishSpecial Features:4 Audio CommentariesTrailersFeaturettesDeleted Scenes5 Trivia Tracks5 Isolated Score TracksAnxiety TestNewly Recorded Featurettes/RetrospectivesBuy this collection .

Mel Brooks has a habit of either batting it out of the park . Its no surprise when friends/family rate their top ten favorite comedies that SOMETHING of Mel 's ends up on that list . This collection has been on my wish list for a long time . Needless to say when it went on sale , I grabbed it . Do n't get me wrong , I was always planning on purchasing it . The regular price for ALL of these movies is reasonable . But on SALE ? Grabbed fast ! ! ! For those of you only reading this review .. from best to not so good the movies in this collection are ... .1 . Young Frankenstein 2 . Blazing Saddles3 . Spaceballs 4 . History of the World ( Pt . 1 ) 5 . Robin Hood . Men in Tights 6 . High Anxiety7 . To Be or Not To Be 8 . Silent Movie9 . The Twelve Chairs.There are documentaries , interviews and Trivia . There 's a months worth of viewing.Sit back and prepare to laugh .	1
Always loved Mel Brooks from the very first time I saw Blazing Saddles in the early 70 's . This collection is a must for every fan .	1
Where is & # 34 ; Spaceballs ? & # 34 ; Anything else we 're not familiar with ? I do think that & # 34 ; Silent Movie & # 34 ; was too silent . Still , it was wonderful .	1
I love all Mel Brooks movies and this had some of my favorites ! They dont make these types of movies anymore , which makes this collection unique .	1
The purpose of this review is simply to clarify that the original 2009 release of this collection on Blu-Ray came in a large box and included a lavish hardcover book . Thus the reviews complaining that the oversize package is hard to store.The set has recently been re-released at a substantially lower price , packaged in a 9-disk blue plastic case of standard height and width , sans the book . Instead there is a simple 16-page pamphlet tucked into the front cover.The discs and extras are the same as the first release . `` The Producers '' is still not included because it 's still not distributed by Fox , as are the 9 included titles .	1
I have always loved Mel Brooks ' films , and I have wanted this collection for some time . I was not disappointed . I had several of the films on DVD , but it is nice to have them all in one nice thin package on Blu-ray . The sound , picture , and bonus features are all excellent . I am not disappointed in the least !	1
The Mel Brooks Collection is a great set . it contains almost ALL of his directed movies . The Twelve Chairs , Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein , Silent Movie , High Anxiety , History of the World : Part 1 , To Be or Not To Be , SpaceBalls , and Robin Hood : Men in Tights . This set does not contain The Producers ( 1968 ) or Dracula Dead and Loving it ( 1995 ) though nither of those are available on seperate blu-ray anyway .	1
Great box set ! Gave it 4 stars because it was only discs . no booklets or anything else . but the price was awsome when I got it so made it worth it	1
There is not much to say about these two movies that has not been said a million times . John Hughes has us laughing till our side 's hurt in the 80 's and the 90 's and this one is no exception . Unlike most other & # 34 ; lie rays & # 34 ; the digital conversion of these two films was top notch and went well beyond just simple video noise reduction and the restored to 5.1 original soundtrack will blow you out of you seat ! A must have for any video collection as it will entertain the young and the old .	1
I grew up watching these every Thanksgiving with my cousins and brother . Doesnt seem the same without watching these . Great movies . Classics .	1
One if the best ever ! funny , funny , funny , I think this has to go down as one if the Classics of its time ! Great Comedy !	1
It 's silly slapstick humor but a classic in it 's own right . The double set was a welcomed present for a friend to celebrate the holidays . Great music , good chuckles throughout and of course some effective slapstick that makes you go & # 34 ; ow ! & # 34 ; .	1
Love having these two BluRays , as far as I 'm concerned there was no part 3 , extra features are a one time watch but love watching these around Christmas	1
They just do n't make movies like this anymore . Both are hilarious . I feel bad for the kids who did n't grow up watching this movie .	1
Bought this to add to our holiday collection of Christmas movies and watched it several times . Forgot how funny it was	1
Great movies ; classics at this point as hard as that is to believe . Gives you a merry feeling . I would surely recommend these movies to anyone .	1
I have these in DVD , but for this price , could n't pass up the upgrade to Blu ray . Love these movies .	1
I guess it 's old enough to be a classic . This one has always made me laugh . If you like laughs , buy it .	1
Good , fun , classic Christmas movie . Seen it lots of times , still laugh each time . If you do n't know the story , then watch it . If you have seen it before , watch it again .	1
I have never had Home Alone on blu Ray before . They had both great picture and sound . Good holiday movies to own .	1
who does n't like this classic movie , this is a great movie to watch when company is over for the holidays .	1
Actually this is more or less a good whole some family movie for my library collect from my past history	1
One of my family 's favorite Christmas movies . I had to get this and on Bluray great price and one we will watch every year	1
I just picked up this set from a local brick and mortar chain . I see a lot of negative opinions about Home Alone 2 in particular . Some reviewers have even said that their old DVD copy looks better than the blu-ray . I watched it last night and found no problems with the picture quality whatsoever . I noticed a vast improvement in the detail over my old DVD copy . But I do n't know if I got a newer set or what , but the product I purchased has different artwork on the carboard sleeve as well as the the individual inserts for the disc cases . Also they have a 2013 release date on them . I ca n't find pictures of a set with the same artwork anywhere except on an import copy , but that artwork has english and foreign language print on it , mine only has english . So I do n't know if I 've gotten newly released and remastered discs or this is the same set with new artwork . But it 's odd I ca n't find any pictures of a US release with this artwork on it anywhere . I might upload some pics later . For now I will upload the pic I found of the import.EDIT 11/14/13 - I see Amazon has added a photo for the updated art on the slipcover . Anybody else get the ones with the new artwork ?	1
I first heard about this film on Siskel & Ebert ; and I wanted to see it . My brother found it in a small video store and rented it for me . This may very well be one of the most dark , depressing , and brilliant films I have ever seen.It 's directed by Gary Oldman ( known for his acting , or overacting , in Dracula , The Professional etc , ) and he proves to be a great director . The movie is about a family with Ray Winstone as Ray , the father/husband of the household and Kathy Burke as Valerie . Ray is a working class lout who abuses both drugs and his wife . His son Billy ( played by Charlie Creed-Miles ) is a herion addict on the streets after his father nearly bites his nose off for stealing his smack . Ray is at times both scary and pittiful , mean and sad , nasty and pathetic . He intertwines these roles so well that at time 's you ca n't tell where he is coming from , or what he 'll do next . Valerie is just a simple wife who is just trying to keep her head down so she does n't get it taken off . However even she is not imune to Ray 's violent temper over nothing . In one very vicious scene she is attacked by Ray and although the beating take 's place off-camera it still sends chills.I must warn anyone who wants to watch this movie the it contains more bad language that any I have ever seen ( like Pulp Fiction , Scarface , or even South Park ) but the profanity only hightens the dread at times . It also looks at life in a very dark way . This is not a happy movie by any means and Oldman has produced a real masterpiece . This has great acting and real good timing between the actors . This is quite simply one of the best movies I have ever seen .	1
This is an excellent movie for anyone that truly enjoyed the sounds of disco . The highlight was Donna Summer but one ca n't forget the Commodores . It is a purely entertaining , do n't have to think or search for true meaning movie that wo n't change your world but may lighten it if only for a little while .	1
A very cute little movie . Purchased because I am a big Donna Summer fan . She really only has a co-star role here , but it is good .	1
This film is so frightening because one can imagine these things actually happening . I needed to watch the film twice before I got it all . Basically , two corporate men decide to date a wallflower for six weeks and then dump her , breaking her heart in the most cruel way , essentially getting revenge on all of womankind for past wrongs . In this case , the wallflower is a deaf girl who is a typist in a very bleak corporate office the two men are sent to work in for six weeks . This film is so cleverly written that there were moments ( the first time I watched it ) when I felt that Chad ( the handsome one ) was actually falling for this poor girl but at the end , and then on the second viewing , I realized that he was just planting the idea that he might really have feelings for this girl in his co-worker 's mind in order to manipulate him ( that would be Howard - the less handsome one ) . Making Howard believe that he might really have feelings for this deaf woman only made her more desirable ( to Howard ) - male competition in play . I also felt that he was trying to undermine Howard 's authority as his boss because of his jealousy - needing to sabotage that aspect as well . Though some elements of the film are cliche ( the girl falls for the good-looking one of course , then the nerdy one has a breakdown ) , these things , again , actually happen in real life ( I know a lot of women who would choose a macho handsome guy over a sensitive nerdy guy just on looks alone - the same as a man picking a beautiful woman with a so-so personality over an average-looking woman who is really smart ) . Though most viewers feel really bad for this woman , she actually played her own game by dating both men simultaneously even after telling Chad that she loved him . She reasons that after not dating for a long time , she liked the attention - it made her feel attractive again . Some people feel bad for Howard but really , he was n't in love with this girl either though he may have thought so - it was just beating Chad ( and being on the rebound ) that drove his competitive side to move forward so aggressively . I mean , after dating her for a few weeks , he gives her a used engagement ring and then freaks out telling her that it was all a game when she rejects him . If he really loved and wanted her , he would have tried to protect her from the truth ( instead , he uses it as a weapon against her almost as if he is punishing her for the way his former fiance treated him . It seemed to me that he was subconsciouly getting revenge on his former fiance through this woman - that she had in essence become the fiance that rejected him and so the game actually did what it set out to do ) . Theories like `` what goes around comes around '' do n't apply here and the most disturbing thing about this movie is the reality that what goes around does n't always come around especially in Chad 's case - that he lies , plots , schemes and destroys with no repercussions . In the end , he goes home to his beautiful apartment , his beautiful girlfriend , his great job and everything is as it ever was . And sadly , that 's real life .	1
The Bottom Line : In the Company of Men does n't always have the most innovative direction or impressive production values , but it 's exceptionally well-written and acted , telling a story of evil all the more persuasively for its lack of gunfights and long-winded speeches ; a rather harrowing movie that has lost little in the decade since its release , ItCoM will get under your skin and stay there .	1
I believe the use of a deaf woman is symbolism for women who are vulnerable & who do not really hear what they are hearing from men . She 's symbolic also for any women who have been made to feel less-than by society for any physical reasons , or from any emotional/spiritual abuse from family or previous relationships , resulting in them being vulnerable to manipulation . The first 20 minutes or so , is slow & rough , but then it gets funny ( to me ) and then it gets twisted , so I suggest sticking with it . It 's a good learning lesson for a movie . These people do exist and they are n't all men . The female counterpart to this movie is `` The Shape of Things '' also from the talented Neil LaBute , who has been recently involved with Hell On Wheels , a great show on AMC . I will be waiting to see what new work Mr.LaBute sends us .	1
Why is Chad so frightening ? Because Society is full of Chads . Around every corner there is some version of Chad : a cruel , unscrupulous , good-looking , highly intelligent person along his lines , who will not only NOT get what 's coming to him , but through guile , hypocrisy and ruthlessness rise and devour . In addition , elements of Chad exist in almost everyone , male or female , which if given a chance to operate without personal cost , will always tend to assert themselves to RULE and EXPLOIT the weak.In a Hollywood movie Chad would 've ended up ruined for his evil deeds while the Hollywood Chads behind the scenes collected a fat profit laughing their heads off at the naivete of the public . In LaButte 's Indie film Chad gets it all , beautiful woman , position and sadistic kicks without any personal cost whatever. & quot ; In the Company of Men & quot ; is not a 'great ' film by any means , but an especially important one nevertheless . LaButte and Eckhart 's fully realized ` white collar ' villain commemorates , for easier identification , the readily sensed but rather vague ` evil techniques ' of countless Chad-type predators throughout society . Future victims of Chads now possess a secret weapon ; and not only that , the Chadlike elements present within every person will , for anyone who has seen this film , find it harder to assert themselves without complex and ever more evasive rationalizations .	1
This film , the sequel to GODZILLA VS. BIOLLANTE , is one of the very best of Toho 's series . It begins with a very impressive musical score , and the arrival of people from the future . They say Godzilla will arise and lay waste to Japan , and ultimately the world . So , they go back to remove the Godzillasaur from Lagos Island ( which is where he 'll become Big-G ) in place of the dinosaur , three dorats are placed on the island . The creatures become King Ghidorah . To defend Japan from Ghidorah 's wrath , Godzilla is reborn ( 100 meters ! ) The monsters fight , and at the end it is MechaKing Ghidorah that delivers the final blow to Godzilla who is attacking Japan . A very good movie ! Highly reccommended for Ghidorah and Godzilla fans !	1
I loved watching giant Japanese lizards beat each other up and stomp on humanity as a child . Who could not love Godzilla movies as a kid ? So , I 'm coming at this review as someone who was raised on the Showa era of Godzilla movies.Mostly , I have n't liked Heisei era movies so far . They sort of detracted from the awesomeness of the earlier Showa era movies . While this one used a recycled monster , it 's really a new story . Ever been to Tokyo ? If you have , you 've probably seen the crazy black vans driven around by Mishima-esque ultra nationalists , spouting off insane Japanese propaganda , demanding they go back to Emperor worship and the glories of Imperial Japan . I 'm pretty sure these guys took over production of this film . In fact , one of these guys is featured as one of the main heroes of the movie ! This is a first for me . I 've never seen these guys portrayed in any movies before , but they really exist.All Godzilla movies are somewhat Japanese `` right wing . '' Godzilla is a personification of America and the atom bomb . Sometimes Godzilla is a destructive force , sometimes he helps out poor Japan : sort of like America . The Japanese military , while it always fails against Godzilla and other giant monsters , is seen as a glorious thing in Godzilla movies . Really , Godzilla movies are the only outlet I know of for modern Japanese military porn . It 's allowed , presumably because they lose . In this movie , however , they take out all stops . Liberal Americans from the future steal a time machine , and wreak havoc on Japan , to prevent their inevitable rise to the biggest and most powerful nation on earth by the 22nd century ( their overwhelming might being driven by economic growth : a plausible scenario in 1990 ) . They bring along a token race-traitor in the guise of a curly haired Japanese woman , and make fun of her a lot for having sympathy for her countrymen whose annihilation she somehow supported for a while . They go back in time to witness a heartless American attack on innocent Japanese soldiers , thwarted by a proto-Godzilla dinosaur ! The Japanese in this movie even have a secret privately owned nuclear missile submarine `` of course , we have n't kept this submarine in Japanese waters ( since Japan does n't like nuclear weapons being based in the homeland ) ; it 's somewhere not to far away from us ... in southeast Asia ... '' What glorious fantasy ! The monster fights are particularly good in this movie . King Ghidorah is one of the most spectacular enemy monsters of this franchise . Sure , the story does n't make much sense : it 's a Japanese monster movie for crying out loud ! I have n't watched most of the more recent 'Zilla movies : I 'm hoping they 're all as weird and insane as this one is . I suppose some people would complain about the crazy nationalism and racism in this movie . Personally , I do n't feel threatened by Japanese nationalism : I found those aspects of this movie to be completely hilarious and awesome . I mean , how can you be threatened by a film which has a brief scene showing a modernist building labeled , `` the Institute for Superscience ? ''	1
enjoy the movie I thought having the little women in it & Godzilla made it a little diffren then some of the other movies .	1
Mothra vs. Godzilla is one of the best Godzilla films ever . The bright colors , the excellent special effects , the monster action , and a basic , yet interesting plot all come together and make this movie what it is . This movie is just pure fun for any fan of giant monsters and/or old-school sci-fi flicks . This movie is also a lot less campy than the future films in the series . As a sci-fi film , it 's four stars , but among Godzilla films , it 's easily five.If you 're already a Godzilla fan , do n't hesitate to pick this up as soon as you can !	1
After the last three spectacular & quot ; Hesei series & quot ; entries , this one seemed a bit of a letdown . Do n't get get me wrong , it is a fun movie , but it is more Mothra than Godzilla . The real conflict is between the two bugs Mothra and the ultra cool Battra . ( It should 've been Godzilla vs. Battra ! ) Godzilla seems to have nothing particular to do except get in the way of the battling bugs . Mothra is updated with new weapons and Battra is perhaps the most impressive foe since King Ghidorah ! This is n't particularly one of Godzilla 's best outings , but if you - like me - are a Godzilla fan , you 'll love it !	1
As an avid kaiju fan , I can give a certain amount of leeway to these movies . The often campy horror mixed in with rotten English dubbing is no longer a tough pill to swallow for me . Asinine plots with meandering writing roll right off my back when presented with a nice dose of Godzilla blowing up Japan.Yet `` Godzilla Versus Mothra , '' keeps such problems to a bare minimum . This movie needs to be viewed not simply by kaiju eiga fans , but by everyone . Its messages for humanity are still yet to be heeded , and as they say , `` Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it . `` The setting of `` Godzilla Versus Mothra , '' is Japan in 1964 . Naturally , the effects of World War II were still being felt in Japan , with especially high tensions in regard to atomic weaponry . The story gets rolling when a giant egg washes ashore in Japan , prompting a news investigation . Unfortunately , before the investigation can truly get underway , a greedy entrepreneur snatches up the rights to the egg so that his boss and he can construct a theme park centered around it as its main attraction . Tensions increase between the news team and the wealthy exploitation masters when ridiculously small twin women from Monster Island demand that the egg be returned . Of course , money makes the world go round and nothing can be done to persuade the business men to relinquish the egg . Not even the timely appearance of Godzilla.Eventually , the news team goes to Monster Island , right off the coast of Japan , in order to plea for help against Godzilla . While reluctant at first , the denizens eventually agree to send Mothra to do battle with Godzilla , although such a deal only works as Mothra is eager to reclaim its egg.Mothra and Godzilla have an interesting relationship . No , it 's not a sexual one , but their life stories are quite similar . Godzilla was born from the radiation of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan at the end of World War II , and Mothra was born from nuclear testing on Monster Island . This relationship seems to convey exactly the sides of good and evil : When dealing with unfortunate circumstance , will you aid people or will you destroy ? Essentailly , thats what we 're dealing with in terms of Mothra and Godzilla . Godzilla is the ultimate destroyer , and Mothra is the ultimate defender . Imagine things on a smaller scale , both idealogically and in terms of literal size , and you 'll find a worthy comparison to our everyday life.Of course , there 's also the typical Godzilla message of the dangers of atomic experimentation . Radiation does no good to the world as `` Godzilla Versus Mothra , '' tries despearately to convey . Buried beneath this , however , is an even more hopeful message of reincarnation and the generations to come : When Mothra first does battle with Godzilla , he fails to defeat the giant lizard and is killed . Mothra 's egg hatches as a direct result of Mothra 's death , as the twins explain earlier in the movie . Essentially , when Mothra dies he is reborn as the larvae from his egg . These larvae are eventually what defeat Godzilla . If you take things from a more theoritical perspective , `` Godzilla Versus Mothra , '' is conveying a hope for the younger generation to do away with the terrible power of atomic bombs , but such a hope can only be carried on through the knowledge of the older generation . `` Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it . `` Of course , the outer layer of this yolk is laden with delicious monster on monster action . Despite being made in the mid-1960 's , `` Godzilla Versus Mothra , '' boasts some impressive fight sequences . Naturally , everything is absolutely basking in the thick cheese that is kaiju eiga , so such impressive fight sequences often involve a man in a rubber suit wildly stepping on toy tanks . Yet this cheese is to be expected . What is n't so expected are those deep , involving messages that manage to be delivered even admist poor English dubbing and a man in a giant lizard suit . My only real complaint with this movie is with the ridiculous inhabitants of Monster Island : Japanese people painted red adorned in stereotypical tribal gear , complete with cliche worship rituals . It 's a shame that a movie that excels in every other facet as to sink so low during those points of the story . Still , glimpses of a cheesy story do not hinder Godzilla Versus Mothra from being perhaps the finest kaiju eiga ever created .	1
First Godzilla movie I ever saw as a child . Finally found a DVD with both English and Japanese versions . DVD arrived in a timely manner and as advertised . DVD plays just great . Absolutely love this movie .	1
A pair of greedy guys exploit an egg that has washed ashore in the circus . Sure enough , Mothra 's tiny twins the Shobijin , come to Japan and warn them that the egg is Mothra 's and if it hatches it might destroy Tokyo . Sure enough Godzilla comes and makes a big mess of Japan . And the natives of Mothra 's island refuse to send Mothra over to help . Then who will defeat Godzilla . Tape is letterboxed . Dubbing is OK but the dialogue is garbled and kinda hard to make out . SPFX by Eiji Tsuburaya is top notch .	1
It starts A giant egg has washed up on shore after A large storm , and of course no one knows where it came from our what it is.But like always GODZILLA turns up , and starts destroying everything in sight.Its soon discovered that the egg belongs to MOTHRA , and that 's unborn will soon hatch.The special effects where alright the cast was OK , and the screener was OK as well .	1
Classic Media does it again . If you are a Godzilla fan , buy this 4th film in the series ( I hope they get the rights to King Kong vs. Godzilla ) . I 've already pre-ordered the next two films because I 've been that impressed with the bang up job Classic Media has done with this character . Bravo .	1
... that was my reaction to the English dubbed version ... It was what I recalled from Saturday afternoon TV as a kid.The original Japanese is better , of course . I like watching foreign films with subtitles , though . It just conveys the feel better .	1
I love this Godzilla movie ! It is the one where there are two tiny Japanese twins trying to save an island . If you are a fan of old Sci-Fi movies , you must have this one in your video library . I also bought a copy for my 20-something son , who is an anime fan and who loves Sci-Fi . He grew up watching the old Godzilla movies with me , and I think it enhanced his imagination . This is actually a movie the whole family will enjoy -- it has the English dubbed in , so it is easy to follow the story line .	1
I like the fact that Toho is releasing all there older Monster movies in a new dvd case.I look forward to seeing more of the movies being released so I can add them to my collection . One thing I would have liked to have seen with the movies being redone is to have the audio done in 5.1 dolby sound , than the standard audio format that they were originally done in .	1
The DVD image quality is excellent . I did n't expect much at the budget price , so the sharp , stable , colorful 2.35:1 widescreen transfer was a nice surprise . The box says & quot ; images of superb quality taken from the film 's original print. & quot ; It 's usually best to ignore puffery , but here you really do get gorgeous video -- about as good as ( say ) the Bond DVDs of the same vintage . Minor nits : there 's some dust at the ends of the reels , and the widescreen transfer is not anamorphic ( that is , not & quot ; enhanced for 16:9 TVs & quot ; ) .The 5.1 audio is choppy and strange at times . Whenever the dubbed English pops in , the sound quality changes , almost as if it briefly drops into mono . But part of the joy of vintage Godzilla is its glorious cheezyness . Making it too sterile would cut out its soul.The DVD & quot ; extras & quot ; are negligible . At the price , it 's unfair to complain about this . The important thing is that the film itself looks great . If you like Godzilla , do n't hesitate .	1
What can I say ? This is one of the classics of the Godzilla franchise . Godzilla and Mothra battle it out and its awesome .	1
When I was six years old , I sat with my friend Kevin on his jungle-gym in his backyard at night and stared up at the sky . It was a very brisk evening with little humidity , and the light pollution from the nearby highway took only a small portion of the horizon out of view . It was the best night sky I 've ever seen in suburbia in my conscious 25 years . We spent I do n't know how long staring into space , but for some reason that night every blinking ball of light on an airplane or any other airborne object was to me a UFO.We began saying things like , `` Look at that one ! That one ! '' I believed for a long time afterwards that what I saw that one night were alien ships circling Earth , that we were not alone , and that it would n't be long before everyone else knew what I knew . Of course I was a tremendous fan of Sci-fi films like `` Last Starfighter '' , `` Explorers '' , the `` Star Wars '' films , TV shows like `` Transformers '' ( later on in life a show called `` Space : Above and Beyond '' would get cancelled much to my disappointment ) . I was the believing nerd ; you could n't convince me aliens were n't real.Everytime I watch `` Close Encounters '' I get that same chill I remember from being six . That sensation the actors have on screen when they look up at the sky and suddenly realize that there 's more to watch for than just stars is real because I felt the same way that night.The plot is about a middle-age man Neary ( Richard Dreyfuss ) whose family life disintegrates after a close encounter of the second kind with an alien spacecraft as he 's called out on a job late at night . Lost on the roads , he stops to check a map when suddenly blinding lights appear from above . No his truck does n't go soaring up into a spaceship , no Neary does n't get probed , instead his truck dies , there 's a moment of anti-gravity , and Neary gets a nice sun-burn on one side of his face.UFO cliches die a happy death in this film . The aliens are neither aggressive , nor are they provoked into being aggressive . In fact , they are perfectly benevolent , if not partially enigmatic . Spielberg wanted to show a range of diversity amongst the aliens that would be parallel to humans , so you have short , stubby aliens , lanky , stick-figure aliens , and also more humanoid aliens that are expressive . Nowhere are there crop-circles , there are no long exegeses on their superior technology , no ray guns , no tractor beams or teleportations . Meeting the aliens is actually a highly organic experience ; achieved with colors , musical themes , and staring one another face-to-face.In fact , nothing is really explained , it just happens and plays itself out . How are these people having visions of Devil 's Tower in Wyoming , the exact coodinates of the alien visitation ? How do they prepare the `` arena '' that 's like a landing pad next to Devil 's Tower ? What 's up with the alien technology ? Do they have warp-drive capabilities ? Do they have anti-matter containment units ? Do they explore `` temporal disturbances '' like the crew of the Enterprise show after show ? The questions are all moot . `` Close Encounters '' is just about the encounter , the experience , not about the calculator or the engineer . If you 're looking for explorations of futuristic technology and the `` Cool ! ! ! '' factor , apply somewhere else.This is somehow the reason why I come back to the night sky again and again . I 've heard more than one backyard astronomer describe the night sky as a reliable , familiar friend . Herein lies the true form on `` Close Encounters , '' not that technology such as what the aliens possess exsists , or that we are enlightened by their coming . What gives form to the film 's premise is the possibility that when we look up at the stars , those stars are looking back .	1
I 've been converting my VHS collection to DVD & of course this one was on the keep list . DVD arrived quickly & in great shape .	1
I am not the biggest fan of Spielberg . He might be thought of as one of Hollywood 's sacred cows , but not everything he 's done has turned to gold . A regrettable example of that would be ... Batteries Not Included in 1987 . He has done his share of stinkers as well , but Close Encounters of the Third Kind , even more so than E.T. , in my opinion , is his crowning achievement . I guess I have a bias towards Close Encounters as far as Spielberg films goes because it gives me such fine reminders of my early childhood ( I was just five years old when it hit the theatres in November 1977 ) . Trust me on this , this is one creepy film . Especially the special effects and the fact a lot of it was set at night , giving one the creepy feeling that one might encounter of UFO . Enough has been already said of the film that has n't been already said . The film involves Roy Neary ( Richard Dreyfuss ) who keeps having a recurring vision of Devil 's Tower in Wyoming , which he is so compelled to go there that it ruined his marriage with Ronnie ( Teri Garr ) . Devil 's Tower was the location where Roy will encounter the giant mothership and communicate with the aliens . There are at least a couple of versions of this film . There was the theatrical version where Roy communicates with the aliens in the spaceship at the end but that 's it . And then there 's the 1980 Special Edition where you actually see the interior of the UFO that Roy went in to . I have seen both versions , so I should know . When you 're younger , you mostly enjoy the movie for the visual effects and the fact you got to see aliens at the end ( which look very similar to the & quot ; Greys & quot ; that real life people said they encountered when they were supposedly abducted by aliens ) . When you 're older , you 'll find out the movie has a lot of cover-ups and conspiracies involved as to why the area around Devil 's Tower was evacuated ( truly a treat for those who listen to Art Bell 's radio program ) . It took me so long to figure out what was up with those fighter planes found in the desert , those were the ones that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in December 1945 ( several months after WWII ended ) . If it was any movie that was perfect to watch at the drive-ins back in the 1970s , Close Encounters was truly that one movie . I am not much for Hollywood movies , because so much of it is so hyped and commercialized , or so mediocre , but this is truly amazing and needs to be seen .	1
Those who are looking for a comprehensive edition of Close Encounters need look no further than this wonderful 2 disc set.The first disc contains the newest Director 's Cut of the movie , which includes the & quot ; Mongolian ship & quot ; scene -and- Neary 's & quot ; breakdown in the shower & quot ; scene . Both of these add a dimension of reality to both the final discovery and Neary 's mental state.The second disc is the real showpiece of this set , though . It contains all of the currently deleted scenes ( including Roy 's journey inside the UFO ) and many other deleted scenes , as well as a making-of documentary , and theatrical trailers.Speilberg recently said that he could not make this movie today , and it 's easy to see why in the psychological breakdown of Neary and what this does to his family ( especialy his children ) .I first saw this movie on a Cinemascope screen , and the DVD loses almost -nothing- in the transfer to my Projection TV . As a long time Speilberg fan , I highly recommend this disc set .	1
Steven Spielberg 's second smash hit , Close Encounters of the Third Kind is an effective , optimistic , and visually appealing film . In the light of current special effects , it 's showing its age , but the story still retains wonder and interest . Richard Dreyfuss is very effective as the man who sights a group of U.F.O . 's and then becomes obsessed with them . Others that have made sightings share the obsession , including a woman whose child is abducted by the aliens . A seed is implanted in their minds that draws them to Wyoming . Their stories are intercut with the story of two scientists ( played by Truffault and Baliban ) who are investigating the strange re-appearance of ships and planes that have been missing for years , and which turn up in strange locales . They , too , receive a message ( along the more conventional method of radio contact ) to head to Wyoming.Dreyfuss logs the bulk of the screen time , and he easily carries the film . As his marriage melts down in the wake of his obsession , he manages to maintain our sympathy and interest . Truffault is a surprisingly effective actor , even when speaking through an interpreter . Even the child that gets abducted has a great performance . Likewise , the pacing and suspense through the first 2/3 of the film is flawlessly executed by Spielberg , not revealing too much and intercutting short bursts of action with more contemplative and personal scenes.Unfortunately , the film grinds down to a deadly pace in the last 1/3 of the film . It is essentially 40 minutes of a faceless mob ( of scientists ) and Dreyfuss staring at the sky and watching lights appear and disappear . Yes , the effects are good , even by today 's standards , but it is boring ! Similarly , Teri Garr as the protagonist 's wife is nothing but a carricatured harpy , and their breakup is clumsily handled by the immature ( at the time ) director . All in all , though , the film holds up well to time and repeated viewings.This DVD edition is quite nice , with a 100-minute feature with commentary and insight from most of the principle filmakers and stars ( except Truffault , who had passed away ) . Spielberg does not do commentaries for his films , but he talks a lot in the feature which should sate the film buffs . There are also some deleted scenes , including the & quot ; new & quot ; ending Columbia demanded for the & quot ; Special Edition & quot ; release in 1980 . The original 1977 ending is maintained for the film on this DVD ( and rightfully so ! ) .	1
This review is for the Blu-Ray and it was viewed on a 42 '' Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player.I am 33 years old , and must confess that I had never seen this film in its entirety . As I am a huge fan of Alien and similarly themed films , I decided to make this the day to start my journey into this disc set . I watched the original `` Theatrical '' ed , and will update my review as I watch the others . PQ 3.5 and AQ 5 . I was a little disappointed in the picture quality , which displays noticable grain . I 've seen old films with better PQ.First , the performance of the lead character was one of the most heartfelt I 've ever seen . His desire to explore and be a part of this otherworldly miracle is just stirring . I absolutely loved the score . I think that music and scoring was , perhaps used much more effectively in this time period . The effects , even for an older film , were outstanding and with a little suspension of disbelief-convincing . The space ship at the end is just incredible , as is the return of the other `` abductees '' . This is a great story , and masterpiece by Spielberg . Many elements are precursors for modern day Sci-Fi movies , series and themes in our cinematic experience . I am certainly glad to own this set , and look forward to watching the other versions another time , along with the special features .	1
This is a great deal to get the anniversary blue ray discs at this price . If you are the ultimate sy-fy addict like myself you will love it , Came with nice little booklet the size of a DVD case . What can I say but da-da-dah -- -dah -- dah	1
When a film so knocks you off your feet everytime you watch it ; when a film that is so sensually created and crafted with such magic as only the mastermind of Spielberg can create ; when a film can evoke emotions in its watcher and choke them up , without trying to hide it in front of friends , family and the like ; when a film can so catch the inner youth of angst when looking up into the nights sky and dreaming with every creative joint you can muster ; when a film 's cinematograhy can be so visually stunning and so imaginative , that you are completely in awe ; that is when you can honestly sit around on some idle Sunday in May , and share the film again with people and everyone around you says they have goosebumps , and you know there is another reason to be alive . That is the way Close Encounters makes me feel ; when I was 8 , 18 and 28 . Spielberg has created such masterpieces that have shaped our lives . I thank him . I thank him .	1
The sign of a classic movie is how well it ages and `` Close Encounters ... '' seems to get better over the years and the more times you watch it . This film has many signs to show that it was influenced by Stanley Kubrick 's masterpiece `` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' from the opening sequence to the massive role of music to the whole feel of the movie and yet Spielberg did not simply copy Kubrick 's formula but instead took the genre on to another level putting his own stamp on it . Franchises like The `` X-Files '' and many others have at least been influenced themselves by this film and the special effects are spectacular for the time given there was little if any CGI to the scale of today and yet the visual effects hold up very well even by today 's standards.This one-disc Collector 's Edition is also a real treat for fans as it has been restored very , very well for an excellent picture and sound quality . I watched this in DTS surround and anamorphic video and the impact was fabulous ! I finally did justice to my system as it gave all my speakers a great workout . I tried to find picture imperfections but in vain.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are no Special Features to speak of and for that you 'll need to get the 2-Disc version . For those who just want a great Director 's Cut version of this film and are happy with just the one disc like myself , this is a very good dvd version to get.Highly recommended !	1
This film is a true science fiction classic . When it was first released in 1977 , it competed with Star Wars as one of the top films of the year . Richard Dreyfus stars as Ray Neary , a man who suddeenly begins to have visions and hear voices . Terri Garr stars as Dreyfus ' wife . Finally , Ray 's visions begin to take strange turns , and he ends up constructing a model of Devil 's Tower in his living room . By this time , his wife and children have left him . Meanwhile , odd occurances are happening all over the world . A flight of Navy torpedo bombers missing since 1945 suddenly shows up in Mexico in almost brand new condition , and a ship is found in the middle of the Gobi Desert . The voices finally lead Ray and others to Devil 's Tower in Wyoming . There , a large spaceship lands with people that have been missing for years , including the pilots of the torpedo bombers.This movie is loaded with special effects which were excellent for their time , and it still remains one of the best sci-fi movies ever made . All sci-fi fans should watch this excellent movie .	1
Without a doubt , one of Spielberg 's best . A clean , well-written movie that blows away most alien contact flicks . Science Fiction done with respect and love for the genre . Unfortunately , there are so many versions of this film floating around that you 'd better just wait and see what they do with the DVD . I for one hated the & quot ; Special Edition & quot ; and am just as unimpressed with the Director 's Cut . There are still scenes missing that need to be restored ( including the '77 ending ) , and only DVD can do the special effects and soundtrack justice .	1
1977 saw the release of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind , and I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre . Once you see it , you 'll never forget it . For it 's time the special effects were awesome .	1
I experienced this film as a young lad and am pleased to own this very good DVD reproduction . Aside from all the obvious DVD advantages , I really enjoyed the extra features on this two-disc DVD . The interviews with Spielberg and others involved in the film are pretty facinating and insightful . Of course it is the film itself that is or is n't worth owning and for the excellent performances and the interesting concepts and questions presented here , this is a film worthy of repeat viewings and a fine addition to any DVD library .	1
Close Encounters Of The Third Kind is the most intriguing films I have ever seen . It 's filled with mystery , suspense , color and imaginationLet me discuss the DVD extra 's first . There are many . It has two versions of the film . Several `` Making Of '' documentaries and the interviews with the original cast and crew . Including the then 5-year-old Drew Barrymore . The model making , lighting , location scouting and even the actual shooting of the scenes can be found here.Listening to Spielberg discuss almost every aspect of the making of this film is fascinating . And you get two versions of the movie . The one he originally cut and the theatrical release . For Sci-Fi fans the original version Steven cut is far more superior.This is a must DVD to have . The Collectors Edition is great and is worth watching over and over again.The story is simple but the action and mystery are almost magical . The ships , lights and colors are mesmerizing to the eye . All originally shot in an aircraft hanger . Wow ! If you have forgotten the CLOSE ENCOUNTERS ARE AS FOLLOWS : Close Encounter of the 1st kind : SightingClose Encounter of the 2nd kind : EvidenceClose Encounter of the 3rd kind : Contact	1
I love this movie because of the way it moves me emotionally ... down to my very core . It sounds dramatic , but the humanity , the wonder , the magic of Close Encounters ... it can only be seen to be understood . This movie is timeless and has a special place in my heart.The acting is nearly flawless . It 's an extreme thing to say , but the world in this film feels so entirely genuine and real because of the emotion we see conveyed on screen . The direction and writing is , of course , awesome . Special effects -- still impressive , and almost more convincing than the stuff we see today . Beautiful cinematography , and the musical score is cosmic and moving.If you think the movie starts out slow ... just wait . It 's the final act that makes the build up oh-so-worth it . If you have n't seen it , you must.I 'm not very good at writing reviews ... I tend to go all over the place . So I wo n't try and tell you everything about this movie . Find out for yourself . But if you have seen it ( which you likely have ) , watch it again . Notice how it makes you feel , how it transforms the idea of fear into wonder and hope , how it makes you look at the sky at night.Close Encounters is Spielberg at his best . I hope he does another one like this in the future . This kind of movie is rare .	1
This is yet another amazing Blu Ray disc ! Perhaps better than the release prints . The sound in DTS surround ( and Dolby Digital ) is amazing as well . 1977 ? That 's hard to believe . All three versions of the film are here as well . You 've no doubt seen the film and are interested in the transfer . It 's quite simply amazing ! ! ! ! Just get this one ! It 'll push your system to its limits .	1
Great	1
I am not a sci-fi fan . At all . But i just saw `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind '' on DVD and I loved it . Maybe not Spielberg 's finest ( `` Schindler 's List '' takes the cake ) , it 's definitely one of his best.The setting is rural Indiana . Our main character is one Roy Neary ( Richard Dreyfuss ) , a struggling electrician who is contacted by aliens and travels to Devil 's Tower to meet them . Accompanying Roy is a distraught mother ( Melinda Dillon ) , whose little son was `` kidnapped '' by the aliens . But also heading to Devil 's Tower is a band of government researchers led by a French scientist named Lacombe ( Francious Traffaut ) .In all , this is an amazing movie . Filled with great acting and mind-blowing special effects , `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind '' is truly a masterpiece . And a magical John Williams score only makes it better .	1
I would recommend this product to anyone who watches Science Fiction or believe in UFOs . This is an awesome movie if you have n't seen it . There are different versions of the movie and are all on this set . The quality is great ! You would be satisfied .	1
Between autumn 1975 , after Jaws had become such a , excuse the pun , monster hit the previous summer , and November 1977 , when Close Encounters finally opened , it held the distinction of being the most eagerly awaited movie since Gone with the Wind . Alas , it did n't turn out to be the attraction for the ages that so many people , myself included , had hoped . That said , it does deliver a terrific amount of entertainment value.The title refers to a phrase invented by science author J. Allan Hynek ( who shows up in a cameo role ) to describe three potential interactions between humans and alien life forms . The first involves a sighting , the second produces physical evidence , and the third results in some sort of contact.In this story , Roy Neary ( Richard Dreyfuss ) , an Indiana electric utility company worker and family man , experiences a close encounter of the first kind one night while investigating a power outage . He sees something extraordinary that scares the wits out of him and also leaves him with an encounter of the second kind ( a partial sunburn ) and disturbs him so severely that it eventually estranges his wife Ronnie ( Teri Garr ) and his children . But the episode also endears him to Jillian Guiler ( Melinda Dillon ) , a similarly tormented , single mother whose son ( played amazingly well by four-year-old Cary Guffey ) has been kidnapped , presumably by the aliens . While Neary tries desperately to figure out what is going on , in another part of the country a secret team led by French scientist Claude Lacombe ( the great movie director Francois Truffaut ) is investigating the recent strange occurrences , and the efforts eventually draw everyone involved to a climactic meeting at a most distinctive geographic landmark . Spielberg orchestrated that climax with so much visceral power that I once saw a fellow moviegoer weeping uncontrollably after the house lights came back up.The movie 's emotional punch even caused Stanley Kaufman , the august movie critic of The New Republic , to call Close Encounters not so much a movie as `` an event in the history of faith . '' In more proper perspective , Gary Arnold concluded his review in The Washington Post by saying that if real aliens ever landed and they did n't resemble Spielberg 's vision , `` they obviously are n't movie lovers , have no romance in their souls , and to hell with ` em . '' However you end up reacting , you 'll probably agree that Close Encounters demonstrated how Spielberg was destined to become a giant of American cinema.In an interview with Film Comment magazine , Spielberg once summed up his abilities by saying , `` I sort of know what works . '' It 's true . What 's also true is Close Encounters works despite making very little sense - if start asking obvious questions the whole story begins to fall apart . No matter . Spielberg communicates subliminally to moviegoers so effectively that they willingly buy on , whatever the logical shortcomings . Along with the director 's considerable skills at cinematic storytelling , the movie boasts dazzling and groundbreaking visual effects by Douglas Trumbull ; gorgeous , Oscar-winning cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond , and possibly the best work that composer John Williams has ever done . It 's an absolute crowd-pleaser.Phil 's Favorite 500 : Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime ( 2014 edition )	1
This is a stunning movie , the extras are good as you learn how it was made , the politics Spielberg had to endure with the studio and how ( and why ) he hired certain actors for the parts.Just to clear up on this DVD set , it includes the original theatrical version , the ultimate version and the directors cut version .	1
Strange things are happening around the world ; things that challenge the imagination and open the mind to possibilities almost beyond imagining . Things that only director Steven Spielberg can explain , which he does in his monumental epic of man 's encounter with alien life , `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind . '' Planes lost in WWII suddenly appear in a Mexican desert ; a long lost ship turns up in the middle of the Gobi Desert ; and in Dharmsala , Northern India , hundreds of people are gathered together , singing -- a short `` tune '' that consists of a mere five notes , over and over , repeatedly . When they are asked where they heard this tune , the throng , as one , dramatically thrust their hands into the air and point to the sky . And , indeed , in the skies all around the world , strange things are happening.And even as these events are transpiring , one evening in Muncie , Indiana , the city is suddenly blacked out by an inexplicable power outage . Roy Neary ( Richard Dreyfuss ) is at home when it hits , and he is called in by the power company for which he works , then sent out in the darkness to an unfamiliar location . Lost , he sits in his pick-up truck at a railroad crossing , studying a map , when all at once he notices a `` disturbance '' around him . Mailboxes along the side of the road are clanging open and shut by themselves ; then things inside his truck begin to move , subtly at first , then erupting and flying about as if caught up in a tornado -- and then just as suddenly his truck is engulfed in a blinding light . He leans out the window for a look , but it 's too bright and he has to pull back . Then just as abruptly , it all stops -- the disturbance , the light -- everything . And he looks out the window again ; but this time he sees something . And though he does n't realize it at the time , at that moment , his life changed forever.In this wonderfully realized , highly imaginative film that is extremely well crafted and presented by Spielberg , he takes you along with Roy in the days that follow that strange occurrence in Muncie . Roy becomes lost in thought , drifting , unable to focus on anything , much to the consternation of his wife , Ronnie ( Teri Garr ) . But he ca n't help himself ; something -- an image -- has begun to form in his mind . He has no idea what it is or what it means , but it becomes an obsession , and slowly it begins to take shape : First in a handful of shaving cream , then in a plate of mashed potatoes , which he piles up and begins to sculpt with his fork , while Ronnie and his kids look on in bewilderment . But he can see it in his mind , and it 's like a mountain -- a mountain shaped like a `` tower . '' And Roy is n't the only one . Around the world , others are being drawn to the same image in their minds , and it 's a force that compels them , pushing them on to find whatever it is , a power so strong in can not be denied or refused . They know only one thing : Whatever it is , it 's important , and they have no choice but to follow where it may lead . And it becomes a great adventure , one in which they discover what Man has long suspected : We are not alone.Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as Neary , a regular guy -- he could be your neighbor or the man who comes to install your phone -- and gives a thoroughly convincing , introspective performance while creating a character with whom it is easy to relate and through whom you are able to share this unique adventure . Garr does a good job , as well , as Ronnie , the wife concerned with her husband 's sudden and seemingly bizarre behavior , someone with whom you can certainly sympathize . Dillon delivers , too , as the single mother who suddenly finds herself caught up in these inexplicable and extraordinary events , and also turning in a memorable performance is the young Cary Guffey , as Barry , Jillian 's son , who makes his own connection with the other-worldly visitors.The supporting cast includes Francois Truffaut ( Lacombe ) , Bob Balaban ( Laughlin ) and Lance Henriksen ( Robert ) . An uplifting , positive motion picture , `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind '' is thoroughly entertaining , as well as thought provoking . Spielberg draws you in as few filmmakers can , with a great story and with characters who are readily accessible and with whom it is easy to identify -- all of which adds up to an absorbing , memorable and enjoyable experience , and a perfect example of the real magic of the movies .	1
Admittedly , an engaging , enchanting film . 25 years later the performance of French film director Francois Truffaut as a foreign scientist , Richard Dreyfuss 's obsession with mashed potatoes , and the sonic exploration of the octave and its overtones remain nestled in the viewer 's subconscious , if not conscious , memory . But in retrospect this film followed an era in which an idealistic generation , once devoted to social change and the immortalization of its own youth culture , had to settle for the latter of the two possibilities . The & quot ; story & quot ; represents not just an escape from the banality of middle-class values but from responsibilities , conflicts , risky human relationships , and life itself . Another capitalistic commodity pretending to renounce a way of life it in fact promotes and is inextricably bound to , & quot ; Close Encounters & quot ; is the first of many blockbuster & quot ; Third Kind & quot ; epics to achieve success on the big screen . Play it with a good sound system .	1
This is such a great , great , great film . It succeeds on so many levels and this new directors cut is the best presentation of this film yet . Many scenes are restored to the film that I think add nicely to the build up and some have been removed that add to the mystery at the end , such as not showing us the inside of the ship from Richard Dreyfuss 's perspective . Also the use of Devils Tower , a black monolith combined with the eerie choral overture is a Spielberg homage to Kubrick 's 2001 . It is interesting to note that the government organization that is researching the aliens use the illuminati pyramid as their symbol indicating to the audience the secret society connections , they even have their own flag . Also I believe that Spielberg is clearly pointing out to us by the way the aliens arrive in clouds and thunder with flashing lights that they may very well be the God of the bible . Them choosing a mountain to appear for communication , descending upon it in cloud and thunder is right out of the old testament . Also the smaller ships have a definite face or animal like appearance and remind one of the visions of the bible prophets and from a distance can appear like stars in the sky when they mimic the big dipper which could also explain the ancient worlds fascination with the stars . But to remove all doubt Spielberg holds a church blessing on the team that will be going back with the aliens , as the minister gives the blessing he reads from a passage of the bible talking about angels lifting us up and in the background is a Christian cross side by side with the star of David . A deeper film than many believe and overall a beautiful DVD transfer with incredible sound .	1
This review is based upon the single disc , Blu Ray of Close Encounters of the Third Kind . Others have so fully summarized the movie and provided their opinions upon the acting performances , et al , I will refrain from doing so and just focus upon the quality of the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray which is what I do with all my reviews.With this disc you get 3 different versions of the film , you get the theatrical release , a special version and the Directors cut . I chose the Director 's Cut as if it is what Spielberg envisioned and not the studios , then that I what I want to see . The theatrical version clocks in at 135 minutes , while the Special Edition clocks in at 132 minutes and the Director 's Cut at 137minutes . The Audio for all 3 versions is DTS MA 5.1 lossless audio for English and French , while the Spanish viewer gets lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 . Since both lossless codecs are very good and significantly better than any lossy audio codec , I do not believe that anyone could tell the difference , but more on the audio later on.VIIDEO ... .The cover of the Blu Ray says that the film has been remastered and I believe it . While I had not seen the film in many years and do not own the Standard Def DVD and , thus , have nothing to compare it with , all I can say is that the video transfer looks beautiful in all ways . The colors are just gorgeous with the daylight sky shots a rich and smooth blue . The blacks are as true to black as I have seen in the past with great details easily showing in these dark and shadowy areas . At no point in watching the Director 's Cut did I see any artifacting nor stair-stepping which would have been prominent is many of the wide angle landscape shots . The video transfer absolutely deserves the 5 stars I gave it.AUDIO ... Watched in the lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 and the balance of audio levels between the dialogue and John Williams music score was exceptionally good . The music score is spread quite nicely across the front stage with stereo imaging of the instruments nicely placed . During the first half of the movie I was a touch disappointed that the rear channels were not used that often for front to rear pans or foley FX . However , the second half of the film wakes things up with several uses for the rear channels and discreet channeling of the audio fx to both left and right . It is here where your LFE sub channel will come alive and if you have a good sub and it is set properly , it will certainly get a musical workout . I rate the overall audio with 4 stars.EXTRAS ... While I have read that there were several extras on other releases of this film , this particular release had no 'making of ' documentaries or commentaries . The only extra , which I did not use or try , is a special pop up called 'In Movie A View from Above ( Editor 's Fact Ttrack ' . This feature pops up an icon , depending upon which version of the film you are watching that provides a fact or two about why a specific scene was cut or added back in as well as other trivia I suppose . At least there were no previews for other movies taking up room on the Blu Ray . I hate to pay for advertising and an even greater compression of the feature film than it needs to be.All in all , this is a classic film with brilliant work by Richard Dreyfus , a superior actor , and a great transfer on Blu Ray . I would encourage you to purchase it.I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase or not.Thank you for reading .	1
Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977 ) Science Fiction , Drama , 137 minutesDirected by Steven SpielbergStarring Richard Dreyfuss , Melinda Dillon and Teri GarrClose Encounters works so well because of the way Spielberg slowly increases the suspense . This is not a movie that relies on special effects ; it succeeds because of a strong script and good acting . Although we learn of the alien presence at the start of the movie , most of the story consists of people 's reactions to those early events.Why is Roy ( Dreyfuss ) behaving oddly and causing his wife and children to freak out ? Chicken wire and mud in the living room is not normally a recipe for a good marriage , but it soon becomes clear why Roy thinks it 's necessary . The idea is pretty simple , with an image being placed in the minds of selected people . Jillian ( Dillon ) has reasons of her own to pursue something and teams up quite believably with Roy . I like that there 's no forced romance between the two and that they are merely acting on instinct.One refreshing thing about the movie is that the aliens are n't portrayed as invaders . There 's no hostility in their actions , they just want to know and understand us . What a contrast to most science fiction movies up until that point.Spielberg keeps you interested for over two hours as two people journey across the country . That 's quite an achievement . Notice too that the conclusion resists the temptation to show us too much about the aliens . Close Encounters is great cinema and has wide appeal to audiences of all ages .	1
Great special effects are of course of value in science fiction but here the draw is really the characters . I felt invested in each of the main characters and wanted to keep watching . The music was haunting and well planned , adding wonderfully to the atmosphere of the story . Might be too frightening for young children but not boring to non-science fiction fans since the focus is on what drives and pushes the characters .	1

Are we alone ? Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a classic American film . It was directed by Stephan Spielberg and stars Richard Dreyfus . This film set the tone for much of what happened at the movies for roughly the next 15-20 years following its 1977 theatrical release . Close Encounters is essentially a near perfect product defining the time it came out . The film explores alien visitors , government conspiracies , general paranoia , sensationalism . family issues , and ultimately madness . The depth these issues are explored make this film a hallmark of American cinema . It is the movie version of imagination and wonder . This is a philosophy and vision regarding what an alien visit to the planet would look like . There is no war and nothing is getting blown up . The main thing happening is communication . It is amazing . It is done in a such a thoughtful way that it stands effectively as an excellent contribution to the collective consciousness imagination about such matters as alien visits . After repeat viewings the most important question is : What do you believe ? This is a human film that defines the medium of movie making.Ladies and gentlemen , this is a flying saucer .	1
Director : Steven SpielbergCast : Richard Dreyfuss , Francois Truffaut , Teri Garr , Melinda Dillon.Running Time : 137 minutes.Rated PG for mild language and some intense situations.Fresh off the outrageous success of his first hit & quot ; Jaws & quot ; , Steven Spielberg creates the extra-terrestrial epic & quot ; Close Encounters of the Third Kind & quot ; . While obviously a film about aliens , Spielberg uses star Richard Dreyfuss as a chess piece to how the mystique and mystery of a foreign being can not only cause a man to go crazy , but can ultimately influence mankind as a whole.Dreyfuss is extremely under-rated in his performance as a man driven to the brink as he experiences an otherworldy encounter with extra-terrestrials while inside of his vehicle . Not knowing the affect this would later have on his life , he returns home as if nothing happened . Dreyfuss 's behavior grows stranger and stranger ( he first makes a mountain out of mashed potatoes at the dinner table , then creates an even larger model of this mysterious mountain out of his yard while still inside his house ) , he realizes that he most confront this incredible feeling that has overcome his mind and search for answers . What he encounters is magical and unbelievable.Spielberg 's direction is top-notch and sincere , proving that his previous sucess was not a fluke . Much like his other alien film , & quot ; E.T & quot ; , & quot ; Close Encounters ... & quot ; provides a symbolic theme that is far more significant than what the aliens look like or what planet they came from . With the peformance of Dreyfuss , Spielberg is able to to show that it is okay for all of us to return to the kid we once were , and to explore all of the questions that we all want answers for . A true spectacle of a film with superb special effects , a wonderful musical score by John Williams , and a child-like charm that is for the whole family .	1
I was only 11 years old when this first came out in 1977 . Because I was so caught up in the Star Wars phenomenon , and also because I thought ( being a child , mind you ) that the movie story line was a bit lame ( and a bit weird with the way Richard Dreyfuss 's character was ) , I did n't particularly care for it . Where 's Luke Skywalker ? Darth Vader ? `` May the force will be with you ? '' The Death Star ? The Millenium Falcon ? You get the idea . Nevertheless , I still remember those 5 notes/tones that define it . After a time , I pretty much forgot all about the movie . Until I saw it on T.V . recently . Wow , 35 years have passed since its release ! I now appreciate the story line much more , especially the human element of it , understanding human nature much more as a 46 year old adult now . I 'm not so ga-ga about the movie as the average person , but I still do like it and think it is a good movie . Seeing such a young Richard Dreyfuss makes this movie have such a nostalgic impact , and the appreciation of the passage of time . Not to mention , Teri Garr and Melinda Dillon are such attractive ladies . Especially Melinda Dillon , what a cutie-pie ! ! While watching the movie , I have such a crush on her !	1
WENT FROM RENTAL TO OWNERSHIP OF THIS MOVIE	1
Two of the most beautiful things in the world are the written word and the human figure . Even the ones that are not special in themselves embody meaning and subtlety . When Greenaway uses the figure to carry words , he creates imagery that can not be forgotten.There is so much in this movie that I hardly know where to begin . It starts with a child . Her father 's birthday ritual is to tell her a story , always the same one , and to paint calligraphy on her face . Maybe it 's a little silly , but it 's sweet and loving.Over time , the girl loses her innocence but gains the strength of adulthood . Her memory of that charming ritual develops , too . First , it loses its childhood innocence ; it becomes a passion for her , and the standard by which she measures her lovers . In the end , the ritual gains even more strength and becomes the vehicle for a deadly obsession.I must warn the potential viewer that the movie 's second half goes places far beyond where sanity stops . It is not for people with tender sensibilities.I 'll come back to this movie for it sensual beauty . I wo n't come back too often , though . The raw rage at the end is just too hard .	1
I always liked this film , Just Johnny . If you are a KR fan it 's primo Keanu . Bizarre casting of the Japanese heavy who is just too light , even with the cool laser garrot , but the rest of the cast makes up for it . It a film I pull out about every 3 years and watch .	1
Great movie . Avoided it for a long time due to the review here . Mistake to believe anything Jeff Shannon ever wrote . Excellent acting , Dolph does a great turn with his role , must have been one of Dina 's first movies , and Keanu is into his Neo personna . Watch this movie !	1
Okay , this one is a sci-fi Keanu Reeves film . It 's the future and it 's become very hard to keep corporate secrets , almost impossible and even deadly . So they 've developed a way to jack into the brain , upload/download information without it being obvious to the thieves . However exceeding your capacity is dangerous and deadly as well . Johnny does that and his contact is missing plus the badies are out to get him . He must get it out of his head before he has a melt-down . It is a bit obvious at times but a few surprises lie in store . If you like stuff like Gatacca , Ultra-Violet , hackers and so on you probably will enjoy this one . This is both subtitled and closed captioned for the deaf in English .	1
Great movie about a world in which technology becomes the enemy in the form of the shakes . The people with the cure do n't want you to have it and there is a genetically enhanced Dolf Lundgren trying to cut your head-off . Your head has built in memeory storage but you overloaded it with a very large save now you need help from some quack doctor to save not only yourself but also humanity .	1
What makes so many bad movies so endearingly laughable ? More to the point , what got the film Johnny Mnemonic nicknamed Johnny Moronic ? The sight of high-paid Hollywood actors gamely trying and failing to utter dialogue that could have defeated Laurence Olivier , that 's what . William Gibson may be a god to cyberpunks , but the screenplay he wrote of his own short story Johnny Mnemonic foists a terminal case of terrible chatter onto a cast that already had his plot to deal with.Keanu Reeves is a `` mnemonic courier '' who has rented out so much of the memory space in his brain that he 's now desperate to download data before `` synaptic seepage '' kills him ( so much for your theories on what makes Keanu Reeves strange ) . How is it he has room up there to rent ? `` I had to dump a chunk of longterm memory -- my childhood , '' he tells his vampy bodyguard Dina Meyer . When Meyer points out that if the villains who want what 's in Reeves 's head get hold of him , there 's `` going to be one dead Johnny , '' Reeves replies , `` I 'm gon na be dead anyway if I do n't get this sh -- outta my head ! '' Which is exactly what the audience is thinking.Reeves and Meyer call on `` flesh mechanic '' Henry Rollins , who ca n't do much for Reeves , but diagnoses Meyer as having the fatal virus that 's killing half the planet . Pointing to plugged-in widgets all around him , Rollins claims that the virus is the product of `` information overload , all the electronics around you poisoning the airwaves ! What causes it ? The world causes it ! Technological f -- -ng civilization ! But we still have all this sh -- 'cause we ca n't live without it ! '' ( Like , it 's the DVD player , not this movie , that 's going to kill us . ) '' Street preacher '' Dolph Lundgren , decked out in robe , sandals and long blond locks to look like a born-again Michael Bolton , is good for a solid laugh when he tries to kill Reeves and Rollins , shouting `` Come to Jesus ! `` , but Johnny Mnemonic hits its high point when Reeves climbs atop a pile of garbage ( no comment ) and yells : `` What the -- -- is going on ? What the -- -- is going on ? Listen , you listen to me ! You see that city over there ? That 's where I 'm supposed to be ! Not down here with the dogs and the garbage and the f -- -- - ' last month 's newspapers blowing back and forth ! I 've had it with them , I 've had it with you , I 've had it with all of this ! I want room service ! I want the club sandwich ! I want the cold Mexican beer ! I want a ten-thousand-dollar-a-night hooker ! I want my shirts laundered like they do at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo ! `` After that spectacular monologue , you 're ready for anything , which is fortunate , because the answer to Reeves 's and Meyer 's problems turns out to come from a cheesy animatronic dolphin who resides in a large fish tank `` set up to sample software from enemy subs -- infrasound scan , right through the hull . '' Reeves is told , `` He will teach you can-opener code . '' We 'll leave you wondering what he does for Meyer 's virus . Rest assured this fake mammal is not the answer to the film 's problems . Then again , what can you do for a film in which even the extras have bad lines ?	1
There really was n't anything glamorous about the u-boat war in the atlantic ocean . Although the german u-boats racked up very impressive numbers , and did the best they could to cut Britian 's life line . The constant spector of a terrible death was always a factor . The u-boats were cramped , the living conditions were poor , and the longer the voyage lasted , the worse the conditions became for the crews . I find quite amazing , that their morale and determination to carry out their missions , lasted so long . It is a testimony to their courage and sense of duty , that they kept on going out in those metal coffins . Eventually their cause came to ruin , but one can not deny their courage . Avery impressive film , well worth the price . JRV	1
Originally screened in six 45 minute episodes , this film charts the story of a typical German U-Boat crew during WWII . But even trimmed to video length , this is one of the best WWII films ever made - The cast , script , soundtrack , and sets are all outstanding , but the triumph of this picture is that regardless of nationality or allegiances , the narrative direction is impartial in it 's delivery - depicting the horror and futility of war . Through victory , loss , pain and laughter you become drawn in to the characters of each one of the U-Boats crew , and the movie is uplifting as well as emotionally engaging . Without the graphic splendour of many later underwater films , this movie is an intense human drama that few who have watched , have failed to remember . Although also available in English language format , it is best when viewed in its original German language so DVD is the best choice here , giving lots of options , and extra information .	1
If you are interested in WWII , and especially the Atlantic Ocean area of operations , this is an excellent movie by any standards . Granted , it is about a German U-Boat , and crew , and is in German with subtitles , but it is by far the most intense , well acted and well written film about actual life on a submarine ever made . You get a real sense of what daily life must have been like and what it feels like to endure depth charging , with almost no hope of surviving . The sense of claustrophobia is extremely intense.There are very few movies out there that come close to what this does to show the horrors of war and the human toll of serving one 's country , while disagreeing with its policies and leaders . An unforgettable and remarkable movie .	1
If you do n't have a bluray of Das BOOT , this is the one to get . It has both the Theatrical release ( original us ) and the director 's cut with added material . But it is not the super extended version ( which ) quite frankly is difficult to watch imho . I think the Director 's cut nicely balances the message of tedium/horror far more so than the TV version . Perhaps watching the TV version as a multi part show over several weeks would make it more palatable , but trying to watch it in one go is just about impossible.I am very pleased with the added features of the BluRay , extensive interviews with wolfgang Petersen , and cameo by Jurgen Prochnow .	1
There is only one word to describe the excellence of this film , and I do n't think I know what it is . Das Boot is surely the greatest submarine movie ever made in the history of film making . Incredibly realistic , good acting , high tense adventure , a non-stop thrill ride of the senses . Jurgen Prochnow places himself as one of the greatest actors in the world with his performance as the Captain of U-96 . Based completly on a true story , I firmly beleive that this movie is not only the best submarine film , but quite possibly the greatest World War Two film ever made . It includes all aspects that make a good war movie what it is . Action , Passion , Compassion , Thrill , Horror , and Uncertainty . I strongly recomend this film to ANYONE .	1
Das Boot fundamentally changed the way I viewed war and the horrors it inflicts on all of its participants . It is a scathing indictment of militarism and the prevailing mindset that has created the myths of heroes and villains in combat . There is no doubt in my mind that this was the entire point of the film , not just to portray the realities of U-Boat adventure . The fact that the production was the largest ever staged in Germany , and how brutally it portrays the inhumanity of both the men and machines of WWII , speaks volumes to that country and its acknowledgement of the atrocities perpetrated in that war against its enemies and its own countrymen . Nothing like Das Boot has ever come out of Japan , or for that matter , any of the victors . I suppose the closest would be 'The Thin Red Line '' , which I found totally overbearing and simplistic.The characters are also exceptionally well written , with Jurgen Prochnow the standout as the morally conflicted but ultimately dutiful Nazi captain . There is a very memorable scene where he is asked to explain his heroic exploits to the high command at a thrown-together feast . And the last hour and climax of Das Boot honestly made me a changed person . Even looking at a naval ship makes me feel disgusted . It is so extraordinarily sad that human beings have been reduced to killing one another in these horrendous machines ... what a pathetic waste .	1
This is one of the few well known films that merits an extended cut . Oftentimes , a classic is reissued in `` Director 's Cut '' form and it becomes evident why scenes were eliminated in the first place ( Apocalypse Now Redux comes to mind ) . The added material in Das Boot amplifies the claustrophobia and ennui , esssential to a submarine drama . Since this is primarily a character driven piece , the additional time spent with them is a bonus.The originally shot German/UK tv mini-series 5 hr . version called Original Uncut is also available . Have n't seen that one but this 208 min . version is stellar . I see that both extended versions are available for roughly the same price on Amazon ... .one reviewer recommends this version if watching for the first time and that is probably sound advice .	1
its a good movie..really feel at times that you are in that sub deep down in the ocean ... good war movie ... i did see it before and just wanted to see it agin ... i do enjoy the movies from the 40's..especially world war ll movies ... this one the men speak german with english on the screen ... but it is still a very good movie ... good entertainment..	1
Classic - gets top rating . Long and very detailed , be prepared in advance , have plenty of popcorn , this is a real thriller and far surpasses anything Hollywood ever tried to make.Best submarine movie ever made ! ! !	1
A great movie . One of the best World War II movies ever made . I love it ! ! !	1
This is the movie that U-571 wanted to be but could n't even come close to equalling . One of the best ever with a DVD to truly frame its greatness . You 've got ta get it . Nothing like stereo sound to emphasize the sound of an exploding depth charge . Especially contrasted with a moment of such intense silence that you can hear Jurgen Prochnow sweatting ! The DVD is the director 's cut which adds a full hour of footage that it is impossible concieving where it must have been cut . The move is far more intense at its full length and with the extra footage you get to learn more about the youthful vigor of the crewmembers as well as the Captain 's disdain for the Nazi heirarchy . My only complaint is that you have to flip the DVD over halfway through the feature but the option of listening to the movie in English , or German , with English , French , or German subtitles as well as all the other extras more than makes up for it . I prefer the original German with the subtitles off so I ca n't understand a thing . SCHNELL , SCHNELL !	1
If you speak English and like DVD format , this is THE definitive version of Das Boot to see.The clarity of the format visually is excellent , the German is unbelievably clear . Here you 'll see all of the parts that really should have been included in versions more accessible to Americans , that should NEVER have been cut out to make it `` feature length . `` The impact is even greater , the humanity the bonded the 50-odd sailors into the iron coffins of the U-Boot Waffe is palpable . While the differences are subtle , they are most dramatic ... including the rendezvous of the Matrose with his pregnant French girlfriend , or the few minutes of detail left out when the Kaleun ( Kapit & auml ; nleutnant ) , LI ( Leutnantingeneur ) , and Leutnant Werner ( Marinekriegsberichter -- reporter ) take a stroll in La Spezia and the Captain informs these two they will not be going ashore ... those few minutes show why J & uuml ; rgen Prochnow IS a great actor.All in all -- the version to buy and to view more than once . Unless , of course , you speak German and can watch the German unedited version . Prost !	1
Having seen Das Boot over 20 years ago , it was great to review it again and recall many of the scenes , especially their gut wrenching experience in the Mediterranean Sea and the final end when the submarine is sunk at the repair facility .	1
This is an excellent , crystal clear movie in HD . I did n't like that you had to constantly read the closed captioning . I 've seen this on TV in English .	1
When a film about World War II has American audiences routing for the Germans , hoping and cheering them on for the success of their mission , one can only become conscious of the ultimate horror and futility of war . One also has watched a helluva movie.Back in the early 80 's I called in sick ( along with some friends ) to see the opening of Petersen 's Das Boot . We were all stunned . Went out for a beer and then returned to the theatre and watched it all over again.Petersen masterfully developed his cast into a crew who are no longer `` the enemy '' but fresh faced kids , neither prepared nor aware of the horror that was waiting them . When I first saw `` Das Boot '' - I was the same age as those kids so it resonated more powerfully than I could have possibly imagined . In this wonderful uncut release of the original German miniseries we 're forced to spend even more time with the crew of U-96 and in that time get to knew them better . We see friendships and bonds formed , the irritability that comes with lack of privacy and tension so dense it becomes an almost physical presence . We also get more of the sense of what war really is - immense spans of boredom and ennui interrupted by the occasional horrors of violence and death.Petersen kept his cast indoors and unshaven during the entire shoot with the resulting effect that the crew actually looks like a group of men who have not seen natural light , or breathed fresh air for 65 days . Additionally , the actors were all put through vigorous physical training so that when racing through the set of a dangerously reconstructed U-Boat , they move naturally with an almost balletic swiftness that is dazzling.This is masterful filmmaking of the highest order , with sound and lighting that capture the claustrophobic nature of a submarine , almost suffocating the viewer . The scenes of Das Boot racing through the Atlantic , it 's difficult near fatal destruction in the narrow Strait of Gibraltar will have your blood pumping at fever pitch.The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent , each actor - even ones with little to no dialogue , making bold indelible choices in developing their characters.J & uuml ; rgen Prochnow as the Captain gives a remarkable , strong performance , making one believe - from the very beginning - this is a true leader of men . You have no difficulty beliving this crew standing behind this captain 's every decision.Petersen 's writing of Herbert Gr & ouml ; nemeyer as the eager young reporter , Werner is a masterful creation . Werner becomes the multi-faceted prism through whom we watch and live this story . Part Greek chorus , part conscience of the uninvolved , we join him as an outsider on the inside , becoming participants in this heart rending drama . Gr & ouml ; nemeyer 's performance becomes the very soul of Das Boot . `` Das Boot '' remains one of my all time favorite films and to finally be able to own and see it as Wolfgang Petersen intended is one of the best things to happen since the invention of DVD .	1
I had difficulty getting into the book , but the movie kept me glued to the screen . The movie was long , but it really gives you insight into life and roles on a WW II sub and the terror they faced . Great characters & acting . Loved the ending !	1
The movie was fascinating to view -- the subject was of interest and had great suspense . It was a type of treatment of the subject seldom seen in most movies . It addressed curiosoty as to what goes on in such a situation to which the movie alludes .	1
Well Done ! This film is about the moment of change in the Battle of the Atlantic , from easy kills for U-Boats to heavily guarded convoys . This is a journey into the madness of war.The movie opens with the crew of U-97 on shore liberty in occupied France . While the drinking is at a height , we get to know the crew members and notice that the captain is only thirty years old . The others look like children.A war correspondent joins the patrol and is told not to photograph the crew until time has allowed them to grow beards . `` We do n't want Churchill to know that he is being beaten by children , '' says the captain . But the moment of truth is at hand.This work is well done . After the time of shore liberty , the filming is entirely in or on the submarine . The sounds and odors become real ; the close living quarters are everywhere.Well worth the price .	1
Great in showing the other side of war . Being away from loved ones , sincere care for those under your command . Also the trials and tribulations of being a submariner .	1
This great film , which I originally watched in German , is fantastic . This has to be the best W.W. II Sub film ever made . We follow a German crew on a single mission ... Very intense and action filled . The Director 's Cut DVD offers vast improvements via re-mastered sound and a crystal clear picture . There are 60 or so minutes of extra footage bringing the length of the movie to well over 3 hours .	1
This outstanding film has three current existing versions:1 . The United States Theatrical Version ( 2 hrs . 25 mins ) 2 . The European Theatrical Version ( Also known as the re-released Director 's Cut ) ( 3 hrs . 31 mins ) 3 . The Original Uncut German Television Version ( 4 hrs . 53 mins ) I have seen and own all 3 versions of Das Boot , I have the United States version on two tapes , one in German with English subtitles and the other dubbed in English . I also have the Director 's Cut and the Orginial Uncut Version on DVD.The United States Theatrical Version is the worst version to watch , yet still very good and still worth watching . The Director 's Cut is more worth watching than the USA Theatrical Version , but not as worth it than the Uncut Version . The Uncut Version is definitely the best version to watch , but it 's oppressive length will piss off some viewers . This version is more than twice as long as the USA Version ( ! ) So that means , more than half of the existing footage of Das Boot was removed for the USA Version ! So , Das Boot gets 3 1/2 stars for the theatrical version , 4 for the Director 's Cut and 4 1/2 for the Uncut Version .	1
This is a great submarine movie . Best I have seen.Though bitter , depressing and often quite scinical , this movie gives the audience the feel of Germany 's U-boat arm during the battle of the Atlantic from the whoring and drinking of crews on leave in France knowing they are about to die in battle next mission to the deployment in battle against allied convoys , this movie gives the audience the feel of being there.Extremely well done .	1
Unique with it 's outlook from the German side . Puts 'faces ' on them and shows the stark reality of their job .	1
Those are what make `` Das Boot '' so memorable , especially in this directors ' cut , which goes further in the physcological and physical strain that was put on the crew of U-96 . Set in 1941 as WWII was heating up , a veteran U-boat captain takes a new , unexperienced crew out into the treacherous Atlantic to hunt down British warships . For the first 21 days , they encounter nothing , but writer/director Wolfgang Peterson ( whose American films include `` Air Force One , '' `` In the Line of Fire , '' and the Trojan war epic `` Troy '' due out the summer of 2004 ) uses this time to build strong characters , most of whom are pure seamen at heart , and care little for the ambitions of the Hitler and the Third Reich , fighting only for their country . That fact is a major part of why `` Das Boot '' is so extraordinary ( other than the white-knuckled tension that kicks-in when they meet British Warships , another accomplishment to director Peterson ) . It shows WWII history from the point of the Germans , who were not all die-hard believers in Hitler and his creed.But once Her Majestys ' Navy shows up , `` Das Boot '' becomes the precedent for unbearable suspense . Shooting all the scenes aboard the U-Boat in a cramped , true-to-life replica of the submarines , Director Peterson with hand-held camera crafts the mounting tension with expert timing that produces large jolts of adrenaline . Towards the end , you find yourself rooting for the U-Boat crew against the Royal Navy amid the crew 's tangible fatigue and seemingly impossible obstacles , including a near-suicidal mission when then try to force their way through the Gibraltor Strait , which is an Allied stronghold . But because of the craftsmanship and talent of Petersen , his actors and technical team , you can not help help but sympathize and root for the crew . `` Das Boot '' more than earns its continuing reputation as one of the greatest war movies ever made .	1
This is the type of movie that you watch when you are really longing for a submarine movie . This is a well-made and very realistic epic of a real life German U-boat in WW II Be prepared to spend the whole day watching because it is very long but very worthwhile . It is a must see ! Noel Serrano	1
The Bottom Line : Das Boot is a very entertaining and engaging submarine movie that does n't feel long even at 200+ minutes ; marred only by occasionally-bad special effects , ( all the scenes in the conning tower look thoroughly studio-bound ) it introduces characters worth caring about and then runs them through a thrilling gauntlet .	1
This is simply the best submarine film . And for fans of Das Boot , this uncut version does some good . Lets you really think about how it was during those times and how it was inside these submarines . A good film should do that . A good film should let you get lost in the story and the period of that time.This uncut version of nearly 5 hours is a treat , and it goes by so fast that the only thing you notice while immersed into the storyline is that you have to get up to change the DVD 's in the player.After it is all done you start to wonder when are the movie people going to remake their movies in-dept and longer for the DVD 's ? But then you realize that it works for THIS film because it 's so good , and it may or may not work for other films .	1
Das Boot is a very authentic depiction in the life of a German U-Boat crew . Imagine 60,000 of these brave men sent to prowl the Atlantic and only 3,000 came back to tell the tale . This is truly a classic . Superb acting by Juergen Prochnow as the U-Boat captain . I still couldnt get used to the ending though . By the time you finish the movie , you 'll feel very much attached to the crew . It 'll leave you breathless , and maybe even shed a tear . Note how the film was shot inside the boat . The movie pioneered the use of hand-held cameras to film the scenes to get an up close and personal feel for the audience- see Saving Private Ryan in the first 15 minutes of the movie and you 'll now what I mean . This movie deserves a nice place in your collection .	1
An excellent movie that portrays life on the other side of the war ! They had a very tough job and still they did their duty as seen from their side . Our own forces had it just as bad too , and they all still did what was required of them ! Amazing !	1
This is a great film and the remastering is the best I have seen so far . This movie was based upon actual events and that makes the film even more breathtaking . The Dolby Digital ( 5.1 ) English format is dubbed but this is not distracting when watching it . If you love great war movies , you 're missing out if you do n't give this one a chance !	1
I remember & quot ; Das Boot & quot ; when it first aired on German TV as a series and recorded it on Beta ( hey , my Mom was told that Beta was the wave of the future ! ) I watched this movie over and over , even got the Buchheim book for Christmas , and in the preceding years wrote a graduate history paper based on the German U-Boot experience . All this from Petersen 's masterpiece ! The & quot ; long version & quot ; of the movie - the Director 's Cut - is my favorite because it closely follows the series . I 've seen the shorter movie version and felt that editing ruined some important nuances . I also liked the dubbing on the Director 's Cut , because some of the English translations were done by the German actors themselves ( at least it sounded as if Prochnow , Gruenemeyer and Semmelrogge were doing the English translations . ) My favorite part is when the crew sings , & quot ; It 's a long way to Tipperary ! & quot ; All in all - I HIGHLY recommend this movie , in whatever version you decide to watch . The portrayal of the German U-Boot experience is factual and the acting is above superb .	1
This fine movie is without a doubt , the best war film and certainly one of the top twenty films of all time . This movie made Wolfgang Peterson ( The Perfect Storm ) a sought after director and is an extremely well done war film from the German 's point of view . I know some people who refuse to enjoy this spectacular film because it does indeed tell the entire film through the point of view of the Germans . I say to them , get a grip ! These are people too and they were serving their country , like any American would do . The director 's cut , at some 3 and 1/2 hours is long , but never boring ! Get the Director 's Cut and experience Das Boot like the great war film it was made to be .	1
I had never seen the original , so I rented this movie from Netflix and halfway through the first viewing I decided I had to have my own copy of it . You quickly forget that these submariners are German and become involved in the drama of life aboard a U-boat and the personal relationships between the characters . The Captain , excellently portrayed by Jurgen Prochnow , realizes early on in their mission that his superiors , supposedly in charge , have little idea of what they 're doing ; resulting in confused orders , orders that never arrive or arrive too late , and tragic consequences for the soldiers and submariners caught in the middle . The dedication of the crew in keeping their `` Boot '' in working condition , and the mind-numbing boredom during the intervals between battles , are vividly brought to life . I wo n't spoil the ending , only to say that after all the effort expended by these young men ( the average age is 18 and the Captain himself was only 30 ) to get their crippled ship home , the result is a heartbreaking tragedy . The English dubbing is very well-done , although I recommend watching the movie in German with English subtitles -- there are a lot of subtleties and nuances that are lost in the translation . Five Stars and more !	1
This is an excellent movie and we very much like to watch it . We like the German version and would recommend it !	1
Das Boot ( Director 's Cut ) [ Blu-ray ] I had to buy this DVD . I remember the first time I saw this movie it was after chow on board my submarine while at sea and the place was packed not a extra space any where almost everyone off duty had turned out to watch the movie ( it was the first showing ) . As the movie progressed we got more evolved in it , feeling more for the U Boat crew as they lived threw the events of their patrol . As it evolved . It was so quit you could hear the air circulation fans running and their very quit . We almost became one with the crew of that U Boat feeling what they were feeling . It was a very well made movie and represented the life on the old diesel boats . Both theirs and ours . I would highly recommend this movie and in Blu-ray it really brings it to life .	1
This was a excellent movie on the life of German submariners during WW2 . Makes the submarines of today look like under water cruise ships by comparision.BUT DONT STOP HERE ! After you watch this great film , read `` Iron Coffins '' by Herbert Werner . Which is a real life account of his career in the U-boat flotilla . What Werner experieces even tops what happened to the characters in this movie , and this guy is STILL alive in his 90 's living in Florida ! Amazing !	1
As a young German officer , Lothar-Gnther Buchheim was assigned to join a U-boat patrol in the Atlantic and write a morale-boosting account of its mission . This experience provided the basis for his 1973 novel , Das Boot , which inspired this film . Buchheim also wrote a trilogy of non-fiction books about the Battle of the Atlantic , the first of which is available in English translation [ The U-Boat War ( 1986 ) ] .In its day , Das Boot was one of the most expensive films ever produced . Most of the money went into the sets . Especially noteworthy is the set for the U-boat 's interior , which was carefully constructed to replicate all the equipment of a real submarine , and mounted on a gimbal that could impart movements to simulate waves , dives , and depth charges . The set was engineered so that water could rush in and fire could break out in its confines . The camera man was forced to work in very restricted spaces and dash through the set filming the actors with his special gyro-stabilized camera . As portrayed in Das Boot , sailors were a diverse lot , but in crises they set their varying personalities and political philosophies aside and assume their assigned roles . They take some satisfaction from sinking ships , but this is tempered by discomfort or remorse over the merchant seamen they killed . U-boat existence was dispiriting , with long periods of boredom alternating with sheer terror as crewmen fought against an unseen enemy for their very lives . Casting is excellent , especially compelling is Jurgen Prochnow as the steely-eyed captain . Herbert Gr & ouml ; nemeyer as the young correspondent Werner [ i.e. , Buchheim ] , and Klaus Wennermann as the Chief Engineer give strong performances . Hubertus Bengsch and Martin Semmelrogge give credibility to the First and Second Watch Officers , respectively -- two very different characters . The sound effects , enhanced in the most recent versions , make you feel you are actually on the boat.Several versions of Das Boot have been released . The 150-minute theater version ( 1981 ) , the 209-minute Director 's Cut version ( 1997 ) , and the 293-minute version ( 2004 ) from which a six-episode television series was derived . The 293-minute version provides more information about individual crew members and everyday life on the ship . The 209-minute version gives insights into the officers ' personalities ( but neglects the other crewmen ) . The 150-minute theater version concentrates on action scenes . The nature of your interests may determine which version you prefer . The Director 's Cut version offers the original German audio as well as dubbed English and Spanish , with subtitles available in English , Spanish , and French . Extras include a feature about the making of the film , and voice-over commentary by the director and others.In one of the peripherals ( The Making of Das Boot ) , star Jurgen Prochnow asserts , `` The whole thing happened . That 's a true story -- exactly like it was . '' That is not entirely true . The U-96 actually sailed from St. Nazaire , not La Rochelle . If the U-96 's crew were optimistic in setting out at the beginning of the film ( October 1941 ) , it was not due to their inexperience , but because the U-96 had already survived six patrols , and a patrol was not yet the semi-suicidal venture it was later to become . British anti-submarine measures had become much more effective by late 1941 , but the U-boats responded by moving their operations away from the most heavily patrolled seas . Sinkings by U-boats did not peak until November 1942 . The decisive turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic actually came in May 1943 , when over 40 U-boats were lost ( compared with 4 lost in November 1941 ) . In real life , U-96 's periscope would have been raised to a level at which the captain 's view was not obscured by waves ; and almost every encounter with British anti-submarine vessels would have featured the pinging of the asdic apparatus they used to locate submerged U-boats . In the film , messages are decoded with a four-rotor Enigma machine ; but the German navy actually continued using three-rotor machines until February 1942.But all this is small-minded nitpicking . Das Boot is not intended to be a reenactment of a particular patrol ; it is , rather , a microcosm of the whole U-boat war . Yet , in many ways , the film closely follows the U-96 's seventh patrol ( Oct. 27 , 1941-Dec. 6 , 1941 ) . The U-96 was an actual ship ; and it really had for its emblem the laughing sawfish that appears on the conning tower of the movie vessel . The harbor scenes were shot in World War II era German submarine bunkers . Bread and fresh produce customarily were tucked into every available space when a U-boat was provisioned . Bucheim really did take thousands of photographs while on board . The unscheduled encounter with another U-boat ( U-572 ) actually did take place -- Buchheim 's photo of the event is reproduced on the cover of Time-Life 's The Battle of the Atlantic ( 1977 ) . And many U-boats were ordered to the Mediterranean ( by Hitler himself ) to protect ships carrying supplies to German forces in Africa.Viewers might assume that , in diving to depths of 150 meters and below , U-boats were senselessly courting disaster . In fact , there were reasons for doing so . During the first two years of the war , the British did not realize the depths to which U-boats could dive . Thus , U-boats could dive well below the depths at which depth charges were set to explode . It was only after they captured U-570 in the summer of 1941 that the British discovered their mistake and set their depth charges to explode at deeper depths . Apart from this factor , the increased water pressure at greater depths confined the explosive impact of depth charges . In other words , at greater depths , depth charges had to explode closer to a U-boat in order to be effective . Needless to say , the greater the depth to which a U-boat dived , the more difficult it became for anti-submarine vessels to locate it precisely ( asdic was not infallible ) , and to set their depth charges to explode in sufficient proximity to damage the U-boat.It appears that the film 's principal characters were based to some extent on their real-life equivalents . `` Leutnant Werner '' represents Buchheim himself , a young man who found U-boat life much more harrowing than he imagined . The captain is based on Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock , one of the top U-boat `` aces , '' who had joined the navy in the pre-Nazi years and may have been among the navy officers who were not imbued with Nazism . The pro-Nazi First Watch Officer was clearly patterned on Gerhard Groth , who was born in Mexico . The film portrays the Second Watch Officer , who evidently represents Werner Hermann , as a rather irreverent and mischievous person -- and Hermann 's cadet class was remembered for its pranks . Judging by photographs , Bengsch ( cast as Groth ) and Semmelrogge ( cast as Herman ) may have been selected for their physical resemblance to the characters they portrayed . The Chief Engineer was probably based on Friedrich-Wilhelm Grade . Apparently , all of these men survived the war.From a German perspective , only 10 U-boats were more successful than the U-96 . After 11 patrols , it became a training vessel , and it survived until it was destroyed by American bombs in March 1945 . In the course of the war , not a single crew member died in combat on the U-96 . In real life , U-96 was a lucky boat .	1
& quot ; Das Boot & quot ; is certainly one of the most exciting , moving and involving films about combat ( here in a particularly intense theatre of war ) ever made , and also one of the great stories of the sea . Acting , camerawork , dialogue and direction are all superb . We grow to know the characters so well and to be at times stomach-churningly involved in their bleak yet heroic ordeal.In this respect and others it shares some interesting similarities to & quot ; The Wages of Fear & quot ; , especially the ending . How it was overlooked for any gong at all at the Oscars is baffling and pitiful . A masterpiece - you have to see it !	1
Unlike the typical Hollywood submarine movie , this one shows what is a more realistic -- and hence more gripping -- study of men under severe stress . No square-jawed John Wayne characters here , just ordinary but brave men caught up in a war machine . It shows their ambivalence at sinking unarmed freighters as it conflicts with their natural patriotism . The grime , claustrophobia , and boredom , suddenly punctuated with terror , indicates what life must have been like for these brave souls.The movie is in German , with subtitles , which are easy to read and do not detract from the experience since most conversation is terse and to the point .	1
What 's all this empathy for the poor germans ? Let 's not forget , these guys were nazis working for hitler . I was totally stoked that they got blasted at the end , like it should have been . That being said - love this film - dubbed version is unacceptable .	1
I really enjoyed the movie . Although , I wish it had been a little longer . The snake looks really scary - particulalrly the last 20 minutes are really awsome and full of action . A must see for those who love movies like jaws and godzilla . Highly recommended . However , if you did not like jaws or godzilla , you probably wo n't like this movie either .	1
When a Documentary Crew ( Jennifer Lopez , Ice Cube , Jonathan Hyde , Owen Wilson , Kari Wuhrer , Eric Stoltz and Vicent Casterllanos ) are going to the Amazon for the search of a tribe of Legendary Indians , But when they pick up a Mysterious Snake Pocher ( Jon Voight at his most campiest role ) , he ` s on the Hunt of a Forty Foot Snake , which it ` s has been following them since the Boat Trip.Directed by Luis Liosa ( Sniper , The Specialist ) has made one of the most campy Horror films ever made . Even the Computer Generated Imagery ( CGI ) are more campy . A Box Office Hit in the Spring of 1997 . This film will not be loved by everyone in the modern audiences but Fans of Camp Classics will love this one . Super 35 . Grade : B+ .	1
A documentary film crew is terorized by a giant snake in the Amazon , which they find thenselves trying to capture after rescuing a crazy shipwrecked big game hunter !	1
At its core , Anaconda is just another cheesy , giant snake flick . It did , however , manage to wrangle in an impressive cast of the following people : Jennifer Lopez , Eric Stoltz , Owen Wilson , Jon Voight , Ice Cube , Kari Wuhrer , and Jonathan Hyde . How in the heck they all got roped into this movie is beyond me , but I can only assume the casting director is presently selling the Moon 's real estate to Hollywood yuppies.Anway , a film crew in Brazil is searching for a reclusive , indigenous tribe known as the People of the Mist . While they are floating down the river , they happen to run into a man on a stranded ship . This man , Paul Sarone ( Jon Voight ) , is a big game snake hunter with the skill for capturing anacondas , the ponytail of a squalid biker , and the ability to butcher whatever accent he 's attempting . He tells the crew , led by Dr. Steven Cale ( Stoltz ) and his girlfriend Terri Flores ( Lopez ) , that he knows where the POTM are , but his offer to be a guide is laced with the ulterior motive to hunt down the biggest anaconda known to man . He plans to capture it , and sell it to a zoo for a fortune.Within no time , Eric Stoltz is bed-ridden after the worst tracheotomy in history , JLo is running around in wet clothes , Owen Wilson has a broken nose , Kari Wuhrer is serving her purpose in the movie by showing skin , and Ice Cube utters one of my favorite lines in movie history : `` Dey 's snakes out there ` dis big ? ! '' Evidently , `` Yes . Dey is . `` The plot , characters , and storyline are all relatively inconsequential . It 's just a fun movie to watch , as the cast fights until the end to save their lives from the insatiable - and apparently 50-foot long - anaconda that not only eats its prey , but also seems to recognize old foes , and enjoys playing with them.Great movie .	1
this is an awsome and like othe creatcure feature it got more than one star which is good for a creature feateure.great special effects and great action.great acting and i love the snake all the colers the first part where the snake comes up and eates matoe was a great f/x part.this movie sould be rated R in all the other parts os the .u.s.a and world this movie is rated R this movie does have lots of blood and some gore language and nudity .	1
This is the essence of a great popcorn movie . Lots of fun , and things jumping out and scaring the characters , and the audience . The weakest part of the film is the Anaconda , which looks very computer-generated ( because it is , of course ! ) . The director wisely keeps the snake shots to a minimum , and the result is a creepier picture .	1
This tape terrible It had me running out of the room instead of sitting there watching One of the best I ever watched .	1
The Professional is an interesting movie . It 's gritty , oddly matched characters and colors present something ... odd . Leon is lovable ... he is sexy and kind and hilarious , while still retaining the sadness that is due him , anywhere from watching Gene Kelly with ardour to his sleeping habits . Gary Oldman is a little over the top , but he 's still good and creepy , while being a believable drug addict . Natalie Portman is a brat ... her swearing was annoying , her dressing ridiculously provocative at points , her attitude unbearable , and her penchant for Jean Reno , or Leon , extremely creepy sometimes ( such as wearing his underwear to bed , telling the hotel manager that Leon was her lover , and telling him she was falling in love with him while they zoomed in on her stomach ) . The storyline was good , and thankfully they kept Leon refreshingly not-turned-on by her attempts to be close to him . It stays platonic enough to be enjoyable at parts , but Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) was over the top and pervertedly provocative , such as dancing in a bra and thong-over-tights while singing `` You Make Me Feel Like a Virgin '' to Leon . Thankfully Leon is just respectable and kind.The storyline is sad , such as Leon worked for years and years killing while being used by his `` friend '' Tony , then Mathilda being denied the money Leon desired her to have . The ending was extremely sad , but thankfully one gets the impression Mathilda will become better later in life.In Ronin , it is pointed out during director commentary how hard it is and what a beautiful thing it is to make a set look lived in or old and cruddy . They achieve this grittiness to perfection in The Professional , with all the different apartments Mathilda forces them to move in to . The clothes , unfortunately , excepting Leons , seem to hark back to mid-80s rather than mid-90s.Jean Reno was absolutely fantastic , lovable , and sympathetic as a man learning to live again , while still being able to kill . He 's smart , he just seems to have turned off his human side too long . Gary Oldman is creepy , a little over the top , but hateful in the good way while having his own almost endearing nuances . Mathilda is extremely annoying and creepy , but after watching it twice she did not bug me as much as the first time . She 's extremely believable in her idiocy.It was a good movie , Jean Reno was fantastic , however it is not a feel good movie , nor does it have crazy fighting sequences , though the ones they do have are good . A good movie to watch Jean Reno in .	1
I love this movie ! From beginning to end , it has no weak points . The acting is superb , Jean Reno , Gary Oldman , Natalie Portman ( first acting gig ! ) , Danny Aiello , and a couple of others that I left purposely out to encourage you to give it a second pass and laugh out loud to see them now and then . It has a very strong plot and motivation for them to continue their way of life . It has a little bit of everything , Drama , Action , Comedy , Sexual tones , but handle very well . The Blue ray edition comes packed with both films , the international version as it was supposed to be seen , and the constipated US version , which takes out like 15 minutes of precious film , bonus materials such as documentaries from the producers , and the cast . Luc Besson always exceeds expectations and this is no exception . This movie was made prior to start filming another classic of his , The Fifth Element , and he wrote it in like two weeks ! The sad thing about it , he did not made more sequels . ( Note , I read that a sequel to Leon is in the works ! Staring of course , Mathilda ! ) A classic that stands the test of time , grab it without hesitation and you too can become a cleaner ! ! !	1
Brilliant acting with a unique story . Its a different take on your typical action or & # 34 ; manly & # 34 ; movie . Gary Oldman plays the antagonist brilliantly as always . Natalie Portman and Jean Reno give a realistic and unique performance that makes the show . Its not really a & # 34 ; fast action thrill ride & # 34 ; but there is still plenty of action and plot twists to keep it interesting .	1
This is a movie that would be hard to like if it were explained to you in a literal sense . A movie about a 40 something Italian hitman that falls in love with a 12 year old girl . But it is much more than the parts that make it a movie.First off the bat it ignores a lot of stereotypes that existed at that time about hitmen , especially Italian ones that worked for a face that is played up to be part of La Cost Nostra , even it if is n't said outright . He doesnt ' wear Armani Suits , eat spaghetti , sleep with high class floozies , or hang out at bars bragging about who he has done in all while drinking shots and snorting coke . No , he is a quiet introvert , that does his job , and meticulously focuses on his quiet and simple life . He is illiterate , has only one real friend , cares for his plant like it was a pet , and loves going out to musicals . Which , the latter is a great scene , seeing a hardened killer smiling like he was a 10 year old boy while watching muscials at a nearly empty theater was classic . Plus the more you get to know of his character the more you realize he is stunted emotionally , flawless killer , but unable to handle simple social interaction.Natalie Portman shows her talent in her first role as the rebellious daughter of a drug handler . She shows not only her potential for being a great actress , but intelligence in this role . Where she falls in love with a hitman and is dead set on avenging the death of her little brother , the one person in her dysfunctional family she cares for.Gary Oldman is in his classic evil form as a drug addicted DEA agent that has crossed the line . True , he does overdo the character , but that is what makes it fun . Watching him pop some green pill , chatter about Bethoven , then procede to break into an apartment killing everyone in it was one of the best parts of the film.The camera angles and the characters in this movie are fresh and gritty . Not falling to sterotypes , they make you feel like you are really in New York , sweating along with the cop in a bad suit and five o'clock shadow.The love story is bizarre , but works in the end . Two misfits , that find each other and help pull themselves out of their downward spiraling lives.This is a powerful movie that I think everyone should experience . It hits on many levels and appeals to many different types of people , people who like to view films as artwork to those who just like an action flick , this movie will deliver . Though I was tempted to take away a star since I did n't like the additions of the directors cut , the power still holds . See the theatrical release first , then watch the directors cut . Afterwards you can pick your favorite and watch them over and over again .	1
Early in Luc Besson 's film , `` Leon '' ( aka The Professional ) , we learn that only master assassins work up close , with their hands or a knife . If that 's true then Besson must consider himself a master director as this movie takes the audience up close and personal with some fascinating but ultimately doomed characters.If it seems the title role was written for Jean Reno , that 's only because it was . He plays an Italian hit-man who works in New York . Like many immigrants , he is isolated within the new and unfamiliar world . He shares a squalid little apartment with one plant and leaves only to buy provisions , visit his friend , ( and manager ) , Tony , and occasionally see an old movie at the local cinema . His life would be small and insignificant if it were n't for the fact that he is a ruthless killer , working for the Mob.The genius of this film is that it somehow convinces the audience to feel sympathy towards a brutal assassin . This `` Professional '' is portrayed as somehow fragile while at the same time being perfectly dangerous . He ca n't read English , does n't speak much and is clearly being short-changed by Tony , a slick Italian `` Family '' man played gently by Danny Aiello . When trouble visits Leon 's little unit block , he does n't venture out but prefers to watch from the safety of his door 's spy-hole.This particular trouble comes in the form of detective Norman Stansfield , a crooked cop who arrives to visit one of his drug couriers who stupidly gambles his life in an effort to increase his slice of the business . Stansfield , played brilliantly by Gary Oldmam , is a pill-popping psychotic whose only redeeming feature seems to be a love of classical music . Sadly he sees parallels between famous concertos and savage gun battles . In this case , his shotgun version of Beethoven leaves the entire family dead in their apartment ; all but 12-year-old Mathilda.Natalie Portman 's first major cinematic role , as Mathilda , is impressive . She has to project a broad range for a child character . After growing up as a drug dealer 's daughter and then losing even that small security , she is both vulnerable and street smart . And , after convincing Leon to take her in , she also starts to explore her budding sexuality , ( a foreshadowing of her role in Beautiful Women ) .In our politically correct world , 12-year-old girls are not meant to be sexually attractive but that does n't stop Besson from designing scenes where young Mathilda makes serious attempts to seduce the shy Leon . It 's unclear whether she truly feels love or is simply trying to ensure her new place in the world . The result is a strong bond between the two unlikely companions , more familial than sexual . In the end , it is this bond that forces Leon to abandon his years of caution.This is a film that combines a perfect cast with inspired direction , European cinematography and the characteristic score of Eric Serra to create a powerful , sometimes disturbing , experience that will stay with you for years to come .	1
I have come to believe that no matter how poor the script , or how small the part , If Jean Reno is in the film , the thing 's worth watching . Of all the Reno/Besson films , this is the only one I 've seen where Reno is TRULY allowed to display the astonishing depths of his tallent and ability . As the character Leon , he granted the space and time to show the world that HE is this generation 's MOST phenominally able performer . With the exception some absurd & unsubtle `` overacting '' by the performer who played the main `` villian '' - all the supporting performances are superb . They team up with Monsieur Reno to make an already amazing story & script into an undisputible masterpiece of filmaking.I heartily wish that Reno would make more American films , and with equal earnestness , I wish he would look to directors other than Luc Besson . Frankly , talent wise , Reno is WAY out of Besson 's league ; a fact that is painfully obvious in most of Jean Reno 's Besson directed films . Generally , the material is beneath him ; it is simply not good enough for Reno to even bother with .	1
Forget about the American cut , this is the way Besson intended for this film to be seen . At the heart of it , Leon is a love story between a grown hitman with the emotions of a child , and a child who 's rough life have made her mature beyond her years . Both of these character traits are shown in more depth in the international version .	1
Very few action films are realistic , which them very hard to watch , at least for me . When I was going through Army Special Forces training in the late 90'2 we watched the sreet fight scene from the movie Heat and the scene in The Professional where the police are entering Leon 's apartment . Classic lessons learned films . This movie is a must watch for anyone for a variety of reasons . It 's about shady friends , dysfunctional families , and a love and strong bond formed by a man and 11 y/o girl who come from those respective situations . They join forces to exact revenge on the cops that killed her family and baby brother . This a must see film and one of the best action movies ever !	1
ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES ! ! !	1
The directors define their job as storytelling . That 's what my review will be about.I first watched this movie when I was at Mathilda 's age so it was a great timing so I could communicate with the character while watching the movie . Now , at the age of 20 , I bought the DVD with additional footage and watched the movie again with a whole different eye . I wo n't write anything about the story . I thought the story was good enough for an american movie . Still I think so . The acting was topnotch , especially Natalie Portman . When you watch a child actor for the first time in a movie , you measure his/her acting realated to the age . You say & quot ; Good for a child & quot ; . But Natalie plays like she 's a professional actress doing this for a long time , which doubles the success of the movie . Because mostly , if there 's a child actor in the movie , you dislike it because you dislike the child 's acting.So , there are great actors/actresses , there 's a good plot , there 's great ending , which is 50 % of any movie I think , and there 's great score by Eric Serra . ( There 's isolated score in the DVD for soundtrack fans like me ) But there are some glitches related to the & quot ; storytelling & quot ; . My favorite director is Robert Zemeckis because I like the way he tells his story . Steven Spielberg and James Cameron are also great storytellers , also Lucas . Besson is also good but he 's a little bit light.If you watched Fight Club , you 'll understand what I mean . There are several ways to tell stories . One is & quot ; Fight Club & quot ; style I think . There 's no logic in what you see but there 's logic in the plot . One is Zemeckis Style . He tells really seriously his stories , you do n't see anything which you can not see . But he does with a great magic.Some directors ( weak ones ) ca n't catch any of the two spirits I mentioned above . Besson , I think is between being Zemeckis and weak . There are incredibly great moments in the movie , especially the final . But there are some freebee editing and storytelling thoroughout the movie , so it makes the movie 4 stars instead of 5 . But again , it 's one of the best movies made in & quot ; Hollywood & quot ; so far because it 's real , even though it 's a bit heroic . The love though , is not so much believable because Matilda is too young . But hey , I 'm not from America , and I 'm not a girl . Still , it doubts me if Matilda can really fall in love with Leon.So , you know the movie , buy this edition and get the real movie not the censored one .	1
One of my favorite movies . Story of a likeable , gullable , professional hitman ( Leon ) who 's really , really good at his job . Natalie Portman is a 9 year old who 's just lost her parents to a hit . Leon reluctantly helps to keep her from the people who killed her parents.The primary character trying to take her out is a cop who 's one of the most psycho , ruthless characters you 'll see.It 's a bang , bang , shoot-em up guy movie , with a softer side as Natalie Portman wants to adopt him as her `` new '' family ; and Leon turns his attention from his job to helping her .	1
After her drug-dealer father and family are murdered , 12 year-old Matilda ( Natalie Portman ) is effectively adopted by Leon ( Jean Reno ) , the nice man in the apartment next door who just happens to be a hit-man . Leon then proceeds to teach Matilda his trade so that she can exact revenge on her family 's killers . `` Leon '' is one of the most unusual films that I have ever seen and also one of the best . Without a doubt , it is the best of Luc Besson 's films . In a video store , this film would probably be placed in the action section , but although it contains a number of ( very violent ) action scenes , I do n't really see this film as being an action film in the same sense that something like `` Die Hard '' is . It is more a study of the relationship between Leon and Matilda , and a very good one at that . Leon and Matilda are two extremely damaged people who manage to find love ( albeit platonic love ) with each other . The fact that they find this love through activities that most people would consider to be less than desirable just adds to this film 's charm . It is also a study of innocence , contrasting Leon 's child-like nature ( the look on Reno 's face as he watches a Gene Kelly movie is priceless ) with that of an actual child.Everything about this film is excellent . From Besson 's script and directing to Reno , Portman and Gary Oldman as the film 's three leads . Although made in English with mostly American actors ( except for Reno , who , bizarrely , plays an Italian ) and targeted at the American/International market , this is , in fact , a French film and is stylistically more European than American , and in my opinion , is all the better for it . I just saw this film for the second time last night and I already want to re-watch it . I can not recommend this film enough .	1
This is an awesome suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.It 's full of surprises that you will love.Another great French movie is LA FEMME NIKITA .	1
Leon : The Professional is a splendid thriller with some of the best acting in a while . It has Luc Besson ( The Fifth Element ) giving his directorial debut and Natalie Portman making her actorial debut . First off , let me tell you that it is n't an action movie like Blockbuster says it is . No , it 's a touching drama that can turn into an action movie or thriller in an instant.It has Jean Reno staring as Leon , a hitman , the best of his kind . He lives in an apartment building and his room is accross from little Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) , a 12 year old girl who is abused by her parents . That is soon to change though . An insane killer cop ( Gary Oldman ) literally whipes out her whole family because of some drugs . Mathilda is devastated..not for her parents but for her little brother . She moves in with Leon and they bond . Leon teaches her how to `` clean '' ( kill people ) and she teaches him how to read , cook , etc.. These moments are the best..the interaction between Leon and her . Splendid to watch.The movie is a sad tale of love and war..a wonderful thriller ... or drama..or action ... The acting is amazing notably by Gary Oldman who steals the show . He is in my opinion the best secondary actor of all time and his savage attitude and his darkly comic moments add so much to this movie.The score is fantastic with a great beath that goes along with the flow of the movie . Now for the end . The ending is awesome packing action a plenty and for guys , it 's just really cool . The last part with the plant is touching and a great conclusion and this movie is a definite success..and one of my faves . So , please watch this genius movie with everything be it drama , comedy , action , suspense and a GENIUS cast .	1
When a girl survives of a brutal and multiple homicide will be at the end of the story in his only friend . The loneliness join its forces with the hopeless . She is only 12 years old while he is cold assassin . Consider the odds and make your own conclusions . The original idea vanishes slowly and turns in another thriller with peaks and lows .Nevertheless the opening and dazzling shot is admirable . There are a good camera work and the film plays hard with your feelings . Deeply compelling , not for all tastes , the movie is an intersection between the American thriller and the European gaze filled with those reminiscences so typical of the fifties . This is the film who made so well known to Jean Reno.It 's a neo film noir .	1
I adore this film , primarily ( though not only ) for one reason : Natalie Portman . Her performance left me with my jaw on the floor for most of the film when I first saw it , and I still ca n't help but watch her in awe when I load it up again now and then . Prior to seeing this film , I had only seen her in Phantom Menace , and at the time , I simply could n't understand what all the fuss about her talent was ... her wooden-seeming performance as Princess Amidala left me quite indifferent . But now that I 've seen her incredible brilliance in its most potent form - here in this film when she was still amazingly young , I believe she is indeed one of this generation 's greatest and most unique talents . I am a huge fan of Jean Reno and Luc Bisson as well , but I find that their talents are diluted whenever they are & quot ; anglicized/americanized & quot ; as in this film . In their native french , they are both marvels of the screen . La Femme Nikita is another , better example ; I remember hating the american/dubbed version of it , but loving the original . The plot itself is ok , but nothing spectacular , and as for Gary Oldman , although he can often be wonderful in his performances , in this movie he really misses . I 'm not sure if he took the method school of acting too much to heart and enjoyed some of the drugs that his character did before his scenes , but whatever the reason , & quot ; over the top & quot ; ( as described by many other reviewers ) is putting it mildly.As for this uncut version , there is no reason for anyone to own any other version of the film ; the american release ( & quot ; The Professional & quot ; ) is an insult to both the director 's vision and to the audience.Even now , I have a difficult time watching the ending of this film ; it leaves me teary-eyed and with a lump in my throat that does n't go away for hours , and the primary reason is again Natalie Portman 's unbelievable performance . After watching her in this film , you 'll find it almost impossible to believe that you 're watching a 13/14-year-old actress . Get this film to witness true acting brilliance in the making ; the great action is just a bonus .	1
While this story requires a bit of suspension of disbelief ( all that shooting , for instance , would have attracted immediate attention from neighbors and the authorities ) , the portrayals of the characters are superb . Young Natalie Portman was particularly stellar . Cynics might suggest that the child she played could never in real life have had the focus and desire to have learned the assassin 's trade ( as tought to her by The Professional ) -- but such thinking collapses if you consider that the real-life Natalie had all the personal discipline necessary for making this film , and doing such a great job of it , at her youthful age .	1
Like most fans of this modern-day action classic , I was unaware that an alternate version with additional footage existed.After reading a review of & quot ; Leon , The Professional , & quot ; I decided to order the DVD and was not dissappointed . If you never understood that this movie is really a love story and not an action film , this version will make it crystal clear . While the original holds up well , Luc Besson 's Director 's Cut adds depth and complexity to the relationship between Leon ( Jean Reno ) and Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) .Of course , this may be the very reason why some fans will still prefer the original US theatrical release of the film . The additional footage causes the film to drag in spots and for those fans who just want carnage this may be a downer.These scenes also show the 12-year-old Mathilde 's growing romantic infatuation with Leon . Though Besson handles this responsibly and with sensitivity , it is nonetheless sure to make some viewers queasy.Nevertheless , for open-minded viewers who like a little character development with their bulletfests , & quot ; Leon , The Professional & quot ; is clearly the superior version.My only complaints are this : First , it would have made far more sense to have waited to release this film as a & quot ; Terminator 2 : Judgement Day & quot ; -style & quot ; Ultimate Edition & quot ; that included both the original US cut and the Director 's Cut on one disc . That way viewers could 've had the best of both worlds . Many die-hard fans of this movie likely already own & quot ; The Professional & quot ; on DVD and are now going to be debating whether or not they want to buy & quot ; Leon , The Professional & quot ; for the additional footage.Secondly , this DVD is remarkably light on extras . Other than the obligatory trailers , the only other item of note is a set of still photos showing variant promo-posters from around the world.Given that this is a Director 's Cut , a commentary from Besson explaining why he edited out the restored scenes for the original American release would 've been quite enlightening.But the real reason to own this DVD is the film itself . Unlike all too many all too many directors who do n't understand that some & quot ; lost & quot ; footage should stay lost , Besson has done us a service by making this version available to fans .	1
There is a difference between things we like and things which are good . The Professional ( aka Leon ) is n't very good . It 's the story of a guy who gets paid a lot of money to kill people , and there 's nothing particularly revealing or insightful about this . In fact , quite the opposite . The title character is very cool . Movie assassins are cool . It 's neat to watch Jean Reno shoot people . But it 's a comic book , in the very worst sense of the term . It 's utterly unrealistic and the only things that are enjoyable about it depend entirely on that unrealism . Luc Besson does n't know any more about assassins than your dentist does . It 's absolutely escapism.That being said , it 's a hell of a lot of fun . Extremely enjoyable . Lots of fun to watch with your friends , particularly because there 's not a lot of dialog , so you can comment over the action . It 's not the type of movie that you need to own , however . It 's so broadly drawn , exactly like a cartoon , that as soon as you *think* about it , much less look at the cover of the movie , everything in it instantly comes back to you , and you 'll find yourself looking for something that 's even minutely rewarding to watch more than once.Gary Oldman , on the same really dedicated drug binge that carried him through most of the 90s , is just one notch too high . It 's possible to see that he could have turned in a performance that would scare you , but he opted to play it over the top . This was probably a bad idea , although he 'd ratchet it up even further in The 5th Element.When this movie first came out , many reviewers were disturbed by the relationship between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman . Others tried to dismiss this by claiming it was familial rather than romantic . Both sides are wrong . Leon has the mind of a child . Intellectually and emotionally , he 's younger than Natalie Portman 's character . Their relationship is puppy love , so it 's romantic in whatever limited sense puppy love can be , but that 's all . There 's nothing morally dangerous here , no-one 's going to be corrupted by this movie , except insofar as it might lead them to confuse things they like with things that are good .	1
Purchased for my dad who wanted this for Christmas he loved it . Would recommend and has definitely held up . Thanks	1
young natalie portmens parents are cokeheads they rob gary oldman a crooked cop so he kills them all the lil girl escapes to an apartment nextdoor who happens to be occupied by an italian hitman he starts to feel a bond with her like shes is his daughter so he agrees to help her get revenge and teach her how to be a hitman they start visiting the men who killed her family and showing them street justice eventually she starts falling in love with the older man but even though hes a hitman hes good hearted and only views her as his child and rejects her advances a slick powerful classic film with a must see ending this movies alot like heat and pulp fiction its a great film that should be in your collection this uncut version is the one to own	1
`` The Professional '' is the thinking man 's action flick . After seeing the original Americanized watered-down version , I was hooked . With the release of the uncut edition , many loose ends from the editied version are tied up . Perhaps the most compelling aspect is the inclusion of more of Leon 's backstory , which helps audiences more closely relate to the hitman . I reccomend this version for anyone who enjoys a good action movie and can tolerate some violence and profanity.As a side note , I bought this edition and had no problems with the video track -- mine was mastered fine and worked properly , so I assume that the disc a customer made mention of on this site was part of a faulty batch of discs that was later corrected .	1
REALLY GREAT ! IT WAS DONE LIKE A FOREIGN FILM , BUT I REALLY LOVED THE WAY IT WAS DONE . AND THE ACTING WAS GREAT !	1
Kudos to Sony/Columbia Pictures for this spectacular Blu-Ray copy . They really did a great job in giving justice to this timeless gem of a film , the video and audio transfer are top notch . This is also the first time I have seen the extended edition and must say it simply completes the connection between Leon ( Jean Reno ) and Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) , Gary Oldman is simply superb . The special feature section they have included are all brilliant , the honest and insightful comments given by the actors and the cast and crew involved are very much welcome . Thank You Luc Besson for this lovely film .	1
This a very interesting Movie . Natalie Portman as a little girl tooks up to the Man who saves her from Dangerous Criminals that just happen to work for the DEA ! !	1
I wo n't review the movie ; There are plenty of reviews of this wonderful flick elsewhere . Instead , I 'm reviewing the format offered here : VOD.Simply put , even though they show the box which includes both the American Theatrical and Extended editions ( `` The Professional '' and `` Leon '' , respectively ) , this download appears to only include `` The Professional '' , and thus omits the extra 24 minutes of this movie which make such a huge difference to the story.I would encourage you to grab the disc instead , as the heavily-edited American theatrical version is lacking . There are plot points which are never properly explained , and wonderful moments when Mathilda is trained to be a `` Cleaner '' that were deemed too `` sensitive '' for American viewers . `` The Professional '' is still an awesome film , but I 'd really prefer it if AVOD would put `` Leon '' here instead , and stop leading searches for `` Leon '' to this product ; They 're not the same movie .	1
I 've not got much to add from what hasn'already been said , a classic film , superb directing from the Frenchman Luc Besson , and it 's good to so many people around the world who log onto Amazons superb website have such good taste.Oh yeah , its Known as LEON in Europe .	1
One of my all time favorite movies , and has a cute love story . Very well made , and Gary Oldman is wonderful as the insane cop . One of the movies I watch again , every few months .	1
The Professional is simply professionally done . I love the layout of the story line and the actors . Gary Oldman makes a fantastic performance as usual . I love all of the psychotic syndictive dark characters he plays as in this one . That 's what makes a movie live . If you 've never seen this move than buy it . The ending is the saddest part of the movie , it 's well worth it . I love the song . Sting-Shape Of My Heart .	1
Firstly can I just say Octavius does n't know what he 's talking about . The plot here is not ridiculous , yes this sort of thing may not happen very often in real life but its a movie ... .DUH ! This film is not perverse in any way , they have a father daughter relationship , what is perverse about this ? Her real Dad did n't care about her so she looked to Leon as a father figure and Leon was a loner who had no family and meeting Mathilda , as he said , gave him a thurst for life and he did n't want to be a killer any more , so your point that he should n't care about the girl is ridiculous , everyone is capable of loving & caring for someone no matter what you do for a living . And you say he is n't professional ? Did you see the way he killed people ? Or were you watching a different movie ? This is one of the best movies ever , I can watch it again & again , its so moving . The acting is superb , Jean Reno , Natalie Portman , Gary Oldman & Danny Aiello give phenominal performances . Video quality is excellent with some really nice shots of NYC .	1
True classic movie . A must own for movie collectors . Amazing movie .	1
Mathilda , a twelve-year old New York girl , is living an undesirable life among her half-family . Her father stores drugs for two-faced cop Norman Stansfield . Only her little brother keeps Mathilda from breaking apart . One day , Stansfield and his team take cruel revenge on her father for stretching the drugs a little , thus killing the whole family . Only Mathilda , who was out shopping , survives by finding shelter in L & eacute ; on 's apartment in the moment of highest need . Soon , she finds out about the strange neighbour 's unusual profession , killing and desperately seeks his help in taking revenge for her little brother . L & eacute ; on , who is completely unexperienced in fatherly tasks , and in friendships , does his best to keep Mathilda out of trouble unsuccessfully . Now , the conflict between a killer , who slowly discovers his abilities to live , to feel , to love and a corrupt police officer , who does anything in his might to get rid of an eye witness , arises to unmeasurable proportions - all for the sake of a little twelve-year old girl , who has nearly nothing to lose . Luc Besson 's movie L & eacute ; on `` The Professional '' gives a intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler . Every aspect of the movie delivers and makes an impressive overall package . A gripping story with well-crafted characters .	1
good show . a little odd when this 35 yo odd ball falls in love with a 12 yo girl and she him . but their relationship is actually kinda precious . they needed each other . the revenge part could have been better worked out . I think for morals sake he had to die . otherwise they would of had to figure out what to do with the relationship . that would have been difficult writing . enjoy .	1
Lots of personality and such a wealth of story surrounding the power of food and relationships . Have some wine and food while you watch it : ) !	1
What better compliment can I give to Big Night than to say it 's a simple story , well told . It celebrates the pleasures of good food and the pressures of brotherhood . The centerpiece of Big Night is the culinary orgy of traditional Mediterranean dishes served with the the finest of care to the most captive of audiences . It 's not long before we realize that the guest of honor is just a ruse , but who cares . Dish after dish is placed before us , and we ca n't help but gasp at the beauty and wonder of their banquet.In the end , the dilemma of Primo and Secondo is the artist 's as well : does one give the people what they want or teach them to like what they have n't tried before ? In Big Night , Tucci shows us that it can indeed be both .	1
This is a really great movie that many people probably have not heard about , but would know almost everyone in the movie . Its a story of 2 brothers struggling to keep a restaurant open . Highly recommend this one .	1
I saw this movie many years ago and when I was looking for something to watch the other night I decided to revisit it . The food and music is fabulous ! The acting is superb ! I highly recommend it !	1
Stanley Tucci , as actor , co-writer , and co-director ( with Campbell Scott , who also plays a pitch-perfect small part as a car salesman ) , deserves a great deal of the credit for this small , intimate , delightful film . But the film resonates because it got so many of the little touches right , from the ensemble cast to the soundtrack to the editing to the cinematography . So there is a lot of credit to go around.Tucci plays Secondo , the aptly named younger of two Italian brothers who have emigrated to New Jersey from the Old Country . Secondo is the entrepreneur , the guy who wants the big Cadillac . Primo ( Tony Shahloub ) , the older brother , is the magician of a chef . Primo is so good , in fact , that his culinary masterpieces go over the heads of the good folks of New Jersey . When contemplating a wonderful seafood risotto , a diner complains that she ca n't see the seafood , and that her desired side of spaghetti does n't come with meatballs ( inspiring the wonderful line , & quot ; Sometimes spaghetti wants to be alone & quot ; ) .Primo bemoans the fact that he is serving food to Philistines , but the sad fact is that most of the Philistines are eating across the street at Pascal 's restaurant . Pascal , played with great zest by Ian Holm , knows that you have to give the customer what he wants -- even if it is culinary sacrilege . The contrasts between the restaurants , from the colors to the lighting to the clientele , could not be more staggering ! Secondo laments to Pascal of his financial woes , but refuses Pascal 's ( repeated ) offer to come work for him . Pascal , being a big-hearted guy , tells Secondo to pull of a & quot ; big night , & quot ; with no holds barred . Pascal will invite his good friend , Louis Prima , who will come , eat , and love Secondo 's restaurant . Then , the people will come.So the story builds to the big night ( a side plot regarding Secondo 's tortured love life notwithstanding ) , which is where the movie really takes off.Organizing the banquet scene into courses , & quot ; Big Night & quot ; revels in the wonders that can only be brought about by great cooking . The cast has a difficult task -- how do you emote rapture without going over the top ? The ensemble cast , which includes Isabella Rosselini , Minnie Driver , and Allison Janney , nails this task just right . The cooking scenes are also hectic and impressive without going over the top , too.Following the big night , many truths are revealed , perhaps because it is impossible to deceive after having such a wondrous experience . If this film does n't move you , or inspire you to get thee hence to an Italian restaurant , you have no heart ! But again , the heart of the movie is its dedication to the small touches . From Primo using his cup to tamp down his espresso grounds to the making of a simple omelet , this movie gets it all just right.The DVD does not have much to offer as far as extras go . What it does have is one heck of little film .	1
Great film , in the clearest picture yet . Buy it you wo n't be let down . Oh yeah the audio quality is pretty good too !	1
None of us knows what it 's really like to go undercover . We think we do but we do n't . Sure , we 've watched the movies , read the books and all but what it 's doing to your soul , your family life , everything , that it destroys all you have and feel , that is what this movie is about.When Lefty ( Al Pacino as a low level mobster ) takes in Donnie ( Johnny Depp as an undercover FBI agent ) he tells him `` Wiseguys are always right . Even when they 're wrong they 're right , '' he is wrong . Dead wrong . He just does n't know it yet.Lefty treats Donnie as a son and Donnie gets emotionally involved . In his own way Lefty has a big heart , his hopes and dreams . But the dirt gets in the way and they do n't materialize.Bit by bit both Lefty 's and Donnie 's lives derail . Donnie starts losing his wife and kids and Lefty his rank in the ( crime ) family.Can they do anything to save what 's left ? Do they want to and if so , what is more important , life as it was , friendship or the uncertain future ? Does risking everything justify the costs ? Based on a true story this marvelous film shows the dirt as it is . Forget about the romance of other mobster movies and enter loyalty and misery . Both Al Pacino and Johnny Depp give larger than life performances . The supporting cast is terrific as is the directing . The 70s style indoor lighting helps turn it into a timeless masterpiece.The Blu-ray disc is sharp as can be . This one should be in your collection .	1
This movie is by far one of the best Mafia films ever made . Pacino is excellent , Madsen is fabulous , and Depp is great as well . The film sticks very close to the book , minus some Hollywood fabrications . That aside , if you are a fan of Cosa Nostra films , this is an absolute must for your collection .	1
It 's a superb movie -- one of the best depicting the true picture and psyche of the mafia . Johnny Depp is oustanding and Al Pacino gives one of his best performances ever in this movie .	1
the came on time and in great shape . donnie brasco is a great movie , if you like a good mob movie check it out .	1
Like Westerns , gangster films are a unique , American invention ; our fascination for these movies seems hard to understand at times , considering the amoral and destructive actions of the patriarchal characters involved . Perhaps in spite of these deficiencies , gangster movies allow us to look at criminals as human beings , as flawed and unfortunate as the rest of us . Donnie Brasco , far more than other movies in the genre , takes this possibility and turns it into the driving force behind its emotional impact . It is a welcome relief from the near-glorification of gangster life in late 80s and early 90s movies such as Casino , Scarface , and others , and it injected a much-needed dose of nitro . Donnie Brasco 's gangsters are n't your rich , creme de la creme godfathers - they are the underlings , involved in a lifestyle they can no longer refuse.The film follows FBI Agent Joe Pistone , who is undercover in Brooklyn as Donnie Brasco , jeweler ( Johnny Depp , in one of his best movie roles ) . After winning the trust and confidence of low-budget hitman & quot ; Lefty & quot ; ( Al Pacino , who should have been nominated for an Oscar ) , & quot ; Donnie & quot ; begins to move around in the New York underworld . When the old boss is & quot ; whacked , & quot ; another mobster seizes the opportunity and gains control , allowing & quot ; Donnie & quot ; to go further into the mob scene than any undercover cop ever did before . Eventually , the lines between work and self break down , making Donnie 's ultimate decision all the more visceral and real.Based on a true story , Donnie Brasco rings true throughout , uncompromising and unflinching . Depp and Pacino deliver outstanding performances , and Anne Heche , in a supporting role as Joe 's increasingly frustrated wife , shines in her best role to date . The plot , too , moves along at a steady clip , never losing momentum and never slipping into the easy , moralizing path this film could easily have taken . The only real problem was at the beginning of the film , where things seem to happen without much reason , but causes and effects are easily inferred.This DVD Special Edition has a very informative commentary track , and a few non-necessary deleted scenes . The picture and sound , however , are fantastic ; nary a scratch or dust spot on the print , and the sound is as clear and well-mixed as can be expected . The featurettes are interesting , but seem a little too short ( as do many DVD featurettes ) .The movie is bound to become a classic , not only in the gangster genre but in American filmmaking as well . It 's a special Special Edition , and definitely worth the cost . If you are a fan of the film , a fan of movies , or a fan of DVD , add this title to your collection as soon as you can .	1
An FBI undercover agent ( Depp ) infiltrates the mob by befriending a low-level mobster ( Pacino ) and finds himself being slowly drawn in to their sleazy world . A tough and unglamorous look at the workings of the mob in 1970 's New York with Johnny Depp and Al Pacino excellent in the lead roles . A memorable movie enhanced by a great blue-ray transfer .	1
Working undercover as a jewel dealer Joe Pistone ( Johnny Depp ) earns the trust of Lefty Ruggiero ( Al Pacino ) . Lefty vouches for Joe and brings him into his mob family . What was supposed to be a three-month assignment for Joe turns into several years . Joe begins to drift away from his own family and deep into the mob . He and Lefty form a strong bond and a father son relationship . When the investigation is coming to an end Joe realizes that his only way out of the mob is to betray his friend.The film is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen . It is a very nice transfer the only flaw I noticed was a hint of grain occasionally . A Dolby Digital 5.0 audio track is provided . The surround speakers are hardly used . When they are its mostly only for music . With a movie like this that is mostly dialogue its understandable . This special edition DVD has several extras . The highlights are a director 's commentary , two featurettes , deleted scenes and trailers . The featurette titled `` Donnie Brasco : Out of the Shadows '' was excellent . It gives a lot of background on the film and contains several interviews with the cast and crew . The deleted scenes are nice to see but I can understand why they were cut from the film.For those of you thinking this is just another mob movie , you are wrong . Instead of showing the top of the crime family tree like many other films this one shows the bottom . It shows soldiers that are scraping at the bottom of the barrel and are just trying to make ends meet . This is a film that stands on its own on many levels . It was perfectly cast with Johnny Depp , Al Pacino , Michael Madsen and Anne Heche . If you like mob movies or just fine acting this is one film you need to see .	1
Donnie Brasco follows Joseph D. Pistone , or Donnie Brasco , an undercover FBI agent that successfully infiltrated the mafia ; however , he eventually develops a genuine connection with the man who brought him in , Lefty . Donnie Brasco is a brilliant and immersive gangster drama.The story is very engaging and genuinely intriguing ; you learn a lot about the wiseguy lifestyle and the undercover operations of the FBI . There are many scenes that are extremely tense ; I constantly asked , `` how will Donnie get out of this one ? ! ? '' I really enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the film , especially when you realize how deep their connection was . Never a dull moment as the film masterfully blends immersive dialogue , intense situations , and some brutal violence throughout , with some comedy occasionally tossed in . Johnny Depp and Al Pacino have amazing performances ; Al Pacino particularly kept a consistent and realistic character throughout . The film also has a great soundtrack.The blu-ray of this film is excellent . The picture and sound quality are superb , considering the age of the film , and match the best prints around/recently released . This is the definitive version of this film.Overall , Donnie Brasco is a must-watch for fans of gangster/crime dramas ; in fact , it 's a must-watch for film fans in general . A superb and immersive storyline , magnificent performances , and an excellent soundtrack , do n't skip this film.Donnie Brasco has strong violence and blood , and brief nudity .	1
DONNIE BRASCO is a highly accurate and in depth look at the complexities involved in undercover police work . Based on the true story of Joe Pistone , BRASCO gives us an excellent cast , headed by Al Pacino and Johnny Depp , in showing us the underworld of the Mafia through the eyes of the guys on the lower end of the stick . Depp in his undercover role as a wiseguy to Pacino , endangers his married life ( Anne Heche in a strong performance ) , and finds himself becoming attached to Pacino , in spite of what he knows is going to happen in the future . Michael Madsen gives one of his best performances as Johnny Black , a mover who wants to take Depp away from Pacino . The film 's complexities question Depp 's role , especially when he tries to get Pacino to get out of the picture . Pacino is brilliant and manages to make a guy who has killed over 25 people sympathetic , and Depp is amazing in this unusual role , giving Brasco the audience 's compassion in his role of the betrayer . A fine gangster film well directed by Mike Newell .	1
The title of this review is a phrase said by one Benjamin & quot ; Lefty & quot ; Ruggerro . In the same way some war veterans talk of nothing but their heroics , struggles and the mechanics of their war , Lefty is obsessed with the mythology of the mafia . Toobad for him he is less a Godfather and more of a small fish on the mafia foodchain . The rest of that phrase is & quot ; ... and its your best friend that does it. & quot ; Donnie Brasco tells the story of undercover agent Joe Pistone 's ( Johnny Deppy ) ifilteration of the mob in 1978 . He introduces himself as & quot ; Don the jeweller & quot ; . He immediately gains the respect and love of Lefty ( Al Pacino ) , and he is presented to the rest of the crew as a & quot ; a friend of Lefty 's & quot ; . You see , if he is a & quot ; friend of Lefty 's & quot ; that means he is a connected guy , if he were a & quot ; friend of ours & quot ; that would make him a made guy.Donnie Brasco will not disappoint fans of the genre , it has all the mob talk , the back alley butcherings and the tense stand offs . But what makes the film the masterpiece that it is , the warm and brilliantly acted and realised central relationship between Donnie/Joe and Lefty . I read an interview with director Mike Newel where he called the film & quot ; a love story & quot ; , and that is absolutely right.People often accuse Al Pacino of hamming it up and going for an autopilot & quot ; whoa & quot ; performance in many of his films , like his Satan in The Devil 's Advocate . Nevermind the fact that Pacino 's autopilot is more gripping then most actors ' most vivid characterisation , his performance in Donnie Brasco is arguably his best . As Lefty Ruggerro he is both heartbreaking and frightening , ruthless and all too human . He delivers his lines with is patented fiery intensity , but this time he lets you know he 's bluffing , that he ' ca n't back up that big mouth of his . He shines in two particular scenes , one in the hospital and the other is final haunting scene . I will not describe them here . See them for yourself.Donnie Brasco was released in the spring of 1997 , and since the Academy has a pathetically short memory , the film only managed one Oscar nomination which was for Paul Attanasio screen adaptation . When they ignored Pacino 's performance here , that is when they completely lost credibility with me.Is Donnie Brasco one of the best gangster pictures ever made ? Fuggedaboutit ( in the positive sense of the phrase ) . It deserves to sit at the same table and have coffee on the house with the masterpiece of the genre , Goodfellas .	1
What a combo . When this movie was made , Depp was emerging as a truly great actor , alongside the great Al Pacino . Fantastic !	1
In the 1970s , FBI Agent Joe Pistone goes undercover and infiltrates the mob in New York City . Using the name Donnie Brasco , he befriends a 'made ' mafioso Benjamin 'Lefty ' Ruggiero . As time goes by , Pistone begins to identify and care for his mafia friends , especially Lefty . Pistone is married and has children but he is away for weeks or months at a time eventually leading to his wife asking for a divorce . When he stops reporting to the FBI daily as is required , his superiors decide the time has come to pull the plug on the operation . `` Donnie Brasco '' is an extraordinary movie in many ways . The performances are note-perfect . But there 's so much more to it than that . The late 70s period details are impeccably captured , the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic and the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly , agonisingly conveyed . It 's a powerful movie , completely involving , that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone 's predicament , asking what decisions you would make in the same circumstances . An absorbing , well made gangster movie .	1
The Devil 's Own is the kind of taut , well-paced action thriller that a viewer can sit back and enjoy-until it moves you to the edge of your seat . For some reason , Brad Pitt does his best work wirh older alpha males like Harrison Ford added to the mix . No movie can ever explain the historical complexities of an epoch like The Troubles . This movie does , however , do what the movies do at their best-show that there are no simple answers to complex problems.Harrison Ford as New York Irish cop , Tom O ' Meara , welcomes Frankie McGuire ( Brad Pitt ) into his family as a boarder from the old country , not knowing that he is an IRA operative and assassin . Frankie has seen things that children should not see in the struggle between Irish Catholics and Protestants in Belfast . This is vividly displayed in the movie 's opening scene . Frankie is emotionally scarred for life when his father meets a violent end in a place that is normally every child 's final refuge . His cold , handsome eyes reflect the trauma throughout the remainder of the movie.Bringing danger into an innocent happy home is an effective dramatic device that will engage the viewer without fail . And the gradual revelation , and its realization by a credulous Harrison Ford , is developed well . Treat Williams is excellent as an amoral arms dealer . He generates the kind of dislike that any audience member can feel , even if they find the plot confusing . Williams gives the kind of performance here that shows the unfulfilled potential he appeared to have when he first appeared in the movies.Pitt 's death scene is one of the best in quite a while . It 's done with a poignant machismo which returns the audience to the movie 's beginning . There are things that are not fit for a child 's eyes . Exposing him to them creates the product of the devil 's work as reflected in a dying , grown man 's , eyes .	1
This is an excellent film for the purpose for which it was made - entertainment , pure and simple . Too many people wish to argue over who , what , and why & # 34 ; The Troubles & # 34 ; in Northern Ireland have occurred and continue to this day . The explanations are endless and one is left not knowing who or what to believe . Look , 99 % of Hollywood films almost never & # 34 ; get it right & # 34 ; - call it & # 34 ; liberty with license & # 34 ; or whatever you wish - it is what it is . The specific plot itself not withstanding ; nevertheless , the acting is good and so is the script and the production . I enjoyed it & like watching it periodically from time to time . It 's & # 34 ; entertainment & # 34 ; , folks , and nothing else . But in that understanding , it is a pretty good flick and gets & # 34 ; 5 stars & # 34 ; from me !	1
I love all of Harrison Fords movies . Not the jungle ones but the realistic ones . I have most of them	1
The genius of Kenneth Branagh is evident again in this beautiful film . It 's so bright and full of life , bursting with joy and exuberance . The cast is superb . Along with Mr. Branagh , there is the lovely and radiant Emma Thompson , the fabulous Denzel Washington , and Keanu Reeves , who with his marvelous voice and talent portrays the evil Don John wonderfully . The additional cast is superb and the cinematography ( it was filmed in Tuscany ) is glorious . This is one to own and watch repeatedly !	1
There is no way around it , no matter how it is staged Shakespeare will inevitably feel like a stage play . That it is acted by two of Britains foremost stage actors of the time , Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson ( who at this stage were still married ) adds to the feeling . There is some over the top voice projection , but generally this feels light , fun and a pretty glorious rendition of one of Shakespeares frothiest plays.Much ado about nothing really is just what it says . The premise is that the duke returns from the wars with a half-brother whom dislikes him but has reconciled with him simply to create problems . Which he manages to do , embroiling the hapless Hero ( the heroine of the story ! ) and her love . It is all based on falsehood and nothing.Branagh and Thompson play the battling ex-lovers who are reconciled during the course of the movie , but this does n't stay their battling wits and shrewdness . This is one point where their clear diction and stage presence makes a huge difference as each word and inference can be celarly understood.There are wonderful set scenes - the arrival of the duke and his men , and the finish with the dancing through the grounds was gorgeous . The real winner of the movie has to be the house and grounds it is set in - how wonderful ! Who would n't want to live in Italy after seeing this movie - and a nice way to learn some of Shakespeare good fun .	1
It 's worth it to see this movie if only for the happy abandonment and heart-pounding anticipation of the bath scene that kick-starts the action of the story . Picnicking on a Tuscan hillside , the ladies and gentlemen residents of Leonato 's villa espy Prince Don Pedro and his men from afar , galloping at a great pace , returning from the wars . The villa-folk all rise up and run to the house , clambering up the steps to the baths , throwing off their clothes on the way . Meanwhile , Don Pedro and his men jump down from their horses beside a public fountain and , throwing off their clothes , leap into the waters ! There 's a great tumult of music , laughter , and shrieking going on as everybody gets clean and comes up reclothed and fresh to meet the approaching others . Then , the ladies and men and the newly arrived Prince 's company face one another in greeting . The romances begin to manifest , the revels commence , and marriage is assayed by one couple and avoided by another.The theme song that is carefully spelled out at the beginning of the movie will be repeated twice in increasingly fulsome renditions , the final one at the joyous double-wedding dance that circles gloriously about the be-flowered spring world of the villa . The song is chiefly about the inconstancy of men , and advises women to adopt a carefree spirit : `` Sigh no more , ladies , sigh no more , /Men were deceivers ever , /One foot in sea and one on shore , /To one thing constant never : /Then sigh not so , but let them go , /And be you blithe and bonny , /Converting all your sounds of woe/Into Hey nonny , nonny ... . '' Actually , the plot turns upon a case of inconstancy in woman when , at her wedding , Hero is angrily spurned by Claudio who thinks he has seen proof of her wantonness and false virginity . The scene creates a most frightening sense of righteous outrage against a shameless violation of chastity that has seemingly taken place.Beatrice and Benedick profess to detest one another and both eschew the married estate . They keep up a running battle of sparring words , are very similar to Shakespeare 's shrewish Kate and her foil Petruchio . Beatrice , however , seems to be destined for an eventual fair fate when she reports `` A star danced and under that was I born ... . '' Don Pedro and other friends make up a scheme by which they manage to trick Beatrice and Benedick into falling in love with one another . `` What fire is in my ears ? '' asks Beatrice when she overhears the news that Benedick loves her . `` The world must be peopled ! '' declares Benedick when he overhears the news that Beatrice loves him.The actors are excellently expressive and natural . They articulate very clearly so that Shakespeare 's wit and clever language throughout are readily accessible to the viewer . Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh are extra delightful in their roles.There are countless instances of marvelous Shakespearean wit : As in Benedick 's comment about a guitar-accompanied rendition of the `` Nonny , Nonny '' song where he says , `` Now , divine air ! ... . Is it not strange that sheep 's guts should hale souls out of men 's bodies ? `` As when Don Pedro describes Benedick : `` ... .he is all mirth : he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid 's bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him ; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks . `` As when giving a description of Beatrice 's talk Benedick says : `` She speaks poniards and every word stabs . '' Or , `` Oh God , sir . Here 's a dish I love not . I can not endure my Lady Tongue . `` As when Don Pedro scolds Beatrice : `` Come , lady , come ; you have lost the heart of Senor Benedick . '' Beatrice replies , `` Indeed , my lord , he lent it me awhile ; and I gave him double use for it , a double heart for his single one : marry , once before he won it of me of false dice , therefore your grace may well say I have lost it . '' Don Pedro says , `` You have put him down , lady , you have put him down . '' Beatrice replies , `` So I would not he should do me , my lord , lest I should prove the mother of fools . `` Or as when Leonatus speaks of the sort of marriage relationship that bickering Beatrice and Benedick would have : `` Oh Lord , my lord , if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad . `` We see that Beatrice can speak sweet compliments , though . When the Prince asks if she would consider marrying him , she replies , `` No , my lord , unless I might have another for working-days : your grace is too costly to wear everyday . `` This is one of the merriest , wittiest , and downright funniest movies ever in MY book !	1
this is one of my christmas list items and it was a very good item at a good price , thank you . this is the tv show from when i was a kid and they are not so bad as are the ones on today tv . i would rather pay to buy good things for kids to watch than to allow them to see the evil and bad tv shows of today .	1
1993 's `` Much Ado About Nothing '' is Kenneth Branagh 's superb film rendering of Shakespeare 's classic romantic comedy . Veteran Shakespeare actors Branagh , Emma Thompson , and Brian Blessed are joined by veteran Hollywood actors Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton . The movie features the then-young actors Keanu Reeves , Robert Sean Leondard , and Kate Beckinsale.The movie is set at a sun-drenched and sumptious villa in Tuscany , where all have assembled for the pending wedding of Claudio ( Robert Sean Leonard ) and Hero ( Kate Beckinsale ) . To the pass the time before the wedding , Don Pedro ( Denzel Washington ) sets up a romantic trap for the confirmed bachelor Benedick ( Branagh ) and his arch nemesis Beatrice ( Thompson ) , who delight in their verbal tormenting of each other . Don Pedro allows the two to believe that each is intent on wooing the other . This deception is the heart of the movie , as through some delightful dialogue and hilarious scenes , Beatrice and Benedick arrive at a new appreciation of each other.The romantic mood is almost spoiled by Don Juan ( Keanu Reeves ) , who seeks to undermine the relationship of Claudio and Hero by suggesting that Hero has been unfaithful . Reeves looks uncomfortable with the material and his wooden performance as the villian shows it . Fortunately , the local sheriff ( Michael Keaton ) , a bumbling , manic barrage of malapropisms , uncovers Don Juan 's plot and saves the day.This overlooked movie is highly recommended to fans of Shakespeare and Kenneth Branagh 's film adaptations of them .	1
Kenneth Branagh 's version of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is one of the best transfers of Shakespeare to film that I have ever seen . Filmed al fresco , the movie brims with life and good will . The acting is first rate with Branagh and Emma Thompson as Benedick and Beatrice , chewing scenery , Italian goodies and anything else in sight . Richard Briers , Keanu Reeves , Denzell Washington and Robert Sean Leonard are all quite splendid in supporting roles . Branagh 's earth direction dusts off the cobwebs and adds beautiful Italian sunshine to this delightful tale of , well , much ado about nothing . Last , and certainly not least , the musical score by Patrick Doyle is superb . Though the DVD is excellent , I am looking forward to seeing what more wonder the Blu Ray version will offer . A delight in every way .	1
In this romantic comedy that involves two couples - one engaged in a spirited war ( played by Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson ) of wits and battle of sexes that only their friends can help to mend , by tricking them together ( an exquisitely humorous matchmaking ) ; and another devoted couple who has to overcome obstacles created by a scheming evildoer , which comes to a happy ending with a little help from a blundering constable ( played by Michael Keaton ) .The entire play / film is so vibrantly alive and emotionally engaging , that it made me laugh and cry and laugh some more .	1
For an English major , Shakespeare is treated like a Bible , and any adaptation of a play scrutinized to death . This version of Shakespeare 's classic comedy however is very cleverly done and highly entertaining . The scenery and music are incredible . I was hooked from the opening sequence , with the men riding into town in slow motion . The rest of the film is a brilliant mix of comedy , drama , and villainy . I love to watch the war of words between Benedick and Beatrice ( you just know those two are made for each other ! ) and I cringe when Hero is rejected on her wedding day when her honor is questioned . During that scene , I just want to reach right through the television and slap the men for being so silly and mean . The cast is excellent to -- a steady international cast who vary in age and culture . I really am not convinced that Keanu Reeves was the best choice to play the villainous Don John , but the rest of the cast is superb , especially Michael Keaton as the clownish Dogberry . This movie makes me want to laugh and cry everytime I see it . I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a romantic comedy where the romance is not overly sappy and dull .	1
Kenneth and Emma are great . A romantic comedy . A must see .	1
Mounting a production of Shakespeare is no easy task ; neither is watching one . Sometimes the Old English is so hard to decipher it may as well be a different language . And while you are trying to decipher it , you miss hearing the lines that follow . Add to that plots that are sometimes a cat 's cradle of complexity and references and custnms that are sometimes obscure and , quite frankly , more often than not I could use a little help.Enter Kenneth Branagh and his exquisite production of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.Branagh combines word with song , with dance , with the rustling of a leaf , with falls and pools of water in which beautiful young men and women bathe , with the galloping of coursers over the Tuscan countryside , and , of course , with the inspired explication of Shakespeare 's lines by the brilliant performances of the actors so that you drink the play in with your eyes , your ears , your skin , your whole being.I feel certain the Bard would be pleased .	1
This movie is so , as I said , enjoyable ! It 's hilarious - it has both physical and oral comedy . The scenes with Benedick and Beatrice are great.Shakespeare 's play is about two romances . One with a young , innocent , beautiful Hero and a naiive guy ( I forget his name ) . The other is with Beatrice and Benedick , a couple who love to hate each other and do n't realize their true feelings without a little help from some friends . Unfortunately , all is not completely happy . Someone is trying to put a damper on everyone 's fun with lies and false accusations . But do n't worry ! Much Ado About Nothing is n't a tragedy.The music and scenery is beautiful and the who feel is the movie is sprightly and energetic . I think everyone did a good job . Branagh and Thompson obviously were wonderful . Everybody says Michael Keaten ( spelling ? ) and Keanu Reeves were terrible , but I strongly disagree . Perhaps they were a little prejudiced by former viewings of the actors . Keaten was so funny - I am sure Shakespeare was not always refined - and Reeves was evil . They both were fine ! I recommend this movie to Shakespeare lovers ( though it may not be COMPLETELY true to the original text ) and to anyone who wants a good laugh .	1
This is my favorite play by Shakespeare , and partially it is because this movie makes it easier to understand . Great actors , great movie !	1
I got this for my daugter , now 12 , to nurture her love of drama . At this , this fine rendition was an absolute success : she is watching it and memorising the language , drinking it in with the excitment and exuberance of a child . It is wonderful to behold and precisely why I got this film.Branagh 's adaptation is lush and splendidly well arranged . The only flaw , in my opinion , is Keanu Reeves , who simply fails to project any soul into his role . He just is n't of the same caliber as the rest of the cast . Denzel Washington is wonderful as the prince , quite a surprise - I think he is America 's greatest acting talent , yet again.Warmly recomended . It transmits the magic of Shakespeare into the young mind and allows us parents to re-live the brutal ups and downs of young love . I was moved , by the story but also by watching the delight of my daughter in the whole experience .	1
As a film buff and a language lover , I have a distaste for & quot ; filmed plays. & quot ; If I ca n't see the play , I 'd rather read the original text ( in some cases , even when a live theatrical production is available ) . Shakespeare on film works best for me when his language is not merely enlivened by , but translated into , purely cinematic terms ( egs . & quot ; My Private Idaho , & quot ; & quot ; Forbidden Planet , & quot ; & quot ; Ran & quot ; ) .Having said that , I must admit that Branagh 's adaptation of Shakespeare 's theater piece ( in the trade , they call it & quot ; opening up & quot ; the play ) is remarkably successful . As is his custom , he shrewdly infuses the film with abundant images of flesh , pretty scenery , and familiar Hollywood stars . But , most importantly , neither Beatrice nor Benedict gets overshadowed in the colorful mix.Perhaps the most subtle , yet distinctive , twist in this version is the timely & quot ; feminist & quot ; slant Branagh gives to the story of two ambivalent , quarreling lovers by presenting it through Beatrice 's point of view . He begins the film with Beatrice reciting the song lyrics that appear midway through Shakespeare 's play . Then the camera cuts to a close-up of the very words Beatrice is reading , followed by a seque to the arrival of Benedict and company . The song is reprised at the midway point where B and B are tricked into declaring their love for each other , and then saved for Branagh 's spectacular conclusion -- an epithalamion featuring the entire company of actors transformed into a dancing , singing community as seen from a spectacular aerial shot.If you do n't mind filmed plays , this is certainly one to own . In fact , it 's as close to a real & quot ; movie & quot ; as this respectful an approach to Shakespeare 's language is likely get .	1
My first exposure to the genius of Kenneth Branagh was last year in English class . We watched Hamlet and I was so impressed by the ability of Branagh to deliver difficult Shakespeare lines as though they were contemporary English . I did some research and found this romantic comedy . Romantic comedy ? Shakespeare ? All I knew of Shakespeare was tradegy , jealousy , and envy . So you can imagine what a wonderful suprise this film was ! I object only slightly to the questionable casting ; some actors just do n't seem to fit the bill . However , the performances of Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh more than make up for the less-than-perfect ones of others . The two , married at the time , are a delight to watch onscreen , bickering and sparring with witty words that only Shakespeare could dream of.The setting is Messina , Italy , an idyllic paradise seemingly cut off from the world . Indeed , the only whiff of reality we get is the notion of men returning from an unnamed war . This is really the tale of two sets of lovers , Benedick and Beatrice and the younger pair , Claudio and Hero . Benedick and Beatrice fight a merry battle of words that ends , thankfully , just before someone 's heart really gets broken . The other love story is given more gravity but is lackluster compared to the tale of the older pair.If you have ever shied away from Shakespeare due to complexity of language , then , I pray you , watch this film and be astounded by the universality of his themes . Put on subtitles and get lost in the wonderful way the Bard weaves his words , and immerse yourself in the pitch-perfect deliveries of those words in the hands of such veteran actors such as Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson.A young Kate Beckinsale fulfills her duty of looking pretty , but does n't contribute much to the acting talent of the film . Emma Thompson looks ravishing in low-cut white dresses , tanned and wind-swept . The heat of the Italian summer certainly released some passions in these actors , as evidenced on the screen.On the whole , a delighted film for a summer evening , and educational to boot . English teachers , take note .	1
This is a mostly light-hearted romp . Boy meets girl , boy looses girl and finally boy gets girl back . The story is timeless , The whole cast was amazing . Recommend it highly.There is a reason why Master Shakespeare endures - he speaks to everyone .	1
Folks , Shakespeare just does not get any better in films than this one . It is a joy to watch one of the bards best love stories . It is funny-both Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh give great performances . The rest of the cast is superlative also . Denzel Washington stands out . The audience can not but be pulled into this plot and enjoying every second of this movie .	1
I think Bridget Fonda was made for this role . She plays a fashion designer in NYC who needs a female roommate for her apartment . She has just broken up with her fiancee ( a wonderful performance by & # 34 ; Wings & # 34 ; actor Stephen Weber ) , and claims she will never reconcile with him . Enter Jennifer Jason Leigh , who Fonda chooses . Bridget Fonda is entirely cute in this movie . She has just the right haircut , and the greatest outfits featuring short , short skirts that puts this & # 34 ; look & # 34 ; of entirely chic to her every move . No surprise that JJ Leigh wants to copy her , even down to the haircut and color ... Being overly friendly to Fonda 's fiancee ... Butting in with one of her fashion clients ... Leigh goes to any lengths to try to get Fonda to like her ; to need her . When Fonda does reconcile with her fiancee ( who could resist ? ) , JJ tries to make sure she keeps her spot as roommate and questionable best friend .	1
Bridget Fonda is Allie , a woman who must take in a roommate after her boyfriend ( Steven Weber ) betrays her . Enter Heddy ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) , who answers Allie 's ad and moves right in . All is well until Allie 's boyfriend creeps back into the picture , filling Heddy w/ a growing paranoia and dread , which eventually sends her reeling into full psychotic mode . You see , Heddy 's a bit off . She has never gotten over the loss of her identical twin sister , and has spent her entire life drifting from one person to another , looking for someone to be attached to . Poor Allie is the latest target of Heddy 's twisted affections ! Soon , no one is safe , as Heddy digs herself deeper into Allie 's life . Deaths ensue and Allie must face Heddy in a desperate fight for survival . SWF is one of the great horror / thrillers of the late 80s / 90s . It 's right up there w/ FATAL ATTRACTION and THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE . Highly recommended ...	1

Being very wary of TV stars turned movie makers-I was not incredibly optimistic . And I was 100 % wrong ! Will Smith mkaes the transition from prime time to film look effortless . His tv roots only helped his incredible comedic timing and obvious energy in the movie . And what a treat to see Harvard-grad Tommy Lee Jones taking a fun turn ! His stoic , tounge in cheek performance stole the film ! Where the two leads were great-the supporting cast kept right up with them . Most noteable were Rip Torn ( Nadine ) and Vincent D'Onfrio ( Ed Wood , The Player ) as , repectivly , Zed and `` The Bug '' . Rip Torn , a veteran actor of stage and film , brings such fun into the movie as Zed , the head of MIB . He is obviously enjoying the chance to go nuts with his character . And D'Onfrio , who seems to morph for every role he does , is totally off the wall as a bug packed too tighly into an `` E'gar '' suit . His physical comedy in MIB shows us yet another side of him.Probably the best highlights , as a New Yorker myself , were the one-liners.Using the world fair as a cover up for alien landings was brilliant-and Frank the Pug sitting next to a `` statue '' of Riff Raff from `` Rocky Horror Picture Show '' was classic . All in all-a movie lovers ' movie ! !	1
`` Men in Black '' , featuring Will Smith both as lead actor and end credit singer , is a classic comedy . When I first watched it years ago , I laughed at almost every situation . My favourite ? Smith and the other guy are going to meet an expert on intergalactic diplomacy . Everyone assumes it 's the weirdo with the dog . Actually , it 's ... the dog ! Had me fooled , too . Another old favourite is the claim that Sylvester Stallone is an alien . The tall guy from Twin Peaks makes a guest appearence ( he 's been on Star Trek as well ) .Since I was versed in the UFO subculture , `` Men in Black '' struck me as extra funny , since the secret agents do n't exactly behave as MIBs are supposed to . Usually , they behave in the exact opposite way ... And yes , they are more cool ! When I watched the movie last night , I was stuck by two things . One , I was n't laughing so much anymore . Why ? No idea . Maybe I 'm older , maybe I 'm through with the `` funny Black sidekick '' angle , maybe I remember the only twist element in the plot ( `` The Galaxy is in Orion 's belt '' ) . Instead , I found myself analyzing the meaning of the scene where Will tries to fill in a form at MIB headquarters , together with a bunch of marines . Is there some deeper meaning hidden away in that scene ? Or is just me getting Freudian ? Two , despite this , the movie is n't bad , although I might yet draw that conclusion when I 'm Tommy Lee Jones ' age , waking up from a coma after 35 years . Or perhaps I 'm just tired of the UFO subculture ? Although I no longer get laughing tics out of Will 's character in sunglasses , I nevertheless give `` Men in Black '' four stars . If you are 20+ , do n't miss this classic sci fi comic flic . And remember : the Galaxy is in Orion 's belt !	1
Men in Black - one of our favorite all-time Will Smith movies along with the sequel . I sent a few movies to a disabled child and this was one of them . Laughter makes the heart glad - this is a movie that makes you laugh and makes you glad .	1
The humor in this movie keeps me watching again and again ! Great for the entire family ! We like to save it for holidays when all ages are around the house !	1
This movie is everything a DVD was meant to be . When I first saw the pricetag on the limited edition of Men In Black , I was somewhat suprised at the cost . After all , it was a little steep . But having some extra cash , I decided to splurge . When I popped each dvd ( There 's Two ) into my player , I quickly decided it was well worth the money . The sound and picture quality are superb , and the extras are mind boggling . The second disk , which is dedicated solely to extras , freatures several deleted scenes , a unique storyboard to movie comparison , a comprehensive look at the deconstruction of two key scenes in the movie , and so much more . And lets not forget about the free conceptual drawing and supplemental booklet , both included in the box set . As for the first disk , it includes the movie itself , along with a visual commentary by Tommy Lee Jones and director Barry Sonnenfeld . Trust me , if you have the cash , you wont regret adding this movie to your collection .	1
Firstly I 'll agree with David a few reviews up in that they 've stuffed up the concept of what the Men In Black are supposed to be . I too in my days of reading constantly about alien abductions and the like would always find that the MIB were alien life forms , not humans . But all I could do was sit back and say `` That 's Hollywood for you '' and try to enjoy it for what it was.When I saw this in the cinema I did n't enjoy it as much as I could have as I went with someone who was not enthused to see it . Do n't ever do that ! Go alone if you have to . It 's amazing how much that , even in a darkened room , a disenchanted person next to you can alter the atmosphere.That being said , since I 've bought it on DVD and watched it many times since , it 's got to be a favourite . My kids like watching it with me , which is great as it means we can sit down together to watch something and I do n't have to be suffering through some kiddie stuff . Sonnenfeld seems to have found his niche of material with this sci-fi/comedy stuff , and he 's hilarious on the commentary , and very insightful compared to a lot of other commentaries I 've heard.The effects are great - Stan Winston is undoubtedly a master at big screen make up , and the cgi work was n't overdone to the point where it bugged you , like a lot of films are getting to these days . I thought the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was pretty inspired - I 'm a big fan of Tommy and it was good to see him have some fun ( or as much as he can ) for a change . Vincent rocked as the bug , he 's so over the top he 's hilarious ! And so gross ! ! ! LOLLook , it 's Hollywood , so you can never expect too much . Enjoy it for what it is , and it 's a movie where you can laugh , go `` oh man , gross ! '' on occasion , and then have a sing to a Will Smith song at the end .	1
This is a fun and clever film about federal agents who police alien activity ( some government sanctioned ) in the U.S . The story is told more or less tongue-in-cheek so despite some scary alien make-up effects you 're not going to jump out of your seat with this one . Tommy Lee Jones is suave as Agent `` K '' and , while amusing , Will Smith seems to be riffing off his Fresh Prince persona here as Agent `` J '' . It 's obvious from subsequent solid work he 's done that he learned something from the tutelage of a seasoned pro like Jones . Vincent D'Onofrio does an amusing turn as a malevolent alien who inhabits the body of a rustic type . My only complaint is the film does not properly utilize the extremely talented Linda Fiorentino who plays the coroner and had done some solid work in independent film . If this is how she is underused by the mainstream film community she 's better off in the independents .	1
If I were to rate this movie on its own I would give it four stars , mainly because its not a movie that sticks with me , its just fun to watch once in awhile . This limited edition package is really quite nice . When you take the wrapping off you will notice the case is n't like anything else . If anything , its originality is similar to the Fight Club 's packaging . It opens up much like a book , which I think is really cool . As for the contents on the DVD 's themselves , Disc One contains both a fullscreen and widescreen version of the movie , and Disc Two holds all the goodies . There is a feature where you get to watch two scenes being broken down from the first storyboards to the final cut . That is interesting to watch . Another original feature is a scene editing workshop , that lets you & quot ; try & quot ; and be and editor . This feature took a little while to figure out how to use , but once I tried it out , I realized how bad I would be at editing a movie : ) Overall , this is a nice dvd to have , although it is anywhere from $ 5-10 more than the regular version , so it is a bit pricey . My suggestion would be only spend the extra money if you really like this movie .	1
If you like this movie and still do not have it in blu ray , then buy it soon . You 'll love it even more . The picture and sound are excellent.It 's worth spending the extra money . You will not be disappointed.Enjoy !	1
I have really enjoyed the movie and I am glad to own such a great work in my collection . Get it	1
This is about an organization that does n't exist and the way that they deal with the aliens that come to this planet . It is very enjoyable .	1
I hate it when people call something an Instant Classic . However , Men In Black , especially MIB1 , definitely fits the bill . Men In Black is a hoot . Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are such polar opposites one would think this just was n't going to make it . In fact , the fact they were polar opposites is exactly what DID make it.I doubt I 'll have anything to say that any reader will find new and revealing about the movie . The characters are fun , the action is great , the interaction is fantastic.MIB truly is/was an instant class . If you 've never seen it before , do yourself a favor , set some time in reserve to watch it . You 'll thank yourself afterwards . Now would you please pass the popcorn ? Thanks	1
It is not very often that a movie will come along that can be categorized as one of the best movies in so many different movie genres , but this one can.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones act off of each other so well , and have such great comedic timing together I wish they would make more movies together . While the comedy in this movie is not blatant and slapstick , it is good where it is in the story , and just the right amount to be considered a comedy.The action in this movie is great . Mixed with the special effects it creates a movie that from beginning to end is nonstop action and adventure.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones both have made great movies , and this one deserves to be in the list among their best.If you do n't already have this one you should definitly pick it up .	1
A good start to a good series of MIB movies . Good cast and fun banter with an unusual story development .	1
men in black 1 & amp ; 2 both rock . the men in black are a top secret agency that deals with aliens . buy this movie .	1
Men In Black was one of the biggest films of the summer in 1997 . I remember seeing it at the cinema and laughing my head ( substituting for another word ) off . It brought in a lot of money at the box-office and continued to make Will Smith a star.This film is so wildly inventive and funny that you 'll hardly care if it gets to be a tad silly . Director Barry Sonnelfeld is a talented filmmaker and has crafted a fun , highlyentertaining film . So this may be one of my all-time favorite comedies , as well as one of my favorite sci-fi films.Will Smith stars as Agent Jay , who is recruited to be a part of a secret intelligence agency which deals with extra-terrestrials . Tommy Lee Jones is his partner and him and Smith embark on a mission to elimiate a lethal alien . Sure the plot is silly , but the film is hilarious . Smith and Jones haveamazing chemistry and certainly prove to be a great buddy team.This film does n't take itself too seriously which is a good thing , because as I 've stated if you take this film too seriously you are certainly not going to enjoy it.Men In Black is rated PG-13 for Sci-Violence and Language . The action is bloodless , but the language is fair . Overall , a fun film which you 'll have a great time with . The sequel , while not as good as the origianl , is still worth checking out too . Worth owning or at-least seeing .	1
my family and friends really enjoy this movie.i would recamend this movies to others . the other two movies are good to .	1
This movie was as funny as I remember . I love Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones . The DVD arrived quickly and was in great condition . Thank you !	1
Barry Sonnenfeld 's Sci Fi comedy blockbuster starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is one of the most purely entertaining films of the 90s . The premise , taken from the DC comics is simple , yet an excellent choice considering the talent behind the project and the possibility ( now reality ) of a new and exciting franchise.With the superb comic duo of Smith and Jones ( As agents K and J respectively ) and an inventive take on Sci Fi cliches , added with well-played wit and charm , it 's effortless coolness is just right . Jones ' dry persona in the film , combined with Smith 's jibes , is one of the best buddy parings since Newman and Redford . The supporting cast including Rip Torn as head honcho `` Z '' and Linda Florentino are great , and extra kudos for Vincet D'Onfrio as the bug in the `` edgar suit '' .Danny Elfman 's Batman-esche score adds a nice layer of comic adventure . And extra kudos for FX maestro Rick Baker 's award-winning alien creations . All of the seamless combinations of ILM and practical effects are literally out-of-this-world . The audacious concept that aliens are living among us ( disguised as humans ) provides for some humerous moments , including an alien observer screen that shows that MIB-producer Steven Spielberg and Sylvester Stallone ( among others ) are extra-terrestrials . Ok , so it 's somewhat of a re-tread of GHOSTBUSTERS in some caveats , and it dos n't even pretend to have depth . But hey , the universal question pervades : Who cares ? With comedy this good , it 's minor flaws can be ignored . Building on it 's endless comic potential to a satisfying showdown , MIB will no doubt linger long in anyone 's memory , regardless of if you 've been nuetralised.But for cryin ' out loud ! Yet another re-re-release of the MEN IN BLACK DVD . However for all the jaded people who , knowledged by the usual re-release pattern so common in many DVDs ( MATRIX , LORD OF THE RINGS et all ) decided to wait for a better edition of MIB , then here 's the best one to get . With enough extras to satisfy fans , this `` Deluxe Edition '' has it all . A 2 Disc set , the extras include a Commentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld , Rick Baker and the team at ILM , a featurette and trailer from Men In Black 2 a scene editing workshop , Creatures : Concept to Creation , Music video , Storyboard comparisons , Conceptual art gallery , Multi-angle scene deconstructions , Original featurette , Character animation studies , Extended and alternate scenes and trailers ( Phew ! ) . The picture and sound quality are top-notch too . Very impressive stuff , and one of the many reasons you junked your VHS collection yonks ago . And altogether , a 5-star DVD . But then , in a couple of months , a DVD 2 Pack of MIB and MIB 2 might pop up ...	1
A superb cast and outstanding storyline make this a movie I enjoy no matter how many times I watch it . Others have detailed the plot so I 'll skip that.Only the progress of computer graphics makes this so visually believable ( except the size of the alien at the end ) . The deadpan humor also distracts you from dismissing the movie as too fanciful . The movie is pure fun . For those who have to have a deep lesson for a movie to have value , it would be that humans have an arrogance that needs to be put in its place .	1
i love this movie , it 's a real classic , funny and engaging . it 's the type of film that most people would enjoy .	1
I had seen this flick before when I had the VHS version years ago and enjoyed it . So , once I got my DVD collection going , I decided to do what I call 'DVDify ' as many tapes as I could while I had room . I had planned to get the deluxe version of this , but that one went sour . Anyway , I decided to cut my losses , cancel that one and picked this one up . I 'll admit that I had yet to watch this one , but since I had the VHS version , I pretty much know what to expect . I also picked up the sequel to this which I saw a little bit of , but did n't watch the whole thing . I wonder what MIB III will be like since it has come out today in theatres . If you are a fan of will smith ( rapper or actor ) go for this flick	1
The menin black movies are all very enjoyable . WE all love them and would recommend them to anyone who likes sci-fi movies . !	1
I am a huge Tommy Lee Jones buff , so I bought all three MIB 's ( ashamed that I had never seen any of them ) , and I loved them all ! ! They were so fun , and the types of movies where you cant wait to see what happens next . HIGHLY recommended .	1
I remember watching this a little kid a loving it , and I still love it when I watch it today . This movie is great and has Will Smith at his best , I love the funny Will Smith not the serious Will Smith .	1
Filling in some gaps in the collection with some second releases , military and sifi stuff that you can drag out and watch time after time ... . This is a great movie and definitely a keeper ... Great price and great selection on movies ... Fast shipping ... . What can you say ... Amazon and it 's dealers are great.. I live in a rural area and have the world for a shopping mall thanks to them ... . Not often do I applaud technology but I have to here ... .	1
came right on time , in good condition , & very well enjoyed100 % happy with service	1
This is an enjoyable nonsense spoof . It uses all the silliness of UFO , science fiction , and space battles to reveal the secrets of the government service that monitors alien residents ( legal and illegal ) on the planet . Clever and inventive and fun !	1
I was relatively young when I watched MIB the first time and loved it . As an adult I enjoyed it even more . There is a great balance between the serious and funny moments and there was just enough action to keep things interesting . The actors are all experienced and the concept of a group of agents wielding foreign weapons and neutralizers to protect earth is just plain awesome . I think it 's great to be able to watch a funny , family friendly movie about aliens without it having to be an animated movie . MIB 2 may not have had the highest reviews but this original MIB will definitely not disappoint .	1
Funny in some parts . Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor , Will Smith is a good sidekick . Glad it was given a digital copy .	1
The & quot ; Men in Black & quot ; limited edition is one of the best DVDs available . It is loaded with entertaining features and has a very funny commentary with star Tommy Lee Jones.The film itself is very funny and does n't wear out it 's welcome . It 's a good purchase .	1
I have never seen the entire movie . I always catch this movie in the middle of it . But from what I have seen this is one of the worst movies ever . But that is what makes it great . Lame monsters and terrible over dramatic acting team up to make a B movie classic . Now if you think this is an actual `` good '' movie you have some issues . If you appreciate cheese flowing through your tv screen into your living and down the hall out of the window and down the street then this is for you .	1
STARSHIP TROOPERS is both brilliant satire AND highly entertaining , well crafted sci-fi adventure flick . The concept behind it and what you get on the screen is a perfect parody of infamous WWII propaganda films . TROOPERS lightheartedly calls the viewer 's attention to the propensity of propagandized , jingoistic humans for senseless violence without conscience , comicly using a war of humans versus mindless , souless , agressive `` bugs '' to make the point . In the top 20 best sci-fi films ever and a lot of fun .	1
As the reviewer below me says , some will like it for the wrong reasons . I wonder if by this he meant Casper Van Dien half naked and getting whipped ? ? ? Anyway to the more serious stuff , this film is not aimed at those seeking to spend a quiet evening in with an intellectual film . It does however offer 1 1/2 hours of non stop zip gun and fistfighting to sate the hunger of the biggest actionophile . The soldiers are battling bugs who have come from the next galaxy to destroy humankind . These bugs are huge and powerful , and the soldiers are inept and bungling ! This leads to many laughs , some of them sick as people die in stupid ways . The violence is comic book , never is it taken seriously . I would recommend this film to anyone who wants an accompanyment to his/her beer and pizza .	1
Paul Verhoeven 's movies are usually described by me as movies that are easy to hate . While Robocop was great , I did n't enjoy Total Recall all that much and Basic Instinct is basically a movie you should n't like but for some reason it draws you in ( it 's probably because of clothesless Sharon Stone ) . Less said about Showgirls too , the better . He followed that awful movie with this one , which despite not making back it 's budget , it has an odd cult following at times with people loving it 's fascism parodys and its almost endless gore . It 's very campy at times but also it 's got some great action scenes and some very nifty visual effects.It 's many years in the future and people get to enlist in the Army and do service and they get guaranteed citizenship instead of being civilians ( I never caught the difference ) . 3 friends : Johnny , Carl and Carmen join up , each joining different divisions . Johnny 's in the mobile infantry unit , who gets to be up close and personal with huge insects , dodging flying body parts in the process.In the commentary , star Casper Van Dien says the film should 've won over Titanic . True , in looking at Titanic there is a couple of odd looking shots but it was really technically impressive . This film is also wow-inducing too , especially the Zulu inspired shot with probably hundreds of bugs in the same shot . Some of the space shots during battles looking kind of odd but the bugs are very impressive , my favorite being these flying `` hoppers '' .Keep in mind adults : this film is really violent . Heads get knocked off , bodies cut in two , legs , arms , women are n't spared either . It does n't get in the way of the action scenes which are very exciting and visually impressive . One of my favorite bugs is these things that , I do n't know how to describe it but they s**t this plasma out into the air , smacking into ships and causing damage . Too bad they 're not in here much . And since this is Verhoeven you get a big shower scene with lots of T & A . ; The campy parts come in it 's broadcasts where the film will act like a commercial at parts , giving you information on battle strategies and the government 's plan on defeating the bugs . It 's hard not to miss the message , like where soldiers show kids guns and show how to aim . Subtlety is n't exactly Paul 's strong suit but the message comes through . The `` would you like to know more ? '' still gets me chuckling when it comes on.It 's a film that you 'll absolutely love it , or simply wo n't get it . Some will probably just love the action scenes , others think it 's too violent . To me , it 's a great romp that 's finally for adults to enjoy .	1
Starship Troopers could honestly use a few more likeable characters and a more convincing lead , but otherwise , this is as thrilling as movies come , a lightning-paced , hilarious rollercoaster ride of bullets , explosions , gore , raucous humor , and gratuitous nudity . So yes , this is my kind of film , and I relished every minute of it.Troopers is set sometime in the unnamed future , where South American society is apparently dominated by white , blandly attractive teens with Spanish last names , but look and sound distinctly American . The whole things plays like a big satire on fasicism , as these teens graduate from high school and sign up as citizens . Unlucky for them , signing up is almost a guaranteed death warrant , now that the humans have declared war on the Klendathu aliens from a distant star system , giant insectoid creatures that apparently feast on human flesh ( once the soldiers get there , that is ) . Thus , the movie chronicles the adventures of one such platoon , led by Johnny Rico ( Casper Van Dien ) , who 's assisted by pals Dizzy Flores ( Dina Meyer ) and Ace Levy ( Jake Busey ) . Massive chaos ensues.A lot of people I know see this as a stupid movie . An equally large amount of other people I know see this as a brilliant satire . Both can nitpick or examine whatever stupidities or issues they want , I merely see this as a remarkable thrill ride . On a pure popcorn level , Starship Troopers is easily one of the best sci-fi action films of the 90 's ( perhaps behind only Jurassic Park and Star Trek : First Contact ) , so deft as it is at blending action and comedy.Oh , yes , Starship Troopers is a very funny movie , for all the right reasons , too . The first hour is relatively sparse in action ( actually , virtually none at all unless you count that over-the-top football game ) , but it 's more than made up for by the first-rate humor . Definitely the standout segment must be the training camp scenes , which manages to outdo Full Metal Jacket when it comes to sheer brutality and certainly surpasses it in dark , morbid humor.The first half also nicely plays the introduction of our lead characters , some of whom make an impression and a lot of whom do n't . Casper Van Dien , the vapid , lantern-jawed actor that he is , is most certainly not a good actor , and while I could have gone with a more convincing lead , at least he does well during the action sequences . Denise Richards is equally vapid as one-half of his love interest . Faring far better is Dina Meyer , who 's kick- ... turn as Dizzy is a lot of fun . Too bad she exits the film too early . The adult cast is fun , too , especially Clancy Brown as the sadistic , yet caring Drill Sergeant Zim.But Starship Troopers ultimately succeeds because of its action , and what magnificent action it is . The second hour is like strapping yourself into a rollercoaster . We 're treated to harrowing , Zulu-style battle sequences in which our heroes are surrounded at all sides from ferocious , unstoppable enemies . The action is blistering , bloody , and appropriately over-the-top . It 's from Paul Verhoeven , would you expect any different ? Starship Troopers succeeds because it 's great fun , boosted by awesome special effects and a great score from Basil Poledouris . I 'd sure love to see a sequel , but judging from the box office take , such an option may never see the light of day . Still , a must see for action fans .	1
I absolutely love this movie so it is n't all too closely related to the book which i also love the movie is highly enjoyable and has fantastic special effects and awsome bloody and gory action . It is a movie i just ca n't get enough of . As far as science fiction movies go this is the best of the best everything you want . So if you like sci-fi movies starship troopers is a must own !	1
Paul Verhoven and Edward Nuemire 's adaptation of one of Robert A. Heinlein most well known books is totally unfaithful , spits in the face of hardcore science fiction fans , and confuses the themes that Heinlein painfully interwoven into his piece that has been the foundation of Military Science Fiction.And it 's so fun.Pilipino Juan Rico is replace by Aryan poster child Johnnie Rico ( Casper Van Dean ) a handsome chisel body boy who enlists in the Federal services because his well endowed girlfriend becomes a pilot , however she chooses a career in piloting over Johnnie.With nothing to fight for and accidentally killing a fellow squad mate , Rico decides to quit , however an enemy weapon slips past Earth defenses and obliterates his stomping grounds . Now with no home to go home to and nothing else to lose he resends his resignation and goes to war.It 's fun because it makes fun of the patriotic World War II movies between 1945 and 1970 , using the same optimism of kicking it to the enemy and dialog used in the church yard , yet having Verhoven 's trade mark graphic violence and gore . Massive gouts of red and cart wheeling limps , with an icing of total gratuitous nudity that clashes so wrongly . You do n't know whether to be horrified or amused . The handsome and sexy youths of the Terran Federation are the cannon fodder for its war against interstellar insectoid race is only one of the dozens of elements that Nuemire and Verhoven satirize about a war and nationalism in general . This 1997 film came out one year before Steven Spielberg released `` Saving Private Ryan '' that showed what a true nightmare it was to fight in World War Two compare to what was shown in the classic war films of the 50s 60s and 70s . Verhoven took that jingoistic spirit , put it in a science fiction setting , and added the stylized over the top gore seen in early John Woo films . This is not a film to be taken seriously , unless you know something about satire.The two disc special additional is worth every penny . The main feature has a multiple commentary tracks with much of the staring cast as well as the director and screenwriter , revealing funny little tidbits about the production like how Verhoven made everyone read the book that he ignored , while not reading it himself , and a secret that actress Dina Meyer 's discovered to clean up stage blood . Couple with a second disc that has a satisfying documentary with screen tests , special effects test , and conceptual art , you have a good edition to your movie collection	1
To be the grand master of science fiction , very few of Robert Heinlein 's stories have made it to the big screen , and most have not stood up to the quality of Heinlein 's written work.Long awaited by fans , Starship Troopers did not necessarily change the trend of sub-par theatrical adaptations , but nonetheless is a fun and effects laden thrill ride worth a viewing by most fans of science fiction.Starship Troopers focuses on one Juan Rico 's transformation from lackluster schoolkid to citizen and soldier in one of the nastiest wars mankind has ever seen . Rico and other characters make the jump from print to film , but the film adds relationships between them nonexistent in the book and also features many mainly minor characters in larger roles.The chief bad-guys , the arachnid Bugs , are maintained from the novel and adapted with wonderful frightfulness to the screen ; one wonders how these CGI wonders lost to Titanic for visual effects . The idea of capturing a brain bug rather than simply killing mindless drones & warriors also carries over.The film lacks the armored fighting suits that in many ways defined the starship troopers of the novel , a choice made both for financial and for stylistic reasons ( so that the audience could see the faces of the actors rather than just a bunch of big metal suits ) .The themes of social and political responsiblity through citicizenship and service are somewhat overborne in the film and made to appear almost fascist , a fact some Heinlein purists may find offensive.Overall , the film features a lot of good special effects and some great action sequences combined with some poor school-kid antics and at times sub-par acting performances , but fans of Heinlein 's book will definitely want to check out the film and keep their fingers crossed for a good adaptation of The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and other Heinlein works in the future .	1
Director Paul Verhoven ( `` Robocop '' , `` Total Recall '' ) gives us this flick set in the future where high school kids join the military in various roles to become citizens , but sadly they do not know just what lies in wait for them once they join . A few friends who get into the military are thrown into a massive firefight on a distant planet where there are giant bugs are waiting to attack and destroy them.This is a fairly basic premise but its done with quite a silly and goofy flare , from the opening scenes in the high school , to the training camp sequences where some violence occurs thanks to a faulty helmet ( funny moment to me ) , the first attacks on the bug planet and so on . The action sequences are very well done , the bug attacks and effects are very good , sure the acting is pretty bad but the brisk pace and great effects do help keep the movie elevated above most sci-fi flicks.The cast has Casper Van Dien ( `` Sleepy Hollow '' ) , Dina Meyer ( `` Dragonheart '' ) , Denise Richards ( `` Wild Things '' ) , Neil Patrick Harris ( `` Beastly '' ) , Jake Busey ( `` The Frighteners '' ) and Michael Ironside ( `` Total Recall '' ) among others . Van Dien is much better in the action sequences than trying to act smart and speaking of that the most laughable part of the movie was Richards trying to sound smart in her role , which was really laugh inducing to me . But this is one fun , festive movie even if the action is the only great part of it . *** out of 4 stars .	1
The first , and the best , of the series . Honestly ca n't say I 've seen anything beyond the second movie but I 'm just guessing the other sequels did n't match up to this . Full of action and full , good sound to boot . I think you might be glad you added it to your collection .	1
I found the premise interesting . The absurdity of the injuries in training and the limited firepower of an advanced civilization greatly lessens the entertainment . If it was originally meant to spoof Sci-fi movies , it partially succeeded . I can & # 8217 ; t recommend this for children because they would probably have nightmares about the bugs and shocking injuries .	1
This movie is just fun , almost funny at times . Not to be taken seriously .	1
STARSHIP TROOPERS is high on my list of excellent sci-fi films . Man battles Bug ! It is so rare when special effects , story , and sci-fi elements come together -- usually a film relies too much on one and is not balanced by the others.TROOPERS is also a wickedly funny film . Hats off to director Verhoeven for his twisted sense of humor . The killings that happen during the coarse of the film are lightened by this humor . I howled when a dead space-body bounced off a starship 's cockpit window . Verhoeven also drops in hilarious & quot ; Public Service Announcements & quot ; throughout the film -- my favorite features some twisted kids taking pleasure in squashing cockroaches on the pavement . Hilarious.The film does not take itself too seriously . The actors are appropriately heroic and attractive . It 's almost like the SAVED BY THE BELL cast went into the SPACE ACADEMY ! The effects ( LOTS of bugs killing LOTS of troopers ) are very cool . The sound effects are wonderful on the DVD ! All-in-all , STARSHIP TROOPERS is a wild sci-fi ride , done very well , with some humor to push it along .	1
There is so much going on in this film . One viewing will not be enough . This is my absolute favorite science fiction film ever made with Aliens coming in at a close second .	1
Ah here is a classic movie and you wo n't looks at bugs the same way . This takes place centuries in the future ( 23rd century I think ) and earth is all under the Federation and in order to become a citizen ( have a baby , be a teacher , etc ) you have to serve in the military.You have these three High school students that eventually go off and join the military , and all go into separate branches and you get to see what each one does further along in the story , with Johnny Rico as the main person . The story is put together well , and goes together with the intense fighting with the bugs.One of the people that did annoy me was Carmen . I did n't like her decisions she made in the move ( Carmen spoiler : Tells Johnny she wants to go career and broke up with him , but then goes in for a kiss shortly after with the other football guy in the beginning ) . It seemed like she had double standards , but in the end this is a movie about killing bugs under an all controlling Big Brother government.For its time , the graphics are pretty good . I like the shots with the ships in space and the planets , along with the CG bugs . You do notice certain things are pretty outdated , but there are only a few of them so it does n't take you out that much . The gun fire sounds pretty good , and the bugs remind me of dinosaurs in a way , and the sounds portray that well.The commentary was interesting to say the least . The director and writer give their insights to the movie , and their ideas on this movie . While it was interesting to get their insight , it got annoying fast how Paul kept calling USA a fascist nation , and even mentioned they it might be fascist that wanting the movie to speed up to war to see action . Also it seems that Paul always talked over Ed , but Ed is a lower talked so maybe he did n't notice him . Besides those things , the insight to how they did some of the shots and the locations they visited was pretty cool . Especially since this is the only way to find out how they did these things.I recommend picking this movie up since it 's a pretty cool movie , and a definite classic . While the commentary and Carmen was annoying at parts , it does n't take away from the movie itself.~ Written : August , 2010Positives : * Nice space environments* Cool bug killing action* Interesting dystopian world* The `` TV '' segments were cool* Good storyNegatives : * Carmen* Some parts of the commentary was annoying* Not much special features	1
I love this movie . Every Sci-Fi movie does n't have to be serious . This one is fun , sometimes gory , sometimes silly , but always amusing . The characters may not be deep but I enjoy watching them .	1
`` Starship Troopers '' is a bizarre combination of Paul Verhoeven weirdness , WWII propoganda film , cartoonish sci-fi ... and a commentary on the dangers of fascism ! Like `` Robocop '' and `` Total Recall '' Verhoeven successfully creates a world all his own . It could be the same world as `` Robocop '' and `` Total Recall '' where people are constantly the victims of malevolence - be it from man or machine . His usual trademarks are here : over the top violence tempered by nice little details and touches of humour . The actors are lightweights but this fits in with the cartoonish action.The special effects are mostly really good . The musical score is disappointing . `` Starship Troopers '' has a `` low-budget '' , `` B-movie '' feel about it - not entirely to its disadvantage.The DVD commentary with Verhoeven and screenwriter Ed Neumeier is absolutely fascinating and well worth the price of the DVD .	1
This is a VERY sneaky movie . Voerhoven gives us what seems to be a mindless bowl of violent action movie pablum but secretly it is a sharp criticism of militaristic societies . On the surface you see good looking and rather dumb young people happily marching off to war to `` defend '' the earth . Its fun to watch and offers an idealistic view of what the typical empty-headed teenager thinks is life.The true reality for the intellectual-minded is a depiction of a completely fascist society that is far from idyllic . There is little in terms of Orwellian-style oppression of the individual but there is a cradle-to-grave mass propaganda given to all.Millions of humans die as a result of the Federal Network 's military ambitions in the Milky Way Galaxy . As the movie briefly points out ... .Klendathu is on the OTHER SIDE OF THE MILKY WAY ! Hardly a problem unless humans are trying to dominate the entire galaxy . Is that really necessary ? Who cares , as Doogie Howser said `` We 're in it for the species '' . They finally ran into an enemy they ca n't dominate and suddenly humanity is truly threatened due to inherent human arrogance.Politics aside , the movie is obscenely violent ... .the brief nudity is actually nothing compared to the orgasmic camaera views of the impalements , decapitations , and general nastiness the mobile infantry suffers.The biggest crime is that Denise Richards does NOT take off her shirt ... .darn.When I first watched this movie I thought it was stupid beyond belief , but after a few more watchings I realized what the movie really was and can congratulate the director for his subtlety in dealing with the subject of uncontrolled nationalism and imperialistic politics . The Nazi-style uniforms were an excellent touch and underscored how easy it is to fall back into an undemocratic society where the military ends up ruling the roost.Most people wo n't `` get '' the movie , but for the few that do ... .its a quiet little joke that you can secretly laugh about .	1
First of all , I will say that I gave this movie four stars for the movie . But , this review was written on the complaint of the release of the unsuspecting un-playability of the Blu-Ray release.I have a Sony Blu-Ray Player , and this Blu-Ray disc of `` Starship Troopers '' is released by Sony . But , guess what ? This Sony Blu-Ray player will not play this Sony Blu-ray disc . I understand that I 'm suppose to go out a buy a flash drive for my Sony Blu-Ray Player to play this movie.I got ta buy a flash drive just to play one movie ? How stupid is that ? ! The movie does n't even say on the box that I will be required to buy a flash drive if I want to watch this movie . No wonder there were so many of these copies of `` Starship Troopers '' in the used BD bin at the used CD store.First Sony creates a wonderful CD burning program called ATRAC and SonicStage . When I get nearly my whole CD library condensed to just a boxful of 33 hour CDR 's , they discontinue the program so that I will not be able to burn anymore ATRAC CDR 's , or buy another ATRAC CDR player in the future.Now , they release movies on Blu-Ray that you will not be allowed to play unless you buy a flash drive . So , I guess this BD version of `` Starship Troopers '' returns to the used BD rack at the record store with the rest of them.Well that 's it ! I will never buy another Sony product again . They are just too inconsistent with what people will embrace with their product , and will then discontinue it without a damn that people have added their unique technology to their lifestyle , as that of their SonicStage program . And I will not waste money on a flash drive since my DVD of `` Starship Troopers '' looks just fine anyway.Live and learn !	1
This is a review of the first movie of Starship Troopers.Excellent parity of war and governments . Ironically it came out before the Iraq war.Dina Meyer was nice enough to show her top in a coed shower . Just wish Denise Richards did not wait till later movies to show her top .	1
... . and nobody does it better than Paul Verhoeven . This movie eats up Star Wars alive and spits out the pieces , with better special effects , more engaging ( if superficial ) characters , more deliriously paced action , and best of all , not one speck of self-important pseudo philosophy.Set in a typically wholesome fascist society of the future , children learn all throughout school that , first and foremost , military service means citizenship . Johnny Rico and his buddies anxiously plunge headfirst into enlistment , little realizing that what lies ahead are divided pathways , conflicting values , class distinctions , unavoidable war and LOTS of explosions and loud music . Just as they start to question the course they 've taken , their homeland is destroyed , and they are confronted by an inevitable battle with ruthless , screeching , oversized and extrememly unfriendly insectile aliens . The largest of these critters shoots fiery plasma out of its butt , capable of immolating orbiting starships and knocking dormant asteroids into the earth . It 's up to our brave citizens-to-be to stand up to these bastardly bugs on their very planet , cripple them at their source and destroy the threat for good . Are you doing YOUR part ? ? ? Okay , so it 's just a big gooshy noisy cartoon . This film is at least very blatant and honest about its lack of pretense , and still manages a very fulfilling two hours of no holds barred entertainment . You get it all ... .. romance , conflict , explosions , entrails , nudity , sex , Jake Busey 's sneering , Michael Ironside 's glaring , Dina Meyer 's endowments , and seamless digital wizardry , both in space and down in the dirt . This is one of the least boring movies ever made , and even the dumb parts are fun because you know it was done on purpose . A top ten guilty pleasure this viewer can never seem to tire of .	1
This is not a review of the movie but of the Special Edition and all its features . It 's a solid 5 stars of great material packed on two discs . Besides the feature-packed second DVD , the first has two commentary tracks ( stars and the director ) plus a track for the isolated score with commentary by the composer . I would give the movie Star Trooper 3 stars ( well done but I would n't search it out ) but if you love the movie and already have the bare bones DVD , this Special Edition is WAY worth it . Especially if you are into filmmaking and love every nut and bolt it takes to make one . Great release .	1
I had HBO for awhile and that was one of the movies I enjoyed watching . I made up my mind then that I just had to include it in my own personal video library ! !	1
I am a big fan of Julia Roberts she is just so beautiful I wish she would make another movie none the less this one at least gave me a touch of her incredible acting abilities . It 's impossible not to love her	1
julia roberts is not good at all , but diaz is perfect even if her musical skills are not revealed . the story is funny , so buy this movie	1
i loved this movie . ok so im a guy but im also hopeless romantic . my 2 favorite parts of this movie were the end where she danced with george and when they were all singing say a little prayer for u. this was funny , sweet , and kimmys my ideal girl .	1
Own this movie - watch it over & over . Julianne - the star , but not here . Michael - the 2nd star , but not here . Kimmy is cute-as-a-button , drives worse than `` Annie Hall '' , unpretentious , brave , innocent , strangely wise , a class act & not a mean bone in her body . From her 1st meeting w/Julianne & all that followed - I believe it 's just good breeding on her part . George is the most outstanding of all . From Dion 's song at lunch ( way , way past fun for all ) to his rescuing Julianne at the end , he shines . Oh , oh , oh - the opening '60s declaration song is what I came of age on ... p.s . the sisters must be included on the `` best '' supporting actor 's list	1
This movie was excellent . It had comedy , love , and sad moments . And it when totally against what I expected to happen ! ! I am ashamed to say that I wanted the main guy to dump Cameron ! ! All in all , a great film . I do n't own it , but I just might buy it .	1
I just love it ! It 's a romantic comedy which was enjoyable to watch and would watch it again and again ! I love the humor and some singing done in the movie .	1
Modern day & # 34 ; Cinderella & # 34 ; story and played to perfection by Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.This movie is a classic and will always be refreshing to watch from time to time.Dermot Mulrony is so adorable , as the perspective groom , and Rupert ( George ) her best friend was always there to help Julia over the rough spots . There is nothing like a wonderful gay friend.When George showed up at the end of the movie and was talking to her and watching her with his cell phone in his hand and then showed himself and they started dancing , to me , was the sign of a true friend.Cameron Diaz did a great job of playing her role as the new bride to be and so naive ' to the dynamics going on around her and how past relationships can become an issue , under the circumstances.Great entertainment .	1
THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE MOVIE ! I HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT DECIDED TO BUY IT FOR MY KINDLE . IF YOU LIKE A LITE LITTLE LOVE STORY THAN THIS IS YOUR PICTURE !	1
If you 're a fan of romantic comedies , this one should definitely make your list . Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz are both charming . There is n't much soppy romance , just a lot of amusing scenes , mostly featuring Roberts behaving somewhat outlandishly . The movie does n't drag on , and just generally fun . Recommended.Roberts flies to Chicago to try and stop an ex from marrying Cameron Diaz . It 's obviously a poor plan , but it 's funny to watch.If you do n't like romantic comedies , obviously , skip it !	1
This is a great movie . I enjoy watching My Best Friends Wedding every time . I specially love the beginning when the four girls are singing a song and doing a little dance . Sometimes I will rewind that part a few times before watching the movie .	1
If light-hearted romantic comedies are your thing , then this is a must see , because it fits the genre perfectly . Matthew Perry shows very little range , simply playing Chandler without the rest of his friends . It 's not necessarily a knock on his acting prowess , he 's simply delivering what the part called for . Salma is as enticing as ever , and as a result , the chemistry suffers a little . Chandler , all smarm and no charm , does n't seem to deserve a woman as spectacular as Isabel ( Salma ) . The awkward chemistry does n't necessarily take anything away from the film , but it does n't really add any punch , either . Chandler 's parents actually bring a lot to the table in this film , especially his afternoon-alcoholic mother . The incredible final scene , complete with Elvis in the background , is one of the finest scenes ever captured on film . It is a beautiful , hilltop wedding which singlehandedly promotes this film from three to four stars .	1
This is a truly beautiful love story , viewers need to be a little older as it deals with some issues that are not suitable for preteens .	1
I do n't know what is was , possibly the relationship I was in at the time , or it could have been Salma Hayek , but I went through a phase where I watched this movie at least 3 times a week . Pathetic I know , but this movie is that good . Perry and Hayek offer great contrast as couple who has everything against them . If you are a fan of Romantic Comedies or `` Friends '' then you 'll like `` Fools Rush In . ''	1
The movie was the best I ever saw funny cute and sexy good jokes excellent lines to learn from so go buy it watch it with a friends bring all and enjoy Ty The girl friend a must go buy now popcorn drinks	1
I loved this movie when it was released . I have watched it on TV many times since then . I even owned it in VHS . I am so glad I now have it on DVD and will watch it many more times . Mathew Perry and Salma Hayeck have such chemistry .	1
I 've seen it about 20 times now . It does n't get old . The faces , the moves and the lines of Matthew Perry are always fresh . My husband likes Selma , a lot , so it 's a win win for both of us . They are great together.Good stuff !	1
I am not typically a fan of the romantic comedy , but Fools Rush In is one of the few that keeps my interest . The film focuses the trials and tribulations and cultural clash that follows a one-night stand in Vegas that leaves Isabelle Fuentes pregnant . Salma Hayek plays the fiesty Mexican-American photographer who hooks up with Alex Whitman ( played by Matthew Perry ) , an uptight and nerdy WASP architect from New York City who is on a business trip in Nevada.Hayek and Perry both deliver outstanding performances , and despite the fact that this movie is a comedy , it also contains a few sentimental moments as well . The film 's ending is predictable , but the movie itself does raise some important issues regarding inter-ethnic dating and marriage - such as dealing with parents and in-laws , inevitable culture clash , disputes over the child 's religious upbringing , and societal prejudice.Men and women can equally relate to the events in the storyline . This film will resonate with anyone who has ever faced rejection from someone they were truly in love with ; it will likewise resonate with those who have callously brushed aside someone who truly loved them.In the final analysis , this film works so well because Hayek and Perry are such total opposites . Their diametrically opposed personalities drive home the comedy element in this film and keep the laughs rolling .	1
This is a lovely comedy , love story . It also sends a good message , as far as culture differences and the misunderstandings that can come from different cultures . Love the movie .	1
Without creating an elite in the best-understood sense of the word , `` The Remains of the Day '' divides film viewers into two categories -- one is of those who are left indifferent by it , those who miss full-swing action and find the film too long and too boring . The other group ( myself including ) find it delightful and powerful , in a very special understated way.Portraying a relationship of two people who sacrificed their lives to serving their lords , the basic story is enhanced by wonderful performances of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson . These two splendid actors met once again under the direction of James Ivory after starring in the previous Merchant-Ivory production gem `` Howards End '' .The story takes place some years after the war , when the perfect butler from pre-war era , Mr. Stevens ( Hopkins ) , drives the car to visit the Darlington Hall 's former housekeeper Miss Kenton ( Thompson ) . The film 's substantial part takes place in this past , with the end section describing the reunion of the two , whose time for love , sadly , is long past . Yet Stevens embarks on this journey , a little too late for making up for what he missed , when he was such a great , dependable servant to Lord Darlington.Darlington is a character cleverly thought up by the original novel author Kazuo Ishiguro , in that he is an example of a politician going completely in a wrong direction -- the history and the present have plenty of suchlike ones . The film 's main storyline is thus set in ominous undertones of pending World War II.Surging , restless score by Richard Robbins ( not very good for listening on its own , without viewing ) and beautiful cinematography help make the film what it is , a stunning work of art , but two main stars steal the show . You could say sometimes there is a lack of expression on the face of Stevens whatsoever and still it 's a great acting . He just loses his temper once -- but Miss Kenton is not there to see it anymore . For that matter , Thompson 's acting is , as always , equally superb -- her eyes and face speak volumes without words.Indeed , there is a lot of going on for a careful observer to see and digest in his/her mind while viewing this film . Subtly beautiful and ultimately quite sad , it leaves you with questioning your own priorities in life.If you have n't seen `` The Remains of the Day '' yet and love films set in England ( `` Sense and Sensibility '' , `` Gosford Park '' , `` Howards End '' ) , give yourself a treat a see it .	1
I love anything that Anthony Hopkins does & this is no exception . British films & television programs are the best . I had already seen this film numerous times before I purchased it & it 's just as good as the first time I watched it . Excellent film ! Kind of an unrequited love story . The day to day workings of a British upper class family & their staff . This takes place during Hitler 's regime & the politics of that era is prevelant throughout the film . The characters are developed extremely well . This is a definite keeper !	1
Quaintness is a British style and anyone born and bred in that country knows everything about service when it is service to a lord . The servants of these lords are a species of servants quite different from anything we can imagine and Anthony Hopkins is making the depicting and rendering of this profession one of the most perfect and intriguing pieces of cinema about the humanity of these servants . It is true English literature is absolutely full of models , including Shakespeare though this latter one preferred his nurses and maids insolent and witty . Are they still humans , or are they robots . We will actually never know . They are able to behave and react along the same line no matter what happens . His old father trips and hurts himself , his old father dies during his service , fascists from Germany are roaming around and trying to manipulate the Prime Minister and the Lord his highness and lordship , an American delegate slaps them all across the face by calling them amateurs , his housekeeper leaves him to marry and ends up crying all her heart out , two Jewish refugees are fired because they are Jewish , anything , really anything may happen and nothing will change the course of their service , of their life of service . They do n't hear , they do n't see , they do n't think , they do n't know anything , anyone , anywhere and at any time . Never will one single word stand out in the discourse of these servants , not one button be untied , not one shoe be unpolished , one hair stand upright instead of being curbed down . They are automatons that are just intelligent enough to pass the wine around and not pour mustard in the glasses . That world has vanished of course , mostly , and such caricatures of humanity have been mostly erased from our memory , especially since television has produced innumerable funny comedies on such valets in today 's world . So why do they do it ? To live well without having to think of any problem or difficulty ? Anything and everything is taken care of ? They are wing props that will never come on stage and shine but they like obscurity , shadow , shade , invisibility ? Apart from that quaint vision of a quaint world that has disappeared , thanks God in any religion imaginable , what 's left ? People who can look on their lives and consider that they have achieved nothing , they have reached no real target , they have been no one , no one of any importance , they have shown no self pride and no self esteem because the self is just beyond that world for servants . Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson play their parts with so much truth and dedication that we even believe after all it might have been a good thing . They would have accepted to be thrown alive into the incinerators in Auschwitz or Buchenwald and they may even have said `` Thank you , Sir , and I am glad I can be of service ! '' It is all the more poignant and pathetic because the Lord and master was a pro-nazi activist and tried to sell England to Berlin , though he only managed to sell Czechoslovakia in Munich . Any honest British citizen should have resigned when asked to dismiss two Jewish Girls because they were Jewish and actually found a way to tell the public and warn them about the villainy that was being prepared : more than fifty million dead in the world . They are the leftovers of a banquet they have not even tasted.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne , University Paris 8 Saint Denis , University Paris 12 Cr & eacute ; teil , CEGID	1
An extraordinary film , The Remains of the Day , brings to the screen the story of an English butler , during the interwar period ( and after ) , whose loyalty , devotion and integrity surpass all known human limitations.It is a film about human relations , love , hope and inner strength , but most importantly about honor , duty , and loyalty ; qualities that sadly seem to have vanished from every day life.Anthony Hopkins , Emma Thompson , Christopher Reeves , and the rest of the cast , have truly outdone themselves with their performances , which are outstanding to say the least ! All the actors , without exceptions , give it their 100 % and it really shows ( the chemistry is AMAZING ) ! Very well written and very well presented , it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again ! The setting , the plot , the dialogues and the music are all wonderful ! In short , The Remains of the Day is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection !	1
Reunited from their celebrated stint in `` Howards End '' , producers Ismal Merchant and James Ivory have once again teamed Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins for this exceptional follow up . As a reviewer of both films , I find myself torn to comment on which is the better movie . Quite simply , each is brilliant . In `` The Remains of the Day '' Hopkins is Mr. Stevens , a butler at Darlington Hall who is so deeply steeped in the traditions of the Edwardian class that he can not bring himself to express his love for the head housekeeper , Miss Kenton ( Emma Thompson ) . James Fox is cast is Lord Darlington , an English gentleman who unfortunately becomes one of the Nazi 's pawns during World War II . Also in the cast are Hugh Grant and Christopher Reeves.Columbia 's special edition is an above average attempt for the studio . But the transfer lacks the vibrancy of its predicessor . Colors are accurate . Details can be sharp . Sometimes the picture is excessively soft or slightly smeared , the result of noise reduction equipment employed during the film 's remastering to DVD . Contrast levels can appear slightly low at times . There is even some minor aliasing and pixelization that creeps in . I should like to point out that , while none of these imperfections is glaringly prominent throughout the movie , they are all present nevertheless . The sound has been nicely remixed to 5.1 . Extras include a documentary and audio commentary as well as the original featurette produced at the time the film was being made . All of these are substandard in terms of image quality , suffering from compression related artifacts . It 's beyond me why more studios do n't simply put the movie on one side of the disc and the special features on the other instead of cramming everything together and risking such digital anomolies . Overall , a worthwhile disc to add to your private collections . Just not an outstanding example of all that DVD technology is capable of delivering .	1
Yes , there remained a day to spend together after 20 years for neither of Miss Kenton nor Mr. Stevens could tell the love they felt for each other openly those many years ago . They could not tell it then and it was already late to do so when they met the one last time . One gets the feeling that they would have had a happier life if they have done so when what prevented them at the time was a deep love for his work on Mr Steven 's behalf and maybe a womanly pride on Miss Kenton 's behalf . Maybe also her love for her work . I felt she was maybe getting revenge while marrying another man in front of the eyes of the man she loves , or urging Mr. Stevens to open his feelings . She might have felt an urge to get married as well . I think this is a story of how people can sacrifice their love for other things they find pride in . Regardless of this is right or wrong , I wish I could have seen them happier by the end of the movie ...	1
REMAINS OF THE DAY is a wonderful film that is not quite as good as the fabulous novel it is taken from . Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins are perfect in the leads and it was nice to see a healthy Christopher Reeves as well as a young Hugh Grant cast in it . The film is quite true to the book with a few changes - some of which were necessary in bringing the novel to the screen and some that seem quite pointless . The film is beautifully photographed with lovely views of England 's countryside and the marvelous furnishings of great estates . And the acting , of course , if first rate .	1
I have read the Booker prize winning book by Ishiguro and it blew me away . It is a special book that shows the life of a person who sacrifices everything for his master . I was sure that the movie will not live upto my expectations as a lot of it is in the mind of Steven , the butler . However , the movie did do a impressive job of it . It is one of the best directed by James Ivory and has a great cast , Anthony Hopkins , Emma Thompson , James Fox , Chistopher Reeve and Hugh Grant , all of whom give outstanding performances . This movie was put together beautifully and shows the life of a person , Lord Darlington who is sympathetic to the Germans after WW1 for their bad treatment . It shows how naive he is in understanding the change happening in Europe and Germany , especially . It also shows how a number of people subscribe to his view and class distinctions then . The part where they discredit democracy by showing how little the butler knows of the world and yet he decides who should govern the country is nasty , but well done . Christopher Reeve does a good job of showing how they are amateur in their thinking and how politics must be left to professionals . James Fox does a good job as the Lord Darlington , who is simple minded , does mistakes and realizes later . Hugh Grant comes in an unusual role as his grandson and pointing out the problems in Germany . Though there is not much humor in the movie , the few pieces are well done.Anthony Hopkins plays the role of the butler very well and deserves praise for being the person totally dedicated to his job and employer . This leads to his coldness and distant behavior . His first meeting with Emma Thompson , as Miss Kenton , is a special occasion and it shows how he is in love with her , but unable to show it for multiple reasons . Their relationship is very touching , both during the good and bad parts . It eventually leads them to separation . When she tries to reason with him on a number of occasions , he accepts her rationale at times and not at others . He is single minded in his dedication to his job , however distasteful it is , though she is more pragmatic and works with conscience . Between the two , they carry the movie through . It is not an easy story to be cast into a movie , but the two do an impressive job and must be congratulated for that . This is a movie of love that is not consummated and is wonderfully portrayed . It is one of the best Merchant-Ivory movies and should not be missed for the thoughtful direction , great acting and good screenplay . It is well directed with time change between 1930s and 1960s . The DVD transfer is also very good . The only complaint is that in the end when one can see the torture in the face of Stevens , it does not fully show the thoughts going on in him when he sees that he is losing Miss Kenton .	1
The richnesss and care taken in this period piece is not to be missed . The acting is great and nothing is left to chance in writing .	1
I was unsure how a film could convey that internal machinations of the butler 's mind as portrayed in the novel . While not exactly the same experience , this movie does an admirable job . The acting is magnificent . The story is nuanced and touching without being sentimental .	1
Because of my slight obsession with Downton Abbey , I wanted to revisit this movie , which I first saw the year it originally came out ( 1993 ) . I had never read the book , so I read that first , and then saw the movie . The book is beautifully written , and its emotional impact takes it time to hit you because it appears devoid of it for a long time.Because of his iconic portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs , it is sometimes hard to remember that Anthony Hopkins is a brilliant actor in all sorts of roles . In many ways , this performance is even better : understated to such an extreme that a slight turn of the mouth conveys much about the character.And Emma Thompson is pitch perfect in her role as well . Her exasperation and deep feelings give the counterweight to the performance of Hopkins.This is not a tear jerker in the classic sense , and yet both twenty years ago when it first came out and last week when I watched it again , I found myself with tears rolling down my face . It sneaks up on you , and it is worth it .	1
A beautiful and wonderfully well acted movie . Welcome appearances by Christopher Reeve and Hugh Grant and of course excellent work by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson . Be warned , it is a romantic story but not a fairy tale . Four and a half stars .	1
Very good story and very good interpretation by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson . I also liked the photography and edition !	1
It 's clear that this film is a departure from so many foreign film with children . The film draws on the innocence of Ludovic , a 7-year old boy , living in France , who believes he was meant to be a girl . After confusion whether he is a boy or a girl , he learns that girls have XX chromosome ; he fantasizes that God made a mistake sending chromosomes into the chimney at his birth . He believes one X chromosome landed into the trash.Ludovic thinks nothing of correcting the problem , not knowing what life holds for those family members affected by transgenderism . He does n't hide his feelings for another young boy , his friend Jerome . It is Ludovic 's family , and family 's colleagues who are very uncomfortable with the problem when it becomes more serious enhanced by tension , fear , blame and guilt.This is director Alain Berliner ' debut film , and he touches the subject carefully , not to confuse homosexuality with transgenderism . Ludovic clearly believes he was meant to be a girl and does n't confuse that with anything else ; he is simply a child believing there is a mistake and he will have it corrected . Meanwhile , he escapes into the fantasy world of feminism and pink . The film , considered a comedy , does n't quite live up to the comedic thread . It is tender , poignant , and sad . The child played by Georges DeFresne is said to have been an eleven year old playing a seven year old ; he performs remarkably as his expressive eyes reveal innocence , confusion , happiness and sadness.The 1997 film received the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film . There is nothing here that would be offensive to young children . It is something for all . ... .Rizzo	1
`` Ma Vie En Rose '' Is the story of a little boy named `` Ludovic '' who desperately wants to be a girl.While most boys his age want to be cowboys or Soldiers Ludovic dreams of living in a fantasy world where dolls are larger than life and he is a princess . He is not free to do the things that feel natural for him to do , Things that other people say are not allowed or socially accepted.So he creates an imaginary friend name Pam who is a Barbie like doll that plays with him and takes him on journeys far away from the reality of his confused and troubled life.It 's a heart breaking story of how people ostracize and condemn things and people they do n't understand.In Ludovic '' s heart he is a girl and does n't understand why people ridicule and torment him `` cant they see it ? '' he must think . He rebels against all the attempts to make him stop acting out his fantasies and wearing what he feels is proper and comfortable attire for him which make his neighbors and acquaintances perceive him as sick , disturbed and in need of help when in reality they are the ones that need the help so they can stop being judgmental and ignorant.While the other people around Ludovic are like circles and can roll freely he is a square that does not roll smoothly and will endure all the bumps and have a rocky ride ahead of him due to the fact he is shaped differently.This movie is a must for anyone who might think their child is exhibiting signs of transgenderism during their early years and for people who cant think out of the box so they can put themselves in Ludovic 's tiny yet heavy shoes or for anyone who wants to see a beautiful story .	1
This is a really amazing film about a seven-year-old boy named Ludovic ( Georges Du Fresne ) living in France who is convinced that he is supposed to be a girl . He keeps telling his family that he will turn into a girl soon , and then he 'll be able to marry the boy next door . He also keeps dressing up in girl 's clothing and showing up in this attire at neighborhood functions.His family is at first amused but their reactions quickly change as they realize that Ludo is very , very serious about this . Their situation is complicated by the fact that the family has just moved into a new suburban neighborhood where they just happen to live down the street from the father 's new boss ( who got the house for them ) . And `` the boy next door '' is the boss ' son . One by one , the family members ( except for Ludo 's young-at-heart grandmother ) turn against him , and the family dynamic begins to fray at the edges . Last to capitulate is Ludo 's mother Hanna ( Mich & egrave ; le Laroque in a FANTASTIC performance ) , who tries her best to keep loving Ludo throughout the ordeals he creates for them all simply by wanting to be who he thinks he is supposed to be.The movie is very thought-provoking and it has an ethereal quality to it created in part by the lush colors ( lots of bright shades of pink and green are found throughout ) and the frequent forays into Ludo 's fertile imagination . His inspiration comes from his Pam and Ben dolls ( French version of Barbie & Ken , though I 'm not sure whether they are real French toys or were just made up for the movie . ) and he often pretends to be visiting Pam in her dream-like TV world , because that 's the only place he feels 100 % safe and accepted.Overall this movie is well worth watching . It will definitely produce some moments of discomfort now and then because of its frankness and because Ludo 's timing is so bad at times . The writing and acting do n't shy away from portraying the struggle his family has to undergo in order to accept him . They never stop loving him -- it 's just a question of acceptance . The film plays likeEdward Scissorhands ( Widescreen Anniversary Edition ) meetsHedwig and the Angry Inch ( New Line Platinum Series ) ( minus the songs ) and it deals in an honest and often bracing way with the social stigma attached to gender identity . The DVD transfer is lush and spectacular , and makes this film an excellent buy in spite of the dearth of extras.Oh and one note to keep in mind before you watch this : The subtitles have been cleaned up for some reason . `` Tappette '' does n't mean `` bent boy '' -- it means f*ggot .	1
Ludovic is a happy seven year old boy . He likes to dress in skirts , play with dolls like the girls at his age , and he dreams of marrying the neighbor 's son when he gets old . These are things that the neighbors see as evil and it does not help that his father is working for the man across the street . The neighbor 's negative feelings , phobia , and discomfort of Ludovic 's behavior causes a series of events that is the beginning for a long ritual of freezing the family out of the neighborhood . This also triggers a gender identity crisis within Ludovic . My Life in Pink is a wonderful and painful film where the audience can experience Ludovic 's shame of self existence , however , the film can help build a deeper understanding for others .	1
This movie should be used in schools to teach about tolerance . I do n't understand why it is R-Rated . As far as I know , it could have been made by Disney.The plot : Ludovic is a confused seven year old boy : he finds out he fancies a boy in his class and likes to dress up as a girl . Because he is so innocent , he casually tells his parents he would like to marry Jerome later . When told that boys can only marry girls , he replies `` I know that ! `` , because he really perceives himself as a girl . What he comes across is incomprehension , frustration and anger from everyone in his family , as well as school mates and neighbors ... If you are looking for a movie that will make you both laugh and cry , watch it today , you wo n't regret it !	1
To give an idea of what effect this film had on me , I was willing to break my long-standing rule of never sitting through a subtitled film . ( If I wanted to read , after all , I would have bought a book ) . But `` Ma Vie En Rose '' was the rare exception.One is first struck by how different it is from films with a similar theme ( such as `` Priscilla '' and `` To Wong Foo ... . '' ) The aforementioned films portray transsexuals and transvestites as occupying the fringe of society , and the lunatic fringe at that . Ludo is a sweet , carefree , innocent child whose conviction that he is a girl is every bit as innocent . Ludo could be your neighbor 's child -- or yours.Paradoxically , the film shows how far we 've come ( can you imagine a film like this being made ten years earlier ? ) and how far we have yet to go . Ludo gets the expected hassling from schoolmates , but their reaction is nothing compared to that of the adults in the neighborhood -- a clear indication of where the children get their prejudices in the first place . One gets the impression Ludo 's parents ( the mother , anyway -- the father seems too weak and ineffectual to have an opinion ) really want his happiness and will accept him whatever he turns out to be -- whether gay or transsexual . When the mother , her patience exhausted , finally cuts Ludo 's long hair , it is done not out of contempt for Ludo but the weariness that the furor around him has caused.The film 's highlights have to be the extended fantasy sequences taking place in Ludo 's mind , a world of Barbie-like dolls , in a cosmos where X chromosomes tossed by a careless Creator end up in the trash . It does tend to fall back on stereotypes ( the strong mother/weak father myth ) but is a greater plea for understanding than a hundred books on the subject .	1
Wo n't try to compete with other folks saying good things about this wonderful film , but wanted to confirm that the DVD received from Amazon.com in January 2004 is a superb transfer with full screen on one side and gorgeous Anamorphic 16:9 widescreen on the other . Watching films on a widescreen television is the coolest ! Be aware it 's necessary to tell your DVD player ( in the set-up menu ) to format for a 16:9 screen . This automatically outputs any anamorphic DVD as full-screen ( without black bars top and bottom ) . This will look tall & amp ; skinny on an old-fashioned 4:3 monitor , but when stretched to fill a wide 16:9 screen it looks glorious !	1
This was a great film but it let itself down with the ending . In truth , Hollywood wrote this ending so that the good old USA trumiphs over evil again ( and the box office is n't harmed again ) . But up until that point , this was up their with the best of them as Harrison finds himself aboard a hijacked Air Force One . The vice president ( Glenn Close ) finds herself eventually almost forced to rule that the president is making decisions not as a leader but as a family man and that as a result of this she MUST take charge . The film looks as though it may take this view but then about turns and declares that the Vice President makes a brillant decision by not only giving in to the terrorists who then reveal that they would not let the president go anyway and will use him as a political tool . Now at the end of the film the President escapes and the film in a few scenes shows her as having solved this crisis - presumably she knew that the president would become Rambo and save the day . Good movie until this point after that typical American Schmaltz ( but still great fun )	1
After making a speech to the world about a no-tolerence policy againgst terrorism , the president 's plane is hijacked by terrorists . This is an amazing film . The plot is superb , and the action is great . Harrison Ford is an astounding actor , and plays a president/father with super accuracy . The stunts in this movie are great , including a scene with a refueling tanker , and a scene where the president must ride a tether to get out of the plane .	1
This Movie is the best movie I 've ever seen . First of all , I find it very cool cause of all the advanced technology involved . Then there is all the action that does n't give you a moments rest , with up 's and down 's that make your stomach turn with each new scene , and leaves you with the thought of & quot ; what 's gona happen next & quot ; or & quot ; how will he get out of this & quot ; ? And the actors , ah , there out of this world . Harrison Ford ( the President ) I do n't have to tell you is good , he 's my favorite actor . Gary Oldman ( head highjacker ) is so intense , so real , he has his own unique dry sense of humor that spices it all up . What makes this movie so entertaining , and thrilling , is the fact that you ca n't take your eyes off till the end , trust me .	1
I could n't wait until this came out in Blu-Ray . A real upgrade that is well worth the purchase . Color and lossless sound are excellent , considering the age of the movie . A 12 year old movie ca n't be upgraded to compare with the movies of today , but a great improvement for this movie.If you love this action movie and have lossless audio , owning this is a must .	1
This is a good movie to keep on your & # 34 ; watch again & # 34 ; list . Each time I watch it my attention is grabbed .	1
... to be an American ! ( No matter where you 're from . ) Terrorists hijack Air Force One . Harrison Ford is President . Take it from there.A well-paced thriller , with characters - good and bad - having more than one dimension . Moments of ruthless cruelty - and moments of extraordinary courage and valor .	1
Harrison Ford does a great job in this film . He 's so convincing in both emotion and action wise as in his great old movie Indiana Jones ! Although we have seen so many films about airplane accidents and hijacking but this one is a Master Piece of all.the suspense is very original and the action is very entertaining ... of course you see that US politics plays a major role in HollyWood !	1
Harrison Ford plays the President of the United States and does a great job at it . I have watched this movie too many times to count . This is one of those movies that have you cheering for the President . It 's about time someone made a movie where the President stands up for himself instead of someone always trying to save him . Gary Oldman does a fantastic job as the terrorist . He really makes you believe that his cause is the right cause . Some scenes did remind me of Die Hard , but if you liked Die Hard you will love this movie . My wife was watching the movie with me and kept digging her hand into my arm ! She really gets into the movie more than I . Overall , the DVD sound and picture is excellent . This is definitely a buy not a rental !	1
This is a great film , and it will be even better on Blu-Ray . I am excited that this is finally being released on Blu-Ray in the US.Harrison Ford turns in a great role as the President.The TrueHD Audio should sound awesome - especially the action scenes.I highly recommend.EDIT : I have now seen this movie and it is AWESOME ! The video and audio are superb .	1
Waiting for Indiana Jones IV to come to pass , it is always time to reflect on the sad state of Harrison Ford 's career , and as we flip through the years it seems to me he has n't had a bona fide hit since 1997 . ( 2000 's WHAT LIES BENEATH probably made money , but few credit Ford 's presence in that thriller for its success ; possibly it was a hit due to the well-tuned script and the expert direction by Robert Zemeckis . In any case Michelle Pfeiffer -- another star of the 1990s whose career has gone sadly awry -- deserves half the credit as well . ) Otherwise it 's like a list of one disaster after another . K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER ? Dead in the water . HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE ? Not a bad show but the public stayed away in droves . RANDOM HEARTS ? When you look up `` catastrophe '' in the dictionary you get a still from this movie . SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS ? Awful . WATER TO WINE ( 2004 ) ? Even his fans do n't know what it is ! I 'm not sure FIREWALL will break the curse either , it sounds like a re-tread of an earlier Ford flop called FRANTIC.So when we look back and try to find the last good patch of Harrison Ford 's once invincible streak , we come up with a thump against this indisputable box office sensation , which rules the theaters world wide for a brief spell in 97 . The critics thought it piffle , but it answered a need in the US public , maybe to see a strong president defying the Russians one last time . Reactionary ? No two moviegoers will read its plot the same way , but there are certainly cimilarities to the FOX TV hit `` 24 , '' which it foreshadowed in so many ways , even down to the canny use of amiably sinister Xander Berkeley , the husband in SAFE . And of course the death defying traumas that occur to Air Force One in both programs.Most of all , I think people long for a president who 's more like James Marshall here , than the one we had in 1997 or the one we have now . He 's a father figure , he 's still vigorous and sexy , he 's got a good sense of humor , knows his way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close.AIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford , whose previous films had been major disappointments -- the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL 'S OWN with Brad Pitt . I think at that minute we really needed Harrison Ford to start thinking about how to sustain a career . Instead he just must have said Ah Screw It and switched the remote to a then-new TV show called ALLY McBEAL . The rest is film history .	1
Is it possible for Harrison Ford to make a bad movie ? Maybe , but & quot ; Air Force One & quot ; ai n't it . This is a riveting movie about a terrorist group hijacking the world 's most well-known airplane , while the President ( played by Ford ) must single-handedly defeat them . From Ford 's performance to the special effects to the music , this is a wonderful film.Wolfgang Petersen , the maker of the terrifically gripping & quot ; Das Boat & quot ; , directs here and lends the film a terrific sense of claustrophobia . The cat-and-mouse game Ford plays with the terrorists will leave the audience on the edge of their seat . Ford is the idealization of what every American wants his Chief Executive to be- tough , a man of action , resourceful . The same way Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart were film icons of the 1940s and 50s , Ford will come to be remembered as one of the great actors of the 80s and 90s . His casting could not have been better.Jerry Goldsmith 's music here is good , but not great ( his score for & quot ; U.S. Marshals & quot ; was better ) . I was n't overly thrilled with Gary Oldman 's performance as the leader of the Russian terrorists ( a little over-the-top at times ) and I wonder if the Russian nationalist plot has n't been overdone by Hollywood . I also did n't buy the climactic final rescue of the President from the crashing plane . The rest of the cast is quite good however , and the action is exciting.On the balance , a pretty darn good movie .	1
Ne , This movie was AWESOME ! ! ! ! Man , heaven forgive me for not putting it on my & quot ; Best Movies on Earth & quot ; Wish list . Grr ! ! ! Oh well . Maybe I 'll make a another list . Anyway , the action here , is spectacular . Acting ? ! For the love of God , HARRISON FORD 'S IN IT ! ! ! Of coruse it was good ! This is movie really is awesome ! DVD quality ? Same as any other DVD . But if you have a DVD player in your home , I advise you to take the biggest speakers you can find and connect it to the TV that 's connected to the DVD .You 'd be be amused for ages . Okay . I 'm done . Baibai .	1
Harrison Ford portrays the President of the US . VERY GOOD movie ! I really enjoyed it . It keeps you on the edge of your seat & is very action packed ! 5 stars !	1
Loved the movie in the theater and love watching it again . Who does n't want to see their president fighting back against the bad guys ! ? Just wish there was less profanity .	1
My husband likes this movie very much . It is one of his favorites . We pretty much like anything Harrison Ford . In our opinion , he is a great talent . Air Force One has a very creative story line with a lot of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat . We are replacing an old VHS tape with this DVD . This is a very good movie .	1
I saw this film for the first time in theaters with my aunt and a friend , at the time , bad move ! ( long story ) I 'm much more analytical now with movies , most of the time . Harrison Ford does a very good president who has a no-nonsense approach to terrorism , led by a cold and merciless terrorist Gary Oldman . The plot is fairly easy to follow , and composer Jerry Goldsmith , who I 'd swear Saw composer Charlie Clouser took some tips from ) once again has an excellent musical score . Even though I do enjoy this film , I do have a couple issues with it : first , I know Gary Oldman is the primary villian in this film , and the script makes him very easy to hate , more with actions and facial expressions . However , he is n't the only character I could n't stand , Dean Stockwell as the Defense Secretary , how pathetic , in this case . Aside from Harrison Ford , Glenn Close , the wife played by Wendy Crewson from Good Son and daughter , some characters do n't last long enough to even care about . And in movies like this , you have to know the villian has back-up , unfortunately , that cliche has gotten very old for me , along with the `` kill the witness formula '' . All that aside , this also set the stage for two other similiar movies recently released in theaters , both that I watched and overall liked-Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down ) This film however , seemed like a blueprint for those films , even though , obviously , the new ones , seemed a lot more intense . In those films , however , at least with White House Down , the media was as bad as the terrorists ! When it comes to news reporters and tabloid reporters , whatever celebrities want to dish out at them , including violence , dare I say it ? Bravo ! Esp . when they are so relentless and do n't care who they hurt to get their story , remember Princess Dianna ? Do n't even get me started !	1
At a conference in Moscow President Marshall vows that he will never negotiate with terrorists . This is tested immediately up his arrival at Air Force One . Gary Oldman does a masterful job playing the terrorist leader . Him and his co-horts take over the most secure airplane in the world . They make it seem realistic and fairly believable . Oldman has always been one of my favorite villian actors . Unfortunately some actors are typically typcast . One villan show and you 're set for life . Oldman sets this mold in this movie . He 's entirely believable as the Russian nationalist willing to do anything for his cause.Harrison Ford , one of the quintessential actors of our time , was the perfect match as the battling President . When called upon , he fights back with the best of them . When push came to shove he shoved back real real hard . You can really believe him as the President of the U.S.A ready to risk it all to save his family.Glenn Close is equally riviting as the female V.P . `` You 're Commander in Chief has given you a direct order . DO IT ! ! '' Some of the reviewers criticize the movie for her role . She 's the Vice President . When the President has a gun to his head she is SUPPOSED to take charge . She IS SUPPOSED to something . To do anything else would be a sure sign of weakness . As for the bullets being shot , you 'll notice that all of the bullets were shot at people . Also , it 's widely known that Air Force One is not your ordinairy run of the mill 747 's that regular citizens ride . I would n't be the least bit surprised to find that the entire shell is bullet proof , with bullet proof glass . Even bullets from machine guns ca n't penetrate the armor of armored cars . Air Force One probably has the same material all around the main cabin . Do do any different would put the leader of the free world in serious jepoardy.The acting is crisp , the suspence taunt , the script well written , and the storyline fairly believable . The refuling plane scene , contrary to what some might say , is believeable . A large refueling tanker is a very dangerous job for the exact reason that is shown in the movie . There are safe guards , yeah . But a huge plane taking a sudden dive , with the tanker not diving has a good chance of causing the results in the movie.Do n't just listen to the 1 star reviewers . Think of the cast . Gary Oldman , Harrison Ford , Glenn Close , and others . Think of the director , Wolfgang Peterson . This is a great movie with great acting . SEE IT ! ! !	1
I 'd like to start off by saying that I have n't watched Air Force One in several years , so I 've forgotten whata great film this actually is . I have had the VHS Widescreen version since 1998 , but I 've only watched it once since then . But fast forward to 2002 and now its on Superbit DVD . All I have to say is WOW ! The picture and sound will blow you away . The sound especially if you have a 5.1 surround system . The gun fire is especially intense and well spaced in the the sound field . One of the most jaw-dropping scenes is the F-15/MiG-29 engagement at the end . Another is when Air Force One crashes into the Ocean . WOW ! What a crash scene ! But another thing I 'd like to point out is that it 's strange now that all these films that have to do with terrorists have an all new meaning and message now in our post-9/11 world . If you 'll recall , Oldman 's character was a Russian nationalist who wanted a re-united Russian motherland with the President ( played by Jurgen Prochnow , of Das Boot fame ) of Kazakstan as the Russian Prime Minister . Except that he 's a renegade that wants to use the old Russian nuclear stockpile to terrorize the free world . Oldman states how US foreign policy may be beneficial to the US , but it destroys the lives of other countries . I think he mentions something about the sanctions on Iraq causing undue suffering . So you see , these old terrorist movies should have been a bit of a wake-up call for us.So in closing , if you 're looking for a good terrorist thriller in this post-9/11 world , look no further than Air Force One on Superbit .	1
A great action pack movie.Alot of good acting from everyone in the movie . Well written story and produce.A real thiller .	1
Lots of action , thrills and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat . Harrison Ford is great again , a wonderful movie I will recomend to those who are Ford fans .	1
Movies like this do n't get much respect but this one is really cute . The plot is nothing special , a predictable comedy formula ; Jon Lovitz is a bumbling but good-hearted schlemiel of a teacher in a wild inner city school . But the movie is well written with great jokes and sight gags . At the beginning , Lovitz is teaching in a fancy private school , where the receptionist answers the phone `` Are you white ? '' before she directs the call . The depiction of the mean , arrogant rich boys who study there is painfully accurate . Then he moves to the ghetto school where there is a reserved parking space for the SWAT team . Guards patrol the upper tier of the school auditorium just like a state prison yard . There are many such brilliant touches and Jon Lovitz is loveable as always.Tia Carrere is as lovely as any Hollywood actress could be . Really a beautiful woman , at least as good an actress as Cameron Diaz , and better than Demi Moore . Do n't know why she is always stuck in B space.Fun to watch or rent - recommended	1
I first watched this movie when I was in grade school and never forgot about it . It was the funniest movie I had remember seeing . Definitely a teenager movie some parental discretion is advised .	1
NOW I COULD EASYLY SAY THIS WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE GRATEST MOVE EVER MADE IN THE WORLD THAT IS SO FOR SHORE & THAT IS PUTTING IT LIGHTLY	1
This is a witty team that should go in the record books : Van Damme ( deity ) and Dennis Rodman ( no ability ) . You might think this movie is awful and hideous , but it 's truly a comical look about an action star kicking major stern as usual and a basketball player trying to be an action star . No , basketball players should stick to playing basketball or in this case , cross-dressing . Van Damme carries the ball 'n chain in this movie and makes it work , as expected . He fought a buffed out Mickey Rourke , a man with a knife in his toes and a tiger ! Heroism ! He was an agent who started fresh with a new agency and had to look for Stavros ( Rourke ) . Rodman got in the way too much and actually made an airball . Terrible . Van Damme made fun of him and his hair , 'who does it ? Siegfried or Roy ? ' Pure hilarity . Go Van Damme , do n't take any garbage from that creature . Yes ! A rare comedic performance from a deity .	1
`` Look Who 's Talking '' is probably my favorite film with Kirstie Alley , my favorite film with John Travolta ( though `` Grease '' comes close ) and my favorite film with Bruce Willis ( though I 'm not exactly a fan of his ) . It 's funny , it 's romantic , it 's got some innovative special effects , a couple of car chases , and John Travolta even gets to fly a plane ( which he must have really enjoyed at the time ! ) .Kirstie Alley plays Mollie , an accountant who has an office affair with one of her clients ( George Segal ) , and ends up getting pregnant . It was n't planned , and she 's a little ashamed of the source , but Mollie soon warms to the idea of having a baby . After a traumatic day late in the preganacy , Mollie goes into labor in the middle of the bustling streets of New York , and takes a cab driven by the easy going James ( John Travolta ) . Though it 's not really what he wants to do ( he wants to be a pilot ) he 's very good at driving a cab , and gets Mollie there very quickly . She has the baby , Mikey , and he 's something of a thinker ( voice/thoughts spoken by Bruce Willis ) , wondering to himself what this strange world around him is , and who these strange people around him are . He starts to grow up as time goes on , and Mollie decides to look for a father . She made a mistake , and she owes it to Mikey to find him a Dad . She dates here , she dates there , but could the right Dad be staring her in the face this whole time ? Everyone plays their part well , and the plot flows really nicely , bit of action , bit of a thoughtful moment , bit of a laugh . It 's a romatic comedy of sorts , and it 's a funny look at early motherhood , it 's interesting seeing both happening at the same time . It 's one of those films I can watch again and again , and have done over the years . The soundtrack is great too , a mixture of some older pop hits and contemporary 1980s tunes ( including `` Dumb Things '' by Australian musician Paul Kelly during the taxi labor scene , a song I really like ) .Overall , it 's a sweet and funny little film , a definitely worth a look for fans of anyone in it . Recommended .	1
I really enjoyed this Film.at the time it was a Good Concept but the follow up films Watered down the feelings.John Travolta & amp ; Kirstie Alley were cool in this film.but follow ups made Travolta just a stand by.Sequels are n't always needed .	1
I have always liked this film.I had not seen it in years . It still made me laughOf course , they ran it into the ground when they kept making sequels that just did NOT work.My rating is for the film . I am NOT a fan of Travolta 's . You see him dancing again & his love of filming were put into the filmGood soundtrack to the film , a couple of Beach Boys songs among them.This is a cheap DVD . Where is the wide screen people ? Full screen , that is it . BE CAREFUL WHEN READING PRELOADED INFORMATION ON WEBSITES ABOUT THIS DVD . I HAVE SEEN WHERE THIS DVD SHOWS IT HAS BOTH WIDE & FULL SCREEN . INCORRECT.NO extras at all , no chapter search list.And , of course the other negative . Cheap DVD has 1 of these HORRIBLE plastic DVD cases with the intentional holes in them . HORRIBLE , TERRIBLE & CHEAP . Your DVD can be damaged..If you like the film go ahead & purchase the DVD . But keep in mind all I say above , cheap , NO WIDE SCREEN , extras , & your DVD can be damaged .	1
ABSENCE OF MALICE features performances by Paul Newman and Sally Fields at their very best . When a labor leader comes up dead a legal `` chess game '' ensues between an `` honest '' legal organization and an honorable member of a mob family ( Newman ) . As the media gets involved the plot not only thickens , it literally solidifies , carrying all involved down with it.Wilford Brimley is absolutely terrific and , when the dust settles , seems to be the only member of the establishment with a brain in his head.THE HORSEMAN	1
As with so many excellent actors , Paul Newman is masterful in this movie . If you like and enjoy Newman , this will be one of your favorites .	1
If you enjoy watching films in which arrogant people get their comeuppance , you might enjoy this one.Paul Newman deftly shows how an astute , calculating `` avenger '' can turn the tables on those who have hurt his business and a dear friend . Sally Fields gives a credible performance as a self-absorbed , `` champion of truth '' journalist who 's oblivious to the impact of her stories on people 's lives and livelihood . Wilford Brimley is at his best when he `` reads the riot act '' to each one of the `` culprits '' in the climactic confrontation scene , and , in doing so , ties together the loose ends of the film 's storyline.While the movie lacks the action ( and pace ) of many popular films today , it rewards the thoughtful , patient viewer who appreciates watching a carefully executed revenge . It 's one of my all-time favorites . I 've seen this film about a half dozen times over a period of years and still enjoy it as much today as I did when I first saw it on the big screen .	1
`` Absence of Malice '' has so many excellent performances from so many first rate actors that it 's hard to know where to begin . But let 's begin at the top , with the performance of Wilford Brimley , who in a brief 10 minute appearance as a Department of Justice official , steals the show . Brimley has been in nearly 100 films , starting out in `` True Grit '' ( 1969 ) and giving us memorable performances in `` The Firm '' ( 1993 ) , `` Cocoon '' ( 1985 ) , `` The Natural '' ( 1984 ) and `` The China Syndrome . '' He 's best known as the TV spokesman for Liberty Mutual and Quaker Oats , where he says `` It 's the right thing to do '' which is a line right from this film.The film stars Paul Newman and Sally Field , and features Melinda Dillon , Josef Sommer , Bob Balaban , and Luther Adler.For Paul Newman this 1981 film came at the height of his career . He had 5 Oscar nominations in his belt and 4 more to go , including his sole win ( `` The Color of Money '' , 1986 ) . Sally Field was also at the top of her game having just won the Oscar for `` Norma Rae '' ( 1979 ) . Both stars put in great performances.Melinda Dillon was nominated as Best Supporting Actress for her role in this film , and was also nominated for `` Close Encounters '' ( 1977 ) in which co-star Bob Baladan also appears . She worked in the Group Theatre ( as did co-star Luther Adler ) . She 's made a few dozen films including `` Slap Shot '' ( with Paul Newman ) and `` Harry and the Hendersons '' ( 1987 ) Josef Sommer plays a wise editor at the paper when Field works . Sommer has appeared in more than 100 films and TV shows , including `` Dirty Harry '' ( 1971 ) , `` The Front '' ( 1976 ) , `` Close Encounters '' ( 1977 ) , and `` Witness '' ( 1985 ) . He 's played the President ( `` X-Men : The Last Stand '' ) , Woodrow Wilson ( `` Young Indiana Jones '' ) , Joseph Kennedy Sr. ( `` A Woman Named Jackie '' ) , Gerald Ford ( `` The Betty Ford Story ) , and Franklin Roosevelt ( `` The Kennedys of Massachusetts '' ) . He usually plays the good guy , but he showed us he is equally capable of playing the bad guy as Harrison Ford 's crooked superior officer in `` Witness '' .Bob Baladan has given us memorable performances in more than 50 films . He was nominated for an Oscar in 2002 as an actor ( `` Gosford Park '' ) , twice nominated as a director by the DGA ( `` Bernard and Doris '' and `` Georgia O'Keefe '' ) and nominated for a Tony as Best Actor for `` The Inspector General . '' He had a recurring role on `` Seinfeld '' as Russell Dalrymple . Along with this film I think his best work was in `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind '' ( 1977 ) .Luther Adler is a multi-talented actor that moved gracefully between stage , TV and film . He was the brother of Stella Adler and worked with Lee Strasberg in the Group Theatre . He appeared in the remake of `` M '' ( 1951 ) , played Hitler in `` The Desert Fox '' ( 1951 ) , and played Paul Muni 's colleague in `` The Last Angry Man '' ( 1959 ) . `` Absence of Malice '' was his last film.The film is directed by Sydney Pollack . Pollack was 5 times nominated for an Oscar , and won once ( `` Out of Africa '' ) . He often works with Robert Redford ( 8 films ) . Pollack directed such memorable films as `` Jeremiah Johnson '' ( 1972 ) , `` Tootsie '' ( 1982 ) , and `` Out of Africa '' ( 1982 ) , He said of Paul Newman - `` You can feel his intelligence , you can see him thinking . `` The film is not only compelling as a film , it also provides a good look behind the scenes at a newspaper . Other films to lift the veil include `` The Front Page '' ( 1934 ) , `` Citizen Kane '' ( 1941 ) `` All the President 's Men '' ( 1976 ) , `` Deadline USA '' ( 1952 ) , `` Sweet Smell of Success '' ( 1957 ) , and `` Ace in the Hole '' ( 1951 ) . Like `` Sweet Smell '' this film looks at the abuses of the media , and perhaps more than any other film , it shows that the subject is complex.As good as the film is , it 's far from perfect . The romantic subplot between Field and Newman is out of place and adds little to the plot . The film exposes problems with government and the media , and then suggests that a white knight will come charging in ( Wilford Brimley ) and save the day , which most times is not the case . And the ending is a little weak.This is a film that will appeal to almost everyone , and the plethora of excellent performances only adds to the value .	1
`` Absence Of Malice '' is a movie I 've loved since seeing it in the theater when released . It moves so well , and is so well acted . Of course with two Oscar winners what else would one expect . Sally Fields ' character comes off so appealing , strong yet vulnerable and attractive . Newman plays such a great even keel , classy guy even though people are trying to manipulate him . Every character shines , but is outshined by Wilfred Brimley 's performance in the late scenes . Not only is this a great , dramatic movie , but was ahead of it 's time showing how journalism has come to a sad state . Anyone that enjoys strong acting , but does n't have to have action to be entertained should love this movie.The Blu-ray edition is well worth buying . The extras , the first I 've seen for the movie , are very revealing by cast and crew , including Paul Newman before his death . I 'd highly recommend this movie to anyone , and can be enjoyed by both men and women .	1
Paul Newman displayed why is such a great actor . This movie kept you on the edge of your seat in suspense .	1
If Woodward & Bernstein brought down the Imperial Presidency of Richard Nixon by exposing Watergate , which is arguably a good thing , then it introduced the era of `` Gotcha '' journalism . The press in this country is considered the fourth estate and it certainly has started acting like another branch of the government with the key difference that nobody checks or balances it . In `` Absence of Malice , '' Sydney Pollack 's indictment of the power of the press in the modern era , one man is given good reason to fight the system.Michael Colin Gallagher ( Paul Newman ) is the son of a Mafia boss , long dead , who know owns and runs a liquor warehouse . He knows nothing about anything , but Elliott Rosen ( Bob Balaban ) , the leader of a Justice Department Strike Force who is getting nowhere in southern Florida , leaks a fake story that Gallagher is the subject of an investigation . Smelling blood in the water , reporter Megan Carter ( Sally Field ) goes after the story that is not really there . Gallagher 's life is exposed to the world and as the story that is not there grows it destroys the life of an innocent , Teresa Perrone ( Melinda Dillon ) . At that point Gallagher concocts a plan to bring down everybody , simply by letting them do exactly what they want to do in a nice example of how to give a lot of people enough rope to hang themselves.Unfortunately there the script requires Newman and Field to go through the motions for one of the more unbelievable romances in movie history , which only gets in the way of the focus of the story . You can never believe that she sees him as anything more than a story any more than you can accept that he is able to look past what she is trying to do to see a woman worth loving . Certainly that set up is not necessary for the powerful scene where Gallagher lays hands on Carter to show her exactly how many damage a human being writing a story on a computer can do to another person . But even then , the script asks us to believe that the spark between these two has not been wholly extinguished , and that is not something I can do.But `` Absence of Malice '' is more than saved by the film 's final scene where Gallagher 's trap succeeds brilliantly and Wilford Brimley shows up as Asst . U.S. Atty . Gen. James A . Wells to put the pieces together and dispense a little judicial justice . Carter does too little too late in terms of trying to do something noble , but we are given to believe that she has learned her lesson , although I would certainly like more evidence than this . But even if she goes straight there are plenty of other reporters willing to play the game knowing that they will rarely be held accountable or have to play for any mistakes that they make . This is a depressing film , not just because it tells a depressing story , but because the grim reality it portrays of how the press functions in this country is distressingly true . `` Absence of Malice '' received Oscar nominations for Paul Newman as Best Actor in a Leading Role , although his solid performance is nothing special , and for Melinda Dillon as Best Actress in a Supporting Role as the most memorable character in the film . The scene in which she tries to hide from her family the fact that her name and life are being tossed around on the front page of the newspaper is both chilling and heartbreaking . Kurt Luedtke was nominated for Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and except for the unnecessary and problematic romantic subplot there is plenty of gravity to the story and scenes . Watching this movie again makes me think that the time has come for somebody to go after the state of journalism today and use something more pointed that the stiletto Pollack employs in this 1981 film .	1
Two great stars make this an excellent movie . I really enjoyed how Paul Newman turns the situation around at the end .	1
In my opinion a great Paul Newman movie with some very dramatic scenes.Wilford Brimley plays an awesome no nonsense U.S . Marshal . I very much like what his part had to say .	1
This is a tremendously good movie . It focuses on the harm that an overreaching Federal Government and an irresponsible press can inflict on an innocent private citizen . Paul Newman plays Michael Gallagher , an honest but tough private citizen whose deceased father was a bootlegger and loan shark . A viciously ambitious FBI agent leaks it to the press that Michael Gallagher is under investigation for the death of a labor leader . The press runs with it ( Sallie Field , in a competent but not great performance ) and suddenly Gallagher 's life is being besmirched on the front page of the newspapers . As this process continues lives are ruined , Gallagher 's business is decimated , and more would be telling . The storyline here never drags , and every scene is critical to the story . This film is quite literally riveting.Wilford Brimley makes a fabulous entrance into this film at the end , and without giving anything away , it is a wonderful performance by Brimley , who appears to be the only character here who is truly interested in either common sense or justice . The way he makes sense out of a terrible miscarriage of justice is heart-warming . If only real life worked that way . The rest of the supporting cast is excellent . I was not impressed with Field , in this role . She seemed one-dimensional and not really the right character type for this role . Nor was the chemistry between Newman and Field of much use to the story.The highlight of this film are the performances by Newman and Brimley . Newman is perfect as the rough-hewn but honest Michael Gallagher , and Brimley , as discussed , is brilliant . The real message of this film is the importance of a responsible press and responsible Federal agents . There are too few of either . This film is as relevant as today 's headlines and always will be.A five-star film in all respects . RJB .	1
Great music , great dancing , great story -- in short , sensational . Riverdance is STILL in a worldwide tour , years after Michael Flatley left . The hypnotic dancing moves , the romantic sweep and the Celtic rhythms are truly mesmerizing . In the past couple of years it has become hip to slam Riverdance , but that is only because of its stratospheric popularity . Riverdance is exhilarating entertainment that lifts you up and leaves you with simple joy in life itself.I ca n't think of anything we need more given the events of the past month.Peace .	1
... Colin Dunne does n't upstage his co-preformers . True , I loved the original Riverdance with Flatley , but I think that in the original , his dancing was a few nothces above that of his co-preformers . He carried the entire production . Watch them both back to back and see what you think.Maria Pages and Jean Butler must have just got better overtime , because they steal the show from Dunne . No knock on Dunne his dancing is great , but he does n't have the on-stage presence of Flatley . It 's the other dancers here who are worth the watch.In the original Riverdance , Pages 's feet are flat , thumpy and lag behind the beat sometimes . When Flatley came on to the screen , he just danced circles around her . She has developed wondefully as a dancer . Butler was a natural at the release of the original Riverdance , but she too seems to have become more confident and less mechanical . She is more graceful then ever here.Furthermore , the NYC production has a big budget set and sound . The light show makes the original Riverdance look as though it was filmed in a converted high school gymnasium . The music is clearer in the NYC production and Celtic poetry is thrown in before each dance as punctuation.I also hear a chorus of people saying that they do not like this DVD because of `` technical '' issues and I 'm wondering if somehow a glitched batch of copies were released . The copy that I bought on Amazon in 2001 came packaged with a copy of Les Misrables . Both DVD 's are flawless . The filmwork is excellent and the dancing and music are above par .	1
Thomas Jane , Salma Hayek and Vincent D'Onofrio shine like night stars in the film , & quot ; The Velocity of Gary , & quot ; directed by Dan Ireland with a wit and passion all its own . Opening with the character of & quot ; Gary & quot ; ( that is not his real name , nor is it ever revealed ) , walking through the streets of New York City , clearly in the mood to pick up a guy or two . On the way , he saves a deaf drag queen from getting killed , but regrets it when he follows him everywhere . In comes Salma Hayek as Maricarmen , the lusty yet snappy Latina who is in love with Valentino , played by Vincent D'Onofrio . We soon learn two things : Gary is also in love with Valentino , and Valentino is dying of AIDS from his work as a porn star . Throughout the course of the movie , Maricarmen and Gary argue over what kind of care he should be receiving , and who is going to supply that care . The real waves of emotion come when the time for Valentino 's impending death becomes very short , and the three of them begin to take stock of themselves as well as their relationship with one another . THis movie works the heart in more ways than one , most notably being the dialogue . The line , & quot ; Gary dreams about kissing someone so hard his mouth hurts . He dreams about kissing someone so soft his heart hurts , so long his neck hurts , so deep his throat hurts . Gary dreams about kissing someone so ... completely that nothing hurts , & quot ; is nothing but pure genius on the part of the writers . The sexual inuendo in the film , such as the kiss between Valentino and Gary in the phone room , takes it as far as it can without going into the extreme , and the passion between characters is vivdly evident . The search for one 's purpose in life and where life goes is no more underlined than in this movie , which will move its open-minded viewers to tears of sadness as well as joy .	1
If men kissing men makes you uncomfortable , you 're probably going to want to skip this movie . Otherwise , if you want to look at beautiful people ( men and women , such as the lovely Salma Hayek ) and have a taste of the extreme fast lane and the village lifestyle , you 'll love this movie . Actions speak as loud as words in this low dialog film , the actors manage to be subtle yet readable and understandable . The otherness of their world and their lifestyle was utterly enviable . Also a movie whose viewers would benefit from the use of some , shall we say , mind expanding drugs , as surely as wearing 3D goggles enhances the viewing of 3D movies . Enjoy !	1
Classic Willis and classic Oldman as the baddy . Great story with lots of humour that doesnt distract . Brion James in support as well as a few other familiar faces . Mila , she is HOTand kicks arse .	1
First off , this dvd should be the reference standard to demonstrate the powers that be concerning the excellence in dvd picture and sound quality for this home video medium format ! The colors are rich and daylight bright ( you will be marvelling at LeeLoo 's beautiful crystal blue eyes and bright burning orange hair ) The images are crystal sharp and finely focused ( and , yes I have seen this dvd played on several different makes and models of players and t.v.s ; so , it 's not just the hardware being used ) . The dialogue , surround sound effects , and music went beyond my expectations ! Bruce Willis , Milla Jovovich , and Gary Oldman are perfectly cast . The appearance of Chris Tucker is a memorable one.The gender bending/rock-star/d.j . celebrity character Ruby Rhod is a sheer tongue-in-cheek joke throwing it 's innuendos at another well known & quot ; Purple & quot ; reigning musical artist in real life ! What 's not to love about this movie ? There are good guys , bad guys , state-of-the-art special f/x , excellent music , and eye catching ( yet sometimes confusing ) sets/sceneries.The story or plot may not be profound but the rest of the above mentioned carry it off very well indeed ... P.S. -- I highly recommend the soundtrack . The only error is that the chase scene , between Corben Dallas and the police , containing the salsa-ethnic sounding track sung in Arabic or Middle-Eastern vocals has been omitted !	1
An all time favorite great for whole family barring a few sexual entendres Bruce Willis , Milla Jovovich , Gary Oldman ( Academy Award winner ) Chris Tucker , Et cetera the whole cast is outstanding great script , photography and directionMilla and Director Luc Besson for 2 years she 's Married to Paul W. S. Anderson now this is a great Sci Fy action movie	1
First time I watched this it was one of those three star things that you could take or leave . Yes it had all the elements ( except the fifth ) that make for a good shoot-um-up space thing . But I just looked at it as an action movie.For some reason this movie can grow on you and you find yourself anticipating the next move . Then you see things that you did not see the first time . Then you start to mouth the words . Soon this turns into a five star movie with a plot , good guys , bad guys , and good bad guys . Soon you start looking in your auto-wash to see if you left anything in there.An ancient thereat of dome looms over the earth . An ancient religion keeps the secret of the doom and the secret of the defense ( the fifth element . ) Prophecy turns into reality and it is up to Major Koeben Dallas ( Bruce Willis ) to find the fifth element and save the earth.Will he be able to do this and at what emotional expense ? What is the fifth element ?	1
` The Fifth Element ' , directed by Luc Besson and starring hero Bruce Willis and my favorite heavy , Gary Oldman is something of an enigma to me , because in spite of its high powered stars , excellent story , and strong direction , I took practically no notice of it when it first came out in the theatre . My hypothesis is that part of this excellent movie 's problem is that it is a cross of at least three genres , Science Fiction , Fantasy , and satire . The best illustrations of the last genre is Mel Brooks ' ` Young Frankenstein ' and that great cult hit ` Rocky Horror Picture Show ' . Both are so well realized that they almost work as true horror movies , if it were n't for the fact that they were even better spoofs and comedies. ` The Fifth Element ' , on the surface , looks a bit like that great Science Fiction movie , ` Blade Runner ' , especially since it is such a good pairing of hero ( Harrison Ford ) and heavy ( Rutger Hauer ) , just like our Willis and Oldman duo here . But , ` Element ' just goes too far over the top in the ` what if ' department that you simply ca n't take it seriously . It is almost more like the realization of ` The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ' , except that it never wallows in the absurd the way ` Hitchhiker ' does . And , it takes its story just serious enough to bring it back into serious Fantasy rather than staying in absurdist humor.Another contrast which comes to mind is the fact that this movie has some strong similarities to that greatest of fantasies , ` Lord of the Rings ' , in that both involve a quest by an unwilling hero against seemingly impossible odds . But then , you come back to the humor , and you loose a lot of the epic aura that made ` Lord of the Rings ' so great.If there were nothing else good in this movie , the flick would still be worthwhile for the performance of Milla Jovovich as the title character . This seems like a perfect match of role with actor , just as Brad Pitt 's performance in another Willis vehicle , ` The Twelve Monkeys ' was a great match of actor and role , leading to a strongly deserved Oscar nomination . Other performances are also strong . Oldman , as usual , is the epitome of the droll , yet ultimately menacing heavy . Ian Holm ( also in ` Lord of the Rings ' , to make the parallel just a bit more interesting ) is a perfect parody of a Gandalf like character , but with little backbone and no magic to speak of . Another interesting piece of casting is Brion James ( Rutger Hauer 's sidekick in ` Blade Runner ' ) as a deadpan general commissioned with the job of getting retired soldier Willis to save the world . And , Chris Tucker is just flat out over the top goofy , fitting his role to a tee , squared.I have never been especially impressed with Bruce Willis ' acting in movies past , but he always seems to fit his roles like a glove . In this role , someone like Schwarzenegger could not be cynical enough , Harrison Ford would probably be too serious , Tom Cruise would probably be too earnest , and Clint Eastwood is too old ( and making too much money as a director ) .Except for the fact that the story is far too original , it has all the feel of a graphic novel serialized in ` Heavy Metal ' . Both the goofy story and the bazaar art direction ( check out the police uniforms and compare them to the typical Mobius drawings in ` Heavy Metal ' ) .One sure sign that the story is being played for melodrama and laughs is the scant 2 seconds by which our heroes save the Earth , by a kiss , of course . This business is straight out of ` Goldfinger ' , another film that plays suspense for its melodrama and humor.Two sure signs that this is a worthwhile movie is that it is fun to rewatch at least once a year and it is fun to write about.Recommended for fans of humor , fantasy , and science fiction , in that order .	1
I confess , this is the DVD I put in when I want to show-off my Home Theater . The colors and images are remarkeable . The story..well , it is simple and does not distract from the movie . Bruce Willis does Bruce Willis really well , and that 's not meant as a criticism . Of the other chracters , the priest is excellent , as is Gary Oldman 's cartoonishly menacing bad guy.Light entertainment , would never win an Academy Award , but who cares ? Fun in most ways.Bottom line ? I bought it .	1
Luc Besson ( director ) ; Bruce Willis ; Gary Oldman ; Ian Holm ; Milla Jovovich ; Chris Tucker & Luke Perry ; what a line-up ! ! USA ; UK ; Ukraine ; & France all represented . Very , very entertaining . Yes , it could happen ? ? ! ! Costumes byJean-Paul Gaultier ; looks like he had a great time with it ; so even Bruce worn some daring stuff . Yes , I 've seen this more than once . Thanks .	1
Lots of different features with this edition . Puts the film in a new , more interesting perspective . Luc Beeson 's vision is really described well here !	1
Very good Bruce movies to watch . Story is excellent and it 's premiss is fun to watch over and over again .	1
This film has to be one of the most famous and loved classic syfi movies , it 's one of my all time favorite movies , love the effects and comedy , love it ! ! !	1
This film is a cross between `` Blade Runner '' and `` Flash Gordon . '' It has the slick special effects and subtley smart script of the first mixed with the over-the-top look and complete campiness of the second . But what makes this fun to watch more times are the ridiculous antics of all the characters with their overacting , brilliantly stupid costumes , and really bad haircuts . Bruce Willis reprises his `` Die Hard '' role this time in an expensive sci-fi setting and he pulls off the action hero well . What 's great about Bruce Willis is that he is the underrated `` every-guy '' caught in an amazing situation ; and unlike most hero-types who never get hurt during the course of their adventure , Mr. Willis once again takes some bloody shots . But he emerges smiling in the end , albeit covered with grit , draped in torn clothing stained in his enemy 's blood . This is also a perfect fit for Milla Jovovich . Unlike the appalling `` The Messenger '' in which her overacting was so bad as to be laughable , here it melds well with the overall campy feel of the movie . Gary Oldman is very nearly too much even for this extravaganza , but eventually can be forgiven for trying too hard . While Chris Tucker steals every scene he is in . Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer . The first time I saw this , in the theater , I was rolling my eyes at his painful performance . But every time since I 've laughed at his work here repeatedly . What was a personally nice surprise here was Ian Holm who plays Priest Cornelius . It 's truly a rare film to find him using his comic talents . Most times he is playing Shakespearean types or other pompous British characters . Here , however , he is very funny . This film cost $ 60 million to make , and the special effects were worth every penny . Just remember that this is , in essence , a comical sci-fi adventure story , and really should n't be taken seriously . Later .	1
A must have movie , came when promised as promised would get from them anytime they have something I really want	1
This movie is absolutely fantastic . A kick , thriller , Sci Fi , Love story with a wonderful moral backdrop , that somehow still screams 1997 . Piece of art .	1
I just love this movie . This is one of my favorite movies . I went to see this movie at the movie theatre whenit orginally came out . My favorite part is when the Diva sings and when the fifth element says `` MULTIPASS '' . So as soon as the movie was over I headed to the record shop to get the soundtrack of it so that I could hear the diva again . The movie draws you in from the beginning . It is also very believable that this may be how New York may turn out in the future . I really enjoyed the extras on the DVD . Specially the Diva .	1
FIfth Element is a raucous sci-fi journey that plays like a 2 hour MTV music video . Strap yourself in , and enjoy the ride.The plot ... the personification of all that is EVIL in this world is on a crash course with earth . Corbin Dallas ( Bruce Willis ) is an unknowing hero sucked into the chaos that unravels in this non-stop action movie . He must unite the 4 elements ( wind , earth , fire , water ) with a mysterious 5th element before the EVIL destroys Earth.Other than Bruce Willis ' straight man role , virtually every other performance is WAY over the top . Opitimized by Chris Tucker in his debut role as a Futuristic Radio DJ of the # 1 Galatic Show . And in this case , Over-the-Top is good . For it marries perfectly with Luc Besson 's directorial style . You feel like Bruce Willis ' character being swept into a whirl-wind world that is glitz , glam , grunge , techno to the MAX.The most enjoyable parts of the movie are the Music Montages . There are several with which Luc Besson shows off his roots ( directing music videos ) in a brilliant array of MUSIC , ACTION and tremendously fast-paced cut scenes.The DVD is absolutely stunning . If you are into featurettes , cast/director commentary , dvd-rom , and other ancillary items ... this DVD is not going to please your palette . The 4 menu items are : Play Movie , Audio Set Up , Subtitles , Scene Selection . Basically the barebones of DVD features . But do NOT be turned of by this . Because if you are an audio/video-phile looking for the BEST image quality and the BEST sound quality ... this dish will feed your hunger . This DVD is one of the first 5 SUPERBIT encoded DVD 's ever . Basically , the information on your DVD is bits of digital information . Your DVD player will get information from the DVD in bits/sec . Now double the bits/sec of a standard DVD , and the result is crystal clear image quality ( the best I 've ever seen on ANY DVD ) , and ear shattering sound ( once again , the best I 've ever heard on ANY DVD ) . Star Wars , Episode I is close , but this is the king of the hill right now . I could n't imagine a better movie to show off the Super Bit technology.This DVD may lack the frills of a & quot ; Collector 's Edition & quot ; DVD , but the great story , incredible directing , and superlative image and sound quality makes this DVD a must have . Especially if you have a 5.1 stereo and HD-TV that you want to show off . But do keep the Subwoofer down , you 'll wake the ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD .	1
I saw this in the theater way back when . I had no idea what it was . It was a hugely delightful surprise . Pure candy . I got the Ultimate Version with the extra features disc . It has an interview with designer Mobius ( Jean Giraud ) ! I 've watched this thing all the way through at least twenty times , and I 've seen random chunks of it on TV hundreds of times . It never gets old . This is the only real HEAVY METAL movie . The crappy parts are completely outweighed and negated by the movie 's overwhelming general excellence . I would give it many more than five stars if Amazon did n't so cruelly limit that option .	1
This is one of the coolest movies I have ever seen , and one of my favorite that I own ! The story is set in a futuristic world with high-tech flying cars , tall buildings , crazy weapons , revealing outfits for ... . NO ! not for Bruce Willis , but for Milla Jovovich , who plays & quot ; Leeloo & quot ; ! I really do n't want to give away much of the story , because it 's really interesting and I do n't want to ruin it for you ( if you have n't seen it ) . But I can tell you that this movie is very very cool ! It keeps you interested from start to finish . The high-tech gizmos are also very cool and imaginative . The monsters are n't too scary , but they are abnormal enough to be convincing bad guys ! This is a great science-fiction movie , highly recommended ! Be prepared for a fun ride through a very creative futuristic world with lots of action and cool aliens ! Again , I highly recommend this film ! ENJOY ! ! ! ! !	1
This review is for the remastered Blu-ray ( catalog number 21520 ) .I do n't think I really need to review the film itself . Fifth Element may not be a perfect film , but it 's so much fun , has so many familiar faces , great lines , and memorable moments , it deserves five stars . Unfortunately , I have to knock off a star for the lazy remaster . Maybe I 'm spoiled by recent better remasters of even older films , but visual artifacts are easily visible in this remaster , notably in some of the starfield scenes ( greenish haze , a gray box around the starliner pre-hyperspeed ) and in some faces ( the Diva during her concert ) . I 'm glad to be able to watch this great movie in HD , but it would 've been really nice if they 'd put some effort into cleaning up these artifacts during the remaster .	1
I saw this at the movies not expecting much , boy was I surprised . The cinematography is wonderful , I loved the use of color in the film . The special effects were very well done . This movie was very entertaining and I love the fact that it does'nt take itself too seriously .	1
This is one of my favorite films . It is defiantly a world that is intriguing and mind blowing . A great add to my collection .	1
The name `` Bruce Willis '' usually means it is going to be an excellent film . This time Bruce Willis tries a CGI-effects science fiction film . This is his 30th film.In `` Languages '' , you must press on `` English 5.1 '' to get sound for the film.You may choose `` Fact Track '' to receive facts about the film in English or Spanish while film is playing . It will replace subtitles.Bruce Willis plays `` Korben Dallas '' , your typical alpha-male who wakes up with a cigarette , stereo playing and television on . He also owns a white pussycat that keeps coming back home.It 's the year 2214 . Willis drives a mid-air taxi-cab ( remember the Jetson 's airship ? ) where on this day he picks up Milla Jovovich ( Resident Evil [ 2002 ] , Resident Evil : Apocalypse [ 2004 ] ) . It guess orange hair is still in style . She was just re-created and talks in babbling.McDonald 's Restaurant is still around on the 25th floor with a whole new meaning to `` drive-in '' .Disc 2 includes the `` Special Features '' . Too many to list , but some highlights are : The Star Element : Interviews with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich.The Diva featurette includes interview with Maiwenn who played the Diva Plavalaguna . This will also include the entire performance of Maiwenn against green screen.Note : Maiwenn played the Diva Plavalaguna , but was lip-syncing the opera . It is soprano , Inva Mula 's voice doing the aria .	1
This movie is so freaking cool . Most the time , I try to avoid such juvenile uttering when commenting on whatever I happen to be writing about , but somehow that sentence summarizes this movie better than even the most sophisticated linguistics.Everything works . More than anything , it 's absurdly entertaining . This , I believe , is mostly due to the phenomenal sense of pace , combined with the fact that there is almost never content on the screen that is n't interesting and thoroughly unique . The cinematography is excellent , the costumes are fabulous , and the special effects unrivaled for its time ( '97 ; the only film comparable in my opinion being 'Starship Troopers ' , which actually exceeds this ) . The acting is also respectable , particularly Jovovich as the `` fifth '' , Ian Holm with his fidgety performance as an almost messianic priest , and , perhaps most fun of all , Chris Tucker 's manic , slaphappy D.J. , filled with bizarre , eccentric energy that 's little else than hysterical.Speaking of energy -- this movie has it in spades . It also does such a wonderful job of combining utter professionalism ( what with the awe inspiring set pieces and virtually every other technical aspect ) with a demeanor that never takes itself too seriously . And yet , while the movie does maintain a loose , jovial personality ( goofy would also apply , but it sounds a bit demeaning ) , it even works -- at least somewhat -- in its few , short dramatic bits . By no means are these the reason to view the movie , but I still find them engrossing and reasonably emotive.One element that 's also worth mentioning is Eric Serra 's score , which is impressively dynamic . The action scenes are distinctly scored unlike most action films , with a fluffy , almost lounge-like mood , and in other scenes he employs contemporary synthesizers that create a refreshingly chill ambience . The primary theme which underscores the dramatic moments -- employed around most scenes revolving around the fifth element -- is eloquent and moving . I give the guy a lot of credit with his composition here , for sure.I do n't have many complaints . There are a few things that do n't make absolute sense , but I have such a good time I have no intention of diverting my attention to call them out , at least in a negatively affecting manner . Luc Besson is in top form here ( though surely the film is n't as emotionally captivating as his prior masterpiece , 'The Professional ' ) , and I totally respect him for 'The Fifth Element , , as he dives into the sci-fi genre with grace , humility , imagination , individuality , and filmmaking valor.So yeah -- the result is bizarrely creative and fantastically witty . A sci-fi ADVENTURE , forged in a day which finds itself difficult to find a film that could accurately be deemed as such .	1
I got my item . the fifth element steelbook . It was in very good shape . The Packaging was good . I look forward to do more business .	1
The Fifth Element starring Bruce Willis and the ever beautiful and alluring Milla Jovovich is definitely among my most favorite films of all time . This is one of those rare films that I can watch over and over again , despite a good majority of it being based in comedy where you 'd think it would get old but it does n't . Bruce Willis 's performance is up to par with his `` hero '' persona and right on with his comedic tendencies . Milla Jovovich , wow ! She is incredibly beautiful and was extraordinarily well matched for this particular role . Gary Oldman also does an outstanding job as the `` quasi '' villain of the film as he 's set as the comedic pawn of evil . Visually , director Luc Besson puts to screen an interesting futuristic earth.The premise : Set approximately three hundred years in the future , this outstanding film begins with a look into the past setting up the need for the `` fifth '' element . Cutting back to the future we meet Korben Dallas ( Bruce Willis ) who is a retired Major from Earth 's military ! He 's down on his luck and working as cab driver . We then have the privilege of seeing Leeloo ( Milla Jovovich ) being reconstructed ! Through chance and circumstance Leeloo literally flings herself into Korben 's cab . What follows from this point is nothing short of one of the most hilarious and intriguing Sci-Fi/comedy films to grace the silver screen and the home theater ! Special Features : If you 're into DVD 's jam packed with all kinds of special features , `` The Fifth Element '' is n't for you ! Normally , this is something I do not mind as the main reason I purchase DVD 's is for the film itself , in this case though it would 've been nice to at least thrown in a theatrical trailer or something , but alas there are no special features on this DVD.I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the genre or the stars that perform so admirably in this film ! { ssintrepid }	1
Yeah , I really like this film . Definitely a must see if you are a fan of science fiction . Bruce Willis is also one of my favorite actors . Buy it now ! ! !	1
Honestly , most of the movie is very nice in the blu ray format . But it is I think quiet a shame when right at the beginning you have this nice overview of the temple and the sky is just THE NOISIEST SKY I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A MOVIE . I mean come on , even a movie that has 640x480 pixels of resolution will display better than that ... later in the first space scene , the white halo around the reactors of the Mondo-shawans spaceship is really noisy too . But when you pass that I guess it is ok . I never had the impression when watching a DVD before that there were good or bad transfers . Since I have the blu ray player and a TV that can actually display some real 1080p I see that at least in the blu ray collection you have good or bad transfers . Luckily we have Amazon reviews to know which one are the good and which are the bad ... about the movie , well I like it a lot so not to much to say about that .	1
What a knock-out ! For anyone who wants to have great entertainment and has the facilities of widescreen television and DTS amplifier with complete surround sound system - this is one that will have your chin hitting the floor with its superb visual and audio effects . I had already seen this on VHS but there is no contest after viewing it on DVD . The story is great and the acting can not be faulted . One of the very best of its genre . Definitely NOT to be missed . Warn the neighbours - turn up the volume , sit back and have a great time !	1
This movie is a great goof of a movie , two hours plus of pure tongue-in-cheek fun . Bruce Willis looks a lot less bored than he has recently , Milla Jovavich ( sp ? ) is luscious and Chris Tucker is a hoot .	1
This movie could be a classic . Good storyline which combines scifi with comedy . The actors seem to have fun in doing it and they do not seem to take themselves seriously and thus it adds to the whole idea of the movie . Good effects.Like some other reviewers I did notice that the picture quality is not like othe blue-rays but it is not as bad as it is described.All in al a recommended movie that oyu will enjoy	1
Without going into a lengthy diatribe I will simply say if you have an older version of this disc ( 'Full HD 1080 ' box is missing on the back ) and you enjoy this film , buy this updated Blu-Ray . Not only will you see things you missed before ( the ugly scar on right shoulder of Bruse Willis for instance ) but you will hear sounds and music in such an enhanced way you might think you 're watching a new 'editor 's cut ' of the movie . All scenes are sharper and more pronounced . I was sceptical about this version Blu-Ray being improved enough to warrant the money outlay . Boy were my misgivings ill-chosen . This is one of my top-ten 'Best of ' Blu-Ray discs . My only concern now is could all the Blu-Ray discs I purchased during this early period in the format also be in need of such an upgrade ? My pocketbook shudders ! Note : the price of this new version fluctuates wildly . I guess as sales increase the market value increases . I have a difficult time understanding what excatly determines the price of Blu-Rays in this market . Interesting enough I purchased this disc recently on Amazon at half the current price . So if you want to buy make purchasing this disc what I call a 'fishing expedition sale ' . Put the disc purchase on hold until the price drops . It might take days , weeks or months but it will come down . In the meantime savor the thought that this is going to be an overwhelming viewing experience made better because you were patient and waited for the best price . This works for me anyway when it comes to Blu-Ray discs . I have n't paid more than $ 10 for any favorite Blu-Rays in a very long time . Good Blu-Ray is like good wine : it 's always more enjoyable when the price is right.When the price finally drops do n't hesitate- pounce -and get ready for a night of viewing enjoyment that will leave you smiling.Equipment : Panasonic Blu-Ray player feeding HDMI into a 7.1 Yamaha receiver ; HDMI out and into a 50 '' Panasonic plasma . Great sound and great visuals .	1
I loved this movie . It in the theatre , caught it on cable and bought in on video.I have just gotten a DVD player and this was one of the first 4 movies that I bought ( the others : & quot ; Jaws & quot ; , & quot ; Das Boot : Director 's Cut & quot ; and & quot ; Monty Python and the Holy Grail & quot ; ... see ? I 've covered all the bases ! ) & quot ; The Fifth Element & quot ; is a blast . Wonderfully done with all the principals ( Willis , Oldman , Holm , Jovovich and esp . Tucker ) in great form . Tucker was the stand out for me , stealing the show as he did in & quot ; Friday & quot ; .No goodies on this DVD except standard or widescreen , no & quot ; making of & quot ; , etc . Just the film .	1
This movie has everything you ask for a sci-fi movie ... . action , humor and special effects well integrated.The plot is really cool , and Ruby is something else ... I could n't stop laughing at the theatre ... .The DVD is well done , but lacks of special features , it 's great it has spanish dub and sub , a DVD is suppoused to have those options ... . It 's single layer ... I do n't like that much , but it is n't a problem.So , if you like sci-fi movies , this must be in your collection .	1
Every now and then a film comes along with surprising wit and humor for its genre . THE FIFTH ELEMENT should n't work , based on the fact that it is so aggressively imaginative compared to other sci-fi films . But it is one of the most delightful films I 've seen in a while . Milla Jovovich is to die for , particularly in the enchanting costume in which she debuts in this movie -- as remarkable a piece of cloth engineering as I 've ever seen on a young woman -- and Milla looks fabulous . Her character , the sweet and somewhat naive Lillu , is irresistible , and I fell for her faster than Bruce Willis ' taxi driver did.The plot is powered by a save-the-planet search for a missing & quot ; fifth element , & quot ; which Gary Oldman 's villain wants to acquire as badly as anyone else in the movie . But the genius of this story is injecting a big dose of warmth and humanity into this effects extravaganza , giving the film such appealing characters and such high humor that there 's never a dull moment . Even a minor character like the electric blue opera-singing alien wins us over so quick that we care when she is wounded shortly after she 's been introduced.Some think the & quot ; Ru Paul-like & quot ; talk show host steals the movie , others think the squealing he-she is an irritant . Frankly , I find & quot ; her & quot ; much easier to take than , say , Joe Pesci 's character in the Lethal Weapon sequels . I guess it 's a matter of personal taste . In any case , this movie fulfills its promise beautifully and is surprisingly engaging and entertaining given its wild art direction and sci-fi environment . It is surely going into the history books with films like BLADE RUNNER among the best cinematic sci-fi achievements .	1
This is one of the movies I 've never gotten tired of watching . I do n't really know why , but after seeing this film probably 75 or more times -- I did n't see it in the theater , sadly -- and knowing most of its dialog by heart , I just love to keep watching every single minute of it.Thumbnail synopsis : In 2263 , Evil returns to threaten Earth and all existence , necessitating the intervention of the Fifth Element , a `` perfect '' being , who we eventually learn lacks only one thing . A priest , the global government , an evil corporate strongman , both Samaritan and mercenary aliens , henchmen , and a former intergalactic special forces officer now a NYC cab driver all participate in the adventure to save the day.Simply , this is a perfect film , in that it has just about everything that any moviegoer would want to see : clearly defined good and bad guys , explosions , shoot ` em up , physical and subtle comedy , interesting characters , fun music , outstanding special effects , the standard Good vs . Evil , unexpected plot twists , space battles , engaging mysteries , memorable lines , aliens , ancient prophecy , sci-fi , very straightforward characters , fantastic costuming , a subtle little hint of sex , some minor yet tasteful T & A ; , and love as the ultimate plot device . You get all this and more , with no profanity , no blood and guts , and no torture.I consider this a family film , and both my kids ( 13/11 ) love this film as much as I do . But at PG-13 , for a couple of scenes of bad guys gunning down policemen , I caution that parents will have to decide on their own . The plot has some subtleties that an attentive adult viewer will get and enjoy , but the storyline is clear , direct and straightforward , and young kids can easily follow it.Now , I 'm no Academy ( tm ) voter , but I 've always thought Milla Jovovich acted her butt off in this film . It 's a difficult role , that of a genetically tuned supreme being who is reborn on a DNA reconstruction table and minutes later has to escape to carry out her mission to save Earth and all existence . I think she does a masterful job all the way through ; I do n't get the criticisms of her performance . Bruce Willis is basically the same smooth guy you know and love , same as inMoonlighting , Die Hard , Pulp Fiction , Sin City , Tears of the Sun , etc. -- the same quiet yet powerful , determined , normal , inescapably masculine action hero he 's always been , with an orange shirt and different hair color.One of the things I like best about this film is that the characters are not stock , but it 's clear who they are and what role they play . Good and bad are clearly discernable from the outset . The best example of these unexpected characters is Chris Tucker 's seriously divergent Ruby Rhod , a hyperpopular intergalactic radio host with a penchant for bad drag feminine makeup and hair , but also unmistakably manly when the moments come ( think a 23rd century Prince ) . He is both foil and comedy relief , playing a sliver of the trite female sidekick role , but in a new and seriously refreshing manner.The costuming is fantastic throughout , different from the usual Hollywood glop , designed to make all the good guys look fabulous and glamorous and the bad guys as dirty , evil and fashion-challenged . As all costumes are Gaultier , they are way interesting , from Zorg 's iridescent tunic to Leloo 's mini white T and orange body halter/sling , with scientists and technicians in dumpy yet engaging scrubs.The music is great , too , also different but in keeping with the film . There is a great deal of European influence and feel to the score , very French , and also very North African . I recommend the soundtrack recording , and even have bought one of theKhaledalbums used in the film ( but not featured on the soundtrack ) .The production is highly Euro , specifically French , which may have been why it did n't really do that well at the box office . During the totally cool car chase , the music is a North African/Mediterranean rai mix , which is very cool , but not the kind of thing that most Americans are used to hearing on a daily basis . Plavalaguna 's performance at Phloston Paradise begins with pure opera , and slides into an electronically enhanced hip-hop voice mix.The F/X are top-notch throughout , not the least bit cheezy . In fact , the film was nominated for a best visual effects Oscar , as well as for its sound effects editing ( check out the awesome sound of Zorg 's weapon when he unloads on Leeloo in the hotel suite ) . It was nominated for and won many more awards for cinematography , direction , costuming and effects , production design , and more.There is lots of trivia and lots of fun facts about this film ; [ ... ] . One of my favorites is that the big Phloston Paradise explosion to cap off the fight with the Mangalores remains the biggest indoor Hollywood movie explosion of all time , and that it just about got away from them.The ethnic/cultural range is amazing in this film ; dare I interpret an intentional effort to show a future of seamless integration and race neutrality ? Good guys and bad guys are all races , colors , and there are no pathetic stereotypes . You 've got all manner of wonderfully unexplained characters , a goofy son , a bad but dimwitted henchman , expendable police officers , shapeshifting punks ( one in a transparent mini-skirt ! ) , a clueless robber , a radiological Rasta , Indian pilots , Polynesian dancers and musicians , an idiot German actor , black , white , yellow , even blue , and throughout both black and white playing prominent roles . It 's refreshing.Bottom Line : This isn'tCitizen Kane , or evenBlade Runner ( although the influence is obvious ) . But , this is an immensely fun film depicting the classic Good vs . Evil struggle , but told in a different context , with blessedly new characters , costumes and situations . It 's no saccharine-sweet Disney glopfest , but at the same time it is most definitely not ugly , cynical , cruel or gory . I recommend it completely .	1
Look people who judge this movie harshly are judging by regular standards . You cant with this movie . This isnt about seriousness , well written or great story telling . This movie is almost a genre of its own that has to be appreciated for what it is alone . Im a great fan of Sci Fi and know this makes joke of serious sci fi viewing , but it has its own unique style and one liners that never ceases to crack me up with laughter and Im not an easy one to make laugh . I love this movie simply for its own sake and all the characters are unique some funny some serious . Gary Oldman really makes this one and Milla Jovovitch adds that magical gorgeous element.The Blu Ray quality is exceptional ! They did an excellent job in re-mastering what is a reasonably older film . No extras to talk of . I waited for a reasonable price , got it at $ 8.99 and have no regrets buying it and will definately keep to watch again sometime in the future . Its light and entertaining thats all its meant to be.If you found my words helpful to you at all please vote on it . Thanks .	1
This is one of the best reference Blu-ray films out . The original version was bad , but this Remastered edition is perfect.You can see every film grain clearly , like it 's the first time it 's going through the reel at the theater . No digital smoothing here , just the raw experience of film .	1
The Fifth Element is an overall superbly done film , well-acted as it is hilariously entertaining . Not the best actor around , Chris Tucker gives a hilarious performance as a near psychotic radio host , and Bruce Willis is the hero as he is in much of every film he plays in . The music for The Diva ( who is brutally murdered ) is performed superbly and is gorgeously sung .	1
DNA before DNA was fashionable . This is an excellent movie about using DNA for selective purposes . Rather than give the plot away get it and watch it and be fascinated .	1
Gattaca , in a word , is a brilliant science fiction film.No matter where you look , Gattaca astounds you , and holds up against the years . It is destined to become a science fiction classic.Ethan Hawke gives a flawless performance as Vincent Freeman , one of the last natural humans in a world of genetic enhancement , pre-birth specialization , and advanced science . Jude Law , in perhaps his finest performance ever , beautifully portrays a tortured and broken wreck of a man . Uma Thurman plays a femme fatale , and Alan Arkin , the scene-stealing noirish detective ( Gattaca pays a lot of homages to film noir classics of old ) . The rest of the cast gives brilliant performances , and the result is a character driven sci-fi ( Solaris , Blade Runner ) , rather than a tech-driven sci-fi ( Aliens , Star Trek Into Darkness ) .The characters hold up just as well . Each is real , sympathetic , layered , and deep.Andrew Niccol , writer of The Truman Show , directs with subtle nuance , attention to detail , and an eye for a good image . The cinematography of Gattaca is astounding , atmospheric , and very beautiful , with throwbacks to sci-fi films of old such as Blade Runner , and the great cinematic film noirs . The sets and technology fit the film perfectly - never showy ( as sci-fi films often tend to be ) but perfectly fitting the world of the film.The action and suspense pack Gattaca to the top . The suspense is kept on full burn the entire film , with Vincent being suspected of the brutal murder of a flight planner . A riveting cat-and-mouse game begins between the characters , with myriad twists , turns , and agonizingly tense bursts of action.But at it 's core , Gattaca is a film with a heart . It has an emotional core to it , a sensitive , at times romantic and sad core . It 's ending is both thrilling , intensely touching , and brilliant . It also asks important questions about ethics , the nature of science , mankind , and genetics . It 's view of the future is believable , entertaining , and ingenious.Gattaca is one of cinema 's most underrated science fiction films . A character driven masterpiece , with brilliant acting and direction , cool tech , a brilliant story , and a thought-provoking core , Gattaca is destined to reign with cinema 's all-time great sci-fi films.5 Stars ! Strongest Recommendation !	1
Ethan Hawke was wonderful in this futuristic movie ; their technology was working fine and they live deliciously with it . I think I would like this future ; there is very little I would want to escape from .	1
I rewatch this DVD every year . It never fails to move me . It is my favorite style of science fiction -- very real and even probable in its suspenseful plot and deeply human issues . This is the story of a modern hero who fights to fulfill a destiny of his choice , rather than the one dictated to him by society because of his genes . The movie makes you think , will the day come when genetically engineered humans will lord it over normally born people ? Of course ! That day already is dawning , with some companies testing employees for flaws such as drug use , smoking and certain diseases . Ethan Hawke , Jude Law and Uma Thurman lead an excellent cast in a well paced story that gives you time to think and feel . The music is wonderful and the ending both poignant and and satisfying . Highly recommended .	1
This is one of my favorite films ... EVER . The plot and premise are artistically crafted , the acting is superb - Ethan Hawke , Uma Thurman , Jude Law , Xander Berkley , Alan Arkin , Ernest Borgnine , Tony Shalhoub ( it also has a rare and brilliant appearance by Gore Vidal in a significant role ) and it is not overwhelmed with gratuitous special effects . It is a piece of art , even the title and name of the facility is crafted to reflect the topic of the film , the letters in Gattaca comprise the letters of the proteins in DNA . The messages in the film are nothing short of tremendous about the human will , turning our weaknesses into strengths , achieving our goals and the darker tendencies of society to categorize and box in our potential . It is an emotional roller coaster you will never forget . I ca n't recommend it highly enough . If you liked the Shawshank Redemption , I thought this was a far better film .	1
`` Gattaga '' is a masterpiece . Firstly , it is a timeless movie . Released in 1997 you would expect it to seem dated by 2006 but it is far from it . Instead of using `` futuristic '' clothing and hairstyles , etc the director chose to give the movie a classic feel with hints of the 1920 's and 1950 's with just the smallest `` futuristic '' twists . The result is a movie that does n't make you cringe at what people then thought the future would look like.As we delve further into genetic science , what `` Gattaga '' portrays is more thana little bit likely to happen . There will be a new kind of class system and a new type of discrimination ... all of which will be decided by a simple blodd test mapping out the sequence of one 's DNA.I am 27 years old and have had cancer twice . Had my husband been able to discover at the beginning of dating me that one year into our relationship I would be having surgery and radiation therapy due to the cancer I wonder if he still would have considered me a candidate for a mate . Since the cancer ( and reading up on how hereditary it is ) he now thinks if we have children we should get someone else 's eggs ( not mine ) to `` ensure '' our children to not receive my defect.This is the subtle beginning of what Gattaga is all about . I am not into sci-fi very much but I adore this movie onb every level : plot , character developement , cinematography and especially the music ( score ) .	1
That 's my favorite line in the movie where Uma Thurman 's character says & quot ; Not so long , just once around the sun. & quot ; Referring to how long a year away from Ethan she will be . When I saw this film I was in science class , and the teacher said we were going to be watching a movie , I was excited but not so excited because all the movies we watch in school suck ... but this one was great ! I loved it instantly . The music is the best in this movie ! The film is brilliantly done , & quot ; visionary & quot ; and the dialogue is great also . I think its the most perfect science fiction film , but I would n't just categorize it as a sci fi but more as a drama or love story .	1
This movie could be boiled down to today 's ideals , talent = greatness . Two of the main characters who were genetically superior found themselves at a disadvantage according to their superior genes , they did n't want something near as much as Vincent because they were given more and had less to prove ... kind of . It 's one thing to be a failure , it 's another to be a failure with everything going for you.It 's a touching movie and as far as sci-fi goes , it is , in my opinion , one of the better .	1
`` Gattaca '' is the perfect example of how a very good movie can be made without spending tons of money producing it . All the emphasis is placed on the story , a very good story I might add , rather than dazzling special effects and inner ear damaging surround sound . Hollywood should take some lessons from this film and give the public more fare that uplifts and inspires rather than the apocalyptic doom and gloom they keep pushing on us . I try to rent movies on blu ray before I buy them to see if they are worth the additional cost , which is what I did here . The Blockbuster copy I rented , was excellent , has a lot more zip and sparkle than the dvd version that I own . The Amazon price is right and I will be buying the blu ray version .	1
Gattaca is a wonderful film that is likely to earn more respect and recognition as time passes . This is thoughtful science-fiction at its best . Stylish and credible , Gattaca is vastly under-rated . I give it my highest recommendation.Gattaca 's greatest power may be its ability to inspire . Many are certain to walk away from this film with the feeling that they really can make a good run at their dreams , no matter their background or supposed limitations.As we get deeper into the 21st century with all it 's gifts and burdens , humans may find that they need the human spirit more than ever to cope . ( to be clear , by `` human spirit '' , I mean imagination , ambition , drive and our knack for achieving `` impossible '' goals ) This is an eye-opening survey of prominent historical figures who did not believe in a god . Readers are sure to find many surprises here.Haught is the editor of West Virginia 's largest newspaper . As a seasoned newspaper man , he knows how to skip needless words and get to the point .

After 12 Monkees , this is the most daredevil film concerned with a future not so far.A fable based on an uncertain future where the citizens are genetically engineered to be perfect will be the dramatic device to an invalid man who dreams of space travel and assumes the identity of a perfect worker . Everything seems under control but , the strategic planning has nothing to do with the randomness of the existence.Science and scientists often serve the existing powers . But the level of increasing complexity and advanced technological level are molding a state into the state . The nature of power can acquire hues of major repercussion that we ever know . In this new state of things the law 's spirit may become a simple spectator giving unsatisfactory answers and acting with a terrible handicap on its shoulders . There are many ethic and moral abysses that must be discussed and considered , the facts do n't let to exist simply because we ignore them . And sooner than later the mankind will have to face this dilemma.Magnificent script with precognitive situations and riddles for solving . A winner film which threw to Jude Law to fame 's sand around the world .	1
`` I am here to tell you that it is possible , that it IS possible '' . -- VincentI have watched this movie 3 times since its box office disappointing release 15 years ago.I am now convinced this is one of the greatest films of all time . I do n't say that lightly . I watch a LOT of old films and watched most of Roger Ebert 's top 100 films of all time . In my opinion , this movie belongs in that list.What makes a film great ? To me , a greatness of a film is measured similar to a great music . A great music can be enjoyable , visceral , fascinating even after repeated hearings and many years of absence . This movie has that quality to me . Even though I knew its plot and its ending , the movie kept me fascinated and drawn into the characters unlike most films.Made with shoe-string budget and awful marketing ( it was marketed as an Orwellian futuristic film which does n't do it justice ) , the movie is about the triumph of the human spirit and how everything becomes possible once we commit our heart and soul with ruthless determination . `` You want to do how I did it ? I never saved anything for the swim back '' . Committment , dedication , determination , belief ... everything IS possible.The movie , however , is mindful that no one achieves success alone . Why would anyone help someone to misrepresent himself so he can achieve his dreams ? Vincent is helped by Jerome ( genetically superior being ) , Irene ( his love interest ) , and a doctor ( who tests urine samples ) . Even Vincent 's nemsis ( Anton ) finally gets out of his way once he understands the power of Vincent 's heart and determination . I believe people help Vincent because , in the end , no one really cares what advantages one is born with . We care far more about the human side of individuals . Vincent is someone we all can admire , and his positive qualities ca n't be bought or predetermined with genetic disposition . When we encounter such individuals , we are sometimes even willing to sacrifice our self-interest for them.This films hits all cylinders , including all the emotions ( love , betrayal , desire to win , hope , jealousy ) . I cried in couple of moving scenes . In my humble opinion , this film 's greatness will be appreciated and validated with the passage of time .	1
One of the most overlooked and under rated films ever made , I wonder why this gem was so easily overlooked . With deep undertones of perfection and philosophy of self this film went beyond the barriers of movie entertainment . A script always makes a movie and what a delighful script.screenplay this is ! ! witty and perfect enough to carry the plot , Andrew Niccol has done an amazing job with this film . The clinical production design and color layerings which form the atmosphere give it such an edge that it trule speaks in a lot of different forms.The acting here is superb and top notch and here we see a less popular at the time lesser known Jude Law who shows us his talent and what he 's capable of . A warning of a film with deeply beautiful sincerity to it , this ranks up there .	1
Uma Thurmond 's character surprised me on a couple of occasions , which was a nice touch . Great story ; well written ; well acted ; poignant and slightly scary all at once . You do n't have to be a sci fi fan to enjoy this one .	1
Anton is a man that is sure to rise to the top . The problem is he is n't who they think he is . In a world controlled by genetics only the elite can succeed . One man decides he will achieve his dreams even if he has to lie to do it . He meets a woman who is in a similar situation . The fall in love , but have they fallen in love with a lie . Will the achieve their dreams together , or will they be cast out of society and never find happiness.This movie is an amazing amazing drama . Ethan Hawke , Uma Thurman , and Jude Law play amazing roles . This is a very tense , emotional , and touching movie . It is one of those that really inspires you to do your best . The production quality is great , the story is original , the dialogue , is incredible , and the emotions overflow . Gattaca is an unforgettable movie . You ca n't miss it .	1
I must admit that this movie did not appeal to me when it was first released in theaters . However , many years ago , I rented it and was captivated by the story . Since then I 've had to make do with the underwhelming DVD edition . If you are looking for a lot of action , then this movie is probably not for you . What it does offer is a fantastic story with a cast that gives top notch performances . If you already own the DVD , and are not sure if this one is worth the upgrade , believe me the Blu-ray edition blows the old DVD out of the water . The sound and picture are near perfection . The colors on the DVD version appear washed out compared to the high def color palette . While this movie wo n't give your surround system a major workout , it does provide very clear ambient surround effects . The special features include two new short documentaries on the making of the film . While these do n't compare to some of the extras offered on other titles , they are very informative and a welcome addition to the previous version . My one fault would be that it would have been great to have at least a good commentary track , or even a picture in picture feature . But , because I feared that this movie would never get the treatment it so rightly deserves , I would still highly suggest you add this title to your Blu-ray collection .	1
I 'm not a person who 's into all those & quot ; robot & quot ; & quot ; sci fi & quot ; movies but I decided to watch this movie with a friend . I love this movie . I own it and think it 's just great . The story , the actors , the world they have to live in , all fascinating . Just recommended by me is all I have to say ;	1
This movie reminded me most of Aldous Huxley 's famous novel : Brave New World . This book is about how your genes make you what you are in life.The same happens in this movie . Ethan Hawke is born a degenerate , someone born only through his parents without any interference . His brother however was 'crafted ' . He has a heart condition which should have killed him but he is still alive . His dream is to get into space and he therefore takes on the identity of someone who is capable of going into space but is crippled . Through DNA tricks he tries to but gets involved in a murder scandal.The movie has no special effects and does not need them . It 's a murder mystery in the not too distant future . As mentioned before the book Brave New World comes to mind but also the movie 'AI ' in its cleverness and 'Blade Runner ' in it 's artistic sense , even a little 'Brazil'.Do n't expect CGI 's or fancy SF stuff but a good story .	1
I loved Gattaca from the day I first saw in theaters . I was very excited to see it 's release announced for blu-ray , and now am happy to say that this blu-ray release is truly an upgrade . If you 've already bought this on DVD , it 's worth buying again on blu-ray.Video quality is top notch in every single scene . This movie has a subtle color palate that casts a warm orange hue in day scenes , and a cool blue hue in darker shots . Some people may complain that this type of cinematography is overly processed , but regardless of what your feelingss are on the look of the film , you ca n't argue with this blu-rays amazing image quality . I ca n't stress this enough , the movie just looks perfect.Special features are as bad as they were on the DVD release , including a handful of scenes and a brief documentary . The documentary is rather interesting , although most of the material discussed is common knowledge by now . Sadly the bonus content did n't get the HD treatment , understandable since the documentary was shot on video and the deleted scenes never made it past dailies . Oh yeah , watching the deleted scenes is painful , so just skip those ... trust me.What else is there to say , it 's perfect .	1
I can see why people like this film . It 's a look at the future , filled with high-tech gadgetryand slim physiques and stylish suits . The whole thing is about one 's looks . But it 's alsoa rather complicated sci-fi murder mystery , and after a while I could n't follow it . Ofcourse , in a film that is all about the look of things , you can simply watch instead oflisten , but , to tell the truth , I did n't even know what & # 34 ; Gattaca & # 34 ; refers to . I think it 's theplace where they all work -- and guess who 's their boss : Gore Vidal ! That 's sneakycasting . I 'll give the movie this much -- there 's nothing else like it . But every now andthen it sort of reminded me of that old silent film The Crowd .	1
In the not too distant future , a young man , Vincent Freeman ( Ethan Hawke ) , dreams of escaping from Earth and rocketing into outer space . But Vincent is genetically flawed -- he 's got a bum heart and a life expectancy of just 30 years -- in a world where such human frailty is no longer the norm and no one 's about to waste precious resources on an astronaut with less than an optimal genetic profile . In order to get around his all too human limitations , Vincent swaps genetic profiles with Jerome Morrow , ( Jude Law ) , a genetically-designed and nearly perfect young man , embittered by the accident that left him wheelchair bound.The achievement of bio-engineered superiority for some has naturally created a bifurcated society , with the elite gripped by paranoia about inferior `` degenerates '' trying to pass themselves off , so Vincent 's deception requires him to sneak Jerome 's urine into sample cups , to wear false fingertips with Jerome 's blood for identification pinpricks , even to salt his workstation with Jerome 's hair and skin flakes . Even with all that he still has to deal with the suspicions of an arrogant launch Director ( Gore Vidal ) , a watchful staff physician , and a beautiful fellow trainee ( Uma Thurman ) . The situation becomes even more fraught with danger when a murder occurs at Gattaca and two cops begin to haunt the place.All of this works well enough as a mere sci-fi thriller but writer/director Andrew Niccol , who also wrote The Truman Show , is after far bigger fish . What he gives us here is a timely and thought-provoking argument against the idea that genetics is destiny . Just as he showed Truman 's seemingly perfect world to be anti-human , he shows here that the utopian quest for physical `` perfection '' , because it can not account for the human soul , must result in a dystopic nightmare . A few of the really fine touches here are the set designs which are cold and sterile ; the general absence of women , who will be selected out in a world where fathers can always choose to have sons ; Vincent 's birth scene , when his own father , realizing him to be an `` unsatisfactory '' heir , decides not to name the boy for himself ; and what is , I think , the best scene in the film , when the genetically perfect Jerome reveals that he envies Vincent 's natural birthright , the unengineered will that drives him.This is a profound film . It sounds a too seldom heard cautionary note about the limitations of science , even as it celebrates the limitless human spirit . At one point the Director says : `` No one exceeds their potential . If they do it just means we did n't judge it accurately in the first place . '' This notion , that human potential is a physical quality , to be quantified , measured and judged , is the all too likely and frighteningly imminent horror that resides at the core of this vile future world . Mr. Niccol is a polemicist of a very rare sort , for he manages to entertain even as he delivers his jeremiads . That 's quite a feat . It makes him one of the most exciting and visionary talents to come along in Hollywood in some time.GRADE : A	1
First off , if you have not seen this movie , I highly recommend it . Each shot is a visual masterpiece and it is a very original story . The cinematography , acting and directing are perfect . A perfectly genetically engineered film.The quality of the Blu-ray is amazing and could not look any better . The little featurettes and documentaries are pretty cool , but the main treat is the movie itself . And with Amazons price of $ 20 , it is an offer you ca n't pass up . Very much worth replacing your good old fashioned DVD with . Highly recommended .	1
Is n't it wild when a movie seems to have the same idea you 've had for years ? Look at parents in the world today . What competitive advantage will any parentdeny their child ? What disadvantage will any parent willfully inflict on theirchild ? Now imagine that every parent has the power to choose which part of their genesare passed along at conception . How many people would walk away from that power ? How many people would choose less than the best for their child ? Gattaca is a blueprint for how genetic engineering could spread like wildfirethroughout a society.What is more powerful in a society than parenthood ? Government perhaps ? Consider the health care situation today . Is it sustainable ? Now consider howto change it . There is an old idea called `` the hoof and mouth cure . '' It goeslike this : '' If there are no hooves , and there are no mouths , then there is nohoof-and-mouth disease . `` Would any government pass up the opportunity to eliminate health care problemsat conception ? Imagine what could be done with the billions , the trillions , ofdollars saved.This is just the starting premise for Gattaca . I do n't like to write spoilers , so let me just say that the above `` Utopia '' has all the flaws we 'd expect fromour own experience . There are no perfect people in this movie , not even close.Neither are the science nor the government perfect : they 're just groups ofimperfect people.Beyond that , Gattaca is a great example of a `` science fiction '' movie where thescience , and the special effects , dwindle into the background . This is not amega-budget CGE movie . Its a people movie.Again , consider the degree of competitiveness today . Now imagine a world whereevery person has the full power of reproductive science backing their individualgoals.A more level playing field means that the small errors become more critical.More focus is required . More self-monitoring . Less subconscious or impulsivecommunication . Actions , even insults , must be limited to serve the person'sstrategic goals . People have to be at their best , all the time . Social failureis as fatal as work failure.That 's where the acting comes in . All the actors here are a part of this newworld , this new way of socializing and competing . There are no weak links inthe acting in this movie . The audience is left wondering about every character.What is going thru this person 's mind ? These characters are all fully developedindividuals , and their words and actions , no matter how eloquent or direct , areonly part of that individual . The level of detail and nuance in the acting hereis deep.Gattaca is one of the most thoughful movies I 've ever seen.Its high degree of competence echos and underscores its basic story , in apowerful and unsettling way . Can any of this be avoided ?	1
A great movie for a night with my sci-fi loving partner . The science was lacking , but hey , it 's a movie .	1
This movie is about the promise of modern genetics , both passive , reading one 's identity from a sample , and active , in changing the physical character of a person-to-be.In this dystopian world , genetic determinism has taken over every aspect of life . Babies are built to order , with soothing assurances from the practitioners that it 's really quite natural . A job interview consists of a cell sample - anyone with all the right strengths is in . That excludes people with any molecular flaw , including Vincent.The movie acknowledges that the genes make the man ( or woman ) , but points out that it takes a lot more than just genes . Jerome , one of the genetic elite , is physically and spirtually crippled by accident . His golden genes do n't do him a lot of good . Vincent has the flaws we would call `` the human condition , '' unacceptable in his world , but personal drive and determination to overcome almost any obstacle . In an elaborate ruse , Vincent presents Jerome 's genetic identity as his qualification to enter the highest echelons of achievement . He excels , because of his drive , but that is taken for granted because of `` his '' genes.Uma Thurman appears in a prim , starchy role , with a pinstripe business suit and hair in a severe bun . Jude Law plays the grating , spoiled Jerome , showing again that there 's more to a man than the meat he 's made from . Ethan Hawke does a good job as Vincent , always a moment from discovery and from being stripped of that world 's highest rewards . This is n't an action movie , no guns or chases , but good suspense.It 's also a reminder that , whatever good the new biomed technologies bring , there is danger , too . It is one role of science fiction , to explore the possibilities without actually incurring the human cost , and this movie does a fine job.//wiredweird	1
Destined to be a cult classic U turn has to be the finest 'non conformist ' movie of recent years . Panned in some critical circles no doubt thanks at least partly to Oliver Stone 's high profile , due for a fall persona , U turn is a warts and all no holds bar trawl through the dark underbelly of the American psyche . Stone and the writer Ridley take great pleasure in subverting just about every movie cliche you could think of in true Shakespearean style . The ensemble acting is masterly , Nolte coming across as a combination of Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden with a pair of knashers ( his own I think ) Bugs Bunny would be proud of . Thornton hams it up hilariously . Lopez , Danes , Phoenix , Boothe , Voight all deliver in spades . Holding it all together Penn 's performance is faultless . Stand out scene must go to the old lady literally blowing 'Bobbie Cooper 's ' lifeline into smithereens . Coupled with the classic Morricone score and you have an AIP lover driven into rapture .	1
I 'm not a big fan of Oliver Stone but this movie was awesome ! Sean Penn does a great job of portraying the lowlife and is always believable . He could have carried this film on his own but he has a great supporting cast along with him ! The scenes involving the disgusting mechanic played by BillyBob I could watch over and over again ! Jennifer Lopez is sizzling as the seductive young housewife looking for a way out.There are some unsettling scenes which might repulse some but nothing too over the top . The quick-cut style of filmaking and overacting that made Natural Born Killers so annoying is toned down and really works in this film . Nothing much in the way of extras on the DVD unfortunately but this movie does n't need any . It 's over two hours of action , thrills and fun ! ! ! Do n't miss ! ! !	1
This is the fourth time in four years that I 've been watching Oliver Stone 's U TURN . I admit it sincerely , I did n't like it so much the first times but I kept watching it because there was something in the movie that attracted me . And I know by now that any quality movie deserves more than a single showing if you want to express an objective opinion about it.There is much to discuss about U TURN 's content , arty effects or characters . The movie can also be the beginning of hour long discussions on the homages and the references , evident or more subtle , distillated by Oliver Stone along the road . Take the final scene , for instance . Watch it again with the final scene of King Vidor 's DUEL IN THE SUN in mind . The Sean Penn-Jennifer Lopez bloody show takes a totally different dimension , does n't it ? So one of the reasons of the cult status gained by a peculiar movie is the pleasure the movie creates with each new vision . Like a classical music opus , the film must never make you feel as if you had digested its entire substance . You must feel unsatisfied , ready for a next showing right after the end credits . With U TURN , you 'll be sure to possess a DVD that will outlive the most sophisticated DVD players.A DVD zone & quot ; they do n't like it but I do & quot ; .	1
Sean Penn plays a small time crook , trying to make it to heaven with somebody else 's cash in his backpack . Heaven I guess would be someplace where you can live in saftey and spend that money you stole . But he is on the road to hell and there 's no u turn . He 's had to fingers plugged off by hedge clippers and the rest of the hand waiting for its turn if he gets caught by some Vegas thugs . His car breaks down somewhere in Hell and things go from bad to worse . The film is somewhat plot driven . The characters have to go with the plot which is sad , because these are marvolous characters and actors . Stone 's film tech is great and he makes a graphic visual display , but the plot is somewhat small and weak . Lopez plays the vixen who is beyond twisted after surviving what seems to be a horrific life . Borderline behavior to the max , no trust is branded on her forehead . Penn just keeps bouncing up after being delivered through worse and worse scenarios of bad luck , as I said plot driven characters . Oh well , the acting and the direction push this up to a 4 star , overall its worth viewing because it is so wigged out.Lisa Nary	1
Anyone who doubts Jennifer Lopez 's acting abilities , as I once had , needs to see this movie . In this movie , she shifts from seductive and manipulating to vulnerable and desperate and back again with surprising ease . Jennifer Lopez can be a good actress when she is n't stuck in a bad movie.And now to the rest of the film . U Turn treads on familiar territory of the mysterious drifter Bobby ( Sean Penn ) who , on his way to pay his debt to some kind of mob boss , finds himself stranded in a creepy desert town . He quickly becomes enraptured with the town sex object Grace ( Lopez ) whose husband ( Nolte ) catches them together . But instead of getting mad , Grace 's husband asks Bobby to kill her so that he can cash in on her life insurance . When Bobby is robbed at a convenience store , he is left without the money he owes to the mob , so he takes up the offer to kill Grace . Thus begins a very complicated and violent series of events.My only complaints are the underused characters of the wild-child town Lolita ( Claire Danes ) and her very short-tempered boyfriend ( Joaquin Phoenix ) . It is kind of funny , though , to see Joaquin Phoenix basically dressed like Johnny Cash in a scene where `` Ring of Fire '' is played in the background.U Turn also treads on a lot of the same metaphorical territory as Stone 's Natural Born Killers -- the desert , dead animals , prophetic Native Americans , etc . In this way it sometimes feels like a rehash of Natural Born Killers ; and if I had n't seen that movie , I 'd probably like U Turn even more . But the story is gripping enough and the performances are intense enough that the movie is definitely worth watching .	1
I 've seen Sean Penn in a few films now and they 're all good . Oliver Stone is one of the finest men in film production . It 's visually stunning , loads of mad camera pans and colour blast-outs ! Jennifer Lopez is attractive an alluring who had sex with Nick Nolte who played her father . Sean Penn car breaks down in the middle of the desert he has to get this money to a bunch of bad guys or else he 's dead they already cut off two of his fingers .	1
7 Years in Tibet is about a German-Austrian Mountain Climber - Heinrich Harrer 's spiritual journey and his meeting with the young Dali Lama during his journey.Although I am not a big fan of Brad Pitt , I thought he did an excellent acting job as the character Heinrich Harrer , who many of us can identify and relate to - The goal oriented and egoistic person who life brought him down to his knees feeling separated and isolated in the foreign country - Tibet ( to not spoil the story , I will let you watch the movie to figure out what happen to this character ) . I am also happy the main character Heinrich Harrer was acted by Brad Pitt because he is a famous movie star ( that makes many others want to watch the movie and be aware of the issue Tibet has suffered ) .After I watched the movie , I also went on a google search to see a biography of Heinrich Harrer . I was surprised on how the costume and the make-up of the movie of the main characters match what I saw on the internet . It shows that the movie must have been made with great care of details to match the culture , the history and the times.I love the story of this movie ( and probably will buy the book to read some day ) because it is different from the standard `` love story '' comedies or the violent victory movies portraying some heroes out there saving the world . The movie is made from a true story about Heinrich Harrer 's friendship with the young Dali Lama and how the wisdom from Dali Lama helped Heinrich Harrer to grow spiritually as a human being ( you have to watch the movie to experience this inspiration ) .As a Chinese , I am ashamed of what the Chinese Government at the time did to Tibetans , yet I have no right to vote against their behavior and violence . I am ashamed of what the Chinese Government has done still today about not freeing Tibet , yet , I do not have a right to vote of a government that listens to my voice . My own parents suffered from separation , despair and sorrow from the same Chinese Government during Chinese Cultural revolution in the 60s . Therefore , even though I am not a Tibetan , I can understand what Tibetans must have been through - physical and emotional torture from this unconscious , egoistic entity.I am writing this review to let others know that not all Chinese out there are ruthless and insensitive about this issue . I care about this issue and one could only hope the nation of Tibet can find its political freedom some day . Maybe political freedom will come later . However , may I humbly ask for healing , forgiveness Tibetans have suffered all these years because resentment , hatred , if any , can only poison ourselves further and these poison can be passed on to many more generations . All I can say is if I were ever a Chinese Government official , I would have been one/want to be one who can stand up representing the Chinese Government to say , `` I apologize for what my government has done . Human beings are all one . Let us show respect , compassion , integrity just like the way the Tibetan culture have shown us - Compassion , non-violence , peace . '' May that time come soon as the global consciousness is awakening of itself.Thank you for reading my review .	1
Makes you reconsider life and the way you are living it . Gives insight into the ways others choose to live .	1
Like all old films , first released on DVD a few years ago and now re-released on blu-ray , the key question is , how good is the high definition transfer ? Well in this case , I am pleased to say that it is indeed very good . The colours , image sharpness and the general detail is much better than the old DVD . The sound is much better too , being uncompressed.The film itself is great . A true story , well presented , well filmed and very moving . Having been to Tibet , I found the scenery and the monuments shown , like the Potala , very convincing . The film is a precious rare testament to the world , of Chinese aggression in occupied Tibet , that one can only realise after a visit there . A tragedy to which most political powers in the world have since turned a blind eye . Highly recommended .	1
For some their incapacity to see what is in front of their eyes drive them away for reality until reality stand in their path and give them no option .	1
Was not all that impressed with Brad Pitt as a performer till I watched this film . Now I am . Great film .	1
Very good movie , tells the recent history of Tibet , the story of the Dali Lama and how he made friends with the Austrian climber who made it to Lahsa in the early 40 's . It tells the story of how Communist China troops took over Tibet in the early 50 's and destroyed villages and killed ordinary people and Buddhist monks.Highly recommended .	1
This movie is one of the best thrillers I 've seen.If you like very smart and intense thrillers , then you should check this one out , but if you only like thrillers that are much more understandable , then you should check PHONE BOOTH .	1
That 's the kind of movie I like . Great actors , action , suspense and some food for the mind.The director , Christian DUGUAY , made this & quot ; B & quot ; sci-fi movie SCREAMERS which was already terrific . Here , in THE ASSIGNMENT , he mixes real facts , the terrorist actions of Carlos , and a complex plot of the C.I.A . in order to eliminate him . And the mixture works ! And there is the final scene in a lake which deserves to stay in movie history.A DVD to discover . You wo n't regret it .	1

doug [ nicolas cage ] is an fbi agent assigned to guard tess [ shirley mclaine ] a widowed , former first lady . he is a rules and regulations guy with no spontaniety , she is a free spirit with little tolerance for the fbi 's button-down world . prior to being assigned to tess , doug worked under her husband , the president . one day while watching videotape of her husband 's funeral , tess sees doug become emotional , a rare opportunity to see him vulnerable . it 's obvious they have more in common than at first glance . doug is tested later and comes to realize he cares for her very much . great movie , with a lot of heart and humanity .	1
I just watched the second half of Guarding Tess on TBS . It 's now 11:30PM , and I am writing this review when I should be in bed 1 and half hour ago . Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances . The story was lightly funny at first , but did n't really go anywhere . The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange , and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation , it was still weird . The climax came at the end , and was very entertaining , for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot . There is much meaning in the movie ; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life . I was touched by the movie . Thank you . I should go to bed now .	1
Shirley MacLaine is a pistol in this movie . A definite matriarch . I love the underlying story for Nicholas Cage becoming her body guard . Really Good Movie .	1
have n't seen it yet , it 's a birthday gift ... .so glad you had it ... thank you , thank you , thank you . I 'm happy	1
This is a movie which is both good and funny about a man who clones himself because his job is costing him his time with his wife . Needless to say the experiment goes overboard . Anything else I could say could and would be a spoiler so all Ill say now is you should get it .	1
I found this flick at a second-hand DVD store for $ 3.00 . My expectation level was low and it far exceeded them . This movie is a piece with other comic fantasies from director Harold Ramis , `` Groundhog Day '' and to a lesser degree the remake of `` Bedazzled '' . Ramis mines most of the comic possibilities out of the possibilities of cloning oneself , plus or minus . The film is anchored by a superb performance by Michael Keaton that recalls his best work in `` Beetlejuice '' and the `` Batman '' films . Not classic but well worth your while . On a trivial note Keaton 's character is named Doug Kinney probably out of homage to one of Ramis ' collaborators on the `` Animal House '' script who prematurely passed some years ago .	1
This buisness is just booming . Doug Kenny , a struggling contractor with a family , has his problems just like every other human being . Daily problems , little problems , big problems . It 's just so hard to get set in life . . .until he meets with a geneticist after he publicly loses it.Michael Keaton plays a perfect quadrouple role . First he clones one for his work becuase he has some serious catching up to do , then he makes a clone for home life , then the two clones make a clone from the second clone . Things could n't be better.The only problem is that `` TWO '' has turned into your stereotypical macho guy , `` THREE '' becomes the Martha Stewart side of doug , and the fourth clone is all screwed up , bouncing off the walls like he 's a child.The special effects here were really ahead of their time but being able to place one actor in a scene several times over is positively seamless.It 's the perfect comedy for anyone who ever wished that they could be everywhere at once .	1
One of my favorite movies as a kid . Funny and family oriented . Great for people of all ages to watch .	1
I loved Michael Keaton in this movie.. In a interview with Michael Keaton , he said this was the most difficult movie he has made . He plays four parts through the whole movie . When you watch the movie you will see what I mean . He did a great job . Would recommend this movie .	1
This is a screamingly funny movie . It 's not on the Olympian level of Groundhog Day , but still , another win for Harold Ramis . I pity the people who found it trite and unfunny ; a person is rich in proportion to the number of things he can enjoy . Some of the clone jokes may be a trifle obvious , but Michael Keaton makes them work in his usual inimitable fashion . Andie Macdowell is perfect as the wife ; who would n't have trouble obeying Rule Number One with her around ? The big disappointment is , it 's not available in wide-screen format . No matter how hard you pan-and-scan , you just ca n't fit four Michael Keatons side by side into 1.33:1 .	1
This is the funniest Michael Keaton movie I have ever seen . It 's a very clever , entertaining comedy . My teen age grandson laughed until tears came to his eyes . He said , `` I 've never heard of this movie . '' I found that many people have n't . I do n't know why it was n't promoted more . It involves cloning - big time . Each clone is a personality split from the original plus a copy of a copy does n't turn out too well . Michael Keaton plays all the parts , ( mostly anyway ) . The whole family can watch this one although little ones probably wo n't understand it too much . I 'd recommend it for age 12 and over .	1
This is easily one of the best comedies that I have ever seen . Harold Ramis is a comedic genius , and his directing here shows . Keaton is brilliant in his four roles , with Number 4 being my favorite by far . 'Nice party , Steve '	1
Or how many ? This hilarious movie does nothing to answer that question.The premise is goofy . Doug is burning the candle at both ends and looking for more ends to burn . There just are n't enough hours in the day for one man to be contractor , father , husband , provider , and swigger of beer at the hockey game . So Doug dives straight to the core of the problem : that thing about `` one man . '' When the chance arises , he clones himself so there can be more Doug to go around . But that Doug does n't like the hard hours any better , so there 's a third . And a fourth ... The plot is silly and formulaic . Good , just formulaic . The real treat in this movie is Michael Keaton . If you look at his movie roles ( Batman , Mr . Mom , Beetle Juice , etc , etc ) , he 's never the same twice . He 's all over the place . This is his movie . He 's there four times , playing one character four ways , with four very different personalities . They move differently , talk differently , inflect differently - the four Keatons really are different . Fer cryin ' out loud , Doug4 does n't even look like Keaton most of the time , but is . This is n't a piece of cinematic art so much as a place for the many Keatons to play together , off the leash.It 's good , silly , date-movie fun . It 's kid-safe . It 's shallow and forgettable . But it 's physical humor and fast-change personality gags at their best . If that 's what you want , it 's howling funny.//wiredweird	1
Released in 1993 , Bruce Willis ' & # 34 ; Striking Distance & # 34 ; has a bad reputation . Roger Ebert tore it to pieces , basically saying it was too derivative and by-the-numbers , and Willis himself said he hated it . After finally seeing it I can understand criticism to a point . The story has a very melodramatic comic-book vibe , which is obvious in the opening act , almost like a TV production except with a superior cast and action scenes . But -- and this is an important but -- I quickly found myself drawn into the story & the characters and greatly enjoyed the Pittsburgh locations , the ( melo ) drama and the thrills . In other words , the movie IS entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.The story revolves around Tom Hardy ( Willis ) , a Pittsburgh detective , who 's demoted to police river rescue . A serial killer returns after a two-year absence and bodies of beautiful women start turning up in the river , all women whom Hardy used to date ! Sarah Jessica Parker is on hand as Hardy 's partner on the river.This is a cop thriller in the manner of the Dirty Harry series , except more comic booky and taking place in Pittsburgh rather than San Francisco . It 's also reminiscent of films like & # 34 ; The General 's Daughter. & # 34 ; Although not technically as good as the Dirty Harry movies or & # 34 ; The General 's Daughter & # 34 ; due to the cartooniness , & # 34 ; Striking Distance & # 34 ; nevertheless pulled me into the lives of the characters and gave the requisite thrills . As such , I feel it 's at least as good as some of the lesser Dirty Harry films.The generically-named & # 34 ; Striking Distance & # 34 ; was originally called & # 34 ; Three Rivers & # 34 ; -- a much better title simply because it 's more specific -- but was changed at the last minute because the marketing department feared people would think it was a sports movie due to Three Rivers Stadium , so they switched it to & # 34 ; Striking Distance. & # 34 ; Why ? The first hint is at the beginning of the move when the title card shows two electrical bolts coming out from either side of the title . Later we observe the mysterious killer using a stun gun before killing his victims and , with a stun gun , you must of course be within ... striking distance ! Speaking of the killer , one element of the plot I have n't mentioned is that this a whodunit . Someone is charged with being the killer early on but Hardy knows it 's the wrong guy ; in fact , he and others are sure it 's a cop or ex-cop doing the killings . There are a few suspects , including Hardy himself , but -- I 'll be honest with you -- I was unable to guess the right person . There 's another twist late in the story that also took me by surprise.The bottom line is that & # 34 ; Striking Distance & # 34 ; is a cop thriller that effectively entertains and entertainment is the name of the game . Plus it was shot in Pittsburgh , a refreshing change.The film runs 102 minutes.GRADE : B	1
This movie is pretty typical in many ways but Bruce Willis delivers an outstanding performance in just about every single movie he is in and this is another in a long line.Former big city cop banished to being just a river rat there is more at stake than finding his fathers killer when women from his past keep winding up dead in the river for him to find.Sarah Jessica Parker also delivers an excellent performance that was very surprising.This is a must own for Bruce Willis fans and fans of the 80's/90 's thriller/action movies .	1
I love Bruce Willis in all of his action movies , but , this time , the enemy is family . A must see film , even seeing Sara Jessica Parker in spandex adds to the film . For fans , this is a must have to add to their collection .	1
`` Striking Distance '' is one of Bruce Willis ' very best cop movies . In this picture he plays a 5th generation Pittsburgh cop who is demoted to water patrol ( or as Tom Hardy calls it in the movie `` water dog '' ) after initiating an investigation into police brutality . I enjoyed this movie very much because Bruce was thrilling and exciting and the entire story is very fast-paced with many twists and turns . `` Striking Distance '' is both an action movie as well as a high-impact thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end . This is the ultimate game of cat and mouse but as any Bruce Willis fan knows very well , this man does n't play well with others . I ca n't tell you what happens but I can tell you that if you enjoyed Bruce Willis before you will like him even more after you watch this .	1
This is one of my favorite movies , of course Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors , and all of his movies are good , but thanks to Amazon that finding these old movies has been great , I have enjoyed everything i ever purchased from Amazon , and have been able to find almost everything that i wanted on Amazon Thanks , so much , buteercup @ yahoo.com	1
Robert Downey Jr is a great comedic actor and he shines in this movie ! Just so much fun and lots of laughs ! I love the romantic comedies with him . His very best is Heart and Souls ! !	1
I have purchased this movie in multiple formats and now I have added it to my DVD collection . This is a timeless classic . My wife loves this one .	1
This movie is silly and funny and an excellent representation of the weird things that were going with films in the 80s . What even were 80s movies ? Also oh my gosh tiny Alyson Hannigan and even tinier Seth Green were adorable !	1
This movie is pure fun . My whole family loved it . It 's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it 's amatuer hour , but its fun to watch . We made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing . Watch it and enjoy !	1
Not sure how well this movie did all in all , but I 've always thought it was good since I saw it in the theater when I was a kid . My opinion is either you like it or you do n't .	1
Dear D. Ullery : I would like to add a fifth film to your favorites ... And since you like Dan Aykroyd so much I trust you 'll appreciate the suggestion of adding `` Doctor Detroit '' to make it a Fab Five ! Being a big fan of the ORIGINAL first years of SNL Comedy ( when it was actually funny ! ) my friends and I were drawn to Doctor Detroit when it first escaped into the world . Of course , if you are also a Johhny Fever fan ( WKRP in Cincinnati ) you no doubt had to love Howard Hesseman as well , and fortunately he is in the film as well ... Along with 3 lovely `` Women of the Evening '' -- Fran Dresher , Donna Dixon and Lydia Lei -- ( pun intended ! ) , mostly unknown at that time . Once again we see Dan playing a very straight man ( college professor ) forced into a position of being charged as the one needed to save the college from takeover by using subterfuge to obtain a grant . The best advice I have is SEE IT -- RENT IT -- or just plunk down $ 7 -to- $ 9 to buy it -- You 'll like it ! ( It is rated `` R '' for strong language ... )	1
This was a great find . The price was the best I & # 8217 ; ve found.It does exactly what I was looking for it to do .	1
Rod Serling died almost 30 years ago . He thought he would not be remembered . Lord ! How he is so remembered and how he and his work are still beloved . It is great that his theatrical film of & quot ; Requiem for a Heavyweight & quot ; is finally out on DVD . His script is beautifully directed by Ralph Nelson . There 's a lovely score that is perfectly blended as well.The DVD looks freshly minted . It is one of his finest works . Acted by the best , who seem to live the roles , not portray them . Anthony Quinn as Mountain Rivera , the shambling man of the broken eyes and voice and heart , face massively scarred , is a towering testament to the ability of man to survive at the saddest , most desperate level . He is loyal to his manager Maish ( Jackie Gleason ; again showing what a good serious actor he was ) , to the extent of letting Maish & quot ; sell his soul on the streetcorner. & quot ; Maish is not a thoroughly bad man -- he stood beside Mountain at times , but & quot ; when winning does n't pay , losing does. & quot ; You can see the cast reveling in Rod 's words . It 's a movie about integrity and friendship and giving everything away because you owe something to someone that you really do n't owe at all . It 's about having values and standards . The real kind that are n't hollow words . People talk in this film . They communicate . You have to listen to the words . You did back then . It was called writing and acting . Rod was one of the best . Still is.In the print used for this DVD , one particular scene is cut . It is after Maish gets Mountain drunk . Army , the cut man , ( an equally superb Mickey Rooney , of the compassion and the heart ) said to Maish , & quot ; this is not a side of beef you can job off on the market by the pound ; cause if you do , Maish , if you do , you 'll rot in hell. & quot ; Powerful dialogue -- not one liners , insights instead ; some of which were on the print ads when the film was first released.Julie Harris is luminous as the social worker who finds there are facets of a man 's worth that ca n't be put in a box on a form . She wants to help ; and tries so hard . The great character actors , Herbie Faye and Stanley Adams are nice to see again . In a & quot ; sport & quot ; such as this , Rod finds humanity . He showed us shards of life and he delivered them with such strong stirring words that have lived in my mind from childhood on . They are places where I hide and find sustenance.Rod is gone . His work lives on . That way , the giants still loom . As he often wrote , & quot ; it is to weep. & quot ; Indeed .	1
`` Requiem for a Heavyweight '' is a number one contender for the best movie concerning the `` sweet science '' that I have ever seen , along with Scorsese 's `` Raging Bull '' . Trademark Rod Serling , this powerful little film ( originally made for TV ) is a remorseless and scathing indictment of a society that worships force while it flourishes and edges toward the top , then is quick to jeer when it falls to the inexorable canvas of nature.Anthony Quinn gives a gut wrenching performance as the quirky , sensitive and slightly punch-drunk Mountain Rivera , an aging prizefighter who falls at the hands of a young Muhammad Ali ( still Cassius Clay at the time this film was made ) at the beginning of the film and suffers a detached retina . From the opening scene to the last , `` Requiem '' is determined to give the viewer a bitter taste of what it meant to be a boxer when mafia thugs controlled the sport and fighters were chewed up and spat out with all the grace and empathy of an ugly car accident . Here Quinn transcends even his portrayal as Zampano the Australian strongman in Fellini 's `` La Strada '' .The forces that control Rivera 's destiny are pitiless ( his manager Maish , played by Jackie Gleason , is a self-divided man occasionally showing signs of real tenderness toward Rivera but ultimately interested in saving his own neck ) and only one other man in this whole tragic story seems to understand his plight -- a young Mickey Rooney , turning in an Oscar worthy performance as his trainer Army , a former fighter turned cut-man who despises Maish for his cruel manipulation of Mountain 's almost childlike loyalty to him for his own purposes . Unfortunately , Army does n't have much say in what happens and only has the guts to stand up to Maish in spurts , his resignation getting the better of him as he carts the old pug from employment agency to employment agency , trying to make him understand that the world is no longer his oyster and has n't been for quite awhile.Rivera 's abrupt and somewhat unrealistic relationship with social worker Grace Miller played by Julie Harris ( `` The Haunting '' ) , is possibly the only real spark of hope in Rivera 's doomed life . I do n't see where Mountain could n't have become a camp counselor or something to that effect : he does not seem so incapacitated or punch-drunk that this would be an impossibility . Maish , with the mob breathing down his neck for the money he lost betting against his own fighter , makes sure that this does n't happen , getting him drunk on the night of his appointment with yet another famous guest star of boxing lore , the huge Jack Dempsey.Each scene of this film is an excruciating exercise in degradation , but somehow we feel compelled to watch . You almost hate Serling for getting us to identify so strongly with this tough but very innocent shell of a man , and then throwing him into a pressure cooker he is neither smart enough nor mature enough to even glimpse a way out of . That is real talent.The ending is perhaps the strongest part of the film and is achingly honest . When faced with the decision to pursue his own dubious prospects in life or save his manager 's skin -- by extension sacrificing every value he has lived by his entire ugly , violent life -- the decision is inevitable . An unforgettable , heart rending artistic accomplishment and more evidence that Serling could have been much more than the creator of that groundbreaking television series `` The Twilight Zone '' .	1
Perhaps Rod Serling 's greatest gift as a writer was his ability to take the reader or viewer into a world unknown to them and make them feel comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time . Comfortable in understanding that world by the details Serling provides but appalled by the inner motivations that rule there . In Requiem for a Heavyweight he takes a harsh look at the unforgiving world of professional boxing.Anthony Quinn is a fading heavyweight who gets beaten senseless by Cassius Clay in the opening sequence . Jackie Gleason is his manager and Mickey Rooney his trainer and cut man who tries to help both inner and outer wounds heal . Julie Harris is a social worker who goes the extra mile to help Quinn after he is forced to quit the ring due to injuries.Serling slowly weaves the quartet 's fears , hopes , dreams , and desires into an interplay of emotions that explodes at just the right moments . Lurking in the background are a female gambler and unscrupulous wrestling promoter waiting to take a piece of the action any way possible.The last sequence in which one of the four loses his friends , another his self-respect out of loyalty to the one who betrayed him , and a third his faith in his fellow man is among the best in cinema history .	1
This 1962 adaptation of an Emmy-winning Playhouse 90 production and adapted by Rod Serling from his original 1956 television drama , is a heavy hitter . It 's about a fighter , brilliantly played by Anthony Quinn who , after a 17-year career in the ring , has to resign because of a medical condition . He 's never done anything else but fight and now tries to find a job . A sympathetic employment counselor , played by Julie Harris , tries to get him a job in a summer camp . His manager , played by Jackie Gleason , however , owes money to the mob and wants him to work in staged wrestling matches , much to the displeasure of his trainer , Mickey Rooney . The screenplay is totally real and immediately drew me into the story ; the outcome is inevitable.Each one of the cast members does an outstanding job , especially Anthony Quinn . His face is battered , his voice thick and he 's slow and punchy . I could almost see his thinking process , with just an extra second or two for anything to register . I identified with this man who never did make champion and who was now just 37 years old and at the end of his career . Jackie Gleason was the perfect unscrupulous manager and I hated him throughout , but also saw his humanity and real fear as the mob came after him . Mickey Rooney as the good-hearted trainer was wonderful too and he and Gleason had some great scenes together . Gleason is large and Rooney is small ; this added yet another element to the film . Julie Harris keeps her dignity throughout and there is a scene in a bar between her and Anthony Quinn that I will always remember . To top off this star-studded cast , there is a scene with the real Mohamed Ali , then Cassius Clay , in the opening segment of the film . And , later , Jack Dempsey makes a short appearance.There 's an authenticity to it all and real emotion and done so well that for a little while I lived in the world of the fight game . It 's not pleasant , nor was it meant to be . But this is a fine filmmaking even though this film won no awards or nominations . Highly recommended . See it if you can .	1
This is a very old classic and I purchased it for an avid fan of old movies . He was very pleased with it and will be wanting more in the future .	1
what do you do ? This boxer clearly was n't good at much of anything else . Now a doctor has made the decision to shut him down . His manager Jackie Gleason is obviously not financially prepared for this news . He had the best lines in the film and was incapable of turning in anything less than an excellent performance at this point in his career . The other roles are also sad and effective .	1
This is a golden oldie if there ever was one . Adapted from Rod Serling 's earlier `` Playhouse 90 '' TV drama , it improved greatly on the original by taking full advantage of the film medium , including moody film-noir lighting , an excellent music score , and superb direction . Anthony Quinn is excellent , getting all the pathos out of the role without overdoing it . Mickey Rooney and Jackie Gleason , neither of whom is renowned for subtlety and restraint , hit just the right note in their performances , as does Julie Harris . The ending of this film could n't be more different than the `` Playhouse 90 '' ending . One of the more bizarre elements of this film , which was not in the original TV play , is the character of Ma Greeney , a really frightening person and the only example I am aware of in film of a lesbian gangster ( and in 1962 , yet ) . I can still remember how startled I was to see this character when I first watched this film on TV back in the late 1960s.The new DVD of `` Requiem for a Heavyweight '' offers both a full-screen and wide-screen presentation . The quality of the transfer is really outstanding . The liner notes indicate that it is mastered in high definition . While I do n't have the hardware to watch it in high-def. , I can say that on an ordinary monitor it looks outstanding . Perhaps the sharpest DVD picture I 've ever seen . The sound is clear , and the subtitles are very helpful in picking out dialog that may be indistinct , or not easily understood because of Anthony Quinn 's manner of delivering the lines while in character.However ... It seems to me that at least one whole scene and a part of another scene is missing . I distinctly remember Maish ( Jackie Gleason ) telling Ma Greeney what he would do to her if she were n't a lady . In response , she laughs and says `` that 's the nicest thing anyone 's ever said to me . '' This is part of the early scene where Maish is attacked in an abandoned boxing ring by Ma 's thugs . There is another whole scene I can recall in which Mountain ( Anthony Quinn ) is practicing holds with a wrestler . He asks that the wrestler stay away from his injured eye , and when he purposely goes for the eye , Mountain punches his lights out . The cuts I recall seeing on TV years ago always included these scenes , and I 've never seen this shortened cut of the film before . It 's still a great film , but I really miss these two scenes . I would have given it five stars had it not been a shortened cut .	1
i highly recommend this film for it 's stunning locations , beautiful cast and wonderful theme song.anyone who loves films from this era and can appreciate the atmosphere will not be disappointed .	1
A lot of people want to say that this movie is a pathetic waste of time , and I 'll admit that I used to say the same thing . But the thing was , I 'd keep on watching it because it was fun to make fun of it ! The movie includes cheesy lines , not perfect acting , and scenes that are plain out silly . But at the same time , it makes you have a great time just watching it . It 's the guiltiest pleasure ever , just like the songs are . This movie has so many different scenes to it that are great fun watching , and some of them make you laugh out loud . Even if you want to laugh and make fun of it , you should really see it . Overall , it 's fun and entertaining , and it 's also worth watching .	1
I bought this for my sister for Christmas . We loved the Spice Girls in elementary school and we had this on VHS when we taped it off the TV . So great to have it on DVD , I just need to buy one for myself !	1
This is just a great romp for anyone who enjoys the Spice Girls . It 's silly and funny and the music is pure Spice gold .	1
The Spice Girls ( the original group , back when Ginger was still a Spice Girl ) at their very best ! ! The is a great , whacky , humorously campy look at the Spice Girls ; a self-satire . The girls poke fun at themselves and the whole world of pop music ! It 's the Spice Girls first big concert . The girls are nervous enough as it is , without having to deal with the pitfalls of the music world ; a newspaper editor who hates them ; a photographer who appears from out of nowhere ; and a slave-driver of a manager.Will the Spice Girls first show be a success ? will they break up ? A comedy full of fun , music and Spice	1
Considered now by many as a cult classic , & quot ; Spice World , & quot ; marks the feature-film debut of Britain 's most famous band since the Beatles . Directed by television veteran Bob Spiers ( & quot ; Ab Fab & quot ; ) , the movie focuses on the girls during a few days in their hectic life , as they prepare for their big gig at Royal Albet Hall in London.The movie 's camp factor helps in boosting the film 's appeal with teenagers and pop-culture fans , and although the acting is not that great , the film gives us many hilarious scenarios including a Mission Impossible-based fantasy called & quot ; Spice Force 5 , & quot ; and an enjoyable photo shoot where the girls imitate major pop icons of the past and themselves.The songs from the band 's first two albums provide the film 's soundtrack with a diverse selection of tunes that keeps the film together . I only wished that producers released a compilation album of the band 's songs that were remixed for this film ( & quot ; Who do You Think You Are & quot ; sounds wicked in a techno beat ) .The film 's other highlight includes multiple cameo appearances by such personalities as Sir Elton John , Bob Geldof , Meatloaf , Bob Hoskins , Roger Moore , George Wendt , and one of the actress from the & quot ; Ab Fab & quot ; series . All give wonderful comic performances.The film 's worst scene involves the girls ' encounter with aliens during a midnight hike in the woods . Personally , this scene seems out-of-place in such a film . Richard E. Grant is great as the girls ' manager , and the film 's subplot of a tabloid thrasher going after the girls makes it much more fun to watch.Reminiscent of a & quot ; Hard Day 's Night , & quot ; Spice World will garner more new fans throughout the year as the film is aired on television and at midnight-movie festivals . If you want a fun , fun movie , wthen this is it !	1
Spice Girls ' second one is pure pop album . The great opener `` Spice Up Your Life '' cheers you up whenever you are down and sad . `` Stop '' and `` Move Over '' are classic pop songs too ... MO is the one we remember as a Pepsi song . `` Viva Forever '' and `` Too Much '' are peaceful song ... they are in my opinion the best ballads that any girl group has done ... so deal with it ... '' Do It '' is the one with power ... just like `` Satuday Night Divas '' ... '' Never Give Up on the Good Times '' is the one that is a happy song too ... very optimistic . `` The Lady ... '' is a great song . It is very old-fashioned music ... I guess in 60 's or 50 's was this kind of music . So , Spiceworld is a great girl power album.Stars : Spice Up Your Life , Stop , Viva Forever	1
I love this movie . Always have right now I do not have a DVD , player but I will still buy my fave 's ... . Great movie !	1
Many Hollywood celebs have said in interviews that comedy and drama lies close together , this movie is definately the proof of that.Baseball is not the national sport here in the Netherlands , and many Dutch people do n't even know the rules of the game.Although I know the rules , I was n't exactly planning to watch this movie because I 'm not so interested in this sport.However , since I 'm a huge moviefan , I was willing to give this one at least a chance , because I like other Penny Marshall movies like AWAKENINGS , BIG , RENAISSANCE MAN , and I for one think that Penny is a great director.I was n't sorry at all to watch this movie , and I really was touched by it.I 've seen it over 20 times , and I still enjoy it.There is superb acting by Tom Hanks , Geena Davis , Madonna and Rosie O'Donell . Not to be missed Jon Lovitz with great jokes.I was laughing my rear end off when I saw the look on Jon Lovitz ' face when the ugly man-like girl had a try-out.But that 's one of many times that I had to laugh with this great comedy.And what I think makes the movie very strong is that one moment you 're laughing very loud , and the next you want to cry , especially when Tom Hanks graps the bad-news-telegram from the postman , and walks towards one of the girls with the bad news . And they all know what the telegram says.That 's a very good scene , and wonderfully edited.What also was great is the black & white ; news about the baseball stars changing to color to characters in this movie . It was more like an objective view changing to a subjective view ; well done like this , very creative ! ! The photography is magnificent , and the soundtrack ( Madonna 's this used to be my playground ) really touches you , especially with the older characters in the picture during that music.The characters have depth because of Penny 's attention to detail ; for instance the ugly girl 's father explains that she 's so man-like because he raised her as a boy . And his confession makes you feel sorry for this girl , instead of judging her like Jon Lovitz for her looks ( another change of feelings ) .Tom Hanks is also great as the coach , and Penny changes your feelings for him also during the movie ; first you hate him , than you love him . Way to go Penny for making a magnificent emotional comedy-drama , which did n't get the credit ( here in the Netherlands ) it deserves ! ! ! A must see for everyone ! ! ! After all , who does n't like to laugh ; and these jokes make everybody laugh ! And above that it 's a great experience when a movie plays ( in a positive way ) with your feelings like this one ; and believe me -after seeing lots of movies of all kind of genres- movies that touch you are very rare.The story being of baseball does n't make this an Americana movie , but a movie non-Americans can enjoy as well , so for the non-Americans this is also a must see ! ! !	1
This movie is the perfect chick flick , if we might even attempt to taint it with that moniker . If not every rugged female wants to drive her convertible over a cliff a la 'Thelma and Louise ' to prove her gumption and independence , then she should pick up a baseball and fire a strike . There 's something about being empowered by baseball and playing it just as hard and tough as the boys -- much less facetious than the usual wimpy challenges women face in chick flicks . Having played fast-pitch softball competitively for the last 15 years , there 's a dugout somewhere in my heart for this movie .	1
Very Good ! I really hate the way Amazon has a demand on how many I should use to review a product - What a bunch of horse pucky ! ! !	1
Finally ! A baseball film that guys & amp ; grils will BOTH like ! This could pass for a touching family film , a sport movie , or a hilarious comedy . Featuring memorable performances by Tom Hanks , Gina Davis , and Madonna this funny film has a little something for everyone . Gina plays an awesome hitter , and you have to see Madonna run ! The film is especially funny when Stu ball angel & quot ; comes along . One of the funniest moments is when the girls are on a bus , and Stu is running around , and nearly kills them because he puts his hands on the drivers eyes . Madonna gets up , gets a bat , and says & quot ; I 'm sorry , but I 'm going to have to kill your son ! & quot ; and chases him . A memorable baseball film that you 'll love ! The story centers on Dotti ( Gina Davis ) and Kit ( Laura Petti ) Henson . Both are sited by a scout , and are asked to join an all womans baseball league headed by a chocolate bar king ( Gary Mashall ) . There , they meet Mae Mortibito & quot ; All the way Mae & quot ; ( Madonna ) , Doris ( Rosie O'Donnell ) , and the other Rockford Peaches . The girl are headed by a drunk manager named Jimmy Dugan ( Tom Hanks ) . The girls go through several personal problems , but still manage to put up quite a fight on the field . But , trouble starts when & quot ; the chocolate bar king & quot ; threatens to shut down the league next season.Overall Grade : A+ ( 10+++ )	1
MADONNA ! ! Rosie O'Donnell ! ! Tom Hanks & Geena Davis . Does it get any better than this ? `` A League Of Their Own '' is the true-story of the `` All-American Girls Baseball League . '' The movie is directed by `` Laverne & Shirly '' star , Penny Marshall . There are so many funny lines in this movie ( `` there 's no crying in baseball ... '' ) This is a great movie that your entire family will enjoy !	1
Wow what a great movie ! The actors in it are wonderful Tom Hanks , Madonna , Rosie O'Donnel what more could you ask for people ? This movie really shows what women can do , very inspiring ! I love the part when they poison the chaparone person and they sneak off to go dancing ! I thought it was funny : ) . Its a really good movie especially for women !	1
A little too sentimental for its own good , `` A League of Their Own '' comes up just shy of a homerun.The bittersweet comedy is the true story of 1943 's all-woman baseball league , put together to satisfy baseball fans while the male players went to war.Geena Davis , Lori Petty and Madonna star as the women determined to prove their mettle and disprove the popular belief that & quot ; girls & quot ; ca n't play the game . Tom Hanks co-stars as their lovable , perpetually drunk coach , and Jon Lovitz appears in a scene-stealing cameo.The film more or less follows the pattern of most sports films , setting up the conflict that will eventually pit sister against sister in the climactic championship game.It 's testament to director Penny Marshall that the film mostly manages to rise above the clich & eacute ; d storyline , at least until the awkward epilogue , which forces emotion instead of letting it unfold , and reduces its characters to caricatures.A League of Their Own is n't quite in a league of its own , but it 's pretty close .	1
There 's no crying in baseball just like there 's no crying when you buy this classic . That 's all I 've got to say about that .	1
A HEARTWARMING STORY ABOUT A GIRLS BASEBALL TEAM , SET UP FOR ENTERTAINMENT WHILST THE WAR WAS ON.IT LOOKS THROUGH THE EYES OF TWO SISTERS , ONE PRETTY , CLEVER AND TALENTED AND THE OTHER TRYING TO SUCCEED WHERE HER SISTER DOES.THEY JOIN THE BASEBALL TEAM , AND IN DOING SO FIND A DIFFERENT LIFE.ALL STAR CAST INCLUDING , GEENA DAVIS , LORI PETTY , TOM HANKS , MADONNA AND ROSIE O DONNELA FEEL GOOD MOVIE FOR ALL TO WATCH	1
For anyone who has seen this movie and loves it , the deleted scenes will help explain some of the events that left you wondering how you got to certain things . I will just tell you of one deleted scene so as not to ruin your viewing them . Carla is riding on the train and they are in the dining car . Need I say more . LOL Lovitz is at his best . Should have left it in the movie . Enjoy	1
Excellent Blu Ray Quality in an older movie . Great Price on AMAZON . A movie that you will actually want to watch more than once .	1
I really liked this movie . It was filmed in my home town at that time . Evansville , Indiana . A must watch .	1
Fantastic movie with lots of heart and comedy ! Tom Hanks is awesome as are all the actors/actresses in this film.A good chick flick that guys can enjoy too !	1
I have always loved this movie . It 's funny , exciting and I have always enjoyed a good baseball movie . It shows that women can do whatever men can do and at times even better . Made me cry at times , laugh a lot and smile at the memories	1
Do n't eat it ! There 's no Crying in Baseball ! Classic lines from a classic Tom Hanks movie . If you can take Gina Davis 's huge annoying mouth , you will LOVE this movie that highlights even folks like Madonna ( who does a great job , by the way )	1
Its about team of women during war time that become baseball players . Tom Hanks did a wonderful job at acting like a drunk . He was so funny in this movie . These women go through a lot to become great players . They 're funny in this movie . This movie is one that you 'll watch over and over .	1
I 've watched this movie a long time ago , however my 10 year old watched it recently and wow ! She really got interested in the movie . Funny and heart-felt ideas evoked questions out of her . Excellent movie-she just did n't like some of the kissing ! Lol	1
Not only is this a tremendously entertaining film , it 's an empowering piece of women 's history in sports . I bought it for my daughter because I think it 's a must-see for all girls that play sports ( of any variety ) . The obstacles that were overcome by these women in the 40s paved the way for later leagues such as the WNBA , WUSA , and WAFL.But -- all that aside -- this is a funny , touching film . Penny Marshall does n't exactly do subtle emotions , so have the Kleenex handy . I dare you not to cry during the war-department telegram scene . Everybody , even Madonna , seems just about perfect in her role . I only wish that there had been more included on the DVD , maybe some of the behind-the-scenes stuff that I usually skip on other DVDs -- it would have been interesting here.Oh , look sharp during the & quot ; Meet the Peaches & quot ; scene , where the girls take the field for the first time to the hoots & amp ; derision of the crowd . You can see Rosie do a face plant just as she turns to run to third base . Do n't know why they did n't reshoot the scene , but there it is : - )	1
One of our favorite movies . Another Tom Hanks hit ! All of the actors are perfectedfilled in their roles . A fun movie to hold your attention .	1
this is a rare story from steven king about every day kids on a mission to try to find a dead kid before the bullies find him . the reason why i say rare is there is no magic no demonic souls just life . this is a great one to watch maybe some can relate to them in a way .	1
Hey Its Sunnydale Chick here ... ... .I just got this movie like last month , saw it when I was a kid ... .LOVED it since I was a kid ... and I LOVE this cool cover . I got the autograph 2 but funny thing is , it 's not from this movie ... .No complaints , I just wanted to say if you order that it 's from Friday The 13th ( he 's not wearing the glasses at all , and I had it checked ... ..it 's from that movie ... ..I just wanted to say that because I know Corey Feldman s movies SO well , I 've seen Every one of them since I was 8 ... ..he 's my FAVORITE actor and is just SO COOL ! I saw this one when I was a kid ( like I said ) and he was my FAVORITE character in the movie . Besides Kiefer Sutherland ( Who as in interesting fact I found out on the net last Summer ... ..Met Corey then , and THAT 'S how we got Lost Boys . I love how Corey 's The Bad Boy telling weird stories in the movie ... ..and I read this Short story Last Summer ( I wish that it was a novel though . ) Now I saw Friday The 13th after I saw Scream ... ... . ( cause I had to know this background story ; but I DID N'T actually know Corey was in this one till I saw him in the flick ... ..It was a nice surprise though and I REALLY like how the characters are SO similar . AND that 's something else that 's REALLY cool about Lost Boys 1 thru 3 you get to see Edgars character develop thru out the years ... ... the others ... ..not so much ( although I DO like Allen as a Vampire ... ..and the background scenes That were references 2 the 1st movie ( this is in The Thirst ) And the respectful references that they had to Corey Haim in the movie , I thought that was descent .	1
I rented this film from my 12-year-old grandson thinking he would love it . Nostalgia can look at four boys in the 50s . Sadly , the language is also nostalgic . I do n't know why I did n't remember that the F bomb drops every 13 seconds . Not suitable for children at all ! My bad !	1
`` Stand By Me '' is a must and own for everyone ! Its a great tale of friendship . From the first time I saw this movie when I was young , until now , its always been one of my favorites ! If you havent seen it by some chance , watch it , youll love it !	1
This is one of my favorites to watch , all them young actors and they did such a great job in their roles . Very much an enjoyable watch .	1
A really good movie , encourage all to watch it . Certainly a throw back . Conversations between the kids is something that we can relate .	1
Liked it when I saw it years ago when I lived back east ! ! ! ! Loved it this viewing now that I live in Oregon just miles away from it 's filming location , Brownsville , Oregon . Great coming of age movie ! !	1
This is one of my all time favorite movies and has been since I was a little girl . I bought this DVD so I could have both the DVD and VHS and I still watch it often . This movie is amazing , timeless , and never gets old . Many can relate to the relationships between the four 12 year old main characters of the film . In addition , I have an obsession with River Phoenix ( Chris Chambers ) so that never hurts .	1
Make no mistake , this is a sad story with four kids who have home problems and are misfits who all band together to make their own in-group . The acting in such young people is superb , most notably by the late , great River Phoenix . It pulls at the heartstrings at times , and can also enrage you at other times . There are also laughs included , but it 's a serious piece with all the poignancy that you 'd expect from Rob Reiner , a director 's director . I recommend this highly , but I would not suggest it for anyone under the age of 14 . I know-the kids who are the actors are probably under 14 , but that 's the business of their parents and one hopes that they do not all go out as did River Phoenix . Wil Wheaton seems to have made it . Get this film because you wo n't be disappointed .	1
4.5 stars . This is easily one of my favorite films from my teenage years . For many reasons , this film resonates with emotional nostalgia for any man who remembers their early pre-teen years , before the magic of youth began to fade with experience . That 's what this film captures : the magic of being a young boy . It really does n't matter that it 's set in a different era , the nature of boys will always remain the same . One of those universal traits came under critical fire when this movie was first released . It had to do with the amount of profanity that all the main characters use . I staunchly defended the dialogue , to this day for that matter , knowing full well that when boys are alone together they are more likely to rebel against talking conventionally . Be it cursing or whatever , there is a sense of unbridled freedom when no authority figures are present to reprimand your behavior . The four lead child actors here are all excellent . Director Rob Reiner is , at least in this film , a genuine miracle worker . It is a rare film that has this many child actors with this much talent and intelligence conveying what it 's like to be a kid at heart . At no time did I think they were acting beyond their years , like so many other child actors fall victim to doing . There is plenty of wit and good old-fashioned toilet humor , which is the flavor of the day with young boys ; but there are also some authentic , emotional moments in the story , as well . This is a fine film that shines with great performances , charming direction from Rob Reiner , and a thoughtful story from the novella & quot ; The Body & quot ; by Stephen King . One last note concerning this DVD : there is an especially poignant featurette on the making of this movie with a final ode to the late River Phoenix . He was the James Dean of my generation , and he is greatly missed . This film is just a small part of his short legacy , and provides ample proof that he would have been one of the greatest actors ever . R.I.P .	1
My gosh this BR edition is fabulous , it looks beautiful , it really does . The special features are nice as well , the documentary about the film with the interviews really puts you into the mindset of how they got the performances and how much this film means to them as well as us , since this is such a nice experience to watch a well-crafted , touching film like this . Well worth it .	1
This movie has always been one of my favorites . Growing up I loved it , and I still love it now . I use ( d ) it for my students in a classroom to show them the various ways of writing beginnings ... .and how it does n't have to be boring .	1
Love the movie , buyt it ! Its a must have specially if you have kids , since in my experience is a childhood memory ! A happy one !	1
if you have ever had a friend and you and that friend did something crazy you should check this movie out . this movie is quality friendship film . i recommend this good movie to 99 % of you .	1
This just about as close to my growing up as it can be.Tho we never went to see a body we did do some crazy thing 's growing-up.An adventure for the boy's.Enjoy	1
This film was recommended to me 5 years ago and I had fully intended watching it , but never got round to it . However , having seen the video for 'Stand by Me ' on the Vault , I was drawn to the movie for the entirely shallow reason that the song was good and it had clips of the film attached ! Of course the problem , at this point , is that films which you expect to be good frequently disappoint . ( You need only think ofThe Matrix ReloadedorStar Wars I - The Phantom Menaceto know that feeling ... ) Fortunately , this film DID live up to the long wait ! It had all the wondrous writing of Stephen King , a non-cheesy , uplifting plot and sensational characters who were really engaging . It is plain , and easy to see why River Phoenix has the cult status he does , and also why this film is upheld as a seminal coming-of-age film.Of course , there are weaknesses , as the 2 star reviewer states . The weakness I 'd highlight is Stephen King 's incredibly annoying habit of putting himself in a story . Gordie would have been a far better character , if it were n't for his untouchable nature . This also means that he has the only part that has a happy ending ( not to plot spoil ) , which is a little indulgent.However I would rate this film still , even with this minor weakness . And I would salute it for the fact that it avoids the cliche of many films of having a eponymous title song , which is then shamelessly used throughout ( e.g . inAn Officer And A Gentleman ) . This film saves 'Stand by Me ' ( the song ) for the titles at the end , and so quadruples its power ( and makes you remember it for days after ! ) So , if you have this film at # 3894 on your wishlist and are wondering whether it is worth seeing , then learn my lesson - it is and should be seen as a priority over all other films . Watch it , and find satisfaction at the end of longing ...	1
Yes , & quot ; Stand By Me & quot ; is a very good movie . I am only 14 , so I ca n't say that it brings me back memories of my childhood . But this is still a great movie . It 's about four 12-year-old boys who go on a 30-mile hike in search of a dead body . The boys cuss , smoke , tell tall tales , and stick together as a team . Let 's just say that things get a little dicey , however , when the knife-wielding hoods of the town begin to follow the boys . This movie is very funny ( I ca n't stop laughing after the pie-eating contest , even if it was a little ribald ) , but it 's also a touching story about friendship , too . All in all , this is a wonderful movie. & quot ; Stand By Me & quot ; , however , is rated R. In general terms , it is rated R for plenty of inappropriate , rude , and vulgar behavior . These include crude language ( e.g . & quot ; Why do n't you go home and ... . your mother some more ? ! & quot ; ) , smoking , offensive humor , and perilous situations , all of which involve 12-year-old kids . This is why I rated it 4 stars . I highly recommend it for fathers and no-less-than-14-year-old sons . I would n't want to put any crazy ideas into the minds of any younger kids .	1
`` Stand by Me '' , based on Stephen King 's novella `` The Body '' , is one of those movies that I never tire of watching . Set in the Pacific northwest in the late 50 's , four boys ( Will Wheaton , River Phoenix , Corey Feldman , Jerry O'Donnell ) go on a search for the body of a dead classmate . Their adventures and trials on the journey are multilayered and can be enjoyed on many levels . The photography is stunning . The dialogue is crisp and funny . Well written , well acted , and beautifully told . There are no wasted scenes so pay attention from the openning shot . A young Keifer Sutherland is great as a teenage hood . Richard Dreyfuss does a cameo and narration . I show this movie to my middle school students and they love it . The `` R '' rating is for vulgarity . Pretty tame stuff by today 's standards . I LOVE THIS MOVIE ! ! ! !	1
Many times in my life I 've felt on the verge of an adventure . Many times I have n't followed through , but when I have the world has opened up to a new understanding . That 's what I think about when I think of this movie . A coming of age tale of stretching the view of the world and the lessons that are part of a growing understanding . Any person that has tried to stretch their wings and move out into an unknown opportunity or future can identify with the feelings such a choice encompasses . The moving story combined with a beautiful song are a hard combination to top .	1
`` Stand By Me '' is a classic coming of age movie about growing up and friendship and the pain of disillusionment when the adults you depend upon let you down . Highly recommended.In this review I 'll focus mostly on the relationship between the movie and the Stephen King novella it is based on , and the DVD extra material that closes the ring.The movie `` Stand By Me '' was made in 1986 . It is based on a novella published in 1982 and the story takes place in 1959 ( movie ) or 1960 ( novella ) . But the story is timeless - the conflicts and the difficult transition from child to adult apply to every generation.There is a lot of trivia ( pop songs , slang expressions , TV shows , etc . ) from 1959/1960 in the movie and the novella , but this does n't really anchor the story to that era . Every generation has it 's own trivia that is very important to that generation . But today 's generation can smile at the trivia of 47 years ago and still see the parallels between that trivia and their ( to them ) much more wonderful trivia.The movie is based on a novella by Stephen King called `` The Body '' . This is one of Stephen King 's best stories , and is well worth reading or , if you like audio books , listening to . The audio version lasts almost six hours and is read by Frank Muller . Highly recommended . If you 'd prefer to read the story yourself then you should buy the book `` Different Seasons '' , a collection of four Stephen King novellas including `` The Body '' .The movie and the novella are very similar . There are , of course , many small differences , for example the town of Castle Rock has been moved from Maine to Oregon , there is more coverage of the older juvenile delinquents and less coverage of Gordie 's stories and of Gordie as an adult , the place where the bloodsuckers are encountered is different , etc. , etc . The biggest difference is that in the novella Chris is the main protagonist , or hero if you like , while in the movie it is Gordie . Still , this movie is truer to the written source than most movies based on books are.So why did Rob Reiner make these changes , and what on earth did Stephen King think of them ? Here 's where the magic of DVD extra material comes in . The `` Special Edition '' ( 2000 ) and `` Deluxe Edition '' ( 2005 ) DVDs both include a 35-minute documentary `` featurette '' called `` Walking the Tracks : The Summer of Stand By Me '' , which was made in 2000 . Stephen King , Rob Reiner and all of the major actors in the movie ( except River Phoenix , who died in 1993 ) participate.In this documentary film Rob Reiner tells that he identified personally more with Gordie than Chris , and therefore decided to make the movie Gordie 's story . And Stephen King says that he respected Rob Reiner 's decision and thinks that `` Stand By Me '' was the first movie adaptation of his work that really fulfilled the spirit of the story.Stephen King also says that many of the things that happen in `` The Body '' and in `` Stand By Me '' are things he experienced himself in his childhood . This makes the story somewhat autobiographical , with Gordie being in some ways the young Stephen King . In the novella `` The Body '' this is quite pronounced in that an adult Gordie is telling the story in the first person , and also tells how he 's now become a successful writer of horror books.So the bottom line is , if you like the movie then read or listen to the novella . And after you 've read the novella and seen the movie , check out the DVD featurette that ties them together.Rennie Petersen	1
Rob Reiner is really one of our great directors . Recently , he has made some , well , to be kind , not so good films . But ( along with WHMS ) this man gave us Stand By Me . I thank him and other for putting together this special DVD.When this movie came out in 1986 , I was the same age as the boys in the film . I was excited to see it when my parents rented it and for some reason I 'll never forget this : I was grounded the night my parents were to watch it . I was banished to my room ( where I listened to the oldies station ironically ) . I was sad , but moved on to summer camp and life ... I rented some time later and liked it . Then , for some stupid reason , I forgot about the movie.It was n't until the holiday season and with my new DVD player keeping me warm , that I decided to revisit this classic . Watching it ( and the commentary and the really touching documentary -- much better than the usual junk they slap together ) touched me very deeply . This film contains moments from your life . It will move you . It captures so perfectly exactly what that time is like . It is a treasure . I ca n't think of many other movies or TV shows ( except the Wonder Years ) that really gets what it is like to be a kid of that age . There are no super smart kids here . There are stupid adults . Just real emotion . It takes it place among my favorite works . A real and true masterpiece . I thank Stephen King , Rob Reiner , Richard Dreyfuss , for their honesty , pain , and truth . .	1
Richard Dreyfuss narrates the film as he writes the story of an adventure that took place in his childhood with some characters he 'll never forget.In the innocent 50 's , Gordie ( played masterfully by Wil Wheaton ) is the lonely , unwanted brother of a beloved son who has died ( John Cusack ) . His father is cold and unloving and the family constantly recalls the dead young man that could do no wrong , while neglecting the son that they have in their midsts ... preventing Gordie from being able to mourn the brother he looked up to and misses dearly.A group of local teenage thugs with names like & quot ; Ace & quot ; ( Kiefer Sutherland ) and & quot ; Eyeball & quot ; are switch-blade wielding punks who happen upon the body of a mentally challenged boy who has been missing for a few days . As they make plans to return to the site to recover the body for a reward , Eyeball 's younger brother ( the late River Phoenix ) and friend of Gordie 's overhears the details.Gordie and 3 of his closest pals embark on an adventure to recover the body before the thugs do and have experiences that change their lives in the process . The story is far less about the body , and far more about the relationships the boys have with their fathers and each other.They camp out in the middle of woods during their adventure and tell stories and share their hearts with one another . Sometimes tender , sometimes drop dead funny , the story will give you a glimpse into the tender side of boys they rarely feel comfortable in sharing in our culture . Deep , caring guys who have been supressing their self-doubts , fears and anger and sometimes manifesting the emotions in humor , delinquent behavior or just overeating.The acting is superb and you feel less like you 're watching a film and more like you 're one of these guys , joining them on their adventure.It 's amazing to see the chubby little Jerry O'Connell who grew up to be the buff chick-magnet on & quot ; Sliders & quot ; and bittersweet to see the late River Phoenix in his screen debut at a time in his life when there were no drinking binges or illicit drugs.The film is rich , tender and bittersweet . The soundtrack is also a definite keeper . I highly recommend it .	1
Back in my junior year of college ( circa 1982 ) I read a story called The Body by Stephen King that really touched me ; I really could relate to the story and the characters.In The Body there 's a preteen click of friends very similar to the band of mischief makers that I hung out with in my preteen years ( circa 1972 ) . To pass the time , they/we walked the local railroad tracks . They/we smoked cigarettes . They/we got bullied by the neighborhood bullies . They/we did traditional preteen stuff.One day , one of the band of buddies overhears his older brother ( a local hoodlum/bully ) telling the story of his knowledge of the whereabouts of a dead body . Upon relaying this intrusion to the rest of the click , they all set out on a journey down the tracks to see the body . And ultimately the journey is chock full of events that will stay in the memories of the group forever.So when I heard about 4 years after reading the novella ( circa 1986 ) that Rob Reiner would do a film adaptation of The Body I just knew that it would n't ... just could n't ... do justice to the book . What film adaptation ever does ? Well , Stand By Me does ( incidentally , so does Misery ; you might say that Reiner is the king of King adaptations ) .Stand By Me was terrific . It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact . And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella , so there 's some pretty interesting stuff ( you can count on King to wow you with precise tales of growing up as a baby boomer that include plenty of thrills ... and when he does n't thrill you he goes for the gross-out ! ) .Importantly , the movie really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King 's novella . The Body was a moving , realistic portrayal of a day in the life of some young kids in a small town ; Stand By Me is The Body come to life.And kudos to the key young actors ( Sutherland , Wheaton , O'Connell , Phoenix and Feldman ) for exact incarnations of the characters in King 's story , kudos to Reiner for his direction and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains , but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today ... the world of growing up in the 50s , 60s and 70s.Stand By Me is a collector 's item . Add it to your cart .	1
This movie gets better each time u watch it . It is a rare gem ! The story of four young boys going a trip of their lifetime is so unforgettable . All of the boys realize something important in their life through the adventure . This is a great film about coming of age and friendship ; it has great music , cinematography , and , most important , acting . River Phoenix is radiant in this picture ; never has a young boy actor give such a memorable and moving performance . I have watched this film many times , and my eyes got wet every time the credit rolls and & quot ; Stand by Me & quot ; plays . Three cheers for this great film !	1
We 've all been there . It 's summertime , when you 're with a few , great friends and wan na go on a big adventure . Well , that 's what `` Stand By Me '' is about ; a brilliant mix of laugh-out-loud humor and introspective moments of awe , it 's a movie that never wears thin.The overall plot is that four boys , from ages twelve to thirteen , hear of a dead body and go searching overnight for it . There 's plenty of summer adventure in it , big laughs among friends , and that feeling of living in the wild , if only for about forty-eight hours . And then , there 's that feeling of change that , for at least one point in our life , we get nervous about . That necessity of holding onto friends even as you get separated from there . It puts you in such a state , as it 's displayed in such an honest , realistic way that it captivates you all the way through.What impresses me a lot about `` Stand By Me '' is how it just seems to carry on at full speed . There never seems to be a dull moment and by the time it 's over , you may feel astonished that it 's already done with . Like with a lot of other , great movies , this one has many , sub-situations the four guys get themselves into , and if it 's not enough that they 're racing a gang of older guys and outrun a junkyard dog , need I say more than such things as `` campfire stories '' or `` a lake of leeches '' ? *shudders*Without revealing the resolution , the ending shows the adult Gordie , who has been narrating the whole thing . The ending is very powerful and moving , and as the credits roll , the '61 song `` Stand By Me '' plays.This is an excellent summer movie that goes by quickly , but leaves such an impression on you that you 'll remember and love it forever . But through all the drama and action , it 's a definite work of art that 's sure to please anyone who sees it .	1
I ca n't pass this movie by if it 's on cable or regular TV , and I 'm glad I was able to watch it streaming on Amazon .	1
Movie is one of the classics . The acting is one of the best . You know I love it more than my luggage . With lines like that who can not watch this movie and smile and then cry around the next turn . This is not only a must watch but a must own .	1
A goodie/oldie movie . A sad but lovely story , One of my top faves ! ! ! ! ! ! Amazing movie . Great cast , too . I have always loved this one .	1
I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it for the first time in the theatre . Each of the actors portrayed in this move did a superb job . I have added this movie to my movie collection !	1
This movie has endured as a classic from the day it was first released and could n't have been more perfectly cast . MacLaine and Dukakis are priceless ! I 've seen this movie so many times that each actors lines are committed to memory , yet I watch it again and again .	1
have seen it a million times , but it is always a treat to watch . this is a look into the lives of a few women who are friends in the same southern town . the cast is awesome , so is the dialogue . this will both make you laugh and cry several times . there are a few hard scenes towards the end , but the movie ends in a way that makes you feel good .	1
Tear Jerker ! Sally Field never fails to deliver a phenomenal performance ! The cast of actors worked well together . The movie left you wanting more .	1
This is a good movie for women . It stirs every emotion . The friendships between these women are inspiring . I 've watched it a few times over the years and have enjoyed it every time .	1
I remember that when `` Steel Magnolias '' first came out it was highly acclaimed and Academy Award talk was heard everywhere , but I never saw the movie . Thus it was that my wife and I were browsing the low price DVD rack and happened to stumble upon it . Always enjoying a good late-night movie , we picked it up and watched it last night . It was excellent . `` Steel Magnolias '' is built around the lives and friendships of six women in the Bayou country of Louisiana . It 's a beautiful setting and the filming is excellent . The story unfolds at a glacial pace and you gradually feel that you are a part of the women 's lives . Then a slowly developing crisis overtakes two of the women and , of course , involves everyone else deeply . Be sure you have a handkerchief or two within east reach as it becomes a very sad movie . And then resolution and life goes on . Parts of the movie are light and funny , but then the story draws you into deep sorrow . My wife thought it was very depressing . Me , I rolled with it with only the loss of a few tears now and then . In any case , the acting was excellent and was rewarded with a number of Academy Award nominations . It 's a very well-worth-watching movie.Gary Peterson	1
Academy award Winners Sally Field , Dolly Parton , Shirley Maclaine , Julia Roberts , Olympia Dukaksis and Daryl Hannah star as southern women dealing with Diaylsis and life 's situation's.Parton won the People Choice Award Best Actress.Roberts Won the Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe , lost the Oscar.All the ladies have Oscar 's and Nominations except Hannah.Parton steals the movie as Truvy	1
every time this movie was on television i would watch it and when i heard Queen Latifah was going to do a remake i was excited until i actually saw it . Needless to say the original is way better , and shows more emotion ; really the funniest actress in this movie is Shirley MacLaine .	1
Never fails ... as many times that I have watched this movie , I always cry at some point . The friendship these ladies share and the southern ambiance is great !	1
At the moment I can think of no other film featuring four academy award winning actresses , and Darryl Hannah and Dolly Parton hold up well in this ensemble featuring Oscar-winners Julia Roberts , Sally Field , Olympia Dukakis and Shirley Maclaine.Steel Magnolias is an artifice - a fictional Southern Universe where all the women are strong and funny and compassionate and lovable despite their flaws . It 's the kind of fictional universe where the characters are named M'Lynn , Truvy , Ouiser ( pronounced `` Wheezer '' ) , Annelle , Clairee and Shelby . In my extensive travels in the south I have met one Shelby , and no real people with these other names . I also have not met a Drum , Spud or Jackson . But the writing , which is funny from the opening wedding to the final funeral , is crisp and delivered with relish by the above-mentioned crew.Now , part of the artifice in the film is that men are little more than accessories to the lives of our starring six women . The script , by Robert Harling from his script , gives us only a spattering of men who are all a good bit dumber , less caring , less compassionate and more boring than the women . Tom Skerrit , Sam Shepard and Dylan McDermot play the husbands of Field , Parton and Roberts respectively , but the screenplay makes them all disposable.At the center of the story are Sally Field 's M'Lynn , who is mother to Julia Roberts ' Shelby , who is marrying Jackson . Everyone gets their hair done at Truvy 's ( played by Dolly ) , but the chief currency at the beauty parlor is gossip , traded with most enthusiasm by widowed Clairee ( played by Dukakis ) and with most bark and a little bite by Ouiser ( Maclaine ) . As the film opens Darryl Hannah 's Annelle has blown into town not sure if she 's married or not ( good fodder for the gossipers ) and ready to put her fledgeling beauty technician skills to work at Truvy 's , just before Shelby 's wedding.The spark in the film comes from the interactions of these female characters who have known each other in this small town all their lives . They know about Shelby 's diabetes and about Ouiser 's wang-dang and flapdoodle , and interest is generated seeing these characters knowingly dance around one another.There are no crimes - of the heart or otherwise . No murders . No secret affairs . The Lord 's name is taken in vain a few times , but Annelle lets ` em know she do n't appreciate it.This world is fictional , but so are Never-Never Land , Middle Earth and most other worlds we visit in film , so as a native southerner I 'm able to reconcile things like accents : Dolly is pretty stuck playing women with an East Tennessee twang , and to be honest I found Julia 's accent no better than Olympia 's . You 'd think for two Oscar-winning actresses that the one from Georgia would have a better Louisiana drawl than the one from Massachusetts , but there ya ' go.The Mrs. Tells me I too often am critical of films that stretch my suspension of disbelief . This one stretched me , but only a little , and I liked the movie overall . The Mrs . Loves it .	1
It 's one of the greatest movies ever made . I worked security on the movie , and got me meet some of the stars . This is one of the best films Dolly Pardon ever made . It worth the money .	1
This was a re-visit # 3 for me viewing 'Steel Magnolias ' , where women were women and men were not as good . Louisiana in the 1980 's , the good old days when young women died from the complications of diabetes and kidney disease.Dolly Parton owns the local beauty shoppe , where anyone and everyone in the know has their hair done , and all the troubles of the town are taken into account . The young bride-to-be , Selby , played by Julia Roberts , comes here with her mother , Sally Field , to have their hair done . The new hairdresser , played by Daryl Hannah , plies her trade and wins them over . The rich and mean woman of the town , played by Shirley MacLaine , comes to visit and leave her pearls of wisdom . Olympia Dukakis , whose character has lost her husband , has the real wisdom in they town.These six Southern women are the steel magnolias of the town . Beautiful on the outside , most of them , with steel spines on the inside . But , then , are n't most women like that ? The film is characterized as a woman 's chick flick , but that is wrong . This is a film for everyone , and gives us a chance to cry a little . This is a film for entertainment , to sweep us away from our troubles and to concentrate on the troubles of others.Recommended . prisrob 07-06-13	1
There is a scene in Sleepless in Seattle when Sam ( Tom Hanks ) , Suzy ( Rita Wilson ) , and Greg ( Victor Garber ) are discussing what are frequently referred to as `` chick flicks . '' Whatever the criteria for selection , there are many candidates for this category which usually include Steel Magnolias . After seeing it again recently , I decided that calling it a `` chick flick '' demeans what director Herbert Ross and his cast and crew achieved . This film really does have wide and deep appeal to both and men and women of all ages . Of greater significance , it seems even better each time it is seen again . The reverse is true of almost all other films which touch our hearts . As in Robert Harling 's play on which it is based , all of the main characters are women : Clairee Belcher ( Olympia Dukakis ) , M'Lynn Eatenton ( Sally Field ) , Truvy Jones ( Dolly Parton ) , Annelle Depuy Desoto ( Daryl Hannah ) , Ouiser Boudreaux ( Shirley MacLaine ) , and Shelby Eatenton Latcherie ( Julia Roberts ) .MacLaine and Roberts were later nominated for an Academy Award as best actress in a supporting role ; a split vote probably cost both an Oscar . My own opinion is that Field , Dukakis , and Hannah were equally deserving of that nomination . In terms of plot , not a great deal happens . The film 's energy is established and then sustained by the interactions between and among the five older women . Keep in mind that this was originally a play whose plot focused almost entirely on the shared experiences of those women . Some of the scenes are hilarious , with MacLaine and Dukakis primarily responsible . However , the film also includes one extended situation which has a genuinely sad conclusion . ( It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen the film to say any more about that . ) I think the acting is first-rate throughout . Most of this film is highly entertaining but whenever necessary and appropriate , Ross examines serious issues with great skill . Two points need to be reiterated : Steel Magnolias can and will appeal to men as well as to women , and , it is more enjoyable each time it is seen again . Those who share my high regard for it are urged to check out Fried Green Tomatoes ( 1991 ) .	1
Steel Magnolias is a movie that is timeless . You can not beat it . I know I am in a minority in saying that it is better than Terms of Endearment and Fried Green Tomatoes but in my opinion it really is . The love between the characters is more real and heartfelt and is n't as dismal to watch as in the previous two films . The acting is awesome , as well as the score and plot . The movie will rip your heart out . I highly reccomend it .	1
This also was purchased as a DVD to replace the VHS tape in my collection . Again it 's one I feel most people who enjoy Romantic Comedies most likely have already seen , so my reviewing it again is moot.Let it to suffice to say that this goes down as an all time Romantic Comedy Classic . Everyone of these 6 stars brought their own special & # 34 ; something & # 34 ; to this movie , and it would not have been the some if any one of them were missing.My movie collection would not be complete without it .	1
I 've seen this movie so many times and it never gets old . Definitely a must see if you 're from the south . It 's even more special to me because I actually lived in the town where it was filmed ( Natchitoches , LA ) The town really is like that in real life and the story is based on people who lived there .	1
Classic movie - great lines and many famous actors and actresses- Oliva dukacus is very good and so is McClaine	1
Finally found this on DVD ! I looked everywhere for this movie and finally found it on here . A classic that is a must have !	1
I bought this as a gift for my mom and step-dad . Neither of them had seen it before . We are all from the south and I knew that they would see so much in this movie that reminded them of our younger days in the old south . They both loved it and laughed hysterically when they told me how much they enjoyed watching it . Another great product at a great price .	1
By turns elegiac , romantic , scary , sad and heroic , director Barry Levinson 's THE NATURAL concerns a man sidetracked by a severe injury for nearly two decades who finally gets his chance to star in the Major Leagues , for the mythical New York Knights.Roy Hobbs and Wonder Boy , the bat he carved from a tree felled by lightning , quickly turn the team 's fortunes around , yet after-effects of an old gunshot wound to the torso may kill him before season 's end.This screen adaptation of a Bernard Malamud novel ( loosely based on Arthurian legend ) changes that author 's dark ending to one of triumph.Its main character has much in common with Bosox slugger Ted Williams : uniform number , batting style , wanting to be the best of all time , hitting a home run in his last at bat , etc . The shattered scoreboard actually happened at Ebbetts Field and the shooting incident was also taken from a true event , the wounding and comeback of Phillies first baseman Eddie Waitkus.Highest recommendation for one of the most inspirational sports movies ever made.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating . ( 7.4 ) The Natural ( 1994 ) Robert Redford/Glenn Close/Kim Basinger/Wilford Brimley/Barbara Hershey/Robert Prosky/Joe Don Baker/Michael Madsen/Robert Duvall ( uncredited : Darren McGavin )	1
One of the signs of a great movie is how fast it flies by . Fine direction by Levinson keeps this movie interesting and evolving from the opening scenes of Ray as a teen , to the final sequence . I believe this is the best baseball movie , but to compare films in this genre is n't fair . You like a `` Field of Dreams , Bull Durham , '' or even a `` Bang The Drum Slowly '' for completely different reasons . But on its own merits , this movie fits so much content , paralleling baseball and non-baseball related themes by use of clever direction . Using the backdrop of a beautiful period piece with excellent costuming , superb use of color and lighting , and the best score of any baseball movie ever , the mood and feel of the era this movie takes place in is palpable ( equal to The Godfather in those regards in my opinion ) . The feel this creates almost makes you yearn for its era 's simplicity . This movie is loaded with symbolism on so many levels , the least being a very religious one too obvious to miss . But also by using mythical proportions , the movie succinctly develops Redford 's Hobbs talent level before us . This is a sticking point for many , the over use of myth . If so , then why the praise for `` Field of Dreams '' as a baseball movie when there 's ghosts coming from a cornfield , and the dead coming back to life ? In doing so in `` The Natural , '' the lessons of morals , temptation , greed , vulnerability , integrity and others are instilled in the viewers conscience . It 's deviation from the book serves this purpose well . Why this movie gets so bashed because it 's not the same ending as the book I do n't know . One can point to many widely accepted classics that deviate greatly from their books , but get nothing but praise . The casting is superb . These people fit their characters like a well lubed new glove . Too many to single out . Just a great ensemble . You do n't compare this movie to a `` Major League , '' even a Damn Yankees , a fun movie in its own right for different reasons , and it 's a musical . You watch them for different reasons . To compare which is better is just silly . But in over all content and simply being a beautiful film , I think this movie is incomparable in its genre . Not just 1 of my favorite baseball movies , but movies in general .	1
A wonderfully remastered edition of this classic movie . Bought it , along with Major League , for my dad for Christmas to go with his new Blu-ray player . His eyes lit up just as much for this as for his new Kindle Fire that he opened five minutes before ! Fantastic quality HD picture for such an old film .	1
Nominated for four Academy Awards , The Natural is one of Robert Redford 's best pictures . The breathtaking cinematography , coupled with the bold original score by Randy Newman , makes The Natural one of the most memorable films of its time . A classic baseball film , based on the best-selling novel , the movie has managed to insert itself into the pop culture . Certainly no little league player , nor major league player for that matter , can escape the sounds of Roy Hobbs and his mystical abilities when stepping into the batter 's box with the game on the line ... The Natural is quite simply one of the best baseball films around - up there with Field Of Dreams , Eight Men Out , and Major League ... Written more like a fairy tale than a modern drama , The Natural follows the life and times of Roy Hobbs ( Robert Redford ) , a man trained from his earliest days to love the game of baseball by his father . When the boy 's father dies of a heart attack on the family farm , Roy uses the wood from the lightning-felled tree under which his father died to fashion a homemade baseball bat . In love with the girl next door , Iris Gaines ( Glenn Close ) , Roy leaves the farm after promising to come back to her in order to pursue a tryout as a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs . But Roy never makes it back ... Mysteriously shot by a woman he meets in a hotel room , Roy 's career is nearly ended by internal injuries . When Roy reappears twenty years later as a forty-year-old rookie for a last place team , he faces opposition from the team coach Pop Fisher ( Wilford Brimley ) who believes his business partner , The Judge ( Robert Prosky ) , is intentionally sabotaging the team in an effort to cheat Pop Fisher out of his ownership shares . But when Pop Fisher finds out that Hobbs can not only play , but is the best player to ever set foot on a baseball diamond , the team 's losing ways are put to an end - at least until Hobbs decides to complicate his life further ... Involving himself with Pop 's niece , Memo Paris ( Kim Basinger ) , Roy finds the level of his game dropping off . Despite Pop 's warnings , Roy develops a relationship with the girl who is in partnership with the Judge to keep the team stuck in its losing ways . However , when Iris reenters Roy 's life ( along with her teenage son ) , Roy 's play begins to pick up . But the championship is in jeopardy when a familiar reporter , Max Mercy ( Robert Duvall ) , comes dangerously close to uncovering Roy Hobbs 's mysterious past and internal bleeding threatens the life and career of the game 's greatest slugger ... Sporting a different ( Hollywood-ized ) ending from the novel which spawned its release , The Natural is nonetheless one of the most inspiring , feel good movies of all time . The 1930 's setting , and the seemingly one-dimensional characters , create an innocence of times past that make this movie seem like a flashback to the Frank Capra era . The musical score will create a literal tingling in your bones , and the hero-wins screenplay is one to be appreciated in this era of cynic realism . All these aspects of the film work together to make The Natural one of the most entertaining films around as well as earn it the designation of a must-see film ... Pop this one into the DVD player and go live the magic ! The DVD Report	1
Have enjoyed this movie many times . A young country boy who has a talent but no clue on life . It 's timeless !	1
For everyone who as a kid who stood in the outfield , held a baseball glove to their face and connects the smell of well dressed glove leather to their youth and summer on the diamond ... this movie is for you . I bet that almost every kid who played baseball at any level , had many day dreams of being & quot ; The Natural & quot ; , playing at a level above all others , and getting the & quot ; big hit & quot ; or making the & quot ; big play & quot ; . The Natural is n't reality , and it should n't be . It 's about the & quot ; what if & quot ; of baseball that reaches into the soul of the former sandlot player , adds some adult twists , and connects the childhood dreams to the adult cinema . I enjoy this film , not because it 's about the way it is , but because it 's the way I dreamed it could be . Roy Hobbs ( the main character played by Redford ) appears to have it all . Looks , incredible talent , big league prospects , when his life takes a sudden unfortunate turn . He returns to baseball and against the odds , lives a baseball dream . Dramatic ? Yes . Realistic ? Not really . But I 'd rather be entertained by this baseball fantasy , than watch the biography of today 's typical player . It 's more pleasurable to watch Roy Hobbs overcome his baseball challenges , than to watch a player go though drug rehab and salary arbitration while batting .260.On the cast , Redford is perfectly cast , and Wilford Brimley as Pops the Team Manager is right on the nose . This is a very good baseball film that deserved better treatment by the critics . If you 're sick of & quot ; shoot 'em ups & quot ; and pointless shock films , watch & quot ; The Natural & quot ; for a nice break .	1
What else can be said ? Roy Hobbs and The Natural define baseball . And the film dynamics propel this story to another level . If you have n't seen it , please ... treat yourself . It 's part of Prime , so it 's FREE . If you 're not Prime , seriously ... JOIN ! The access to films like this is more than worth the yearly fee ...	1
There are two types of baseball movies , those that attempt to tell the story of real ballplayer ( such as `` Pride of the Yankees , '' `` The Monty Stratton Story , '' and `` Fear Strikes Out '' ) , which , although often romanticized a bit , nevertheless portray the struggles and successes of a ballplayer in a realistic fashion . Then there are the baseball fantasies . These are to be enjoyed , not because they are realistic but because they capture the essence of what every baseball playing youth wishes for himself -- becoming the greatest baseball player of all time . `` The Natural '' is one of the latter . Roy Hobbs ( Robert Redford ) is a larger than life up and coming ballplayer , a youngster whose blazing fastball can strike out the greatest players of the game and who can consistently hit prodigious homeruns . However , shortly after reaching the Majors he is accosted in his hotel room by a woman whom he has met on the train to his big-league destination . She shoots him , and then commits suicide . ( In Malamud 's book by the same title this event was based on the real-life confrontation between Ruth Ann Steinhagen and Eddie Waitkus of the Phillies in Chicago 's Edgewater Beach Hotel in 1948 . The one difference is that Steinhagen did n't commit suicide but lived a long life after the incident , dying in 2013 . ) Those severely injured , Hobbs recovers , but his Major League career seems to be in tatters.However , Hobbs never gives up . Years later , after spending years in the minors , Hobbs again surfaces on a Major League roster . At first , his manager does n't want to play him , but , with the team in a huge slump , he gives Hobbs a chance out of desperation . Hobbs responds . The old magic comes back . The team goes on a tear , as Hobbs hits ball after ball out of the park . However , somewhat predictably , Hobbs goes into a slump late in the season at about the time the team moves into first . Soon the team is back to its losing ways . The question is whether Hobbs will regain his magic one more time and put the team on top.Although `` The Natural '' is a baseball fantasy , it is more than a mere fantasy . It is also a story of perseverance , corruption and greed ( though not on the part of Hobbs ) , and the value of personal integrity . It is a movie the entire family can enjoy . Though the outcome is rather predictable , it 's fun to watch .	1
IF you love baseball , you will LOVE this movie . If you love sports , you will LOVE this movie . I consider this to not only be one of the best ( if not the best ) baseball movies , but one of the best sports movie of all time . It is just a feel good movie and one that I never get tired of watching . This film stands out almost the crowded sports films . But this is n't just another sports movie . It is a very nice and well told fable . Everyone dreams of hitting the game winning homerun . This just visualize that dream for all of us and it is marvelously well done . It 's about getting a second chance at something and seizing it and what could be a better story than that . No cynicism in here , no evil , no bizarre plot twist , it just a nice simple story that just happen to use american 's past time as a backfield .	1
I approach reviewing the movie 'The Natural ' with some fear and trembling -- not being someone raised on American sports , baseball has often held the image in my mind as being a sort of circular cricket game . However , beyond the basic mechanics of the game is the psychology , and , by and large , there is a very different mindset to athletics in America than there is outside of America ( though this is changing over time ) ; certainly as I was growing up , I had no sports-figure heroes , nor did I ever consider professional sports as a potential career even in a fantasy.Beyond the general psychology of sports in America , baseball has a ranking with pride of place , being a national pasttime . To this end , to further my research for this review , I treated myself to that most American of activities , a baseball game , on that most American of holidays , the fourth of July . Being nearest to Indianapolis , there are no major leagues in town , so I went to the minor league game ( Indianapolis Indians against the Louisville Riverbats -- the Indians won handily 7-2 ) . I finally began to have some insights into what could be interesting and exciting and fun about baseball . I am certain that my reflections on 'The Natural ' would be very different without that experience.Perhaps it is a fantasy of many Americans to be a natural at sports in general , and some sport in particular . Baseball , having been woven into the history of the country , gives a particular insight into what can be best and worst in life through the game -- honour , glory , happiness ; greed , betrayal , vice.Barry Levinson 's 1984 film , 'The Natural ' , shows the love of the game in full force . Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs , an almost mythically inspired character , complete with mythic instruments ( a bat that is made from a lightning charged tree , perhaps a bat 'anointed by the gods ' , as it were ) . Having been a natural from childhood days , he suffers an injury by a mysterious woman in his young manhood that ( so far as we know in the film ) cuts short a promising career . Is she the Delilah that cuts down a Sampson ? If so , why ( other than to set up the rest of the film ) .Many years later , a much more mature Hobbs returns from out of nowhere to lead a desperate team to victory , overcoming the greed and corruption that big-time money injects into the game for a riveting , round-the-bases having hit out the lights home run that brings the fans to their feet and the puts the bad guys to shame.What could be more natural than that ? While this is a good story and ends with a happy , yet somewhat incomplete scene of Hobbs playing ball with with a boy ( will he be a natural , too ? ) while a rescued woman ( oh yes , did I forget the love story ? -- my mistake -- Glenn Close turns in a reasonable but far from her best performance as the love interest on the sidelines while Kim Basinger plays the sultry temptress intertwined in the murky dealing with the power brokers ) watches , there are too many unexplained events and tenuous connexions for me to think of this as a great film . Unanswered questions abound.However , the movie is good entertainment , even for someone who has n't been to a baseball game . The pace is leisurely ( like a baseball game ) , and the action goes from slow to riveting to gentle to exciting and back again . The dialogue is not inspired , but adequate for the plot . Some judicious editing might have made the movie hold together a bit better.I can see the love of the game over all other considerations , and I can sense that in Hobbs character . And I can see the reality in many of the other characters . However , this is not executed well enough in philosophic terms to be a morality tale , and underdeveloped in human terms.In the end , like the baseball game I attended on the fourth of July , I 'm glad I saw it , but alas , I did n't fall in love with it . Perhaps I 'm just a cricket man at heart .	1
Robert Redford is the natural and perfect person to play this role . He does it so well that you ca n't help but really love this movie . I have watched it several times and still get the same feeling every time I watch it . Great movie !	1
An overage baseball player comes out of seemingly nowhere to become a legendary player with almost divine talent .	1
This is one of the finest films in cinematic history . It is a truly insiring story that anyone can relate to . Robert Redford is amazing in this role . It shows the true spirit of the sport . I can watch it again and again .	1
Old guy succeds at baseball hitting and pitching but only gets to hit in the pros ... lust , and rekindling a childhood romance , fatherhood and fighting corrupt forces sum to be an interesting tale even a little tear jerking . Good for the whole family .	1
I cited to this in a recent review and said it was the best sports movie I ever saw . So I pulled it out of the collection and watched it again . I realize now that I may have done it an injustice . Yes , for this reviewer it is a great Sports movie with all the details and trappings of professional sports , the femme de guerre , money changers and interesting characters following the sports carnival , probably since olympic wrestling in Sparta and Macedonia in 400 BC . But like Rocky ( One for God 's sake ) and Cinderella Man , it 's really more about life.Like Jim Braddock and Rocky ( again , there 's only one ) , Roy Hobbs could have been the greatest . Terry Malloy has an interesting line in `` On the Waterfront '' ( Brando ) . He tells his brother Charley Malloy ( Steiger ) `` I coulda ' been SOMEBODY . `` Well Hobbs missed the boat . But when he surpresses ( you ca n't kill the bastards , you just chain them up ) his demons , he shows up on the stairs of the dugout to Wilfred Brimley 's `` dead from the neck up '' major leauge ball club . It 's the 1930 's but baseball , remarkably , is baseball . Brimley tells Roy `` guys your age are retiring , not in their rookie year . `` Suspecting that management is involved in a conspiracy to sink the team even further , Pops tells Richard Farnsworth his dugout coach 'but I ai n't gon na play him . 'Roy Hobbs ca n't pitch anymore but he can hit the stuffing out of the ball ( he actually does ) and Farnsworth intercedes for him with Pops and sticks him in the lineup . With a lot of great scenes in this Levinson masterpiece one of my favorites is his first time up . He takes a ball and the ump calls it a strike . And Roy mutters , 'no it 's not . 'A great movie with a near mythic analogy . Hershey and Bassinger are the evil women sent to derail Hobbs . You think of Homer warning Odysseus to avoid the sirens on the shore . Glenn Close is almost saintly . When she stands up at what will be the end of his slump at Wrigley Field and the light is incandescent around her head , hell , you think you too are having a religious experience.The conversations between Brimley and Farnsworth are worth the price of admission . And Farnsworth is like a soothsayer in the ancient greek plays . Retribution . Amending . Sorrow . Dismas . Second chances . Loyalty . Love conquers . . . . yeah , you guessed it . My favorite . Because Redford always brought a sense of quiet intensity ( Condor , All the President 's Men ) we forget sometimes that in his own right he produced and directed close to 30 films beyond appearing in movies as an actor . 5 stars . Larry Scantlebury	1
This Movie is bound to be a classic , if you like Baseball you will enjoy this show . The movie shows values but once again in life we can make choices that will cost us . This is a story about just that . The right choice will live with you forever , but the wrong one will take you down . Robert Redford was at his finest in this Picture and so was the supporting cast you will enjoy it .	1
Loved this movie when it came out on VH1 and just had to have it . Even if you are not a fan of baseball , it is a great story to prove thatyou can do anything you put your mind to again .	1
Superb !	1
Roy Hobbs , played by Robert Redford , is a farm boy with a hankering to be a great baseball player . And like Roy Hobbs , is n't it every kids dream to one day be a great baseball player ? Just like the good old days Roy Hobbs plays catch with his father and makes his own baseball bat called & # 34 ; Wonderboy. & # 34 ; The story is easy for a lot of us to identify with playing baseball with friends on corner lots with a splintered bat and tattered baseballs every chance we could get.Later in life , on his way to the big city to hopefully fulfill his dreams he 's lured into the clutches of a wicked woman , Harriet Bird , played by Barbara Hershey , catches a bullet in his rib cage , and is sidelined from playing baseball . This movie has a great line-up of movie stars including Glen Close.But nothing is going to keep Roy Hobbs down . Bound and determined the 35 year old & # 34 ; rookie & # 34 ; has a comeback when he 's in the line-up of the New York Knights in 1939.I like baseball stories where a star player never give up but pulls himself up by his boot straps and comes out of grass roots America to fulfill his passion to play baseball , and I give this great movie five stars . Marvin P. Ferguson , author of THE UNKNOWN BASEBALL PLAYER .	1
I 've heard many critics deride The Natural as hokum . They dismiss the film as well crafted , but criticize it as too long and too overblown . To be sure , The Natural does n't bear much resemblance to the novel by Bernard Malamud in which Roy Hobbs takes money , strikes out to lose the pennant and is forced from baseball in disgrace . However , the film , as presented , is a wonderful realization of every baseball fan 's dream . What baseball fan ever dreamed of winning the World Series with a sacrifice fly ? When children dream of baseball , they dream of hitting a massive grand slam in the seventh game of the World Series with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and the home team trailing by three runs . The Natural is the visual realization of every baseball fan 's dream . Roy Hobbs hits the monumental home runs that every fan dreams about -- shots that destroy clocks , literally knock the covers off balls and annihilate light towers . Just as with all our goals in life , we , as baseball fans , do n't fantasize about just barely clearing the outfield wall , we want to blast each pitch into outer space , ensuring that everyone will remember our moment of glory . So few of us ever come close to realizing even a fraction of our dreams . Unless they are a New York Yankees fan , every baseball fan has many more moments of heartbreak than exhiliration . The Natural allows all baseball fans to realize , however fleetingly , the sheer joy of seeing their dreams realized .	1
Feel good movie even if you hate baseball . Kinda hokey but fun . he only really dumb part is Redford supposed to be a really young man in the begining . Make up has come a long way since this movie was made .	1
I first saw this film in Chicago when it came out ... loved it then . I was not sure I could watch it on my Kindle but was pleasantly surprised that the screen size made no difference and the streaming never let it pause ... great film , great story !	1
L like Robert Redford and & # 34 ; The Natural & # 34 ; but I could have done without the Director.and all his talking . But the movie is great .	1
I am just a sucker for sports movies where the underdog makes the most of a second chance . Does n't everyone want to succeed at their second chance ?	1
This was a christmas Gift . Santa Studded it in the stockingof a very lucky family . What a get together they had .	1
This is a great movie with a great ending ! I wonder if this is where current stadiums got their idea for fireworks when a home player hits a homer . The only thing is this longer version is slow in parts . That 's OK because too many movies have some necessary parts cut out . I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of any of the stars or baseball !	1
Philadelphia starring Tom Hanks is a powerful movie from beginning to end . I have seen this film many times and I am still moved by the plot and incredible acting especially by Hanks . His performance was a turning point in his career , this film brought him back from his short hiatus . Denzel Washington also stars as Hank 's lawyer and even though Washington 's character can be superficial at times , he is able to show the many different aspects of a person not familiar with AIDS or homosexuality . If you want a deep and profound film about love , forgiveness , and the strength to stand up for injustice then Philadelphia is the film for you . Enjoy !	1
It 's a very personal drama , but it is also significantly a courtroom drama , which I happen to love . It also includes three actors I love : Tom Hanks , Denzel Washington , and Antonio Banderas . How can it lose ? Andrew Beckett ( Hanks ) is fired from his law firm when the partners discover he has AIDS . They set him up with a phoney incompetence incident ( complaint due that day disappears , reappears as mysteriously within minutes of time to get it to the courthouse ) which he can see right through . So he wants to file a suit for wrongful termination . Joe Miller ( Washington ) is the ninth attorney he consults , who is plainly homophobic . In fact , his wife calls him out on it , and he admits it . However , after he catches Beckett in the law library trying to prepare the case for himself ( It 's a long-standing legal tradition that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client . ) , and being hassled by the library clerk , he decides to accept the case.Antonio Banderas plays Beckett 's boyfriend , who has been taught how to give him his IV treatments so he does n't have to be forever in hospital or clinic , and is generally a very likeable partner . It 's easy to see why they love each other ; they 're both attractive , intelligent and compassionate.And that 's what a lot of the story is about : the audience , the jury , and the general public are forced to face the fact that gay people are people . Seen through the lens of the old partners of his firm , who tell crude homophobic jokes in the steam room of the athletic club , the response is that they probably did not know he was gay . But one partner `` suspected , '' as he brought out . And another had worked with a woman who had AIDS at a previous firm , mentioning in his testimony that he had the greatest sympathy for people like her who got this terrible disease `` through no fault of their own . '' She testified that she had a blood transfusion after her second child was born , and that 's how she got AIDS . The implication , of course , was that he had no sympathy for people who got it through homosexual activity . One of the jurors is heard to comment under his breath , `` Got what was coming to him . `` Funny side story : The lead trial lawyer for the firm , played by Mary Steenbengen , had the bitch female attorney role so down pat I had to look at the credits to make sure she was not being played by someone I knew at the Superior Court in Santa Cruz . Actually , I think I 've seen her play female attorneys before , probably in one or more of Robert Grisham 's excellent courtroom dramas.Fine movie , something of a tear jerker , but also a real eye-opener to the biases against gays and victims of AIDS . And a chance to see some familiar old places in Philadelphia , as well as to marvel at the fact that I can not remember what building was on that corner before a shiny sky-scraper took it up . Could n't have been the corner Wanamaker 's was on , could it ?	1
I had never seen this movie and my husband mentioned wanting to watch it so I ordered it off of here because of the good price and quick shipping ( Prime account ) . It was really good , but sad , and had some great acting . Love Tom and Denzel .	1
How do you separate a socially important film from a great film ? Sure this film tackled the AIDS/homosexuality issue head-on but that does n't automatically make it a great film . I 'm not knocking this film , of course not . But there 's a lot of parts in it that I did n't like which maybe made it appear to be a lesser film than what it wants to be , it is or what everyone makes it out to be.Andrew Beckett works for a prestigious law firm working on a big account . His health declines a little bit nothing overly serious until he 's fired for apparently botching the case . Turns out not only is he a homosexual but he has AIDS so he figures that 's why he was fired . He needs representation so he hires Joe Miller , a top and famous attorney who is , rather bluntly , very intolerant of gays . So they form an unlikely duo to battle a top firm while dealing with gay bashers to closet gays.One small nitpick : it seemed like anyone that is in Andy 's family or friends circle is against him . There was not a lot of normal everyman citizens who supported him . A similar problem in Brokeback Mountain where any scene with the 2 men was gorgeously shot while them with their wives looked rather bland and desolate looking , complete with sad looking wives . It 's nothing that derails the film though . And I do n't know why but I never liked Jonathan Demme 's trademark of looking in the camera . It works for Silence of the Lambs but here it looks ... weird , and maybe a bit too on the nose.Now Tom Hanks did win the award for Best Actor but honestly it should 've went to Denzel Washington who manages to be visibly struggling with his less-than-enthusiastic view on gays and the changing perspectives dealing with the case . Hanks , in a way , reminds me of Charlize Theron who put on ugly makeup for Monster . Losing a crapload of weight does not automatically give you an Oscar . No knock against Hanks but it seems funny it went to him instead of Washington.Is it a watchable film ? Of course , it 's quite good and performances are excellent . I do n't know whether you should blind buy it though , that 's up to you .	1
Movie is all about an attorney ( Hanks ) who was fired because he had Aids . Hanks needs an attorney to represent him in court , he goes to Washington . The problem is that Washington was in the dark about how you get aids . He thinks if you shake hands you 'll get sick . He takes on the case and the movie really takes off . There are a lot of well known actors in this movie . It shows how negative people are about Aids . Hanks family have always supported him . They accept him as he is . I am not going to mention who Hanks love partner is . It 's hard to get your head around it . He is always a ladies man .	1
This movie features heroic performances by Denzel Washington , Antonion Banderas and , of course , Tom Hanks . Jonathan Demme 's direction is brilliant and each time I see the movie , I discover something new about Demme 's method of telling this story.The movie is not perfect . Some of the pacing of the courtroom scenes misses somehow . While Tom Hanks 's character 's family is movingly supportive and loving , the movie would have been still more realistic if it had somehow portrayed some tension in the family , sadly more characteristic of the situation of gay men and their families.As a DVD , it is pretty much barebones . I would have treasured some extras.This movie probably did a great deal to bring AIDS awareness to mainstream audiences . It is a fine work and everyone should see it .	1
and i 'm greatful for that ... one of the few comics who was able to make the successful transition to dramatic actor . denzel is excellent as hank 's lawyer who comes to term 's with his latent homophobia ... my favorite scene in the movie is when hanks goes into diva mode describing a opera piece sung by maria callas . i have the song on a c.d . somewhere . hanks probably gave an even better performance when he gave his best actor oscar acceptance speech , thanking a high school teacher who was gay . so emotional .	1
Tom Hanks , Denzel Washington , and director Johnathan Demme more than deserve the accolades received for this story of a gay , AID-stricken attorney who sues the lawfirm that unjustly fires him ; in fact , Demme and his cast are so incredibly good that you wo n't realize how one-dimensional the script is until you 've had time to recover yourself after the film 's powerful conclusion.The problem with the script , at least as I see it , is that PHILADELPHIA is written in such a way as to create maximum identification with and sympathy for Hanks , and in consequence it never goes any further than it absolutely must into the myriad of issues swirling around the AIDS epidemic ; there is no real effort to look beyond the the deliberately glossy , upper-middle-class surface the film posits as reality . Well intentioned , no doubt , but the film never actually makes a viable statement of any kind.Even so , Hanks , Washington , and the astonishingly gifted cast turn PHILADELPHIA into a powerfully emotional experience , and that alone is more than worth the price of admission . Strongly recommended -- but if you 're looking for more in an AIDS-related film than an exercise in catharsis , you may be disappointed .	1
Back in 1993 , AIDS had been in the forefront of the news and everyone 's minds for quite a while . Still , a major Hollywood movie still had n't dealt with the subject matter . Sure we had some incredible films like `` Longtime Companion '' and the stunning `` Parting Glances '' ( both which I highly recommend as truly visionary cinema ) , but they were more independent and not likely seen by mainstream audiences . Finally , with the foresight of Jonathan Demme , and the star power of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington , Philadephia roared onto the screens and into our hearts . And now , finally , we have a DVD treatment that this movie truly deserves.Andrew Beckett , high priced lawyer of a top Pennsylvania law firm , suffers from AIDS quietly at the beginning of the film . A lesion betrays his secret quickly , leading to his dismissal . Firing back , Beckett attempts to secure the services of Joe Miller , a personal injury lawyer with an everyman reputation . At first rejecting his offer and even pouring salt in his wounds by mocking him , Miller is converted to the cause after witnessing subtle discrimination in a library . It is through Miller that everyone can approach this story , and it is through Beckett that we learn dignity and we learn pain.Much as been said about Tom Hanks ' Academy Award winning performance as Beckett , and Denzel Washington 's wonderful portrayal as Miller . Together , the two are an acting powerhouse , both equally dynamic and compelling in their characters . One can only wish they would team up again sometime in the future . At any rate , they are supported by a fine ensemble , starting with the late Jason Robards to the rarely seen and much missed Joanne Woodward , whose performance will reduce you to tears in seconds.Included in this DVD package are several documentaries detailing the development of the movie . The director 's and writer 's commentaries shed wonderful light into the process that went into making the movie . The few deleted scenes are wonderful to see , especially during a `` settlement '' negotiation between the parties . One very poignant thing mentioned in the documentary were the number of people suffering with AIDS that were employed in this movie , both in front of and behind the scenes . Very touching.But this is n't just a movie about AIDS . This is a movie that soars above the simple `` movie of the week '' syndrome , and dares to address such things as tolerance , acceptance , getting over your fears , and welcoming people for who they are . It 's amazing how relevant and meaningful those messages are today . In a climate of unacceptance and intolerance to others , hopefully Philadelphia 's essential meanings will continue to ring as a bell of Liberty , and not just in the streets of the town of Brotherly Love .	1
I am very happy to inform you of my expereience with Amazon.comhas been very good . All items that I have ordered have been shipped to me so quicky . I like the e-mails that have been sent to me , when my order was processed and when I can expect the arrival of it .	1
The first mainstream film to deal squarely with the issue of AIDS , Demme 's groundbreaking `` Philadelphia '' is a profoundly moving drama that digs into the ethics of how society views gay men . Strong performances by Best Actor winner Hanks as the ailing Beckett and Washington as a city lawyer who comes to see his client 's disease not as a scourge to fear , but as an opportunity for compassion , will not leave a dry eye in your den . This is an eye-opening film , and still tremendously relevant today , with a memorable title song by Bruce Springsteen .	1
I had it it on VHS and did a search it came up on the kindle fire so I got it . It had been years and years since I watched the vhs tape . I had forgotten how hard it was for folks needing HIV/AIDs treatment in the late 1980s and early 1990s . Well acted by two of my fav actors	1
The story line makes you feel so much for the guy getting beat down by society , but it makes you feel so good inside when justice is finally served in the end . Very powerful , very poignant movie .	1
This movie brings forth the social issues that our society deals with everyday . The highlight of this movie is n't the courtroom drama , as I initially thought . Instead , the strengths are the emotions that the characters portray . This movie does n't merely deal with the discrimination against the AIDS virus and homosexuality . It deals with bias and segregation in a broad landscape . Andy Bennett ( Tom Hanks ) was fired from his job mainly because of his sexual preference . He was defended by Joe Miller ( Denzel Washington ) . Hanks and Washington are powerhouse actors and they work well together . I particularly did n't like the female defense lawyer for Wheeler and Co. She somehow did n't `` fit , '' or maybe her acting was just not convincing enough for me . I thought this movie would have some dramatic courtroom scenes , like those from `` Rules of Engagement '' and `` A Few Good Men . '' But I was a little dissappointed . The DVD does not pack any extra whatsoever . Despite , these limitation , this movie is enjoyable to watch due to the great acting of Hanks and Washington .	1
There really was a Baron Munchausen . His full name was Karl Friedrich Hieronymous von Munchausen , and he lived from 1720 to 1797 and fought for the Russians against the Turks . He was , it is said , in the habit of embellishing his war stories , and in 1785 a jewel thief from Hanover named Rudolf Erich Raspe published a book in England which claimed to be based on the baron 's life and times . The real von Munchausen apparently did not complain about this book that made free with his reputation , even though it included such tall stories as the time the baron tethered his horse to a & quot ; small twig & quot ; in a snowstorm , and discovered when the snow melted that the twig was actually a church steeple . I remember the illustration that appeared with that story when I read it as a child : The baron on the ground , looking up in perplexity at his horse , which was still hanging from the steeple . I remember asking my father how the horse was going to get down , and my father speculating that he would have to wait until it snowed again , which seemed like a bleak prospect for the horse . And so I asked if the baron could feed his horse in the meantime by climbing up the steeple with hay . The mind of a child is wonderfully literal . And one of the charms of seeing & quot ; The Adventures of Baron Munchausen & quot ; was to see some of the baron 's other impossible adventures , looking for all the world as if they had really happened , thanks to extraordinary special effects . For adults , this is a & quot ; special effects movie , & quot ; and we approach it in that spirit , also appreciating the sly wit and satire that sneaks in here and there from director Terry Gilliam and his collaborators , who were mostly forged in the mill of Monty Python . They have not made a & quot ; children 's movie , & quot ; but children may find it fascinating , because these adventures involve castles and sultans and horses and knights and the man in the moon - subjects that seem fresh , now that the high-tech hardware of outer space is taken for granted by most kids . Terry Gilliam 's film is , in itself , a tribute to the spirit of the good baron . Gilliam must have had to embellish a few war stories himself , to get Columbia Pictures to spend a reported $ 46 million on this project , which is one of the three or four most expensive films ever made . The special effects are astonishing , but so is the humor with which they are employed . It is not enough that one of the baron 's friends is the fastest runner in the world . He must run all the way to Spain and back in an hour , to fetch a bottle of wine and save the baron 's neck . And he must be able to outrun a speeding bullet , stop it , and redirect it back toward the man who fired it . These adventures , and others , are told with a cheerfulness and a light touch that never betray the time and money it took to create them . It 's one thing to spent $ 46 million ; it 's another to spend it insouciantly . The movie begins when the baron indignantly interrupts a play that is allegedly based on his life , and continues as he tells the & quot ; real & quot ; story of his travels - which took him not merely to Turkey but also to the moon , to the heart of a volcano , and into the stomach of a sea monster so big that people actually lived there quite comfortably , once they had been swallowed . The baron ( John Neville ) is accompanied on some of these adventures by his friends , including not only the world 's fastest man , but also the world 's strongest man , the man with the best hearing in the world , and another friend who does not have great eyesight , but owns glasses that allow him to see almost any distance . Even when he is separated from these comrades , the baron travels in good company : when a Venus appears from a seashell , she is played by Uma Thurman , the young innocent from & quot ; Dangerous Liaisons , & quot ; and when the man in the moon appears , he is Robin Williams , with a detachable head that is able to spin off into the night on its own . Some of the effects in this movie are actually quite wonderful , as when the baron and a friend return from the moon by climbing down two lengths of the same rope again and again , while the markings of a celestial globe apportion the sky behind them . In another scene , a giant feather falls softly onto a vast plain , while the baron tries to understand what strange new world he has found . Neville , a veteran of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada , keeps his composure in the midst of these special effects , and seems sensible and matter-of-fact , as anyone would if they had spent a lifetime growing accustomed to the incredible . The wit and the spectacle of & quot ; Baron Munchausen & quot ; are considerable achievements . I wish only that Gilliam , who co-wrote the screenplay as well as directed , had been able to edit his own inspiration more severely as he went along . The movie is slow to get off the ground ( the prologue in the theater goes on forever before we discover what it 's about ) , and sometimes the movie fails on the basic level of making itself clear . We 're not always sure who is who , how they are related , or why we should care . One of the things you have to do , when you fill a movie with extravagant fantasies , is to explain the story in clear and direct terms , so it does n't fly apart with intoxication at its own exuberance . I was confused sometimes during & quot ; Baron Munchausen , & quot ; and bored sometimes , but this is a vast and commodious work , and even allowing for the unsuccessful passages there is a lot here to treasure . Gilliam says it is the third part of a trilogy . His first film , & quot ; Time Bandits , & quot ; was about childhood . His second , & quot ; Brazil , & quot ; was about adulthood . & quot ; Baron Munchausen & quot ; is about old age . He may be telling us the truth . He may also be telling us he has tethered his film to a twig in a snowstorm .	1
When this first came out I thought the ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN was just a fancy way to say `` Time Bandits 2 '' . Imagine my disappointment when , much like Napoleon , I discovered the tall statue of most of the cast . I had never heard of the Baron and could n't get into these `` adventures '' . But years later I have a different opinion . Terry Gilliam , who spent much of his early career cutting out bits of paper animations for John Cleese and the rest of Monty Python , shows how to tell a tale on the big screen . Lots of excitement and never boring . The visual effects are stunning in places ( the Baron 's trip across the sky on a morar shell and the amazing climb to the tip of the moon ) and wonderfully campy in others ( The moon king riding those ... er , whatever those were and the big fish scene ) . The variety of characters is refreshing and made me want to read some of the Baron 's other tales . The DVD picture and sound are very good . There is also lots of star power : John Neville ( The Fifth Element ) , Uma Thurman ( Pulp Fiction ) , Oliver Reed ( Oliver ! ) , Robin Williams ( Mrs. Doubtfire ) , Jonathan Pryce ( Brazil ) , and my favorite Eric Idle ( Monty Python ) . You wo n't be disappointed . ...	1
Constant unannounced shifting between story telling , flashbacks , and the present make for a somewhat unusual storyline . The movie is different than any you 've seen before . The Monty Python heritage of director Terry Glliam and Eric Idle in a supporting role is evident .	1
A flawed film ? Yes - and deeply so ; probably as a result of Gilliam and McKeown overreaching themselves to produce a hugely challenging film . According to the `` Making Of.. '' documentary extra ( and indeed movie making folklore ) the birth was an agonising one and nearly a stillbirth . If you believe some of the claims , the production was horrendously overspent even before filming began and relations between the crew broke down to the extent that the producer and director would n't even speak to one another on set , and no-one really knew how much the film was actually costing.Perhaps as as a result of the production company 's damage limitation efforts the plot is an incoherent mess : but do n't lose heart - if you accept it as being almost irrelevant to the film itself , you can happily sit back and enjoy the performances , the humour and the glorious spectacle of it.For me , the most enjoyable performance came from Sarah Polley as the little girl who may or may not be dreaming the whole story up , with honoourable mention going to Peter Jefferies as the Sultan ( look out for his serenade to the Baron on his `` torture organ '' ) . By contrast , I found Robin Williams ' cameo as the King of the Moon simply annoying , but then I 've always found his brand of humour seriously over the top.The spectacle is truly sumptuous and I suspect that Peter Jackson would have thought twice about what Gilliam was trying to achieve . Some of the sets do look very contrived ( outside the Sultan 's palace and when Eric Idle pops out to Vienna for a bottle of Tokay ) and amateurish . I wondered whether this was the effect of the spiralling costs , but it does give the film a dreamlike quality in places and it actually carries it off well , so perhaps it was intentional . The ending was possibly the biggest disappointment of the film - a terrible anticlimax - and again this may be down to the film 's problems.All in all , my balance sheet added up very much in the black . If you allow yourself to be entertained , forgive it its flaws and pay attention to the details , I suspect that you 'll love it . You might hate it , so read the reviews carefully before you buy it . `` I have learned from experience that a modicum of snuff can be most efficacious . `` RIP John Neville - 19 November 2011	1
Quite simply , watching this movie was a joy to behold . Terry Gilliam truely has a unique vision in creating fantasy worlds . There is still something to using traditional effects that CGI has yet to duplicate . The story is also unique in exploring the transition between the Age of Magic and the `` Age of Reason . ''	1
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a great family movie to watch roben willems makes a cameo as the king of the moon.you will get to see a hole wide of imgagtion come to life going to themoon or roamang through a giant wail . zany jokes make it fun to watch .	1
If you are asking if you should watch `` The Adventure of Baron Munchausen '' , the answer is yes , it is a superb movie , but quite off kilter , has some dull acts , but like `` Big Fish '' strikes a nice 4 star heart cord , but all the set pieces do n't quite work , but the ones that do , work quite well , so in-between periods of a little dullness , character interludes and surprisingly restrictive action sequences , can be skipped over ( it was a horrible affair of bad marketing , coupled with some obvious set problems - read the article - Dreams : The Adventures of Baron Munchausen , Edited by Phil Stubbs , on the internet ) results in a bit of an editing disaster , some bad special effects print work that means all original prints have strings and film scratch attached , the original film matte work is far from 1988 special effects quality , Baron Munchausen has not aged well and some of the gags where frankly dead for 1988 are unconvincing inorganic matter in the 21st century.Munchausen is all about ` touching intimate scenes of friendship ' that try to knit the story within a story , a pantomime hijacked by a member of the audience claiming to be the real Baron Munchausen and then off telling his tale , it covers all sorts of Aesop 's fables , plays to kids , but it not quite as entertaining for them as it should be , a bit too fantasy for most adult tastes , it plays better to an older Gilliam fan scene that can look at this in 2005 , see the history of 70s and 80s British new wave Comedy like Monty Python and its uinfluences , and the end of the saga about `` The imagination of youth ( Time Bandits ) , Middle age ( Brazil ) and finally old age ( Baron Munchausen ) '' it 's heart is in the right place and all involved do make an effort , it just never quite gels as a five star experience , but certainly Surprisingly Sentimental , all should watch Baron Munchausen for the moral and its message - that stories keep us going that bit longer and we should keep telling them . I remember back in 1988 that this movie cost $ 45 and was considered one of the most expensive film 's of all time , Europe 's biggest film , turned out that hype created by investors backfired the deal . Gilliam was pretty much a hostage director and even Christopher Lambert ( yeah , Highlander ) directed some scenes . Quasi-film making along the same lines as Time Bandits . Certainly the Baron is far from bad .	1
There are few films as rich in detail and design as this , so it 's sad that the Blu ray is only a shade better than the DVD . But it 's cheap , so , it 's worth it .	1
A favorite from Terry Gilliam . An engaging cast -- lots of & # 34 ; celebrity spotting & # 34 ; -- and a charming and fantastical story that stands the test of time .	1
The first time I watched this I was n't too impressed . But it grew on me . It is not a serious movie , so if you are buying it because you liked 12 Monkeys , you are in for a suprise . This is much more like Time Bandits or The Holy Grail in the level of sillyness.The movie is a simple tale of a man who tells tall tales , and his magical friends . They all go on a long trip together , not only around the world , but to the moon as well . In the end , everything is made right by magic , quite by suprise .	1
It 's saying something about a movie when a friend asks you for a recommendation in 2004 , and 1998 's `` The Opposite of Sex '' is one of the first things that pops into your head . Christina Ricci - in her first real adult role - rips the paint of the walls with her performance as Dede Truitt , a one-woman hurricane . She wreaks havoc here in everyone else 's life , starting with half-brother Bill , played by the always excellent Martin Donovan ( see , among others , `` Insomnia , '' in which he plays Al Pacino 's doomed partner ) .In fact , for all the attention garnered by what was essentially Ms. Ricci 's very successful coming out party , the real news here are the excellent turns by Donovan , Lisa Kudrow ( playing about as far from Phoebe as one can get ) and Lyle Lovett . Mr. Lovett proves her that he does n't need Robert Altman to transfer his charisma from his musical performances to film . [ He had been essentially an Altman 'house player ' up to this point in his career . ] The script is sharp and witty . We 've got Don Roos ( as writer and director ) to thank for that . I 'm a little perplexed by Mr. Roos ' career since that point - 'Bounce ' ( a disappointing Affleck/Paltrow outing ) came out in 2000 . He did have a critical hit with 2000 's TV summer replacement 'M.Y.O.B . 'Roos has proven himself to be a great writer who attracts quality stars and directs them to impressive performances . He does have 'Happy Endings ' in production right now with Ms. Kudrow and other talented actors . As far as I 'm concerned , his success with 'Opposite of Sex ' will compel me to see anything that he creates .	1
While not the best film of 1998 . The opposite of sex does manage to entertain and insult the viewer . People who are interested in the subject matter will like it even more . Lisa Kudrow is hilarious , and so is Christina Ricci in a part that established her as a good actress . I recommend you rent it first . While not for everyone , great script , good directing , great acting and story keep you entertained for a few hours .	1
Having seen other movies that Don Roos has written ( Boys On The Side , Love Field , Single White Female ) I did n't know what to expect of his directorial debut , but what I was in for was shocking , delightful , touching , and incredibly funny ! Christina Ricci is incredible , but more inspiring is Lisa Kudrow 's turn as the bitter and frustrated spinster . If only more directors would dare to make such unconventional movies more often .	1
I 'm a long-time fan of this film and I finally took the time to read all the reviews and comments already here at Amazon to find out what others thought . Usually I do n't add reviews to a film with an existing body of comments , feeling I have little to add to what others have already said , but in this case I 'm making an exception.One actor commented in another review that the performances come across as a cold read . While I agree with that opinion of some of the performances , acting is not my forte . I 'm a writer and my appreciation of this film is for the wonderful script . If you like your comedy dark and uncompromising , ( think Heathers ) then you will enjoy some of the crackling and sarcastic dialogue waiting for you in this story.The plot itself is n't designed to bring compelling comparisons to Citizen Kane . The characters are ignorant , easily manipulated , individuals . Contented and in some cases arrogantly complacent people have their lives turned upside down by the arrival of a trailer-trash backwater tramp . It 's a common enough contrivance to twist the `` fish out of water '' plot , but Ricci plays her part as one who is better prepared for her new environment than those that already call it home . Her performance is a tour de force and this film was the exact transitional point in her career that allowed her to move from the `` goth child '' whimsy of her early films into the sexier and more adult fare she tends to favor today . Her acting is actually a cut above what she delivers in films like Monster , where she at times seemed almost in awe of her costar . Here she takes center stage and the only real competitor in sight is Lisa Kudrow , who gives an uneven but wickedly sharp-tongued turn.An example of the dialogue I referenced earlier is provided by Kudrow in fact . Early in the film , Ricci announces she has become pregnant by her brother 's gay lover . Kudrow turns to the brother and says , `` I thought you were gay ! '' He informs her that he is bisexual and without missing a beat Kudrow retorts , `` Oh PLEASE ! I went to a Bar Mitzvah once and it did n't make me Jewish ! '' Her delivery of this line is full of such venom that half of the audience I saw it with was deeply offended while the other half , myself included , burst out in loud and approving laughter.Such is the nature of black comedy . It walks the fine line between offense and hysteria . When it misses the mark , as is often the case in lesser scripts , the entire film suffers . When it finds the balance it delights as many people as it offends . Such is the case with The Opposite of Sex . The majority of reviewers here have adored the crisp dialogue , and a vocal minority found themselves offended or lost.Amazon recently dropped the price of this movie and while the older $ 20 price tag may have made it a risky choice for someone who has n't already seen the film , at the new lower cost it 's worth every penny to give this movie the chance it deserves . If nothing else , it 's a chance to watch a young talent make the successful transition into adult-flavored roles that have eluded so many other child actors and actresses .	1
OK , first off , this review will focus on the film - not the quality of the DVD . People have reviewed this film giving it 1 Star just because of lack of extra DVD footage , poor quality etc . You 're not here to review the DVD content , but to focus on the film . So in the future , please do n't focus on the DVD extras , but the quality of the film . The Opposite Of Sex has to be one of the best films of the 90 's . This is a scathing , dark comedy best suited for people who enjoy films that shock you and are very truthful about the society we live in . Director Don Roos does an excellent job by sparing nothing and no one . The Opposite Of Sex did n't exactly set the Box Office alight , but its distinctive tone will stay with us for years as one of the best films in quite a while.Christina Ricci plays DeeDee Truitt . This acid-tounged , self-centered and rude teenager makes the biggest impact on the film and she also narrates the movie . This makes us see everything from her viewpoint . She comes from Louisiana , claiming to have been molested by her step-father . But because of her self-centered character , we are never sure if this is true . She goes to visit her gay half-brother , Bill , who lives in the Midwest and is a school teacher . She seduces his boyfriend , Matt . She makes him believe he 's the father to her child . Not the brightest star in the night sky , he believes everything she says and leaves his boyfriend for her ( he 's bisexual ) . Lisa Kudrow stars as Lucia . She is Bill 's best friend and fancies him . They both say goodbye to DeeDee and Matt . There 's trouble ahead when Matt 's other boyfriend , played by Jonny Galecki , demands to know where he is . Bill does n't know where he is , so he can not tell him . With this , Matt 's other boyfriend claims that Bill tried to seduce him when he was a student at the same high school Bill teaches at.After that , you 're probably left thinking that you would n't watch The Opposite Of Sex if it was the last movie on the Earth . But this is a film that you HAVE to see . The acting is absolutely superb and first-rate . Christina Ricci makes a convincing change from her role as Wednesday eight years previously in The Addams Family . While Lisa Kudrow is brilliant too . She also makes a convincing case from the dizzy Phoebe in Friends to an intelligent , yet wacky , Lucia . The film moves at a fast pace to keep you shocked and entertained . But I would say the film is at its best when Christina Ricci narrates the story , keeping you up to date . At the beginning , she tells us , `` I always carry a gun . You should always remember that . If you 're smart , you will '' . This challanges the audience into thinking they can compete with her . Yet you do actually forget she keeps a gun on her at all times because you 're so focused on the film . Another sign on great narration is when she is giving birth to her first child . She says , `` OK , enough of that '' . The screen is split in two . `` Here 's the rest , '' she says . The left hand of the screen continues the story , as the right hand focuses on a mute version of DeeDee giving birth - amazing and expertly done.This film may not be the biggest hit ever , but at least it deals with real-life issues and is frank and truthful in the telling - something you do n't see in pathetic action flicks such as The Mummy or Spiderman . The Opposite Of Sex is a film you will either love or hate because it 's full of sex and swearing . So love or hate , it 's your choice - I went with the former ...	1
but ultimately redeeming . This one moves fast and furious through the lives of these characters over the course of a year . Yes , there are plot holes and some illogical moments , but the performances and the wit save this film - big time . Ricci is absolutely hysterical ; you want to slap her so hard and yet she is too funny to let you go through with it . Very eclectic cast . Highly recommended .	1
I love this movie , ever since I originally saw it in a college class a few years ago . Christina Ricci is an absolute dream in this , and Lisa Kudrow is about as far removed from her Phoebe character as you could possibly get . I was n't so keen on Martin Donovan 's character , Bill , so much . He was very emotionless.It 's very fast-paced , with a very sarcastic narrative from Christina 's character , which is n't intrusive , and fills you in on stuff you might not have noticed/obvious stuff/stuff that is n't necessary to show in the movie , but needs to be mentioned . It is highly amusing , witty and provides the audience with a release during tense and heavily themed situations . Christina 's narrative is quite funny at times , as she comments on her own comments and on the movie itself , and most of the jokes come from her spoken lines . The film is suitably gritty and very well acted . Every character ( apart from Bill ) is suitably addictive to watch , which you want to know about DeeDee and her life . She smokes , she drinks , she pinches her nipples so they show through her top . A girl we 'd all want to be.The director has the audience in the palm of their hand when at one point during the movie , it shows how easily we can be manipulated by mood and music as well as the points that we show in a character 's life.This movie comes highly recommended , and a must-have for your collection of DVDs . It needs to be seen ( and heard ) to be believed . And it 's the perfect movie to watch to realise you 're not the only one out there with problems .	1
Ricci aside I thought Lisa Kudrow was a delight playing the oppisite of her well known ditzy blonde `` Friends '' type cast , which helps her to not become to much of a type casted actress . She does have range . I fully enjoyed this movie . I loved the characters , the offensive ( to many ) script , the well balanced comedy mixed with drama . This film moves you , makes you laugh , think , and truly has you wanting to reach into your television to strangle some if not everyone . Christina Ricci `` She 's the human tabloid . '' is all attitude and no graduate as DeeDee Truitt a 16 year old girl that refuses to grow a heart of gold even for us the veiwers . Thats cool we see that type of stuff everyday in the movies . After her stepfather kicks the bucket she decides to go and live with her brother . He , who is moaring his lovers death welcomes her . One might say that was a huge mistake on his part . She does little more than ruin his teaching career , steal his new boyfriend , gets him involved in a gay sex scandal involving a former student where he teaches ( thus , the reason for his almost termination ) , okay what else ... steals his dead lovers urn containing the mans ashes . Oh and thats just the half of it . Let 's finish this ... `` The Oppisite of sex '' is what DeeDee wants . SEX involves relationships , deceases , pregnanies and other complications in ones life . Who want 's that ? The film also addresses the survival of the species topic . It 's true if we did n't love sex ( complications aside ) we would have died out aeons ago . Good move on God 's part . This is a movie that can be enjoyed by adults that are n't easily offended .	1
Christina Ricci is marvelous as the sarcastic narrator of this witty , sly little film . Although the plot has a few not-so-plausible glitches , in my opinion , the cast , including Lyle Lovett and Lisa Kudrow , make the film a worth-while endeavor . Some of the one-liners in this movie are lost if you only give it the once over . It 's comedy that remains true to the characters ; its character sketches that are worth fleshing out ; and its multi-dimensional so it satisfies the audiences who may view it multiple times and discover tid-bits they missed the first time around . Intelligent and engaging , it should have found a broader audience ; it definitely has a broad appeal . It 's not only worth owning , it 's worth loaning to friends and family who may , just by looking at its packaging overlook it , but will watch it because you asked them to . They 'll thank you later .	1
This movie is so wickedly funny . Ricci is so talented , I just adore her as an actress . This one will make you laugh out loud and say `` oh no she did n't ! ''	1
A deliciously catty comedy that deserved all the acclaim it received when it was released theatrically . Christina Ricci takes the ball and runs with it in a signature performance as DeeDee Truitt , an acid-tongued teen who gets into all sorts of trouble when she moves in to live with her brother . The film is something of an acquired taste , and the humor may be a bit too racy for some . Already-established fans should definitely grab this one while first-time viewers might want to give this a rental to see if it 's their cup of tea .	1
American pop is one of the best animated movies ever . It tells the story of american music the characters stand out in a real way . The animation is great with the ww1 ww2 and prohibhittion being key parts for every gain something is lost the people change but the goal is the same for each generation . The 60s and 70s are shown to be dark and creepy . Great animation soundtrack and realistic story .	1
Along with Fritz The Cat and Heavy Traffic this is one of my favorites Bakshi has put out . Purposly historically inaccurate , but thats not the point of the film..it 's a film that uses music to tell the story of a family 's 4 generations from ragtime and ending with Bob Seger 's `` Night Moves '' . Being not a fan of most of the music in this film I still find it a very interesting film , and even I laughed at the mocking of punk using the Sex Pistol 's `` Pretty Vacant '' in a laughable manner . Definitly check this one out	1
At first , the dvd I bought did n't work , but then I returned it and got another copy in the mail within 36 hours , and it worked perfectly . Thanks Amazon for being so helpful , and expedient !	1
Ralph Bakshi created this 1981 Cult animated classic about the story of four generations gathered around the sound of American Pop music . Entertaining , provoking and all around awesome , one of the best animated movies i 've seen with The Last Unicorn , Heavy Metal , Rock and Rule , Akira , Ghost in the Shell , Ninja Scroll , Professional : Golgo 13 , Spawn , Mulan , Transformers : The Movie , ETC .	1
The famous film that had Capt . Queeg imitators on Tv for years underscoring Bogarts fine performance . The crew includes MacMurray , Johnson and Franz along with Tum Tully as the first capt . Jose Ferrer shines also and poses the rhetorical question & quot ; while you were doing your career & quot ; thing & quot ; ... guys like Capt Queeg were defending your way of life & quot ; Robert Francis is also a member of the crew ( also in The Long Grey Line ) made just a few filmsMeatball and Horrible ... ( lee Marvin and Claude Akins ) Tom Tully and Warner Anderson would team up again on the small screen .	1
It did take a while longer than expected , but it is well worth the wait . If you are a Bogie fan , this film is a must . Despite his temperament , this actor was well above his peers , and this is the reason for his immortality . Thanks !	1
This is truly a classic movie . Based on the novel by Herman Wouk , The Caine Mutiny is a good drama . The cast includes Van Johnson as the Exec . Is he a mutineer or did he save the ship ? Fred Macmurray is cast against type . Do n't look for My Three Sons here . Jose Ferrer is the defense attorney who has to save the career of Van Johnson . All of these are excellent performances but pale in comparison with Humphrey Bogart 's . He is totally believeable as Captain Queeg . Was he insane or just misunderstood ? Who was guilty of mutiny . Look for Lee Marvin , Jerry Paris and Claude Akins in supporting roles . This is excellent entertainment and should not be missed .	1
The Caine Mutiny is probably Humphrey Bogarts best movie . His acting , the story line and the production are beyond compare.The stresses that men go through in a combat situation are spelled out in this epic motion picture . The lack of comraderie bythe subordinates of the Captain and well as his inability to relate to others lead to the downfall of an entire crew in war timesituation . Outstanding in every respect , this movie can be enjoyed by all ages above 12 .	1
Of course by now , most avid movier-goers have seen this movie several times , but we keep re-watching because it is a classic with a great all-star cast : Humphrey Bogart as the breaking-down Captain Queeg ( also known as 'Old Yellowstain ' ) , Van Johnson , Robert Francis , Lee Marvin , Jose Ferrer , E.G . Marshall and Fred MacMurray , who eventually we find despicable and cowardly . Other reviewers have told the story , but the trial scene at the end of the movie is totally memorable . We will never again look at steel balls without thinking of Queeg - Bogart did a terrific job in capturing the essence of the character/movie . A great movie - a classic - always worth another watch , or buy one and add it to your film library .	1
I have watched this movie many times and I always wonder , `` Who won ? '' If you ever wanted to see a story about a contest of wills with no winner then watch this movie . It will make you think .	1
Humphrey Bogart , Fred McMurray , Robert Francis , and Jose Ferrer round out an extraordinary story on film . While the movie differs some from the book in various methods , the differences are soon forgetten when Bogart brings his acting prowess to the role of Captain Phillip F. Queeg . It was a gripping film , right up to the end and did n't disappoint as a seperate story . As other reviews mention , the book 's ending is quite different , but this movie is to be enjoyed without returning to Herman Wouk 's naval masterpiece . I highly recommend it to readers of the novel , however ... Bogart brings an excellent dynamic to Queeg .	1
There is a little bit of hokey acting by today 's standards , especially the boy-girl drama , but this is a very riveting film . The best scene of the movie is when the defendants ' lawyer goes to the party after he got his clients off on the mutiny charge . He rips into all of them . Do n't want to spoil it for you , but it is a very intense scene that makes all the hokey acting well worth it .	1
I had n't watched this film for many years , but recently bought and watched the DVD version . This movie is just as great now as it was when it came out in 1954.This film packs a tremendous amount into about 125 minutes -- a crisis of leadership , the testing of loyalty , and courtroom drama -- all done superlatively well . This is the tale of ordinary men who are tested in wartime by the fact that they are serving a captain who is a spectacularly bad leader . As almost everyone knows , this is the story of the events surrounding what amounts to a kind of mutiny aboard a US Navy destroyer during World War 2 in the Pacific . The events leading up to this , and the aftermath , are a great story that ranks with & quot ; Mutiny on the Bounty & quot ; as a naval classic . The story moves at a fast pace , never drags , features excellent acting , and the script is a wonderful adaptation of Herman Wouk 's novel of the same name.The movie merited seven Academy Award nominations , and the book a Pulitzer Prize , all for a very good and simple reason : this is a great story about ordinary men who are placed in a difficult and all-too-possible situation . It is difficult to say whether the aboard-ship portion of the movie , or the segment dealing with the trial , is the better . Both are superb . Jose Ferrer was absolutely magnificent as Barney Greenwald , and of course Humphrey Bogart was peerless as Captain Queeg . Van Johnson does well as the uncomplicated but competent Meryk . The rest of the cast turn in fine performances as well.Every movie afficianado will want to own this DVD and will enjoy this classic many times .	1
Edward Dmytryk directs this World War II classic with a late career stunning performance from the all time great Humphrey Bogart , - as the borderline insane Captain Queeg . An all star cast surrounds Bogie - Fred MacMurray , Van Johnson , Lee Marvin , Claude Atkins , and Jose Ferrer gives an outstanding acting display as the defending military lawyer . The ship is the CAINE , a battle scarred vessel that 's been around the block and then some with a crew consisting of combat fatigued veterans . The Caine 's Captain is replaced with Lt. Comdr . Queeg and the ships new captain believes that a Navy manual is every soldiers bible , strictly going by the book . Queeg starts to lose his faculties and his officers take notice , eventually planning a mutiny for the safety of the ship , - is the Captain losing it ? or was it just a wrong deception in judgement ? A classic ship adventure , 1954 . This 1985 VHS is an excellent transfer with a side opening cover for the tape . - was waiting for the fight at the end , no go .	1
Great reproduction of this wonderful movie . I saw it as a kid and loved it then . Probably one of the all time greatest films with a fabulous cast . Musical score is memorable .	1
Bogart is a giant of cinema , as everyone knows . What is often overlooked is that he truly was a very fine screen actor , and not only in tough guy roles either . As the barmy Captain Queeg ( who on earth dreamed up a name like that ? ) he loses his marbles with quite brilliant subtlety and one does end up by being genuinely sympathetic towards this man who has become paranoid through his inability to adapt to conditions around him . One must also praise the performance of Fred McMurray as the cowardly writer/officer who , having fomented the mutiny with his smart-alec witticisms and innuendoes among his brother officers , has n't the guts to tell the truth in the court-martial because of the damage it would do to him personally . Jos & eacute ; Ferrer as the defence attorney brings off his shrewd courtroom examination with memorable ruthlessness . As a study in the mental disintegration of a serving officer , and also in the damage that spite can do when manipulated by a scheming underling , this is a riveting film .	1
`` Aboard my ship , excellent performance is standard , standard performance is sub-standard , and sub-standard performance is not permitted to exist - that , I warn you . `` Based on the novel by the great Herman Wouk , THE CAINE MUTINY boasts one of the best performances and ensemble cast of any movie from the 1950s . Ensign Willie Keith , the nave young officer , is wonderfully played by Robert Francis , who died in a plane crash at the age of 25 one year after this role . Classic stars Humphrey Bogart , Van Johnson , Fred McMurray , Jose Ferrer , Tom Tully , and a bevy of talented and ( at the time ) lesser known stars ( including Lee Marvin and Claude Akins ) , round out this wonderfully diverse group of performers . They combine to paint a realistic portrait of life aboard the Caine - a tired , WWII ship desperately in need of leadership.The movie is essentially in three parts : The first part focuses on the arrival and experiences of young Ensign Keith , a son of privilege and wealth with an idealized view of the world and lofty expectations of those in command . He is discouraged by the presumed lethargy of his commander - the war weary Commander DeVriess , and yearns for a spit-and-polish type as a source of strength.In the second part , Ensign Keith get 's his wish ( or so he thinks ) in the form of Lt . Commander Philip Francis Queeg - a formal `` by-the-book '' man who is in reality , a battered veteran of one too-many combat experiences . Beautifully played by Humphrey Bogart , in one of his finest performances , Queeg is contrasted with the cynical communications officer ( played against type by Fred McMurray ) , the torn , yet devoted executive officer played by Van Johnson , and young Ensign Keith . Events escalate until the climactic mutiny , when the reluctant executive officer relieves the Captain.In the third part , the action shifts to the court martial of the offending officers . Jose Ferrer gives a brilliant and inspired performance as naval defender Barney Greenwald . While all main actors give splendid performances , Humphrey Bogart 's witness stand testimony shows the actors remarkable abilities . His transformation from confident and personable officer to a person of mental exhaustion displays Bogart 's considerable talents.The DVD sound and picture quality are excellent with the last reel properly remastered ( in comparison with the earlier VHS release ) . Extras include `` Inside The Caine Mutiny , '' a two-part documentary exploring the making of the film as well as specific themes and plot elements . The remaining extras - trailers for new films - are superfluous.The lessons of this fine film are loyalty , support , and respect for command . In the words of Jose Ferrer 's character in his exchange with young Ensign Keith : '' Now you 're learning , Willie . You do n't support your captain because you like him ; you support him because he 's got the job or you 're no good ! ''	1
`` The Caine Mutiny '' follows the story of the men aboard the minesweeper U.S.S Caine during the period of 1943-44 in the pacific war . After the Caine is assigned a new captain , Philip Queeg ( Humphrey Bogart ) , the officers begin to get suspicious at various acts that the captain does : His attention to small details such as shirttails and erratic behavior like rolling ball bearings in his hand when he 's nervous and the spouting of catchphrases like `` I kid you not '' . His behavior reaches a climax during a typhoon . Executive Officer Maryk ( Van Johnson ) , after being advised by some others , relieves the captain with the firm belief that the ship would founder with Queeg in charge . Now Maryk has to defend his actions in a court martial.It may seem surprising today , but at the time of this movie 's release , Jose Ferrer was one of the hottest actors around . He was already an Oscar winner for 1950 's `` Cyrano de Bergenac '' . Here , he plays Lt. Barney Greenwald , who is assigned to Maryk 's defense , but is n't so enthusiastic ( `` I 've read the preliminary investigation very carefully and I think that what you 've done stinks. '' ) . He came off to me as a competent defense attorney who was just waiting for the moment to strike . And although the evidence that backs up Queeg and goes against Maryk is overwhelming , Greenwald is able to break down Queeg in court , validating his instability and allowing Maryk to get off only with a reputation as a `` mutineer '' .My favorite performance is Fred MacMurray as Lieutenant Keefer , who does n't think too highly of the Caine , even being cynical towards it ( `` The first thing you 've got to learn about this ship is that she was designed by geniuses to be run by idiots . '' ) And , though not a psychologist himself , he is also the one who raises it to Maryk 's attention that Queeg may be nuts . Since he also contains hammering the idea at Maryk , it makes one assume that he would be willing to go all the way by alerting the top navy brass . But we soon learn that he is nothing but a scheming coward . He plants it in the men 's minds that the captain is crazy , yet has `` A yellow streak 15 miles wide '' . And when he is called to testify , `` He never even heard of Queeg '' as Greenwald remarks . At this point , we turn from disliking his cynicism to hating his guts . MacMurray , I thought , played this role so well and very convincingly . Surprisingly , he never got Oscar nominated for any of his performances . Perhaps the academy thought that this actor-who 's most well known as the father on `` My Three Sons '' and had a track record in light comedies- was n't prestigious enough to win the gold . It 's like his against type roles in `` Double Indemnity '' , `` The Apartment '' and this movie never existed ! In the beginning of the film , we tended to dislike Queeg because he 's a nut . He has the ship steam away from a combat mission , he orders no more movies to be shown , has constant practice drills and , when some strawberries turn up missing , has the ship searched and basically ripped apart in a futile search for a `` duplicate key to the icebox '' . But at the end , when Keefer 's plan is revealed , when sympathize with Queeg at how he was used and mistreated by his crew . For had the crew supported and helped the captain when he asked for it , things might have turned out different in the typhoon . This is one of Bogart 's better roles , maybe his last great one , and it netted him his last Oscar nomination . He made only about 3 or four other movies after this one , with the last , `` The Harder they Fall '' , being released in 1956 . In February 1957 , Bogart died of complications from throat cancer.If there is one problem with `` The Caine Mutiny '' , it is the romance plot between Ensign Keith ( Robert Francis ) and his girlfriend May , played by May ( Coincidental ? ) . Keith 's character is the first we are introduced too in the film . His involvement in the film is sort of like that of the newsreel reporter in `` Citizen Kane '' : He serves as a guide , a plot device to the events that follow . And only a handful of scenes are dedicated to Keith and May . However , these end up in the way of the much more exciting action involving Queeg and the other officers . I have read Herman Wouk 's novel and am aware that this was n't manufactured for the film , but was actually in the book ( And was the main plot , if I 'm not mistaken ) . This shows how much the screenwriters tried to remain faithful to the book . But the only way the movie could have been truly faithful to the novel would be if it had been two and a half or even three hours long . With a roughly two-hour movie , the writers should have figured out what was more important to focus on . If they had either dumped or worked out the romance plot better so it fit more into the plot , the movie would have been even better.Otherwise , `` The Caine Mutiny '' is a great film , one that many persons can find something to like . Naval buffs will enjoy beautiful shots filmed aboard naval destroyers at port and sea to represent the DMS Caine . Fans of court room dramas will find a very tense , well played one that 'll satisfy them ( Though a 1988 T.V movie , `` The Caine Mutiny court-martial '' , was said to do a better job . But having not seen that , I ca n't form an opinion ) . Bogie fans will most likely judge this one of his career highlights . And skeptics of Fred MacMurray 's talent will be put to rest . Add in a supporting cast that includes Tom Tully , E.G Marshall and Lee Marvin , you have great entertainment , I kid you not !	1
Director Ringo Lam and Executive Producer Roger Birmbaum bring us one of Jean-Claude Van Damme 's most adventurous , erotic thrillers . `` Maximum Risk '' is Van Damme at his maximum best . This high budget , lavishly produced , emotionally packed action film has a great plot with numerous chase scenes and daredevil stunts unfolding against a background of exotic locales . All are highlighted by a suspenseful score form Robert Folk.Van Damme is police officer Alain Moreau who is investigating the death of his estranged twin brother , Mikhail Suverov , in the South of France . His investigation leads him to New York City and his brother 's girlfriend , Alex Minetti ( model/actress Natasha Henstridge who was the alien femme fatale in `` Species '' ) . She works at a club operated by Russian mobsters . Mistaking Alain for his twin , the mobsters soon try to kill him . Corrupt FBI agents are using him to find a safe deposit box that can expose their illegal operations . Meanwhile , Moreau is falling in love with Alex . Held captive by Russian mobsters inside a hotel room , fearing for their lives , they make passionate love against the bathroom sink.Also hot on Moreau 's trail is Red Face ( Stefanos Miltsakakis ) , a blonde , muscular grim-faced hit man , who is an unstoppable fighting machine . They engage in sweaty hand-to-hand combat inside a burning Parisian office building ; they grapple with a knife in the cramp confines of a bank 's elevator ; and they kick box in a steamy Russian bath house . Famous for his bad guy persona , Miltsakakis has appeared in several of Van Damme 's films including `` Lionheart , '' `` Cyborg , '' and `` Derailed . '' He had a major role in `` Bloodsport : The Dark Kumite . `` `` Maximum Risk '' is a must have for fans of the `` Muscles from Brussels . '' If you 're not a fan , this is a great introductory film . After watching `` Maximum Risk , '' you will want to see more of Van Damme 's action adventures .	1
This movie did n't get enough credit in my opinion . Lots of action and a good story .	1
I am a fan of action movies , but I 've found some of Van Damme 's previous flicks ( most notably , Knock Off ) , to be below average . After seeing this movie on TV , however , I was quite impressed and ended up buying it.As with most action movies , this one features a hero ( Van Damme ) who has to kick some butt , aided by a beautiful girl ( Natasha Henstridge ) . The movie starts off with a pretty good car chase , followed by lots of scenes with guns firing and martial arts sequences . The plot is n't extensive -- Van Damme 's character 's twin brother is killed and he now assumes his twin 's identity , only to be hounded by the Russian mafia and corrupt FBI agents.I 've only seen the VHS version , so unfortunately I ca n't comment on the DVD sound and video quality . Nevertheless , this is a good standard action flick -- in my opinion , Van Damme 's best movie ( or at least it rivals Bloodsport ) , and I recommend it for any action movie fan .	1
Another twin movie , but without a twin . Yes ! Van Damme gets killed at the beginning of the movie and his twin brother fills his shoes to find out why he died . Natasha Henstridge pays tribute to the immortal that is Van Damme and helps him deliver major risky business ! Van Damme acts again for , the third time ? It 's a real exotic picture and it feels like a jacuzzi . Steamage ! Van Damme fights guys all over the world in this one . You could say 'same old , same old , ' but NO ! This movie has a fight in a fire and in an elevator where the bad guy gets stained toes . Ouch ! Cut back to the chase now , Van Damme and Henstridge make this movie work and it deserves to be purchased immediately .	1
Quality was excellent . Stars are handsome and beautiful . Locations are impressive . Direction is magical . Titillating . Download was easy . I 'm a happy customer .	1
Will you really connect with this movie . It was a great movie in it 's time . Generation Y may not appreciate it but it was a welcome reminiscence for us older timers .	1
This movie is action from start to finish a lot of crazy things in this movie rod Steiger is a crime boss got roped off and then ? ? ? ? ? ? But it 's good	1
This is a great movie . I love movies that have strong character actor parts . Everyone is alittle over the top and very entertaining .	1
It relaces a VHS copy that I had . It is a wonderful movie . If I did n't think is was great I would not have replaced it .	1
This is a solid comedy , with some good laughs and a great `` Godfather '' imitation by Marlon Brando , making fun of his previous role back in the '70s . My only complaint about this movie is too many misuses of God 's name , especially for a light-hearted comedy.It 's more than a comedy , really . It 's romance and drama , too , with some good messages and some bad ones , too , to be honest . Matthew Broderick and Penelope Ann Miller make a cute pair and these two were in the primes of their still-young career at the time of this filming . Bruno Kirby gives a memorable supporting performance , too . He plays a key figure early on , and then gives way to the rest of the cast.The story keeps you guessing all the way , with several twists including a big one near the end , even if it makes little sense when you think about it . The mixed messages and unlikelihood of most of things that happen here , are not to be taken seriously ... .just enjoyed for the entertainment value alone .	1
This is a wonderful movie to have in your collection , because your appreciation and enjoyment will be immediate , and continue to grow over time . It combines swift dialog , hilarious performances , well done running gags , and a great street-level view of New York . The humorous parodies are obvious and rich , and yet it 's wonderful to see Broderick 's character try and act as if he 's not -really- going through what he 's going through - - his efforts to remain aloof to the farce he 's embroiled in are truly wonderful . Performances from all other members of the cast are equally excellent . Not just Brando , but also Bruno Kirby ; Kirby has really done something fantastic in this movie , and I 've never seen him better . And Bert Parks ! ! Oh , my , who could have expected Bert Parks to do what he did ! ! Miss this one at your own risk .	1
I had watched this film years ago and recently purchased a copy after not seeing it for about a decade , a comical witty feel good film that was more complex then I had ever rembered . Never mean spirited always put a smile on your face and the feel good ending makes for a great under appreciated classic about a giant lizard , the godfather and a young freshman who are not what they seem . Great stuff !	1
If there has ever been a role that sould not have been reprised it was Marlon Brando 's one for the ages portrail of Vito Corleone in The Godfather . Yet Brando cleverly abd briliantly spoofs his classical performance in this movie . Almost as important is that the rest of the cast , Mathew Brodrick , Penelope Ann Miller , and especially Bruno Kirby , are not upstaged by Brando 's presence . If you are a Brando fan this movie is a must see . It does not really matter what the movie is about , just watch for Brando 's comic genius .	1
Marlon Brando stole the show here , but well acted by all.Watch for Maximilian Schell 's peculiar accent . He was not noted for comic roles .	1
This is one movie that , if you really look at it , is n't hilarious ... but , it 's funny in its own way ! It 's about a college fresham , Clark ( Matthew Broderick ) going to film college for the first time . When he is looking for the subway , he trips over a homeless man and gets helped up by some guy . The guy offers to drive him to the college and Clark finally agrees after some time . When they reach their destination , Clark gets out and goes to the trunk to wait for the guy to open it ... as soon as Clark is around , the guy drives away with all the stuff in the trunk . A while after he sees that same guy walking down the street and he chases , catches , and tells him to give his stuff back . The guy did n't have his money but MOST of his clothing . The guy told Clark that he could give him a job paying $ 500 a trip . That 's where Clark gets himself into trouble , not realizing what he was doing . This is a funny and cute movie . I would recommend this if you are bored and looking to watch a movie that 'll relax you .	1
Writer-director Andrew Bergman 's `` The Freshman '' ( 1990 ) would not exist without the inspired self-parody of Marlon Brando . The laughs generated by Brando and Matthew Broderick are priceless in this affectionate `` Godfather '' send-up . Engaging performances , a wealth of cinematic in-jokes and Bert Parks ! Classic Brando dialogue : `` Everything I say , by definition , is a promise . ''	1
This movie has interesting characters and one hell of a spoofy story line . A film school freshman , a little bit overplayed by Broderick , falls in with an organized crime family , which leads to some hilarious misadventures . All characters are funny , including the asinine professor of film who wants to be someone important . This is a nice , light comedy without excessive violence . If you never saw it , pick it up today .	1
I 'm a little unsure why people would see a movie such as this when they do n't like Feel Good movies in the first place . And then pan it because it IS what it is ? Rediculous.It 's fairly obvious from the blurbs what this movie is about . Cage and Fonda give convincing turns as nice people in a cynical world . While there are no real surprises in the plot , you ca n't help but be drawn into the story and find yourself rooting for the good guys . This is a good date movie , and someting to watch when you 'd like to restore your confidence in humanity .	1
This story was inspired by an actual event and makes you believe that there are still nice people in the world . One day a policeman ( Charlie Lang , played by Nicholas Cage ) must leave a restaurant in a hurry , and rather than leave without a tip he promises half the winnings of a lottery ticket to his waitress ( Yvonne Biasi , played by Bridget Fonda ) , if the ticket should win . The ticket wins , big time , and the conflict and stress begin.To contrast with the sweetness , though with a bit of cynical edge , of Charlie and Yvonne , is Charlie 's wife Muriel , obnoxiously and effectively played by Rosie Perez . Muriel is out for Muriel , and wants to get what she sees as hers , regardless of whatever promise Charlie may have made to Yvonne.We see Charlie conflicted as to what to do at first . After all , Charlie certainly did not expect to win several million dollars on that lottery ticket . However , Charlie wants to do the right thing , and he does . As Charlie follows his heart , and what he believes is right , Charlie comes to realize that Yvonne has morals and a style more like his own , and Muriel is greedy and conniving and just not a very nice person . While I was initially conflicted by Charlie 's marriage to Muriel , because I believe strongly in marriage , there came a point where I just could n't stand Muriel any more , and no belief in marriage would have made me stay with her.This story is a bit of a caricature and more than a bit trite , but somehow I wanted this variation on the Cinderella theme to work out and I had to follow it to the end . I wanted the movie to work out because Yvonne was just a wonderfully nice person and she deserved a better life , and I decided that no matter what Muriel and Charlie were not going to work out . I admit that I did come to the point where I wanted Charlie and Yvonne to get together , but I was not sure of exactly how to work that out without complications.In a way this movie is a bit of a guilty pleasure , because it does have a fair amount of predictability , though not all the details are predictable . However , I like to watch happy ending movies sometimes , and this one has a wonderfully happy ending . This movie works because of the great chemistry between Bridget Fonda and Nicholas Cage . The combination of their character 's believability , the sweet story , and the happy ending , just make this a fun movie to watch . Just keep your analysis of the story to a minimum ; it is only a movie , after all .	1
There are romantic comedies that you remember even years later for their wit , grace , and matchless chemistry of the leads . IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT comes to mind . Then there are those that are of a lesser order that you may remember vaguely a plot but not much else . IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is of this latter type . This is not to say that director Andrew Bergman did not manage to convey several heart-warming complexities that inevitably result when unexpected riches collide with everyday life.Nicholas Cage plays police officer Charley Lang , who does not have enough money for a tip for waitress Yvonne ( Bridget Fonda ) , but he does , however , have a Lotto ticket that he promises to split with her should he win . Naturally , he does win , and it is his winning of four million dollars that changes the tone from that of light comedy to the more bitter world of sleaze and greed . Charley 's wife , Muriel ( Rosie Perez ) epitomizes the grasping , totally self-absorbed woman whose true feelings for Charley are dwarfed by her need to have it all . There are some unnerving scenes of greed versus honesty played out in court that seem to validate the widespread belief that whenever huge sums of money are at stake , the participants had better get the details in writing . There are two areas of the film that do not ring true . The first is the unlikely pairing of the heartless Muriel with the heartfelt Charley . Muriel comes off as a female Murdstone from Dickens ' DAVID COPPERFIELD . Her antagonism towards Charley is unfathomable . Neither is her lack of acumen at hooking up with a man , following her divorce , who is even more of a golddigger than she is . The second is the saccharine ending that purports to show that the collective hearts of the Big Apple are big enough to force an ending that is sappy enough to let the audience sigh at a most unlikely resolution . IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU proves that though love may enable vast chasms to be crossed , human beings are more likely to retain that love if they remember why they fell in love in the first place .	1
One of my fondest childhood memories was to spend Christmas Eve sitting near a warm fire watching the annual screening of & quot ; Jason and the Argonauts & quot ; . As a teenager I stopped watching the film deciding that I had grown beyond it . A couple of years I rediscovered the film and found that I enjoyed as much as I ever did . All I need is to find a cabin somewhere in the wilds , take my DVD player up there and spend Christmas Eve as it was meant to be - next to a warm fire with & quot ; Jason ... & quot ; playing away.There is a sense of wonder and imagination to this film seldom echoed in the special fx epics of today , all bogged down with stupid ( rather than stupendous ) stunt sequences . This is good fun , highly enjoyable and a wonderful story.This is a good DVD transfer - the picture is excellent ( finally , the chance to see it in widescreen ) and the sound is good . If you remember this from your childhood and wondeer if it is as good now then let me assure you that it has lost none of its magic .	1
The ultimate movie experience of my adolescence was 'Jason And The Argonauts . ' I remember quite vividly the first time I saw it at the theatre in '63 at the age of eleven . It was at the long defunct Roxy Theatre in Whittier , CA in the old days when you paid to see a double feature . 'Jason ' was the main feature , who remembers the other movie . I do remember that my friend Gary and I wanted to see it again so I called my Dad to see if he would let us stay for the midnight viewing and pick us up when it was over . He agreed and we got to see it twice that night . It has been a favorite all these years.Believe it or not the magic of Ray Harryhausen 's stop-action special effects still holds up quite well after all these years and the storyline and acting was suprisingly good for a film of this genre which usually was concerned primarily with visuals and weak on dialogue . To this day my favorite sequences are those showing the Gods resting comfortably in Olympus viewing the affairs of man from a remote , aloof distance . If you bother to listen to their conversations you might be surprised to discover an amazing amount of depth in this mythological action/adventure film.Note : Unfortunately this DVD has been released only in a full screen version . This is not the way it was meant to be viewed , but for now we must endure with what has been made available .	1
These old movies tells us about our past too . It tell us what was going through a writer 's mind then .	1
Much-loved movie from everyone 's youth except mine ; I 've never seen it till now . The brilliant Harryhausen work was no surprise , nor was some awkward dubbing , but I thought the whole thing would be a lot more set-bound . Lots of great location work , especially in the scene w/ the Harpies . I liked Herrmann 's score better for 7TH VOYAGE , but that 's a quibble . 8/10	1
I appreciate the origin version of this film and the remakes of this film really , with the CGI crap , makes the remakes look less enjoyable to me	1
Special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen is perhaps the only technical person in the history of the film business to be treated as the primum mobile behind the films he worked on . In effect , to use the European cinema parlance- he was the auteur of his films ; the directors were utterly interchangeable . In fact , the only constant through many of his classics was producer Charles Schneer . This is most evidenced in the 1963 action and fantasy classic Jason And The Argonauts , part of the five film DVD collection The Fantastic Films Of Ray Harryhausen , Legendary Monster Series put out by Columbia Pictures.Technically , the film was directed by the notable non-notable director , Don Chaffey ( most famed for his later One Million Years B.C.- with Raquel Welch , and directing a few episodes of the classic tv show The Prisoner ) , with a paper-thin screenplay by writers Beverley Cross and Jan Read . But ... .so what ? Films like this utterly lack all pretense to being literate . There is nothing but quick moving plot , plot , plot , with a few tenuous scenes of character development early on . Yes , the film takes liberties with much of the mythos from Classical Greece- such as making Talos , the bronze statue , a Colossus , making Hercules a graying middle-aged man , and making the warriors summoned from the dead teeth of the Hydra , that Jason kills to get the famed Golden Fleece , skeletons , but this only enhances the camp effect . Plus , the breakneck sense of adventuring , plus the smug dalliances of the Olympic Gods from on high , perfectly echo the classical stories in their construction.And , let 's be honest , most of the great myths of yore were not known for realism nor character development , much less the nuances of narrative . Like the Harryhausen monster films- of which Jason And The Argonauts may be the best example ( if only because of the complexity of the stop motion animation ) , the ancient myths were pure thrill rides , where people fell in love at first sight , swore vengeance over the deaths of people they barely knew , and generally were guided by folly and hormones . That a few of their tellers added a bit of sex , heavyhanded psychological development , etc. , well ... .Perfect ! ... . The film does delve , however shallowly , into some deeper themes . As example , Jason is an Olympian agnostic , until Hermes delivers him to Zeus and Hera on Olympus . Yet , even there , he refuses Zeus 's help . He believes that a belief in fellow men is more important . Even Zeus seems resigned to the fate that he and the rest of the Olympians are doomed to fade away once all men adopt Jason 's attitudes . This , in turn , seems to be a spur to Zeus to throw extra dilemmas in Jason 's path , even as Jason seems to advocate a limited belief in free will.However , in such films , depth is a cherry on top , and there are , of course , things that make no logical sense ; such as how do the sailors rebuild the Argo , after Talos destroys it ? Where do their tools come from ? Why would the Colchins need to depend upon seven skeletons to battle Jason 's men when King Aetes has an army of hundreds or thousands ? Yet , do such things really matter ? Again , how many loose ends appear in myths from around the world ? And the film 's ending works because , again , it recaps the way the myths frenetically unwind , and then just end , often without morals . After all , now that Jason has gotten the Golden Fleece , his victory over Pelias is assured , and we do n't need to really see that . After all , the film 's title is Jason And The Argonauts , not The Revenge Of Jason . For , if it was , how the hell would he explain to the Argonauts his sudden fashion fetish for old time hockey masks ?	1
Watching 'Jason and the Argonauts ' brings childhood memories flooding back . I recall being wide eyed and mesmerised by this movie way back when I was a kid . Astonishingly I still enjoy this movie , and marvel at its atmospheric qualities . This really is one movie which showcases technical achievement . Given the fact that this was made in 1963 , it is technically brilliant . In my opinion the skeleton battle scene is one of the all time great animated action scenes of its type . Sure , it has been eclipsed many times since , and looks tacky now , but when considered in context with its year of production , it rates up there with & quot ; 2001 A Space Odyssey & quot ; as a movie ahead of its time . Greek mythology , coupled with dated , but fun animation , this is a classic movie deserving of a place in my DVD collection . Its a tribute to movie makers of old .	1
love these type moves.Good old fashion Pagan religion illustrated . I watched it several years ago and still like today .	1
The danger in using established material ( mythology ) as the basis for a film is that any deviation or disregard of the specific aspects of said material is bound to be noticed and unappreciated . That said this is a darn good film . Yes , it is a tad stodgy in parts , and some of the casting choices do n't make sense : Nigel Green as Hercules , Gary Raymond ( The Rat Patrol ) as Acastus , and Nancy Kovack as Medea ( her gimlet eye leads to several misinterpretations , none of them good ) . But there 's always the unrivaled artistry of Ray Harryhausen and the fantastic score by Bernard Herrmann to make up for a few shortcomings . The story moves quickly , some of it quite humorous ( the gods watching the earthly proceedings in a pool , in lieu of television ) . And it 's always a pleasure watching Honor Blackman ( Cathy Gale of The Avengers 1962 - 1964 ) in anything . For me , it 's a tossup for favorite scene : giant Talos or the sword fight with the seven skeletons . The Hydra 's also quite nice . Pity there was n't a sequel as Zeus suggests to Hera . I still maintain that Harryhausen did n't make nearly enough films .	1
I am writing this review having just read of the death of Ray Harryhausen . He is the person responsible for the special effects of this movie which is what makes this movie so great to watch . Yeah the acting is good . So was the script written for `` Jason and The Argonauts '' . Don Chaffey also did a good job of directing the movie . But it was the special effects that was developed by Harryhausen that makes `` Jason '' so great . Like a lot of other reviewers of this movie I first saw it as a young child and was fascinated by it and by the monsters , creatures and Greek Gods . I remember how chilling it was the first time I saw `` Jason '' and the scene where the army of skeletons came up from the ground with swords in hand ready to do battle with Jason and his men . Oh how that scared me ! Ray Harryhausen was inspired as a child by the movie `` King Kong '' . It would have a big impact on him . He would go on to get into movies developing the stop action photography special effect ( like was used in `` King Kong '' ) to create some of the most memorable films in movie history including along with `` Jason and The Argonauts '' is the 1981 version of `` Clash of The Titans '' , `` Mysterious Island '' and `` The Beast From 20,000 fathoms '' . This is no knock against any of the actors who starred in these movies but the creatures and dinosaurs Ray created for these movies are far more memorable and loved then the very best acting performance any actor could ever do . These movies are great because Harryhausen made them great.If you have n't seen this movie in years you owe it to yourself to get `` Jason and The Argonauts '' to add to your film collection . If you have never seen `` Jason '' then you owe it to yourself to get this movie and be drawn into the special effects world of Ray Harryhausen . It will be a world you will want to visit again and again .	1
Ray Harryhausen classic given a worthy Bluray transfer.Disc impresses way beyond my expectations.Classic movie that comes alive in H Def.Excellent ! ! ! !	1
I am a big fan of the Sinbad movies and this movie is no exception as it follows the same theme . I found all of the ones that I enjoyed when I was younger and still love to this day . Thanks Amazon for having such a wide variety of movies to choose from .	1
First of all , one of my all time favorite movies , a Harryhausen classic ! Movies used to be shot on film , which is made of grain and is present throughout all films . It 's Blu-ray 's job to make the picture as close to the original vision as possible , NOT to make it looks flawless.Take for example , the Predator Ultimate Hunter edition . They artificially scrubbed out all grain with Digital Noise reduction and in turn made all the characters look like wax figurines.I think this is an excellent transfer because Sony decided to preserve the original look of the film . Film IS grain !	1
My husband really is enjoying this movie , the sound and color is excellent , Thank you so much for this action enterainment .	1
What a great movie , I loved it since I was 8 and now I 'm 27 and I still love it , You must buy it ! ! !	1
Before movies used CGI to bring fantasy to life , there was a brilliant , and painstaking medium called `` Stop-Motion-Animation '' , where clay figures were posed and reposed ONE camera frame at a time , bringing life to an endless array of creatures and monsters , and Ray Harryhausen was the king of it all . Jason and the Argonauts is arguably Harryhausen 's greatest showcase of his innovative genius . This is the age-old tale of Jason , a fearless sailor and explorer , who is the rightful heir to the throne of Thessaly . To claim his birth-right , Jason must travel to the end of the world , and find the fabled Golden Fleece . A prize guarded by the deadly 7-headed Hydra . Jason 's adventure takes him and his Argonauts across the sea , to various lands , where he must overcome such obstacles as fighting a 100 foot bronze statue , outwitting deadly harpies , and a climactic final battle with a grave-risen skeleton army of the fallen 'Children of the Hydra ' . Filmed in Rome in 1961 , and released in 1963 , this is truly a masterpiece of cinematic magic , and a must-have for any fan of mythology , and classic fantasy adventure ! !	1
Almost every modern special-FX auteur worthy of a magazine interview seems to draw inspiration from someone named Harryhausen . I decided it was time to let curiosity get the better of me and rent this DVD from , gulp , 1963.Turns out it is an epic Greek adventure , with effects that must quite easily have made it the Lord of the Rings of the sixties . Only more creative , and let me tell you why.None of its effects are CGI , we were using computers the size of living rooms at the time . No , it makes do with stopmotion action models instead . They 're not half as bad as I had expected.Forty years hence the antics of its protagonists Jason and Hercules may seem rather commonplace as the ilk of Xena the Warrior Princess shake a similar jig on our weekly television shows , replete with all the spicy camp humor , but what absorbs us are the characters of the film 's mythic creatures that rise well above their inevitably pasty appearance.Given the context the acting is pretty non-cheesy and breathes life into fairly tenable set designs . The pace rumbles along just fine , and there 's even a stunning cameo from skeletons that defy the times they were created in . A dynamic yet unintrusive score rounds out the package rather nicely.Shed your reservations about old-hat action adventures , this is a great rental not only for gratification of nostalgic urges but as a testament to how grand films can be made with very little props from technology .	1
I forgot how impressive these special effects were . I saw this at a Drive-In when I was a kid and it 's just as cool now .	1
Classic Sci Fi great effects . The stop Motion effects revolutionized the whole movie industry . Ray Harryhausen was the genius behind those effects . Done on a shoestring budget , Harryhausen get 's the most out of his production	1
This telling of a classic fantasy is beautifully done , with all the supernatural dangers and eye-popping monsters you can handle . The search for the ram 's fleece of pure gold is spell-binding an ' non-stop ... Ray Harryhausen was at his very best with the stop-motion special effects ... for which the best description is & # 34 ; spectacular. & # 34 ; This was a childhood favorite of mine and I still delight in watching it ... the DVD is beautiful in full color and the transfer of all the special effects are excellent . One of the best at pure escapist fantasy - this movie will have you back in the far distant time of sorcery and magic ... a fun time for all ages ...	1
I am amazed at the people who called this predictable . There are so many twists and turns to the plot you can never be sure how it 's going to turn out . Yes , of course , the right people die at the end . You have to be pretty cynical to let that bore you . It 's standard American fare . ( Best selling books , films , TV -- not all stories can be like No Country for Old Men -- and even there the sheriff 's survival balances the protagonist 's death . ) But the way there is excellent . The acting is exceptional , except I have a great problem ( director , actress ) understanding what the hell Heche is saying . I 've never seen Alec Baldwin act so well . The editing is almost on a par with The Fugitive . Filming is excellent as well . Enough gore , but not overdone , as is so often the case in modern American film . The intelligence of the plot , i.e . themes , motifs , etc . is excellent as well .	1
DEMI MOORE AND ALEX BALDWIN MAKE A FINE CONTRAST IN THIS COURTROOM THRILLER WHICH REALLY TAKES PLACES OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM . THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLOT HAS GOOD SIDE ROADS WHICH HELP TO BUILD THE TENSION AND THEMES IN THE CHARACTERS . WELL DONE	1
This is one of my favorite movies . I recently went to a movie in the theater and the young man was so familiar to me and by the time I got home I realized he is the same person as Demi Moore 's son in this movie ! I 'm not a huge Demi Moore fan , this is one of three movies that I really thought she did a great job . Alec Baldwin is `` deadly charming '' ...	1
I really liked this one when it came out it was a differnt type movie than the regular ones . worth watching for sure .	1
This is one of the more faithful adaptations of a Philip K Dick story , though there are areas where it strays from the source material . These are more embellishment , however , and do n't really detract much from what is really an underrated , well-done , clautrophobic thriller . While the movie 's set on another planet , the story is set in Europe after a nuclear holocaust intended to stop the Russians from winning the Cold War . ( Incidentally , the bad guys in the movie are corporate lackeys , reflecting Hollywood 's current mores of loathing capitalist businessmen . ) Aside from that , though , the film is largely faithful to the Dick story with many scenes copying Dick blow-for-blow . The paranoia rampant throughout all of the best of Dick 's work is forcefully on display here and builds a relentless air of claustrophobic nightmare . The backdrop is effectively photographed and really adds to the intense moodiness prevalent throughout the story . Too , the acting , while not on the Wellesian level , is competent with the main actors giving fine , understated performances . Finally , the ending departs from the story , though not necessarily radically and serves add to an already well-made film . Recommended .	1
this is a good four star movie the ideas are new and its good action	1
Got for friend who orders through me . He is reluctant to order online , so I do it for him usually .	1
I have to admit , I had a lot of fun with this film ! Philip K. Dick '' s novels were a bit hit-and-miss ( `` Blade Runner '' , or `` Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep '' being the seminal novel of note ) , but this film , based on his novel `` The Second Variety '' , is soooo entertaining in a `` B '' movie kind of way.SPOILER ALERT ! ! X X X X X X X X X X X X X X XEarth has been divided into two camps : The New Economic Bloc and The Rebel Alliance . The NEB apparently has a `` slash and burn '' policy to space exploration , leaving dead wasteland in the wake of their search for power in the universe . The Rebel Alliance fights the NEB to stop their unchecked `` Scorched Earth '' policy.Enter into the fray one Col. Joseph Hendrickson , the Rebel Alliance commander on the planet Sirius 6B , an outpost in the hind-end of space , keeping the NEB in check , on Sirius 6B . Our good Colonel has a few nasty friends called `` Screamers '' , robotic mechanized Ginsu knives that protect the outpost.One fine sunny day , a transport ship crash-lands on Sirius 6B . Right on the doorstep ( literally ) of the Rebel Alliance outpost . The only survivor is a raw recruit with a deadly talent with small arms . Shortly after , an NEB soldier arrives at the outpost with a message for Col. Hendrickson . He does n't get very far , as the Screamers do to him what you might see at a Beni-Hana Restaurant ! PEACE ! The NEB wants peace on Sirius 6B ! ! The only catch is , the Colonel has to go to THEIR base ! Who better to go with , than a grunt who can drive tacks with any firearm you put in front of him ! On the way there , they run across a boy who apparently has survived alone for some time . Things are not as they seem , however , as the boy reveals himself to be a Screamer ! That is not the only surprise , as the boy does not care who 's side the Colonel happens to be on ! In their `` Evolutionary Drive '' , the Screamers have lost all memory of who they were fighting for . ALL humans are fair game.What transpires next is pure Philip K . Dick ! ! X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X XThere were moments in the film that were a little over-the-top , a few dead spots , too , but this is what makes Sci-fi so great , with a bit of `` technobabble '' , anything can be explained ( look at `` Star Trek '' ! They 're the worst offenders ! ) ! I particularly liked the Screamers , like little Happy Faces , or `` Pacmen '' with very sharp teeth ! If you are looking for some fun , entertaining Sci-fi , you could do worse than Screamers ! There is n't much in the way of extra features on the DVD , just the film . The transfer was done well , though .	1
El Mariachi is difficult to characterize , containing elements of action , comedy , romance , and drama at a non-stop pace . It is about the adventures/misadventures of a musician ( mariachi ) as he stops over a town in the wild west of Mexico and becomes entangled in its affairs . Although the movie was made on a shoestring budget of $ 7,000 , it does n't show in the movie -- for example , bullets do n't seem to cost anything -- except to make it seem more realistic and natural . This is definitely a classic , what I would dub as the `` Mexican Huck Finn . ''	1
Everyone I have talked to who has seen this movie says the same thing ; `` That was a really good movie ! '' . It is much more . This movie came out of John Singleton 's personal experiences with racism and crime in South Central , like Spike Lee with `` Do the Right Thing '' . But this movie was one of the first of many urban-crime films to come ( i.e . New Jack City , Juice , Menace II Society , Dead Presidents ) . Ice Cube , a rapper at the time , made his film debut as Doughboy , the drug dealer who does the most crime on the streets on South Central . Cuba Gooding , Jr. also made his debut as Tre , a man whose father ( Laurence Fishburne ) teaches him how to be responsible and making the right choices . The performances were great , The rare Soundtrack had cool songs like Cube 's `` South Central '' song and this movie is best of many crime films , not like the gangster films though.Singleton just put together the perfect movie to depict his old neighborhood , it 's just a shame that none of his recent work is as good as Boyz N The Hood . If you are a fan of gangster films , or just good movies in general , you will like Boyz N The Hood .	1
This is a great movie that speak to the people who been or live in the hood . not much has change	1
Awesome street gang movie . It reminded me of South Central , another great film . This movie takes you into the world of gangs in the US . From crack cocaine production/marijuana use and distribution to drive-by shootings , a car jacking and a toddler asking for a sip of alcohol from one of the OGs ( original gangster or old school founding member of a gang ) sitting on a porch . Spoiler Alert : Sad story as the ending is tragic . I wo n't go into details as I do n't want to ruin it for those who have not seen it . Must watch !	1
This film is great and classic . This is the best creation of John Singleton , nomitated for two oscars : director and writer , this is the film that started it all : inspired `` Do n't be a Menace '' and `` Grand Theft Auto San Andreas '' . This movie is WHORTH buying it ! ! ! One of the reviewers above said that the movie contains to many sterotypes , it 's not THAT true ! ! but I think he meant to the movie `` Do n't be a Menace '' .The stereotypes in this film are that the black people are VERY , VERY dangerous and few are educated ( this is even worst than the Hollywood movies ) , black people addicted to sex , black people always cursing and black people always hearing Hip Hop music ( this is one of the WORST and ANNOYING sterotypes ever ) .The movie is also blaming other people for the problems in the hood and I do n't understand why the `` N '' word is a horrible and racist word if they keep saying that all the time ! ! ! P.S : Do n't get me wrong ! This is one of the best movies I ever seen ! Im addicted to it ! ! ! and when I said that stuf abou Hip Hop I meant that not all the black people hear Hip Hop.ADIOS ! !	1
An exemplary directorial debut from John Singleton , who managed to create an American classic with his first effort.As we follow Tre Styles from childhood toward becoming a young adult ( as played effectively by Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) , and attempting to dodge , with the cautious guidance of his parents , the many dangers and risks associated with growing up in inner-city America , the sense of ever-present danger and , often , hopelessness associated with attempting to avoid falling into the cracks of society is abundantly clear.In the role of Tre 's troubled friend Dough Boy , Ice Cube is something of a revelation , and his balanced performance , alongside Singleton 's excellent script , prevent him from becoming merely another gangster caricature . Lawrence Fishburne and Morris Chestnut add further depth to a strong cast.All in all a very real , gritty depiction of the challenges faced at every turn by African American men and women in modern America . The building anger bristling beneath the surface in so many scenes is particularly resonant given the outburst of violence in the Rodney King Riots that took place in the very same city of the story just one year later.The film spawned several 'urban gang flick ' imitations in subsequent years , but most glorified violence and placed an emphasis on a loud soundtrack and sexual explicitness at the expense of strong plot-line , good character development and a serious social message . All three are to be found in Boyz N the Hood .	1
SAD THIS LETS YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS ALL EVEN THOU YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT IT .	1
Such a film is a masterpiece of realism and cynicism because realism is always cynical in front of evil , because that sadism here aims at showing the horror of black ghettos or urban projects in Los Angeles . It illustrates the fact that the vast majority of black murderers kill black victims . It is in fact the same thing as for white murderers and white victims . Who is the copy cat ? Or is it a rule that you murder one of your own ? In other words crime is not racist , not even racial , in its vast majority . It is nothing but the result of a social , cultural , ideological , economic and political situation that nurtures it . But the film provides absolutely no answer about that social situation . Cynical black cops who can only repress , even the innocent , when they do something at all , especially when that innocent is black , though most of the time these cops do nothing as for protecting the black community against the crime it feeds and raises in its own heart like a pet in a home . There is no hope except escape , go away as far as possible to free ourselves from the white plot that locks blacks together to produce a self-destructive boiling pot of a community , not even seeing it may be a time bomb that could harm the whole society when it explodes . It only wants to impress the audience with a fate , a fatality and create in its audience a feeling , emotion of total rejection based on disgust , maybe even hatred . But there is no hope anywhere in that film . No hope whatsoever.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne , University Paris 8 Saint Denis , University Paris 12 Cr & eacute ; teil , CEGID	1
The 1991 classic film `` Boyz N The Hood '' is an unforgettable masterpiece . `` Boyz N The Hood '' takes place in South Central , Los Angelas and is the story of 3 boys turning into men . The three friends , Tre , and Ricky and Doughboy , who are half brothers , have to deal with the harsh reality that is South Central and the consequences of their actions . Throughout the whole movie they deal with different choices to make in their lives and the effect of these certain choices . The movie is very touching , depressing , and can teach you a lesson all at the same time.You start out with Tre and some of his friends walking to school , and Tre ends up getting into a fight which lands him at his father 's doorstep , due to a written agreement between him and his mother . His father , Furious Styles , tries and successfully teaches Tre to be responsible and teaches him about things he will deal with throughout his life . Ricky and Doughboy , on the other hand , do n't really have anybody to teach them the ins and outs of life . This really has an affect on both of them later on in the movie . Doughboy , early in the movie , ends up in the pen at the early age of ten . 7 years pass , and Doughboy returns . It 's from here when the story really picks up . It takes you through the daily lives of all 3 , with Tre and Ricky trying to get into college and Doughboy hanging out all day on street corners with his friends . Toward the end of the movie , Tre 's endurance is definitely put to the test , along with everything his father tought him . The ending is a serious tearjerker , or atleast it was for me . To see what happens , you 'll have to rent it.The bonus DVD comes with a few cool extra features . It includes the awesome video `` Growing Up In The Hood '' by Compton 's Most Wanted . It also has a nice documentary on the movie . The documentary is lengthy , and very informative on how the movie came about . Audio commentary is included on the first disc , with John Singleton , the director , talking about different parts of the movie . He claims that most of what he used in the movie was taken from his own childhood . Alot that happened in the movie did happen to him , like his father raising him and teaching him about life . The picture is good , the sound is good , everything is brilliantly crafted in the drama . Cuba Gooding Jr. , Ice Cube , and Morris Chestnut do a good job at portraying Tre , Doughboy , and Ricky . Lawrence Fishburne and Angela Basset also do a good job at playing Tre 's mother and father . All of the actors did a fine job at playing their roles.So I say atleast rent the movie , if you 're still skeptical about it . It 's a great movie , and will definitely keep you in your seat the whole time the movie is playing . Everything is made wonderfully , there 's no doubt about it . However , if you 're easily offended by racial comments , I do n't think you need to watch this movie . Many racial comments are made about Caucasions , so like I said the easily offended should not view this movie . Other than that , this is a great movie that anybody could enjoy . It even adds jabs of humor throughout the movie , which kinda takes away from the drama a little bit . So , get this movie , it 'll be worth your money spent .	1
Of all the `` hood movies '' This is hands down the best . Many movies try to reflect the daily dramas that are played out in the urban war zones and ghettos of the `` Land of the Free '' . `` South Central '' , `` Menace to Society '' , and several others come to mind . But none of these others can compare to `` Boyz N The Hood '' .First off , you have a great , and talented cast . Fishbourn is terrific in his portrayel of a hard edged father who tries to raise his son right and teaches him to be a man in a harsh world . Cuba Gooding JR is incredible in his performance ( despite a few moments of obsurdity ) as Tre , the main character , who is the only kid in the hood to have a positive male role model . Ice cube does very good job as `` Dough Boy '' the bad *** of Tre 's friends.The story is also very good and is told well . We begin with Tre as a violent and disturbed young child living with his mother , who is then kicked out of his school for beating up other kids . His mother sends him to live with his father . We then see Tre and his friends grow up and dealing with the problems of young adult minorities in an urban environment.There are a lot of emotional parts to this movie and it aproaches the subject manner in a pretty mature fashion meant to impress the desparity of the Ghetto as well as what it 's like to try and grow up and survive there.Just like similar movies there is a significant amount of graphic violence , but I look at it as a more realistic depiction of the stories setting and characters . The difference with Boyz N The Hood is that it uses violence in a more responsible way , and there is less of it compared to say `` menace 2 society '' . The violence in the movie is n't just thrown in for fun or to show you some violence , but to impact you.Also there is a definate message of consequences of actions and the movie stresses the importence of making good choices , and doing the best you can even if the hand you are dealt is n't the best . In The end Tre prevails and is a good man , despite all the odds stacked against him.This movie really brought tears to my eyes and it was a fabulous , and disturbing look at the problems that America seems to pretend do n't exist . Watch this movie and it may even change the way you look at the world .	1
Thanks for sending the DVD in a timely manner and in excellent condition.RegardsRose	1

This movie explains to us the consequences of being in a gang as you would have found out if you saw the movie for yourself . A tight uplifting film that has a good storyline and some very good moments in it indeed . I would give this movie the BEST OF THE MONTH probably but definitely not the best of the year.VERY GOOD MOVIE A MUST SEE FOR YOU VIOLENCE TYPE PEOPLE	1
Branagh 's treatment of Frankenstein comes closer to the original tale than any other . The character studies of both the Monster and Frankenstein are rich in the telling and in the symbolism . The Monster is no green freak with bolts in his neck , he is a horribly disfigured , terribly crippled man capable of great tenderness and violence . Frankenstein is a well-intentioned scientist driven by grief and ambition beyond the limits of what his science can control . It is a lush Gothic cautionary tale about humanity 's regard and disregard for human life.This version of Frankenstein can not replace the great 1931 version , or any other fine treatments since then . Its goal is different : to tell the original Shelley story faithfully . In that , it succeeds marvellously .	1
Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein is a masterful motion picture . While it does take a few liberties with Shelley 's classic novel , it does a wonderful job of capturing the essence of the original story , specifically the humanity of the creature . While a little over-the-top at times and surprisingly gory , this film forcefully echoes Shelley 's philosophical , moral , and ethical questions , and by so doing redefines the creature in its original image . What I have always found to be the most crucial scenes in the story are here displayed in all of their troubling glory , and perhaps it is the heightened intellectual nature of this film that explains why a surprisingly large number of people find disappointment where I find stimulating triumph . There are enough horror-laden scenes to capture the attention of the general horror lover , but the real substance of this story , for those who prefer their monster to serve as a complicated , amoral representation of man himself , is ambrosia for those who are more fascinated by the questions Frankenstein raises than by the horrors he unleashes.The inspiration for young Victor Frankenstein 's obsession with conquering death is delineated pretty clearly , given its most intense emotional charge by the death of his doting mother while giving birth to his little brother . His time at university is a little rushed , however , strangely incorporating the influence of a mentor whose work Victor vows to complete ; where the older doctor halted his studies out of fear , Victor will push over the brink without hesitation . Victor 's lab is a bit overdone , featuring all manner of miscellaneous gizmos , vials , and wossnames that look impressive with blue bolts of electricity ( not generated by lightning , by the way ) pulsing through them . The monster , as we first meet him , is less than impressive , and a prolonged scene of Victor water-wrestling a guy wearing a patently fake body suit inserts a little unfortunate levity into what should be a most serious scene . Victor 's reaction to his creation is probably the weakest spot in an otherwise powerful film , as his sudden repudiation of everything he has ever worked for rings patently false.It is with the entrance of the monster , however , that this film truly begins to shine . Mary Shelley 's monster is not evil , nor is he a monster in the stereotypical sense by which he has come to be viewed by modern audiences . He is most definitely a victim and a creature deserving of much sympathy . Abandoned by his creator , his first interaction with mankind finds him fleeing a mob intent on hurting him for no reason apart from his ugliness . He takes shelter in a pigsty adjoined to a simple house in the country , and through a crack in the wall he not only learns to read and write , he gets to experience vicariously the joys and travails of family life . He becomes a guardian angel of sorts , secretly helping the family survive and prosper . At Christmas , in a truly touching scene , he finds a gift the family has left outside for their secret helper . One day , he gets a chance to actually interact with the blind old man of the house , sitting and conversing with another human for the first time in his wretched life , but all too quickly the family he had come to think of as his own , chases him away with blows and curses . If your heart does not break at the sight of the creature sobbing in the forest after this ultimate betrayal by mankind , you are the true monster . This whole scene is absolutely critical in terms of explaining who the monster is and why he does what he goes on to do , yet most film adaptations skip this scene entirely . Only now does the creature vow to seek revenge on the creator who abandoned him ; only now has this ultimate victim become a monster in the form of amoral man.The rest of the film is handled quite well , and Helena Bonham Carter is simply wonderful in her role as Victor 's significant other . The ending goes beyond the scope of the original novel , and it does so in a strikingly grisly way , but the overall effect of this film is true to Shelley 's original vision . Robert De Niro gives a particularly compelling performance as Frankenstein 's monster , the look and feel of the late eighteenth-century setting is spot on , and the musical soundtrack complements the plot extraordinarily well . While I would prefer to see a movie strictly faithful to Shelley 's novel , this exemplary albeit somewhat effusive adaptation hits the core messages of the story dead on and stands , in my opinion , as a truly impressive cinematic accomplishment .	1
I rented this movie in the hopes that , unlike the old nuts-and-bolts version , this version would give the acclaimed book its due credit . I was disappointed to find that it was a remake of the old movie , but it still housed many of the book 's themes and characters . Though many of the storylines were changed ( Clerval never is killed , and Elizabeth has her heart ripped out instead of being smothered ) , it still fit the movie very well . De Niro 's performance of the horrid creature flows well , while Branagh 's Victor seems a bit in-your-face at different points . As Always , Helena Bonham Carter is a joy to watch , and sexy Aidan Quinn is a winner by all costs as Walton , the ship captain to whom Victor tells his story . I give it an A- .	1
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT REMAKE OF A TERRIBLE OLD B & amp ; W FILM	1
All right , Frankenstein should be done exactly like this . Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to read the book . It has the sea captain everyone else decided to leave out of the movies . It has a monster that LOOKS like what Mary Shelley envisioned . Also , it does n't add anything to the original story but accepts Mary Shelley 's story as she wrote it without all the ridiculous trappings of the peasant mob , the windmill , and the namechnge for Frankenstein . People who downgrade this movie just do n't know what they 're talking about and need to read the book to see if Branagh did n't do better than James Whale at protraying Frankenstein .	1
This version of Frankenstein is the best since the original . It 's engrossing . You empathize with the Monster 's feelings , his longing for love and his pain .	1
This is a fantastic adaptation of the Frankenstein story , well crafted and told . Powerfully acted by all characters , especially Kenneth Branaugh and Robert De Niro as the main leads , with an awesome performance by Ron Hulce as Victors friend and confidante .	1
When Kenneth Branagh made & quot ; Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein & quot ; he had already established himself as a competent director within the horror/suspense genre with his stylish thriller & quot ; Dead Again & quot ; . With & quot ; Frankenstein & quot ; he went one step further , creating a wild and bloody film that made the critics and the audience somewhat uncomfortable . But while it is true that the film is intensely dramatic and theatrical , people forget that that is the very point . This is a gothic horror story , and just as with & quot ; Dead Again & quot ; , Branagh made a film that is very much steeped in its own genre . Wild camera-moves , operatic music and over-the-top acting is part of the charm of the piece , and if one can not accept that , then one should look for other forms of entertainment.That being said the film could still have been better . While the acting , the setting , the music and the cinematography is great , the script is just too rushed . The film moves very quickly and never gives you time to take a breather . You never get close to the characters and therefore the dramatic impact when something horrible happens to them is smaller . A few extra scenes showing us more character developement would have benefitted the film , I think . But overall , the main point of a film like this is to scare the hell out of people . And although Branagh manages to bring forth the central points of Shelley 's novel , it is the horror in which he excels . A good scare .	1
Both one of the most horror-oriented and one of the most thought-provoking versions of the often-filmed tale , `` Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein '' brings together a great cast - spearheaded by Robert DeNiro as the Monster and Kenneth Brannagh as Victor Von Frankenstein - for a big , epic production . It features stunning visual imagery and grand atmosphere , and some truly haunting quotes from the Monster . The Monster is perhaps the best developed here of all his screen appearances , a brilliant and sensitive soul being consumed by the rage and darkness inside his artificial being . Rarely has the picture of a monster 's brutality being shaped by the world it 's found itself thrust into been handled so brilliantly , and the overall attributes of the creature this brutality grows in - superhuman strength , a slowly emerging genius intellect , powerful emotions the creature has never had the chance to learn to control ( having been 'born ' fully grown ) , unnatural resistance to injury and heightened endurance , etc . - makes for a frightening force . Victor Von Frankenstein 's portrayal is not one of a man who conciously chose to ignore the moral considerations and responsibilities of what he 's doing , but a man upon whom such concerns simply never dawned for a second , until he 's face to face with the consequences of his actions and it 's too late for second thoughts . This has been said of the Frankenstein tale time and time again , but it continues to hold up : this story gets more eerily relevant to the modern world with each passing year.It 's among the career highlights for everyone involved , and with not only heavyweights DeNiro and Brannagh onboard but also such excellent talent as Helena Bonham Carter , John Cleese ( in a rare non-comedic role ) , Francis Ford Coppola and Frank Darabont ( director of `` The Green Mile '' and `` Buried Alive '' , among others ) , that 's saying a lot . Excellnt movie ; one of 1994 's best	1
While Mary Shelley 's novel asks the question of who 's the monster and who 's the hero , most movie adaptations make Frankenstein 's creation to be the clear-cut monster . But Kenneth Branagh 's adaptation of the beloved classic is the DEFINITIVE film adaptation of & quot ; Frankenstein. & quot ; There is no clear-cut & quot ; good guy & quot ; or & quot ; bad guy. & quot ; Robert de Niro gives a gritty yet insightful performance as the & quot ; monster. & quot ; Branagh once again achieves brilliance as actor and director , crafting a visually-stunning and emotionally-charged masterpiece ! Branagh fans will not be dissapointed ! Grade : A+	1
a perfect adaptation that lives up to the spirit of the novel.I really think Mary Shelley would be proud .	1
Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein is a refreshing trip back to the late 18th century , and how science was evolving as man 's curiosity takes the place of rational thinking . Here we have Robert DeNiro playing the monster , and he turns in a respectable performance . I thought all of the acting in this movie was generally good , and the environments really brought the novel to life . Sure , the writers put their own spin on a few scenes ( which I do n't want to mention and therefore spoil ) , but it adds to the overall feel of the movie . The monster is a bit human-like , but I think that it was a deliberate attempt to depict Frankenstein as a more intelligent and tangible being . There are quite a few graphic scenes , but then again , what does one expect from an intense story like this ? This movie is filled with emotion , which is one of its strongest points . Overall , a very watchable movie that does the novel some justice .	1
... if that was n't one of the better , more memorable lines in any movie made in the 90 's ... And that line encapsulates the story , which is essentially the story of an incredibly interesting , accomplished , and intelligent man who 's fears dominate him to such an extent that the viewer sees the exact opposite through most of the film.The movie documents the transformitive effect that human caring can have as an element of value in life that trancends the material . Nicholson plays a man who has the money , the success , the perfectly organized enviroment , but is completely devoid of companionship.When introduced ; as it is both in his relationship with his neighbor ( through his beautiful dog ... which happens to be a Brussels Griffon to anyone curious ) or Helen Hunt , his waitress , the threat in needing companionship ushers all kinds of wild and comedic turmoil , but in the end ... well , I wo n't spoil it for those who have yet to view.And to that class of people , who have yet to see this film , count yourself lucky , it 's a beautiful comedy about love , and it 's power to help man triumph over fear . To those of you who have seen this and are considering buying the movie , I recommend you do . It 's one of the few in my collection that I frequently watch and enjoy.Christian Hunter	1
What do you get when you combine a Depressed-Homosexual , an Over-Protective-Single-Mother , and a Tactless-Homophobic-Obsessive Compulsive ? Well , if it has superb acting and an original script , then it is & quot ; As Good as it Gets & quot ; .So what if the story is a stretch ? So what if Jack Nicholson is , well , Jack Nicholson ? This movie surprises and entertains throughout . Is n't that what they are supposed to do ? & quot ; As Good as it Gets & quot ; has a wonderfully original script . The three primary players gel into a perfect team . You never know what Nicholson will say next and this trait is found in all the characters of the story . My absolute favorite scene , is the & quot ; Hospital Scene. & quot ; It is pure comic genius on a very human level.Rent it , buy it , borrow it or steal it . But you have to see for yourself . You may just find yourself a new favorite & quot ; Romantic Comedy. & quot ; The DVD has the standard extras , complete with a commentary version . Missing however is the movie Trailer .	1
If you 've never seen a Jack Nicholson film , or have been repulsed by some of his previous flicks , GO SEE THIS FILM ! ! ! It is a cinema classic . Helen Hunt is so sincere , hard , and cute ... in this film that reminds me of a Spielberg classic . It tugs at the strings of your heart .	1
All you can say is BRAVO ! ! this movie was awesome ! all the actors did a great job . they couldnt hvae picked any other people to do the job Jack Nickleson and Helen HUnt did ! Man ever since this movie i have been a big Helen Hunt fan ! she is a great actress and people who say she 's not feminine are just plain crazy . I dont see how anyone can see that ! ! ! ! and another thing i have read alot and some peopel think she is not a very good actress ! well if she wasnt a very good one then why would there be such A demand for her ! well i know everyone has there own feelings about this movie but i dont see how anyone could not like it ! ! it was one of the best movies i have ever seen ! But thats just me ! and i think Helen and jack deserved there awards they really did a breath taking proformance ! ! well that is just my feeling on the movie ! ! !	1
The darkness is very much present . In Melvin 's personality traits . In Simon 's relationship ( or lack thereof ) with his parents , in the vicious assault he 's a victim of . In Carol 's & quot ; dawn patrols & quot ; and later on in her desperate search for & quot ; something & quot ; , for love , for a & quot ; boyfriend that does n't go crazy on her ! & quot ; ... You might almost mistake it for a romantic comedy , all the occasional light touches are there . But what sets this apart from stereotypical lightness , and indeed from stereotypical darkness , are the actors . Jack , Helen , Greg , Shirley ( and Jill ) - you were sublime in this one ! ( script & amp ; director huge help , as well ... )	1
This is truly Jack Nicholson at his best . Both he and the dog take the movie ( spoiler - they both have OCD !	1
Brilliantly written , brilliantly acted and cleanly directed , this strange and wonderful tale is one of the best romantic comedies ever to hit the silver screen . Helen Hunt , as an unmarried thirtysomething waitress with a asthmatic five-year-old boy , is exquisite . Jack Nicholson , as a weird and mean obsessive/compulsive writer named Melvin Udall , is even better than he usually is , and he is one of the great actors of our time , and even Greg Kinnear in a supporting role as the sensitive gay guy next door is outstanding.Of course I love impossible love , unrequited love , love that takes decades to culmination . This is a case of impossible love come true . Eat your heart out Nora Ephron ! And you too Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks . But I could n't help but think , considering the principals , how impossible it really is on another level . But never mind , in fact , all the better.James L. Brooks , who directed and who , along with Mark Andrus ( from his story ) wrote the script , is to be highly commended . The concept of an obsessive/compulsive , self-centered ( almost autistic ) older guy , set in his ways beyond anything normal finding love is just wondrous strange . And a patient and caring , under-achieving , under-appreciated Manhattan waitress in a house dress , finding not just love but somebody who really knows who she is and what she 's worth is also just wonderful.Wonderful , yes . A wonderful movie to lift the spirit . But As Good As It Gets is more than that . The dialogue is sharp and witty and big-city sophisticated and sometimes laugh out loud funny . The underlying statements about relationships and love in urban America are subtle and thought-provoking . So much is said beside the point . Yes , off to the side we find some street hustlers juxtaposed with someone sensitive , and we see how irrelevant they are and how he overcomes them and this brutal thing they have done to him . And off to the side we see again how irrelevant is the homophobia of a man lost in prejudice and self-hatred , and how it changes when he becomes aware and when he learns to love.The ancient rule in comedy , from the Greeks to Shakespeare to the musical comedy of the stage to the romantic comedies of the silver screen , has been young and attractive principals overcome obstacles and live happily ever after . Here we have obstacles of the most tiring sort , obstacles not of class or race or family , but of psychological problems , stuff straight out of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- although to be technical , the symptoms of Melvin Udall are a cornucopia of psychiatric delight . The bitter , cutting , hateful insults that he showers on everyone , even his most devoted admirers , seem more characteristic of Tourette 's Syndrome than of a obsessive/compulsive disorder . But never mind . It works . In fact everything works in this movie , from the adorable little dog whom Melvin loves ( & quot ; A dog ... a blanky-blanky dog ! & quot ; [ who has captured his heart ] he tells us in amazement ) , to Greg Kinnear 's character 's friend ( Cuba Gooding ) trying to act tough , to Shirley Knight in a bit part as Helen Hunt 's character 's mother , to the cute little boy with asthma.However -- and this is a big however -- this movie is not for everybody , which accounts for some of the nasty reviews below . But ignore them . Trust me . This is a wonderful movie , although perhaps not for those who are homophobic or 13-years-old .	1
Jack Nicholson continues his trend of being the best actor in Hollywood with the brilliant story by James Brooks ( the & quot ; Cheers & quot ; guy ) and superb performances by Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear to aid him . At times , the characters find themselves in ultimately AWKWARD situations ... this is something that we do n't see much of in Hollywood anymore with the advent of characters who ALWAYS know just how to interact with each other . Nicholson is grand as an obsessive-compulsive while Kinnear has the 'homosexual neighbor ' bit down to perfection . If you 're looking for a comedy/drama/awkward romance , you 're probably seeking a one-of-a-kind film ... and this is it .	1
Over the years I have been amazed at the ability of Jack Nicholson to successfully play such a wide range of characters . This is as true of his role as Melvin , a misanthrope with a severe case of OCD , in `` As Good as it Gets , '' as it is of any of his other starring roles.At the start we find Melvin , a highly reclusive though extremely successful author , living alone in an apartment . His one real problem ( beyond his OCD ) is Simon ( Greg Kinnear ) , his gay neighbor who has an annoying little dog whom Melvin hates . Melvin 's only meaningful activity outside his apartment is to eat breakfast at a local cafe , where he insists on being served by Carol ( Helen Hunt ) , a single mom who is eking out a living on her wages and tips.Over time Melvin finds himself increasingly attracted to Carol , and when she leaves her job at the cafe he tracks her down . Eventually he becomes romantically involved with her , despite the extreme discomfort this causes him because of his OCD.Although the movie is billed as a comedy and does have its funny moments , it is far more profound and poignant than is the typical comedy . Along with the excellent acting on the part of both Nicholson and Hunt , it accurately portrays the extremely debilitating nature of OCD as well as the difficulty of trying to overcome it .	1
Of course , I 'm extremely biased because Jack Nicholson is my all-time favorite actor , and I have only seen one movie with him in it that was less than stellar , and that was Wolf . Well , this movie is FAR from that . As far as I 'm concerned , this is probably his FUNNIEST and best movie yet ! Every time I watch this ( and I 've seen it upwards of 50 times ) , I laugh so hard that I almost , well ... ..you get the idea . Anyways , I ca n't stress this enough ... ... BUY THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
This is a great film that has been around for more than 15 years . The blu-ray version , although far more expensive than most other films of this category , is worth buying if you are really interested in high definition . The image quality , in terms of clarity and colours is far superior to the DVD version . The sound is also greatly improved . To appreciate these refinements , you will need high quality audio-visual reproduction equipment to play the disc . These refinements will not became so apparent on a common television set and a cheap blu-ray player . What is also nice about this limited edition is that it contains a brief booklet . It is full of stills from the film itself and contains a nice and informative article about this film written by Julie Kirgo .	1
This is a great movie . It is a great romantic comedy with the main character , played by Jack Nicholson , has OCD . It is sad/dramatic at times but overall it is pretty amusing . I think the best actor in the entire movie is the dog . The dog is just amazing . I absolutely love this movie and have watched it over a dozen times . It never gets old .	1
It 's no wonder this movie won so many Oscars ! The acting is superb , the plot line impeccable and the writing of the one liners such as , `` I 'm drowning in the water and your describing it . '' Are hysterical . Even the dog is funny.This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and you ca n't miss this one . You will fall in love with Jack Nicholson 's character ( he plays an obsessive compulsive ) , Helen Hunt is at her finest and Greg Kinnear is a hidden gem . Not to mention oh lala the ever gorgeous Cuba Gooding , Jr.Every role shines , from the small ones to the big .	1
Nicholson at his comedic best ! Love the show and the cast , well written and executed . Great addition to any collection !	1
Lots of movies I liked pretty well the first time I saw them were n't nearly as appealing when I see them again some years later.I recently saw this movie for the third time on DVD , and darn if it does n't get more delicious every time.The writing is so crisp it snaps . The acting is so pleasurable it 's like being ring-side at a 3-ring circus . The direction , photography , set design , art direction , etc.I hear often in recent reviews that Jack Nicholson is given roles where he gets , essentially , to play Jack Nicholson . This is not to imply that Jack is any flavor of heartless romance writer with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - but it means that the & quot ; Jack & quot ; we get to see in this movie seems a good guy to spend 2 hours with . Helen Hunt , Cuba Gooding , Jr and Greg Kinnear make perfect stand-ins for our desire to & quot ; hang out with Jack & quot ; .This is the movie that & quot ; Something 's Got ta Give & quot ; desperately wants to be - yet this film exceeds that more recent work by pretty much every measurable marker.I 'll watch this film probably once a year as long as I live . The one time I saw Something 's Got ta Give was enough .	1
IN THIS COMEDY/DRAMA , A WRITER [ JACK NICHOLSON ] BECOMES INVOLVED IN THE LIVES OF HIS FAVORITE WAITRESS [ HELEN HUNT ] AND HIS GAY NEIGHBOR [ GREG KINNEAR ] . ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC MOVIE THAT 'LL MAKE YOU WAN NA LAUGH AND CRY . THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN JACK NICHOLSON AND HELEN HUNT IS JUST OUTSTANDING . EXTREMELY GOOD PERFORMANCES FROM EVERYONE , AND A VERY GOOD STORY THAT 'S FILLED WITH COMEDY , DRAMA , AND ROMANCE . THIS IS A PERFECT MOVIE FOR ANYONE THAT LIKES TO LAUGH OR CRY . EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF JACK NICHOLSON , YOU SHOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE NONETHELESS . JACK NICHOLSON AND HELEN HUNT BOTH WON OSCARS FOR THEIR PERFORMANCES .	1
If your a fan of Jack like I am this movie will not disappoint you I recommend watching it even if you do n't buy it .	1
One of the finest romantic comedies ever made ! The entire cast is excellent in this well written tale of love that is not so perfect . The movie deals with much more than an impossible romance and is sharp , blunt , and clever in it 's execution of many social issues . This movie should be seen by all movie lovers even if you do n't like `` romantic comedies '' . The DVD transfer is good and you can find this is the bargain bins for $ 5.00 ! ... ..A bargain indeed !	1
Hard to think that people are not all perfect , but are still worth love . This takes a look at bizarre personality traits that still can focus on love . I am not the best fan of either of these actors but they did a great job with what I imagine is a more realistic plot than the chick flick movies .	1
Jacl Nicholson in in a world of his own . At times I do n't think he 's acting . Greg Kinnear was great as was Helen Hunt . A well-done , poignant and adult movie . I would recommend it to all -- male and female . Caveat : liking Jack Nicholson helps a lot .	1
As Good As it Gets was one of the best films of 1997 . Jack Nicholson serves up one of his best roles yet , and Helen Hunt is excellent . Greg Kinnear perhaps has the best performance of all , yet went unrewarded . The characters are well rounded and flawed , and the interaction is very realistic . The DVD is beautifully transferred , but the commentary is very dry . Definitely a nice edition of the film , but the extras are nothing special .	1
This is essentially a good movie that is graced by an absolutely stellar performance by one of America 's great film actors . Jack Nicholson has had several performances as memorable as this one , but he has never had one that was appreciably better . As the child of an intensely obsessive-compulsive father , his performance especially hit home with me ( as I was watching this movie with my daughter , I asked her , `` Does Jack Nicholson remind you of anyone ? '' and she immediately shouted , `` Grandpa ! -- out of the mouth of babes ) .The brilliant thing about this movie is that it does n't just stop with a character with a serious social-psychological problem , but deals with his attempts to break out of his mental prison to engage in normal relationships . Partly this is done through his unexpected relationship with a neighbor 's small dog . Partly this is achieved by what is initially a selfish concern with the difficulties of a waitress with a son with serious health problems ( selfish because her absence from the restaurant to deal with her son 's health problems upsets his dining routine ; he would rather pay out money to help her son than have her miss taking his order for his meal ) . Gradually , however , he develops a concern for the waitress ( Helen Hunt ) not merely as the woman who takes his orders , but as a human being . Eventually , in his own highly limited way , he sorta , kinda falls in love , to a degree that he is able to utter one of the most romantic lines I have heard in a film : `` You make me wish I was a better man . '' He is n't a better man ; he is n't even an especially desirable match . But she is able to accept his affection , with all his limitations as a person . It is n't the Disney version , but it is all rather lovely.The cast is by and large excellent . Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for their performances . I did n't care for Cuba Gooding Jr. 's rather campy gay character , though I suspect the problem was more in the way his part was written than in his performance . I thought Greg Kinnear was OK as a gay artist and neighbor to Nicholson ( in addition to being the owner of the dog ) , but like Gooding , I could never really accept him as being gay . But the picture is carried by two superb performances by Nicholson and Hunt .	1
This is probably the last best role for Jack Nicholson . Enjoy him ! This is a fun movie with a timeless message to accept people where they are at and to enjoy life as it comes along .	1
Classic film . Reminds me of the solid , classic films from the 1950 's . This is perhaps the only film I enjoy Helen Hunt . She is outstanding . Jack Nicholson is divine . Verdeel , the dog , is the star . The ending is believable , and still amazing . Watch it if you love old films . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
finally released on blu ray . loved this movie when it was first released and bought it on laserdisc at the time.bluray has excellent pq and it is worth upgrading . price is high , but the movie has never looked this good before	1
The art of the confidence game , or con , for short ... very few manage to bring it to the screen as well or a clever as David Mamet , and The Spanish Prisoner ( 1997 ) is , while not in my opinion his best , but better than most , and certainly is a good display of Mamet 's writing and style for direction . Written and directed by Mamet ( House of Games , Glengarry Glen Ross , Wag the Dog ) , the film stars Campbell Scott , Steve Martin , Ben Gazzara , and Rebecca Pidgeon ( who 's married to Mamet ) .Scott plays Joseph Ross , an inventor who creates a top secret mathematical formula of sorts intended to allow for the manipulation of the stock market somehow , and has the potential to make a lot , a whole lot , of money for the company he works for ... problem is Ross is beginning to have doubts about receiving his fair share , what he believes he 's entitled to , from the company that plans to utilize the formula . As he tries to negotiate an equitable agreement with the company , he meets a well to do businessman by the name of Julian ` Jimmy ' Dell ( Martin ) to which they become friendly , with Jimmy even offering to assist Joseph by putting him in contact with a lawyer that deals with contract law and proprietary information . But nothing is what it seems in this film , as Joseph soon learns as he 's accused of theft of the formula , and even murder , as evidence begins appearing that certainly points the finger at him , becoming the perfect patsy . Will he be able to fully understand the intricacies of the con and learn who 's involved before he captured by the police and/or FBI ? I know , but you 'll just have to watch to find out ... I really enjoyed this film , and all its ' intricate twists and turns . It 's difficult to talk about without giving anything away , but the story is truly a wonderful mystery that will keep you guessing until the end , even if you manage to uncover some of the elements for yourself . The crafting of the con within the story is really good , even though we see so very little of the machinations and planning behind it , instead seeing only the end results , as Scott 's character is drawn into a world of fabrication , deceit , and lies . My favorite role here was the character played by Steve Martin . I thought he did an excellent job presenting a charming and sophisticated character , playing the rare serious role . I do enjoy many of his comedic roles , but it 's always a treat to see an actor successfully break out of his/her element and show they are more than what we see on the surface . Scott was good , although I felt his character was just a bit too gullible at times , especially given the nature of his work . I 've never really cared for him much as an actor as he reminds me too much of that lame white guy from the 3rd season of MTV 's The Real World ( I think his name was Judd ) . He was such a smarmy , wishy washy annoyance always following the majority , trying to present an image of the understanding , evolved , sophisticated , yet oh-so-sensitive male in touch with his feminine side , ever careful never to appear politically incorrect for fear of being offensive to the viewers on the other end of the camera , spouting meaningless phrases that make you want to punch him in the face like `` I feel your pain '' , or `` Why ca n't we all just get along ? '' but I digress ... A couple of things about Mamet 's movies , sort of his signatures to me , is the direction by Mamet giving the film the feel of not so much watching a film but of watching a play on film unfold outside of a stage and also the often times odd dialogue spoken throughout by a number of lead characters . I think the latter element is what may put some viewers off , as it can sound very unrealistic and sometime contrived . I mean have you ever heard anyone say , `` Worry is like interest paid in advance on a debt that never comes due '' ? It sounds nice , but I know of no one in real life that talks like this , spouting strange and introspective statements off the cuff ( you could catch a beating in my neighborhood for doing so ) . I suppose the character played by Rebecca Pidgeon had the most noticeably odd lines , especially seeming out of her character . Maybe these looked good on paper , but I feel it takes a really good actor to pull them off on screen , and make them sound natural . I like Rebecca Pidgeon , as she 's very sexy in a demure way and , I believe , a capable actress , but I felt she was n't able to pull off some of the lines she was given here , within the context of her character.The picture presented here looks very clear and crisp , and the disc is two sided , with a wide screen version on one side , and full screen format on the other . I did feel the audio was a bit soft , but English subtitles are available . I did find the subtitles did n't always match exactly what was spoken , and I thought that a little weird . Not much here with regards to special features other than a theatrical trailer and brief production notes on the insert inside the DVD.Overall , I think The Spanish Prisoner is a very good , low-key mystery thriller that will keep you on your toes until the end and does have replay value if only to better understand the layered complexities within the story ( I 've seen it twice ) , but I still feel a better Mamet film to watch is the first he wrote and directed in House of Games , with Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna.Cookieman108	1
The Spanish Prisoner is in a league of its own . Not only is it one of the better mysteries of the decade , but it also achieves such without violence , sex , or profanity . Not that I 'm against those mind you , as long as they are there to benefit the plot , and not just for show . What I mean to say rather , that it is astonishing to watch such an absorbing film , and then by the end of it all realize that it did it without traits mentioned above . Much like the Usual Suspects , this film plays with your mind . You are taken on a rollercoaster . Who can you trust ? The acting is dead on perfect . Campell Scott is good as the unexciting man in the middle of it all . And believe it or not Steve Martin is perfect in his role . So if you 're looking for a good brainteaser , I reccomend this one . Also , look for a cameo by Ed O'Neil , better known as TV 's Al Bundy .	1
A modern day film noir in the tradition of China Town and L.A . Confidential . Spanish Prisoner possesses a unique style that is missing from most movies today . Intriguing sets and locales , a winding plot , sophisticated characters , and a moody , mysterious tone throughout the entire film set this movie apart . True , as some reviewers have complained , the acting is somewhat understated , but the dialogue is intelligent and lends itself perfectly to the mood that Mamet is trying to create . If you 're looking for explosions , gratuitous violence , product endorsements or cheaky one-liners , then this movie is not for you .	1
This is a favorite , a man invents a formula and is tricked into having it stolen . It 's very well filmed and you 'll be rewinding if not watching all over again to see them is directions the thrives use .	1
The Spanish Prisoner has about as many twists as a coil of rope , and figuring out how all the pieces fall into place is what makes this movie so damn good ! So if you like your suspense on the intellectual side and can deal with a movie that 's more than just Breasts , Booms , and Blood check this movie out . The only problem was that for this movie to work the schmuck in the lead ( Campell Scott ) has to walk into every preconceived little snare set for him . But once you get past that one minor detail the movie is pure cerebral entertainment . Steve Martin 's performance is a knockout ! One of the finest scripted films I have ever seen , they just keep on messin ' with Campell Scott !	1
Loved this movie . It had great mystery and tongue and cheek humor at the same time . I really do n't want to give anything away because I knew nothing about this film when I saw it , which was great because there were so many twists that kept me completely interested throughout . The main character , Joe , ca n't trust anyone and you 'll see why . Enjoy .	1

Hartley 's Masterpiece : An epic , dark comedy with heart and soul and bruises.If Hal Hartley were never to make another film , he could easily go down as having created a genuine American Masterpiece with & quot ; Henry Fool. & quot ; Hartley takes this material and stamps it with heart and soul and distance . It 's like staring at a palette of beautiful colors - then stepping back to realize it 's a bruise . Henry is never less than this astonishing.As Henry , Thomas Jay Ryan gives what is easily the best film debut I 've seen in many years . None of the wimpy whispery-voiced drivel that passes for acting these days ( from even some of our best screen actors ) his performance practically pops off of the screen like a fart at a funeral . The rest of the cast - James Urbaniak , Parker Posey , Maria Porter , Kevin Corrigan , et al . - are on the same inspired level , but it 's obvious why the film is named after Henry . I can not wait to see this man in more.Obviously allegorical , & quot ; Henry Fool & quot ; fairly teems with its laundry list of symbolism both quaint and profound , easy and impossible . I found my cheeks hurting from the smile stretching across my face for much of the film . Other moments had my eyes welling with tears at the beauty - and pain - these oh , so deceptively simple lives toil through.This is not , obviously , a film for all audiences , there is something of the fairy tale here and while suspension of disbelief is required , it is also its own reward . Actually the characters , though larger than life , are so evenly and wondrously drawn as to become recognizable to all of us as ourselves or others in our own lives . Here we weigh out the seemingly unfair advantages we perceive & quot ; others & quot ; has having , the pronouncements of self-worth and desire for acceptance and understanding.Hartley 's dialogue is equal to the visual aspects of his film : almost stagey ( in the good sense ) , but with a direct honesty that many , unfortunately , will find offputting . His cast delivers these perfectly placed pronouncements with all the gravitas demanded of the situation - and sound natural doing so . It 's a beautiful film to listen to.Aside from the brilliant storytelling , & quot ; Henry & quot ; is also beautiful to look at . Hartley 's cameramen lens a Queenscape most unusual - one never quite feels he knows where it 's taking place , despite obvious & quot ; Queens & quot ; clues . Every frame - from Henry 's powerfully bizarre arrival to the last triumphant ( and gloriously ambiguous ) cell is a pleasure , a joy to watch.At its conclusion all I could say was & quot ; this was the best movie I 've ever seen. & quot ; Upon reflection , I realize it probably is n't , but at that moment ( and each ensuing viewing ) I recapture that same , precise feeling . That 's what I want in a movie and Henry delivers every time .	1
If Hartley were reading this page of reviews , he would be laughing himself silly . So many of the reviewers here could be Henry Fool that it 's pathetic.The first thing one has to realize about this movie ( and which should be obvious to anyone who was watching even halfway closely ) is that Henry Fool is full of it . The sheer irony of the film is that he is nothing of what he makes himself out to be ( a tortured genius , a misunderstood writer , a callous scoundrel , etc . ) and simultaneously everything that he rails against ( primarily the pseudo-intellectual elite ) . Henry is the epitome of the pretentious slacker plaguing modern America - always complaining , always about to do something momentous , always focusing on his/her needs , always feeding off of others , and never providing an unselfish moment for others . Henry makes time for Simon only because it amuses him to do so - he feels superior to Simon , even in the face of Simon 's awakening greatness , but once Simon becomes independent of him ( witness the negotiation scene between Simon and the publishing mogul ) , then Henry dismisses Simon as part of the world that does n't understand his `` unique '' and lamentably absent genius.But , to his defense , Henry does exhibit flashes of true humanity . He does love Fay , although he is incapable of showing it for more than a few minutes at a time . He is genuinely concerned about the abused Pearl and her mother , although it unwittingly gets him into a larger mess than anticipated . In his attempts to show his artistic sensibilities at the start of the film , Henry unwittingly sparks Simon 's genius by encouraging him to write down any thoughts that strike him , although its clear that Henry expects nothing of import . Henry is the catalyst for Simon , Fay , and others ' lives , and the fact that he does so little while talking so much is part of the ironic fun in this film - those who speak the least ( Simon , Henry 's son , and Daughter Dang ) are the ones who do the most.At the bottom of it all , Henry 's biggest failing to refusing to accept his mistakes and crimes . He claims unrepentance but feels a deep-seated shame that comes out in his excuses - `` People like us , Simon , great writers , ca n't be tied down to the everyday mundane existence of the common rabble '' is a speech that resurfaces time and time again as a reason to avoid everyday labor , and the fact that he claims that his affair with the 13-year-old is part of some conspiracy against him is symptomatic of his refusal to come to terms with himself.The nature of discontent and how it brings out our seamier qualities is exemplified in Henry and other characters . The characters who accept their lives as given are the ones who succeed , while those who are discontented are driven to crime , drug and alcohol abuse , denigration of their families , and suicide `` Does it matter that it 's not remarkable ? '' asks Simon of his clinically depressed mother . `` Yes , '' she replies , shortly before her death.In short , Henry is a fool - he knows what is right , but he does wrong for the gluttonous joy of it . He knows what he should do to succeed in the world but chooses to live off of others because it would be too much effort otherwise . He has every reason to be content ( a house , a lovely wife , a loving son , and a steady if menial job ) but prefers his cynical and self-destructive worldview . He is everything that the world tells us can bring no good - and yet , he does manage to procreate two great things of beauty while living with the Grims - an amazing poet and a kindly , intelligent son . In the end , Henry is provided with a choice - to either run from his troubles as he has always done or to face the music and be a mensch . Which does he choose ? is the question that Hartley leaves us with , along with the rest of this quirky , bumpy film.While a good show , `` Henry Fool '' is not as engaging as `` Trust '' nor as offbeat as `` Amateur . '' However , it is still a film worth watching . Forget the over-wraught analytical nonsense that the some many of the other reviewers and I have spewed - instead , watch this film and see if you can recognize a Henry Fool in your life .	1
I first saw part of HENRY FOOL on either the Sundance Channel or the Independent Film Channel . I 'm not sure what it was , but the filmed sucked me in . There are some scenes that are fairly shocking ( Faye and Henry consummating their relationship as Simon finds his and Faye 's mother lying dead in the bathtub ) . However , the scenes are filmed in such a way that they do n't seem as horrifying as they would be in real life . The film addresses some big issues , e.g . what is the nature of an artist ? It also has a delightful cast , contains some extremely intelligent and witty dialogue , and has a great score . The best thing I can say about the film is that I had n't seen the whole movie when I purchased the video and after watching all of HENRY FOOL , decided I liked the movie enough to keep it .	1
This is a rare jewel of a movie , I wish I had watched this earlier . The ending I must say is very interesting . But if you are a romantic at heart then this is the movie for you !	1
This is actually Joseph Conrad 's AMY FOSTER , retitled for the film . Well acted , well filmed , good sets . However , it lacks a little something compared to the written version , and I think a a bit more character development would have improved the film . Do n't view this if you are upset by sad endings , or a character coming to a sad end .	1
This is a keeper ! What a movie ! Where was I when this movie came out ? This is a great romance although it has a very sad ending.This is a must see if you love romance and passion . I do n't want to say too much because it 's a complicated movie to discribe . It 's intriguing.Both the main actors are outstanding and you will feel their love and their pain.You need to order this one right now ladies , just get it ! You will not be disappointed !	1
No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars , or sailed to an uncharted land , or opened a new doorway for the human spirit . ~Helen KellerAmy 's life is lonely and she lives in almost complete silence , obeying the wishes of the family she works for in a coastal village . She is captivated by the sea and collects treasures that float up on the beach near her secret hideout/cave . For the first part of the movie , she seems to be living in a dream world . While some think she is a simpleton , others think she is a witch who can conjure storms . She has a gentle , patient , malleable nature.Often Amy ( Rachel Weisz ) is found dancing in the rain or standing in a window letting the wind and rain drench her clothes . She is a child of the water and loves the rain , rivers and the ocean . She seems to drift from reality into fantasy as she twirls in the rain . In fact , it seems she dreams her true love into life . She seems to be calling to him from the cliffs of Cornwall.Yanko ( Vincent Perez ) arrives in Amy 's village and changes her life . He is the only survivor of a shipwreck . He finds himself in a foreign land with no way to communicate with the residents . They fear strangers and almost kill him a few times before they allow him to live a normal life.Amy seems to be a naturally kind and compassionate Pices . She also seems to be in love with Yanko from the moment they gaze at one another through the kitchen window . Like two trapped animals set free , they run to each other whenever possible and share a secret world only they understand . `` I 'm your home and you 're mine . '' ~YankoWhile both Yanko and Amy seems to live at a higher level of existence , you might be shocked by the downright cruelty of many of the villagers . There is a sharp contrast between those who are accepting of Yanko and those who are willing to shun even those who talk to Yanko . Amy not only faces distain because of her quiet manner , she is also hated because she welcomes Yanko into her life . She accepts him like a gift from the sea.James Kennedy ( Ian McKellen ) realizes he is one of the Russian emigrants from a recent shipwreck while the rest of the village views him more cautiously . James does n't seem to know the full story and the wounds are only healed by retelling the story to Yanko 's former employer.At times this movie borders on cinematic extravagance . The widescreen edition is stunning in places . Scenes of Amy dancing in the rain in a blue haze , horses pulling carriages across vast expanses of land , trains , seascapes , ships and an abundance of lush scenery at the edge of the ocean.Being a lover of the ocean myself , I rather liked this movie . Not only is the scenery gorgeous , the score is dramatic , romantic , filled with longing and almost torturous in places.Swept from the Sea is a story of two people who have a connection to the ocean and who understand one another on the deepest levels of the soul . Most of what goes on in this movie seems to go on in your own mind . Yanko and Amy seem to almost speak to one another telepathically . At times it is pure magic ! ~The Rebecca Review	1
Well . Tom Jones IS my favorite video ( of the TV series fame ... Henry Fielding would just be so happy to have seen it ! ! ! ! .. ) but this with my God of music John Barry , and God of literature `` Joseph Conrad '' as a focus to those you were brave and who dared ... . I have worked on the sea , on ships , and lived as an outcast ... For a romance , drama , mystery , historical , play ... this movie blows , `` Lord of the Rings '' , `` Marnie '' , `` Gone with the wind '' , all Thomas Hardy movies , `` A year of living dangerously '' , `` far from the madding crowd '' ... . and more away . HEART . CORAZON . COEUR . Do you have the ability to see the person behind the prejudice ? ? Can you dance ? Must you close the door of your expensive metal machine with 4 synthetic rubber tires and a multiple horrible electronic systems from being able to walk for 6 miles in freezing rain to save the one you love who does not understand yet you love them ? ? ?	1
This is the most amazing concert I have ever seen ! The all-star cast , featuring singers from around the world , put on an excellent performance . One man tops them all : COLM WILKINSON . The greatest voice the world has ever known.If there is such a thing as perfect - This is it !	1
I know I freaked out , but this is really a great musical . I 'm sure that if u purchase this DVD/ VCD/ VHS/ CD/ whatever , u 'll be very proud to be able to buy it.The who cast has been carefully chosen , thro my observation , for each of them have their unique points . You see it , and do n't buy it ? You 'll regret that . Mh family 's fav muscial is this : Les Miserables . Second goes to Phantom .	1
Ah , Les Mis , a fantasic stage musical.I do not even need to mention how positively devine the music is . We all know that . I 'm here to comment on the over all quality of the concert itself.First of all , I really disliked Colm Wilkinson 's Jean Valjean . He barely put any expression or acting into it , plus he looked the same throughout the whole video . He just did nothing for me . Philip Quast , on the other hand , was BRILLANT ! An Oscar worthy preformance , if you ask me . Not only is he the absolute Javert , he is an incredible actor . I do n't remember the rest of the cast by name , so I 'll just address the charcters . The Thenardiers were very good ... hilarious , at that ! The actor who played Enjolras stole the show ... he was beyond exceptional ! Everyone else was quite good at their roles , too . Colm was the only disappointment.This video is lacking a few things however . First , they cut a few songs and scenes from the actual musical . Secondly , it 's NOT a taped version of the actual show , so the wonderful sets and character interactions are not here . That 's about all that 's missing . Watch it for Philip Quast and be blown away . Highly recommended to the Javert fans .	1
althought its not the entire show : - ( ( its 3 hours long ) , this recording has to be the best of all the numerous versions of the album . and the end where all the valjeans from all the different language productions sang do you hear the people sing was just absolutely excellent . Colm Wilkenson and Philip Quast were absolutly stunning as valjean and javier , and lea songa of miss saigon fame was so passionate , and micheal ball as mareus superb ! if you havent seen this already buy it buy it now !	1
If the love of musicals is an acquired taste , then Les Miserables is as the French say , my ` piece de resistance ' . I have seen this for the nth times and I have yet to see a flaw - it is perfect . Lea 's performance was so moving that in her ( Eponine 's ) dying scene , you could see the boy Gavroche visibly close to tears . Colm Wilkinson was good , but I would have preferred Gary Morris ; his Bring Him Home in the symphonic recording is simply the best . The young Cossette hardly missed a beat singing Castles in the Clouds even when startled by the slammed door . Everybody has perfect voices that even the actor who sang only three lines ( `` You , in the barricades , listen to this ... '' ) was marvelous . This ` dream cast ' will set the standards for musicals for lifetimes to come .	1
Words fail me when I try to describe this video . Les Miz is a glorious play , what with the genius of Boublil & amp ; Schonberg . I did n't think I would much enjoy this video because of its lack of actual set & amp ; acting and also the few short pieces cut . But it still blew me away . Best of all was the cast . It truly was the definitive edition.Colm Wilkinson is just the perfect Valjean . His voice has such emotion & amp ; resonance to it . And he has such a strong presence as an actor.Philip Quast was another excellent performer . I 've once heard his voice described as & quot ; flinty & quot ; and I think that that 's a good word for it . He really portrays Javert with such coldness , he makes the character quite vivid.Ruthie Henshall 's Fantine is one of those rare performances in musical theatre which simply can not be surpassed . Henshall 's voice is so stirring , heartbreaking , reverberating , deep , chilling , and beautiful . Her & quot ; I Dreamed a Dream & quot ; is excellent ! Michael Ball 's Marius needs to introduction . He 's THE Marius , what else is there to say ? His voice so , so powerful and he sings with such heart . His & quot ; Empty Chairs At Empty Tables & quot ; is truly captivating.Michael Maguire 's Enjolras is often criticised . Yes , this was n't the best performance he probably could have given and he did miss a few notes . But he still has a great voice . People argue that Anthony Warlow is a better Enjolras . While I agree that Warlow has the vocal edge , there 's something in Maguire 's performance that makes him so much like Enjolras and just so perfect for the part.Judy Kuhn 's Cosette was the one performance which I can say is good but not great . She did n't strike me the first time I heard her , though she has grown on me . She does have a lovely voice , but I just do n't go for the whole & quot ; ringing soprano & quot ; thing . In fact , almost all Cosettes & amp ; Christines and the like in general just annoy me . I think Kuhn sounded better as Pocahontas.Hannah Chick 's little Cosette was SO adorable ! She did n't miss a note during & quot ; Castle On A Cloud & quot ; which she just sang so sweetly . At the same time , she did n't seem to overact the sweetness , which I 've seen all too many Cosettes do . And the way she kept singing after the stage light explosion was very professional.And Adam Searles , got ta Love him . Similar to Maguire , I have heard Gavroches with better voices that Searles but he just has the part of Gavroche down so well . He just has the perfect street-wise , smart-aleck attitude perfectly.I was shocked as to how many people disliked Lea Salonga 's Eponine . Even more shocking was how people insisted that Frances Ruffelle was much better . I think Salonga was THE most phenomenal singer of the night . To me , Ruffelle sounds terrible ! Many have called Salonga too & quot ; bitter & quot ; or & quot ; angry & quot ; but Eponine is a bitter , angry character ! Salonga sings with such force , and at other times ( e.g . & quot ; A Little Fall of Rain & quot ; ) with such sad sweetness . Her & quot ; On My Own & quot ; was so excellent that watching it is an intense experience . I could barely tear my eyes from the screen the first time I saw her sing it . I think there is no question that she 's THE definitive Eponine . 'Course that 's just my opinion.All in all , this was the greatest performance of Les Miz I have ever seen !	1
I have never had the oppurtunity to go to this show in person but I have the CD and the video and next time it comes ot my town I will be there no matter what . I have nearly all the words memorized . I got this tape for Christmas from my parents and I used to watch at least once a week until my sister borrowed and has not yet returned it . Colm Wilkinson is amazing ! I think that all of th singers did a good job of singing and acting their parts . I think that every one should see this and read unabridged version of the book . The musical is the best representation of the book that I have yet seen . Buy it now !	1
One of my favorites . Kathleen Turner does a great job . Love Nicholas Cage ! Classic movie , lots of fun . Star-studded cast .	1
I have always loved this movie , It has a timeless story and great understanding of what if ?	1
`` Peggy Sue Got Married '' is about a woman , who recently learns of her successful husband 's philandering ways . She goes to her high school reunion wearing a 60 's outfit and when she sees her estranged husband at the reunion and she 's voted `` Prom Queen '' at her reunion , then she faints only to awake back in the 1960 's ! Everything is back as it was . This time she has a chance to change her future . Only to realize that maybe trying to change her future is n't such a good thing , after all.It 's a poignant and witty film that allows you to fantasize about `` What if ... '' I would have done such and such , then what would have happened ? To find out exactly just what happens in this exciting and entertaining film with a wonderful soundtrack , then I highly suggest you rent or buy this 80 's classic today ! You 'll be glad you did because the quotes are witty , too ! Highly recommended for anyone and everyone ; although , it does slightly touch on death , so it might be recommended for those children under 13 .	1
Normally I tend to avoid comedies , preferring psychological dramas or action films . So when my partner dragged me to this , I was surprised and delighted as its depth and ironies and multi-layered story.It starts off in a mid-life crisis : mom is separated and struggling , has a caring child , and wonders if her whole life has been a mistake at her 25th reunion . Suddenly , she finds herself back in time , right at the moment that she made her most important choices.When she realizes that she may actually be back in time , she injects a kind of nostalgic sarcasm into everything unlike any comedy I have ever seen . It is funny , moving , and deep , quite an amazing combination . You never know if it was just a dream , but suspect it was not.The acting is absolutely wonderful , too . This may be K Turner 's best role : she is at turns beautiful , awkward , sexy , mean , caring , ironic , and loving . And it is all believable . This was also the first film I saw Nicolas Cage in , and he is an amazingly good adolescent of the late 50s . Sophia Coppola is also wonderful.I was scared I might be disappointed seeing this nearly 20 years after I first saw it , but it moved me just as deeply . This is one of the best comedies I have ever seen , worthy of a talent like Coppola 's .	1
Viewed : 7/03 , 12/04 , 2/07 , 10/10Rate : 102/07 : Sex , Lies , and Videotape is a small masterpiece . Starting off slow while slowly building up the depth of the characters , it begins to revolve around one man , Graham Dalton played superbly by James Spader , and then the conflict explodes in a climatic ending . Steve Soderberg keeps his direction taut and focused on the four primary players while trying to let the characters evolve and become the people with real problems . It 's interesting how the conflicts of each player are intertwined with others , and then they become connected . The performances are outstanding : James Spader , Andie MacDowell , Peter Gallagher , and Laura San Giacomo . It 's funny that I would see James Spader 's character to be dark and mysterious , but in the end , he is just an ordinary person ; however , not as mysterious as Mickey Rourke 's John of 9 Weeks . What makes Sex , Lies , and Videotape to work and achieve its accolades is the simplicity of the picture.10/10 : The sensual energy is what sustains the momentum for Sex , Lies , and Videotape that never lets down . The performances by James Spader , Andie MacDowell , Peter Gallagher , and Laura San Giacomo are throughly excellent and flawless . What I loved about the film the most is how James Spader 's performance affected everybody else around him and how his character is the focal point even though he has a small but important role . This was a very small , low-key type of a picture , but the way Steven Soderbergh executed it ... that was just brilliant . It was also his first full-length picture . So kudos for him . Of course , the title is misleading , making the audience think it might entail some nude scenes , but the film actually never did a second of it . That is what was so brilliant about the film : the sexual feelings and the romanticism aspect of it yet no actual viewing of naked people . Other films will do the obvious and still fail to be a sexy picture . All in all , Sex , Lies , and Videotape is easily the best film of everybody 's career and remains one of the best films I 've ever seen .	1
A strange , but very rewarding movie . It opens with Ann ( Andie MacDowell ) talking to her therapist ; sex does n't mean much to her , she 's repressed about it , etc . It just so happens that her husband John ( Peter Gallagher ) is having an affair with her sister Cynthia ( Laura Giacomo ) . Along comes an old friend of John 's , Graham ( James Spader ) . He tells Ann that he 's impotent , that he gets off by watching videos he 's made of women talking about sex . Ann is repulsed and attracted to him at the same time , while hot-to-trot Cynthia goes right after him and makes a tape with him . Ann is shocked , then discovers the affair her husband is having , and decides to go to Graham , too - and makes her own video . Actually she makes a video of him : she gets him to confess that he does what he does because he is a liar about his impotence . She gets him to make love to her , she leaves sleezeball John , and the movie ends with Ann and Graham together . At first I did n't like the major scene with Ann and Graham , but after a second viewing I found it to be much more coherent and interesting . Graham has a neat little secret that has caused him to arrange his life so he 'd never have to feel again . Ann changes all that , and it was great seeing them together at the end of the movie . An intelligent , well-acted picture ; definitely worth a watch .	1
A prestigious , successful and selfish lawyer , whose wife has become frigid , has decided to have an affair with his sister in law .But an old colleague is invited for him to his home in such effervescent state of things . You will discover why you do not have to experience with the feelings and desires of the human being because you as hunter may be well become hunted and being the fatal victim of your own and immature behavior.A lesson life , excellently acted with reminiscences of the Nouvelle Vague with Chabrol , Rohmer and Malle as their major influences .This film was the Opus one of Soderbergh , winner in Cannes and to date undoubtedly his masterpiece .	1
James Spader is excellently low-key in this easy unraveling of four people 's lives : 2 young men exactly alike grow up to be completely different adult men thru the sheer willpower of one ; 2 sisters very much unalike grow up to become more alike thru the efforts of both . Spader 's sad need to masterbate with videotapes is equally pathetic to McDowell 's inability to orgasm , both of which result from their selflessness . 'sex ... ' has it that sex choices result in life choices . As with all of 'S'pader 's movies : S is for sex . Goodie.Movie Taster JB Boston , Ky .	1
This is a classic that can be watched over and over . One of those movies you always remember seeing the first time and when seen again , you get that original feeling all over again . Starman ( Jeff Bridges ) was great integrating his alien persona with the DNA of Karen Allen 's dead husband . His nomination for best actor 1984 was well deserved . Charles Martin Smith was just as good playing the role of a Gov't employed member of SETI -- he quickly realized who the true enemy was -- an over the top Government CIA/FBI/Special Agent etc . who was more interested in cutting up Bridges ' character than welcoming him to our world -- -remember the gold disks message -- welcome to planet earth ! This one is a winner..	1
I loved this movie as a kid , and I love this movie as an adult . I am now 28 years old . This movie really makes you think about the savageness of the human species . The movie made me think long and hard about two things : 1 ) is it moral to slaughter animals , especially those that do not threaten us ? 2 ) is our modern society really as sophisticated as we think , or much more primitive than we 'd like to believe ? Good movies should make us think , and this one definitely does .	1
Which means you have to see it ! Jeff Bridges does a good jobof playing a man from another planet . He only has so little to workwith in order to get back home . Another *5* star movie !	1
This is a movie everyone can love , not just science fiction fans . Jeff Bridges , young and buffed , plays the starman who uses DNA in a lock of hair from the husband of a grieving young widow to clone a body for himself . Science fiction fans will love watching the clone grow in a very realistic special effects scene ; fans of buffed young men will love the result.He learns quickly , but oddly . The whole movie constitutes a playing out of the old adage of `` to see ourselves as others see us . '' And of course , much of it really is very funny . Because much of American life is very funny , when you think about it . Starman will make you think about it.There are not a lot of special effects , but there are several really wonderful concepts , like when the starman revives a doe that had been tied across the trunk of a hunter 's car.But a woman can not run around with a clone of her beloved husband for too long before sex comes to mind . And it does . Starman gleefully declares it is better than Dutch Apple Pie ! As Pennsylvania Dutch myself , that 's pretty darn high praise . `` I have left you with a baby , '' Starman says . `` No , that 's not possible ; I ca n't have a baby . I 'm sterile . '' But of course it is there.He has to go back , or he will die . He tells the young widow , who is now effectively losing her husband a second time , to tell the child about him . As the Starman explains , it is her husband 's baby , but it is also his.It 's a better movie than I am able to describe . Buy it and cherish it !	1
Some thought this was rather goofy , but its actually well acted.. all things considered . Good Movie.. Good story line . A+	1
By hook or by crook ! The region 4 DVD is in Widescreen and comes surprisingly fat with extras including `` A making of '' Featurette , theatrical trailers for Starman as well as Close Encounters and an audio commentary with Jon Carpenter and Jeff Bridges which is terrific ! Not only that , there 's also a music video of Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen singing `` All I have to do is dream '' which is the song that Jenny Hayden and her husband , Scott , sing in the home movie she 's watching at the beginning of the film . This is without a doubt Carpenter 's best film , whether it 's due to the writing or the actors or that he 's just got a talent for doing romance or as he refers to the film `` chick movies . '' Listening to Bridges and Carpenter discuss the film , film techniques , Jeff and Karen 's performances and acting in general was an absolute pleasure . Looking at this movie again , it 's no wonder why Bridges was nominated for an oscar.PS : He gives away the secret technique he used to how he played Starman .	1
I think Karen Allen is one of the most underappreciated actresses around . Just watch what she does with this role , it 'll make your heart melt . Jeff Bridges manages to hit just the right note as the alien trying to understand humanity , and falling in love along the way . The chemistry clicks in a gentle , wonderful way . The only false element , and I think it handicapped the movie and prevented it from being truly great , were the & quot ; bad guys & quot ; , the military persuing the Bridges character . As eager as I was to buy into the plot , the antagonists were cartoonish . A more menacing , subtle threat to the alien 's mission would have given the movie a second , darker dimension .	1
This is definately a movie for all you hopeless romantics out there ! It is sad and hopeful at the same time . I loved Jeff Bridges in this . He and Karen Allen make a wonderful team and there is real electricity . I still cry every time I watch this .	1
This is a very touching movie and I did cry at the end . Karen Allen is great and Jeff Bridges is flawless in his portrayal of an alien . If you like love-stories , then you 'll love this movie .	1
This is a Great Movie and story , Jeff Bridges and all the actors are top notch in this Classic Sci-Fi movie . The story and outcome of the film will touch your heart . I Love the scene with the Deer , The movie shows how people really are in this world we live in . I sided with the Alien all the way of course so will you , the movie teaches all of us a lesson on life , when a movie brings tears to your eyes and touches your heart you know it is good . And this one is , I wish there were more movies like this today . A rare Gem .Highly Recommended .	1
Sweet old fashioned fantasy . Both characters are believable and so innocent . I appreciate the beauty and simplicity of this film . Jeff Bridges was just becoming a polished actor at this point and you could tell where he was headed . A sweet love story for all .	1
& quot ; Starman & quot ; has long been one of my favorite films , I fell in love with it when I saw the orginal theatrical release , still loved it years later when it made the rounds on & quot ; Movie of the Week & quot ; , and now after all these years I still love it on DVD . You can find tons of films about love and about life from the stars but it 's rare indeed to find both in the same film . I can only add my praise to that of the other fans of this beautiful film ; great performances , great story , great soundtrack . I only wish there could 've been more & quot ; extras & quot ; for the DVD release , otherwise & quot ; Starman & quot ; is the type of film that made Hollywood the & quot ; dream & quot ; capital of the world .	1
STARMAN [ Amazon ] [ Jeff Bridges , Karen Allen , Charles Martin Smith / Directed by John Carpenter / 1984 / 115 minutes / Rated PG-13 ] This 1984 movie about a space alien who takes on the physical appearance of a young woman 's dead husband has n't aged as well as some sci-fi movie of the period because the special effects now seem especially cheesy . That aspect , however , was never among the reasons to see `` Starman '' . What makes it worthwhile are it quirky , touching love story , its gentle humor , and Jeff Bridges extraordinary performance as the alien , for which he received an Oscar nomination . Here , he proved himself to be among the great physical actors of his generation . Even if the story itself were not so strong , it would be worth watching the movie simply to see Bridges.Starman comes to visit our planet after we launch a satellite that broadcasts an ` invitation ' to any intelligent life that might be out there . As you might expect , though , when he gets here , the first thing our military does is to shoot him down . After bailing out , he makes his way to the isolated home of Jenny Hayden [ Karen Allen ] , the widow . While she is sleeping , he looks around the house and finds some home movies and a photo album . This is how he finds and assumes the shape off her husband [ we never see Starman 's real shape ] . His actions awaken her , and she has a shocked first encounter with this apparition . As military helicopters approach , Starman has no choice but to commandeer Jenny and her car for a mad dash across the country to Arizona , where he has one chance to rendezvous with a rescue ship from home . Along the way , they have many exciting adventures . They also discover that compassion and love may be truly universal.This is a lovely , touching film and certainly an atypical one for director John Carpenter .	1
This was perhaps Jeff Bridges ' best performance in a movie . He plays an alien who crashes on earth , takes on the appearance of a lady 's dead husband , and makes her drive him cross country to meet up with his spaceship . Along the way he learns about what it is like to be human . This is one of my favorite movies of all time . If you can find it ( Blockbuster or Netflix would be a good bet ) definitely watch it . You will love it .	1
My dad used to watch this movie a lot and we 'd watch it w/him . It took me a long time to understand it . It was the first time I 'd ever seen Jeff Bridges acting . So , when my dad told me that he was the voice of Prince Lir in & quot ; The Last Unicorn & quot ; , I did n't believe it because he did n't talk funny like he did in Starman . At any rate , what a great movie . The actors were wonderful , I have always liked Karen Allen . And Charles Martin Smith was great as well ( remember him as Toad in American Graffiti ? ) . This movie is not as sappy as E.T . and far from Independence Day . The music and effects are a little cheesy , but this was made in 1982 and I thought they did ok.The picture quality is great , I remember it being grainy on VHS . There was n't much for special features , unfortunately , but hopefully that 's not why you 'd buy the DVD . Over all , I 'd say it 's well worth the money .	1
still super movie ... Bridges is outstanding ! ! ! ! : )	1
I 'm a fan of John Carpenter ( producer ) , The Dude ( if you do n't know who that is , check out & # 34 ; The Big Lebowski & # 34 ; ) and Karen Allen ( Animal House ) so of course I had to see this movie again . John Carpenter ( & # 34 ; Halloween & # 34 ; ) did a movie called & # 34 ; Dark Star & # 34 ; while he was still in college that still has a cult following . & # 34 ; Starman & # 34 ; is more a product of the American culture of its time , but the question it asks ( & # 34 ; what would happen if some alien culture were to capture Voyager and take us up on our invitation to visit ? & # 34 ; ) and the answer this movie provides is intriguing - and far more believable that what we see today on such programs as H2 's & # 34 ; Ancient Aliens. & # 34 ;	1
This is a great movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection . Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too !	1
Beginning with the hollowy echo of the Rolling Stones ' hit & quot ; I Ca n't Get No Satisfaction & quot ; and accompanied by numerous visuals of a bleak and soundless outer space , & quot ; Starman & quot ; kicks off its unusually heartwarming story with a hovering satellite circumnavigating the muted cosmos , bleeping out salutations in a multitude of languages in the hopes that an alien passerby will hear and accept Earth 's amiable invitation . Unbeknownst to a recently widowed recluse named Jenny Hayden , she is the anchorage and guide for an extraterrestrial who abandons ship after a calamitous crash landing to Earth.Arriving at her home in the middle of the night , the foreign ball of light takes on the form of Jenny 's deceased husband Scott , sending her into an emotional tempest filled with hundreds of clinging memories . Starman 's time on Earth is limited , a simple visitation gone awry by appending circumstances . He must reach a specific place in the US within the time allotted to return home to his native planet or he will die on Earth . Jenny is his elected navigator for his destination , a reluctant and terrified aide from the start . As time passes , she learns of Starman 's dire situation and responds with empathy and support , at long last permitting herself to love again as fervently as she once had.Jeff Bridges gives an amusing and exceptionally believable impression of being in a foreign body , his wobbly gait and bird-like sharp head movements impressively sustained whenever he is on camera . Furthermore of clumsy charm are his speech patterns , patchy and monotone , his enunciation of simple English highly exaggerated and humorous . Even though Bridges is portraying a seemingly emotionally detached extraterrestrial , he manages to put forth overwhelming compassion with the subtle glistening of his eyes , something that one would least expect from this peripatetic spirit of the sky . As he becomes more accustomed to human interaction , so does he adapt to the body he assumed and the indescribable passions that the human spirit possesses . His candor is mesmeric and endearing , expressing nothing but the deepest sincerity in his words and feelings . It is a wonder to behold that one man can convey all this in a simple character like Starman . Oscar should 've been his prize.Karen Allen is the right-hand , the perfect balance to the awe-inspiring storyline with her realism , sensitivity and dedication to this perfect stranger with an all-too-familiar face . Her vast , pale eyes emanate fear , confusion , sympathy and adoration simultaneously , and her understated approach to her role makes Jenny 's ongoing turmoil genuine and heartfelt.I also think more attention should 've been given to the unpretentious and enchanting screenplay , proclaiming the beauty of humanity in one simple but sincere citation from Starman himself : & quot ; Do you know what I find beautiful about your species ? You are at your best when things are worse. & quot ; This is such a pure examination of human nature that I have seen thus far , and I recommend it to those who are fans of Steven Spielberg 's colossal tearjerker & quot ; E.T. & quot ; . Like Spielberg , I fear John Carpenter will not attract any artistic recognition from his peers or Hollywood 's many critics for quite some time , no matter how favored these kinds of films are with the general public . I beg to differ with these stony commentators when I say that if a movie makes you feel what is n't normally evoked in a more realistic situation , it should rightfully be deemed pure art . After all , who makes the claim that Oscar is the singular and indubitable voice for true talent ? Reflect on this , my fellow film buffs ...	1
Movie-5 stars , extras 0 stars , tranfer for Blu-ray ( anamorphic widescreen I might add ) 4 starsReally what is Columbia thinking ? `` Starman '' is one of John Carpenter 's finest films with an Oscar nominated performance by Jeff Bridges , a moving score by Jack Nitsche and a clever , thoughtful script that takes the same themes as Spielberg 's `` E.T . '' and develops them better . We get no extras . Nada . Nothing . We also get to pay a fairly hefty amount for the Blu-ray ( it 's retailed at $ 29.00 ) . Warner does a better copy of releasing their Blu-rays . Heck , even Fox and Universal have been making an effort to do a decent job with their films and TV shows on Blu-ray of late . `` Starman '' on Blu-ray is at least in widescreen and has a nice presentation with nice detail.Sony did n't really have to do much . England got a DVD edition of this with a commentary by John Carpenter . All they had to do was port that version over for this edition and throw on the original promotional featurette made back in the day . It would n't have been hard . Do n't get me wrong , this is a terrific movie and it looks great but it 's a LOUSY effort on behalf of Sony . That 's surprising given that they won the format war . You 'd expect a better effort than this truly lazy package.What can you do ? I suppose write Sony or wait to see if the UK version has the commentary track and other extras ported over to the Blu-ray . Since it 'll be region free buy that . If you must buy this cheap edition of the film try and pay as little as possible as this nearly bare bones ( it has BD Live capacity and-whoopee ! -- trailers ) editon of an exceptional film SHOULD retail at about $ 15.99 for what we get .	1
I was a bit apprehensive going into this flick : I 'd loved Wesley and Woody 's work in White Men Ca n't Jump and Wildcats , could they pull off the trifecta ? Thank the stars , their chemistry is intact , these two are one of the all time great screen couples . If only Woody could have found a way into Blade or Blade II . I guess he 's just a busy guy . If you 're a fan of edge of your seat action , drama and laughs , this flick is on the money !	1
Myself and my wife loved this movie ! Woody Harrelson plays a down-on-his-luck gambler who falls foul of the local Mafia with his gambling debts . Wesley Snipes plays his brother , a New York Transit Authority cop , who guards the so-called Money Train , an armoured subway car which collects the takings from each station . When Woody 's character gets a good beating for failing to keep up repayments , he feels the only way out is to rob the Money Train , with or without Wesley 's help ! And we are treated to a host of spectacular action sequences on the rails ! Jennifer Lopez ( BABE ! ) also features as a cop with whom both Woody and Wesley 's characters try to have more that a friendship with as well ! Overall , this movie is action-packed and funny , with enough stunts to satisfy the most jaded connieuseurs of slam-bang flicks , and contains great cinemantography and SFX with the train scenes in the climax ! DVD enhancement inmproves it even more , with sound FX that 'll blow away your living room !	1
Thunderheart is a terrific movie , well worth the purchase price of a single DVD . This film 's a longtime favorite of mine -- one of those movies I watched when I was bored , and then was blown away by how deep , interesting , and resonant it was . I 've seen the movie easily four or five times since and always find something new to notice.I love a lot of different things about it -- I love Ray 's journey in this movie ( and Val Kilmer is just wonderful in this role ) , the way his discoveries lessen his self-loathing -- and simultaneously humanize him and lessen his superiority toward others ( particularly others of the Sioux tribe that he encounters ) . He begins as a cocky , unlikeable , jerk -- and then we see the scared little kid beneath the surface.The film 's story is a great murder mystery -- but that 's really just to give us a way into the action . It 's also a wonderfully understated way of showing that what Ray hated was n't what was in others , but what was within himself . The man in the beginning of this movie is about an inch deep -- he has rejected everything about himself , his family , his rich family history as the son of a halfblood Sioux . By the end of the movie , he 's irrevocably changed -- a much more likeable and accessible person who no longer does things by the book , but by the heart . Kilmer 's performance is just so subtle -- you see it all in his face . There 's a lot of humor , too , just when you least expect it.I also love the aura of the supernatural/spiritual that fills this movie , yet ( to me ) it 's never hokey , but fresh , cool and really respectful . The spiritual is a big part of native American culture , and it 's treated that way here , but without smarm or too much obviousness . I love Ray 's unexpected visions , those ghostly moments in which animals truly seem to see things that are hidden.I also love every single scene Ray has with both Graham Green 's character ( and Graham Green just rocks -- he 's amazing ) , as well as all his scenes with a brave local native American schoolteacher . I like that there 's a hint of romance in the plot , as well , but that it 's subtext , and remains in the background ( no big romantic subplot ) . The entire final quarter of the film is just really moving to me.So many shots in this movie say everything without a word spoken . Even the very last shot of the film speaks volumes about what a different man Ray is now.A great movie , that has a lot to say .	1
Ray Levoi ( Val Kilmer ) , a promising East Cost FBI agent is assigned to a case . He assumes this is in the latter to promotion . Yet he is informed it is in an Indian reservation and that he is Indian and it is more diplomatic . The reality as in most of these stories is that there is a more nefarious purpose in mind.Will Levoi discover the real purpose of his assignment ? Will Levoi ferret out Whodunnit ? Will Levoi finger out what was done ? How will he handle confronting remnants of his unknown past culture ? A Major catalyst and almost the narrator of the story is Graham Greene . Born in Six Nations Reserve , Ontario , Canada and Graduate of The Centre for Indigenous Theatre 's Native Theatre School . He gives a true native feeling to the film.Formula story written by John Fusco has a Tony Hillerman feel . It has the advantage of not being Reforested . When Robert Redford gets a hold of a movie it looses its original purpose or feel and become some sort of political statement . This movie is just about someone finding himself , even if he did not know he was lost . If any thing it has a Joseph Campbell coming of age story.Mystery ! Coyote Waits	1
Short review : It 's hard to put my finger on it , there is no single aspect that jumps out at you , but this was a very interesting movie . It is entertaining as well and the performances are good , but the strength is the unique plot that hooks you very early and unfolds in a deliberate and dramatic manner throughout the movie.This one of those movies I had never heard of until a few months ago when stumbled across it on TV . It starts out a little over the top , mainly Kilmer 's overly arrogant character , but that is a necessary part of the plot and it all works out very nicely . Sam Shepherd and Graham Greene are very good in their roles , and give some good balance to Kilmer 's character.This film is a sleeper that you will enjoy very much . It is a very good cop/murder mystery with a small but interesting mystical component . Thunderheart is a unique , interesting and entertaining film that will surprise you .	1
I first saw this movie on HBO and was left wondering why I had n't seen this in the theatre.Val Kilmer is outstanding the FBI agent who finds that everything is not as it seems , not only with the FBI but with his own identity and heritage.The movie walks a fine line between mysticism and reality and does it well . The script is engaging and Micheal Apted 's direction keeps up the pace . All the supporting roles are very well done but Graham Greene was terrific as the Reservation sherrif.Based on actual events , there 's a real sadness to the story as we see how more than once , in most cases , our government really did n't the indians best at heart.If you read many reviews of this film you will find most people came to see it by accident or some quirk of fate . This is one of those films you stumble on and are thankful you did . Great cinema - an for those that have n't seen it yet , an undiscovered classic .	1
From this side of the world ( NZ ) it 's often hard to understand what the modern day 1st nations people go through , but films like this ( as fiction often is truth hidden ) I found the film enlightening . Would reccomend it to anyone . Packaging great and delivery in 5 days , Thank you	1
Thunderheart ( 1992 ) Val Kilmer , Graham Greene , Sam ShepardRated R for violence and some language.Spiritual , mystical and inspiring.An undiscovered classic.This powerful movie is about the heart wrenching journey of an FBI agent , who happens to be part Native American Indian , given a brutal assignment on the Oglala Sioux reservation in the badlands of South Dakota . He inadvertantly rediscovers his true spiritual heritage as his soul slowly awakens to everything around him in a relentless series of baffling and inexplicable occurances that coax him toward his unforeseen purpose.For once , he finds himself listening to his own inner voice and the ghost dancing kindred spirits trying to reach his soul from beyond , calling to him from their graves with dangerous visions.He becomes powerless to thwart his inescapable destiny . All of this amid the shanty rust , distrust , derelict vehicles and abandoned souls that comprise the barren reservation he has hesitantly invaded.A couple of perceptive residents come to know that he is there for a ordained purpose and they somehow recognize what his presence actually represents to the Oglala nation.This film is loosely based on true incidents that occured in the 1970 's at numerous reservations.There is a strangely haunting and mesmerizing score by James Horner.Masterfully filmed on location , the cinematography is vividly breathtaking . There is some humor and warmth , but this is a mystery thriller with some violence and it may be too intense for impressionable children . Still , it 's family fare for most . Not one dull moment due to a surperb director . Repeated viewings never get stale.Numerous meaningful moments are portrayed in this very special one of a kind story . There are many symbolic overtones that reach out to touch the soul , along with the otherworldly musical underscore.The story itself contains the spirit of the heart.The entire cast is excellent.This film was released the same year as Dances With Wolves and sadly , this sublimely bittersweet motion picture was overlooked .	1
This is a great American Indian movie ! It 's almost a virtual visit of Wounded Knee and this is one of the reasons I purchased this movie . I always enjoy learning about the Plains Indians and this movie gave an excellent account of `` The Knee '' . I felt like I was in this movie trying to help solve this murder and trading with Grandpa . I sympathized with Maggie and her children and fell in love with the Washington Redskin/Ray Lavoi , alias , Val Kilmer ( I 'm a big fan of his ) . This movie gave you an up-close view of the Pine Ridge Indian Res and all the injustices that have become a way-of-life to these people . You will want to run to the `` Stronghold '' with Thunderheart and shout for joy at their triumph there . Do n't hesitate to add this movie to your collection because it will put you there right in the middle of all the action . You will want to get up and dance at the PowPow , make a trade with Grandpa and root for Jimmy .	1
Love , Love , Love this movie ! ! ! we first saw this in the theaters years ago , unable to purchase in stores , always on back order or only available in a foreign language.amazon.com to the rescue , I watch this movie every other month ! Excellent quality and service amazon.com provides .	1
I am a real sucker for a good dance flick and love story , and if only I could shake it like they do , another good film : )	1
Do n't know how this is shown as a purchase because I did n't buy it however , I did see ! I enjoy some movies where they learn the dance steps and watch as they progress and I do enjoy them . If you think it is easy just try it . I 'll see a step like in the movie Cadence with Charlie Sheen and get up and try the step ... Did it ! Just fun stuff and some of these moves are a challenge .	1
Oliver should be a classic in every family home collection . This will be entertaining to children for all time .

We ca n't forget about these great musicals !	1
A superb adaptation of the hit London and Broadway musical play . Carol Reed 's direction is top notch and all of the players are exceptional . It is fast-paced , full of great songs and production numbers and a worthy winner of its six Oscars , including Best Film and Best Direction . Three songs from the original show were dropped ( I Shall Scream , That 's Your Funeral , My Name ) , but are n't missed as they are not central to the plot . A film truly fit for the whole family .	1
The musical score had little artistic merit , Fagin 's diabolical quarters are far more fun than Dickens intended , some characterisation is far off , and much of the literary impact is poor . I blush to admit that I just do n't care ! The film is hugely entertaining , and musical numbers , particularly those with Shani Wallis or Jack Wild , quite delightful.Though literary purists would deride that the sordid quality that gives Oliver Twist its impact is gone , this actually makes the film suited for family viewing . Assuming the adult mind knows full well that Dickens work was far from a musical comedy , the horrors of the situation of Fagin and Company is sufficiently blunted to keep children from being unduly troubled . Only Bill Sikes shows his true colours blatantly , and he is such a villain that children can deal with his character with surprising realism . They 'll never guess Nancy 's true profession ...	1
I have n't bought this yet . I have been waiting for Oliver to get the blu-ray treatment for Ages . I go online today and see that it is being sold by a 3rd party seller , and only 1 is left ... and it 's used ! Also , the Editorial Review - it 's in Italian ( ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) What is going on , Amazon ? ? ? This is one of the best musical put on film - and one of the very few to win Best Picture . It - and we - deserve better.Start stocking your own blu-rays on this , please ! ! ! And new ones ... : )	1
`` Oliver ! '' is the musical version of Dickens ' tale about an orphan in Olde England . Oliver is born in a miserable workhouse and eventually taken in by an old thief and his merry band of boys who train him to be a pick-pocket . He meets some memorable characters along the way : Ron Moody plays the infamous Fagin , the leader of the thieves , with sinister delight . Jack Wild ( the Artful Dodger ) steals all his scenes with his talent and charm . Mark Lester , as Oliver , is a little wooden but looks the part and is appealing . Oliver Reed is convincingly repellant as nasty villain Bill Sikes , and Shani Wallis is good as his girlfriend , Nancy , the street girl with a heart of gold.Lionel Bart 's music for `` Oliver ! '' is absolutely enchanting . Each song is memorable and the big production numbers are a joy to behold . As the Artful Dodger welcomes Oliver to London with `` Consider Yourself , '' and the street vendors sing the beautiful , `` Who Will Buy ? `` , you are swept away into a magical world . `` You 've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two '' and `` Reviewing the Situation '' are Fagin 's comic numbers that make you like him in spite of himself . `` Oliver ! '' won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1968 . Heartily recommended for the whole family.Kona	1
I was very pleased with the product I had received and the promptness from the supplier . I would not only order from this person but I would also reccomend them .	1
This is a musical Classic . If you do not know this movie by heart ... .you are not a true believer . On a side note , however , this movie is a great classic that protray the life of orphans and kids on the streets during th 1800 's . It shows how people would take advantage of the children 's situation and teach them bad lessons ,	1
Movie was wonderful . Reminds me of the first time I saw it . Superb acting . Love Jack Wilde even before H.R . Puffenstuff .	1
Excellent casting . Excellent music . I wish it had been a lot longer , because it was so enjoyable to watch and listen to .	1
Lovers of this glorious film might want to know that Jack Wild ( `` lummy Jack - the Dodger - the Artful Dodger '' ) died of mouth cancer on 1st March 2006 . He was 53 . From what I 've found about him on the Internet , he seems to have been an adorable man - good-natured , reckless , finally unlucky . When he made this film he was 15 , six years older than Mark Lester ( Oliver ) , but so short that he had to wear stacked shoes . He stayed friends with Lester and Ron Moody ( Fagin ) till the end.Morrissey 's dismal song `` Little Man , What Now ? '' was apparently inspired by Wild 's broken career , which if true reveals Morrissey as a chilly little creep but is no worthy memorial to its subject . `` 'Ow green can you get ? '' demands the Dodger on first meeting the innocent Oliver . Evergreen , Jack ; evergreen .	1
This is a great film and true in spirit and basic plot to Dickens . The songs are melodically wonderful and the choreography is original , fresh and keeps your eyes constantly on the screen . The movie is very well cast and Ron Moody is wonderful as Fagin . He is `` nicer '' than in the book ( maybe it 's the pet owl they gave him ) but his basic motivations and actions remain the same albeit he has a happier more ambiguous ending in the film . Oliver Reed is probably a more physically attractive Bill Sikes than the one most people imagine from reading Dickens ' work but he is certainly menacing and scary . Nancy , also , is much lovelier ( as well as older ) than the novel describes but the part is excellently acted and sung by Shani Wallis . The child actors are all engaging and do not have the smugness ( well the Artful and Charlie are supposed to be `` cheeky '' ) too many times seen in young kids in movies.The plot is simplified from the book and a few characters like Rose and Oliver 's evil half brother Monks are left out for time 's sake but it does not hurt the story since it could be argued that the original has too many complicated subplots . Some `` exciting '' scenes are added for the action loving moviegoer and rather disturbingly innocent Oliver is present at the scenes of both Nancy and Bill 's demise . Mr. and Mrs. Bumble do not have the larger , very comic , parts they play in both the novel and the originial musical though Mr. Bumble 's `` the law then sir is a bachelor ... and may he learn from experience '' speech is included and is almost word for word from Dicken 's original writing as are many other critical speeches throughout the film . Oliver is a wonderful gem the whole family can enjoy . The DVD does have to be flipped over and there are not many extras but these are minor quibbles in such a great viewing experience .	1
His son need 's a organ , and ge want his to give his kidney to him , but he does n't give it up with out a fight .	1
This derivative action suspenser about a psychopath , which has been slammed by critics as well as most reviewers below , may not be the greatest of its kind , though it is redeemed by the performance of Michael Keaton , who is always absorbing in this the role of manipulative , intelligent villains - ( see him also in & quot ; Pacific Heights & quot ; , which is a very good complimentary film to this one . ) Otherwise , the film is a breathlessly fast-moving thriller , at a suitable length .	1
Lawrence of Arabia ( 1962 ) is one movie that you never get tired of rewatching . This film is based on the writings of T.E . Lawrence ( a close friend of Virginia Woolf . ) I have to confess I have not read any of his writings at the time of this review.This is the story of a British officer who led the Arab armies against the Turks in the Middle East during World War I from 1915 to 1918 . However the film itself is anything but basic . It is one of the classics still of our time.As the media gets better this film has been remastered and given the Blu-ray treatment . It may one day be a candidate for 4K . However you will be so impressed with this film that the presentation media whether Blu-ray discs or streaming that the technical adjustments will be negligible to your viewing pleasure.I will not go into too much detail of the story as it is possible someone really has not seen this film before.The basic story is about a British officer that sees past the varied politics of the time and is able to find unique ways to help the Arabs create their own homeland whether they want it or not . However interesting the story is what makes this film unique is the stable of star actors , including of course Peter O'Toole , and extraordinary cinematography . The underlying music will stay with you for years.Many people have unique values as to what they would like to see in a movie . For me this film was excellent . I would suggest that no matter what your preference you do not pass up the chance to see `` Lawrence of Arabia '' .Lawrence of Arabia : The Authorized Biography of T.E . Lawrence	1
I have read several biographies of Lawrence . This film , of course , is the best ever made ( in my opinion ) . But instead of my going on and on about it with rants and raves , I think that some points can be pointed out that will enhance your viewing and even help you to wear a different pair of glasses ( a more accurate pair ) as you watch this film . Lawrence loved castles . Before World War I , he would bicycle all around Europe examining castles . Making maps and writing details about them . Then an opportunity arose . Oxford offered him a chance to be a real archeologist ! To go to Arabia and dig up Sumerian pottery . He did so and loved it . Because of his experience , & quot ; Ned & quot ; ( what his friends called him ) was therefore sent to Egypt to be , of all things , a spy ! I 'm sorry to say , he was not like James Bond . This was hard & quot ; detail & quot ; work . Decoding . This is what he is doing in the beginning of the movie . And you can tell from his history , he did n't like it ! He wanted to be active like his brothers ( 2 out of 4 , I believe , died on the front ) . The movie is an entirely accurate portrayal of Lawrence . Even the blood . War is a little different than a John Wayne movie . The torturing that he received at the hands of the Turks would stay with him until the end of his days . There were no abberations in regards to his being & quot ; a violent man & quot ; . When people start killing , it has a & quot ; herd & quot ; effect . Everybody goes crazy . He does seem to have done the entire Arab Revolt alone . There is one slight & quot ; flaw & quot ; in the movie . Not really a flaw . But it is easily viewed as such . Lawrence liked Allenby and Fiesal . If you can view this movie again , try to look through their eyes . Fiesal knew that Lawrence could go English at anytime . Allenby knew that Lawrence could go Arabic anytime . He was a threat . But he met the challenge . He worked as an aide for Winston Churchill after the war . Then he joined the ranks as an ordinary soldier . He was offered the Victory Cross . He turned it down and gave it to the Arab Republic . He was offered a knighthood . He turned it down , and once again , dedicated it to the Arab Republic . He was not gay . He was celibate from the day he was born until the day that he died . Except for many incidents afterwards . After Arabia when he joined the armed services for the rest of his life . He always made friends through kindness . He would have friends in the service beat him until he had an orgasm . Oddly enough , this was almost an exact enactment of what happened in Arabia when he was tortured . They would whip him hard on the back under the directions of an & quot ; alledged uncle & quot ; who would send him letters . The soldiers loved Ned . Not in a & quot ; carnal fashion & quot ; . But because of his kindness and generosity . So they would follow the orders at Ned 's requests . To be punished . They , of course , were written by Lawrence himself . Lawrence was very short ! About five feet and he had a & quot ; high-pitched & quot ; giggle . O'Toole and director Lean do an uncanny job with his characterization . In one of the early scenes of the movie , I could swear that they had gotten rid of O'Toole and put Lawrence in as a stand-in . The resemblence is remarkable ! O'Toole even handles the high-pitched giggle well . Listen carefully throughout the movie . O'Toole will have a & quot ; high-pitched & quot ; giggle ( actually a middle & quot ; range statacco laugh & quot ; ) to measure Lawrence properly . For all purposes , the movie is flawless . No . He was not illegimate . That part is very complicated . But you can be sure that from the beginning of the film to the entire end , the portrayal of Lawrence as a man during this period is 100 % accurate . View it again . And if I helped increase the movie 's enjoyment for you , this review was well worth writing . Thank you .	1
IT WAS SUCH FUN TO WATCH THIS CLASSIC AGAIN . I WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT IN THE DVD FORMAT . I ENJOYED WATCHING IT WITH MY MOTHER WHO IS HARD TO ENTERTAIN . SHE DOES N'T WANT TO WATCH SOMETHING SHE 'S ALREADY SEEN BUT SHE ENJOYED THIS ONE .	1
This spectacular masterpiece by the widescreen maestro is incomparable . The images contained within this film are indeliable , when the phrase & quot ; every frame a Rembrandt & quot ; is used as the mantra for exceptional cinematography , this film is what they are talking about.Every aspect of this film is epic - far too many to recite here - and the DVD chronicles it 's lengthy , incredible production masterly . The presentation ( sound & amp ; video ) is benchmark , and considering that the film is close to 40 years old it looks as if it was shot yesterday . Large format cinema has sadly all but vanished from narrative film , but we can always look back this film in awe and wonder.From Maurice Jarre 's ethereal score and Robert Bolt 's enigamic , yet involving characterization of Lawrence to the fantastic acting by O'Toole , Sharif , and Quinn and startling production design by John Box , one almost has to shed tears in light of the fact that we can no longer see films of this length , style , presentation and quality.Yet it can live again on a HDTV through DVD , nostalgia is usually fairly dangerous when it comes to art , but you can make an exception for this film .	1
One of the all time great movies.Finally in the sound and picture quality i have been waiting to have and meld into.Sound track in the top ten.And Peter O'Toole is so great you think he 'll have a break down any minute.Almost too much to see.And repeated viewing it grows deeper.Wow .	1
& # 34 ; Lawrence of Arabia & # 34 ; is arguably the besrt movie ever made . An outstanding international cast , a gripping story , superb cinematography , and exeptional directing . This is David Lean 's masterpiece . I only wish it would make it back into the theatres more frequently . This films deserves a large screen format .	1
WARNING : This review contains spoilers ! In 1962 , directorDavid Lean ( Oliver TwistandThe Bridge on the River Kwai ) made cinematic history with his epic historical drama , Lawrence of Arabia . The film is perhaps one of the most daring and ambitious films ever made . Utilizing an amazing screenplay written by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson , Lean created a film that is an intimate character study , a harrowing war epic , a spectacular adventure and one of the greatest achievements in the annals of filmic history . Lawrence of Arabia has gone on to become a classic . It won seven Oscars and garnered international acclaim . Even its few detractors ( most of which complain about the film 's historical inaccuracies ) will admit that it 's stood the test of time and only earned more praise over the years.The film tells the tale of staff-captain and Lieutenant T.E . Lawrence , an English officer stationed in Cairo during WWI ( at this time the Turkish Empire was ally to Germany and therefore a threat to British interests ) . Lawrence was a unique individual in that unlike most of his British compatriots , he understood that England 's military was losing the fight against the Turks . He also understood that the various Arab tribes were warring against the Turks , but they were too scattered and disorganized to make any real progress.Bored with his mapmaking and newspaper writing duties , he set forth a plan to get himself reassigned . He made himself out to be a general annoyance , obnoxious and peculiar . He managed to with the help of a senior officer , obtain a new position with the Arab Bureau . He would observe and chronicle the Arabs from within their encampment at Wadi Safra and evaluate their usefulness to the British war effort . Upon meeting Prince Feisal and his ill-equipped soldiers , Lawrence came to the conclusion that they were not only adequate as fighters but also courageous and dedicated . Their weaknesses were mainly that they lacked modern artillery , and that the various tribes were divided and constantly feuding with one another . Yet if they could be united , as one Arab people , against the Turks then they would stand a chance.Lawrence upon fist glance might seem the most unlikely person to do this . Though he was well educated and possessed an unusual understanding of the region , he was awkward and outspoken , which made him seem arrogant . Lawrence 's confidence at first offended the Arabs , who saw him as another cocky British officer , but they eventually came to respect his bravery and tenacity.It becomes apparent that in order to defeat the Turkish army that the seaport at Akaba must be taken . But it can not be approached by the sea due to the great immobile guns facing the water . It is decided that a small group of fifty men from the Harith tribe could take Akaba by land , but first they would have to cross 600 miles of desert and survive the `` impassable '' Nefudh desert . This treacherous journey tries them all and along the way Lawrence earns the respect of the Bedouin , especially Ali ( who he first met on his way to meet Prince Feisal , when Ali killed Lawrence 's guide for drinking from a Harith well ) . After saving a man 's life , Lawrence is given the name El Orens and is presented with the robes of a noble Arab tribe.Lawrence and Ali then manage to convince the Howeitat tribe to join them in their attack on Akaba , though they only agreed to do so when offered gold . Auda abu Tayi , the leader of the Howeitat , proves to be a great ally despite the fact that many of the Harith disapprove of Auda 's mercenary tactics . Finally they reach Akaba and their surprise attack is successful . However Auda is disgusted when he finds only paper money and not gold . Lawrence promises that Auda will be paid with gold but first Lawrence must deliver word of their victory to the British.He decides to take two young servants , Farraj and Doud , with him . The trek proves difficult and along the way Doud falls into a pit of quicksand and dies . Lawrence blames himself for the boy 's death . When Lawrence and Farraj finally arrive in Cairo they are treated with prejudice and discourtesy . Lawrence has grown so accustomed to his Bedouin garments that he 's not aware of how alien he appears to the other officers.The new general , Allenby promotes Lawrence to major and orders him to go back but Lawrence refuses at first . He 's tasted power and held many lives in his hands , and on some level or another he knows that giving him more responsibility would be a dangerous thing to do . Yet he agrees to Allenby 's proposition when Allenby subtly builds up his ego with talk of making history . He is also lied to when he asks Allenby whether or not the British have `` ambitions in Arabia '' after the war . Allenby tells him that they do not . As Lawrence leaves the General 's headquarters he 's overwhelmed with congratulations , which only inflate his ego further.When Lawrence returns to the desert he brings British ammunition and armored vehicles . His name becomes infamous and he is viewed by many as a hero . This is a fact which numerous journalists wish to exploit and in so doing encourage support for the war effort . Meanwhile Lawrence wages a guerrilla war against the Turks . He and his army attack the railway systems , weakening the Turkish forces one train at a time . He relishes the praise and adoration that is showered upon him but he begins to delude himself . After almost being killed by a gunman he jokingly says , `` Did n't you know , they can only kill me with a golden bullet ? `` After months of fighting most of the Howeitat tribe have gone home and even Ali seems to be concerned with Lawrence 's state of mind . After one of the attacks goes wrong Farraj is severely wounded and Lawrence is forced to kill him so as to spare him the unimaginable tortures that the Turks would use to extract information from him . Haunted by guilt , Lawrence recklessly decides to move ahead in his plans . He tells the few remaining Arabs that he intends to attack Deraa.Meanwhile the British general , Allenby begins to wonder if Lawrence has `` gone native '' . He fears that Lawrence no longer serves Britain but instead fights to guarantee Arab independence . His fears are justified . Lawrence , full of pride and false bravado , continues with his plans to advance to Deraa . The Arabs refuse to join him in his folly . So Lawrence goes alone , accompanied only by Ali . There Turkish soldiers capture him , though they never discover his identity . He is interrogated , beaten and brutalized before they release him . Lawrence is forever changed by this incident . He becomes insecure and disenchanted . His mind is polluted with doubts and anxieties . He decides to give up and allow the Arab revolt to be carried on by others . Ali and many of the Harith tribe feel betrayed and abandoned when Lawrence leaves.Upon his return to British headquarters , Lawrence is treated like an outsider . He meets with General Allenby and learns of a proposed treaty between France and England , who after the war intend to share the Turkish Empire ... including Arabia . Lawrence is outraged . He requests to be reassigned to a lesser position but Allenby manipulates him and talks him into leading the upcoming attack at Damascus . Lawrence buries his insecurities with anger , hiding his vulnerability with defiance . He agrees to lead the attack on Damascus if Allenby will nullify the treaty and guarantee that Arabia will be left to the Arabs . Allenby reluctantly agrees.When next the Arab army assembles , Ali sees a great change in Lawrence . He sees a man who is over confident and vengeful , bloodthirsty and guilt ridden . Lawrence now surrounds himself with vicious mercenaries who act as his personal bodyguards . On the road to Damascus the Arabs encounter a small town devastated by the Turks and Lawrence , prompted by his bodyguards and repulsed by the Turks , orders a bloody attack . `` No prisoners ! '' he shouts with indignant rage . When the battle is over , Lawrence finds himself covered in blood and surrounded by dead Turkish soldiers . He 's horrified by the pleasure he derived from the killing . Even those men who once admired him now look on him with fear and trepidation.Lawrence and the Arabs arrive in Damascus and they immediately form a committee . At the town hall they have a meeting to discuss the creation of a democratic Arab government but the Arab tribes have for too long fought amongst themselves . His attempt at uniting them proves to be in vain.The film ends with its viewers asking themselves whether Lawrence 's actions were altruistic or motivated by a hunger for glory , whether he was devoted to the Arab revolt or to his own hopeless search for identity.Clearly he was in real life a tragic hero , a complex man with great dreams and aspirations . But he was a man weighted down by flaws , flaws that sabotaged his potential to make wonderful changes in the Middle East.The cast is amazing . Peter O'Toole is riveting in his portrayal of the enigmatic Lawrence and Omar Sharif , as Ali , gives a complex and multi-faceted performance . The rest of the cast is also wonderful particularly Anthony Quinn as Auda abu Tayi , Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal , Jack Hawkins as General Allenby , Anthony Quayle as Colonel Brighton , Claude Rains as Mr. Dryden , and Jose Ferrer as the sadistic Turkish Bey who orders Lawrence to be beaten . The cinematography is breathtaking in its scope and gives the illusion that the desert is unending . The music by Maurice Jarre is incredibly powerful . It evokes images of sand swept dunes and bloody battlefields . It 's no wonder the film is recognized as one of the best ever made.At the time of writing this review there are four available versions of Lawrence of Arabia on DVD . The first is a bare bones single disc release , the second is an impressive 2-disc Limited Edition , the third is the Superbit edition , while the fourth and most recent is the 2-disc Collector 's Edition . Of the four DVD releases I would recommend the last three.For those interested in the historical Lawrence , I also recommend : Revolt in the DesertSeven Pillars of Wisdom : A TriumphLawrence and Aaronsohn : T.

I recently added this restored blu ray edition to my aging VHS and DVD copies and was startled at the increased sharpness and the rich depth of color I experienced ! This 50 year old masterpiece of film making looks and sounds as good as or better than any of the modern movies in my library created for this format ! Whether the scenes are indoors or on the sprawling sands of Arabia the detail is spellbinding . I have re watched it three times over the past week and I ca n't get enough . A great experience just got even greater .	1
This is an epic movie , the cinimatography was excellent , as is the acting . You will not see an movies like this anymore , shot on site , maticulous detail in every scene . Notice the pristeen sand , no tracks from previous shoots .	1
This review is for the quality of the blu-ray transfer and not the film itself . The blu-ray version of Lawrence of Arabia is stunning . The color saturation and tones are perfect . The level of detail is so fine at times that it is almost as if you are seeing the characters and scenes in real life . This is exactly what a viewer wants with a movie full of scenic vistas and exotic locations , like this one . The sound is also superb , with distinct dialogue and a soundtrack that soars . Thank you , Sony , for doing justice to this remarkable film.If you are considering an upgrade from DVD , it is totally worth it . This is one of the best blu-ray transfers I have seen of an old classic .	1
& quot ; Lawrence Of Arabia & quot ; is easily one of the best movies ever made . It 's my favorite David Lean picture . The movie is based on a true story about T.E . Lawrence ( Peter O'Toole , Oscar-nominated ) , a British officer , who wanted to get a job as an observer with Prince Feisal ( Alec Guinness ) , the leader of the Arab army . Lawrence led the Arabs against the Turks during World War I from 1915-18 . The movie is so damn long , but I saw all parts of it and it was great . & quot ; Lawrence Of Arabia & quot ; is the winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director ( David Lean ) . I have this movie on the Limited Edition 2-Disc DVD and I am happy to own it .	1
I regret that I first saw this film on network television after it had been hideously butchered by censors . Seeing the complete and restored work for the first time , however , was almost like seeing a different film.Much has been written about the acting , cinematography , sound track , production and direction of this film , all deservedly praiseworthy . I believe that all of these , however , serve to accentuate the ambivalence , and perhaps the amorality , of T.E . Lawrence . This film was far ahead of its time in its portrayal of the loathing and self-doubt experienced by a classically educated , Western man in contact with elemental nature and with the primal savagery of war.The broadly hinted at homosexuality and sado-masochism that Lawrence was never able to come to terms with in his written works also recur throughout this film , not as grotesquery , but rather as one further layer of misery and conflict added to the cauldron of war in the desert.Understated in many ways , this film maintains an amazing humanity , filled with pathos and dignity . It is deserving of a considered viewing .	1
I saw this classic many years ago when it first came out in 70 mm on a gigantic screen in San Francisco and was blown away . Since then and periodically I have revisited this classic and have come to the conclusion that had David Lean never made another movie after this -- he would still be considered one of the genius of cinema . Keep in mind that this film influenced a young Steven Spielberg to enter the field of filmmaking ( in fact he and Martin Scorsese had contributed to its restoration ) . And Peter O'Toole 's debut performance is still one of the greatest ever captured on film ! ! But that does n't detract from the other fine actors in the cast such as the 74 yr old Claude Rains still vibrant , a brilliant Anthony Quinn , the cynical Arthur Kennedy as a disguised Lowell Thomas reporter and in his debut , Omar Sharif who becomes Lawrence 's best friend and ally . Aurally and visually arresting with much food for thought , '' Lawrence Of Arabia '' deserves to be in the top ten of great films that the AFI have designated along with `` Godfather '' and `` Citizen Kane '' .	1
Since there are countless reviews of the film ( which is amazing , gorgeous , and thrilling beyond compare ! ) this will be a review of the single disc DVD version of this fine film.This DVD had all the features I was looking for ... ... complete opening , intermission , and closing music ... all provided in digitally mastered 5.1 Dolby Digital and Anamorphic Widescreen . No other special features to speak of ... . but it does provide subtitles in a variety of languages which I think is always a nice addition ... as well as scene selection.This DVD was beautiful to watch and listen to . If you are a fan of the film and are looking for something to hold you over until the 4k version is released ( in my dreams ! ) ... .. then this will do quite nicely .	1
& # 34 ; Lawrence Of Arabia & # 34 ; is perfection . A better film does not exist . This film is my choice for the best movie ever made . How 's that for a recommendation ?	1
This film has everything ! Beautifully filmed locations . Great acting by all involved . A great novel , rich in detail . If you ever get to see it on the big screen by all means go ! This film was delayed on blu ray far to long . Director David Lean 's film 's leave you satisfied after viewing . Peter O'Toole is magnificent !	1
Lawrence of Arabia is easily one of the greatest films ever made and there are plenty of reviews and comments already out there , so here 's my review of the 50th Anniversary Blu-ray . It looks and sounds absolutely stunning . I could not have asked for it to look or sound any better . It took a long time to get here , but Sony has not let us down . Now , I 've seen the film dozens of times , mostly in theaters in L.A. , but I do n't remember every frame of it to be one of the people who will inevitably show up here and say they were disappointed because the color correction of this or that scene was too cool or too warm , etc . compared to `` the way it 's supposed to be . '' They may be right , they may be wrong . But certainly nothing jumped out at me or ruined the experience.The Blu-ray is available alone or in a 50th Anniversary set , which is what I got . The Anniversary packaging is very nice and the book looks great , though I 've only browsed through it so far . And I have n't had time to watch any of the extras yet though I did watch part of the film with the information pop-ups and they were pretty good.I could not be happier with how good this movie looks on Blu !	1
Peter O'Toole is the enigmatic T.E . Lawrence . It is an indelible performance . The entire film is mesmerizing and captivating from the opening to final shot . This is David Lean 's masterpiece . Maurice Jarre 's score is a true classic evoking images that are eternally grained into our memories .	1
One of the pleasures of my current job is that I selecting movies for this various film series I run . My current series is `` 100 Years , 100 Movies : Selections From the American Film Institute , '' and while I do n't have the rights to screen EVERY selection , the many that I have gotten to show have initiated a good deal of discussion and debate among my attendees as to what makes a film a classic.Even at a glance at the AFI 's roster of classic films , it was pretty clear that a wide variety of subjects , styles and genres would be open to us . Greatness does n't come in a one-size-fit-all format . We began our series with CASABLANCA , certainly a classic of its era -- but one that caught its audience , the critics and , yes , even the actors and filmmakers by surprise . Shot in elegant black-and-white , CASABLANCA is not quite an example of film noir -- but it does have its ` noirish ' aspects . And by the standards of the day , it was not actually a low-budget venture , but still no one involved in the project realized they were making a classicYou could say that lack of pretention proven to be part of the beauty of the film . It 's one of the big screen 's little ironies that it is often that very lack of pretention that makes for classic cinema . And just as frequently , the bigger , more epic productions turn out to be bloated , boring and sometimes ludicrously bad.But not always . Cinema can do many things , and in the right hands , a screen epic can be a wondrous thing to behold . British director David Lean ( 1908-1991 ) is generally considered one of the masters of mid-20th century epic cinema ( with such films to his credit as BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI , DR. ZHIVAGO , and especially LAWRENCE OF ARABIA , hailed as the best epic film of all time by the American Film Institute , the magazine Total Film and many others critics , film societies and publications.Aside from the twenty years -- and all the attendant technical advancements between 1942 and 1962 -- that separated CASABLANCA and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA , the two films do have a number of points in common : both speak to a certain fascination with exotic locales , the machinations and intrigues of war , and both pose questions about the nature of heroism and sacrifice . And is it just coincidence , that both feature veteran character actor Claude Rains in co-starring roles ? ( Who knows ? Maybe David Lean was indulging in a subtle kind of `` stunt casting . `` ) LAWRENCE OF ARABIA remains one of the most widely respected and influential films ever made . While some have questioned its historical accuracy , others have championed its cinematic beauty ( and , yes , this is definitely one to view in letterbox format ) .Its visual style has influenced directors as diverse as Martin Scorsese , Sam Peckinpah and George Lucas . You ca n't get more diverse than that , and that very roster gives you an idea of how the notion of `` epic cinema '' has expanded over the decades.The film is also noted for its literate screenplay ( another trait it shares with CASABLANCA and so many other `` classic films '' ) and for Peter O'Toole 's impressive star turn in the title role . O'Toole had appeared in smaller roles in three movies prior to making this film . Interestingly , hewas not the first choice for the part , but Marlon Brando was not available , and Albert Finney turned down the role . Producer Sam Spiegel had worked with O'Toole previously and was n't eager to work with the Irish born actor again . He did , however , yield to director Lean 's better judgment -- and the rest , as they say , is movie history.It 's ironic that the film many consider to be the greatest epic of all time was made in the era ( the early ` 60s ) when the genre could be said to be winding down . ( But as suggested by the list of filmmakers who 've felt LAWRENCE 's influence , MAYBE the genre was just being redefined ) . It was clear even then that the days of lengthy , grandiose film with a `` cast of thousands , '' and actual intermissions were on the wane.It probably can be said in more recent years , `` epics '' tend to be more in the sci-fi and fantasy realm , with the vert occasional historical filmsurfacing from time to time . It 's ironic that the film many think of as the cinema 's GREATEST epic was -- in a technical sense anyway -- one of the last true examples of the genre . It probably had a lot to do with budgets , and with changing public tastes . But then took , maybe LAWRENCE OF ARABIA just set too high a bar .	1
*This review refers to the 2-disc blu-ray release*Just watching the first few minute of the blu-ray version of `` Lawrence of Arabia '' toldme the remainder of the movie would be fantastic and it was.Sound quality is superb and never has it been clearer . Background noisesare easily distinguished well not overpowering the vocal tracks.The image is superb and it shows a studio dedicated to getting it right . Just enough grainand the colors really pop out . I have seen various versions of `` Lawrence of Arabia '' on DVD , TV , and VHSand the blu-ray release outdoes them all easily . I say ref . quality.Easily my best blu-ray purchase thus far this year and certainly one of the bestmovies ever was given the due it deserves . The interview with Peter O'Toole wasquit good along with the `` making of '' which was slightly over an hour in length.If you love the movie and have a blu-ray player this is a must purchase in my opinion .	1
My review is limited to the quality of the DVD transfer of the single disc version of `` Lawrence of Arabia '' . There are other editions of this film ( special editions , etc . ) but the single disc is a real bargain . The remastering of this film as presented in the single disc version is simply fantastic . Viewed on my 46-inch LCD high definition TV ( via a Toshiba HD DVD player ) , the picture and sound are stunning ! The picture is sharp and clear and the colors are rich and accurate . If your main interest is the film itself ( and you can do without all of the extra features found on other DVD editions of this movie ) -- -then the single disc version is a real bargain for this masterpiece .	1
The Blu-ray edition of Lawrence of Arabia is spectacular in every way . The first impression is sonic , with the overture by French composer Maurice Jarre played over a blank screen , soon followed by truly astounding images from the deserts of Arabia ( actually Jordan and Morocco ) . The clarity , minute detail and brilliant color of the picture made it difficult to believe I was watching a fifty-year-old film . Every facet of the filmmaker 's art is showcased here at an extreme level of competence and inspiration . Lawrence of Arabia 's revered status with film fans can only be further enhanced by this high definition re-mastering.British director David Lean had long wanted to do a production based on T.E . Lawrence 's autobiography , The Seven Pillars of Wisdom , but the anticipated scope and consequent cost of the film were prohibitive . With the success of his 1957 Bridge On the River Kwai ( Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor Alec Guinness ) the necessary funding became available . The story of Lawrence , his Arab cavalry and their campaign against the Turks on the desert fringe of the First World War would come to the screen . The effort and expense were rewarded with another raft of Oscars for 1962 , including Best Picture , Director , Cinematography , Editing , Musical Score , Art Direction and Sound.Two of the ten special features are exclusive to the Blu-ray , one being an interview with Peter O'Toole many years after the film was made . The other exclusive feature , the only special feature on the disc with the film itself , is called Picture in Graphics - Secrets of Arabia . I was not enthused , thinking this would be a mere gallery of production photographs , but it turned out to be a very special device for students of the history of film or of T.E . Lawrence . It is an extensive combination of commentary , maps and historic photographs . These are all intercut and superimposed on live action from the film , from opening scene to closing credits , including soundtrack . Have you ever wondered while watching a fact-based film , `` how valid is this depiction ? '' Well , here 's your chance to find out . This extra feature offers superb detail , allowing one to construct a more nearly complete and accurate story . Scene after scene , the events , locations , actors and characters are commented upon . For example , we find out that the two boys who attached themselves to Lawrence as servants in fact existed , and both died in the course of the war , but not under the circumstances depicted in the film.This is a superb Blu-ray production , fully worthy of an exceptional film .	1
This is an epic and powerful tale , both an international political thriller and an interpersonal drama about the amazing character T.E . Lawrence . Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece that manages to impart an important history lesson in addition to some outstanding cinematography , brilliant acting by Peter O'Toole , Omar Sharif , Anthony Quinn , and Sir Alec Guinness , beautiful landscape vistas , many quotable exchanges , and an intense character study of the conflicted T.E . Lawrence.Lawrence of Arabia is famous for its length , and having heard so much about the duration of the film , I was concerned about my own attention span . To my surprise and delight , the movie was never plodding or drawn out . Every scene served an important function . Even the long desert-passage tale was purposeful , conveying to the viewer just how arduous and trying the journey was.Despite its well-deserved critical acclaim and historical significance , Lawrence of Arabia is not without its drawbacks . It has a mediocre soundtrack , some laughable special effects ( the quicksand scene ) , and night scenes that are fuzzy due to the lack of proper lenses and equipment . I think the film is even greater due to these warts and imperfections . Some reviewers have commented that the lack of any credible female characters ( outside some tribeswomen in a group shot ) is a drawback , but I could n't disagree more . The lack of a female lead makes the movie great , because it is realistic , and not contrived to some Hollywood standard movie formula . Where do women fit into an early 1900 's war , into a culture that oppresses women , and into the life of a homosexual military man ? The filmmakers should be applauded for not trying to fit a female lead into a movie which is about men.This is one of the all-time best movies in American cinema . Do n't miss out on this outstanding DVD release .	1
Just love these old movies . This one is a classic and one of Peter O'Tooles best . you ca n't go wrong with him .	1
i was totally hesitant to watch this movie some years ago but when i came upon owning a widescreen director 's cut of the movie , i decided to watch it . it 's everything it 's cracked up to be . excellent directino by lean , great acting , excellent script . the long running time is well worth the watch . i highly recommend	1
This 1962 film is based on the true story of the unconventional British Lieutenant , who , during WW1 , united Arab tribes to fight on the British side against the Turks . How Lawrence did that was the result of his weird combination of charisma and craziness . And how director , David Lean , brought this epic to the screen is a result of pure genius . Filmed on location in Jordan , the desert comes alive for the viewer . It 's mile after mile after mile of drifting sand . But it also has places where there are lots of little rocks . And then there are the few and far-between oases and wells . There 's danger here too , both because of the bitter tribal rivalries as well as natural dangers such as quicksand . The camel is the accepted mode of transportation . And thirst is something that the Bedouins learned to live with . It 's a harsh life . The film is full of adventure . And not just because of the characters or the action . There 's the adventure of the desert itself , and how a small speck on the horizon comes out of a mirage and becomes a human being . This all comes alive by a vision , one that had never been done on screen before . It was an ambitious undertaking . And a huge success.The acting was outstanding . And so were all the special effects , although the cast of thousands who were real live people . It 's a refreshing difference to computer-generated scenes we 've become accustomed to . And a type of filming that we will not likely see again . For that alone , the film stands as a testament to human ingenuity . A couple of details bothered me , such as the makeup on Peter O'Toole whose fair skin was supposed to look sunburned , but somehow looked as if he had thick clay on his face . But this was minor . I also thought the film was too long and missed a traditional arc of plot which I 've come to expect . I found myself drowsing off during the last half hour as it all seemed repetitive and superfluous to what had come before.I watched all the DVD special features the next morning . And they were wonderful . It was then I realized that the print I had watched had been restored in 1989 , with 35 minutes added to the epic . Some of the sound had been lost at that time and I found it fascinating as to how they brought back the actors to dub in their own voices again . I love learning about all the background and hearing the actors talk about the experience . Do n't miss this wonderful DVD . Just make sure that you give yourself enough time to watch the film in its entirety . And add on another couple of hours to see the special features . You 'll come away with an experience of your own that goes beyond merely watching a film . Clearly , it rates one of my highest recommendations .	1
This movie was fantastic ! the acting and the imagery was superb . peter o'toole-whom i had never seen in a movie previously-gives a fantastic performance . History is intertwined with biography in the film-from WWI and the the Sykes-Picot agreement to Lawrence 's assimilation into Arabic tribal culture to his relationship with Ali ... This movie politely and tastefully touches on the subject of Lawrence 's discreet homosexuality ( after all , the film was made in 1962 . ) A great epic , beautiful and accurate . However , after seeing this film I do think that sloppily made inaccurate movies like Oliver Stone 's Alexander-which is a bastardization of history-should be shot out of a cannon .	1
Lawrence of Arabia is one of the finest films ever made . It lacks a happy ending , but it is one of the most beautiful , sweeping , romantic , thought-provoking , historically accurate , and realistic epics ever made . If you can believe Lawrence was Peter O'Toole 's first film , and that he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar and DID N'T GET IT - then you will have an idea of the sad feeling you have at the end . David Lean directed this film , five years after he directed the Bridge on the River Kwai . Lawrence 's cinematography and music are sublime . There are many , many very good actors in minor roles.The film tells the true story of T.E . Lawrence , a British officer who was stationed in the Middle East during WWI . Lawrence donned sheik 's robes and led fractious nomadic tribes in a successful revolt against the Turks . The unusual army destroyed Turkish rail lines and drove them out of their stronghold in Akaba , paving the way for the British army to come in.Lawrence was enchanted by the harsh simplicity of the desert , and had a genuine love and respect for the desert tribes . He wanted the desert to belong to the Arabs , but constant warring among tribes and imperialist intervention crushed his dream . He returned to England disillusioned and bitter . For more information , Lawrence 's book `` Seven Pillars of Wisdom , '' published in 1922 . Seven Pillars details his experiences in the desert with the nomadic warriors , and the revolt . David Lean , the film 's director , based the film almost entirely on this book.In the film , O'Toole plays the strange and unique Lawrence perfectly . O'Toole 's intense blue , searching eyes , his handsomeness and his golden hair lend to create and immortalize the mythic figure of this warrior-poet . One thing you know right away is that they broke the mold when they made Lawrence . O'Toole seems lost in the British military compound , and comes alive in the punishing environment of the desert . His brave and courageous acts leads a sheik to become his friends . Omar Sharif plays Ali . His tribe follows Lawrence through `` the sun 's anvil '' on a risky mission to add a band of brigands to their army . The leader of the tribe of brigands , Auda , is played by Anthony Quinn.The scenes up until Lawrence 's capture and abuse by Turks are glorious and inspiring . El Aurents , as the nomads call him , is the Braveheart of the Desert . But as in Braveheart , as in war , things can not always end as they begin . Herein lies the heartache of war . A scene where Lawrence loses his mind and takes it out on bedraggled injured Turks is incredibly painful to watch , considering all that has come before.Sharif is so passionate , and an incredible actor . He is Lawrence 's sole support and it is painful to watch his grief as his friend slips into depression and madness . Like O'Toole , he too had an Oscar snatched out of his hand .	1
For the price I paid for this classic movie , it was a steal . I have this movie in VHS . I was waiting for the price of the Blue Ray version to come down . What a price drop| Very satisfied .	1
This film is a well deserved 7 Oscar winner . A huge production effort , 10 M dollars in 1962 was a record . To fully appreciate this opus , you should see it in a theater , no doubt , but if that is not possible do n't miss it . VHS or DVD will allow you to taste many of the great features of this movie.First : a collection of actors performing in an unusual high level : Peter O'Toole as Lawrence , Omar Shariff as Sheriff Ali , Jack Hawkins as General Allenby , Anthony Quinn as Auda abu Tayi , Alec Guinness as King Feisal.Not only those performances are outstanding , lots of secondary characters are also paramount : the two kids that followed Lawrence , Michael Ray as Farraj and John Dimech as Daud ; the uncredited Turk soldier that holds Lawrence while he is whipped , gives an unforgettable expression , in a scene that takes no more than three minutes ; the first Bedouin guide to Lawrence ( Zia Mohyeddin ) ; the British officers showing their elitist attitudes ; almost all performances are remarkable one way or the other.Second : the music score of Maurice Jarre with some remarkable compositions that remain as a trade mark of the movie.The more than beautiful photography from Freddie Young ( with an extended career that include more than 130 films ) , desert pictures are overwhelming , both winning Oscar.Third : the film director , David Lean ( also Oscar winner ) , directs with the same allure mass battle scenes and intimate dialogues between Ali and Lawrence , Feisal and Lawrence among others . No doubt he influenced the generalized high quality of actor 's performance.Fourth : the story a forceful recreation of a critical war period with its political implications ( still unresolved after almost 90 years ) . The intimate description of Lawrence divided loyalties : to Arab Cause and to British Empire . Of Lawrence 's spiritual suffering : he was an intellectual and a mystic thrown in the middle of a bloody war conflict and having to lead human beings to death , suffering and destruction . Lawrence 's internals contradictions : he enjoyed killing a man ; afterwards , he was incapable to refrain his vengeance desires . His failure to fulfill his promises . All this kaleidoscopic emotions are shown by Peter O'Toole with a compromise rarely seen ; he gives real flesh and blood to his historical character.There are some minor historical inaccuracies ( poetic licenses may we say ? ) , King Feisal is shown as an elder man ; in reality he was only a couple of years older than young Lawrence . Peter O'Toole was ( approximately ) 6 feet high ( or 1.80 meters ) and Lawrence was ( approximately ) 5 feet 3 inches high ( or 1.65 meters ) , this is in a way minimized by how O'Toole managed his corporal demeanor.An unforgettable film ! ! ! Reviewed by Max Yofre .	1
Best looking Blu Ray for a classic film . The film is epic . There is no other way to describe it . This is David Lean 's masterpiece . And Peter Toole 's performance as Lawrence is as legendary as the man himself . 4K restoration looks spectacular . See the landscapes , the color in full glory on the widest screen you can . Plus at an amazingly low price . Highest recommendation .	1
I first remember seeing `` Lawrence of Arabia '' in 1971 when a bunch of us college students went to see the cut-up ( actually butchered ) version of it in a small theater . I may have seen it when it first came out because I still have the movie program but I do n't remember ( I was 11 or 12 ) . I was more into James Bond and Ray Harryhausen films than three hour epics . However , I do remember going with some people that I worked with to see the restored version in 1989 at the Cinema 21 in Mission Valley . We were spoiled in San Diego because we had not one , but six stand-alone movie theatres that could show 70mm films like `` Lawrence '' . Sadly , four have been torn down while the other two were turned into a Staples and Bookstar ( respectively ) . I mention this because you do n't get to experience the real impact of `` Lawrence '' unless you see it in a theatre that can handle 70mm films . In fact , the last 70mm film I saw was Kenneth Branagh 's version of `` Hamlet '' ( 1996 ) and prior to that was Ron Howard 's `` Far and Away ' ( 1992 ) . They just do n't make films in this format anymore . Lean used it one more time for `` Ryan 's Daughter '' ( 1970 ) but he he went back to 35mm for `` Doctor Zhivago '' ( 1965 ) and `` A Passage to India '' ( 1984 ) . I mention all this because going to the movies , at least when I was young , was an event . I still remember seeing `` The Ten Commandments '' ( 1956 ) and `` Ben-Hur '' ( 1959 ) and being taken away by the scope of the production . With this new restored version of `` Lawrence '' finally making it to Blu Ray at least everyone can enjoy what it was like seeing it for the first time ( aspect rato of 2:20:1 ) even though it 's on a flat screen TV . Once you get carried away with the scope of the film , it feels like you 're seeing it on a large screen . This Blu Ray is stunning to say the least and the restoration team at Sony deserves at lot of credit for the hard work they put into it just in time for it 's 50th Anniversary . Having been to many of the locations in Jordan and Spain where Lean filmed most of the picture , I can honestly say that this Blu Ray feels like you 're actually there . I 'm not going to go into detail because there are other reviewers who can cover that better than me , but if you 're a serious collector of films then you need to have this in your collection . David Lean 's films are perfect subjects for Blu Ray and with this release all of his films since `` Bridge on the River Kwai '' ( 1957 ) until `` A Passage to India '' ( his last in 1984 ) have now been issued on Blu Ray . The only exception is `` Ryan 's Daughter '' and hopefully Warner Home Video will get around to that in the future . This Sony release of `` Lawrence of Arabia '' is definately on my list for one of the top Blu Ray releases of 2012 along with Paramount 's `` To Catch a Thief '' , Criteron 's `` Rosemary 's Baby '' , Warner 's `` Empire of the Sun '' and Universal 's `` Classic Monsters Box Set '' . For those who love great filmmaking , enjoy `` Lawrence of Arabia '' in all it 's Blu Ray glory .	1
It is , without a doubt , one of the greatest movie ever made . The story , as implausible as it may seem , did happen . The timeless conflicts of the Middle East were shown in all its splendor and , although made in 1956 , David Lean work of art is still unsurpassed for its magnificence . If you have to own just 3 videos , this must be one of them . It is that good . The story is absorbing but the filming is amazing !	1
Imagine my surprise ( and delight ) when last weekend for Father 's Day my son presented this gift box to me as a Father 's Day present . He knows I am a movie buff , but I certainly did not expect him to spend his hard-earned money on such a lavish gift ( thanks Rick ! ) . I literally had not seen this movie in several decades , and could n't wait to see it again and check out the bonus materials . `` Lawrence of Arabia ( 50th Anniversary Collector 's Edition ) '' ( 3 Blue-ray discs , 1 CD , 1 book ) presents the movie in all of its former visual glory , and then some . What a delight it was to see this again . The richness of the colors on this Blue-ray edition are nothing short of stunning , making this movie now eye-candy from start to finish . The movie certainly does not feel it is now 50 years old . Could n't help but think as I was watching it whether it would uberhaupt be possible for a movie like taht to be made today , if nothing else because of cost considerations . As to the 2 discs with bonus materials , let me just make a couple of comments on Disc 3 , which is exclusive to this collectors box : there is a nice feature ( `` Lawrence At 50 : A Classic Restored '' ) from Sony on how they restored this movie via 4K restoration . The comments from Martin Scorsese are , as always , enjoyable and insighful . There is a great 1963 feature called `` Wind , Sand and Star '' , with footage from the set focusing primarily on Peter O'Toole . But the cherry on the cake is a fatastic 90 min . documetary from 2000 called `` In Love With the Desert '' , in which Eddie Fowler , the original outdoor set designer , takes us back to the locations where the movie was shot in Jordan , Spain and Morocco , 40 years later . It makes me want to visit Seville in Spain badly ! The CD ( 16 tracks ; 42 min . ) brings the epic soundtrack to the movie , and is a very nice item to have ( I have been playing this in my car this past week ) . Last but not least , there is a coffee table book as well , which again is heavy on the visuals . In all , I can not even begin to express how utterly and completely pleased I am with this 50th anniversary collector 's box edition of `` Lawrence of Arabia '' . And that I got this as a Father 's Day gift , makes this even more special for me . HIGHLY , HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !	1
This is the greatest movie I have ever seen . Not only is it superb filmmaking , but the film touches on a personal level I never expected to feel . David Lean 's WW1 epic follows the both heroic and tragic military campaign of T.E . Lawrence ( Peter O'Toole in an Oscar-nominated role ) . When we first see Lawrence interact with others , he comes off as a bumbling fool , but his encyclopedic knowledge of the world earns him his first significant mission -- - find Arab Prince Feisal , and learn of the Arabs ' intentions . Whatever he learns will help the British campaign function more effectively for their own purposes . However , after meeting Feisal and his Sherif Ali , Lawrence instead becomes the central figure in the campaign by uniting the Arabs against the Turkish Empire , rather than report back to his British superiors.Make no mistake - `` Lawrence of Arabia '' is NOT a war film . There is glory of combat here ; the battle sequences are brief and not very well-choreographed . But that 's because Lean does n't want us to see Lawrence 's aim-and-shoot techniques . No , instead Lean smartly stays on his facial expressions -- O'Toole 's behavior tells the story better than a battle 's body count . When an enemy fort is overtaken , the `` battle '' is simply a camera pan of horses charging in . We do n't need to witness an elaborate sequence because we only need to know that the Arabs defeated the Turks . `` Lawrence of Arabia '' is almost 4 hours , but is stripped to its essentials like those who dwell in its deserts.The film features a wonderful cast of supporting characters . Alec Guinness reteams with David Lean to play Prince Feisal , a leader of patient wisdom and admiration for Lawrence 's passion . Omar Sharif made a star-making American debut ( and Oscar-nominated performance ) as Sherif Ali , whose strong loyalty to Lawrence also brings him immense pain when his friend is also suffering . Lawrence and Ali are as equal as they are opposite ; Sharif 's chemistry with O'Toole is perfect.The most obvious acheivement of `` Lawrence of Arabia '' is the cinematography and Lean 's direction . Orson Welles `` Citizen Kane '' is a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but Lean overshadows that classic with more color and vivid imagery . There are too many genius shots to praise . The mirage sequence is the most famous , in which Ali 's figure begins as a speck , but then rides ever so closer on a camel with no music ... but haunting silence ! Or when Lawrence is just assigned his mission : he looks at a burning match , exhales so gently ... and the camera quick-cuts to a beautiful sunset in the Arabian desert . We witness the harsh realities of desert warfare , but do n't actually see much blood or corpses . Instead , stirring dialogue and tracking shots get a strong enough reaction that the guns and casualties do n't really matter.The dialogue is sharp enough to rival `` Casablanca '' or `` Pulp Fiction '' . Screenwriter Robert Bolt 's dialogue is so truthful , poetic , and eloquent -- it 's a thrill just to hear these characters 'speak ' . The scenes involving strategy and tactics are n't glorious declarations of brilliance ; instead , they 're more like verbal chess matches between stubborn parties . For example : an Arab Bureau liaison , Dryden ( Claude Rains at his smarmiest ) , is devilishly manipulative . However , Rains ' tonation is neutral yet wicked . When a reporter asks Dryden what happened during a secret meeting , he casually replies `` Oh ... nothing ... nothing at all . '' His lies are so obvious , telling us he intentionally rubs the secrecy in his adversaries ' faces.Another remarkable acheivement is Maurice Jarre 's music score . Simply put , it 's amazing and legendary ! Thankfully , the DVD keeps the 4 and 1/2 minute Overture , Intermission , and Exit Music . For those unfamiliar , when cinematic epics played in movie theatres , music was played before the movie began . It helped audiences settle in and get ready for the film to begin . There were no images on the screen , but the music just played . The filmmakers took great pride in the best presentation possible for a film that took about 2 years to make . `` Lawrence of Arabia '' is as much as pleasure to listen to as it to watch it.Another point on the main character - credit for the portrayal of T.E . Lawrence belongs equally to the entire production team . Bolt knew how to write him , Lean knew how to shoot him , Jarre knew what music to write for him , Anne Coates knew how to properly edit and pace his character , and O'Toole knew how the play him . This strong collaberation of artists results in a rarity : we , the audience , can relate to a historical figure who a total 'enigma ' . As presented in the film , T.E . Lawrence was a man of dual-willed dilemmas . He keeps unfathomable promises , but lacks the heart to be satisfied . He 's a central war figure who inspires many , but eventually rejects his talents.As I said earlier , the character is collaborative effore - I forgot to mention the supporting characters who give their take on this bizarre man . They , I believe , is the heart of the film . One of the opening scenes reveals differing opinions on Lawrence 's legacy . A reporter calls him a `` shameless exhibitionist '' , while a British soldier calls him `` a very great man '' . But is there any truth is what any of these men say ? And if so , do they have enough credibility to even have an opinion ? T.E . Lawrence ( according the film ) never really knew who he was or what he really wanted . Because of that confusing shell , his outcast reputation strengthed his ego to accomplish daring feats like crossing an endless desert , but also deeply hurt those closest to him ( and those who only wanted his talents ) . `` Lawrence of Arabia '' is a one-of-a-kind experience . It has powerful music , unforgettable camera shots , beautiful dialogue , jaw-dropping images , spectacular sequences , stellar acting , and historical significance ! There will never be a greater cinema epic than `` Lawrence of Arabia '' ... DVD NOTESThere are two versions of this movie on DVD.1 ) A One-Disc version that has no Special Features . That is worth a purchase alone , because you can watch the film in one sitting.2 ) This Limited Edition DVD splits the movie into two halves . The video and audio quality appear to be the same , but the 2-Disc release has full-motion menus with music , whereas the other version only has freeze-frame menus . The second Disc includes an outstanding making-of documentary , some comments from Steven Spielberg on the restoration , and a few neat promotional materials . Seeing thses artists work themselves tirelessly for 2 years will only further your appreciation for this movie . Even if you do n't share my praise for the film , you will admire the patience and hard work that everybody invested into it . This was not one man 's vision ; `` Lawrence of Arabia '' is collage of brilliant filmmakers and artists composing an unforgettable tale ! I 've often heard people say one film is their 'favorite ' , but then they say another is the 'greatest ' . To me , my all-time favorite and standard of greatness are the same film . Watch this film immediately !	1
This movie is by far one the greatest of all films . This is largely due in part to its superior screenplay and dialogue . The movie is loaded with various motiffs and symbols . The overall theme of the movie is the psychological transformation of T.E . Lawrence . The switch of personalities between Lawrence and Ali is all too apparent . Lawrence after all , suffers an identity crisis throughout the film . Lawrence first starts off as a humble soldier . Once he undergoes his mission to `` appreciate the situation '' he states that he will accomplish a `` miracle '' which he eventually does . From there he compares himself to Moses as he crosses Sinai . He eventually goes so far as to compare himself to Christ as he walks in splendor and transfigured white on top of the train . He shortly thereafter states that he will `` walk on water '' . He however not only comes back down to earth , but he sinks to the bottom , covered with mud and filth after his rape by the Turks . He even goes so far as to cover himself with a filthy cloak . He however can not cover the bloody scars on his back ( this is about as close to Christ as he gets ) , which are a result of the Turks ' torture.I will not proceed to describe the rest of the deep elements of the movie . Just bare in mind that the movie begins with a motorcycle and ends with one . The more you see the film the more you will love and understand it . It is this quality which sets movies apart . Those who claim the movie is boring are those who do not `` appreciate the situation '' . They need to read more literature .	1
I have seen this masterpiece many many times , but only after reading T.E . Lawrence 's book & quot ; The Seven Pillars of Wisdom & quot ; this year do I now begin to understand . This movie is a product of two of the century 's greatest minds , one an author and soldier , the other a film maker . The power of Lawrence 's descriptions of the desert matches the great cinematography . No film could fully project the power of the inner thoughts of this most introspective man ; for that you absolutely need the book to fill in the gaps . Many of the scenes take on a much deeper meaning once you have read the book in detail . The Columbia Tri-Star two-DVD edition is faultless , something I will always treasure . I find it hard to believe that someday a better movie could possibly be made , but we can hope against hope .	1
Lawrence of Arabia ( David Lean , 1962 ) There has been a good deal of debate recently among bloggers and critics of my generation and that below me -- the new critics , as it were -- about the `` old '' critics ' 100-best lists and the rather heavy concentration in them of `` old '' movies ( for the purposes of this argument , we 'll define `` old '' as `` made before 1970 '' -- at least for the movies ) , and that when new movies do make the list , they are , by and large , foreign films . When you expand to critics ' thousand-best lists , where one might think to find a good deal more new films , the trend actually gets more pronounced . The basis of the argument is that new movies deserve just as much respect as old ones . There 's certainly some validity to this point ; good movies are made every year . However , I do n't think simple nostalgia is the sole basis for this seeming prejudice ; let 's face it , the film industry in the English-speaking world has changed dramatically in the past forty years . Case in point : try to imagine Columbia , or any other major Hollywood studio , releasing , or even greenlighting , David Lean 's magnificent Lawrence of Arabia today -- a war film that comes in just shy of four hours , with as much ( if not more ) emphasis on the development of two of its main characters as there is actual action . I 'm pretty sure any studio exec seeing this script on his desk today would have a cow , or at least a goat . I read an amusing article by Ken Russell today where he calls this mindset the butt factor -- how long a person 's butt can stay in a cinema seat before it goes numb -- and he notes that where Hollywood is concerned , the butt factor is about two hours . He implies , by linking this to some of his older films ( 1969 's Women in Love and 1971 's The Devils -- both of which , it should be noted , are regular entrants on those thousand-best lists ) , that the butt factor had been two hours in Hollywood studios for quite some time now . Ah , but such was not the case , thank heaven , in 1962.To film his life of T. E. Lawrence , David Lean rounded up a stable of well-known , well-loved actors ( including Alec Guinness , Anthony Quinn , Claude Rains , and Jose Ferrer , among many others ) , and then set atop them two relative unknowns : Peter O'Toole , in his first big-screen appearance , and Egyptian actor Omar Sharif , none of whose films had , at the time , been released in America or England . A surprising move , perhaps , and I have little doubt there was carping at the studio over using two unknowns in the top slots of what was to be a lavish , expensive effort . Lean knew what he was doing , though , as history has borne out ; O'Toole , nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for this film , snagged his seventh Oscar nomination ( all seven , interestingly , have been for Best Actor ) in 2006 , while Sharif , also Oscar-nominated for his role here , has become a legend both on the screen and at the card table . Between them , the movie 's principal actors account for thirty-two Oscar nominations over the years , with four wins ; not bad , not bad at all . The movie itself won only seven of the ten Oscars for which it was nominated , with both O'Toole and Sharif missing out ( losing to Gregory Peck and Ed Begley , respectively ) . Still , Best Director , Best Cinematography , Best Picture , not a bad haul.Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies where you do n't have to get it to get it . You do n't have to notice that almost all the action in the film goes from left to right for your subconscious to figure it out and attach meaning to it . You do n't have to notice the incredible cinematography , for which at least one custom lens was developed . All you have to do is sit back and watch two great actors at work . O'Toole 's Lawrence may not have won the Oscar , but AFI called his Lawrence the finest screen performance of all time ; I 'm not sure I 'd go quite that far , but to say it 's impressive would be greatly understating the case . Equally impressive is Sharif 's Ali , but the interplay between them is more than the sum of its parts . Lean and screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson never let the viewer assume that the friendship between Lawrence and Ali is on firm ground , even when one is risking his life for the other ; both are complex characters , and their relationship reflects all the pressures , both internal and external , on each of them.That 's not the only reason to watch this movie , of course . It is expertly paced ; the crossing of the Nefud , which takes up the bulk of the second quarter of the film , flies by . Who knew that a bunch of guys on camels picking their way over rocks could be compelling ? David Lean did , I guess , and we should thank him for giving us as much of it as he did.An amazing , beautiful piece of work that must be seen to be believed . ****	1
I love this movie , it is one of my favourites . I first saw it in pan and scan , and that could never do it justice . Wide screen and blu-ray is the way to go .	1
You would n't want to miss any of this classic . Especially if you have a DVD player and can watch it in widescreen format.This is easily one of the most beautiful films ever made . The scenes are photographed spectacularly . David Lean had the eye of an artist , and it shows in his films . The desert is a major character in the film and it is both beautiful and hellish.The acting is top-notch throughout . Peter O'Toole 's breakthrough performance as T.E . Lawrence is something to behold , and he 's in almost every scene . He goes from the gumpy-frumpy , cartographer Lieutenant in the English army to a legendary Arab military leader who helped free the Arabs land from the Turks during WWI . The supporting cast includes a number of actors who were stars and soon-to-be stars , including Claude Rains , Anthony Quinn , Omar Sharif , and Jose Ferrer . Also significant is the almost total lack of females in the film . We briefly see a few nurses and the silhouettes of some Bedouin women , but no central female characters.The music also plays a large part in the experience . The score by Maurice Jarre is grand and perfect for the film . And it all sounds great in updated Dolby Digital audio.The word that best describes this film has to be spectacular . The cinematography . The acting . The story . The score . It was originally released in 1962 . Sometimes the age is obvious in films like this , but Lawrence holds up so well , it has to be considered timeless . It 's awesome to watch and a must-have for film lovers . The extras include a good hour+ documentary .	1
I 've had two editions , first the LV , then the DVD . This Blu-ray is supposedly a further `` restoration '' of the film , and is magnificent . The non-desert sequences have a color richness ( not just saturation ) I 've never seen . Sharpness and detail are exemplary . ( Note the printing on Bentley 's business card . ) `` Lawrence of Arabia '' actually /looks/ as if was shot on 65mm film.My only complaint is that some scenes show vertical yellow-green streaks . No explanation is given , but this is presumably damage caused by desert heat or lab errors . One wonders whether an attempt was made to reduce them to invisibility.Some people have complained about sound levels . The British typically mix for `` natural '' voice levels , rather than trying to maintain balance with the rest of the sounds . This can be highly annoying , especially on TV shows where it can be hard to understand what the actors are saying ( qv , `` Rumpole of the Bailey '' ) . In `` Lawrence '' , the difference between quiet voices and the loudest music is /so/ wide that you need speakers that can play at high volumes without sounding strained or distorted . `` One of the greats '' ( and an obvious forerunner of another Oscar-winner about going native ) . An essential part of any movie library.PS : The young'uns might wonder why Feisel has such a familiar voice . Do n't tell them .	1
Robert Harris spent two years assembling the restored version we have been so graciously bestowed with only too recently . there was no original negative even ... only hacked and re-hacked-hacked for/from TV versions . he had to go thru hundreds of negatives in order to restore the full , theatrical + uncut + widescreen version ... editors never seem to get credit where there is SOOOOO much we owe them , ESPECIALLY IN THE EDUCATED DIGITAL ERA WE EXIST IN TODAY.having said that , i can now feel free to speak on the work itself . David Lean , i thank you for being alive . Peter O'Toole , thank you for putting your all into this film ... et al . /bowthis is the tale of actuation of the soul and the spirit of man . it is treacherous and yet as desolate and bleak as the desert . the man and the desert are one , before they even meet ... they collide like a spiritual highway pile-up . This film is the closest i 've ever experienced to capturing the universalism ideal and also the concept of man breaking the boundries and freeing himself in order to allow the explosion of actuation occur . while dealing with all this weight , he finds that the same door opens to the horrifying reality of human carnal lust . Lawerence exists with his fear of truly finding himself only to find that he loses himself at the same time ; becoming enlightened and elated but only to find that he can view it with a detached heart ... the macro and microcosm of true being.a man finds a thing only to lose it . and in losing it , has he ever known having had a thing.please excuse my feeble attempt to express what this film reveals . i am only a man and these concepts are better felt than explained.if i could give one thing to mankind and have them all understand like i wish they would , it would be this film.and so , i leave the rest of you ...	1
Lizzy is unmistakably elegant in any of the 254 episodes of the series and her delightful personality carries the whole show throughout all 8 seasons .	1
I like The Swan Princess III and the Mystery of the Enchanted Treasure . It 's a cool movie . I like the fact that Rothbart appeared in this movie .	1
They like the way the princess gets transform as a swan they enjoy it and have fun watching it is great	1
As far as overall viewing quality , this is the best recorded version of & quot ; 1776 & quot ; to day . Yes , it 's missing some bits from the play , but that 's ok for now . It 's still a great improvement over the original classic film release.It is incredible the amount of painstaking research that went into the creation of a musical . Not only is it fun to watch , but the history follows the true story of the struggle for independance closer than any movie I have ever seen ! I read someone who whined that it belittles the Declaration of Independance since the only reason it was written was so Jefferson could & quot ; have marital relations & quot ; with his wife . They were n't watching the same film I was . He did n't want to because he was basiclly a newlywed when he got called to congress and was scheduled to go home to finally have his honeymoon ! Adams DID send for Jefferson 's wife as thanks to the sacrifice he made because Jefferson knew the importance of what had to be done , and as Adams put it & quot ; No one can write better than you , Jefferson & quot ; . The arguments on slavery were accurate , if not tamed a bit to avoid criticism for & quot ; trying to make a statement & quot ; where the truth actually echoed reality.Read the book , see the play , get the soundtrack , love the movie ! Will I be happier if they someday release a & quot ; complete edition & quot ; like the laserdisc years ago ? If they can get this quality , then ABSOLUTELY . Otherwise , I would n't mind the supplimental , but this will do for now .	1
I 'm not sure which DVD the reviewer below was looking at , but at least half of the items she lists are , in fact , in the DVD ( at least # 4-9 are , and I 'm tempted to rewatch the disc again to check out # 1-3 ) .Indeed , it 's a fine , rich recreation of the film , itself marred only by jarring differences in sound between dialog and music , and some rather clumsy adaptation from stage to screen.The cast ( save , perhaps , the soporific Ken Howard ) is magnificent , the music wonderful , and the glimpse into American history well worth the price of admission .	1
I really like this movie ... actually it 's a musical set to the screen . And the music is wonderful ! All of the country 's founding fathers are here , especially Adams , Franklin and Jefferson . Washington is also there but only in his words , in the letters he sends to the congress in Philadelphia . Some interesting political commentary , if you will , by others who would have remained loyal to King George , but most are portrayed as vigorously engaged in overthrowing colonial rule in favor of independence . Probably the two most interesting portions of the film involve personal relationships . The first is John Adams ' loving relationship with his wife ( as revealed in the letters they send to each other ) . And the second is the relationship that grows between Jefferson , Adams and Franklin . There are serious moments , for example the discussion over slavery , and funny moments with Franklin 's observations of his colleagues in congress . The movie does tend to run a bit long , so some of you might get a little restless after a while . But this is still the wonderful , historic ( with a great deal of license ) musical/movie that is best watched on the Fourth of July .	1
Richard Nixon reportedly nixed the Cool Conservative Men number . Paranoid Dick . This version supplies the parts that made the theater version so bad and puzzling . It 's like reading ALL of the story . It 's a huge improvement .	1
I had to watch this movie for the first time for a highschool summmer reading program and I loved it immediatly . Its a movie every american should see at least once . I usually dont like musicals but this one is truely great . The characters are unforgetable and you will find yourself singing the songs in the shower . An accurate portrain of the Declaration of Independance of the United States . A great movie to own . I ca n't wait until this comes out on DVD .	1
Wow ! Toe taping at times and always passionate .A great depiction of the strength of character and weaknesses of the men involved in creating the greatest document out side of the Bible . This will educate as well as entertain you and your children . The sets and costumes and the portrayal of the arguments for and against independence grips the eye , your ears and your mind . You wonder that these remarkable men could exist in such a place and time . You will not regret the time you spend watching this strong patriotic film . First saw this film while serving in Northern Thailand in 1974 . Since then all my brothers and my children , both grown and younger love this film and you will too .	1
The original musical was responsible for unearthing several facts about the way American indepedence was brought about , esecially the underappreciated role that John Adams played in it . The play was responsible for a renewed interest in the Revolutionary era , and the movie played more than a small role as a precursor to America 's Bicentennial celebration.With this DVD restoration ( and it is a restoration in more than one sense , not just a remastering ) , the film is presented the way the creators intended it to be , which is vastly different from the way Warner Bros. released it back in 1972 . When I watched the DVD for the first time ( after seeing the original on commercial TV for years ) , I almost did n't recognize it . There are several scenes edited back into the movie rather than added to a & quot ; special features & quot ; section like most movies . This is a rare instance where doing so is justified and right , since the studio mercilessly and ignorantly cut the film down before release.The fact that the movie is so radically restored makes up for the lack of significant extras , although the commentary by the writer and director are interesting , and the audition reels are amusing , especially when you consider the fact that the cast is virtually a complete transfer from the Broadway production . This is a must DVD for collectors , even if they are n't huge fans of the movie , because of the incredible work done to restore the film to its intended form .	1
A fun way to view history ( even though there remains slight artistic license but not enough to detract from the crux of history or the film 's sheer entertainment value ) .	1
One of the best & quot ; Broadway to Hollywood & quot ; transfers , terribly underated during its original release . It seems impossible , but everything works in this enjoyable musical concerning the events surrounding the writing and signing of the Declaration of Independance.Great ensemble performances . Even the somewhat silly songs ring true . However , the version to see is director Peter Hunt 's original preview cut which runs almost 40 minutes longer than the currently available pan/scan mono tape . It restores the great COOL COOL CONSERVATIVE MEN sequence along with several other scenes . COME ON COLUMBIA HOME VIDEO , GIVE US THE & quot ; TRUE & quot ; 1776 ! ! ! That is the version which rates 10 stars in my opinion ! ! !	1
I have my wife to thank for this . Always enjoyed the movie but had heard several scenes were taken out . Well they 're back in this director 's cut . Only makes the movie better .	1
My godson was absent for this movie in school and saw it here . It was okay he said but I loved it . Brought back U.S History facts that to this day are important to know , and all in a fun way to watch . In the end he got to answer hs homework questions and get a good grade ^_^	1
I love this movie ! The story line , the actors , the music are all excellent ! This movie/play was created during the time when the Vietnam War was slowly coming toward an end.The songs compliment the political atmosphere in that era , and they certainly fit in today with what has been going on in D.C. for the past eight years . Yes , I 'm including both Congress and the White House , `` Piddle , twiddle , and resolve , not one thing is ever solved '' fits what has been going on with Democrats and Republicans to a 'T'.Speaking of `` Piddle , twiddle , and resolve '' the only disappointment I have with this DVD is that the diector did n't include the full version of the song . You can find the full version on the CD of `` 1776 '' but not on this DVD.Other than that , excellent movie !	1
Every 4th of July I watch `` 1776 , '' the musical that has our Founding Fathers singing and dancing their way to Independency , and every time John and Abagail Adams sing goodbye to each other ( `` Till Then '' and `` Yours , Yours , Yours '' ) , I get choked up . William Daniels has his role of a lifetime as John Adams , the obnoxious and disliked Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress who is the most fervent advocate of independence ( `` Piddle , Twiddle and Resolve '' ) . Virginia Vestoff plays his wife Abigail , and their exchanges are based on the `` Dearest Friend '' correspondences they wrote to each other during the crucial summer of 1776 . However , the most unforgettable performance in `` 1776 '' comes from Howard Da Silva as Dr. Benjamin Franklin . The actor , who played movie villains for years , manages to convey not only Franklin 's wit but also his firm belief in the new race of `` Americans . '' Ken Howard plays Thomas Jefferson and joins with Adams and Franklin in the show 's two cutest numbers , `` But , Mr. Adams '' and `` The Egg . '' I have never cottoned `` The Lees of Old Virginia , '' the song sung by Richard Henry Lee ( Ron Holgate ) and where every lyric line ends with `` LY , '' but at the other end of the spectrum is the chilling `` Molasses to Rum to Slaves , '' the song about the Triangle Trade sung by South Carolina 's Edward Rutledge ( John Cullum ) . The ensemble cast brings the Second Continental Congress alive , with Roy Poole as Stephen Hopkins , David Ford as John Hancock and William Hansen as Caesar Rodney standing out . Most of the cast members were in the Tony Award winning original Broadway cast , although Blythe Danner replaces Betty Buckley as Martha Jefferson ( `` He Plays the Violin '' ) .Peter Stone 's book is remarkably accurate in relating the historical events ; the biggest error a historian would point to is that John Dickinson ( Donald Madden ) , did not show up the day of the crucial vote so that Pennsylvania would not kill Independence . But Broadway and Hollywood must be allowed to make things more dramatic . What makes `` 1776 '' so wonderful is how it teaches history while being so entertaining . The opening of the film , where the tirade by Mr. Adams against the do nothing Continental Congress is interrupted by the collective Founding Fathers jumping up and singing `` Sit Down , John , '' sets the tone and Peter H. Hunt 's film delivers throughout . The show 's best moment comes in `` Is Anybody There ? '' when John Adams , all alone in the quiet chamber , dreams of the pomp and pageantry of a free America.I also have the laserdisc version , which runs 176 minutes and includes 35 minutes of material originally cut from the film , including the song `` Cool , Considerate Men '' and alternative shots in several sequences . While the quality of the additional material is in very sad shape , fans of `` 1776 '' will take what they can get . Hopefully the complete film can be restored before we get to the DVD version ( hint , hint , hint ) . Granted , the idea of a musical about the Declaration of Independence seems bizarre ; I once blew off a chance to see `` 1776 '' on stage because I thought the idea was stupid . But this is a first-rate musical that makes the time and issues come alive , so that even thought we obviously know the outcome , we are enthralled because it looks like Mr. Adams will never get his Declaration adopted . If you are looking for a film to watch each 4th of July , `` 1776 '' is the one .	1
I find that this is one of the greatest moments in American history-The actors are so real that you feel as though you were actually there.I really love the actors & the people that they portray-especially William Daniels as John Adams , Howard DaSilva as Ben Franklin & Ken Howard as Thomas Jefferson.A truly great movie ! ! !	1
I love this musical . It 's my fave - I never saw the Broadway original , but knew people that did - they were raptureous about it . And I thought , why has it never gotten iconic status , with NYers telling me it 's the best musical they 've ever seen ? I did see an excellent version later on at a very good theatre , and was stunned at how good it was . So I bought the movie , and loved it . Yes , I joined the club , especially being a Revolutionary War history buff . Ok , some of the history is not so sharp , but it 's still fun . It certainly seems to capture some of the character of Adams and Franklin.I also have a thing about movies being edited . So often plot is sacrificed for time , leaving the movie disjointed and me thinking , `` But I do n't understand this part ... '' So when I had a chance to see the unedited version , I was thrilled . Ha ! Guess what ? It was left out for a reason . A . The movie is really , really long . B . The song is not good and C. The most damning of all , it takes a historical movie and puts a modern political view in it , mainly that the founding fathers were leftists ! Aha ! Those evil conservatives ! Tories ! All they want is money ! Those evil businessmen are all leftists ... Wait ... Huh ? Now some of them were leftist no doubt ( Certain views of Thomas Paine come to mind ) but people that were fighting for less government control and taxes , and formed a government that was a representative Republic - well , it can be argued they were what today is considered conservative . So `` To the right , ever to the right , Never to the left , forever to the right , We have gold , a market that will hold , Tradition that is old , a reluctance to be bold ... '' being sung by the Tories is where the movie takes a hard lurch for me into modern leftist Hollywood politics . It certainly tries to put a modern political spin on 1776 , and it does n't belong there.So glad they left it out . I 'm sure some would disagree with me , but I mean , leave the partisan lectures out of this one , especially when they are inaccurate , so I can enjoy the movie . Thanks .	1
I remember seeing this musical as a kid and loved it ... this movie version is a wonderful recreation of that experience . The casting is superb ( no one else but William Daniels can be John Adams ! ) , the directing , choreography and editing is top notch . I watch this movie at least once a year on July 4th , but sometimes watch parts of it throughout the year . I know some people complain about a couple of musical numbers being shortened , but it 's minor and does n't detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie . It 's a very entertaining way to get an idea of what was going on back in 1776 ... how difficult it was for our founding fathers to get this nation off the ground ... but they never gave up . It 's an extremely inspirational story , that 's served up with zest , humor , and great musical numbers.Best lines are at the beginning , John Adams : `` I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace ... that two are called a law firm ... and that three or more become a Congress ! '' Boy is that timeless , or what ? !	1
The top-notch score and book for Broadway 's `` 1776 '' have been unjustly forgotten over the years ( to put it another way , how many times does Broadway have to revive `` Oklahoma '' before putting a new production of this on its feet ) , and the film lovingly recreates the musical with deft , striking cinematic touches . Most of the Broadway cast has been retained , particularly William Daniels , Ken Howard and Howard Da Silva , all of whom are brilliant as John Adams , Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin , respectively . Among the new-to-the-movie performances , Blythe Danner is an absolute delight as Martha Jefferson and John Cullum 's rendition of `` Molasses to Rum to Slaves , '' which hammers the hypocrisy of the Northern colonial abolitionists who still profited from the slave trade is staggering . Truth is , there is n't a bad performance , singing or acting , in this entire film . The sets of 18th century Philadelphia are wonderfully evocative and the lighting and camera work , particularly some brilliantly s-l-o-o-o-o-w-w-w-w lap dissolves , are terrific . Probably in any other year , this film would have been well represented at the Oscars ( but it came out against `` The Godfather '' ) . What makes the DVD so special is not just the pristine look of the film , but the restoration of several scenes , long and short , which had never before been seen , including one entire number ( `` Cool Conservative Men '' ) which gave Richard Nixon , then president , fits . Watch it , particularly the choreography , and you 'll know why . Even better is the very incisive and informative commentary track , which actually gives insight into the production . Whether you 're a history buff or just a movie buff , you should own this film .	1
My family watches 1776 every year around the 4th of July . This movie has great music , fantastic acting and uses as much historically correct dialogue and lyrics as possible . I have read thousands of pages of Revolutionary War era biographies and I am still discovering phrases used in the movie both in dialogue and lyrics that are factual : from letters , pamphlets , and other sources . Each time technology produces a new vehicle for the consumer to view movies at home I will buy this movie in that form . So far I 've bought it from tape to dvd . The dvd has commentaries which are very entertaining . This is the movie that sparked my interest in American History . This movie has never been remade as far as I know and that MUST be because it was so well cast and so well acted that any remake would only motivate people to rent the original . A remake could never ever be this good . It is wonderful . A classic .	1
I discovered this movie as a child when it aired on TV during the Bicentennial . I did n't know what I was missing until I had seen ( and later directed ) the stage version of the show . Not only was there additional dialogue that was missing , but also that wonderful song `` Cool , Considerate Men '' that I had heard on my LP of the Broadway soundtrack was nowhere to be found ! This Director 's cut restores EVERYTHING , so that it more closely resembles its Broadway version than any other stage musical that I 've ever seen brought to the screen . And William Daniels will ALWAYS be THE DEFINITIVE John Adams !	1
Even though I gave this as a gift , I have seen it before and I love it ! - it 's amazing to me that a musical can be made on any subject in the world ! - this is a great movie to watch on the Fourth of July ! - it made me appreciate what our founding fathers did for us !	1
This seemingly innocent musical has more truth in in than fiction . The music and the non political interplay of course is fiction . But the speeches and debates among the delegate regarding the Declaration are taken from historical records .	1
I 'm not a movie person , but this is one film I can watch over and over . As others have noted , the casting is outstanding , particularly William Daniels as John Adams and Howard Da Silva as Ben Franklin . But even among the `` minor '' characters , I can not think of a clunker in the bunch.I 'm also not a Broadway person , but this musical is far above the average ho-hum lyrics and boring , tuneless `` music . '' It 's not Beethoven , but the songs are snappy and funny and easy on the ears . The very best moment in the film breaks that mold , however -- John Cullum ( a.k.a . Mark Green 's dad on `` E.R . '' ) is stupendous on the dark , intense `` Molasses to Rum . '' I was 10 when the movie came out , so I could not have put it in words then , but forever after I have been mesmerized by how charged Cullum 's performance is . An extra plus is that the widescreen format brings the context back to a lot of the songs as you see the characters interact with each other and framed properly in the shots.People of all ages will enjoy this film because it brings the personalities to life . The dialog includes actual quotes from the real characters , and you get to experience the Founding Fathers as real people , not just pictures in a book . Plus it gets you gripped in the underlying drama . I mean , I 'm 44 years old now and every time I watch the movie I still get nervous about whether the Declaration will make it through ! It may not be heavyweight history , but it might just get you hooked enough to check out the real thing . Good God , man , buy it ! It 's worth the money !	1
Script by Univ of Penn history professor is reported to be the most accurate portrayal of our founding fathers , based on historical documents . The musical compositions are wide-ranging , capturing the gamut of emotions one would expect of those times . The most haunting song is & # 34 ; Momma , Look Sharp & # 34 ; , sung with very effective lighting by a young militia Soldier . The most disturbing song is & # 34 ; Molasses to Rum to Slaves & # 34 ; , sung by a delegate from South Carolina , touching on teh various emotions and perspectives of slavery . The most evocative songs are the duets between John Adams and Abigail , with text taken from their actual letters to one another . There 's much humor found in Ben Franklin 's portrayal by Henry DaSilva , and in Richard Henry Lee 's song about getting the Virginia legislature to pen a declaration for independency . I watch this musical every 4th of July .	1
This is simply a magnificent production that is a must see for any red-blooded American . You are presented with a 50-yard-line ticket to the difficult politics surrounding the creation of the Declaration of Independence . Adams , Franklin , and Jefferson - with help from Washington by letter - cajole and browbeat the other representatives of the 13 colonies into cohesion , using some of the exact words taken from historical writings . BF - `` We must now hang together or we most assuredly will hang separately . `` I signed up for this play ( 1776 ) , complete with period costumes , in a community theatre some years ago - because they needed voices for the men 's chorus - and was given the minor part of George Read , delegate from Delaware . Inspired by the nightly rehearsal history lessons , I began reading about these men who almost did n't make it happen . The more I read , the more I was impressed by this significant , yet hilarious musical production.The cast is great , the script is superb , the music supplements the dialogue seamlessly , the character portrayals of JA , BF , and TJ are compelling and historically accurate , the foreshadowing of future problems with slavery are laid bare , compromises necessary for agreement are exposed - leading to the final scene of the dramatic signing of the Declaration of Independence . This is a masterpiece worthy of your time next July 4th - Get the DVD edition .	1
I saw this movie more than 25 years ago as part of a junior high history class ( and , naturally , had quickly forgotten it ) , but had the pleasant experience of seeing a touring Broadway version of it last year . Wow ! What an amazing show it was - I doubt there was anyone in the crowd who was not teary-eyed at the end , during the emotional scene where each state/delegate bravely signs the document , risking his life and property , and forever changes the world in ways he could not even imagine.I quickly went out and bought the CD of the wonderful music , but hesitated to buy the film version as I was hoping it would come out on DVD . Voila ! Here it is ( perhaps thanks to Amazon 's great feature of allowing you to `` vote '' for an item 's release ) . I was first in the Amazon checkout line , and was not at all disappointed.William Daniels is superb as John Adams . I was used to hearing Brent Spiner ( Star Trek 's Commander Data ! ) sing this role from my CD of the revival cast , and to my amazement , he did a fantastic job as well . But it 's hard not to think of the kind , gentle Data when listening to him ( at least to Trek fans ! ) , which is kind of distracting . While Daniels seemed familiar to me somehow ( and now I know why - Knight Rider and St . Elsewhere ) , and while he does n't seem to physically resemble Adams too well , I thought he was quite believable as Adams , and that Howard DaSilva was even more so as Franklin.As for the DVD , it was nice to see some extras , especially the restored scenes ( who cares what Nixon thought ! ) and the ( sometimes lame ) commentary . The widescreen angle , I think , makes all the difference given the historical significance of the room where most of the action takes place - it is nice to see the WHOLE room , especially during the very moving scene when the document is read for the first time . `` We hold these truths to be self-evident ... '' My complaints with the DVD are few . The sound , occasionally , seems to be uneven , and even monaural at times , but this may be a result of the once-deleted scenes that were pieced back in . I do appreciate the conversion to Dolby 5.1 , and the few sound lapses are worth it to get the Dolby audio.Also , the screen tests were mostly of the lesser cast , and not much different from the actual scenes in the movie . Kinda worthless filler.I was a little disappointed with the emotional impact of the final scene , which I thought was done much better in the Broadway version I saw . Each signer stood around the desk after signing , in a pose that was plucked right out of John Trumbull 's famous painting of the event , at which point a huge , see-through backlit silk backdrop of the Declaration was lowered in front of the frozen-in-place signers , with them visible behind it as the Liberty Bell rang triumphantly . It sent chills right up my back , and was a sure catalyst for a standing ovation . While I can appreciate how this was probably hard to recreate on screen , and while it is done to some degree , it just did n't seem as effective to me.Minor complaints aside , this is a fantastic movie . It gives you an awe-struck appreciation for the incredible events that led to the founding of this nation , and makes you marvel at the fact that it ever happened at all . So many things could have - and did - go wrong , from Washington 's dismal dispatches about the sorry state of his troops to the entire Southern delegation walking out of Congress over the slave issue . It makes one line in the Declaration , added afterwards , especially prophetic - `` with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence ... ... '' Highly recommended to all .	1
I 'm one for collecting movies with a Holiday theme , regardless of the holiday . Look at all the Christmas classics that have come out on DVD over the last few years , and I am waiting patiently for EASTER PARADE for that holiday . By accident , I discovered this great film , which is one of my favorite musicals , was getting the DVD treatment . After exploring more today ( a week from release ) , I am `` FLOORED '' that it will be the director 's cut , as I have only seen the VHS and TV-broadcast edited version . I was never fortunate to see the Laser Disc with the extra footage . Prior to it 's recent Broadway revival closing , I took in 1776 with the current cast and thouroughly enjoyed it , and witnessed for the first time the song that was cut from the film . I am waiting anxiously now until next Tuesday so I can finally see this masterpiece in its full form for the first time . The cast is splendid , and I agree with another reviewer here that if Ben Franklin is not Howard DaSilva 's portrayal when we reach the pearly gates , we will be disappointed . One of the few film versions of a musical that retains most of the original cast , William Daniels as John Adams is superb , as is Mr. DaSilva , Ken Howard , John Cullum , et al . For the ladies , Blythe Danner is time-period gorgeous as Mrs. Thomas Jefferson , and Virginia Vestoff as Abigail Adams has a glorious voice . I do n't know what happened to her , but she should have been a standards concert star in the realm of Garland and Streisand . I 've seen this film every July 4 for years , and now will have it on DVD . You should too !	1
Have enjoyed since first viewing many years ago . One of the early movies in & # 34 ; surround & # 34 ; . A western fan all my life .	1
Very entertaining . It has a lot of different things . I love horse . Horse play a good role in it , I mean there are many horse action in it .	1
EVER SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE STANDARD DVD I HAD BEFORE ... BLU-RAY QUALITY IS SO MAGNIFICENT -- BETTER THAN REAL LIFE..ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITE MOVIES EVER ... WELL WORTH THE PRICE	1
Absoloutely one of my favorite movies ! Excellent PQ & AQ . Kevin Kline , Scott Glenn , Linda Hunt as well as all the rest of the cast ( Brian Dennehy , Jeff Goldblum , Danny Glover , Kevin Costner , et al ) present superb nuanced performances . Heartily recommended !	1
OK , so is this a great movie , or what ? I know , it is full of chiches , burdened by a couple of bad performances ( you know who they are ) and includes certain characters ( Jeff Goldbloom 's gambler , for example ) for reasons that only Lawrence Kasdin may understand . But for all that , it resonates with an excitement few movies do . The cast is exceptional : Kevin Klin , Bryan Dennehy , Linda Hunt , Scott Glen , John Clesse , Danny Glover and Kevin Costner ( alright , maybe we do n't want , to brag about Kevin ) . The Kasdin script is exceptional , and gives full play to each actor 's talents . The scene between Kostner and Hunt in the bar where they discuss their mutual love of a good & quot ; smoky saloon & quot ; is a great scene , as are the ones with John Clesse as a sheriff reluctanly enforcing his authority . Dennehy makes a wonderfully likeable villian and Scott Glenn is a great foil for Padin , the Kevin Kline character . Every Western gimmic and convention imaginable is employed in this film , which is a bit too long because of that , but great fun nevertheless . No one can view this movie and not come away with quotable lines and memorable scenes . It 's a great tribute to the American Western and a real entertainment in its own right .	1
This movie arrived on time and in very good condition . I would recommend the purchase of this movie to anyone who likes another Good Sunday , or Saturday afternoon to just sit and watch the entire Movie .	1
great film one of the classic westerns would reccommend for any one 's library of western films or horses and cowboys	1
SilveradoMy hubby ask for this and was surprised to have it at Christmas . It is one of his favorite movies .	1
This was a great Western . Very creative and adventerous , and a wonderful cast . Where else would you see a Monty Python alum as a sheriff in a Western ? This movie featured three of my favorite actors : Scott Glenn , Brian Dennehy , and Jeff Goldblum . It also featured one of my favorite actresses , Rosanna Arquette , though she had such a small role even the worst actress could n't mess that role up . Kevin Costner had a youthful exhuberance that I had n't seen since from him . And I 'm just mentioning my favorites.I 'll stop before I spoil any surprises . If you want a classic western , this is one .	1
Arrived on time . Plays without problems . This is a classic western with timeless themes of friendships weathering hard times , betrayal , and bad guys that need to be beaten down . Love it .	1
Both charismatic ensemble performances and swift pacing make this film rousing entertainment . It 's fairly light fare as westerns go , but the players are having such fun , the audience just has to get in on it . Feast your eyes on this cast : Jeff Goldblum , Linda Hunt , Brian Dennehy , Rosanna Arquette , Scott Glenn and a young , energetic Kevin Costner . How can you lose ?	1
For a description of the plot , etc. , read other reviews . Just some thoughts on this movie ... In a nutshell , Silverado ( 1985 ) is one of the better Westerns ever made . Filmed in New Mexico , this movie has it all - a good plot , humor , action , romance , and great New Mexico scenery . The cast includes Kevin Costner , Kevin Kline , Jeff Goldblum , Danny Glover , Linda Hunt , Brian Dennehy , Scott Glenn , and John Cleese . The acting is solid . The musical score is OK to pretty good , sort of a throwback to the classic Westerns of decades earlier . The acting is good . The action scenes are very well done . This is a classic shoot 'em up Western . Some people might lump Westerns into the `` If you 've seen one , you 've seen them all '' category , but I find that Westerns are not all the same . Westerns have been filmed all over the West , everywhere from New Mexico to Texas to Oregon to Wyoming , etc . The plots vary . Sure , they all have gunfights , barroom brawls inside saloons , card playing , duels , etc. , but that comes with the territory.Overall , this is a good movie that I recommmend .	1
I 've had this movie for about 5 years and ca n't remember how many times I 've watched it . The cast is superlative..everyone of them is completely believable . The sets are outstanding and the vista 's are really worth staring at . This is one of Kevin Costner 's best performance 's , right up there with Dances with Wolves . Danny Glover , who is one of my favorite actors , gives a fine performance . Scott Glenn , Kevin Kline , Linda Hunt , and Brian Dennehy all turned in outstanding performance 's . I think the casting director should have gotten an oscar for putting this cast together.Highly recommend this film ... even if you ar n't a fan of westerns this one will entertain you .	1
Having seen this film on VHS years ago , I decided to order the DVD . The quality is better than pretty good , and the story is a western in true grand style . The good guys are honorable and strong and able to conquer evil-doers by brute force . They have physical courage and a sense of moral outrage at evil-doing . The bad guys are just the was old westerns wrote them -- having no redeeming qualities . Every actor playing a main character ( good or bad ) has gone on to have a fine career in acting . It was fun seeing them in an earlier ( 1980 's ) work .	1
Silverado is one of my all time favorite westerns , I just really like this movie and always recommend it whenever someone asks what my favorite westerns are .	1
Lawrence Kasdan 's epic tale of the west features four larger than life heroes in the form of Kevin Kline , Danny Glover , Scott Glen and - in one of his first roles - Kevin Costner . An all round success .	1
Silverado is not only a top notch western featuring a very A list cast , but it is important as it was the first `` A '' western made in Hollywood in years . ( By A I mean not made for TV . ) The cast list is a who 's who of great actors from Glenn , Glover , Costner , Kline , etc ... as the Paths of Glenn returning home from Jail , Kline a reformed thief and Glover who comes out west to aid his father converge . There is some first rate comedy and action . John Cleese as the Sheriff is played straight but works as comedy as well.There is nothing to dislike about this film , it is a fine tribute to all the fine westerns that came before it.Look for a small cameo at the begining by Sheb Wooley a longtime western actor from the 50 's and 60 's . If they could have squeezed in Jack Elam somehow it would have been perfect .	1
great structure , really liked how the screenwriter showed why the leads were likable and interesting ; the story itself provided situations for the characters 's essential natures to be displayed , which is so unusual in most films . it basically let 's the audience into the story . love that . do n't often get to see african american ranchers facing racism in film , and overall , just liked how believably the story presented conflict as a cover for resource wars . all the acting was good , but my favorite part was the writing : every lead character held their weight in terms of being interesting , appealing and believable . 3 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 4 .	1
I would love to give all of these sets the 5 star Blu review , but when enough little things creep in there I try to remain objective and rate it comparatively against other excellent releases . The movie played great and the overall product makes for an appealing gift idea , but the initial release price kills it.The picture quality has the upgraded feel over the prior releases ( excluding the Superbit ) and provides for a fun watch with little to no grain or flicker . There is a buffered/fuzzy look in some sequences where there is a great deal of light contrasting dark clothing ( several of the shots where cast members are outlined by a bright sky ) . To get an idea of the before/after watch the documentary making of opening sequence/Silverado title vs. the BD opening , you will see the amount of clarity upgrades . What disappointed me was the conversion backwards on the sound , meaning they chose not to take the DTS soundtrack from theSilverado ( 2 Disc Superbit Gift Set ) release . I love the DTS , and as usual with the THD there is a flatter feel . Not a deal breaker , just not the best.The supplements are a copy from the Superbit release including the Historian 's Commentary , the Making Of , and the Return with Costner ( which gets old fast - playing the interview in the store had customers disliking his `` I am Silverado '' attitude ) . The BD does have the new MovieIQ option ( your player needs to be BD Live enabled ) that when turned on is like having an updated IMDB on your screen for everything there is about the cast , crew , etc . The book is inconsequential and really only had one page ( will include a scan once it streets - no prebook pics are allowed ) of the 34 that entertained me . The majority of the pages are fuzzy glossy pics of the main cast and their bios . The audio has Spanish , French and Portuguese 5.1 tracks with subs in the same . A/B/C coded and states the `` approx . 132 minutes '' as opposed to the 133 on the Superbit.Wish I could say run out and buy it right away , but I feel the prior special edition owners will be rightfully wary . I love playing it in the store as the clarity makes for a good presentation , but I have several people waiting for a price drop . Enjoy ...	1
I love this movie . At the end of the day , what matters is that you are true to yourself . Jude Law is amazing as Lord Alfred Douglas ( Bosie ) , so is Stephen Fry as Oscar Wilde . This is highly recommended .	1
Great performance and direction . Very fair treatment of Oscar Wilde during a period of social upheavel unrecognizable in informed cultures .	1
Though I find Oscar Wilde as intriguing as anyone else would , I am not a scholar of either his works or his life . I watched the movie primarily as a fan of Stephen Fry . I really enjoyed his portrayal of Wilde ; he plays Wilde with most of the very characteristics that Fry himself ( publicly , anyway ) possesses : warmth , sympathy , generosity and a little vulnerability . That said , I began to wonder just how accurate that portrayal really is . I 've read enough about Wilde to get the impression that he was brilliantly dry , witty , droll and sarcastic . But I saw barely any of that on the screen . I can understand that he would n't show his `` dinner party face '' with his family or children , but neither can I see him being as awkward and embarrassed as he appears to be in the scene with Alfred Taylor 's rent-boys . So I 'm left wondering who the `` real '' Oscar Wilde really was . Most people , no doubt , certainly would know better than I do . I certainly liked Oscar Wilde 's personality in this film , anyway . Jude Law plays `` Bosie '' wonderfully , regardless of how accurate his portrayal might be ( again , I do n't know enough about him to know whether it is . ) He is sweet and tender in one scene , and hateful and narcissistic in the next and both are very believable . He also bares as striking resemblance to the real Bosie as Fry does to Wilde ( though both are really better looking than their characters . ) I concur with other reviewers that not enough emphasis is placed upon Wilde 's work and the creation process , other than perhaps the story he wrote for his boys . I came away knowing little more than I started with , which is virtually nil . However , I disagree with others that the sex is over-emphasized or excessive or graphic . I did n't come away thinking it was any more graphic/excessive than any other R-rated film would be ; if anything , a good deal less . I did n't , however , learn how Wilde came to realize that he was bisexual/homosexual . One minute he 's looking wistfully at an attractive younger man , the next , he 's in bed with an attractive younger man ( not necessarily the same younger man . ) Perhaps IRL Wilde _didn't_ experience any inner conflict or struggle with his sexual identity , but I would still like to have seen more of the realization process . Still , this is a wonderful film that I would recommend to anyone interested in either Oscar Wilde or Stephen Fry , as well as Jude Law and Michael Sheen .	1
Whether you know absolutely nothing about Oscar Wilde , or if you 've been a fan for ages , you will love this movie . Fry is an incredible Oscar , and Law a terrifically vicious Bosie . The story of Oscar 's love for a spoiled brat , and his inevitable downfall is fabulously framed by Wilde 's own fairy tale of & quot ; The Selfish Giant. & quot ; It 's truly a wonderful film , and I ca n't wait for the price to go down to a reasonable amount so I can finally own it !	1
For the most part , this is one of the most amazingly accurate biopics I have ever seen . The screenwriter obviously wrote it with Richard Ellman 's stellar biography in one hand , and except for one small bit , stays astonishingly true to the facts of Wilde 's life . The accuracy is one of the two things that makes this film so fascinating . The other is the remarkable performances by the films actors . Stephen Fry is nothing short of remarkable , acting Wilde as a real person , instead of a parody or caricature of Wilde . Jude Law , in one of his first notable screen performances , is appropriately fetching as Alfred Lord Douglas ( and I do admire his courage as a heterosexual actor portraying so convincingly a homosexual siren ) . Tom Wilkinson , who each year seems to distinguish himself more and more as one of the most versatile and talented actors in film , is suitably vicious and tenacious as Lord Douglas 's father , the Marquess of Queensbury . He strikes perfectly the pose of evangelical fervor and philistinism that one detects in reading of the real Marquess . Jennifer Ehle is excellent in the thankless role of Wilde 's wife . The movie depicts quite accurately Wilde 's intention in prison to return to his wife after leaving prison , an intention that was frustrated by her death before his release . His relationship with Robbie Ross , who was in real life probably Wilde 's most faithful and dedicated friend , is shown in moving detail.The lone complaint I have with the film is the omission of the past couple of years of Wilde 's life . Although he was reunited with Alfred Lord Douglas briefly upon his release from prison , their attempted reconciliation was largely a failure , and they eventually went their own ways , with Lord Douglas completely turning his back on Wilde during his time of greatest need . The end of Wilde 's life was heartbreakingly tragic , with Wilde often employing his considerable conversational skills in entertaining strangers for the cost of a few drinks . The contrast between the Oscar Wilde who had multiple plays running simultaneously in London in the 1890s and the Wilde who died nearly friendless and penniless in France in 1900 is as poignant as any in literary history . In 1895 , he is the toast of London ; in 1900 , a pariah . But perhaps this alternative version of Wilde 's life would have been too bleak . Even without the fuller ending , this is a very sad and tragic film . And WILDE proves that you can have a biopic that can , at the same time , maintain an exceedingly high degree of historical advocacy while remaining dramatically engrossing .	1
This was truly a beautiful and exquisite film about the clever and witty Oscar Wilde , whom i believe was truly the Shakespeare of his time . Of course this film does n't bring complete justice to the man himself , but who cares , this film does enough to portray a man who was the icon of an English society that loved him , and one that denounced him for the rest of his life . Everything from the setting of London , the dialect , the clothing , the characterization , acting , etc . were exquisite and truly convincing to its time and its era . The glamour of it all did n't digress from the story . At times i got emotional because i for one am an admirer of Oscar Wilde as the artist and poet . He was a man of wit and of intelligence , mixed together his prose and personality became that of controversy because it was misunderstood and interpreted as `` immoral '' . And Jude Law did an excellent job playing as Bosie , and everyone else in the cast did wonderfully as well . This is truly a masterpiece for those who want to know more about the man that created the biggest scandal in literary history based on his personality and personal desires alone . Truly touching , wonderful , and heartbreaking to the end .	1
Everything about this movie is utterly impeccable . The story ( based on Richard Ellmann 's biography of Wilde ) is as historically accurate as it is entertaining . The acting is perfectly incredible , with wonderful performances by Stephen Fry as the tremendous but simultaneously tragic Oscar Wilde , and Jude Law as his complex young lover Lord Alfred `` Boise '' Douglas . This movie is an absolute must for any fan of Oscar Wilde , or anyone with an open mind who enjoys learning about extraordinary people . Please do not let some of the homosexual themes in this movie intimidate you away from watching this movie . I will admit that at first I was a little uneasy about watching a movie with homosexual love affairs in it , but when I watched this movie I felt like they were absolutely not overdone but historically correct and they fit perfectly into this exceptional movie about the wonderful Oscar Wilde . I strongly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who is mature and open-minded enough to see it . I think you will fall in love with this amazing story about the compelling wit , charm , and life of Oscar Wilde .	1
a popular story of the history of the French Revolution and its amazing conclusion in spite of the French governments best efforts	1
Each version of Les Miserables have slight differences . This one also has a very nice ending . I would recommend this movie .	1
EXCELLENT MOVIETHIS TITLE IS NOW AVAILABLE ON BLU-RAY FORMAT , AT : amazon.es ( amazon spain ) with English subtitleI HAVE WAITED MANY YEARS TO PURCHASE THIS TITLE ON BLU-RAY FORMAT	1
ive been looking for this movie for a long time and i found it at amizon no problem and at a great price and there always arrive on time or before	1
Liam Neeson is awesome in this movie . this is one of my favorite movies . Geoffrey Rush is also excellent . Just recently saw the new release in the theater and this one is the better one , although the new one including music is a marvel as well .	1
This is a heart wrenching story about the struggles of the poor in a world where there was hardly a & # 34 ; middle class & # 34 ; ... .. only rich or poor with male dominance . The beginning of the French Revolution is rather a & # 34 ; side story & # 34 ; with the main theme throughout being the cinderella-like love story !	1
I have enjoyed all the film versions of this classic book ; I LOVE this version because of the perfect cast and acting and the outstanding music . Even though this adaptation fast-forwards through some parts of the story , it captures the message about the triumph of Grace and Compassion over the merciless , unyielding , and cruel , disguised as law and/or righteousness.4 stars instead of 5 stars due to the wide screen black bars are too thick . Nearly 50 percent of the picture is taken up by the black bars above and below . I much prefer when they format it a bit ; even if it means to lose a little of the scenes .	1
Amybe not so popular among younger people , which is why it slipped through the cracks and was soon forgotten , but this film is an absolute wonder by all means . Delivering powerful performances by a talented cast , and beautious scenery , this film depicts the life of a convict who is transformed by a single act of kindness , with a detective on his tail for over twenty years . Not exactly like the book , but that does n't make it worse . It 's a winner , and if you 're a fan of the movies Elizabeth and Braveheart , then rent this one tonight ! The DVD release is wonderfully mastered , with a widescreen format to truly enjoy the intended images , two Dolby soundtracks that give high-guality sound , and a theatrical trailer . Give this one a chance ; you wo n't be sorry .	1
Firstly , allow me to write that I have never read Victor Hugo 's masterpiece `` Les Miserables . '' Therefore , I can not judge the quality of this film adaptation against the novel , although I do know the basic plot of the novel . ( There is some mischaracterization in this production , as there likely will be in any 130 minute film based upon a very long novel . ) However , I did find the film adaptation relatively interesting . For the most part , the acting was good . I believe the main element of plot ( i.e . the revenge story ) was covered adequately.I would personally recommend the French `` Les Miserables '' miniseries staring Gerald Depardieu ( who also plays in another French-language miniseries entitled `` Le Compte of Monte Cristo '' ) . Although it is not perfect , it is better than any other adaptation of which I am currently aware . [ However , my knowledge of French films based on classic novels is far less than my knowledge of British or American films based on classic novels of British or American literature . ] As of December 2009 , the French `` Les Miserables '' miniseries is NOT available in the U.S. DVD market ( i.e . the Region 1 market ) . ( However , one could purchase the film from Amazon.fr , especially if one has an international account and a Region 2 DVD player . ) I will provide the link to the amazon.fr `` Les Miserables '' page under `` Comments . ''	1
EXCELLENT version of the movie , Liam makes the movie believable and thrilling . Spoken , not sung throughout the movie it is easier to understand and gives way more details to the musical version .	1
From poverty to becoming wealthy ; and still maintaining compassion and love , are some of the lessons which I learned from this classic movie . The actors were excellent and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good movies from this era of time , just as much as I do . Hope I can find more movies like this one .	1
This version has to the best version . A great movie . Visually beautiful with very strong perfomances by artist and characters you 'll love .	1
If you have read Victor Hugo 's Les Mis & eacute ; rables , you will find that this version is the best screen adaptation of the currently available four : the 1935 version with Frederic March & Charles Laughton ; the 1952 one with Michael Rennie & Robert Newton ; the 1978 one with Richard Jordan and Anthony Perkins and the current one ( 1998 ) with Liam Neeson , Geoffrey Rush and Uma Thurman . The acting is superb and Uma Thurman gives a stellar portrayal of Fantine that is the most convincing of all four Fantines . If you do n't have the time to read Victor Hugo 's book , this movie is the best substitute .	1
`` Les Miserables '' , the popular musical and play that has entertained many since its premiere in London back in 1985.But `` Les Miserables '' ( which translates to `` The Wretched '' or `` The Poor Ones '' ) goes back even further . More than 100 years into the past , when it was first written by Victor Hugo as a French historical fiction novel in 1862 . Considered as one of the greatest novels of the 19th century , the film has been entertaining generation after generation from its first film ( `` Victor Hugo et les principaux personnages des mis & eacute ; rables '' ) back in 1897 courtesy of the Lumiere Brothers and countless adaptations since.But its first big budget film adaptation was in 1998 courtesy of a film directed by Billie August ( `` House of the Spirits '' , `` Pelle the Conqueror '' ) and a screenplay by Rafael Yglesias ( `` Fearless '' , `` From Hell '' ) which was loosely based on Hugo 's popular novel . As the film adaptation was similar to Hugo 's novel , some characters who had a more prominent role in the book were removed entirely or their presence lessened in the film version as the primary focus is on the character of Jean Valjean.In December 2012 , a new British film for `` Les Miserables '' was released in theaters , but where this version of the film was a musical , the 1998 film was not . And now , the 1998 version of the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.VIDEO : '' Les Miserables '' is presented in 1080p High Definition ( 2:40:1 ) . Part of me was wondering if this film would look soft and how the clarity would look compared to the original DVD release . And I was quite pleased with how the film looked overall . During the outdoor sequences , especially during the parade , the scene looked vibrant and colorful . Indoor scenes were well-lit , even though the film was trying to capture certain scenes with less lighting , I did n't see any noise during those scenes . Closeups on the faces of the characters were well-detailed and clarity was much more apparent in the closeups of the scenes vs. its older DVD counterpart . Cinematography by Jorgen Persson ( `` My Life as a Dog '' , `` The House of Spirits '' ) was beautifully done ! Overall , picture quality was very good and I noticed no artifacts , banding or aliasing.AUDIO & SUBTITLES : '' Les Miserables '' is presented in English , French and Japanese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Portuguese Dolby Digital Surround Sound . The film is not a musical , so dialogue the film is primarily dialogue driven . Until the film gets to the scenes of the parade and revolt , the surround channels are then utilized for crowd ambiance but also gunfire . A musical score by Basil Poledouris ( `` Starship Troopers '' , `` The Hunt for Red October '' , `` Conan the Barbarian '' , `` Robocop '' ) is also featured throughout the film . But for the most part , the majority of the film is dialogue driven through the front and center-channels.Subtitles are in English SDH , English , Arabic , Danish , Dutch , Finnish , French , Japanese , Norwegian , Portuguese and Swedish.SPECIAL FEATURES : '' Les Miserables '' comes with the following special feature : A First Look at Les Miserables - ( 3:39 ) A short special feature featuring interviews with the cast of `` Les Miserables '' .EXTRAS : '' Les Miserables '' comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the movie to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers , tables or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL : I was very fortunate to be introduced to `` Les Miserables '' back during my high school years . As a person who took part in theater and one who enjoyed singing , I fell in love with the `` Les Miserables '' soundtrack and of course , the musical itself.But when I heard that `` Les Miserables '' was being adapted into a film , I did n't know how they could do it . As TV series before ( and after ) the 1998 film had to be shown as a mini-series because of its number of characters and how big the story is , there was just not much you can do with a 2 hr . film , unless a lot of storyline is cut out of the film.But upon watching the film for the first time , many years ago , the focus on the character of Jean Valjean would make sense . Eliminating the musical segments , Cosette not playing a major role , until she is older was a major change , not showcasing Eponine or Azelma changes the story a lot and most importantly , by not focusing too much on the love between Marius and Cosette especially the involvement of the Thernardiers towards the end . The story has changed a lot for the film adaptation.While I know purists who loved the musical or the novel may have cried foul that the story was changed , I felt that to make `` Les Miserables '' to a film without any sequels or to make it last over 3 hours long , to keep things within budget , important decisions of what trim had to be made . And in order to create a modified storyline of the novel without these characters , major changes had to be made . And for that , screenwriter Rafael Yglesias was able to successfully write a film that tries to keep the heart and soul of `` Les Miserable '' but also to keep the image of Jean Valjean as not only as a hero but a compassionate man who was able to change his life from an ex-convict to a mayor and as an industrialist who gave people a chance. , because even he himself was given a second chance to change his life.Liam Neeson did a wonderful job of playing the former convict , turned good guy and later on , father . This was a complex character which Neeson played with efficacy . But with Neeson highlighting his skills , you need an antagonist to match up with him and Geoffrey Rush played the role of Javert amazingly well . A conceited man , a stubborn man and a driven man , obsessed with catching Valjean , Rush did an amazing job portraying this role.While hardcore `` Les Miserables '' fans may also be ticked that the storyline of Cosette and Marius was changed drastically , writer Rafael Ygleasias was able to show that the two characters love one another , but also to show the relationship between Cosette and her papa Valjean . But the changes made for this film adaptation was to inspire hope but also to bring things full circle with a new storyline that shapes the final half of the film . But Claire Danes was able to take Cosette 's character and showcase a teen who has found love , while Hans Matheson was able to portray the role of a young man , so much in love , but also a man dedicated to the revolution.Sure , it 's sad that the revolution , Eponine , the Thernardiers play a smaller or non-existent role in this film adaptation . But once again , considering the changes that had to be made in order to keep the film to a little over two hours long , major cuts and restructuring of the plot to fit this duration had to be made.As for the Blu-ray release , compared to its previous DVD outlet the film looks better on Blu-ray but the noticeable aspect of the film in HD is its lossless soundtrack and bringing the ambiance of crowds and gunfire to this film , made things much more enjoyable this time around . I do believe that if you enjoyed this film and own it on DVD , it is worth upgrading to Blu-ray ! Special features only feature the one `` A First Look at Les Miserables '' featurette and that is it.Overall , the 1998 film `` Les Miserables '' may not be the same storyline that people watched in a musical , nor is it exactly what the original Victor Hugo novel had featured with its many characters and longer storyline . But to create a film adaptation of `` Les Miserable '' for a two hour film , it ' s not an easy task . Yet , filmmaker Billie August and writer Rafael Yglesias were both able to create a film that may be different from the original novel but yet manages to be exciting and compelling . `` Les Miserables '' , the 1998 film adaptation is recommended !	1
Victor Hugo nailed one of society 's imperfections in trying to make people adhere to the law without any mercy or compassion , which robs justice more than the original infraction . The theft of a loaf of bread to lessen the desparate cravings of his starving family , probably should n't go unpunished by some sort of community service or restitution to the seller . However , being incarcerated for 5 years and then being branded for life as a convict goes against any sense of real justice.I 'm often reminded of `` Les Miserables '' when I hear of grade school leaders issuing their `` no tolerance rules '' and then a young child is caught in violation , which results in a severe reprimand that scars the child for life . The callousness of handing down such sentencing with no apparent use of the discernment skills school leaders are usually esteemed for is the same miscarriage of justice witnessed by those familiar with this classic tale .	1
Wonderful movie ! Liam Neesam and Uma Thurman are great in their performances . Incredible scenery with beautiful music . An unexpected ending . I am very happy with this movie !	1
We were looking for the new version of this movie and ran across this one . It 's a well produced movie without the singing , pretty good .	1
The Bottom Line : This version of Les Miserables is well-acted with good production values and a fine sense of what to cut and what to keep from Hugos ' mammoth novel ; it 's a worthy adaptation and a very good film .	1
i found this version to tell more of the story , without the singing getting in the way of the acting	1
This movie is awesome . I do n't understand why it bombed so bad in the theaters ...	1
This version omits his time in prison and showing how he got there , takes up after he 's escaped . Have older version , and saw new musical version in Theater . All have their specific slant . It 's a very sad movie ( and story by Hugo ) , disturbing a bit , but this movie version less so than most .	1
I can understand that people are upset about the movie not following the book , but review the movie for the movie . This was an excellent movie with great acting and direction . You will not be disapointed by buying this film . If you like Liam Neeson or Jeffery Rush , then this is your film . It is well written , the sets are beautiful , and the costumes great . In summery , it does what every great movie should : it suspended my disbelief .	1
First of all I have no idea why this was named `` Mortal Thoughts . '' More appropriate would be , `` Fatal Lies '' or `` An Inadvertent Confession , '' or maybe `` Desperate Friends . `` Be that as it may , this is a superior thriller mainly because the story is compelling and the acting is first rate . Demi Moore who plays Cynthia is just outstanding . She commands the screen with her beautiful and expressive features and her great natural skill . If you do n't like her , I guarantee you will not like this movie because she dominates the film . She is as vivid and unforgettable as an Al Pacino or a Betty Davis.As an aside on the career of Demi Moore , I want to say that it 's a shame for her that her off-screen personality is not well liked , which in large part accounts for the fact that she is one of the most underrated , although one of the most often seen and hardest-working stars of the last fifteen years or so . This movie is an example of how she is ignored . The plain fact is her performance here is better than many who have won Oscars , and she was n't even nominated . Another problem for her is that this movie ( and others she has made ) are not the sort of films that the Academy pays much attention to . Mortal Thoughts ( which she co-produced , by the way ) is too low-budget , too `` common '' one might say , for any part in it to be taken seriously in an artistic sense . Too bad.Glenne Headly ( Joyce ) is also outstanding while Bruce Willis is excellent as Joyce 's drug-addled , boozing , wife-beating loser of a husband . The dialogue is right on , realistically depicting the lives of New Jersey beauty shop people while the plot told in ersatz flashbacks unfolds nicely with a fine tension.The story is that of two friends , Joyce and Cynthia who find they have to cover up a killing ( NOT a murder , but at worst a manslaughter , or better yet , a case of self-defense ) , but fall apart as the investigation closes in on them . In a sense they are both like Lady Macbeth with blood on their hands and no effective way to wash it off . They are both appropriately naive as young working-class women , and both act foolishly , as many of us might in their predicament.Here 's a nice bit of ironic dialogue . Joyce is questioning her ability to convince people about what happened . She tells Cynthia that she is n't a very good liar . But Cynthia reassures her : `` Joyce , you 're a terrific liar . You just lost confidence in yourself . `` This is all to the good as far as film-making goes . It is the ending that is the problem.One might ask , what happened to the ending ? Maybe I need to watch this again to be sure I did n't miss anything . But better yet , YOU watch it and you be the judge . What I think happened is director Alan Rudolph truncated it . Either that or he decided to try something artistic , which I do n't recommend in a commercial thriller flick . Maybe they just ran out of money and had to wrap it up . At any rate , we are left wondering what is going to happen and who actually did what to whom . Presumably , the last flashback from Cynthia tells us how Bruce Willis 's character met his end , but that does n't solve the problem of how or why [ somebody else ] was shot full of holes . Maybe the producers thought they would wrap it all up in a sequel . Actually , there 's enough there for one , easily.I would also like to complain about a movie that acts out a false story told by one of the characters as though the story were true . That can be done , but it must be done in such a way that there is some kind of hint or `` coloring '' of the story that allows the viewer to suspect that something is amiss . True , Det . John Woods ( Harvey Keitel ) makes some compelling arguments along the way to suggest that Cynthia is not telling the truth , but we are mislead by the actions that our eyes see and the sounds that our ears hear . In movies , since anything can be contrived , it is the usual rule to have the camera show the truth while letting the characters do the lying.What might have saved this ( and what I was expecting all the way through ) is Joyce 's side of the story acted out on screen so that we could compare the stories and make our choice about who was telling the truth.Bottom line : better than one might expect with a realistic edge clearly a notch or two above the usual thriller fare .	1
What happens when an action movie crosses over into the real world ? That 's the question explored in the early '90s cult action flick , Last Action Hero.Young Danny ( Austin O'Brian ) spends his time watching cheesy action flicks , particularly those by action star Jack Slater ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) . When an old projectionist gives Danny a magical ticket , Danny is transported into one of Jack 's movies where the laws of physics ( or reality ) do n't have much meaning . It seems like the perfect world for Danny until Jack 's nemesis ( Charles Dance ) finds the magic ticket and enters into the real world . It 's up to Danny and Jack to stop him , but without the luxury of movie magic.While many action movie fans ( such as myself ) will enjoy the cult nature of this movie , others will find it too corny and tongue-and-cheek . Last Action Hero , while expertly written and executed , is a parody of itself and of all ( especially '80s ) action movies , but in taking this route , has used too many `` in '' jokes . In fact , a few of the jokes even had to be explained to me , because I did n't understand all the little nuances of the screenplay . I can easily understand why some viewers wo n't enjoy the film 's style of humor , but I can also see how it became a cult classic.The picture quality is absolutely phenomenal . It 's so crisp and clear that , quality-size , it feels like a modern movie . The colors are so vivid that the film feels like it 's jumping off the screen ( almost literally , making the nature of the movie itself even more interesting ) . I 've never seen this film ( okay , so I missed the DVD version and only saw the VHS version ) ever presented in such a beautiful way before.The sound has also been improved , and instead of having to turn the volume way up in order to hear anything outside of the action sequences , it was considerably more manageable . Between the picture and the sound , all of the over-the-top , corny action sequences really came to life here and made me feel like I was part of the action ( which seems to be a key aspect of the movie 's original intent ) . Presented in crystal-clear 1080p high definition in 2.40:1 widescreen , this is the best quality Last Action Hero can ever have . This edition also has Spanish , French , and Portuguese audio as well as English , Spanish , French , and Portuguese subtitles.However , I found the bonus material here ( or lack thereof ) very disappointing . Now , since I 've only see this movie before on VHS , I do n't know what was included on the original DVD release ( if anything ) , but I was hoping for a little more in this version of the movie aside from just gorgeous sound and impeccable visuals . Instead , Last Action Hero on Blu-ray features Movie IQ , which allows for semi-annoying ( if you have n't seen the movie a few times before ) pop-ups that give interesting information about the film , and Blu Live , which seems to be a common feature among all Blu-ray movies meant to direct viewers to Sony 's online store . There 's no deleted scenes or outtakes ( my personal favorite extras ) or even interviews with cast and/or crew . While I understand that since this an older movie and keeping up with extra features was very different then , you would think that they could have come up with something.It 's difficult to say whether or not the Blu-ray edition of Last Action Hero is worth it , especially with the serious lack of bonus features and the relatively high price tag associated with Blu-ray disks . If you are looking for flawless video and audio quality , then the Blu-ray is the perfect choice , but if you 're looking for new material , then save your money and check out the DVD ( or even VHS ) version of the movie .	1
Granted , LAST ACTION HERO ( 1993 ) is probably aimed at pre-teen boys , yet it 's a personal favorite . I 'm one of this film 's loyal fans.At the time it was making the theatrical rounds I worked at Sears Brand Central in their electronics division . We had a dedicated laser disc player that repeated every 30 minutes a selection of movie promos , plus Sears and other commercials . These discs were changed monthly.For a couple of cycles , `` Last Action Hero '' was a featured item . The ad included some fine concert footage of AC/DC 's `` Big Gun . '' A portion of this track opens the picture 's final credit scroll . Arnold appears in character during the Sears video while Angus Young does his famous schoolboy prance on stage.The soundtrack ofLAST ACTION HEROis a metal or rocker fan 's delight . It includes cuts by Alice in Chains , Megadeath , Fishbone , Def Leppard , Anthrax , Cypress Hill , Queensryche and Aerosmith . Tesla has the title track.The reason I 'm particularly fond of this one is its references to classic movies , including Hamlet , in a fab b & w ; scene where Arnold as a grungy machine gun packing Dane says , `` To be or not to be '' and lights a bomb off his stogie . He tosses the TNT . Big explosion behind him and then a drolly given , `` Not to be '' ends the sequence.Best of all is Ian McKellen 's take on the Grim Reaper from Ingmar Bergman'sTHE SEVENTH SEAL ( 1957 ) . Honorable mention to Tom Noonan 's horribly scarred axe-wielding villain . He and Arnold play dual roles : themselves the actors and their action film characters.It 's a great concept : young Austin O'Brien ( as Danny Madigan ) steps into a movie and then he and other fictional characters cross back into the real world . That L.A. police station on the other side of the screen is great . We also get a holographic glimpse here of Arnold 's Terminator foe in cop drag , and Danny DeVito provides the voice of 'Whiskers , ' a cartoon cat detective . Also here , Austin/Danny I.D.s a confused F. Murray Abraham as Mozart 's killer ( rememberAMADEUS ? ) .At the video store , Sylvester Stallone is seen on a lifesize cardboard stand up display asTHE TERMINATOR . Jack Slater ( Arnold ) raves about how good Sly is in the role to a shocked Danny . It 's too funny ! Oh , and other bad puns , like when Slater kills a villain with an ice cream stuck in the eyeball , he quips : `` Iced that guy ... to cone a phrase ! `` Yes , I 've seen LAST ACTION HERO many times and will many more !	1
The following story will tell you why this movie bombed at the box office.While visiting family in Miami one of my cousins went to see the movie . When he got home he was telling me how much the movie stunk . As he was talking it became obvious to me that he had taken the movie seriously . So I yelled at him `` It 's a parody ! ! He 's making fun of action movies in general and himself in particular ! ! '' I could see the lightbulb go on over his head and he went right out and saw it again.Needless to say , he loved the film . As do I . It 's not often that a big star has the guts to make fun of himself just to make his fans laugh . So if you have this film languishing in your collection somewhere you need to see it with this in mind . It 's parody . Satire . Comedy ! Watch it and have fun .	1
I am a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger/action movie fan . I own almost all of his movies . Without being Arnold biased , this is a great movie . A very good story with lots of action . I highly recommend . Classic !	1
Amazing blend of top-tier 90 's action mixed with intelligent satire of the genre . McTiernan delivers one of the best Schwarzenneger flicks , in the prime of his career .	1
If you do n't like Arnold Schwarzenegger movies then you do n't deserve to like his movies at all and that 's the truth .	1
saw this many times on tvloved itit was hilarioustouching and very powerfulI like the actingthe scenerythe direction and directingI give all of Arnold 's movies a chancebecause you ca n't always please everyone.and he did a good job on this in my eyesit 's a classic comedy/action movie and it 's brilliantI got this on dvd now and will watch it again and again . it 's just too memorable to forget a movie like this .	1
Forget what the critics said . This movie works beautifully on several different levels . As an action spoof it is hilarious , with many in-jokes , gags and cameos . As a fantasy it is ingenious with Austin O'Brien very appealing as a kid with a & quot ; magic ticket & quot ; that can transport him from the real world into the fake world of action films . And it works splendidly as a send up of Schwarzenegger 's movie image giving him a big chance to do what he does best-poke fun at himself . It also works as one of the most original buddy movies ever . There is a lot going on here and it will take a few viewings to catch everything but that is what makes a good movie good . The action is wall-to-wall , no doubt , like many other action films , good or bad . The sequences are very well done but contrived , just like many of those previously mentioned films . But they are contrived for a reason-to spoof the genre . Because a lot of people who originally saw this did n't get it , it is , in this critic 's humble opinion , one of the most misunderstood films of all time . That accounted for its bad reviews and low box office . But it is my belief that this was largely due to poor marketing . When Schwarzenegger ( who served as executive producer ) would appear on television to plug it , he made a fatal mistake . His description of this as a family movie was wrong . It is very violent , even though that too is done for a purpose . Imagine what a lot of parents thought when they took their kids to see this and within the first fifteen minutes or so , several people are killed or injured and there are gunshots and explosions galore . It is a mistake that to this day Arnold 's career has n't been able to completely recover from.Be that as it may , you must see this film for what it is and enjoy imagination and spoof at its finest . You will not be disappointed !	1
It 's so strange to me that this movie tanked at the box office . This is one of the most entertaining movies I 've seen , and it comes with a message that even children understand . In this movie Schwarzenegger plays a movie hero . One of his biggest fans , a boy , gets sucked into the movie with him . While in the movie the boy sees first hand that what happens in movies is completely unrealistic . When Schwarzenegger and the boy get pulled form the movie into real life , the opposite occurs and Schwarzenegger gets to see the real life is not like the movies . If you get shot , you get hurt and might die . If you shoot your gun at a car it does n't explode . If you punch a window , it actually hurts . And women in real life ? Well , they 're not all super models . Etc.It 's one of those movies that everyone in Hollywood wanted to be in and so there are loads of very famous actors and actresses in it . It 's funny . It 's exciting . It 's very tongue-in-cheek .	1
*** This review may contain spoilers ***Im one of those few people who got the joke . I got the joke back in 1993 when it came out . I know that this movie was meant to spoof those absurd action movies . Its these bonehead cookie-cutter critics that do n't get that point . Bunch of pinheads keep saying the same thing because they allow weirdos like Roger Ebert and smarmy d***heads like Richard Roeper dictate to them what qualifies as quality movies . Check out the negative reviews on this site . They all go along the lines of `` worst movie I 've ever seen '' . Simple-minded predictable sheep . And now ... ... . the review.Premise : Daniel ( Austin O'Brien ) gets a magic ticket from a movie store owner given to him by Houdini . While watching the latest Jack Slater movie , Daniel gets transported into the movie itself and ends up joining Jack Slater ( played by Arnold ) in his crazy adventures . This particular adventure involves Jack finding out the killer of his brother.Opinion : There are plenty of good things to say about this movie and very little bad things to say about this movie . The action is plentiful and the sets look great . That kid is annoying little wimp though ( I must have watched this movie 10 times and still find that kid insufferable ) . The humor hits ( the outlandish stunts , shooting TNT away with bullets , the hackneyed catchphrases , a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc ) . My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid . Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is ! Plus he is a major wimp . You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife , dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing ? What a wuss ! Besides these flaws , this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up . A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks and compared to the rubbish that passes for parody now ( Date Movie , Epic Movie , Disaster Movie , Meet The Spartans etc ) it holds up well after all these years.I 'll leave you on this note : Not every movie that bombs at the box office is bad and not every movie that succeeds in the box office is good . There are plenty of movies that failed at the box office that are good and there are some movies that succeeded at the box office that stink to high heaven . Stop being a trend-follower and see for yourself.Last Action Hero : the most underrated parody of all time .	1
In the 1993 adventure film , LAST ACTION HERO , Arnold Schwarzeneggger reteams with director JOHN McTIERNAN ( Predator ) as Jack Slater , the action hero of the 90 's . Big time movie fan , young Danny Madigan ( Austin O'Brien ) receives a magic ticket from his old pal Nick- the projectionist of the films . After getting a chance to see the new JACK SLATER movie before it opens , Danny is enjoying the action packed-soon to be-blockbuster when the ticket starts glowing . A stick of dynamite blasts through the screen and BOOM ! Danny is in the movie as Jack 's comedic sidekick . Then , when Danny becomes Slater 's new partner , he must track down Tony Vavawldi and his henchman Mr. Benedict . The adventure is on ! MY REVIEW : & quot ; This is obviously an underated SCHWARZENEGGER adventure flick ! It was sweet ! The action , the explosions , the humor , the one liners- all good . Of course this is n't ARNOLD 's best movie , but it does pretty well ! It may unbelievable , but what ARNOLD movie is n't ? Think- TERMINATOR 1 & amp ; 2 , PREDATOR , THE RUNNING MAN , END OF DAYS , THE SIXTH DAY , JUNIOR , TOTAL RECALL , TWINS- all unbelievable ARNOLD films- but still entertaining ! ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER and AUSTIN O'BRIEN make the best team ! LAST ACTION HERO rocks ! The opening scene says it all ! Have fun ! That 's what fantasy movies are all about ! So enjoy this fun flick to catch with friends or just to watch with popcorn ! & quot ; - MJV & amp ; the Movies .	1
a fun film , swarzenegger at his normal , in a funny , though childish at times , action film . I doubt very seriously that it ever won rave reviews in the theaters , but it has elements that make it entertaining and funny for adults , and yet for that pre teen son or daughter who likes action movies , it is clean , mostly bloodless all action . Oh people get shot , blown up and killed left and right , but you never see a wound , never see blood , see a cartoon cat , and a fat mafia guy passing gas . Car chases , bullets flying , explosions , and a cute premise	1
The Theatre sound was way too loud but I liked the idea of this movie and it 's connection t5o other movies . A great Super Hero Comedy . I think Arnold has some spunk left in him yet !	1
Schwarzenegger plays a double role here , that of himself , and that of a movie character . But I wo n't say more for spoilers ! A fine comedy well worth watching.The movie arrived in fine time but the disc needed extra cleaning and buffing to play right , but it does .	1
I came across this masterpiece by accident , but from the start of the film I was thoroughly engrossed in what turned out to be a classic film about human nature . More movies of this ilk should be made , as it was entertaining , while being completely believable.This is a movie that I will purchase and watch over and over again . Bravo to the directors and actors , who made this little-known film so superb ! Although this movie contains some violence , it certainly is appropriate for teenagers .	1
For some reason the review I submitted right after seeing this DVD did n't make it onto the website so I 'm writing another . Since it 's not fresh in my mind I 'll just add my `` vote '' to the others who recommend this.To me , some stories are worth telling and some are n't . This is one that is ! And it 's brilliantly filmed and acted . Others ' have recounted the story so I wo n't repeat it . But it 's a tale of substance , worth your time and attention .	1
It 's unclear who `` Character '' - which otherwise tells the story of a luckless man locked in battle with his biological father - refers to . Set in Europe after the first world war , `` Character '' presents us with a fearsome figure : Arend Dreverhaven ( Jan Declair ) , the local `` Bailiff '' . In uncertain times , when nobody can be sure how long they 'll have a job or a roof over their head , Dreverhaven fearlessly and contemptuously wields his power to divest whole communities of both . Physically large , he can stare down whole battalions of armed communists single-handedly , or jump into the sea to re-possess a ship . ( In a chilling dream sequence , he evicts an entire building 's tenants wearing no more than his bailiff 's medal . ) In a lesser film , Dreveraven would be easy to dismiss as a coward , cloaking his weakness behind the power of the office , but `` Character '' goes a braver route - Dreverhaven has his fears , but he 's still the power behind the position . He 's driven to possess the one thing he ca n't get - the love of Joba , his former housekeeper and the one woman who slept with him . Though the script is murky on whether Joba consented to their coupling , she makes it crystal clear that she wants nothing to do with him - whether for herself or their `` son '' . Proving she 's as strong willed as Dreverhaven , she coldly rebuffs his efforts to control or support them , especially the pathological way he repeatedly proposes to her over the years - even as the two enter the inescapable redoubt of old age . Not taking `` no '' for answer very well , Dreverhaven wages a war against Jacob Willem , the illegitimate son who will rise into respectable manhood by dint of serious labor.Though already having the world against him , ( poverty and bastardy are bad enough alone ) Jacob finds himself under the gun . Dreverhaven buys up Jacob 's debts , hounding the boy into poverty . Jacob rises to the occasion - he defeats Dreverhaven in bankruptcy court , twice . He even nabs a job as a clerk in the town 's house of finance , a move with potential for a respectable and lucrative future , light years away from the wretched existence into which he was born . Unfortunately , Willem too is driven by fear and hatred of the old man - having just redeemed his last debts to Dreverhaven , he boldly incurs a new one , relishing the chance to beat the old man again . He also confuses success with happiness , discarding a pretty fellow worker whose affections offer him nothing in his private war . Dreverhaven 's motives are unclear - though the script ingeniously works this dilemma into the story . Dreverhaven boldly tells Joba that he 'll strangle his son for nine-tenths to make a man out of him , since that 's the only way he can legitimize Jacob Willem as his son . He obviously wants Joba , but only if he can make their boy into a mirror image of himself . When Joba rebuffs him one last time , however , he decides it 's time to go after that last 10th . Unfortunately , for both our heroes and the story , Joba soon dies , a move that robs the story of its emotional force and complexity , and boils it down to a clash of wills in which both characters go after that last bit of their lives left un-strangled . It 's no surprise who survives the other - the script is based on Jacob 's `` confession '' to the police after the old man is found dead in the solitary gloom of his office , after a fight Jacob admits the two had.While serious film lovers see it as an alternative to Hollywood sludge ( another reviewer wrote that , I did n't make it up ) , the film 's theme of `` father v. son '' is pure Hollywood . The script 's sub-text of an evil-elder figure who elevates a younger hero by making his life hell was already old when Willem Defoe used it in `` Spiderman '' . ( James Earle Jones used it against Mark Hamill in the `` Star Wars '' movies and against Schwarzennegar in the first `` Conan '' flick - and that was over 20 years ago ! ) Also , the film 's obviously high production values means it will never be a favorite with the Dogme set . That said , `` Character '' gives us the timeless Oedipal battle with less than heroic figures . When Jacob 's mother coolly condemns him for missing out on a chance for love , it sounds mean , but we all know she 's right . Fedja van Huet plays Jacob as terrified but resolute against the bailiff , looking strangely like Robert Downey Jr. would if he starred in `` Cabinet of Dr. Caligari '' . Declair however , is a monster as Dreverhaven , even when his motives seem good , and he rules this flick . Character is incomplete , and yet unforgettable .	1
The flawed characters give this mysterious movie its brilliant flavor . A silent mother , a cold , unfeeling father and a son trying desperately to win their love and approval . The movie `` Character '' marches its viewing audience along a grief stricken , no thrills scenic route . The booming musical score gives the feeling of a quickening downhill death march where you know you must soon face the powerful enemy , to the death . But what if the enemy is you ? It 's a movie that captures your attention with a questionable circumstance , then whisks you along toward the climaxing conclusion that may hold the answers . It thrives on unfulfiilled ambitions , desires , loves and needs . The lead actors play their roles to perfection , but I must point out two of the supporting cast members who bring out the flavor of the story with their unique seasonings . Look for Lorna and De Gankelaar to add a few dashes of colorful spice to what might otherwise be a bland and tiresome stew . Though the main struggle appears to be between father and son , you ca n't help but see the struggles many characters have with themselves and their choices . I highly recommend this epic foreign language movie .	1
This movie is one of my favorites . It keeps me on the edge of my seat watching this story unfold .	1
This is my favorite Muppet Christmas film . Where else can you find the muppets , Fraggle Rock , and Seseme Street all in one place ? There are some hilarious moments and good writing , especially in a scene where Burt and Ernie talk to the man renting the house . Well worth the investment !	1
I am apparently one of the 10 people in the world who did n't see this show when it was played on TV in the late 80 's , nor since . That being said , I quite enjoyed it . It was fun to see all the of the different Muppet incarnations , at that time , come together to celebrate Christmas . The songs were fun , and contrary to many of the reviews , the plotline does not suffer greatly from the missing material . Of course , it does suffer if you had seen that material for years and it is suddenly gone on the DVD version , but that was n't the case for me . BTW , to the purists , I felt that when Animal jumped through the screen and cut the Muppet Babies part very short , it was a blessing , because they 're annoying ... All in all , good Christmas fare and a great deal when bought in the 2-pack with Emmet Otter 's Jugband Christmas .	1
This is probably my favorite Christmas special or close to it . When I saw that it was on dvd I was going to buy it right away , but sadly I found out it 's heavily edited and extremely over priced . So I found out the UK region 2 version of the movie was the full complete version for less than 20 $ . It came in less than 3 weeks and it was coming from the UK going to me here in Ontario Canada , so not bad at all . The only thing is for anyone who knows about dvd 's knows that region 2 dvd 's will not play in a region 1 dvd player , which is North America . What I did was copy the movie onto my computer , got rid of the region codes and burned it onto a disk and it played perfectly on my dvd player . So if anyone wants a full complete copy of this movie this is your best bet . Oh and I forgot to mention that you can find the dvd on amazon.co.uk in case if anyone did n't know that .	1
I lost my original copy of this movie in a hurricane so when I found it on amazon , I was beyond elated . it is truly the cutest little Christmas movies filled with the Muppet legacy . great music and funny jokes . definitely worth the buy .	1
As a professional puppeteer myself , I can look at this production a bit differently than other viewers . I am sometimes critical of the manipulation and content of some Muppet productions , but Emmet Otter is one of the finest puppet creations by the Muppets or any other puppeteer I know . It departs for what can be called & quot ; Muppet cute & quot ; and , except for some brief sections of the talent show that are more typical Muppet , is a beautiful film . The music could not be better , the voice are perfection and the manipulation flawless . Normally the Muppets use hand , rod and mouth puppets , but there are sections of this production that also use marionettes ( string puppets ) . Whenever there are long shots of the characters walking or skating on the ice , these are the marionettes . Everything about the production is of exceptional quality . There are wonderfully & quot ; quiet & quot ; sections that are delightful and add a lot to the tone of the story.The story is one of the most uplifting and delightful of all the Christmas specials . It is a tape that can be watched over and over at any time of year . The message that love is the most important thing should not be confined to just one season.I have had my copy of & quot ; Emmet Otter & quot ; since it first came out on a Disney release so am not aware of any editing . However , I have given copies of the newer version to friends and they have all loved it , so unless you are a puriest , enjoy one of the BEST holiday productions ever .	1
This is the most touching addaptation of the & quot ; Gift of the Magi & quot ; that I have ever seen . Masterfully created by Jim Henson ( and featuring Kermit the Frog ) , this story will touch everyone who sees it with it 's characters , messages , music and humor . It is visually STUNNING and truly brings the spirit of Christmas home .	1
Anyone thinking the unrated version is going to have extended motel or pool scenes will be sorely disappointed in this `` unrated '' version . I think there was maybe one extra scene . The difference in the two can be summed up using an expression of Adam Sandler 's , `` Big Whoppedee Do '' .So if you have the `` R '' version already , save your $ 10 bucks.UPDATE . Well this little gem has popped up on Blu RayWild Things ( Unrated Edition ) [ Blu-ray ] and those of us that bought it have the dilemma of whether or not to take the plunge and buy it again . I for one , am because its a great movie . Unfortunately , as with the earlier DVDs there are no extras . So now I own 3 , yes 3 different DVD versions of the same movie . Oh , and I bought the soundtrack years ago too . LOL	1
WILD THINGS is the best modern noir-thriller since BODY HEAT ! The plot is a flurry of double-crosses , back-stabs , and betrayals ! It 's a wonderful tale of greed , treachery , and deceit the first time around . Subsequent viewings are still worthwhile due to snappy , humorous dialogue and interestingly twisted characters . Neve Campbell ( SCREAM 1-4 , THE CRAFT ) , Denise Richards ( STARSHIP TROOPERS , VALENTINE ) , Kevin Bacon ( TREMORS , STIR OF ECHOES , HOLLOW MAN , RIVER WILD , DEATH SENTENCE , etc . ) , and Matt Dillon make up the black heart of the film . Bill Murray adds mirth as only he can , playing a bottom-feeding lawyer . A classic ...	1
Wild Things Unrated edition you have to watch the movie all the way threw to understand the movie and all the twists of the movie . The main one being during the end credits , of course I 'm not going to ruin it for people who have yet to see this movie . One of the main aspects of the movie is you have who is working for who , and who is playing one another . Because in the end that many millions it comes down to who wants it the most and who can come up with a plan to get away with it . The movie combines drama , action , greed , lust , desire , and revenge . Bonus note the actors did a great acting job based on what they had to work with , and enjoy the music of the movie alot .	1
This is the best `` camp '' erotic film in the past quarter century , hands down . Not only is it a guilty pleasure for viewers of lesbian acts , but it also shows Kevin Bacons acting skills , which are n't the highest to begin with ( he was also the Executive Producer ) , which probably explains why we get a gratuitous shot of his penis.I think the true shinning point of the film , is Bill Murray 's off-script banter as Matt Dillons laywer . How they got him into this blatant flesh romp is a total wonderment to myself , but without him , I 'd be laughing for ALL the wrong reasons.If you 're looking for beautiful scenery of both Florida , and the nakedness of Denise Richards and a rather good looking for her age Theresa Russell , then you will never miss with this over-the-top indulgence in camp film making history.A true gem that beats `` Basic Instinct '' ... hands down !	1
This film is filled with the best plot twists that i have ever seen in a movie . It does have some great acting and some great suspense . I will not lie to you , this is a very steamy movie , and i kinda liked it ! The 3-way scene is notorious , a classic , buy it just for that scene ! ! ! But , even without that scene , i enjoyed the movie , it still would get 5 stars . Highly reccomended ! 9.4 out of 10 !	1
A school teacher is accused of rape . After being found innocent , he rakes in a fortune in damages . Turns out that his accuser was in league with him to extort her mother for a ton of money . A detective , and a reckless , rebel are also on their heels , and may bring their plot to light.This movie has a pretty good cast , and story . It 's a great movie to watch once . I think that the sex was focused on too much . I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Denise Richards getting it on in this movie , but that theme can only carry a movie so far . I think that Bill Murray and Kevin Bacon saved this movie from total failure with their performances . I recommend renting this film , I think deciding to buy it is totally up to the individual .	1
Unlike many customers who reviewed this movie , I did not rent it because of the 3-some scene . I did n't know a thing about this movie when I rented it . I have to say this movie was just awesome . I think the effect was really powerful on me cuz I had no expectations at all . Once the plot started twisting , it never stopped . Everytime I thought I knew what was going on , I would find out just how wrong I was . The basic rule of thumb with this movie is this , when you think the story ca n't possibily twist again , it will twist one more time ! Its a must see movie ! Great story and awesome performences by the actors . A nice change for Neve Campbell might I add ! If you have n't see it , please do , you wo n't regret it !	1
This is a really awesome movie . Well cast and well acted , Matt , Denise , Neve and Kevin do a great job as the main characters in this film . The storyline is interesting and all the twists and turns will keep you watching , just try to predict the ending . The score is also prefect for the film , if you havnt seen this go rent it now .	1
Too hot even for me ! This movie must have come out of an oven , it 's burning with hot ! I can taste the spices , yes ! Mr. Lombardo ( Matt Dillon ) is a respected high school teacher in Miami who is accused of raping his students . I was flabbergasted with the deceit and wrongful accusations in this movie . Denise Richards is a popular cheerleader and Neve Campbell is a bayou chick ! Do n't eat alligators and careful with those snakes . Bill Murray is a shady lawyer who helps Lombardo get out of jail . Even Kevin Bacon is in this ! Hamanee stars are there ? I feel like taking a vacation to Miami and living the life by sailing . The movie has plenty of twists and you 'll be surprised with the ending . I needed some ice to cool down the television !	1
This film was a pleasantly nasty surprise -- or maybe it was a nastily pleasant surprise . Whatever . I first saw it on cable after a lot of friends recommended it , and I could n't believe an American film company would go so far out on a limb with such dark material . It seems much more like something the Europeans would do . I 'm very proud that it 's an American movie -- it proves that we can sometimes make sophisticated black comedies like everyone else . The cast is perfect , the script is wonderfully twisty ( and twisted ) , and everyone involved should be very proud of themselves . Thank you , John McNaughton , and please make more movies like this . Bill Murray for President ! Highly recommended .	1
The writing and directing team of Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan ( Josie and the Pussycats ) met at film school and discovered that their respective parents were friends and they had both gone to High School at the same time in Philadelphia , just a few miles apart from each other . When Harry met Deborah would make a great movie , but maybe it already has , it was just called `` Ca n't Hardly Wait . '' If they had just gone to the same High School , instead of two nearby ones , they could have been Amanda Beckett and Preston Meyers ( I 'm betting this is from Harry 's perspective ) or Kenny Fisher and Denise Fleming ( Deborah 's , anyone ? ) .Preston Meyers ( Ethan Embry ) fell in love with Amanda Beckett ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ) the first moment he saw her . It was fate that threw them together , because they were both eating strawberry Pop-Tarts . Who can deny that the strawberry Pop-Tarts were an omen ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Preston : [ narrating ] It was October , freshman year . First time in history that I 'd ever missed the bus . If I had arrived on time , I never would 've seen her . But as it was , I was the first person at Huntington Hills High to set eyes on Amanda Beckett . It was her first day at school . Then , I 'm sitting in class enjoying a late breakfast when out of all the classrooms in the entire school , she walks into mine . And where does the teacher sit her ? Right next to me ! Now , up until now , one could write this off to coincidence . But then she reaches in her bag and pulls out a strawberry Pop-Tart - the very same breakfast pastry I was consuming at that moment ! What was I to do ? How was I to proceed ? ======================================How was he to proceed , indeed ? Preston 's head was in the clouds ; but by the time he cleared his thoughts Amanda had already been snatched up by Mike ( Peter Facinelli ) , a shallow and conceited jock . Nevertheless , Preston believes in the portentous strawberry Pop-Tarts , and pours his feelings into a letter to Amanda that he constantly revises . As further evidence that he and Amanda are meant to be together he hears `` Mandy '' by Barry Manilow on the radio just as he is going to the graduation party . A party where Amanda will be in attendance , having just broken up with Mike . Mandy , short for Amanda -- could anything be more fortuitous ? Preston asks his friend , Denise Fleming , what she thinks of the signs , fate , and the latest revision of his letter to Amanda . Denise is skeptical . She is the clever red headed outsider , rolling her eyes at the High School hijinks , while secretly wishing that she could be popular . Maybe she 'd like to be more than friends with Preston , too , but all he thinks about is Amanda , 24/7 . `` What am I , chopped liver ? '' Denise probably asks herself.Meanwhile , Kenny Fisher thinks he is tres cool , but while he emulates the speech and fashion of Afro Americans , on him it just looks comical . It did n't work for Joseph Gordon-Levitt in `` Havoc , '' either. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Denise : There 's a mirror right there . Take a look , you 're white.==========================So now you get the gist of `` Ca n't Hardly Wait . '' It is about a big party right after High School graduation , where Freaks , Geeks , Jocks , and Frocks all frolic , some with hidden agendas , and some with agendas not hidden at all , completely and totally blatant . If you were persecuted in High School , perhaps you can relate . The script very much favors the clever misfits , and forecasts the day when the smart will finally prevail . Hard to believe that will ever happen to geeks like this , but it makes for a nice wishful fantasy. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -X-Phile 1 : You know what ? My retainer looks like a Klingon warship.========================== '' Ca n't Hardly Wait '' is very well written , and juggles the multiple story balls well . The direction was none too shabby , either . With Harry and Deborah , you get two points of view for the price of one . There are many Rashomon moments . Raging High School kegger that careens out of control ? Tres cliche . But `` Ca n't Hardly Wait '' rises above the triteness of the material . There are tons of actors and actresses here who will go on to greater fame , and others who are headed for oblivion -- or television . It is fun just to watch the falling or shooting stars.Jennifer Love Hewitt is really cute . Wow . She 's acutely cute . Excrutiatingly cute also were Nicole Bilderback and Tamala Jones . Lauren Ambrose gave a very nuanced performance as Denise Fleming . Seth Green took many chances as Kenny Fisher , but I 'm not sure that the chances he took paid off . He should get points for enthusiasm . Lose the goggles , though. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Kenny Fisher : Why y'all got ta waste my flava ? =================I Love You , Man ( 2009 ) Jason Segel was Sydney Fife ; and Jaime Pressly was DeniseParty Monster ( 2003 ) Seth Green was James St. JamesJosie and The Pussycats ( 2001 ) Written & Directed by Harry Elfont & Deborah Kaplan ; Seth Green was Travis - Du Jour ; and Breckin Meyer was Marco - Du JourHeartbreakers ( 2001 ) Jennifer Love Hewitt was Page ConnersBring It On ( Widescreen Collector 's Edition ) ( 2000 ) Nicole Bilderback was WhitneyCruel Intentions ( 1999 ) Selma Blair was Cecile CaldwellThe Ed Wood Collection - A Salute to IncompetenceI Woke Up Early the Day I Died ( 1998 ) Summer Phoenix was Bartender # 2/Girl at the BeachBooty Call ( 1997 ) Tamala Jones was NikkiThat Thing You Do !

This movie came out just before the teen flick rennaissance , and remains a cult favorite instead of a box-office smash . It 's as good or better than the party/prom flicks that followed it , and a worthwhile addition to anyone 's DVD collection.The two romantic leads are great : Ethan Embry 's pop-eyed earnestness makes him likeable , Jennifer Love Hewitt gets to show the downside of being beautiful and adored ( poor kid ) . There are also plenty of notable cameos . Jenna Elfman ( Dharma and Greg ) has a funny bit as a stripper/angel , the always welcome Seth Green is pretty fly for a white guy , and Charlie Korsmo gets laughs as a geek who enters the social stratosphere by lip-syncing & quot ; Paradise City. & quot ; All in all a funny , feel-good movie . But the commentary on the DVD left me hungry for more . The directors had to cut several scenes , and re-edit others , to insure a PG-13 rating from the MPAA . The scenes that they talk about sound hilarious . They also describe how several awkwardly cut scenes should have played . The scenes sound brilliant . So , why not put a director 's cut on the disc ? How hard would it be ? I 'd like to actually see the movie the director wanted to make , not just hear about it . One of the points of DVD is to give the director that final say.So one star docked for the DVD edition , but still a worthy addition to any teen-movie ( John Hughes and the next generation ) fan .	1
It really is a shame that Ethan Embry has not gained more starring roles . though many of his films feature him as a goofy guy , Ca n't Hardly Wait is his proof that he can play a leading man wonderfully.This simple story of a man in love is jam-packed with an all star cast that creates perfect little subplots that all come together in the end . it 's hysterical ! cheesy when it 's supposed to be and serious when needed.In the last scene , the two main characters finally come together and share great chemistry when they finally do . it also shows that ethan embry , aside from being a great actor , is one of the best on-screen kissers i 've ever seen .	1
I love this and it works very well . I will keep buying more due to the cost and quailty of the product	1
Loved it even though it is for kids ... you ca n't go wrong ... you do n't have to worry that something inappropriate is going to pop up when you are out of the room ... it was funny and sweet . More kids should have a film like this in their collection . And I think it is more for girls than boys - though a young boy say 3 - 6 might enjoy it . I liked it better than ANNIE . Though ANNIE has been redone several times . I wish they would have made part two to this watching Madeline grow up . Another movie good like this was MATILIDA . Danny DeVito ... was in that ... .	1
I love Hatty Jones in this one . She is good and her best friend . I wish there was madeline two . I have a lot of madeline dvds and videos .	1
I was 10 when this came out and was so excited in 1998 . Its still an adorable movie - no spoilers its a mash up of the 1st Madeline books and several others Ludwig B. created .	1
This may be one of the most violent movies of all time . The horrors of ethnic cleansing are seen up close and personal . I found myself often wishing to look away from the screen . Dennis Quaid plays the part of a moral monster and war criminal who is provided a fateful chance for limited redemption . He is an American French Foreign Legionnaire who comes across a young Bosnian Serbian woman ( Natasa Ninkovic ) about to give birth to her Muslim rapist 's daughter . She is not perceived as a victim by her family , but a disgusting whore who should have preferred suicide . The story primarily revolves around Quaid 's attempt to save their lives.Director Peter Antonijevic pulls no punches in depicting a high number of these Bosnian inhabitants as reactionary and cruel to each other . The values of pluralism , mercy , and forgiveness are seemingly alien concepts . I totally agree with Antonijevic 's decision to avoid the alleged political reasons for this insanity . There are no rational or moral justifications for these crimes against humanity . To focus on the political underpinnings of the Balkan conflicts is to do an injustice to the victims . The perpetrators simply used them as petty rationalizations.This is not a great film . It needed to be a edited down by around ten minutes to provide it with a quicker pace . My guess is that the finances did n't permit Director Antonijevic sufficient time and resources to fine tune his creation . The acting , though , is superb and many of the scenes dramatically riveting , andunforgettable . Both Quaid and Ninkovic would have certainly garnered major acting ward nominations had Savior been a huge financial success . I strongly encourage anyone who is at least a teenager to view this movie at least once in their life . If nothing else , it should encourage you to actively seek ways of preventing future instances of genocide .	1
A warning to all . This is NOT a & quot ; feel-good & quot ; movie . For how can it be ? It is about terrorists and the war in Bosnia , and in representing the insane brutality , this film does n't waver and pulls no punches . Much like & quot ; Schindler 's List & quot ; , you 'll sit horrified as this depressing film tells its shattering tale . Here you have a hero that is a mass murderer and cold-blooded sniper for the Serbs -- a killer of men and even children . That should tell you something right there.Dennis Quaid gives the performance of his life as Joshua Rose , a U.S. military officer stationed in France . He needed to give such a performance because the subject matter deserves no less . Matter-of-fact , the acting throughout is top-drawer . Oddly , the beautiful Nastassja Kinski gets a top billing , but she really only has a cameo roll . Especially haunting is Natasa Ninkovic in her roll as Vera , a victim of a Muslim rape and carrying an unwanted child . Peter Antonijevic 's direction ( see Amazon 's review ) is steadfast in its relentless pursuit to lay before us the absolute cruelty of ethnic hatreds -- a war where there are no winners , only survivors whose twisted sense of honor leaves us shaking our heads in utter disdain and disbelief.If you are looking for an action drama with a hero to save the day , look somewhere else . What you get here is heartbreaking reality ... .a glimpse of & quot ; Hell on Earth & quot ; , of wasted lives , of families being torn apart , and man 's incomprehensible inhumanity . This film could easily have been insufferable if it were n't for the thread of hope seeded in the birth of a bastard child . As a viewer , I grasped at this small ray of sunshine as I watched Quaid 's character slowly become more human . But if you are seeking a happy ending , this is n't your film either . Ultimately , you do have a sense of hope at the end , but it is fleeting at best . And maybe that is as it should be. & quot ; Savior & quot ; must have come and gone very quickly , because I never heard about the film before . That truly is a shame . While one has to be in a special mood to view this film , I promise you it will stick with you . Between 1 and 10 , & quot ; Savior & quot ; gets a solid 9 . It is truly unforgettable .	1
Great movie , but that 's not the point . I had to post this reply to make sure one thing is clear : Middle East is not Eastern Europe.And another thing : Bosnian Muslim fighters and Muhajadeenfighters are the same thing . Actually , if you look really close in the scene by the river you will see those are croatian soldiers ( most likely members of the Ustash militia ) . All the muslim fighters are calling themselves Muhajadeen , and that means ( if I remember well ) warrior in the name of Allah .	1
This was one of the most emotionally gripping movies I have ever seen ... this was a triumph for actor Dennis Quaid , a departure from his usual roles . Here he is the anti-hero , the guy whose pain and grief we understand but whose journey into darkness we shudder at ... . This is NOT a Serbian propaganda piece , as some have suggested . To the contrary , the first monster we meet in this story ( other than Quaid 's mercenary ) is a Serbian soldier who cuts off a Muslim grandmother 's finger to take her ring and talks casually about the Muslim women he has raped in prison camps . But the atrocities are not limited to the Serbs.We first encounter Quaid 's character , Joshua Rose , as a US military officer based in Paris . His wife and young son are killed in a bomb blast at a cafe opposite a US consular building . Rose 's rage and vengeance is immediately directed at the nearest mosque , where he goes in and starts shooting Muslim worshipers in the back . Several people [ have ] called these worshipers `` innocent , '' but that might be a misnomer because at least one of the Muslims drew his own handgun ... Anyway , Rose is encouraged by his friend ( played by Stellan Skarsgaard ) to flee arrest . They join the Foreign Legion , take on new identities and fight in wars in various countries . But Rose is just marking time . He wants a war he can believe in . This interlude was meant to show a passage of time and how long Rose has held onto his resentment , but it is too hurried to have that effect.Rose and his friend end up in the former Yugoslavia , fighting on the side of the Serbs . Rose is trained as a sniper and we see him waiting for targets with relentless patience . Anyone is a target ... His new partner is a Serb , hardened by war and without compassion . His partner 's brutality toward a young Serbian woman pregnant by a Muslim rapist ( like it was her fault ! ) finally causes Rose to intervene on behalf of someone.He takes her to her home but her family rejects her and even pursues them both to exact punishment from some twisted sense of honor . From then on it 's a desperate flight to get to a UN safe haven . Rose 's long dead compassion is aroused for the woman 's bastard child , and seeing him care for her baby awakens the mother out of her own numbness.Like others have said , this does not have a happy ending , but at least offers a glimmer of hope for souls to be redeemed and survivors to have a chance at life .	1
I did love this movie . I just am not certain why . Firstly , is Godrilla radio active or not ? The film begins with radio activity pinging off of the first ship Godzilla attacks ; again around the foot prints Nick is suppose to study ( let us not forget studying radio activity effects is Nick 's specialty ) . And yet once the army and Godzilla arrive in Manhattan , no more mention of radio activity . Why ? Well , if they carried forward the radio activity aspect , they could then locate Godzilla in Manhattan pronto ... .just look for the vast area of that island that is radio active , and bingo , you just found Godzilla . And what about Lucy ? ! First she tsk tsks Audrey for being a door mat by buying her boss 's groceries . Then tsk tsks Audrey for being too bold in asking about a promotion . Then praises her for being bold enough to steal a press pass . Lucy needs to make her mind up . Is Audrey a door mat or brazen self promoter ? And FINALLY ... why does the army colonel keep demanding Godzilla not be allowed to leave Manhattan . Why ? Does n't it seems obvious this destroyer of entire city blocks ; leveler of world famous skyscrapers , should be driven out to sea to destroy without risking the destruction of a city of three million people ? Sure it does . But , there you go again , no Manhattan to destroy , no movie in the first place . It would have been a good idea if the colonel had not mentioned blocking the big green guy 's escape . STILL..I ca n't help myself . I really did love this film . Oh , by the way . Does any one know if there are really enough fish in Manhattan to fill thirteen dump trucks in , say , just a few minutes ?	1
You can probably come up with negatives about this movie , but actually , for $ 4.99 with super saver shipping , this movie delivers pretty good entertainment . It 's worth it alone for the pier scene . I consider it a campy remake of the original , which is still the best , but at least the language and violence level are such that I can show it to my grandchildren .	1
Okay , I know this is going to be a highly disputed opinion , but I think this movie is very , very good . Great , I 'd even daresay . And I am a Godzilla fan . I love the Big Guy from his early masterworks to his campy mid-period to his new thrilling outings.Admittedly , this is not the same Godzilla . But Godzilla himself is a product of the 50s fascination with giant monsters , and this movie is really just an homage to all those old , great monster movies . Anyway , I do n't see why the universe is n't big enough for two Godzillas.A lot of fans hated this just for the idea . But Tristar had to make a new version . The old version would 've flopped in America . In fact , Godzilla 2000 came out about a year later , and it did terrible . So where were those so-called fans when he really needed them ? I submit that there really are n't that many Godzilla fans . There 's plenty of people who claim to be , but do they really like him or these types of films ? Does n't seem like it.Onto the movie . First there 's Godzilla . He 's a terrific special effect . Some people say he does n't look real . He looks pretty darn impressive to me . Realism is a rather silly complaint when you 're talking about a giant lizard running through New York.The story is deceptively simple . You could boil it down to Army vs. Monster , but there 's a creativity here that gets overlooked . The characters ( all of whom are well-developed especially considering none are the real star ) are all likable . Their motivations are believable . And their story arcs are solidly connected to the central conflict in a way that does n't seem forced.The action sequences are wonderful . I like to think of them as monstrous versions of great kung fu showdowns . Godzilla is n't invulnerable in this film , and so when he fights helicopters , rockets , and submarines , I actually felt suspense , even though I knew he was n't going down until the end of the movie.The plot of Godzilla 's young gives a nice excuse for some human-scaled action . The pacing is expertly handled . At two hours , there 's still a lot crammed in here . The acting is good . Jean Reno 's French military agent is beautifully understated . And the final end of Godzilla is both tragic and satisfying.I do n't love the last little bit , but to me it 's not so much an advertisement for a sequel as a wink to those `` THE END ? '' titles at the end of those great old movies.Boy , this is a long review . I guess I 'm just trying to make a case for this underrated and much-maligned film . Personally , I think the original Big Guy would love it . Although I 'm sure his version would end a little different .	1
I understand all the moaning about how the makers of this film ripped `` Alien '' off for one part of this film but , come on , Godzilla never looked better than he does here , even in Japanese films made years after this one . He no longer plods along , obviously a man in a clunky suit . He looks like a real , very believable dinosaur in this . My favorite scenes are those in which the old boy is chased by helicopters through the streets of New York . He steps on buildings , jumps through them and makes for a very realistic monster reeking havoc in a real modern metropolis . Those scenes are great ! I also thought the destruction of the Chryslar Building was really well done.It was fun to see two of the voice-over stars from `` The Simpsons '' as main characters as well.I suggest you get over being so picky and view the film as an overall picture , and a very entertaining one with great special effects ta boot !	1
This movie has been out for 15 years and people are still bashing this film ? Stop living in the past and move on , legendary 's godzilla should make you happy , so stop worrying about how bad Zilla is and focus on next years godzilla	1
I had ordered this for my son because he loves Godzilla . He loves the part where he 's at the elevator and met the little creatures , with a face expression that will just make you laugh into tears . I also want to say that it was fast shipping and the quality was excellent . Nice job amazon , I just love your website . I can find everything I need especially kindle books .	1
In light of the new 2014 Godzilla flick , i 'll do a side-by-side comparison.G 2014 : how much of the film is actually about Godzilla ? Maybe 17 % G 1998 : about 98 % G 2014 : in how much of the film do we actually SEE GODZILLA ? Maybe 15 % G 1998 : about 92 % G 2014 : GODZILLA personality : old , lumbering , annoyed , oblivious to humans - has one agenda : kill the `` MUTO 's '' G 1998 : GODZILLA personality : fast , intelligent , vengeful ( DOES take notice of humans , and goes after certain individuals ) - has an agenda : propagate his species , using New York City for a breeding ground.G 2014 : Human characters : bland , cookie-cutter people . Unremarkable and not memorable . Do n't care if they live or die.G 1998 : Human characters : likeable and memorable . If you get into this movie , you actually CARE what happens to them.G 2014 : story/dialogue : Very GRIM , with a capital G. Humorless . Typical of movies made in the last 10 years : ( with the delightful exception of PACIFIC RIM ) . I ca n't even remember how the movie ended , nor do I even care to go back to find out.G 1998 : story/dialogue : Clever , dramatic and funny ( in just the right places ) . TERRIFIC ENDING ! G 2014 : Special-effects : CGI overkill . Final `` climactic '' battle scene , which we 've all been waiting for , takes place at `` night '' , so what you can see does n't really add up to much . Major disappointment.G 1998 : Special effects : a combination of CGI , Animatronic and puppetry . Battle scenes are numerous and exciting . Part of the finale , in Madison Square Garden , has to be seen to be believed . Most importantly , the tag line `` SIZE DOES MATTER ! '' , can not be understated . The immensity and majesty of GODZILLA is excellently portrayed , both with the visuals and David Arnold 's superb score.Bottom line-why do I go to all this effort to compare these two films ? Because both films are American-made , and the 1998 Roland Emmerich film has been unjustly trashed , while this new bland entry is getting the accolades of critics everywhere . Personally I do n't get it , but we 're all entitled to our opinion.I would advise going out to see the new film , and then , if you have a copy of the 1998 film , watch it again-I think you 'll find it is better than you remembered , and find it far superior to this new entry . Just my opinion .	1
Some people are not going to appreciate this review . I knew a person that loved to eat liverwurst and jelly sandwiches and I thought he was kidding but he was n't and he ate it every day . Having said that I do n't know what it was about this movie but I loved it . I am not a big fan of Matthew Broderick but for some reason he just fit in like a glove . I thought the entire cast was a great mix and I believed them . I really thought some of the action scenes were just spectacular . Every time I watch it I enjoy it more and more . I have not seen the new 2014 Godzilla but many were disappointed . I do n't know , like my friend with his strange sandwich I just love this movie	1
the dvd I got was in good shape the disk was in good shape Godzilla is very good very dramatic	1
I 've had a black pair of Hawthornes for about 2 years until the heel is worn down so far it leaks . What this means is that I LOVE THESE BOOTS ! I 'm an architect and they were not unsuitable for office casual and I could tromp on out to a construction site on no notice , rinse off the mud afterward and go on with the day . As I said , I 've worn them down until they 're no longer watertight , which is a statement of how much I 've punished them . Now I need to replace them and all I can find is this Slime Green and Great White Hunter camouflage nonsense . BLACK !	1
I first watched this movie in theaters when it came out and I absolutely loved it . I guess I 'm different in that I never went into it with the intention or idea of comparing it to the original Godzilla . I knew it was a reinterpretation and I thought it was awesome . My 16 yr old son and I watched it recently on one of the cable movie channels and he was even more entertained by it than I , if that 's possible . If you look at this film that way instead of trying to compare it to the original you will see an exciting , action packed film that really is awe inspiring and terrifying . Yes , it does have its campy , funny moments ... they just have nothing to do with the monster . I honestly do n't understand why people did n't enjoy this film . My own sister , who 's just as big a Godzilla fan as I , did n't enjoy it . `` He 's not the original Godzilla ! ! '' No , he 's not . He 's bigger , faster , meaner ... better . I 'm gon na end up buying it .	1
Sorry ... When you got a theme of `` man vs. nature '' , nature always wins out . But , so is life . What else can you do when you 've got a raging lizard running around in NYC ? Could you try and get the National Guard and the Air Force to shoot it down ? Or do you get the Navy on board and shoot some torpedos at it ? Well , both were done , but none worked . Godzilla is too smart . Here is one `` monster '' that sprouted because of being exposed to nuclear testing , only to swim all the way from French Polynasia to Gotham , for the sole purpose of laying eggs . Just letting nature take it 's course . But in this tasteful movie , with the boyish charm of Matthew Broderick and the full gusto of a witty supporting cast , all of whom have the typical New York attitude , Godzilla finally gets what is coming to it . Man made it ; man destroys it . Or does it ? The ending leaves little doubt that there may be a nice sequel pending . I liked this movie . The special effects were first class ( I loved it when Godzilla was running down the Avenues of New York chased by army helicopters ! ) and the storyline -- -although it did have a undeveloped love interest story -- -was well paced and sequenced . All in all , good movie .	1
Good action picture . Godzilla is a cross between the old Godzilla andAlien . Enjoyed very much .	1
I do n't know why everyone was so negative towards this movie . I thought it was great . It was different from the original yes , but it was more faithful to the original than any of the others , plus it was action-packed with a great story , good performances , and great special effects . You 've got action , drama , horror , and comedy - everything a good Godzilla movie needs . Plus you 've got a more realistic and scary looking Godzilla in this film with state-of-the-art Hollywood special effects . The only thing that 's missing is Godzilla 's atomic fire breath and I would have also liked to have seen more Japanese references considering they were the creators of the movie monster . But other than that there 's not one bad thing to say about this picture.When Godzilla , a giant mutant dinosaur-like lizard , arrives in New York and rampages through the city , the military is called in to deal with the threat . But killing Godzilla will not be as easy as they expected . With a strong , intelligent , and determined creature , the human race will have to use all its might and intellect to defeat this menace . But they will have to hurry because Godzilla is about to lay dozens of eggs and soon the Big Apple will be overrun by many of these creatures - the ultimate creature and the most terrifying threat man has ever faced ! Highly Recommended !	1
I loved this move , than again i am not a fan of the original series of films but this one was my kind of flick.A Mutant Lizard is unleashed upon the world after it is mutated to ginormous size through nuclear radiation caused by French Weapon testing . When the lizard enters New York you can guess there are problems . Causing enourmous amounts of damage to the city the Military is fixed on destroying it . But it wont go away . The creature lays eggs in the Madison Square Garden Complex and now its spawn threaten to spead into the streets of New York.The main character played by Matthew Broderick is Dr. Nick Tatapoulus , a failing anthropologist who is contracted by the Government to find out what this thing is and where it came from . With the help of his Ex Girlfriend and The Men and Women of the US Army he sets out to stop the ultimate destruction.The film is a new take on the Classic story and is in my opinion better . The orginal Godzilla was an alien that procted earth by destroying buildings ? Sure he fights other giant monsters but thay cause less damage than he does . This film says he is a Mutated Lizard from the Galapagos Area and suggest the possibilty of Other Mutations .	1
Ok , the old Godzilla was good , but only because it was so bad ! The capy effects and cheezy storyplots were hilariouse , but you really only watch the movies to see the monsters wreck buildings and kick each other and send the other flying on a cable . Lets face it , they kinda lose steam by the time they get to ... .the second one . These movies dont really have any thought , they just make Godzilla vs. some guy over and over again . The movies make a profit because they only take like $ 200 to make ( exaggeration ) . But these movies are classics none the less and I still love them.But I also love the new Godzilla , half the people who hate this movie only do because the critics do . But lets get one thing strait right now , this is n't the old Godzilla movies , it was never intended to be . It is a modern day vision for the average American . The makers of this movie , Devlin and Emmerich , are good ( and Independance Day ruled , it had everything , there was absolutely nothing wrong with it , if you hated it , go watch some cheezy chick flick or something , geez even my mother loves this movie , I ca n't imagine how screwed up you must be ) . This movie is way more realistic then any of the old Godzilla movies were ( common , how many times can Godzilla happen to come by another giant monster , and the movies never follow up on each other ) even though this movie was pretty far fetched . Plus , this movie had MORE thought in it then the old ones , the old ones really did n't have much thought put into them , they were just thinkin & quot ; hey I have some extra bucks left over from the last godzilla movie , lets make another one , this time we 'll make him fight a giant moth & quot ; This movie had thrilling action scenes no matter what you think ( the old ones were more funny then thrilling ) , amazing effects ( no competition from original there , lol ) , the acting was good most of the time ( the old ones had terrible acting ) .So , I close by saying that this was never intended to follow in the old Godzilla 's foot steps , the old one was great because it was THE classic monster movie and follows a tradition of bad acting , storyplots [ which 50 % is an alien invasion and 95 % of the time monster ( s ) vs. monster ( s ) ] . This Godzilla is meant for everyone to enjoy ( lets face it , the old Godzilla had a small audience range ) and meant to compete with other modern day movies . Many people wo n't even give this movie a chance , but this movie simply rules !	1
Just like the movie `` Them ! '' that had an A-bomb in the desert create big ants , this one is the story of an A-bomb set off by the French creating a jumbo lizard.You know or can guess the story . The attraction for this movie is the new actors and ability to make new spooky situations as Dr. Niko Tatopoulos ( Matthew Broderick ) the worm doctor teams up with Philippe Roach & eacute ; ( Jean Reno ) the insurance agent , and Audrey Timmonds ( Maria Pitillo ) the worm doctor 's ex-girlfriend , team up to remove the threat before anyone finds out it is there And France was responsible . How are they doing ? One note : I did not know Gojira had a nick name until someone saw him and said `` Fire at Will . `` The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms	1
I am a huge fan of scfi fan and of godzilla.Sure it had some flaws like the way gino looked and that he was killed by six missles and ran away from helocopters.Overall a great movie .	1
While some disparage this Mather Broderick version I greatly enjoyed it . What really is not to like ; these are & # 34 ; popcorn & # 34 ; movies , NOT Shakespeare ! ! ! ! Godzilla himself -- - er , uh , & # 34 ; herself & # 34 ; ( you need to watch the movie to get this ) has been re-imaged from what we remember from the old Raymond Burr movie into a more believable fast mving bupedal creature.A great rainy day video romp ! .	1
This film gets a lot of heat from fans . I can understand why . It was a very entertaining monster film with the same concept as the original 1954 film , but with different monster origins and visuals .	1
This is really not so bad as people make out , its not a great movie no but its still fun to watch , you can look at this movie anyway you want depending on if you have watched any of the 28 Japanese movies , in terms of being cheesy this 98 version is no more cheesy in terms of acting , some of the earlier movies were more serious but the later ones had a lot of slapstick moments and in terms of effects its 50/50 some of the originals of course have great practical man in a suit effects and very cool miniature sets etc making them cult B movie monster movies which is what they try to capture , of course the new movie went with mostly CGI which in some ways is better as there is more things they can make him do , some of the effects in the originals are very questionable as its very poor looking tacky CGI , I personally think the creature in this version is very cool and still feels like an old school monster , this movie also sets the origin apart to go with something different making him more lizard but it works ok , certainly no more silly , the cast is questionable of course with a few Z list cast , but at the end of the day its still all good fun and that 's what its meant to be , if you have n't seen any original Godzilla movies then you may have a higher opinion of this movie when you do , in many ways I can understand the changes to bringing this franchise back but obviously they did n't work , this is no more cheesy or ridiculous compared to the stories of the past Japanese films , just enjoy it for what it is.Make sure you check out the 2014 version as it combines the best of both in my opinion , amazing looking monster that captures the essence of the original films with top notch CGI effects and large scale epic devastation and no cheese at all .	1
This is a brilliant story based on actual events that occurred in Turkey . The scary thing is that these events happen every single day . Brutal torture and barbaric brutalization of people in Turkey is a fact of life and this film does a fantastic job in dramatizing them.Amnesty International has well-documented cases of such violent acts committed against people that the govt . deems `` guilty '' of even the most minor offenses . Women are subject to rape and forcible vaginal examination at the hands of deranged policemen and young men are sodomized as punishment for their `` alleged '' crimes.Ignore the claims of racism made by pro-Turkish pundits that this film supposedly displays . This film is NOT racist . If the truth is racist , then let the truth be shown in its ' most brutal detail . What we see in the film are real , actual events that happen to both Turks and non-Turks in Turkey , every single day . While it 's true that Billy Hayes did not experience every single act of torture in this film , Oliver Stone and Alan Parker simply culled through the records of Amnesty International and gave voice to the countless victims of a brutal regime that has yet to this day to change its ' human rights record.This is a film that should be bought and watched periodically to remind ourselves of the kinds of depraved govts . that exist around the world and how they abuse human rights aimed at not only their own people but to Americans as well.The only things I wish were covered in the film was the real escape by Hayes and how he was helped by Greece and sent back to the U.S . The Greeks could very easily have sent Hayes back across the border to Turkey but in recognition of the cruel beating and rape that awaited him back in Turkey , the Greeks did the right thing and sent him home . Also , what happened to his friend `` Max '' , we are never told .	1
Jesus , this one got me thinking : do n't run drugs out of Turkey . Period , the End.This is a nasty , pig-blood ugly little flick : Alan Parker ( who also directed the equally moody , sultry , sweaty , stinky , and scary `` Angel Heart ) reaches deep into your cowardly heart and pulls out the true guts of fear : you 're young , you 're stupid , you 're American , and you 've really messed the hell up in a brutal , capricious , totally alien land . You 're in *their* System , baby , and that System brooks absolutely no tapdancing bullsh*t artists.So basically we sweep down into the wild , soon-to-be-arrested life of Billy Hayes ( the late great Brad Davis , who owns every second of his screen time and is completely astounding in this role ) , wildcatting young American , strapped up with premium Turkish hash , about to move it and shake it through customs at the Istanbul airport . Hey , man , chill : the dude needs the money.The problem is , he 's sweating like a dog . He 's with his girlfriend , who has zero clue : he 's all strapped up , ready to drop bombs he thinks , but he 's naive . And the Turks are onto him : they send out half their army to block him from hopping his plane , and the fun begins.Basically : he gets dragooned into Turkish police custody . He gets the baby-kissing treatment from the hapless US embassy guy : he gets hauled into court , he gets jibber-jabbered at by the Judge and Prosecutor . He has absolutely no clue of the deep sh*t he 's in . No fine rattling Camaros in the High Green American Summertime for Bill Hayes , no sirree.He gets life in a Turkish prison.The rest , really , should be for you to encounter ; Bill Hurt ( Max ) in all his decadent English goodness : Norbert Weisser ( Erich ) as the prison confidant ; the Great Peter Jeffrey as Ahmet , the Really Bad Machine ; and of course , the implacable , sadistic Paul Smith as prison Major Domo Hamidou , who has a fat kid and is a total monster.The film is bitter , and very much alive , very real : Brad Davis is even more astounding , in that he very much dissolves into his character , this modern day Montecristo who realizes that penance is just not enough , and seriously -- -when does Punishment itself become CrimeWhen it really comes down to it , you -- -Gentle Reader -- -have no idea how narrowly you walk on the right side of the Law . A little too much booze , a second behind the wheel , and you might find yourself in a tank , cuffed , frisked , strip-searched , gutted of dignity , deeply ashamed.But rejoice : at least you 're not in a Turkish prison.JSG	1
The only word I can think of to accurately describe this film . Midnight Express at its ' core is an expose not of the Turkish prison system but of the brutality that man is capable of . Based on true events , Midnight Express follows the life of American Billy Hayes , who is caught trying to smuggle a small amount of hashish on to his plane . Needless to say he is caught and sentenced to serve time in a Turkish prison . Billy endures endless torture both physical and mental during his tenure in the prison . There is one particularly beastly guard who looks like James Gandolfini from the Sopranos ; anyway this guard loves to whoop up on the prisoners , especially the Americans . The film takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions with plenty of twists and turns . The film score is nothing short of haunting . The use of sound and music in this film add a whole other level of horror to an already hellish situation . Some film buffs might also notice Randy Quaid in one of his earliest film roles as another American imprisoned with Billy . Overall , Midnight Express left me with a sick feeling . It challenges the viewer to endure countless acts of violence and brutality and yet still believe in the strength of the human spirit . A must own for any serious DVD collector . Highly Recommended .	1
Having read the book , I eventually had to see the film ( shot on location in Malta , just imagine trying to make it in Istanbul ! ) . If you know the history of the Turks and the Ottoman empire you will not be too shocked by any of it . But I have to say , the film brings it on home like few other documentary films do on any subject . Allowing for the usual conversion-to-film licence and editing/abbreviation , the story closely follows the factual and somewhat understated book.The extemely 'short nasty and brutish ' nature of man under these conditions comes over best in the film . The low regard of Islamic culture for individual rights is all too graphically depicted . The best way to fight this type of systematic cultural deceit and dehumanisation is with counter-deceit and careful planning . And making not losing your humanity in the dog-eat-dogness of the days a priority . He kept his hope alive by thinking of the 'Midnight Express ' -- the prison slang there for escape.The performances are riveting , the dialogue convincing , the action and pace just right . The fights are largely ludicrous and all the more real for that . The location is perfect.This film made a historical difference in that within days of its release and the shockwave it generated , the US and Turkey signed an extradition treaty to avoid US citizens having to suffer this type of degradation in the Turkish injustice system in future . So even a hashish smuggler can change history , even if he would not have done it if he thought it all through before taping the resin to his midriff . C'est la vie .	1
It still has it all . Great music , lots of drama and emotion too . Such a shame Brad Davis died so young he really was a talented actor . Billy 's pain and anguish has just as much impact as the first time I saw it .	1
`` Midnight Express '' is the upsetting true story of an American youth detained at Istanbul Airport trying to smuggle several packets of hashish ... This terrific movie based on Hayes ' book details the terrible story of his severe experience and final escape ... Brad Davis puts on view the frustration , anxiety and severe mental suffering of a tragic figure ... He stands shaking with fear in a small enclosed chamber ... At the court , Davis ' looks were lacking energy and interest ... His voice trembled with rage and affliction when he delivered a despairing frantic speech accusing the prosecuting attorney and the judge ... In a prison of desolation , he refuses to accept one captive 's advances ; he steals an informer 's money for revenge ; and gives a harsh lesson in brutality on one oppressor ... Paul Smith plays beautifully the brutal and sadistic head-guard ... Being of nature cruel and heartless , this bald man is vindictive and indifferent to the truth ... He is cruel , vicious , unjust , and verbally abusive ... The Turkish prison is seen as an environment so dirty , horrific and inhuman , clouded by rape , beatings , stress and punishment ... Parker permits the cruel prison guards -- characterized by their aggressive , cynical , and inflexible behavior -- to speak in Turkish since this situation can easily create hopelessness , frustration , hatred and despair ...	1
Candyman starts out pedestrian enough . Helen Lyle ( Virginia Madsen ) is a graduate student attempting to wow her instructor while dealing with her cheating professor husband . Helen chooses the local urban legend Candyman to blow her teacher away . Being the detailed and dedicated researcher , she investigates the area where most of Candyman 's victims are found ; the Cabrini Green housing project . Helen and her fellow student interview residents of the rundown apartment complex , explore an abandoned apartment that has been transformed into a shrine to the title character , and form an unusual bond with a young , struggling mother ( Vanessa Williams ) .All proceeds as one would expect until a murderer using the Candyman legend as a cover is caught by the police . Helen comforts a boy by telling him that the Candyman is not the boogeyman , just a bad man trying to scare and cause harm . This is the turning point of the movie.By destroying the boy 's belief in Candyman , Helen invites the entity who describes his state as `` to be but not to exist '' . Candyman is because others believe in him . Helen has destroyed this so he must now revive his legend and resuscitate belief in him . Helen encounters him in a parking garage where he commands her to `` be my victim '' . The next thing she knows , she is lying in the young mother 's apartment next to her dead dog with a bloody knife in her hand.From this point Helen descends into madness with murders and a kidnapping surrounding her while her husband 's cheating ways are revealed . Eventually Candyman asks Helen to join her in the non-existence of legend . To save a child , Helen agrees and sacrifices her life so the child might live . The worst thing about the movie is a rather cheesy ending that confirms Helen 's entry into Urban Legend-hood.Candyman is a well written thriller . It 's overabundance of gore overshadows the existential elements . All the actors perform their parts with aplomb . Virginia Madsen is more than believable as a woman on the edge of a breakdown , while Tony Todd was born to play the Candyman . His tall and imposing stature combined with a deep and creepy voice can be truly unnerving at times . Forgive the ending and you have a great horror film .	1
i can never watch this movie by myself.this is the scariest movie i have ever seen.candyman 's voice made me freak.i cant look straight into a mirror anymore.i still enjoy watching it and all , but not by myself.this is definetely the best horror film ever made.see it today	1
Eventually , anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories . First , you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter , and probing into the nature of evil . Sometimes , they go the supernatural route ( The Exorcist , Rosemary 's Baby , Do n't Look Now ) . Sometimes , they stay grounded ( Psycho , Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer , Se7en ) . Either way , they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening . You acknowledge that what you 've seen has struck a kind of nerve , but you wo n't lose much sleep . These movies are intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror.On the other hand , the second breed of quality horror movies has no interest in psychology , in the `` nature '' of their content , and do not attempt to intellectually engage you . They only want to make you feel as if you are in immediate danger . The movies that fall into this category ( Halloween , Alien ) do not provide food for thought , but they know how to make you uncomfortable , and they know how to push your buttons . They are manipulative in the extreme , but they are actively frightening , and provide visceral experiences that the previous category of horror films can not .Finally , the third category of superlative horror films distinguish themselves by remaining conscious of themselves . They want to frighten you , but they also want to convince you that they are `` above '' merely pushing your buttons . At the same time , they do n't want to go the intellectual route either . These films ( Scream , Dawn of the Dead ) are made by people who know the genre , know that the audience knows the genre , and toe a thin line between adhering to genre conventions and examining those conventions explicitly . These films are very effective , even if they are too cool for the room . You laugh knowingly , and then , bam , something truly frightening wipes that smirk right off your face.Bernard Rose 's `` Candyman '' is a rarity in that it falls into all three of these categories . It is intellectually stimulating and it knows a great deal about the nature of evil , but it is also , truly , viscerally frightening . It is self-aware and yet , it is not too cool for the room , and there is no comfortable distance to be found from the nightmare that unfolds on the screen . It is as immediately frightening as the orginal Halloween , it is as thought-provoking as The Exorcist , and it is as aware as itself as the Scream trilogy . You 've never seen anything quite like it before , and you probably wo n't see anything like it again.The plot of Candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine ; she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force ( the Cabrini Green Housing Projects in Chicago , which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation ) in search of discovering the source of the legend of the Candyman , a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times . She is convinced , as any liberal pseudo-sociologist might be , that the Candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang/drug-related violence . The fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the Candyman reinforces this conviction.For this woman , the idea that there is evil in the world , pure evil , unconditioned by economic/racial ( most of the residents of Cabrini Green are poor and black ) factors is unthinkable . She does not believe that the Candyman is anything more than an idea . She is wrong . The Candyman is real , and he does n't much like the challenge to his authority posed by her skepticism . Furthermore , she reminds him of someone from his past whom he wishes to be reunited with , and thus he comes to view her as a conquest on more levels than one.For about half of the film , we follow the woman , played by Virginia Madsen , and her friend , played by Kasi Lemmons , as they trek through Cabrini , exchange notes , and conduct the affairs of their lives . Madsen 's grad student is no different from a lot of young people . She is determined to make a mark on her field , she 's a little suspicious about her husband 's fidelity , she smokes , she 's pretty , she 's intelligent and she seems nice enough . She draws our sympathy.However , midway through the film , there is a decisive rupture , and everything in Madsen 's life begins to unravel at an alarming rate . The chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from . Soon , everything we have come to know about the young woman we 've been following , all of the connections she has to her friends , to her husband , to humanity in general seem to be undone . It would be unfair to describe exactly what happens , but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of Candyman are as frightening as anything I 've seen on film.We thought we were safe , after all . The character we 'd been following had friends , family , a job , a life of her own . The possibility of coming into conflict with nothing less than pure evil was the farthest thing from her mind ; she and her friend were more concerned about packing the requisite mace for their journey through the projects , more afraid of drug dealers than of demons . After all , the Candyman is an urban legend , and we know all about urban legends . They 're campfire stories . There is no Boogeyman , not really.Rose plays on the self-conscious approach we take to horror films by decisively arguing that it will not save us . He engages us intellectually by toying with the idea of whether the Candyman is literally real , or only becomes literally real if enough people are afraid of him ( I 'll leave that up to you to decide ) . And he frightens us at an immediate level by pulling the rug out from under us at a crucial moment , and by never allowing us to regain our footing . It does n't hurt that he has an uncanny eye for frightening visuals ( the bees swallowing the Chicago skyline , the Candyman 's self-portrait ) , plus the help of a terrific soundtrack from Philip Glass ( whose presence reminds us that , hey , this is a serious piece of art ) and compelling performances on all levels . Not to mention a great idea , and , yes , the ability to push our buttons and manipulate us when he wants to.Candyman is , as far as I 'm concerned , the second most frightening film ever made ; the original Halloween still remains the only movie that made me briefly fear for my own safety . But I would argue that the horror genre has produced no more complete work of art -- no other film that engages the viewer on every conceivable level they could ask to be engaged on -- than Rose 's masterpiece . Halloween becomes exponentially less scary with repeated viewings , as you begin to get the sequence down and figure out what 's coming . Candyman 's power remains undiminished , even once you get the sequence down , because the scares give way to the ideas.Do n't miss it.Rated R : Contains some very graphic gore ( nothing that will really surprise those used to the genre , but this movie does get pretty ugly by any standard -- seriously , who said this was n't gory enough ? ) some language , and brief nudity ( not in a sexual context ) .	1
Clive Barker 's intense , horrifying story is brought to life in stylish fashion , providing enough scares and gore for even extreme horror fans . However , blood and guts is not what makes & quot ; Candyman & quot ; such an impressive slasher flick . Virginia Madsen is excellent as a grad student researching the myth of a dead hooked slave who is haunting the slums of Chicago . Yet , when Madsen gets closer and closer to the truth , she realizes that she has gotten herself in a horrific mess that she may never escape from . Director Bernard Rose does a fine job of creating genuine suspense , while mixing it with some honest dialouge and an eerie musical score . Certainly one of the better slasher flicks of the early 90s . The ending is a shocker ! Director : Bernard Rose . Cast : Virginia Madsen , Tony Todd , Xander Berkeley , Kasi Lemmons , Vanessa L. Williams , Michael Culkin . Rated R for extreme violence , gore , profanity , and brief nudity . 98 minutes .	1
Clive Barker leaves one good horror series and starts another good one . Candy is a great horror movie with loads or gore and violence . The plot is good and we get to learn about Candyman and what he is like . This does deserve 5/5 stars , Tony Todd was terrific .	1
This really got me off . To this day this gives me the willies . The racism , homoerotic undertones , the real life ghetto of it , the disturbing nature of the title character- the acting to suspend your disbelief . Especially the mystery of Cabrini Green , what I heard was again a real life ghetto . The ending is probably the worst . A real life super mega low budget ghetto is the closest thing to a hell on earth . The sequel was even worse , exploring the character 's origins .	1
Candy man 5 times in the mirror and he appears & # 8230 ; Boo ! Tony Todd and his creepy voice Run ! lol good movie .	1
Based on Clive Barker 's short story & quot ; The Forbidden & quot ; ; Candyman is a surprisingly taut , scary , and refreshing horror film and one of the better horror films to come out of the 90 's . Believed to be an urban legend ( you say his name five times in front of a mirror and he is supposed to appear ) , a researcher ( Virginia Madsen ) soon learns that there is some truth to the legend when she investigates a murder . Director Bernard Rose manages to keep most of the violence off screen and keep the suspense mounting ( with the help of the excellent and chilling score by Philip Glass ) without the story lagging ( something many horror films of the early through late nineties had a problem doing ) and for the most part Candyman does justice to Barker 's story thanks to all I mentioned above plus the performances of Madsen and genre favorite Tony Todd as the hook handed killer . All in all , Candyman is a more than solid horror film that is definitely worth checking out .	1
I challenge you to watch this film and then stand in front of the mirror saying & quot ; Candyman & quot ; five times.Bet ya & quot ; chicken out & quot ; before reaching the last one.I know that I did !	1
Not just scary or disturbing , this is one of those films that , like `` Castle Freak '' , truly captures the word 'horror ' . Really I think fear ( or terror ) , shock , horror , and that subtler , more-lingering feeling we call 'disturbing ' are related but seperate senastions , and while many scary movies mix them in in different amounts , in `` Candyman '' the emphasis is definately on the Horror ( though shock is certainly present too ; see the film 's last ten minutes - one of the few unexpected finales not ruined by too many people giving it away one day after it hits theaters ) ( On a slightly digressive note , there are also quite a few movies in the horror section that , despite ranking relatively low in areas of actual horror or fear , still excel massively while maintaining their identities as horror films , drawing on spookiness , thrills , fun , awe , or whatever - `` Night Of The Demons '' and `` Cutting Class '' are 2 prime examples ) '' Candyman '' is about a graduate student ( excellently played by Virginia Madsen ) doing her doctoral thesis on urban legends , in particular the `` Candyman '' , a mythological figure said to appear when someone says his name in the mirror 5 times and , with his hook hand , split the victim - how does that go ? - 'from groin to gullett ' . Hoping both to explore the roots of how such legends get started and to debunk the legend herself , Helen ( the Madsen character ) ends up getting a lot more than she bargained for . It can be a harrowing watch - the nightmare Helen unleashes upon herself , the horrific partial origin of the tragic Candyman and why he does what he does - but it 's an excellent movie , with Oscar-worthy performances from Madsen and the always outstanding Tony Todd in the title role , though I suspect Oscar politics and Hollywood prejudices against graphic horror movies may prevent anyone in a movie like this from ever even being considered for a nomination , no matter how good they do.A tremendous horror movie , though the faint-hearted should approach with a grain of caution .	1
AS I HAVE WRITTEN IN OTHER HORROR MOVIE REVIEWS , CANDYMAN IS A WONDERFUL CLASSIC THAT GAVE ME MY FIRST NIGHTMARE IN YEARS . IT WASNT JUST THAT I WAS FRIGHTENED , THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE FOLKLORE/LEGEND GOT TO ME . I WAS YOUNG , IMPRESSIONABLE , AND OF COURSE SO VERY BRAVE . AT A SLEEP OVER , SOME FRIENDS AND I HAD RENTED THE MOVIE.RIGHT AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE , WE FELT THE NEED TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE OF OUR OWN BOREDOM AND SPK THE UNSPKABLE NAME FIVE TIMES IN THE MIRROR . OF COURSE GIGGLING TEENS THAT WE WERE IT TOOK A FEW TIMES TO BUILD UP THE INITIAL COURAGE , BUT ALAS WE DID IT ... AND NOTHING . BUT STILL THAT NIGHT IT LEFT ITS LASTING IMPRESSION ON ME AND MY YOUNG MIND , PRODUCING A MOST GRUESOME NIGHTMARE . MAYBE IT WAS OWN SUBCONCIOUS OR MAYBE THE LEGENDS TRUE WHO KNOWS , I JUST KNOW THAT FROM THAT DAY FORWARD I NEVER SPK HIS NAME ( CANDYMAN ) NOR HERS ( BLOODY MARY ) IN A JKING FASHION AGAIN . I JUST KNOW THAT CANDYMAN FREAKED ME OUT ... .AND THAT IS WHY IT DESERVES THE SHEER RESPECT OF HORROR CRITICS ALIKE***	1
*Minor spoilers*Wow . I honestly did n't expect much going into Candyman , but this was a really good movie . I generally like Clive Barker 's writing , but so many of his stories just do n't translate well to film . I 've never read the original story on this one , but I want to now . This was , simply put , wonderful.The plot follows a woman studying urban legends . One of which is the Candyman . Supposedly if you say his name five times into a mirror , he 'll come for you . Her investigation of the Candyman points to some grain of truth and she helps the police track down a real human culprit going by the name ... but that does n't stop the legend.The story is effective and I love the examination of urban legends and how belief is what keeps them going . The acting is good and the scares are pretty good too . The best part though is the score . Seriously , this has one of the best soundtracks I 've ever heard in a horror movie . It 's haunting and beautiful all at once . I really do not understand why this film is not as well loved and praised in the horror film canon . This is easily one of the best American horror films I 've ever seen .	1
A hook-handed killer tears people apart at a housing project Chicago , while graduate students researching urban mythology , become involved . This is one of the scariest movies . CANDYMAN is an intelligent , unconventional thriller . If you thought there were no original horror stories or just some predictable slasher movie , well you 're in for some surprises .	1
This is a really scary movie , thst 's well written , and acted . Although it creates excellent psychological tension , if definitly belongs to the horror genre.I did n't see this movie until I was married , I do n't know how I cold have missed it ! It takes place in the 90 's and I do n't feel the movie seems dated , now.A beutiful , intelligent grad student , Helen , is married to a professor , has a wonderfl apartment , sweet best friend and study partner , and is almost finished with her thesis , on Urband Legends . She hears the candyman tale , and investigates , and this is where the horror begins for both Helen and the audience.I would highly reccomend this to anyone who loves horror . Some people back away because , perhaps , they did n't like Helraiser , give this a chance , it 's a totally different story.I give it an A .	1
This is one of those movies that can stand alone in the Horror world . The tale of a son of a slave brutally murdered because he loved a white woman and he returns from the grave to extract revenge is pretty cool.The story itself revolves around a woman researching the myth for school . She does n't believe in it despite the fact that many people tell her it 's true . So she decides to chant his name 5x and from there her world spirals into a path of destruction and chaos.What 's cool is how effective Tony Todd plays the candyman . YOu almost feel sympathy for him but then he guts someone and you groan.HTis is a very cool movie that is a must see .	1
Just have to say that the movie is a really great classic ! Cool actors , great plot , no b.s . It 's just a movie that must be seen !	1
William Ragsdale , Roddy McDowall and Chris Sarandon starred in this hilarious film about the film star & quot ; Peter Vincent , The Great Vampire Killer & quot ; ( McDowall ) and his young fan Charlie ( Ragsdale ) and their fight to save Charlie 's girlfriend from a real life vampire , Jerry Dandridge ( Chris Sarandon ) . Peter Vincent is supposed to be the hero of countless & quot ; Hammer Film & quot ; type movies and the host of the evening television show , & quot ; Fright Night & quot ; . When Charlie goes to Peter to tell him the man who has moved in next door is a vampire , Peter naturally does n't believe him . Charlie persists and Peter finally goes to the vampire 's home with Charlie and his friends to prove to Charlie that Jerry Dandridge is not a vampire . While there , Peter accidentally learns that Jerry is the real thing . Although he is terrified , Peter ultimately comes through for Charlie and saves the day . A good comedy with some great special effects . . . it 's a keeper .	1
I just love `` Fright Night . '' This was the last film I saw at a drive in , and I went the next night also.I love scary movies with comedy , and great acting and production.This is a MUST have for you DVD collection .	1
Released in '85 ` Fright Night ' is a wonderfully campy , contemporary vampire tale that was one of the first films to bring the vampire mythos into contemporary times , preceding the classic ` The Lost Boys ' by two years . ` Fright Night ' is a bit uneven in the beginning but during the last thirty minutes or so the storyline really comes together and make it all worthwhile . Chris Sarandon makes a great vampire as is Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent , late night host of Fright Night , a weekly television show where he masquerades as a fearless vampire hunter.This one is lots of fun and stands up well to repeat viewings !	1
Alfred Hitchcock did n't die of old age - he shuffled off this mortal coil because the movies went to the teenagers . But if he 'd lived , and ever delved into the supernatural , he might easily have made this movie.Average high school kid Charlie has a debonair new neighbor , Mr. Dandridge , who seems to entertain a different knockout girl every night . Problem is , after they 've been to Dandridge 's house , the next place they 're seen is on the evening news - dead . As if that is n't bad enough , Charlie 's seen fangs in Dandridge 's smile , and Dandridge only comes out at night . Who can Charlie get to believe him ? His mother , friends , and the local police think he 's seen too many vampire movies . But Dandridge knows what Charlie 's seen . And he 's not about to let him go on talking about it.This is a great cat-and-mouse thriller , that just happens to be about a vampire instead of a mere serial killer . The script is clever , the performances good . Chris Sarandon is charming and menacing , in equal measure , as Dandridge . Roddy McDowall gets to play cowardly hero as the first person Charlie gets to believe him - a late-night horror movie host/has-been actor , who sets out to cure Charlie of his `` delusion '' and instead meets the devil next door . A pre-Married With Children adorable Amanda Bearse plays Charlie 's girlfriend.The effects are quite good , as are the atmosphere and musical score . The film 's only drawback is that it is sometimes directed with a heavy hand , and spends too much time on the juvenilia of Charlie and his friends - though the latter works to good effect , in the sense that it makes them very believable high schoolers , hardly up to facing the menace of an experienced and supernaturally powerful killer .	1
Not only is it the ultimate trip back to 1985 , but the cast could not be any more enjoyable and Fright Night winds up being a totally original , even at times creepy -- adolescent take on vampires . Chris Sarandon ignites the screen every time he shows up and Amanda Bearse could n't be any more charming . Shot in Panavision with Richard Edlund FX and a great new-wave soundtrack ( which is worth $ $ $ on eBay these days ) , this is not a cynical , sleazy teenage POS like we see in the 2000s ( e.g . Disturbia , which has a very similar plot ) .Watching Fright Night I was kind of reminded of another movie from 1985 -- Back to the Future . This was a transitional time from the huge Sci-Fi/Fantasy of the late-70s & early-80s into the more lighthearted and comedic turn a lot of genres were to take for a while . The big franchise sequels and superhero / TV adaptations were years away . Owing nothing to these conventions , Fright Night is a really smart script that understands a lot of its genre 's tricks and has fun with them .	1
If I had to list my top 100 favorite horror films , probably 80-85 would come from the 80 's . There was just something about that decade . Of course , I 'm a slasher fan , and this was their time . But it was a special decade , in general . Probably because it was the last decade when horror was not self-conscious . Since that time , everybody involved with horror feels the need to apologize , to mock themselves and their work . Everybody has to make sure you know that they 're in on the joke.It was n't always like that.In the 80 's , the studios would churn out sequel , after sequel , after sequel ... ... ... ..and all with a perfectly straight face . Although many people will not acknowledge this now , a lot of us-and this definitely includes me-would rather watch a rehashing of something we like , than to fork over hard-earned money to sit through something that may be less derivative , but is not nearly as much to our personal tastes.If they were still making Halloweens , and Friday the 13ths , and Howlings ... ... .I 'd still be there , for each one . In fact , I 'm really not sure why they have n't tried this . James Bond certainly made it work.Fright Night is a good example of what I 'm talking about . Of course , it 's not part of a series , but it is about a vampire . It DOES deal with tried-and-true horror motifs . And it does contain elements of parody , especially in dealing with the Peter Vincent character.But , even with its comedic content , it is never silly . It never mocks horror or the horror audience . Quite the opposite , in fact . There is a palpable affection for what it represents , and for the cinematic tradition within which it could be said to fall . Again , this is most heavily centered around the character of Peter Vincent . Watch his expression as he gazes at one of the props from one of his old movies ... ... ..he exudes a genuine sense of love , and nostalgia.That wistful , ethereal expression takes the film to another level for me . It is a look that has crossed my own features , time and again , through the years.I know it . It is love , although it is a kind of love that only a man of imagination would ever begin to be able to understand.There is really something profound about the Vincent character . He initially appears to be a fraud and a coward . However , as the film progresses , he becomes more and more the man he had heretofore only PRETENDED to be , in films . There is something to be said for the notion that it is unlikely that a person will be generous , or brave , or honest , or much of anything noble ... ... ..unless they have first ASPIRED to those traits . And Vincent , against all odds , eventually BECOMES what he had always wanted to be.My only real criticism of Fright Night lies in the casting of the girlfriend . I forget her name , but it was Marcie , off Married With Children . No offense , but it 's kind of hard for me to imagine that she could foster this kind of obsession from ANY man , much less a guy as smooth and handsome as the vampire . As for the villain himself , he was just about ideal . Handsome , urbane , charming ... ... ... but able to exude something dangerous and mysterious , as well . Charlie was supposed to be an average teenaged boy , and that 's pretty much the way he came across.This is not my favorite , by any means . I 'm not really much of a vampire person . But it 's quite good , and a quality film , all the way around . It has a sincerity that you wo n't often find after the 80 's came to a close . And an affection for its genre that I 'm afraid you will seldom find ANYWHERE nowadays .	1
When i was little , this movie had my scared and laughing at the same time . You got ta see this one . Make sure you have popcorn .	1
I was 15 when this came out and it was during that time when slashers were no longer in vogue and Hollywood started doing these inane and insulting horror-comedy hybrids.. This was one of the better ones and it worked well..It 's also interesting to note the scenes with Amanda Bearse acting sexually frigid seems interesting now , considering she came out 10 years later.. and due to a sagging mainstream career after 976 Evil ( 1989 ) , Stephen Geoffreys hit the gym and switched to making hardcore gay xxx porn ( after he came out ) .. Now where 's the E ! True Hollywood Story on this one ? ? Anyway , Fright Night is a good 80 's flick ... the sequel , not so great..I purchased the DVD back in 2006 , when Sony had updated and remastered it in High Def ... It does n't look half bad on my Blu Ray , and it 's sold , here , on Amazon , for like $ 10.00..NEW . Yes , I know , it only has the Original Theatrical Trailer , and it 's `` JUST '' in Dolby surround sound ( for you perfectionists ) .. BUT I do n't care , 'cause I 'm not paying $ 350+ for ANY movie . Especially one still readily available on DVD.. ( Twilight Ltd Edition '' numbered '' Blu Ray ) . I pitty da fool who buys it for that price . Ha !	1
What would you do if a vampire moved in next door ? That 's the question this movies asks as young Charlie Brewster gains a most unwelcome neighbor at the beginning of the movie . Charlie is n't the smartest guy in the world but he does figure out that a vampire has moved next door and immediately tries his best to tell others about him ... a strategy that is obviously doomed to failure since no one will believe a hysterical teen yelling that a vampire next door is killing people . Without giving away any more of the plot , most of the rest of the movie involves Charlie and his friends trying to survive long enough to kill their new nemesis.One of the great things about this movie is that it is n't trying to add some weird twist to the idea of vampire movies . It is n't a comedy ( Love at First Bite ) , a grand drama ( Interview with the Vampire ) , an action movie ( Vampires ) , etc . It 's a suspenseful vampire movie . Period . That sounds like such a simple idea , yet I 've rarely seen any other vampire film actually pull it off like this one . We meet a small group of fairly interesting people , they 're put in danger , and we spend the rest of the film on the edge of our seats hoping they get out alive.Finally , this movie is worth watching just to see Roddy McDowall 's performance . The entire cast does a great job , but McDowall really stands out as he plays a washed up actor . A small and frightened man , he is forced to confront extreme terrors or die . McDowall is so expressive and believable that the movie gains a depth that another actor might well have failed to deliver.If you 're a vampire fan tired of seeing bad film after bad film then cheer up , this one will make your day for sure !	1
Now for my 2012 horror thon if you want to call it that is the original Fright Night released in 1985 made on a budget of $ 9 million made $ 24 million . Directed by Tom Holland he directed Childs Play & Thinner . Stars Chris Sarandon as Jerry Danderidge , William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster , Amanda Bearse as Amy Peterson , Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent .

So later on he is talking to Amy at this burger joint casue their realtionship is n't working out & they do n't give each other the attention they deserve . On The TV they announce they found the body of this woman It 's the body of the same woman he saw earlier in the day .

He goes outside hides in the bush 's & sees what is going on . Billy puts a bag in The Jeep Jerry fly 's down as a bat . You have Jerry take an apple & starts eating it . It 's just the arrogance of how he does it I know he 's the villain but he ' sort of a cool villain unlike Colin Farrelle who looked like a dork straight out of Twlight trying to play Jerry Dandridge . Charley tries to convince his Mom & his Girlfirend that Jerry Dandridge is a Vampire.He goes to The Police & he has a cop check out the house . Nothing checks ot but Charley happens to find a painting in the house that looks like Amy . Charley goes to his friend `` Evil Ed '' who tells him he needs to get a cross some garlic & Holy Water . At his house his Mom tells him that there is a visitor Jerry & Charley is scared to death . Again Chris Sarandon just plays it so cool & arrogant . He says `` Afrid I 'd never come over without being invited 1st ? You 're right you 're quite right . Of course now that I 've been welcome I 'll probably drop by quite a bit . In fact ant time I feel like it . With your mother 's kind permission of course . '' So later on that night Jerry is in the house hiding in Charley 's closet he grabs Charley starts tossing him around chocking him you believe that Jerry wants to kill Charley . He tries to throw Charley out a window Charley takes a pencil stabs him in the hand then Jerry turns into Vampire form you get some very good make up effects . Charley 's Mom wakes up this was the only problem I had was with all that racket going on it took her so long to wake up & she does n't ask why his room is such a mess only that it 's a nightmare anyway Jerry fly 's off . Charley figures out that he needs the help of Peter Vincent who hosts a show called Fright Night that he is a fan of . He goes to talk with him the next day he tells Charley that the show was canceled he tells Charley `` Apparnetly all kids your age want to see are demented madmen in ski masks hacking up young v i r g in s. '' Charley tells him that he believes in Vampire 's like he does . He tries to convince him to help him but he does n't want to . Amy & `` Evil Ed '' go to Peter Vincent . Amy pays him $ 500 from her savings account to help prove that Jerry is a Vampire . They all go to his house & Peter does n't use Holy Water just tap water & when Charley pulls out a cross Peter Vincent stops him cause he 's just doing it for the money . When Peter Vincent pulls out a pocket mirror & they are all behind him except no Jerry in the reflection . He drops the mirror & piece of glass is left behind . Jerry is out to hunt them down . In an alley Jerry goes after Evil Ed & bites him turns him into a Vampire . Jerry chases affter Charley & Amy & Tom Holland shows off his directing skills where Jerry is following them . They are chased into this club called Club Radio . Charley tries to contact Peter Vincent he refuses . Jerry puts Amy under a trance this part is well directed like when Jerry has Amy & they are dancing when they are in front of the mirror no reflection of Jerry & the trance is broken & when he turns her away from the mirro she is back under his power . Charley tries to stop him & he tries to punch himk but Jerry grabs his fist & tells him if you want Amy back bring me Peter Vincent . Charley yells at Jerry to let her go security gaurds stop Jerry . They get pwnd . As the people run out of there Jerry takes off with Amy . Evil Ed who is now a vampire tries to kill Peter Vincent he places a cross on his forhead which burns his forhead & he fly 's out of there . Charley finally gets Peter Vincnet help they go into the house . You have Peter Vincent confront Jerry Dandrige he tells Peter Vincent that the cross wo n't work cause he does n't believe . Billy knocks Charley over the banister . Peter Vincent rins over to Charley 's house to warn his mom but Evil Ed is in her bed cause his mom is gone to work the way Stephen Geoffrey 's plays it over the top is great . `` Well apparently she 's woking nights . But she left a note . MMMMMMMM ! His dinner is in the oven ! '' Peter runs off & is attacked by Evil Ed who has turned into a Ware Wolf Peter takes a leg off the table & uses it as a stake stabs him in the chest & the effects where he turns back & dies are great . Charley has been put in a room where Amy is at Jerry has bit Amy & is turning into a Vampire cause Amy looks like a lost of Jerry 's & when William Ragsdale tears up he just sells it & I buy him more any day of the week than Anton Yelchin . Peter returns he tells Charley that if we kill Jerry she will be turned back . Billy confronts them they believe he is human Peter fires a gun that does n't work Charley takes a stake puts it in Billy 's chest the effects where that dudes skin melts off is great . Then you have a great finish with Charley & Peter Vincenent trying to kill Jerry Dandrige . Peter takes a cross & Jerry backs up in front of a window Peter says your time is up . He turns into a bat attacks Peter . The incoming sunlight burns Peter so he flees to the basement . They go down after him Peter tries to bust a lock on the coffin that Jerry is in . You have Amy come in who is now a Vampire & is kind of hot now . She tells Charley do n't you want me anymore she tries to she tires to bite him he uses a cross to weaken her . She says `` It 's not my fault Charley . You promised me you would n't let him get me ! '' She transforms into her Vampire form goes after Charley . Peter opens the coffin tries to hammer a stake into Jerry 's heart he takes it & throws it at the wall which cracks open & sunlight comes in . Charley tries to keep from killing Amy which is a great plot point it proves hwo much he loves her & I buy it . Charley & Peter keep busting windows open to allow more & more sunlight to come in . Which is burning Jerry . He tries to get back to his coffin Peter slams the lid Charley removes the window blinds which Jerry Dandridge is then killed in a great effect . Charley goes to protect Amy from the rays & she is turned back to normal they hug & that 's pretty much the movie . If I did n't do a good job explaining the plot in my retrospective then I 'm sorry . Fright Night is an excellent Vampire movie a cast that clicks well great effects awesome score by Brad Fidel . A script that had a brain to it . Tom Holland did a great job directing . Chris Sarandon was great . William Ragsdale was very good . Roddy McDowall was good . Amanda Bearse was good . Stephen Geofferys did a pretty good job . Jonathon Stark did a good job . Dorthy Fielding was ok . It is shame that this movie never got a special edition there is a Blu Ray but what is the features an isolated score & a booklet & The Blu Ray is way to expesnive . Where si a documentry & a commentary . Maybe Shout Factory needs to get on it . If you have never seen Fright Night from 1985 you 're missing out . Next I will review Fright Night II .	1
I love this movie . It is a great movie . Unfortunately $ 200 for a Blu Ray disc . Someone has to be on drugs to pay so . Amazon should not allow items over price like this one been posted .	1
FRIGHT NIGHT ( USA - 1985 ) Aspect ratio : 2.39:1 ( Panavision ) Theatrical soundtrack : Dolby StereoUnable to convince anyone that his new neighbor ( Chris Sarandon ) is a vampire , a desperate teenager ( William Ragsdale ) summons the help of a reluctant TV 'horror host ' ( Roddy McDowall ) to confront the monsters in their midst ... Produced at a time when the American horror film seemed to have lost its way following the glut of low-budget independent shockers which proliferated in the wake of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13th , Tom Holland 's FRIGHT NIGHT attempts to straddle the gap between 'traditional ' horror and the effects-driven blockbusters which had begun to dominate genre movies in the early 1980 's . The plot is a little thin , and there 's a couple of items which date the narrative squarely within its decade ( notably the disco sequence , and a cringe-inducing theme song by the 'J . Geils Band ' during the closing credits ! ) , but Holland 's script reserves its major fireworks for a dramatic second half , in which the forces of Good and Evil make their final stand against one another , resulting in a barrage of monsters and mayhem , courtesy of Richard Edlund 's superb visual effects.Ragsdale and love interest Amanda Bearse are saddled with stock juvenile characters , but Sarandon relishes his role as the vampiric predator , toying with Ragsdale as the boy 's accusations of supernatural horror are met with incredulity by all around him . However , McDowall steals the movie as a faded horror star whose old-fashioned values have fallen out of favor in an increasingly cynical age , and who finds himself confronted at the end of his career by very real monsters indeed . Though somewhat underwritten , McDowall portrays the man 's cowardice , sadness and ultimate redemption with a deftness and clarity that brightens the entire movie.Some observers have discerned a homoerotic subtext in Ragsdale 's obsession with his handsome , vampiric neighbor , and also in Sarandon 's pursuit of Ragsdale 's high school buddy ( Stephen Geoffreys , also known as 'Sam Ritter ' , star of gay adult movies like VIRTUAL STUD and SEX ON THE BEACH ) , and while there 's some merit in this particular reading , it does n't get in the way of the slam-bang melodramatics . Geoffreys adopts a range of tics and mannerisms which will infuriate some viewers and endear him to others , but his final sequence - one of the best in the entire movie - is charged with genuine emotion ( rendered even moreso by McDowall 's extraordinary , wordless performance on the sidelines ) , and the 'death rattle ' which accompanies Geoffreys ' departure is one of the creepiest sound effects this reviewer has EVER heard ! ! ... Followed by FRIGHT NIGHT PART 2 ( 1988 ) .	1
This film won a Saturn Award , received a sequel and got a remake ( and it looks like a direct-to-video sequel for the remake is in the works ) . My only complaint is that the extras are light on this DVD . A deluxe Blu-ray with 3 hours of bonus content would be a worthy addition to your library . Fright Night is stuck on DVD for now . It was released on Blu-ray by Twilight Time but went out of print Dec/2011 . It does have a multi-region Blu-ray that can be imported .	1
I was n't in the right mood when I saw this , so it took a long time for me to think 'urbane parody ' instead of 'why is Charley Brewster ( William Ragsdale ) such a screw-up . ' Most of this was due to a start that got most of its laughs from scenes of Charley ignoring his girlfriend Amy ( Amanda Bearse ) to spy on Jerry Dandridge ( Chris Sarandon ) , the vampire who has moved in next door . The sight gags simply do n't work very well and until the film actually develops some dialog it does n't really shift from 'yet another clich ' ridden horror film with a big cast ' to 'Hey ! That was cool . 'So Charley discovers that Dandridge is lunching on the local joy girls while Billy Cole ( Jonathan Stark ) the ghoul redecorates the nest by painting the windows black . Charley attempts to raise the alarm , but only manages to convince everyone that he is having a lot of 'teenage ' moments . In desperation , he turns to the local horror show host Roger Vincent ( Roddy McDowell ) and suddenly the film shifts into high gear . He gives a one-man demonstration of the acting abilities that have put him in some 250 films , playing a crotchety ex-actor whose nickname was 'The Vampire Slayer , ' now reduced to a late nite host with slipping ratings.McDowell plays the part as frightened man who knows that vampires really do n't exist and then discovers that they do . He squeezes every bit of humor there is to be had out of the part and somehow gets everyone else up to his level . Just when you think the film is in danger of failing in spite of Sarandon 's coolness , McDowell demonstrates that there is still a lot of life in those old clich 's . Fright Night ca n't help being light weight , but it does manage to be successfully entertaining . And you get some interesting special effects when people go vampy face or dissolve upon staking .	1
Young Charley Brewster discovers that a murderous vampire has moved in next door , but his mom , his girlfriend Amy , and his kooky friend Evil Ed do n't believe him . To convince Charley that he is in error , Amy and Evil Ed hire the late-night TV horror host , Peter Vincent , to subject the purported vampire to & quot ; the test. & quot ; But once the motley troupe enter the vampire 's lair , the FRIGHT NIGHT truly begins.Despite a predominately youthful cast , this is definitely not the average cookie-cutter teen horror flick . Writer-Director Tom Holland 's boy-who-cried-wolf script is both humorous and scary , and he has ingeniously employed all the typical conventions of the vampire sub-genre in fresh and interesting ways that sidestep the cliche . This , combined with outstanding special effects and top-notch performances , helps rank FRIGHT NIGHT among the cinematic vampire classics.The acting is excellent . The three younger principals-William Ragsdale as Charley , Amanda Bearse as Amy , and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed-all deliver their roles with an honesty few young actors can achieve , and they are therefore quite convincing as teenagers facing a horrific situation . But it is Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowall that truly carry the film . As the vampire neighbor Jerry Dandrige , Sarandon is at times flippant and at other times downright terrifying . He knows just when to play it straight and when to be a ham , and he never misses a beat . And veteran thespian Roddy McDowall is perfectly cast as ersatz vampire hunter Peter Vincent . He handles his character 's shift from Shakespearean bravado to whimpering cowardice ( and back ! ) so deftly that his performance is nothing less than a sheer joy to watch.The bulk of the special effects , and therefore the biggest shocks , come during the last third of the film . But that does n't mean that the first part of the film is n't scary . Even in the lighter moments , Writer-Director Holland maintains a spooky atmosphere throughout , and he is helped in this by Sarandon 's smarmy vampirish charm and by Ragsdale 's convincing depiction of a young man spiraling into the pit of abject fear.The DVD version of FRIGHT NIGHT does n't have a lot of extras , but it 's still well worth the cost . To quote the trailer : & quot ; If you love being scared , this could be the night of your life ! & quot ;	1
One of the few mainstream horror films from the 80 's that is still great to this day is the original Fright Night . Helmed by Tom Holland ( who would go on to direct the original Child 's Play ) , Fright Night contains all the familiar elements and conventions of the vampire film genre , but thanks to Holland 's energetic direction , great cast work , and some great ( mostly ) makeup effects , Fright Night succeeds where most others fail , and is a fun horror classic . William Ragsdale stars as Charley , a horror loving teen who suspects his new neighbor ( Chris Sarandon ) is a vampire . Soon enough , Charley 's suspicians prove true , and with the help of an eccentric B-horror movie actor ( Roddy McDowell ) , he sets out to stop the powerful vamp as his family , friends , and girlfriend ( Married ... With Children 's Amanda Bearse ) are threatened . With tried but true conventions and everything else mentioned above , Fright Night may not be the best vampire movie you 'll ever see , but it 's certainly one of the most fun .	1
The actor and actresses in This version of Fright night are more realistic , more frightening , more sexy , less forgettable than the new one that came out more recently . Been looking for this version for awhile .	1
While the film is not particularly frightening , it is well done and should please most who enjoy a decent tale of the undead.The story centers around a high school student who discovers that a vampire and his personal aide have moved in the house next door . A series of murders leads the lad to initially investigate the goings-on himself , then later seek the assistance of his friends , then finally Peter Vincent ( Roddy McDowel ) , fearless vampire killer -- hero and host of a local television show . One thing leads to another and eventually the vampire is killed -- the neighborhood saved . ( ho-hum *yawn* ) The film is humorous at times but the effects are well done and the story is about as unique as can be accomplished with a vampire tale . The DVD is clean and clear . & quot ; Fright Night 2 & quot ; , an even better movie with the same general theme ( our hero is now in college ) , has not yet made the DVD scene ; but when it does you 'll surely want to add it to your collection if you enjoy this one.Light enjoyment . Not suitable for younger children . Some minor but tasteful nudity . *Recommended* ~P~	1
A fun movie all around . The special effects were great and effective . Still a suprise after all these years . The story I thought was excellent . Roddy Mcdowell turned in a great performance , as always . The only thing that bothered me was the powder white hair , and the gastly white make-up they gave Roddy , could have been better . If you have a vampire collection add this movie , you will not be disappointed .	1
I 've loved this movie since I was a youngin . It has a lot of cheesy jokes , and cheesy effects , but its still a good movie . Not the best movie ever , but def . worth the watch . Much better then the remake , I think .	1
It 's about time Dracula had a modern makeover , and this film does it with style . Parts of the story are fun and campy , but it 's serious and scary enough for me . Dracula is suave and seductive ; one could imagine wanting to be bitten by him , and there 's a surprisingly erotic scene in a disco of all places . Roddy McDowall plays the part of a late-night television horror film emcee , and he adds a nice touch as he haplessly helps his young friends defeat Dracula with his `` vampire kit . '' This is a good film to sink your teeth into .	1
Great movie ... I met Gene Hackman , in Santa Fe , when the filming was happening , on this one . He is a great actor and the film was very accurate and enjoyable to watch ... thanks .	1
Matt Damon is the narrator and constant presence in this great story , based on the real-life first person account of Britton Davis . But he does n't even rate a mention on the front of the DVD , and you have to look carefully on the back to seem him mentioned at all . To top it off , even the Amazon.com `` Editorial Review '' shown above gets it wrong . What gives ? Not that he is necessarily the greatest presence of this exemplary ensemble ; I was highly impressed with all of them , and even remarked to my wife that Jason Patric must be a fine horseman before learning that he did all the stunts himself.The story and scenery are all first rate too . The next time you get out to Moab , Utah you can check out the spectacular locations ( near or maybe in Canyonlands National Park for some of them ) . But the final scene is the most moving and visually impressive of any movie I have ever seen . It is worth the price of the DVD all by itself .	1
A very good historial movie . It has the Indians side of the story , which is refreshing to see . A great action movie that will hold your attention .	1
Geronimo : An American Legend has gone mostly under the radar since its release in 1993 , but it 's an above average historical movie that tries to show the truth in history instead of how movies usually portray it . In the 1880s , the U.S. Cavalry persuades Apache chief Geronimo to surrender and live on the reservation at Turkey Creek . But with a new life forced on him , Geronimo is uncomfortable and when a medicine man is shot down for inciting the tribe , the chief leaves the reservation with a band of warriors . The cavalry must now get back in the field , patroling the Southwest in hopes of catching the renegade chief . Like many good westerns , this movie deals with the changing times and how individuals dealt with those changes . We are shown both perspectives , the cavalry and Geronimo , so it 's a balanced movie overall . It 's not an action movie although the battle scenes are well-done , instead it 's more of a character study of all the participants as the cavalry tries to bring Geronimo in to live on the reservation . An underrated , very well-done movie.Leading an impressive ensemble cast , Jason Patric plays Lt. Charles Gatewood , a cavalry officer who respects the Apaches even as he fights them . It is this respect that leads to a friendship with Geronimo . Patric plays the part well as an officer who feels conflicted with what he 's been ordered to do . Gene Hackman gives support as General George Crook , the commander of the cavalry forced to capture the Apache chief . Not a huge part for Hackman , but still a really good one . Robert Duvall almost steals the movie as Al Sieber , the veteran scout who 's come to despise the Apaches even though he sees many similarities between them and himself . Wes Studi is excellent as Geronimo , the Apache chief who struggles to change with the times as the cavalry moves ever closer to catching him . And in one of his first movies , a young Matt Damon plays 2nd Lt. Britton Davis , an inexperienced officer who gains that experience on the Geronimo campaign . Those five leads share the screentime and carry the movie . The excellent supporting cast includes Steve Reevis as Chato , an Apache scout for the cavalry , Rodney Grant as Mangas , a close friend of Geronimo , and Kevin Tighe as General Nelson Miles . All around a very solid cast.The DVD unfortunately is somewhat disappointing although the price is low . The movie is available only in pan-n-scan , not widescreen , which is a shame because director Walter Hill really has a beautiful movie here , filmed in Utah and Arizona . Only special feature is a trailer . But bad DVD or not , it 's an excellent movie that benefits from a great cast and showing both sides of the story . Give Geronimo : An American Legend a try !	1
The best all around movie . All very good acting from all ... . And a good story to go with ... . Emma Thomson at her best and award winner at that ... Everything is just A++++++++++.I love it ... .	1
The film is wonderful and the Blu-ray transfer is fantastic . It 's a clean image with oodles of detail and beautiful , natural colors . The only thing I did n't like so much is that the musical score is quite bright at times , which is disappointing being that I love the score . I do n't know if that is due to the way it was originally mixed or if that is Criterion 's fault . The audio mix in general is decent considering it 's a low budget period drama . This is certainly the best presentation of Howard 's End that I 've ever experienced .	1
The filmmaking duo of Merchant-Ivory score yet again with this wonderful rendition of the E. M. Forster novel . There are many ideas that flow smoothly throughout the film : how fate has a way of catching up ; how what is meant to be will be ; how one can pay for the consequences of one 's acts in totally unimagined ways . But beyond being a thought provoking film , this film also succeeds at every level as just a film . The absolute top acting talent is used for every role , with Emma Thompson deservedly winning the Oscar for hers . Anthony Hopkins renders the British capitalist of this time period flawlessly . His best line is , & quot ; The poor are poor because they are and there you have it. & quot ; This is said in dismissing the plight of a young man to whom he gave the wrong advice . The opening scenes with Vanessa Redgrave and Emma Thompson showcase two different generations of English acting powerhouses on stage and screen . They are a delight to watch together . The costumes are out of this world and were obviously well researched and made to conform to every detail of the period . The same is done with the settings both in London and the country so that you feel as if you are back in that era yourself .	1
The feeling that has overwhelmed me at the end of HOWARDS END is disillusion . This movie convinces you that dreams never come true and that humans are incredibly gifted to destroy the little parcels of happiness that life can provide to some of them . James Ivory 's treatment of the novel of Forster is a model of the genre , the psychology of the characters is so well depicted that you are able to guess what thoughts cross their minds when they do n't talk.HOWARDS END is the picture of a world that collapses , the world of the european XIXth century , a period during which the intellectuals have for a moment believed that their ideals would change the future of this continent . But industrial progress and colonialism have killed their hope and as says Anthony Hopkins in this movie : & quot ; Poor will stay poor . It 's sad but it 's like that & quot ; .So HOWARDS END analyzes the reactions of a small group of people facing this situation ; some of them wo n't care , the others will be intimately marked for the rest of their lives . Only Howards End , the house where all the dramas begin and end , will stay untouched . For how long ? Performances to be remembered from the entire cast . Three trailers ( Howards End , Sense and Sensibility and another James Ivory 's classic , the remains of the day ) . Some problems with video and audio now and then.A DVD for your library .	1
Intriguing , involved story , fantastic acting , not fairy-tale-ish , even a bit dark . But very believable . I enjoyed it , especially being both a Hopkins and a Thompson fan . Ca n't say it 's my favorite movie ever , but I loved it .	1
Ismail Merchant and James Ivory will probably be best remembered for their gorgeous productions of E.M. Forster novels , of which 'Howard 's End ' is second to none . How can one fail , given their winning formula of lush period settings , perfect musical accompaniment , and flawless matching of character to actor ? This particular Merchant/Ivory film was nominated for countless awards , including nine Academy Awards , among them Best Picture , Best Director , and Best Actress.The story revolves around the Schlegel sisters , Margaret and Helen , and their involvement with various characters including a ruthless businessman and his dying wife , and a down-on-his-luck day clerk . Margaret is the sensible sister , caring but careful , while Helen is the idealist , out to save the world , without realising how condescending she can be in attempting to do so . Their brother is almost an afterthought in the story . Margaret is portrayed by Emma Thompson , veteran Shakespearean and British actress ; Helen is played by Merchant-Ivory veteran Helena Bonham Carter . Other players include Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins , James Wilby ( also in other Merchant-Ivory productions ) , Samuel West , and the great Vanessa Redgrave . ( Look for Prunella Scales , best known as Sybil Fawlty from 'Fawlty Towers ' in what might be described as an extended cameo role . ) The characters show some of the principal social class divisions of late Victorian/Edwardian England . The Wilcoxes are a successful business family , unlettered and conservative ; the Schlegels are genteel aristocrats with an idealistic bent but slowly declining economic fortunes ; the Basts are underprivileged but yearning for more . One of the better lines comes from the aunt of the Schlegel sisters , as she explains their upbringing : 'Of course , they are British to the backbone , but their father is German , which is why they care for literature and art . ' This is a world in which everyone expects to have a discernable and well defined role , but the world around these social classes is changing rapidly.At first , Helen is engaged to the younger Wilcox son . In short order , this relationship breaks , but not before the Wilcoxes and the Schlegels are intertwined in continuing social encounters . Eventually , the elder Schlegel sister Margaret gets a marriage proposal from the patriarch Wilcox , after his wife dies of a long illness . Helen has , in the meanwhile , become pregnant from the underprivileged Leonard Bast , whose wife , we discover , had a brief fling with the elder Wilcox in the past . If this sounds like a soap opera , you might be on to something . However , no daytime drama was ever so lavishly and well appointed.The title for 'Howard 's End ' comes from the country home of the Wilcoxes , in fact the property of Mrs. Wilcox , which she means for Margaret to have . She willed it to Margaret when they became friends , but Henry Wilcox suppressed the will after his wife 's death . In the end , Howard 's End comes to the Schlegels in a different way , as the world continues its unsteady path between Victorian/Edwardian sensibilities and the new world to come.This is a flawless film in many ways - well acted , well designed , well directed . This is a visual treat indeed .	1
I do n't mean this to be snarky at all , but I recently decided that I wanted to watch HOWARDS END again -- only to discover that I was actually watching it for the FIRST time ! I must have been thinking of REMAINS OF THE DAY -- or maybe I just was n't thinking . Does that say more about me than it does about Merchant and Ivory ? Is it really true that if you 've seen one M & I ; production , you 've seen 'em all ? Or am I just having another one of my cinematic senior moments ? Well , I 'll own up to it : these are my problems , not the film 's . There are , of course , a number of people who hate Merchant and Ivory productions and just about any other period film . I am not one of them . I found that I did like HOWARDS END very much indeed , and no , I can not recall actively disliking any M & I ; effort that I 've seen . Yes , the films are veddy British , and for some American viewers that equates to faw-faw-faw stuffiness . They 're wrong , of course . A film like HOWARDS END is as more a critique of the stultifying British class system than a Valentine to Britannia . Or maybe it 's both.HOWARDS END can seem almost as much a set-piece as a period piece in that it offers the viewer a schematic portrait of Edwardian society . You have three families each representing a particular social class ( the upper class Wilcoxes , the middle class Schlegels , and the working class Basts ) . In less careful hands , it could come off as almost too calculated , especially so since it is the middle class family which effectively `` mediates '' between the others.That is to say , the Schlegels mediate between their social betters and inferiors `` IN EFFECT , '' since their attempts to negotiate class distinctions circa 1910 are anything but `` EFFECTIVE . '' Their attempts are in fact disastrous and lead to tragic consequences for all ( although -- ironically -- the brunt of the tragedy is felt by the upper class Wilcoxes and the lower class Basts : while the middle class Schlegels seem to emerge from all the bad business around them , well , if not unscathed , then at least with their principles and humanity -- and lives -- still intact.The film is a surprisingly subtle and effective social critique made all the moreso by its insightful and humane portraits of all its characters . Not surprisingly , these are no mere stick-figure social stereotypes . We see all too well how entrenched class distinctions can be pernicious and debilitating for some -- and limiting for all . But even the film 's most boorishly snooty character has his endearing traits , and the wealthy clan 's pater familias is almost tragic in his isolation and emotionally cramped state.All of this complexity requires spot-on acting , and thankfully , the film is perfectly -- almost ingeniously -- cast . In fact , were it a gaudier spectacle , you might even be tempted to view the casting of political firebrand Vanessa Redgrave as a conservative upper class matron ( who is `` only too thankful not to have the vote '' ) as a kind of stunt casting . As it is , you have to at least see it as a delicious irony . And it 's so nice to see Antony Hopkins play a complex , conflicted ( but non-psychotic ) character . It has oft been asserted that he and Emma Thompson work brilliantly together -- and that 's true . It 's no wonder that they were set for a re-match in REMAINS OF THE DAY ( portraying -- interestingly enough -- more `` upstairs '' roles than the decidedly `` downstairs '' ones they have here : of course , these skilled actors pull off both masterfully ) .Speaking of being a firebrand , I suspect that for many younger viewers , particularly non-Britons , the perceived reservedness of Merchant and Ivory films and their muted social criticism , will not be not enough . HOWARDS END is a deft critique of English class structure , but it 's hardly a call to revolution . In the end , it is more of a character study than a tract -- which makes its small scale tragedies all the more human ( and in the modern sense ) all the more tragic . One comes away from the film with the realization that the social order necessary to maintain civilization has also inevitably set up barriers between individual human beings . And therein lies much of the tragic nature of we like to refer to as the human condition .	1
If you like Emma Thompson , Helena Bonham Carter and Anthony Hopkins you will enjoy this movie . And do n't forget Vanessa Redgrave .	1
I agree with J. Shands ( below ) that this new 2-disc set is now the definitive edition of this superb movie . This version was prepared with the help of the folks at Criterion ( like most of the recent Merchant Ivory Collection DVDs ) , and the result is an excellent DVD on all counts : image , sound , extras , and packaging . I never owned the earlier DVD of Howards End , but I did rent it . My impression is that this version is superior in every way -- it 's well worth the upgrade.The extras : ( 1 ) The original theatrical trailer ( standard issue and welcome ) ; ( 2 ) The original 1992 5-minute featurette about the making of the movie ( interesting mainly for the interviews of Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins ) ; ( 3 ) A new 45-minute documentary about the making of the movie ( detailed and informative , with some priceless bickering between director James Ivory and producer Isamail Merchant ) ; ( 4 ) A more in-depth look at the costumes and award-winning set design ( basically a 9-minute extension of the 45-minute documentary ) ; ( 5 ) A 5-minute ad for Cinemax 's March 1992 5-film celebration of Merchant Ivory 's 30th anniversary ( this is an easter egg that can be easily found on the main menu of disc 2 ) ; and ( 6 ) The 50-minute 1984 documentary The Wandering Company which covers the early history of the Merchant Ivory company ( an unusual choice for inclusion in this set since it ends with 1984 's The Bostonians , but welcome nonetheless ) .Even if you do n't consider Howards End one of the best films of the 1990s , as I do , it 's still probably Merchant Ivory 's crowning achievement , and this DVD treats it with the respect it deserves . Highest recommendation !	1
This is one of my favourite British dramas . I love the pageantry of it all . The costumes , the settings , the cinematography and of course the British accents . I think most americans wish they had a british accent , hence why we are drawn to films like this . We could only wish . The story is quite compelling as Howard 's End drawns you in , as the soap opera unfolds . The storyline is a bit complex so you really have to pay attention and not completly zone out . One can easily get lost if all you are paying attention to are the boofy hats . There is so much more to Howard 's End .	1
Viewed : 11/11Rate : 911/11 : Nowhere to Run is one of the best Jean-Claude Van Damme 's movies made because the film has it all : the cast , the acting , the action , the story , the villains , the drama , and the realism . You will see so many action movies of 80 's and 90 's where people are throwing shadow punches and kicks , but not in Nowhere to Run . This is as real as it gets . Jean-Claude Van Damme is quite a likable guy in this film despite the fact that his character is an escaped convicted felon . I love the cast of supporting actors and actresses : Joss Ackland , Ted Levine , Rosanna Arquette , and Kieran Culkin . Because of Mookie , there is a lot of similarities to a Western called Shane which makes Nowhere to Run an appealing film to see . It helps a lot in the end that Van Damme 's character was arrested to retain the intelligence of the film . Obviously , the real meat , where all fans of Van Damme look for , is his moves , and they are all outstanding . Van Damme shows a definitely much better motorcycle action going on there than Tom Cruise did in Mission : Impossible II . All in all , once again , Nowhere to Run , along with Kickboxer and Bloodsport , is one of the best Van Damme 's movies made .	1
DVDS In Excellent Shape . Very Fast Delivery . Awesome Seller . Will Buy From Again .	1
its pretty good van damme dose what he dose best.. ! ! which is fighting nd acting	1
I wish time cop would be released on bluray by itself like this movie , rather than a double set . Better PQ than the DVD .	1
It took me many years to finally decide to watch The Quick and the Dead . It did n't look that interesting , and I thought had the potential to be a bad film . But Sam Raimi did direct it , so I knew there was potential for it to be good . And it is . Raimi is the man who directed the Evil Dead series , Spider-Man , Darkman , and The Gift , and helped to bring us Xena and Brisco County . So this western has the Raimi flair . It 's a straightforward story of redemption and revenge , told with Raimi 's stylistic flair . Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe give good performances , and Gene Hackman does a great job as the main baddie ( no surprise there ) . Even Sharon Stone does a good job of portraying Ellen with the right amount of anger , fear , and uncertainty . But Stone 's performance is n't quite as convincing as the other actors ' . There 's something missing from her performance . But it is a solid movie . The dvd contains no extras .	1
This movie , at its core , is a movie about vengeance for wrongs committed in the past , but it is also so much more than that . There is a fairly substantial A list cast in this movie and every aspect of the movie was well thought out and executed . While the ending is fairly predictable , the journey to get there is well worth watching and will have you on the edge of your seat .	1
Sharon Stone , Gene Hackman , Russell Crowe and LeonardoDiCaprio star in Sam Raimi 's 1995 western . A female gunslingerenters a quick-draw contest to get revenge on a sadistic mayor.Sharon is great in this and Gene is also a great villain as usual.This dvd has nice picture and sound , but only the trailer . Getthis terrific western .	1
The Quick and the Dead is a often silly and sometimes even cartoonish western about a women gunslinger ( Sharon Stone ) seeking revenge on the evil town tyrant ( Gene Hackman ) . He took her father away from her when she was a little girl and now she has her chance for revenge when there 's a gunslinger tournerment that he just happens to be enteredd in.Russel Crowe ( Gladiator ) co-stars as a preacher that reminds Stone of her dad . He 's Hackman 's prisinor who he loves to be-little and humiliate . I saw Crowe 's talent in this film as he 's fantastic and steals the show and it 's great to see that he 's a big star now . The cast is just great , besides there being Hackman , Stone and Russel Crowe.You also got Leonardo DiCaprio as Hackman 's son . Lance Henrikson ( Aliens ) and Keith David ( The Thing ) as gunslingers , Pat Hingle ( Batman ) as a bartender and Gary Sinise ( Forest Gump ) in small flashbacks as Stone 's father . Sam Raimi the director of Spiderman 's direction is always lively and hardly ever boring and his direction here is very lively and always keeps you interested . The film 's biggest flaw is the cartoonish big holes you see in a gunslinger when they get shot . Other than that I think this film is a lot of fun , especially for Sam Raimi fans .	1
great cast played thir parts with great gutso.gene hackman brillent as usual mean as ever.great to see the movie in blu ray .	1
A lot of people got a good career boost from this movie . I think this is Gene Hackman at his bad guy best . From sunglasses to power lines to dynamite , this is western parody at it 's best .	1
Great weird western from Evil Dead/ Spiderman director Sam Raimi . A terrific cast and terrific bunch of western archetypes . Gene Hackman is nicely over the top as the baddie who runs the town , Sharon Stone is a sexy gunslinger out for revenge ... Sexy REVENGE ! Well , not that sexy , Leo D is a natural as `` the Kid '' ... The neophyte gunslinger out to prove himself . And Russell Crowe is the killer turned Preacher forced to amend his past by taking up the gun again . It 's got ta be the only film that Sam 's '73 Oldsmobile Delta 88 is NOT in though ... Maybe I missed it . But do n't TOU miss this !	1
I bought this movie for 1 reason : Russell Crowe . Not only can he act , he 's my age & amp ; he 's gorgeous . The film was better than I thought it would be . Stone should try a movie where she does n't have to take her clothes off , Hackman did Hackman & amp ; I 'm not a fan , then there 's the twit from the nudity boat movie , yuck .	1
This movie must be one of the greatest western made movies . The casting and the shooting action make this one of the best western films I have ever seen .	1
THE QUICK AND THE DEAD has to be one of the most heartwarming movie westerns of all time . It has SHARON STONE as a gun slinging woman back to test the taste of vengeance . Gene Hackman co-stars with Leonardo Dicaprio . This movie has some fine music scores and an excellent camera work out .	1
Unreal . This man has taken over a town that is out of control . He decides there will be a shoot to the death contest with all of the gunfighters in town . Only one left standing . Leonardo de Caprio is very young and handsome in this one . He is the cocky but sweet son of the owner of the town .	1
REST IN PIECE SIR TONY SCOTT , DIRECTOR OF REVENGE . HOLLYWOOD HAS LOST A TRULY GIFTED FILMMAKER . SO PROUD TO BE A FAN AND TO OWN ALL HIS FILMS .	1
COSTNER WAS GREAT ... one of his best movies , a good love story if you like adultery the end was sad..so prepare	1
This movie was great but very sad . I recommend anyone who likes it bittersweet to watch this . Well written and great actors make this a repeat for me .	1
such a haunting love story , very powerful , sticks with you long after you have seen it . It is one I 'd see again and I do n't usually like to repeat viewings .	1
The most beautiful but tragic love stories ever . The love scenes are beautiful along with the scenes of the two falling in love . The end I still cry my eyes out till I have a headache all day !	1
This is not bad for Kevin , shows power and control of cartels in Mexico . If you are of week stomach , do n't watch movie .	1
... Costner 's character did not want to go down that road , but the lady of the house was beautiful and he could n't help himself . Stowe wanted to remember what love felt like : she was being kept by the Latin aristocratic ancien regimefigure Anthony Quinn ( in full Onassis mode ) , who loved her like a caged canary which is admired from outside the cage ... So , Costner , the pilot , and Stowe ( the nearest thing this Mexican land has to Evita ) plans The Getaway , The Tryst , The Tete-a-tete ... and just when they feel the world could n't be any more heavenly , WHAM ! Quinn and his men beat Costner within inches to death , they shoot the dog , they slash Stowe 's beautiful face in half and throw Costner out in the road somewhere and Stowe in the Bordello so any one with the price to have her , can have their way.And that would 've probably been the end of the story , except Costner had fallen for the lady which has made him lose so much.He wants to find her and he wants to get in touch with these dirty rats who did this to them . And he goes thru hell and high water to get to that point.This is n't exactly a quick-edit , fire and explosions action flick . It moves slow . In fact , some critics say it moves too slow . But mebbe them guys did n't get it . It 's slow and gritty and dusty and muggy and foggy as those days in Mexico can get . It has some breath taking camera work of the Mexican country side and some equally effective shots of lowlife in Mexican border towns . There are scenes which make you feel like you should get up and take a shower , they are so musty and full of sweat . And there is so much about honor between men . And dishonor between men.And , to me that 's the point.And , like in real life , in the end , the boy gets the girl , but at a great price .	1
THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE . DEMI MOORE SHOWS WHY SHE MAKES THE BIG BUCKS . SHE IS EXCELLENT IN THIS MOVIE . SHE PLAYS A PREGNANT WIFE WHO GETS WRAPPED UP IN SAVING THE WORLD FROM EVIL . THE KEY IS HER UNBORN CHILD . SHE HAS TO MAKE THE DECISION OF HER LIFE , THE LIFE OF HER UNBORN CHILD AND THE END OF THE WORLD.IT HAS A GREAT CAST , DEMI MOORE AS ABBY , HER HUSBAND IS PLAYED BY MICHAEL BIEHN AND THE DRIFTER THAT STARTS THE WHOLE THING IS PLAYED BRILLANTLY BY JURGEN PROCHNOW . THE STORY , SPECIAL EFFECTS AND CAST ARE JUST EXCELLENT . IT IS A NEW TWIST ON THE CLASSIC FIGHT OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL , WITH A VERY SAD ENDING . GET THE TISSUES OUT FOR THE ENDING .	1
WoOoOoOoOo ! A pregnant lady is entangled in a religious burden of sorts . She begins having disturbing dreams , follows her tenant around and stumbles onto something which leads her to believe her tenant is actually after her baby 's life ! LOTS of mini-plots embroiled into this one . Moore is wonderful ! If you like pseudo-religious horror films IE : The Prophecy , Stigmata , Constantine or even The Sixth Sense you probably will enjoy this one . The film is both closed captioned and subtitled in English .	1
The Seventh Sign is one of those Sleeper Movies you hear about . It might take two or three times watching it before you start to realize the deeper implications . Unfortunately most people now , do n't have the time , or the attention span to sit through a movie more than once , but I can honestly say that it 's one of my favorites . When I first saw it , I was still in my teens and it stuck with me . I have a copy on video and now a copy on dvd . A lot of people wo n't understand or get the biblical references and inferences , but my advice would be to just sit back and watch . It is creepy , surreal , and , ultimately , a movie of sacrifice that leaves you wondering what you would do . Demi Moore was really beautiful as Abby .	1
While it did not have a feel good ending in some ways , it did in others . I thought Demi did a really good job .	1
Better if it was in HD !	1
Want excitement want a thriller whatch this one very good directing and great acting will keep youre stomach and mind nervous as you wonder what the next move might be .	1
Since I did not expect an action-packed on-your-the-edge-of-your seat film , I was not disappointed with this movie.I saw it as basically a character study , between an older , more experienced man ( Tom Berenger ) , and a younger , inexperienced and proud man ( Billy Zane ) . They are foisted together on a jungle mission , and while Zane 's character is *supposed* to be the superior officer , he soon learns that he is out of his element . Berenger 's character calls him & quot ; son & quot ; as he leads him through the jungle , being simultaniously irritated yet supportive over Zane 's inexperience.I found myself caring about these characters , and appreciating the contrast between them . While this film had flaws ( the ending , while adequate , lacked a little & quot ; punch & quot ; ) , I still enjoyed the movie overall . The performances of both actors was good -- particularly Berenger , who does the & quot ; steely emotionless & quot ; thing quite well . Zane was also good at looking a little queazy and out of his element.I found this movie to be a worthwhile viewing experience . I hear that & quot ; Sniper 2 & quot ; has been filmed ( Berenger reprising his role ) , so I am interested in seeing what Berenger 's character is up to now .	1
This movie is awesome . I first saw it when I was younger and forgot how awesome it was . I 'm glad I ordered it , because I will watch it a bunch more times .	1
Bill Murray will always be one of my favorite comedians . His delivery is just perfect . He understand how to mold his & # 8216 ; every man & # 8217 ; in a way that feels fresh and interesting , regardless of how many times he appears to regurgitate the same shtick . Sure , he & # 8217 ; s had his failures , but as a whole the package he presents is admirable . Couple that with the fact that he continues to grow as an actor and adapt to the times is something truly commendable. & # 8216 ; Stripes & # 8217 ; is one of many war comedies to come out in the 80 & # 8217 ; s. Originally intended for Cheech and Chong , this film is surprisingly light on the drug related humor and instead a rather hilarious and astute parody of the realities of war.The film follows a VERY familiar formula of loser is left with nothing and decides to better himself by joining the army only to find out it & # 8217 ; s a lot harder than he expected . We & # 8217 ; ve seen this before . We saw a variant of this the year before with Goldie Hawn & # 8217 ; s Oscar vehicle & # 8216 ; Private Benjamin & # 8217 ; ( yes , I know that she was not a loser in the film , which is why is said & # 8216 ; variant & # 8217 ; ) . Murray and Ramis are a crack team though , and they make this dialog work remarkably well . With Warren Oates playing a comic variation of the standard drill sergeant ( R. Lee Ermy inspired , for sure ) , & # 8216 ; Stripes & # 8217 ; has a lot going for it.Mostly , the best aspect of the film is the fact that it doesn & # 8217 ; t feel dated . Even when compared to better known or better remembered films like & # 8216 ; M.A.S.H. & # 8217 ; ( which feels very dated despite being entertaining ) , & # 8216 ; Stripes & # 8217 ; still feels fresh and fun and still brings on the funny no matter how many times you see it.You can thank Bill Murray for that .	1
PROBABLY the best Bill Murray movie of ALL TIME ! A must have for the comedy collector . The extra scenes are neato how they mark them with a star during the movie . Funny Movie !	1
This looks awesome on a Kindle HD . Great picture and sound . I look forward to watching the whole movie at some point .	1
What can I say . Bill Murray rocks this movie . I would reccomend this movie to everyone . Great comedy great movie	1
Taxi driver John Winger ( Bill Murray ) and Harold Ramis enlist in the Army and meet a cast of unforgetable characters as they aspire to get through Basic Training . John Candy is included along with Dave Thomas.They march at their graduation and then go on a mission to recapture a weaponized RV . Fun and funny .	1
What I really enjoyed about this DVD is the Extended Version includes the bonus footage within the film and denotes on screen when never-before-seen footage begins and ends without pause.I wish other DVD movie companies would do the same thing.The cast includes the recognizable faces of : Bill Murray , Harold Ramis , P.J . Soles , John Candy , Sean Young , Warren Oates , John Larroquette , Lance LeGault , Judge Reinhold , Fran Ryan , Joseph Flaherty , Dave Thomas .	1
What can I say ? This is one of the great comedy films of all time and with the extra footage you get even more . Hollywood just does not make films like this anymore . I think because of the rightward political shift there is a lack of artistic freedom and experimentation in Hollywood today . Everything new seems to come from `` Independent '' films but does not originate with the big studios . Also , the authoritarian climate in America seems to have purged most films of a socially conscious message of any kind . Stripes , and even more so the extended version , at least gives a nod to some of the problems with the U.S. military . What would be radical criticism today was probably not even noticed when Stripes was released.I think that when you censor films to the degree they are today you lose something important . We are all part of the world we live in and when artists are not given the opportunity to address relevant social issues even in a comedic way the quality of the art suffers . I think we have seen this anti-liberty anti-liberal trend in all American media especially the music industry and the news . Hopefully it is time for a reversal and we can begin to see Bill Murray and others in films like this again.Stripes is simply one of the all time great comedies . I still continue to laugh like hell every time I see it.My one complaint would be that the film displays words at the bottom of the screen telling you when the added footage begins and ends . This is annoying and distracting . However , I did get used to it by the end and was able to ignore it . Perhaps this will be better in future viewings.I highly recommend this film . Bill Murray is the greatest !	1
So funny , you will recite quotes from the movie right on queue . Love Sgt Hulka . Hilarious look at the Army from an 80 's perspective .	1
Cast is excellent.Movie is funny to me , especially the marching and singing parts.I got like the portrayal of the Sergeant . The actor is good at that type of character.The first part is the funniest to me and when they get toward the endthey get lost in a vehicle and have adventures but that part was not as funny to me.Bill Murray and rest of cast did a good job .	1
I can relate to this movie STRIPES because i was in basic training in feb of 1981. the film was made 2 months before i got there my platoon sgt and staff sgt were extras in the movie . its a great movie	1
STRIPES is a lot like most early 1980 's comedies . However , there are a few things that set it apart . First , there 's Bill Murray . Lately Murray has been leading towards a more serious avenue in his career . However , Murray got his start in comedy and STRIPES illustrates why . Secondly , the film has a great supporting cast including Harold Ramis and John Candy . Finally , the film was directed by Ivan Reitman and most things that Reitman writes and directs are at least a par above the average . One last note , the film does n't have too much foul language and the only violence is the cartoony kind . However , the film does contain a lot of nudity ( most of which was unnecessary ) which prevents the movie from being much fun for the whole family . Other than that , STRIPES is a comedy & # 34 ; star & # 34 ; .	1
Good movie . Got ta love Bruce Willis and James Garner together . Lots of action and a bit of nastiness as well as romance . Would definitely recommend .	1
- Tom Mix : `` How many men you killed ? `` - Wyatt Earp : `` How many cars you got ? `` - Mix : `` About sixteen . `` - Earp : `` You got more cars . `` Did you know that , in the early days of cinema ( circa late 1920s ) , fabled frontier marshall Wyatt Earp came to Hollywood to act as a cowboy movie consultant , but that he ended up solving a murder mystery ? And with a little help from legendary silent western film star Tom Mix ? Dudes , hunker down and sip a rusty cuppa nostalgia , and let this movie tell you all about it.SUNSET , when released in 1988 , did n't do diddly in the box office . The film critics pretty much unanimously took a stinky squat over it . Me , I 've always liked it . Even now , after repeated viewings , I still enjoy the thrill and onrush of nostalgia at seeing two larger-than-life characters meeting up and running roughshod over vintage Tinseltown . That Wyatt Earp was actually a Hollywood technical advisor is true . That Earp and Mix were friends also seems to be true . But that they became tangled up in a murder case , well , that just may be stretching a good story . But who does n't enjoy a tall tale or three ? SUNSET is a mixed bag of genres . It 's an authentic looking period piece . It 's a seamy murder mystery . At times it 's a comedy . And , let there be no doubt , it 's most surely a western . In fact , traditional elements of the oater abound in this film . The trusty horse . The girl singing in the saloon . The barroom dust-up . The deadly shootouts . At the end , Earp and Mix manage to serve up a heaping of frontier justice and ride off into the sunset.Writer/director Blake Edwards had originally wanted Robert Duvall to play Tom Mix , but did n't have enough green in the budget . So the part went to Bruce Willis , who back in the late '80s , was still an up-and-coming film actor . So , even though Bruce gets top billing , he actually plays second fiddle to Garner . I do n't know if Tom Mix was actually this flashy and stylish in real life - his wardrobe is , whatchamacallit , cowboy sartorial - but Bruce Willis pulls off the role with easy-going panache . But I was actually hoping he 'd yell out his patented `` Yi-pee-ki-yay , m @ ^ & * $ % s ! `` But , do n't get it twisted , Garner owns the film ( and , in fact , gets more camera time than Willis ) . James Garner is an actor who 's handled his weathered years with grace and dignity ( he was around 60 when SUNSET came out ) . And he is perfectly suited for these types of roles ( in fact , he 's played Earp before , inHour of the Gun ) . As the Tombstone marshall , Garner exudes hard-earned experience and steely competence . He 's no-nonsense and straight-talking , and I found it wholly believable that even the self-absorbed lords and ladies of Hollywood would pause before effing with him . A fish out of water , but a self-assured fish , Earp 's restrained but amused reactions to his strange surroundings are worth waiting for . More than anyone else , James Garner lends the film its substance and credibility . I love this guy to death , man.It 's not a perfect film . In fact , I 'm curious to see how closely Blake Edwards adapted this film from Rod Amateau 's original mystery novel . As Earp and Mix rubbed elbows with the glamourous glitterati and navigated thru Tinseltown 's dirty underbelly , and even as they crossed paths with crooked cops , hoods with names like `` Dutch , '' and even one sadistic movie producer , I could n't help but wish , fleetingly , that Blake Edwards had dreamed on a larger cinematic scope . SUNSET , regretfully , is a picture of which vision is n't compromised whenever presented on the telly in a full screen format . To me , that 's sad . As it is , the film 's modest scale , its pedestrian mystery , and the sometimes plodding pace serve to bring the film down a notch or two.Another flaw is that the climax lacks that action-packed oomph . A showdown with the bad guys at the Academy Awards , and Wyatt Earp does n't even slap leather . Then follow that up at the pier with Tom Mix 's weak brawl with the evil clown . I expected more from these two dudes of action . As a fan of sagebrush shoot-em-ups , I did feel let down.Still , SUNSET is very watchable and often entertaining . It offers several highlight set pieces , my top choices being Tom Mix 's trick riding and Malcolm McDowell 's very nicely executed `` act '' at the first ever annual Academy Awards . But what I relish best is the easy camaraderie between James Garner and Bruce Willis . This rapport translates well to the screen , as Earp and Mix , being kindred spirits , form a rapid friendship , perhaps on the basis of commonality . Both have over time evolved into creatures of notoriety and , partly , of fabrication . Both wryly acknowledge this and have learned to live with it . As the aging lawman tells the celluloid trick rider : `` ... you and I , we 're a whole lot alike . Part fact , and just enough fiction to sell newspapers . `` Dudes , I got love for old movies . Back in '88 , SUNSET piqued my interest with its recreation of cinema 's golden age era . It became an easy must-see for me when I learned of the irresistible premise and that Garner and Willis would partner up . Notwithstanding all the snideness from the movie critics , this is a film well worth a look . And the movie critics , they can just go squat .	1
I must have been one of the few people who actually saw this film in a theatre when it was released . I got the impression I was the only one who liked it , too , and I 'm glad to see now that I 'm not alone . From James Garner 's always-likeable , always-masculine performance as Wyatt Earp to Bruce Willis 's engagingly flirtatious performance as Tom Mix ( and wearing some incredible outfits - he manages it beautifully and believably ! ) to a pretty darned good murder mystery , this film always pleases me . I guess perhaps the mix of old West and silent films confuses some viewers , but I found it very intriguing .	1
As they ride off into the sunset , it is actually the dawn of a new era . It celebrates the 1st Academy Awards in Hollywood . Two veteran actors get involved with the hijinks of the up and coming movie industry . Secret liasions , paid protection to the mob and police , and the usual gunfight all sum up this movie . There is enough action and the storyline keeps your interest . I highly recommend this movie . Give or take a lie or two !	1
You know director Blake Edwards from raucous hit comedies like `` 10 , '' `` Victor/Victoria and the Peter Sellers-starring `` Pink Panther . '' `` Sunset '' is a very different kind of film and - do n't scared off - it 's a SERIOUS comedy . The plot revolves around a semi-authentic enounter between silent film cowboy star Tom Mix ( Bruce Willis ) and legendary Old West figure Wyatt Earp ( James Garner ) . But it 's really of interest because of the villain that brings these two figures from different worlds and different generations together . The villain is HOLLYWOOD itself , in the form of sadistic , power-mad ( did I mention homicidal ? ) Studio chief , Alfie Alperin . SUNSET is a blistering attack on the mythmaking machine and people who ran it way back when and it 's fair to assume Blake Edwards was implicitly saying there are still two many lethal people in charge of too much of The Business . His acid wit , humanity and sharp eye for detail is all on vivid display and the performers , especially James Garner as Earp , are all first-rate .	1
If you would like to see a really great performance by Nicole Kidman , pick up a copy of `` To Die For '' at your local video store . Directed by Gus Van Sant , screenplay by Buck Henry from the book by Joyce Maynard ( both Henry and Maynard have bit parts in the film ) , `` To Die For '' is a wicked little gem of a film.Kidman won the Golden Globe award for Best Actress for her performance , and frankly I thought she should have gotten the Academy Award ( unless I remember incorrectly , I do n't think she was even nominated for an Academy Award for it ) . But she is absolutely brilliant in it : chilling , funny , scary , sexy , and horrifically evil.Kidman portrays Suzanne Stone-Maretto : a devious , calculating , self-centered woman who manipulates Larry Maretto ( a very sympathetic performance by Matt Dillon ) into marrying her , quickly tires of him when he tries to stand in her way of her greatest ambition in life , which is to be the next Diane Sawyer , and soon convinces her teenage lover to kill him for her . Sound familiar ? `` To Die For '' was loosely based on the real-life story of Pamela Smart , who seduced her 15-year old lover into murdering her husband.Joaquin Phoenix is Jimmy Emmett , the hapless student who becomes Suzanne 's lover ; Lydia Mertz is Alison Follard , a young girl who idolizes her ; and Casey Affleck is Russel Hines , another student who gets caught up in the scheme . Illeana Douglas is great as Larry 's acidic , loving sister Janice , who also gets one of the best lines in the film , and at the very beginning , no less ; and Dan Hedaya is Larry 's father , Joe Maretto . Dan Hedaya is a master of the `` Believe me , you do n't want to see me mad '' performance , with obvious menace just under a calm surface . The casting is great , and the performances are all right on target.Look for uncredited cameos by George Segal as a conference speaker , and David Cronenberg as ... you 'll just have to go see it .	1
Clever story with more depth that appears at first blush , directed with irony and a sardonic sense of humor by Gus Van Sant . Nicole Kidman plays an especially shallow TV weather person who gets some grunge kids to kill her husband for her . Her motive is , as Illeana Douglas , who plays the sister-in-law , says , `` he got in her way . '' This is a nice study of narcissism metastasized into psychopathology . She is headstrong , motivated and rather stupid . She thinks only of herself and would do anything for herself and would do anything to anybody who got in her way . And amazingly , she does.Matt Dillon is wasted as the husband ( in more ways than one ) . I 'm surprised he agreed to do the part . Kidman is mesmerizing and makes us believe in a slightly unbelievable character . We 've all known narcissistic little darlings who would kill you for the right shade of eye shadow , but to see it acted out so coldly and with such appalling stupidity , yet with a psychology so bizarre that it has to be real , fairly takes your breath away . It was especially apt that she had him killed so that her pointless little docu-drama `` Teens Speak Out '' could become newsworthy enough for national exposure . Consciously she does n't realize this : she has no introspection ; she just acts.Also cute is the way the picture is framed : a pseudo-documentary within a pseudo-documentary . Everything is so well orchestrated that when Kidman gets her surprising , but entirely appropriate comeuppance at the end , we are quite pleased .	1
Everything about this movie is perefect , but it is ultimately Nicole Kidman 's performance that stands out . Her outer physical beauty does not alter the fact that deep inside , her character is a ruthless , evil , cold blooded killer . It just goes to show that you ca n't judge a person by their physical appearance . The movie also does a great job of showing the three teenage characters as being basically losers who seem to be destined to be stuck in their small town for the rest of their lives . Little Hope , indeed . Oh , and the musical score is really great , too .	1
This is almost like a documentary film , even though it 's not a true story . But because it felt so real , has more of an impact ! It has Matt Dillion , Joaquin Phoenix in their earlier years and Nicole Kidman 's big break . I love mid-ending when she gets all sinister . Danny Elfman who scores this has the perffect theme for the character , mysterious and sinister . All in all , great film . Tthe title fits and this should be on tv more . Also arriving in this format , having a tv that could only play VHS 's at the time , I ordered it in this format and iit arrived it very good condition . Love it , might buy it on dvd if I find it in stores . Great product as well as movie !	1
Suzanne Stone ( Nicole Kidman ) will do anything to be the next Barbara Walters . She starts out as a small town weather girl and while making a documentary with some high school students , hatches a diabolical scheme to kill her husband ( Matt Dillon ) whose ambitions do n't match her own.Loosely based on the true story of Pamela Wojas Smart , this movie is a clever black comedy focusing on the blind ambition of Kidman 's character . She plays her as an outwardly dumb blonde who is , in fact , ruthless and willing to do anything to be famous . Joaquin Phoenix plays Stone 's teenage lover who blindly carries out her plan . He 's quite young-looking and completely believable as the adolescent pawn in her deadly chess game.The story is filmed like a documentary , in keeping with Suzanne 's goal of being a celebrated interviewer . Having the characters speak into the camera reduces the tension but increases the humor , as most of the people involved are completely gullible and fall under Suzanne 's spell . It 's a macabre story played mostly for laughs with good acting all around .	1
Funny , edgy , and tragic , Van Sant presents us with a brilliant portrayal of society 's naked ambition and hunger for fame and notoriety . The movie was funnier and more satirical than the book . Kidman is great as Suzanne Maretto -- she 's evil incarnate disguised as a cute , perky blonde with a penchant for bright , sunny-colored , coordinated outfits and loud makeup . On the night Larry was killed is when we first see her wearing a dark color . Underneath the Barbie doll is a despicable , dastardly soul hungry to join the ranks of Barbara Walters and Connie Chung . At the same time , we know that Suzanne , for all her disturbed efforts , will never , ever make it in big-time broadcasting . She does n't have the smarts or the savvy , but in her warped mind , she thinks it is her husband Larry that 's holding her back . Kidman is especially brilliant when her Suzanne tries so hard to be professional when delivering the weather reports , but ends up sounding silly and amateurish . Kidman is also great during the cocktail scene with the dirty old network executive and his sycophants , because she makes Suzanne sounds so cluelessly stupid . Additionally , I am amazed at how well Kidman mastered the American accent . Joanquin Phoenix rivals Kidman 's performance with his portrayal of the dim metalhead Jimmy Emmett , Suzanne 's teenage loverboy and husband assasinator . Alison Folland is also superb as the overweight misfit Lydia Mertz , who is dazzled and bewitched by Suzanne . The movie format is that of a series of interviews of the main characters , tied together with continous commentary by Suzanne which turns out to be a video she is making for her interview with a big-time network executive . It is Suzanne 's over-inflated ego and delusions of grandeur which renders her blind to evil in herself and in others ; she fails to see that the bigwig network executive is a cold-blooded killer like herself . Joyce Maynard , the author , makes an Alfred Hitchcock-like cameo appearance in the film as well . For me , the most chilling part ( no pun intended here ) was seeing the frozen body of Suzanne underneath the ice in her little coral pink business suit and gold Monet jewelry . One of the most hilarious and telling scenes was the shot of Faye Stone ( Suzanne 's overshadowed sister ) and Janice Maretto as bridesmaids in Suzanne 's wedding . As Suzanne 's bridal bouquet sails through the air , these two bridesmaids deliberately move away to avoid catching the flowers . Another fun scene was Janice Maretto skating blithely across the pond that has become Suzanne 's tomb . She was the perfect character to end the film with , as she was the only one who immediately saw through Suzanne 's cutesy facade .	1
`` To Die For '' is a mean-spirited little film and one that left something of a bitter taste in my mouth . Nearly all of the characters are painted with a very broad brush , and are made to look absurd and ugly for their stupidity , spitefulness and vanity . Such harsh characterizations may seem surprising coming from a director like van Sant , whose other films generally display a strong empathy and compassion for the wide range of humanity ( see : `` Drugstore Cowboy '' , `` My Own Private Idaho '' , `` Paranoid Park '' . ) Of course , it all becomes clear as the film progresses that the film is , in fact , a satire on a shallow celebrity- and media-obsessed culture . That is , such pathetic , shallow characters ( and the subsequent bitter aftertaste ) serve as a condemnation of a culture of headlines and breaking news and journalistic `` investigations '' in which small , humanizing details and character traits are lost so that the audience make a quick , untroubled about whether the subject is good or bad , malicious or benevolent . All subtlety is lost , and thus much of what makes us human.I do n't know if I 'll return to this film ( it is just a little too brutal for my tastes ) , but I 'm glad I saw it .	1
I love this movie . To me it 's one of Demi Moore and Rob Lowe 's best 80 's movies . It 's a classic .	1
Viewed : 11/07Rate : 811/07 : About Last Night ... is a very good film . In fact , I am quite impressed . I thought , at the outset , About Last Night ... was going to be hampered by James Belushi 's presence , but his performance turned out to be quite the opposite . It may very well be the best performance of the year . Yep , you heard me right ... James Belushi gave the performance of the year . Pondering about what made About Last Night ... to work out very well , it has to be the primary supporting performances of Elizabeth Perkins and James Belushi . Without them , Rob Lowe and Demi Moore would have never made the film workable . I saw a very natural chemistry between the two , and they had enough ability to hold their own . But let 's be honest , it 's really Elizabeth Perkins and James Belushi stealing the show . I thought Belushi was loud , crass , and obnoxious in About Last Night ... , but I immediately thought of Sidney Berger of Carnival of Souls . I found their performances to be similar , but James Belushi had more time to play himself . That was the face-value of his performance , and he slowly wins me over . Now , Elizabeth Perkins . She is the better version of Joan Cusack although both look almost alike ; this time , she is less annoying and more likable . She was able to play her role realistically as a friend with feelings . Interestingly , I am supposed to hate the two friends of the couple because of their behaviors and antics . But actually , that was the whole point of it . That 's why they turned in great performances because they succeeded in their tasks . When I think of About Last Night ... as whole based on feelings due to forces of dating relationships , they have hit right on target . Where Singles have failed , About Last Night ... succeeds and more . David Mamet once again wrote a great story , if not too redundant , since there have been many similar films . What makes About Last Night ... different is how enjoyable it was . It had enough romance , enough substance , and enough subplots to help About Last Night ... transform into a very realistic picture . Let 's go back to Demi Moore and Rob Lowe . Starting with the latter , I think he was too one-dimensional to handle the role yet , oddly , he was perfect . Maybe it 's because of his improvement going from About Last Night ... to St. Elmo 's Fire within a year . Besides , Rob Lowe was daylights better in Bad Influence . It is just hard to top that . Anyway , Lowe was able to hold his ground opposite Demi Moore , and he did n't spoil anything in the chemistry . Demi Moore , I think she acted much better than most films I 've seen her in . I did question if she was worthy of accolades , but I think it 's best to hold that thought until I see About Last Night ... again . Taking risks to bare her body , Demi Moore is the better actress for it . On the other hand , some negative parts in the picture are found . I think the word `` broad '' is used too much . The sex scenes were flat because I have to think back to Desperado ; another thought is `` Was About Last Night ... trying to compete with 9 Weeks ? '' The first half was somewhat corny , but the film improved from there . Its strong ending helped to offset the negatives . What I saw in About Last Night ... is the talent of Edward Zwick . He made a seemingly ordinary film with ordinary , if not redundant , script into a film that is quite good . Three years later , he would make one of the great war films : Glory . About Last Night ... is n't a film about fake people but rather routine people with human feelings . It had a great passage of time as it goes up initially and the slides down as the novelty wears off . One complaint should be `` Not enough of depth '' . That 's true , but I think I am more impressed with idea of just going by without taking itself seriously like Casablanca . About Last Night ... is a pleasurable picture with the intention of being a simple romantic picture with neither fireworks nor extravagance .	1
A movie from the 80 's for those who lived through that time . See Demi Moore prior to her `` enhancements '' .	1
Great movie . The only reason I 'm knocking a star is because it does n't come in wide screen .	1
So this is a typical 80s chick flick ... but , having said that , it 's also really funny . The exchanges between Belushi and Lowe will keep you laughing . Women and men will also feel a kinship to the main relationship on the screen , to the comfort levels involved with different levels of intimacy , of relationships , from dating to moving in together . Funny , sappy , and sexy ! ! !	1
This is a pretty good movie , although the initial effect is disconcerting , like watching a sit-com that is painfully real and not just escapist fare . The players , Demi Moore and Rob Lowe as the lovers , and Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins as their jealous friends , are very good , and Director Edward Zwick is to be complemented on getting so much out of all of them . The script , loosely based on David Mamet 's play Sexual Perversions in Chicago is filled with sharp , clever and sometimes insightful lines worth quoting.One is when Moore breaks off the relationship with her boss to be exclusively with Lowe . Taken back , he says , `` But I thought we had something special . '' She replies , `` No . It was sleazy . And now it 's over . `` Another is when Moore 's sensitive and brutally sarcastic ( and jealous ) friend Perkins arrives for Thanksgiving and says to Lowe about cloddish , working-class Jim Belushi , who has n't arrived yet , `` Your vulgarian friend is downstairs denting innocent people 's fenders . `` After the two lovers move in together , and she has more than a drawer in his apartment and does n't have to carry an extra pair of panties in her purse , they begin with `` I love ... '' ( awkward pause ) `` making love with you '' ( pure Mamet ) . But when he does n't share his feelings with her , she says , `` I do n't want to be your roommate anymore . I had a roommate . `` What she wants is emotional intimacy . A woman needs emotional intimacy because then she knows where she stands and she has some control . They move closer and she ( caught unaware ) says , `` I love you . '' He ( on the spot , camera close ) replies , `` I love you too . '' She sheds a tear , just one , as they hug , perhaps in joy , or perhaps because she does n't know whether he really loves her or not , and it 's so very , very important . The next day Belushi asks who said it first and cavalier Lowe says he did . Belushi , who boorishly fancies himself a lady 's man , lectures his friend on just how very poor studly style that is.About Last Night is really about forming and securing the bond between a man and a woman . It 's trial by fire . Their emotions are on edge and their individuality is threatened . And all around them are people and circumstances , and their very own animal natures , testing and probing the strength of the bond . When it breaks the pain is enormous.Lowe says : `` I did n't fool around . Not once ! '' Moore rejoins : `` Give the boy a medal . I did n't realize it was such a sacrifice . `` Then comes her awkward and sad double date with the nerdy card trick artist with the British accent . Perkins says , `` Could n't you just listen to him all night ? '' and we 're thinking , `` NOT EVEN for one minute . `` Meanwhile we have Lowe 's casual pickups . Meaningless sex , and then not even that . But when he saves his friend 's cafe , he grows up.Belushi and Perkins are wonderful as `` opposites attract . '' They fight the magnetism to the very end-speaking of which , the best part of the movie is the ending . It is perfect.It should be noted that the movie is larger than Mamet 's one-act play and covers ground not even considered in the play . The play was an insightful but somewhat crude comedy about sex . The movie is a popular drama about relationships .	1
I absolutley love this film . Rob Lowe and Demi Moore connect well , even though Rob 's acting talents are not quite up to par . Who cares anyway , the ladies are too busy drooling over his face . Jim Belushi is awesome as a jealous best friend just wishing he had a bit of Danny 's , ( Lowe 's ) , luck . Filmed throughout the beautiful city of Chicago , giving any single person a reason to move there . Anyone who dated in the mid-eighties can relate to this film . Some of Belushi 's quotes are so damn funny , I ca n't print them here without being censored . Great soundtrack also . Very very funny film , also looks great on dvd , exspecially the softball scenes . If you can remember the first time you moved in with a new love , this hits home and brings back memories . Infactuation , lust maybe first , but soon your home life changes , its up to you if your are fine with the changes . Down to earth film showing the turmoils and tribulations of living together , honest fun . `` I 'm going home , make some macaroni and cheese , seel the windows and turn up the gas . '' classic Belushi	1
You will be AMAZED at what they did to DAVID MAMET 's play & quot ; Sexual Perversity in Chicago ! & quot ; THRILL as ROB LOWE and DEMI MOORE let an innocent liaison become a LOVE AFFAIR ! WATCH as second bananas JAMES BELUSHI and ELIZABETH PERKINS steal the film ! THINK about the implications for love when CONVENIENCE and NECESSITY rear their ugly heads ! WONDER whatever happened to director EDWARD ZWICK and then remember he does & quot ; Once and Again & quot ; on TV ! ENJOY this adult comedy about ADULT relationships !	1
If there is any movie that realisticly portrays relationships , it is this one , Rob Lowe & Demi Moore are very believable as lovers who decide to live together in the hopes that they will live a long & happy life , but the perils of living together are explored very deeply here , as with any couple there are problems , past relationships , disapproving friends , adjusting to each other 's habits , it is all here & anyone who has lived with anyone will see the realism of this film , if you have not ever lived with your boyfriend or girlfriend this film will seem off balance , this is the perfect film for anyone who might be thinking of moving in with their lover or anyone who has second thoughts , highly recommended ! !	1
Now this is a great movie who everyone can truly enjoy . I did n't know that it was going to be so funny . Wesley Snipes Produce this movie and I had to have it . You will laugh your way through this movie .	1
If you enjoy gangsta action movies you are sure to enjoy this one with Mark Wahlberg and Lou Diamond Phillips . Good cast , decent story , and good music make it well worth at least a rental . I enjoyed it enough to want a copy of it . It reminded me of movies like `` 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag '' and `` Lock , Stock , and Two Smoking Barrels '' . When a group of gangsters does an independent job it goes very wrong . Especially for Wahlberg that plays the guy who literally does all the work and is very good at his job . Unfortunately the stress of a fiance and a lover wanting fine homes , cars , and lots of money is causing him to have a stomach ulcer and he ca n't poor the Milanta down fast enough . I recommend it .	1

This is a Outrageous Film to be Sure but for Die-Hard Fans of Action Films , will have one Hell of a Time with This Movie . Grade : B+ .	1
Making a Christmas basket for a big Mark Wahlberg fan ! Was able to get lots of his movies for great prices !	1
China Chow was excellent as a school girl in this comedy that pokes fun at gangster movies . A must see for Mark Wahlberg and Lou Diamond Phillips fans .	1
I am a little bit biased , since I am a Brian De Palma and Alfred Hitchcock fan . & # 34 ; Body Double & # 34 ; happens to be a classic , which many directors have paid homage to . Shot in Los Angeles , you will recognize many areas in the film , which will never be the same after having seen this masterpiece . De Palma effortless creates & # 34 ; Angst & # 34 ; and has you sitting on the edge of your seat . Maybe you find his cameo in the film ? This movie has influenced many great directors and even watching it now , I found new interesting details.If you have time , please check out the & # 34 ; Manhattan Dating Project & # 34 ; and let me know , what you think .	1
& quot ; Body Double & quot ; is , in every way shape and form , a modern masterpiece , the same way & quot ; Vertigo & quot ; was and is . Our lead man suffers a similar phobia and is enveloped by the same paranoia of a murder consipracy invloving the victim switch . Point of view shots are used in a simialr vein and our leading man constantly speaks in his best James Stewart drawl . Other than lacking the customary Deplama split screen ( which would have made the most sense in this of all Depalma films ) & quot ; Body Double & quot ; is spectacular . Low budget elements are a deliberate mesh with the story of making a low budget horror , dated music is well represented . The plot , on the other hand , is filmed with the brilliant conventions we come to expect from depalma . dennis franz is not as raw as he was in & quot ; Dressed to Kill & quot ; . Any NYPD Blue fan has got to check out & quot ; Dressed To Kill & quot ; to see the real detective at work . Here , you actually never know what is real and what is set-up making & quot ; Body Double & quot ; a quintessential thiller for all lovers of the genre .	1
This Film shows De Palma is top form . It 's his best Non-Mobster film , easily . Craig Wasson is great as the Un-heroic hero . He is a character with great depth and his action 's are totally realistic and believable , anyone who says differently must not have been paying close attention . The people that call this & quot ; Cheap porn & quot ; are nuts , It is a great story and a terrific film . And who better to learn off than Hitchcock . He is the master , and De palma has learned a few tricks off him ... So sue him .	1
Body Double is a DVD of the 1984 sensual crime thriller directed by Brian DePalma ( Casualties Of War ) . Starring Melanie Griffith ( Working Girl , Milk Money ) , this film tells the story of an out of work actor was chosen to look after a friend 's house in the upscale Los Angeles neighbourhood . Soon , he is starts to leer into another woman 's home and her sexual trysts with several men , until one of them kills her . So the actor must find the killer that will lead him into the sultry underbelly of L.A. 's sex-driven world , and to a very pretty hooker/porn star named Holly Body ( Griffith ) . Look for an appearance by 1980 's British Pop band Frankie Goes To Hollywood . the special features includes interviews with Griffith , DePalma and other cast members and crew , as well as trailers of other Sony Pictures DVD movies . Body Double is the perfect film for those who love erotic film noir .	1
I loved the acting in this movie plus all the twist and turns and the ending was a real surprise.Melanie Griffith was very young in this one and did a good job as well as Craig Wasson.You will love this one for sure , pay attention to all the details from the beginning to the end .	1
Well , maybe 4.5 stars . The first time I saw this movie I was totally taken in by the clever plot . Yes , there is a major scene that does n't quite work , but I commend Brian de Palma for admitting this in the Featurettes . These four featurettes are just as entertaining as the movie , and it 's interesting to see the actors 22 years after the filming reviewing their own performances and recalling their experiences . Anamorphic widescreen with no compression artifacts . Great soundtrack by Pino Donaggio , especially the music that plays during the dance scenes in the neighbor 's house . A fine DVD edition . Do n't read any reviews with plot spoilers until after you 've seen the picture .	1
'Bugsy ' tells the story of mobster/visionary Benjamin ( do n't call him Bugsy , at least not to his face ) Seigel . Sure he was a killer ; but he also was a family man , a lover , a multi-tasker , a man of exquisite fashion sense , and a visionary . His vision , you ask ? He had an epiphany in the desert and envisioned Las Vegas , and built The Flamingo Hotel and Casino , which got the roulette ball rollin ' . Perhaps his role in the creation of Las Vegas was exaggerated for dramatic effect , but Warren Beatty turns in a very compelling performance , supported by an excellent cast . The scenes between Beatty and Bening , his current wife , generate high voltage sparks , contrary to the rule about casting a married couple as lovers since they are so familiar with one another . 'Eyes Wide Shut , ' anyone ? Either 'Bugsy ' was shot before the two actually got together , or it flies in the face of The Coolidge Effect . The Beatty/Bening match up is like a prize fight , something that is right at home in Las Vegas . Here is where they first meet : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - '' Bugsy '' Siegel : Got a light ? Virginia : The way you were looking at me , I thought you were going to ask for something more interesting . `` Bugsy '' Siegel : Like what ? Virginia : Use your imagination . `` Bugsy '' Siegel : I 'm using it.Virginia : ... Let me know when you 're finished.=====================================Another scene that reveals the complexity of Seigel 's character , as portrayed by Warren Beatty , is when he negotiates cost over runs at his home while simultaneously trying to preside over his daughter 's birthday party , wearing a white baker 's hat and jacket . Can you say multi-tasking ? It is quite a feat of juggling , despite the fact that he drops the main ball , and the scene of him sitting dejected in front of his daughter 's cake with the candles melted down to wax puddles speaks volumes.Here we have a cold blooded killer who will choose silk ties and designer shirts for a bookie just before he shoots him . Always seeking to improve , he practices his diction relentlessly : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - '' Bugsy '' Siegel : Twenty dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet.================================Can you say Self Improvement ? Bugsy was certainly not your average gangster , and 'Bugsy ' the film is not your average gangster movie . Great performances from Beatty , Bening , and the rest of the stellar cast , 'Bugsy ' is a most worthwhile use of your film watching time.Barry Levinson ...

Bugsy Siegel : mobster lunatic visionary , poet , prophet , a mercurial monster and marketing supergenius , a living contradiction , a man known to fly into a wild rage if a stranger called him `` Bugsy '' to his face , who simultaneously encouraged his Nom De Guerre among his friends , his enemies , and his publicists.Bugsy Siegel , who revelled in his gangster image , even had screen-tests shot of himself with a Tommy-gun looking hard and `` blazing '' away at the screen -- -this hardboiled felon worked slavishly at English diction to erase traces of his Brooklyn brogue.A suave wildman and visionary who made water -- -and money -- -flow in the middle of the desert , and even volunteered his services to put a bullet through Mussolini 's heart . 'Now : to crawl over the crater-pocked landscape of cinematic exposition here would be a bore and a waste , compared to the embarrassment of riches that is Barry Levinson 's masterpiece `` Bugsy '' , a flick that will go down with `` Scarface '' , `` The Godfather '' , `` Goodfellas '' , and `` Heat '' as one of the greatest gangster classics of all time . This is a gorgeous , sumptuous , lush , seductive movie . Watch it.You 're in competent hands here , Gangster . Check that Tommy-gun and let 's add up the bar tab on this piece of work -- -you remember things from `` Bugsy '' , forever , seared into memory because that 's just how good this movie is : *Bugsy ( Warren Beatty , at an effortless best ) catching the scent of a woman and waking up with her hours later , setting the stage ; *Bugsy kicking the tar out of a mobster who lewdly insults new gangster moll Virginia Hill ( played winsomely by an insanely delectable Annette Bening ) , kicking the thug into yesteryear -- -and still checking his hair in the glass ; *Bugsy , eyes covered in cucumber-slices , lounging in terry-cloth with crony mobster Mickey Cohen ( the incomparable Harvey Keitel , underplaying it masterfully ) by the pool ; *Cohen and Bugsy , framed against the bleak Nevada desert , suits crisp , sky searing cobalt blue , plotting a gambling Sin-iverse , Virginia Hill stealing off to LA in a steely dorsal-finned Cadillac ; *Bugsy and a pauncy , childish , confused Harry Greenberg ( Elliott Gould , packing lots of flesh ) going for a 'ride ' ; *Bugsy , eyes cloaked in stylish tech-noir shades , fulminating against Meyer Lansky 's ( Ben Kingsley , in fine form ) accountants , who serve as the vanguard of the Mob protest against the Flamingo 's ever-skyrocketing cost overruns , the sand , the silt , the callousness ; *Bugsy forcing a mobster to crawl on the floor of his office , barking like a dog -- -and Virginia Hill , realizing the blood of a cruel monster that flows through her mercurial lover 's veins , passionately kissing his hand -- -*Virginia Hill and Bugsy parting , at the biplane . This is a scene seared in my memory : a classic , like the `` We 'll always have Paris '' Bogey line . Fog . Mist . Merciless Weather . The Mob , moving in for the Kill.Bugsy Siegel was a shark in human skin , the American Dream made flesh . He deserved a great cinematic biography : Levinson delivers in spades . Watch this one , it 's for the Ages : if you do n't love it , you do n't have a pulse.JSG	1
I 'm reading all these reviews of a film I really lovedbut have n't seen in years , `` Bugsy . '' But I WANT TO KNOWAND HEAR FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE seen the `` EXTENDEDVERSION . '' All of these reviews are for the original theatrical version which does n't help one who is decidingif the `` NEW '' version really makes a difference.So please , if you seen the `` extended version '' give us YOUR review !	1
`` Bugsy , '' 1991 , a biographical crime drama nominated for ten Academy Awards , sure looks and sounds like a gangster film . It was nominated for Best Film in 1991 , received the most Oscar nominations that year , in fact , and actually won two Oscars . ( It lost Best Picture to `` Silence of the Lambs , '' as Warren Beatty , who co-produced and turned in one of his strongest performances as the title character , lost Best Actor to Anthony Hopkins in `` Silence . '' ) Anyway , it earned another seven miscellaneous awards , and was nominated for twenty more : it 's widely considered one of the best movies of the 1990 's . As written by James Toback , directed by Barry Levinson , and scored by Ennio Morricone , it 's highly evocative of its era , and neonoir Los Angeles.Warren Beatty fully inhabits the title role : Benjamin Siegel , famous 1930's/'40 's Jewish mobster , whom you did n't dare call Bugsy to his face . The man was handsome enough ( played by Beatty , after all ) , to dream of a Hollywood career for himself after taking up LA residence . He was unbalanced enough to imagine he could organize a plot to kill Italian World War II Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini from LA , and dreamer enough to create Las Vegas from the desert , but not organized enough to bring it in on budget , which proved his undoing . His rage , and violence when aroused , were also plenty scary enough.Beatty is ably supported , as to the underworld , by Harvey Keitel , turning in a meaty , Oscar-nominated performance as feared Jewish LA mobster Mickey Cohen ; and Ben Kingsley , doing his incomparable menacing best as Jewish underworld figure Meyer Lansky . Elliott Gould adds luster to his career as hapless Hary Greenberg , who gambled above his head , and socialized above it too . Joe Mantegna fails to bring much to his role as George Raft , gangster movie star of the 1930 's and '40 's , who was a known associate of Siegel 's . Babe Neuwirth turns up in a small role as an Italian countess , one of the many women Siegel could effortlessly manipulate . The costumes call up the glamour of the age ; the cinematography gives us LA at its most noir , all those rainy nights , and in color , too.And then , the picture introduced to a larger audience Annette Bening , playing the ravishing , potty-mouthed , long-legged Hollywood starlet of easy morals , Virginia Hill , as it introduced Beatty and Bening . ( Hill had been nicknamed the flamingo for those long , long legs : Siegel named his Vegas hotel , the city 's first , after her : The Flamingo . ) Anyone can see these two beautiful people , Beatty and Bening , falling in love onscreen : they would marry offscreen . They are so obviously in love , so hot hot hot , they give the movie an emotional kick not generally found in gangster pictures . They actually create a chick flick at its heart .	1
Bugsy is easily one of the most handsome pictures of the 90s , but on a second viewing it 's a little less impressive than it seemed at the time . Siegel 's life and crimes were too all-encompassing for anything less than a mini-series to do justice to it , but even so it 's curious that for a film concentrating on his time in Hollywood and his fatal dream of turning Las Vegas into a gangster 's paradise avoids his attempts to squeeze the studios dry by offering a union-fixing protection racket , one of the great untold Hollywood stories of the 40s . But what it does do it does well , offering centerstage to its charismatic , contradictory , impulsive and sporadically violent anti-hero and his equally contradictory lover . The violence is n't glossed over ( indeed , Siegel 's humiliation of one underling acts as a turn-on for the far from saintly dame ) , although Warren Beatty does n't always quite convince when he 's required to be pathologically sadistic.The supporting cast are pretty impressive , especially Ben Kingsley before he disappeared up his own backside post-knighthood and Elliot Gould as a very simple stoolie , but it 's surprising that Harvey Keitel was singled out for an Oscar nomination for his good but unremarkable work as Mickey Cohen . Still , it did result one of the best pre-Oscar interviews of all time : when asked what he 'd do with his Oscar if he won , he casually replied that he 'd smash it over Edward James Olmos ' head ( Keitel 's wife had just left him for Olmos at the time ) . Maybe Keitel should 've played Bugsy himself ...	1
In addition that has already been said in the other review , the movie , the Deep advertises the island of Bermuda in the Caribbean . It shots the exotic marine life , the beaches and the way of life of its people . I do n't know about witchcraft or voodoo , but the island seems so fascinating to see that one day , I 'll come down and visit . I rate this movie & amp ; the production of the DVD to be excellent -- the sound effects , in particular .	1
I bought this movie for a friend who had seen it when it first came out and thought it would make a great gift ... it turned out excellent it is a great movie for those who like adventure !	1
I had a chance to revisit this film recently . This movie offers plenty of excitement underwater.Jacqueline Bisset 's performance is first rate and by the way , she looks great in a Wet T-Shirt and that underwater mask ! This is one of the reasons I liked The Deep !	1
This is the kind of film that can stay with you for awhile after you watch it : a haunting kind of film that is n't always pleasant or easy to understand but you remember it . It also helps to have a fondness for the 1940 film noir movies and a fondness for stylishly-filmed DVDs.It does n't help that it appears racist in nature with people of one color all being the bad guys while people with another color all the good guys . If the colors were reversed , twould there have been an outcry over screenwriter-director Carl Franklin apparent bias ? Regardless , this is still a fascinating movie that just oozes with the 1940s atmosphere . Great narration in there , a la film noir , great automobiles and great sets . It puts you right into the late 40s in Los Angeles , a little bit like the film Chinatown.Denzel Washington does a nice job with the narration and the lead role , the character of `` Easy Rawlins , '' off the book by Walter Moseley ( which I read and recommend ) . Tom Sizemore and Don Cheadle play very intense characters in supporting roles , particularly Cheadle as the trigger-happy `` Mouse . '' Jennifer Beals is alluring as the mysterious `` Daphne Monet . `` The film is a bit confusing in parts and was especially so for me since the book was not exactly the same and had a totally different ending . Nonetheless , the film has always fascinated me and drawn me back for multiple viewings . It 's good storytelling and it would be fun to see more of Moseley 's books translated to the big screen .	1
This film should 've been a hit since it was based on a well received novel by Walter Moseby and starred Denzil Washington as `` Easy '' Rawlins . Unfortunately it did n't get the notices it should have received due to the fact as Denzil stated that blacks do not like to see themselves as victims . Too bad because this film noir had an intricate plot involving a mysterious woman ( Jennifer Beals ) who 's involved in a murder plot which puts Washington 's character in peril and possible imprisonment since one of females he was involved in is found murdered . Another plus was Carl Franklin 's astute direction plus you also had Don Cheadle in a career breaking performance as Rawlin 's psychopathic buddy `` Mouse '' . The audience I saw this with , laughed and were engaged with this flick . If you like a good film noir/detective story and are a Washington fan , do check this out ! !	1
Film Noir is French for `` black film '' is it not ? In the tradition of The Big Sleep , Chinatown , Maltese Falcon , The Long Goodbye ... ... The first and only ( as far as I know ) that features a uniquely `` Black American '' cast and story line.BEST line in the movie `` If you did n't want him dead , you should n't have left him with me . `` Watch This Movie ... Buy this movie . I have 2 copies . Don and Denzel both rock .	1
i purchased this movie by mistake , but the movie was great . and , the acting was great . it is very enjoyable .	1
Billy Bob co-wrote and stars in this tightly woven , deeply textured , well-written off-beat thriller about a couple of drug dealers heading from CA to AK ; combines the personal , the interpersonal , the deviant , with an unusual love story embedded craftily in the middle . This was on Roger Ebert 's top ten list the year it came out . Although there are a couple of plot flaws , it works well enough to keep you anticipating the `` showdown , '' because these seem to be authentic people trapped in a tragic destiny . This is a rare type of film nowadays : the kind that comes from the heart , not from the sterile factories of M.F.A . programs and lunkhead studios .	1
I have to admit I never liked Steve Martin as a comedian . In this movie , however , he shines , dispalying his excepitonial tallent as both a writer and actor . It 's a brilliant piece of work.I do n't know what I can say that has n't already been said , except this : If you have n't believed any of the other people raving about this film , take my word for it and buy it . You wo n't be sorry .	1
This 1987 film is another brilliant collaboration between Carl Reiner and Stever Martin : bringing us a more jovial interpretation of Edmond Rostand 's famous play , 'Cyrano de Bergerac . 'The theme and plot is pretty much the same as the original except with a comic twist instead of a tragic one . Steve Martin is C.D . Barnes , the captain of a voluntary fire station at a ski resort . As with the original Cyrano , C.D . is a sensual and vocally articulate man who feels that his monstrous nose is always in the way of love . He soon falls in love with the beautiful Roxanne ( Daryl Hannah ) , an astronomer who just arrived to the town to chart the stars , but ca n't get himself to act . Finding out that Roxanne has the hots for a clueless hunk in his fire station ( Rick Rossovich ) , C.D . acts as the brains and mouthpiece while the hunk acts as the sexy model . Things get hot but somethings just do n't add up in Roxanne 's mind . The truth is soon unfolded and resolves itself in a happy ending for everyone.Another great work by Reiner and Martin whose comedies always touch the audience with revealing insight and wit . A fun movie for all ages and genders .	1
This film is just as charming & funny as when I first saw it in 1987 . Unquestionably , one of Martin 's best , ranking alongside `` L.A. Story '' , `` Planes , Trains & Automobiles '' and `` Parenthood '' .Only Martin could weave a whimsical romantic tale of a Seattle fire chief ( with a prominent proboscis ) who adores the beautiful Roxanne ( Darryl Hannah , naturally ) , who 's infatuated with the hunky new fireman ( timid but likeable Rick Rossovich ) who likes her too -- -but is terrified of talking to her.Martin modernizes the Cyrano deBergerac story with wonderful comic touches : A `` sword '' duel with tennis rackets & ski equipment ; Martin contending with a hopelessly inept fire crew ; a show-stopping bar scene in which Martin cuts a bullying lout down to size with a `` nose joke marathon '' ; and Martin coaching a bumbling Rossovich on how to romance Hannah . Yet , Martin wisely retains the heart of deBergerac 's original themes : Believing in oneself and the delirious intoxication of being in love.An overlooked comedy -- -and if you 're a Steve Martin fan , then this one 's a must !	1
Steve Martin is great in this movie and show a flawless ability for amazing comedic timing . Have always loved this one !	1
Did n't anybody else find Hannah 's performance here to be ... lacking ? She just does n't make it . The last scene , in which her character declares her love for Martin 's character , is almost unbearable for me to watch , she 's so lame and unbelievable . Despite her physical beauty , I ca n't accept that Martin 's character would fall for her . He 's so full of life and she does n't show near enough character to match him . I do n't think she 's a good actress.Sorry , Daryl .	1
This movie is all about Steve Martin and the character he plays . He is wonderful and I wish there were more movies of this kind around with Steve in them . He is the Movie . Get it .	1
This is one of Steve Martins best films ! No one could have made this better than him . Full of humor , warmth and cheer ! Darryl Hannah is great in it too . I watch every so often when I want cheering up !	1
Motorcycle movies start with this one . While a bit cheesy , it summed up the attitude of many generations . In addition to several cool bikes .	1
The gangs appear to have strayed from a Bowery Boys slapstick onto a set from a 1930 's western , with a budget of $ 50 and a director nowhere to be found -- still and all , the film proved remarkably adept at capturing a postwar mood among the young . Nothing may have looked real , but kids of the day got the message . History had not ended in 1945 : there was still a restless spirit out there that could not be captured by pre-war malt shops and Saturday night hops . The inarticulate Johnny ( Brando ) is the perfect embodiment of that angst . He 's groping toward something , but what . The gang rides around aimlessly , with no more knowledge of the road ahead than of themselves . Then too , it 's the elderly Jimmy , representative of an older , slower America , who 's revealingly run over by a run-away cycle . The sweetly pretty Mary Murphy attracts Brando , but she 's a baited trap -- he could end up like her father or the townspeople . Does he ever return to her ... is the trophy gesture a promise or a farewell ... Though severely lacking in some respects , the script wisely leaves such ultimate questions unanswered . And through it all , Brando , in black leather jacket , remains a powerful yet enigmatic presence . A worthy and enduring icon.Younger viewers might keep in mind that the movie was produced not only at the height of the Cold War , but at the height of the Mc Carthy purges in Hollywood . This , I think , accounts for much of the film 's schizophrenia -- many punches were pulled . No one wanted a movie that cast America 's youth in a bad light . So despite what was hinted at on screen , audiences were also told that everything is really alright . Level-headed authority ( Jay C. Flippen ) remains in charge and these are really overgrown boys who will eventually straighten out -- just look at their childish horseplay . It 's Brando 's smouldering presence that undercuts this comforting message . The audience senses that somewhere behind the defiant slouch lies a wisdom superior to the bland reassurances , if only he could find the words . Those , I suppose , would come 15 years later and in far different rebellious circumstances . Anyway , this is a Brando showcase without which the movie would lie long forgotten .	1
A classic , and Brando is handsome in a raw , untamed way . Breaks the star system and it 's portrait lighting of pretty boys and Hollywood pablum themes . Inspires the Beat Generation to go on the road . My favorite line that would launch thousands of rebels without a pause is when a woman asks Brando , & # 34 ; Just what are you rebelling against ? & # 34 ; and he replies , leaning on the handlebars of his bike : & # 34 ; Whatta ya got ? & # 34 ; Beatific !	1
This is the movie that started it all for the outlaw biker . Everyone including Sonny Barger ( the most famous Hells Angel ) saw this movie and wanted to become an outlaw . Unfortunately most bikers who gained their inspiration from this film identified more with Lee Marvin 's character Chino then with Brando 's Johnny . My personal interest in the biker lifestyle came more from Easy Rider than this flick , although I did use a Brando line from this film when I was a teenager and was called to the vice principal 's office . He had the nerve to ask me what I was rebelling against to which I answered in my best Brando imitation , `` Whatta ya got ? '' . This film is a bit cornball with the dialogue and storyline but I give it 4 stars on the impact it had on the American Biker mystique . 1 % ers forever !	1
I thought this movie was pretty entertaining considering its age . I was afraid I would n't be able to stay awake through it but it 's not one of those movies . It moves fast and its not long . I recommend to anyone going through a classic movie phase .	1
I tell the young folks - who do you think captured the way you walk , dress , act , and set the stage of fashion that lasts even today ( except for the cap ! ) ? James Dean and Brando told us what angry young men were thinking and how they dressed and acted .	1
The plot of THE WILD ONE gets its inspirstion from a true episode involving a gang of cyclists who terrorize a town in California . The story seems so dated that it is laughable but the movie still remains a classic for its time and genre.The film is most memorable for its glimpses of the early work in cinema of both Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin . Brando plays the leader of the gang in question . Marvin appears later in the role of the head of a rival gang . Marvin 's performance reminds me of Jack Palance 's part in SHANE which was also released in 1953 . These roles are similar in terms of the impact each had on the careers of the two actors .	1
If you are looking for a realistic portrayal of biking culture , go elsewhere . If you can enjoy a movie and overlook people riding bikes on a soundstage , this video rocks ! I show this to my middle school students for Social Studies , and they love it . It 's fun , and does not take itself too seriously . The stock characters and overacting start out great , but when the town descends into chaos and the inevitable vigilantism rises up they wo n't let me stop . I 've seen it ten times , and still enjoy it.The DVD itself is well done , and has stood the test of several viewings . I 'm not a big Brando fan , but he does have a presence . Lee Marvin is hilarious .	1
I do n't have this one in my library , simply because there is not enough of Pierce.I loved his character of Alex in this film , but there could have been more of his character.I wish there would have been more of a relationship develop between Alex and Rose.I felt sorry for Alex in the end , because Clair left him and then Rose left him.Rose always had a place for Alex in her heart . Even though Alex did n't love her til her big make-over , I got the impression that Alex did care about her . He was the one I felt sorry for in the movie , because Rose gets her man , and he is left all alone .	1
Jeff Bridges and `` Babs , Dahling ! '' combine efforts to spark an excellent look into modern romance from an academic perspective . The two Columbia professors meet through a personal ad , written by a sexually jilted Bridges and answered by lonely Streisand 's manipulative sister , after floundering through unsatisfactory relationships that left them both wanting more , much more . How do you find and maintain a lasting substantive love in a world that is aflame with `` silly romantic notions '' ? Great supporting performances are turned in by Lauren Bacall ( Oscar for Best Supporting Actress ) , George Siegel , Lucy Avery , and Pierce Brosnan . Marvin Hamlisch also walks away from the Oscars with Best Song . Last , but far from least , it is always a delight to watch one of Bab 's directed productions in which she also acts , admire her beauty accented by her remarkable nose : - ) , and also hear Barbra vocalize on the soundtrack . Buy the DVD and , like me , watch it over and over and over again !	1
i did like it , felt it was entertaining , not necessarily a great classic but just plain good entertainment . ya know what i mean ?	1
While this movie will never win any acclaim or awards , it was a light romantic comedy that hit a home run with me . I liked Jeff Bridges and Barbara Streisand together . They were funny and had good rapport together on screen .	1
Was a very good movie , light hearted and very entertaining . I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the two main characters . Very good !	1
a very good movie . Have not seen it in a while . But , I remember it being very good.Suggest it for all !	1
I really enjoyed this movie . It is definitely worth a second watch . It is a great romantic comedy . One of my favorites .	1
Sharon Stone has proven that she is capable of handling any acting role ! But it is up to us to go with what ever character type we like most . Here we see her as a caring woman after she gets cheated by her gang and rescues a child to whom she became a mother figure ! The element of suspense is there . The element of sweet unique drama is there and the satisfaction shall be there too if you can accept Stone in this new mold..PS The point that we are not used to see Sharon Stone in such a role ... does n't mean we ca n't accept her out of the sexy manipulative character as in Basic Instinct or Diabolique ! I advise you to rent at least ! It 's worth it .	1
Urban Legend : rated R , 1 hour 40 minutesThe cast of Urban Legend is proficient , but not excellent . Rebecca Gayheart of ( movie ) `` Scream 2 , '' Alicia Witt of `` Cybill , '' Jared Leto of `` My So Called Life , '' Joshua Jackson of `` Dawson 's Creek , '' and John Neville of `` The X-Files '' give satisfactory performances , but none dare to be anything more than mediocre.In the dramatic opening scene of the movie , a mysterious person in the backseat of the car beheads a college girl ( Natasha Gregson Wagner ) . After many more college students and administrators are killed , it is later found out that the murderer at Pendleton University is mimicking the tales of commonly told Urban Legends . Excitement builds up as the audience anxiously awaits the moment in which the killer will finally be revealed.Brutal killings including heinous decapitation and deathly asphyxiation occur frequently throughout Urban Legend . One almost grows accustomed to the gruesome sight of a human cadaver . At one point in the movie , a college student `` gets a call coming from inside the house . '' `` Scream '' anyone ? Of course after receiving the phone call , the young man within minutes dies an appalling death that should strike fear into the minds of any viewer . Believe it or not , on rare occasions , the audience is spared the display of what would have otherwise been a grotesque corpse.Urban Legend is a suspenseful movie that contains an ample amount of homicides , executed with a mild quantity of gore . The ending is rather absurd , yet somehow awfully entertaining , as the entire movie could be described . It is terrifying fun at the cost of a clever plot . Well , you ca n't have it all.Unintelligent , and purely enjoyable , Urban Legend , directed by Jamie Blanks , also starring Robert Englund and Loretta Devine , secures itself a B .	1
Plain and simple : I liked the movie . Making the urban legends come to life , using them as ways to off people was interesting . I like the twist at the end and the acting was good enough .	1
When this movie came out in theatres , I first thought it wouldbe another & quot ; Scream & quot ; and & quot ; I Know What You Did LastSummer & quot ; ripoff with a lot of gore and blood . But when it came out on DVD , I heard from others who saw the movie it was n't . That 's why I bought this movie and I 'm glad I did ! This movie has a quite original story and there even are some scary scenes ! Just like with & quot ; Scream & quot ; you are wondering who will be killed next and who the murderer is . I wo n't say who it is , because when you know that , this movie is n't that fun anymore.Altough & quot ; Scream & quot ; and & quot ; I Know ... & quot ; were a lot better , this is still a fun movie to watch with friends . If you like to guess who the killer is and do n't mind some disturbing scenes , it is a must see ! END	1
I 'll say one thing before I start this review - the critics for magazines , websites and whatever else are pretty unfair on this movie . They really do n't give many acceptable reasons as to why they dislike the movie . I think people like Roger Ebert and stuff look at the film and say - `` Ohh look ! It 's another teen slasher ! Let 's give it soley on the basis of its genre ! '' Well , I have to disagree and rate Urban Legend on a fair scale and be truthful to my own opinion of the film - I liked it . The whole premise was very original , and although some scenes mildly copied from Scream , the whole idea was new and scary and had a good thing going for it . The script carried itself well and the suspense could 've been built better but I felt tense at times in the movie . The performances were n't exactly brilliant , Alicia Witt and Jared Leto were good , and I liked the darkness of the girl who played Witt 's sister . I also enjoyed who the killer turned out to be , that was a pretty clever turn ! I did n't really like the motive but the actor played the part of the psycho excellently and I enjoyed the way the mystery was solved . The atmosphere of the movie was pretty plausible and I 'll repeat I really , really loved the premise of the film . It was a very good , original turn in teen slasher filmmaking . Overall , I thought Urban Legend was an underrated film , and one that I find to be very enjoyable and even at times quite a valuable horror flick . Do n't expect too much and I 'm sure you 'll like it ! Rating : 4/5 . Really enjoyed the making-of featurette and the commentary by the director . The trailer was also pretty interesting , but I felt there was something missing from this DVD .	1
Jared Leto ( Paul ) , Alicia Witt ( Natalie ) , Rebecca Gayheart ( Brenda ) , Michael Rosenbaum ( Parker ) , Joshua Jackson ( Damon ) , Tara Reid ( Sasha ) , and Natasha Wagner ( Michelle ) star in this well-conceived film about urban legends.In the opening sequence , Michelle is driving her SUV back to campus . Realizing she 's low on gas , she pulls into a service station . The attendant is acting rather strangely , and for some reason , he asks Michelle to get out of the SUV . He immediately tries to restrain Michelle , but she sprays him with mace , gets back in her vehicle , and speeds away . Chillingly , the attendant yells `` someone is in the back seat ! '' . Sure enough , an axe-weilding figure emerges from Michelle 's back seat and kills her.The rest of the movie takes place at Pendleton University . The students are involved in a Folklore class taught by Prof. William Wexler ( Robert Englund ) . Wexler entertains his class with stories of urban legends , which includes Pendleton 's own urban legend about an Abnormal Psychology teacher who murdered six students at Stanley Hall twenty-five years earlier . Eventually , the students learn of Michelle 's death , and Natalie begins to suspect that a killer is on campus . Meanwhile , Paul has written a story about Michelle 's murder which has infuriated the administration , especially Dean Adams ( John Neville ) . He is subsequently thrown off the paper , but he continues with his investigation.The murders continue , and , strangely , each has taken on the theme of an urban legend . One by one , the group of students is killed off by the maniacal killer with gruesome effect ; Parker dies by having draino poured down his throat , Damon is strung up from a tree , and Sasha is chased around the campus radio station with the microphone still on so everyone can hear her screams.Natalie tells Brenda that she and Michelle were responsible for the death of a teenage boy when they were in high school by driving with their lights off and waiting for someone to flash them . When the first vehicle flashed them , they turned around and chased the car until it ran off the road . The driver did n't survive.Soon , Natalie realizes that she and her friends are becoming part of the killer 's own urban legend ; the story of their own deaths . Will anyone survive , or will the killer succed in making urban legends out of them all ? This is a very good movie with an excellent and well-conceived plot , but the best part is the teriffic twist at the end . It is totally surprising , but when all of the details are revealed , the ending will make perfect sense.I highly recommend this great horror movie . The plot is scary and suspenseful , and the ending will definitely surprise you . Watch and see some great urban legends and a thrilling ending , too .	1
I really enjoyed this movie . From the moment the gas station guy yells at this girl , & quot ; There 's someone in the back seat ! & quot ; , my full attention was given to this movie . The story line is what makes this movie a smash . I am fascinated by serial killers for some reason and even a dumb movie like & quot ; Serial Mom & quot ; appeals to me . I never knew what an urban legend was until I saw this movie , and now I know what to call them . I heard of a few of the legends before and it really excited me to try and discover which legend the killer would use next and who would be the next victim . A must see action-packed thriller !	1
I love having this movie on the Kindle so I can watch it anywhere . I have watched it many many times .	1
I watched this movie with rather low expectations . To be totally honest , I expected something of the & quot ; Scream & quot ; genre ... a not so scary movie with a bunch of & quot ; pretty white kids with problems & quot ; running around , having sex , and eventually getting offed by some superhuman psycho . Boy , was I surprised ! This has got to be one of the most imaginative horror films I 've ever seen . The premise of the film is great and the movie itself is well written . This is not your typical horror film.On a side note , I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that previous knowledge of urban legends ruins the movie . I 've followed urban legends ever since I learned how to read . I knew about most ( if not all ) of the urban legends that were used in the film . It did n't ruin it for me .	1
Yes , this movie pre-dates the Matrix and in fact has a much more interesting storyline than that film . I see why the 2 are so often compared , but I would describe the 13th Floor as an intellectual version of the Matrix.The plot has already been discussed so I am going to simply mention some of my favorite aspects of this film . It was fascinating how these programmers could create such a realistic virtual world , wherein the people are programs and have no idea of the truth ( see , how the Matrix ripped it off ? ) . Imagine finding out you are nothing but a bunch of 1 's and 0 's and there is no possibility for change or escape ? It is exceedingly clever how one character leaves clues in the virtual world that allows another character to help solve a mystery in the real one.Interestingly , perhaps due to a limited budget , more attention was paid to the actual story instead of filling the screen with all kinds of cheesy cgi , which resulted in a better , more fulfilling movie , as opposed to a simple action flick.Vincent D'Onofrio submits yet another stellar acting performance . I am always floored by how he can look so completely different from one role to the next . Check out the brilliant independant flick , Salton Sea , if you are a fan . ( As an aside , while I did not particularly enjoy The Cell , Vincent gave the most chilling performance I have ever seen in my life and one that I will never forget ... too bad Jlo was involved . ) If you are interested in the concept of virtual reality or even parallel worlds , or maybe just new types of entertainment technology , you will no doubt enjoy the 13th Floor . While it is a slow-moving drama , the intriguing storyline and believable performances will keep you more interested in this film in the long run than some cheesy , special effects laden popcorn flick .	1
Great thriller , which will keep you guessing until the last frame . The last twist makes you question what reality is.It made me ponder whether we really are at the top of the food chain or whether we simply serve as food for hyperdimensional beings ? An interesting question which Gurdjieff , Carlos Castaneda and the Sufis amongst others have alluded to . For exploring this question I can recommend the book by Laura Knight-JadczykThe Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alivefor starters .	1
Why do so many reviewers compare this movie to the Matrix ? This movie is nothing at all like the Matrix . If you are ever in the video store and ca n't find anything good to pick up you might want to give this movie a try .	1
This is a great film which is often overlooked , which is very sad.Set in the late 90s , this film has a very different take on the `` our world is n't real '' plot line . The characters have depth , are well developed , and intriguing . The period scenes are shot with a different lighting which makes for a unique visceral perspective.If you like the concept of the Matrix , and if you like well-developed characters , this is a fantastic movie you should consider . Plus , it has a great ending before surprise twists became the fad and norm.Ever since I saw it originally in the theatre , this has been one of my favorites . I 'll throw it in on a random week night , and I 'm always pleased with the decision .	1
I originaly saw this movie on TV ; so much one of my favorites . After I began collecting DVDs , I spent several years trying to find it . I came up with some interesting movies . Most people thought I was referring to `` The Matrix . '' The problem was I could not remember the title . When I found that the movie came from a novel , I , of course , read it ; `` Simulacron 3 . '' I love the premise . There is a short TV series of this story around someplace . I 'd sure love to get my hands on it . Anyone know where I can find the series ? GEM	1
What makes this movie special : 1 . Amazing scenes of the 1930 's . 2 . Interesting plot that gets you sometimes lost in a maze of thoughts . 3 . The main actor in this film was Craig Bierko . And he succeeded in his good performance.The only mistake in this movie was the last minute of it ! Yes , the CGI of the year 2024 was POOR ! I recommend watching it , and you might need to do so twice at least to gather all your thoughts together !	1
This movie is one of my all time favorites . While not widely known , it is fresh , ingenious , well executed and very well cast , particularly Gretchen Moll , whose beauty reminds you of Grace Kelly . There are ideological similarities with the martix , but where that film opted for FX and fluff , this movie opts for substance . I was particularly impressed with the feel of the roaring twenties they created . This movie has longevity and stamina in the same way as & quot ; Highlander & quot ; . You will find yourself rewatching and turning friends on to it as well . A true obscure gem .	1
If you 're into movies about alternate realties , this one 's a definite must see . The story revolves around a murder but who is the killer and from where and which reality ? Great acting , direction and plot developement . And an ending which wo n't leave you disappointed .	1
Despite all the bad reviews I have read for this film , I LOVED IT ! I have watched it numerous times and I still continue to watch it . If you are a sci-fi buff , you will like this . I saw this in the theater and , unfortunately , it was only there for about 2 weeks ( or less ) . I think I recognized the twist before it happened , but this movie definitely keeps you in anticipation . I think The Thirteenth Floor would have definitely gotten more of the spotlight had it not been released at approximately the same time as Matrix , but if you 've seen the Matrix , you 'll most likely enjoy a great flick like Thirteenth Floor .	1
This movie has taken me by surprise . It 's a kind of mix between Matrix and Dark City , but in many ways it undoubtly appears superior to them because of its high cleverness and its successful eerie atmosphere . Especially the recreation of 30 's Los Angeles is breathtaking.I do n't understand what people mean by poor direction and actors , because I found this film to have excellent acting performance and a very smooth and appropriate direction.This very smart film deserves the same cult-status as Dark City , at the very least . Future will prove me right .	1
i enjoyed watching the thirteenth floor because it was a good blend of science fiction and film noir . vincent d'onofrio from law & order : criminal intent was one of a number of actors in the film having a dual role . the story is set in the 1990 's . there is a group of people at a company who made a computer generated world set in the 1930 's . one of the men employed at this company investigates his boss ' murder even though he is a suspect in the murder . there is a woman who shows up claiming to be the dead man 's daughter , even though the dead man never mentioned having a daughter , so who is she , really ? i would go into more detail but i do n't want to spoil the surprise ending to it .	1
Where do you define real ? Can you create a soul out of electronic circuits ? Are virtual people still people ? *The Thirteenth Floor* seeks to ask these questions , and provides vague answers.I 'd heard lots of bad reviews of this movie , but when I finally saw it , I did n't see why.This is actually a good , interesting movie . It takes themes from *eXistenZ* ( the fine line between what is real and what is not ) and *The Matrix* ( what if you discovered your world was n't real ? ) , mixes them , adds in a murder mystery and a love story more convincing than the one in *The Matrix* , and then tones down the special effects . If you pay attention , you may figure out much of this movie way ahead of time , as there are clues planted everywhere , but it 's still fun to watch . The 1937 world is entertaining because of its authenticity.The trailer paints this movie as being more suspenseful/action-packed than it really is . It may not be super suspenseful , but it 's entertaining , thought-provoking , and worth your time .	1
Released just a few weeks after The Matrix , this movie is constantly in it 's shadow because of the similar premise : computerized environments . However , unlike the matrix , this is a suspense/drama instead of an action movie . It is about the investigation into a murder where a programmer needs to enter the computerized world to solve the mystery . The movie is well written , and I enjoyed it very much .	1
This was a really good buy ... The story line is pretty good and it will make you laugh the entire way through ... I would recommend this one to anyone ... It 's a classic ... The story line revolves around 3 friends who end up smiling all the way until the end . Anton Tobias finds that his very own parents have been brutally murdered but the only thing he does n't understand is who did it . His 2 friends come over and help to get Anton high so that he can calm down and forget his problems and then it hits him . He was the one who murdered his parents and it was because of his Hand . It is actually possessed . Now his friends/ the police/ and anyone that he can get his HAND on will be the next target . Idle Hands are the Devils Playground so will Anton be able to keep his hands occupied long enough to not hurt anyone else or will there be more bloodshed ? The only way to know is to make the purchase and see for yourself : ) But I promise if you do you will not be disappointed . As I said earlier , This movie will have you laughing the entire way through . I would classify this movie as a Horror/Comedy but to be honest it is more of a Comedy than it is a Horror Film : ) So please pick this one up while it is still available and enjoy : ) And I would only ask that if you found this review helpful in your decision to purchase this item that you could click the button and let me know . It really does mean a lot to me to know that you guys think I wrote a good review and to know that it helped you in your decision so if you could just click the button and let me know It would mean A lot to me : ) Thanks again friend	1
I 'm really tired of popcorn movies that have no soul . Stepmom is a breath of fresh air . You know , I never realized what a good actress Julia Roberts is untilStepmom . Ed Harris is always good of course and seems to inhabit his character with all of his being . Of course he does this with all of his roles , but it 's just nice to know you can rely on him . Stepmom is about real life and real people . Give those insipid Hollywood formula films a rest and see the reason why film was invented , to explore human drama .	1
I have waited forever for a fabulous movie such as this where the stepmom is a caring parent who will go through just about anything to make things workout , yet still be witty and stick up for herself . Julia Roberts was at her best . Susan Sarandon was perfect . Whenever you hear the word & quot ; stepmom & quot ; most think & quot ; wicked & quot ; should be attached . I am a stepmom and know how painful it can get . We 're not all bad step mothers , some of us are stepmoms . This movie was very accurate and showed both sides of the fence . One reviewer said children are not aloud to act this way in real life , HA . This was a very mild case of what true step families go through . These childrens lives are being torn apart and they will stop at nothing to stop their pain . But as the movie shows , it 's not because they are bad , and the stepmom is n't bad for falling in love with their dad , and once you see through the pain there really can be peace in the end with true love and understanding . We CAN have a great relationship with one another . Wonderful show , well worth owning . It truly showed the struggle real families go through in a fun , humorous and touching way . I took my stepson to see it . It was our first date . We loved it . He laughed and cried through the whole show .	1
It is hard to believe that this film is 15 years old now : it is as fresh and refreshing as the year it was made . Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky ( written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson , Steven Rogers , Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass ) but with Chris Columbus ' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.Anna ( Jena Malone ) and Ben ( Liam Aiken ) , the two children of Jackie ( Susan Sarandon ) and Luke ( Ed Harris ) Harrison , have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father 's life : Isabel ( Julia Roberts ) , a successful photographer . She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad , but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up . But Jackie , a full-time mother , regards Isabel 's efforts as offensively insufficient . She ca n't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids . The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer , which might may be deadly for Jackie . They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.The lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show . But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family . It remains a very fine movie . Grady Harp , May 13	1
`` Stepmom '' is an arresting existential drama about the lives and times of a fragmented couple ( Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris ) with two kids . He has a fianc & eacute ; e ( Julia Roberts ) who has to deserve and then to win respect and affection from these two sensitive children whose unerring behavior is perpetual motive of comparison respect her . In order to melt this emotional iceberg , Roberts who is a successful professional photographer , will have to fight very hard to occupy her own place in the new state of things.With all these available dramatic premises , the expectations were too high . But the screenwriters bet for a tearful approach in the third movement of the play when a sudden twist of fate will intend to make us aware about the importance of the familiar values , above any serious conceptual difference between the new visitor and the original mother.The film is intense but the dramatic material promised even much more . Keeping in count the entire cast , it was a real waste .	1
Julia Roberts is becoming the stepmother of two kids who are absolutely partial about it and do not want to give her the smallest space in their life , preferring their own real mother . Divorce is not an easy matter and remarrying is even more difficult for the children . But a stepmom has to learn how to become and be a real mother , has to learn how to capture the children 's attention , interest and trust . This is done especially because the real mother has cancer and is going to die . When she realises this she stops fighting and helps the stepmom to be accepted by the kids because she has to give way to her since she is going to go and leave forever . The relation between the two mothers , the real one and the step one , is explored in great details and is very convincing . The kids are also very good and full of feeling and true emotion . The father is mostly on the sideline and certainly not the center of the film , but after all the stepmother is the star , the stepmother who is being born little by little . Emotions and feelings are uppermost in this film that becomes some entertaining and also thought bringing two hours.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University of Perpignan	1
STEPMOM is an excellent movie . It includes Julia Roberts , Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris , in this touching movie about family . Ed Harris plays Luke , who is divorced from Jackie ( Susan Sarandon ) and seeing Isabel ( Julia Roberts ) . Jackie & Luke have two kids , Ben and Anna . There is definate animosity between Jackie & Isabel , and the kids . Isabel does her best but nothing seems to be good enough for Jackie . As the movie progresses however , Jackie & Isabel bond over certain experiences . Anna who is having difficulty accepting her father 's new fiance , struggles in her every day life , but in the end learns to accept the situation . ... The movie is a touching tale about how a family comes together through crisis , and learns to live with each other again . This is definately a tear jerker , but the performances are strong all around . I highly reccomend this movie .	1
You 'll be grateful you decided to buy it if seeing it for the first time . I think about this movie and want to watch it all the time . I started watching it in my tween years and it is great ! Chemistry with the cast is great and this is one of my favorite movies with Julia Roberts , the other is Sleeping With The Enemy . But this is so much better . Great score and Chris Columbus , director of Home Alone , Harry Potter 1 & 2 's best work too . A great collaboration of everything , a masterpiece . I found myself buying the score just to reminisce the movie without the dialogue and it 's great to listen to too . Overall , one of the best movies I have yet to own on DVD . You 'll be grateful you bought this even if never seen .	1
I loved this movie . I saw it at the theatre when it first came out , and was left in the theatre once everyone else had gone trying to mop up after myself . It was so sad . The little boy broke my heart when he had his last talk with his mom ( Susan Sarandon ) . Basically , Julia Roberts and Ed Harris are an item and his ex is Sarandon . His kids do n't like Julia , Julia and Susan do n't like each other , but through predictability , a personal tragedy brings them all together ( as you can imagine ) . So apart from the predictabilitly , this is an excellent film that will make you laugh , cry and bawl . I thought it was really well acted , and do n't read those negative reviews if they did n't like this . This movie is for people with hearts .	1
Love this movie . How can it not be great with Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon ? It shows the struggle between the first wife andthe new one and how it is resolved to true friendship due to illness .	1
After seeing this movie I ran to call my mother . This is an extremely touching and moving movie . It centers around Ed Harris and Susan Sarandon , who are divorced , having to deal with the fact that Sarandon has been diagnosed cancer . In addition Julia Roberts is now about to marry Ed Harris a.k.a . the name STEP MOM.I completely enjoyed this movie . From its sadder to happier moments . I say watch with your mom .	1
Stepmom can be slated by people who do n't have a heart , but this is one of the best Julia Roberts movies out there . Ed Harris , Susan Sarandon & Julia all do extremely well in this , as do the kids . Jena Malone plays the little girl , and Liam Aiken ( Object Of My Affection , Sweet November ) plays her younger brother.I have to say this movie makes me cry every single time . And once you 've seen the movie once , you 'll start crying earlier & earlier in the movie each time . It 's amazing.Julia & Susan work so well on this film together , that I ca n't imagine anyone else in their roles . Their love/hate relationship is so good , you actually believe it . The cold stares ( something Susan 's fabulous at ! ) make you shiver . And the crying , god , as soon as they start , that 's me . Watch out for the conversation about the wedding , if that does n't get you going nothing will.This is a truly excellent film , and I 'm not going to ruin it anymore for anyone who has n't seen it . Just make sure the tissues are filled up , and you 're either wearing waterproof mascara or none at all .	1
The film 's story is one that , for the most part , is unfortunately far too engrained in our society today . But this is still a great movie as its leads bring their characters to life on the screen , allowing us to sympathize with their troubles ... and perhaps choose sides in their disagreements . Susan Sarandon , Ed Harris , and Julia Roberts are involved in a triangle as they work to adjust to one couple 's divorce and the other 's pending nuptials . The child actors , Jena Malone and Liam Aiken , were also great as the kids not happy with any part of the situations . These kids were given distinct personalities and each one made the absolute most with what they had ... job well done . Sure , the ending was totally sad and corny all at once , but it worked so well that I wo n't complain ... instead , I 'll credit the cast for making it work so well . A fine film for viewing , though some might recommend a box of tissues . Enjoy .	1
I actually got this DVD , plus four others , for free ! It was part of a special deal that I got with the purchase of my Toshiba DVD player . It sat around my house for a few months before I finally opened it and played it . I had been a little reluctant to see it because , even though it stars one of my favorite actresses -- Susan Sarandon , it looked like a stereotypical oversentimentalized `` chick flick . '' I was pleasantly surprised.There is not one false note in this movie . The screenplay , courtesy of a whopping FIVE writers ( which usually spells disaster for most movies ) , sticks very close to reality . We get a sense that these characters are three-dimensional and REAL , and not merely functions of the plot . The tension between the estranged wife ( played by Sarandon ) and the title character ( played by Julia Roberts ) is palpable and believable , with no one being made the saint nor the villian . These characters have virtues and faults just like anybody else . They also have clear reasons and MOTIVATIONS for the way they feel , and for the things they do . Ed Harris , as the man standing between the woman he loves and the woman he once loved ( and still cares very much for ) , also rings true in his performance and makes us feel the inner tensions felt by his character . I even liked the two young actors playing the kids , and the way their parts were written : these are real kids with real feelings and emotions , and are not just there to look and act cute . They are caught in an uncomfortable situation not of their making , and we really feel for them.Although the last half-hour does reflect certain conventions of Hollywood dramas ( `` Terms of Endearment '' comes to mind , a little bit anyway ) , STEPMOM never falls into cliche ` territory . It deals with the situation bravely , and does n't lose its step . By the end of the film , I felt like I knew these characters and cared about them , because they contained aspects of real people I have known.Basically , if you like to watch a good family-centered drama every once in a while , then I definitely recommend this movie . It is definitely better than most others of its type .	1
This was a wonderful movie . It was very realistic . There were very touching moments as well as sad ones . It held my attention the entire time . I definitely recommend it .	1
While Stepmom is a PG-13 film , it does indeed have a good message.After loved ones pass they 're truly never gone.I watched this in my & # 34 ; Family Living & Parenthood & # 34 ; class senior year , and it was my first time seeing it.Julia Roberts is great in the role of the younger , sexy girlfriend , and Susan Sarandon ( like always ) is wonderful in her role as the jealous mother.Overall , I recommend Stepmom for anyone who is nearing their teenage years .	1
What a fantastic film . Brian Gibson directed this homage to 70s rock and roll that took me throught the whole range of emotions and left me with that happy satisfied feeling I adore.Smack full of great performances , good music , and a herd of sheep , Still Crazy entertains as well as reminds us all just how fun rock and roll can be.Its about music , bands , forgiveness , and friends.Its about hanging on for dear life and letting go.Its fresh , its funny , and it 'll warm your heart.Featuring the music of Mick Jones ( Foreigner ) and Chris Difford ( Squeeze ) , the film chronicles the reunion tour of near-miss British rock band Strange Fruit and all that comes with it . Tiny clubs , bad hair days , crazy fans , love affairs , and the music that holds them all together.If you liked Almost Famous or ever had a heart for bands , you will love this movie .	1
Well , not for a few more years . I always liked Rob Reiner 's This is Spinal Tap , but after discovering this seldom heard of little jem a few years back , this is my favorite fictional work about a band . Strange Fruit live up to their name tenfold . They exemplify every once great 70s band ( well , in their case , near great ) that fell apart due to egos , drugs , death , and all the other trappings that come with any modicum of success.20 years later , desperate for cash and all lost in their own ways , they reunite to play clubs in Europe so they can headline once again at the very place where they split up . This movie is sensitive and funny , bypassing some of the direct meanness of Tap , and you actually come to care for each of these characters . Stephen Rea is always great in every movie I 've seen him in , but here he is more or less the keyboard playing glue that keeps the band together . Timothy Spall is hilarious as Beano , sarcastic , flatulent , and idiotic by turns . Jimmy Nail as Les is particularly grabbing in his jealousy as he is bypassed for another singer after the original , Keith Lovell , died of an overdose . It 's been said before , but it must be said again : Bill Nighy as insecure , aging , dopey and lovable lead vocalist Ray Simms steals every single scene he 's in . Hell , he does that in EVERY movie I 've seen him in , and that is a definite compliment . He also has a pretty great singing voice to boot.Songs are penned by Foreigner 's Mick Jones and Squeeze 's Chris Difford for a great and fitting soundtrack . This movie is fun , moving , and it will make you glad you appreciate classic rock even more than you may right now . With obvious nods to British greats like Zeppelin , Uriah Heep , and Pink Floyd with a strong resemblance to Syd Barrett in Brian Lovell 's case , there 's not much you ca n't love about this flick . We 're all getting older , so it 's that much more endearing , and we can definitely relate . Our rockers got old with us , and this movie captures that in the best and uplifting of all lights . Put this one in your DVD player and enjoy . No matter how many times you watch it , you may find that the flame still burns .	1
While `` Spinal Tap '' is also a great satirical movie about the dynamics of `` Old Rockers '' , it is more in the vein of venues such as `` Best of Show , `` A Mighty Wind '' , etc.On the other hand `` Still Crazy '' is a very believable as well as moving story about the possible , perhaps probable , outcome of once famous rock groups `` as time inexorably goes by '' . Overall , great acting . The movie 's music is very good and Once the band gets back in their groove the music track becomes outstanding.The one sub-plot of the movie that should have been omitted is the crazed groupie chasing after the drummer . Possible , perhaps , probable , unlikely . Regardless , this `` aside '' did distract from an otherwise great story line . If you like rock you 've got to see the last `` jump to '' scene of the movie . I guarantee it will give you chills ! ! On another note , as others have posted , although Amazon lists this movie as widescreen IT IS NOT WIDESCREEN ! ! Yes , I should have read the reviews more carefully before purchasing , but as someone else pointed out the movie is great entertainment for $ 10 ! ! I do wonder why Amazon does n't correct this error in their listing as people should not have to scour every review of the product for these type of `` gotchas '' . In reviewing the DVD details on IMDB it appears that the only way to get a widescreen version of this movie is to buy a region 2 copy and of course that would require a region free player here in the US . Having the widescreen format would have made a great movie even better .	1
Favorite movie of 1999 - Sixth Sense . Favorite video rental of 1999 - Still Crazy.This movie is a pure joy . This is not a & quot ; mockumentary & quot ; like Spinal Tap ( one of my all-time favorites ) , but rather a fairly straightforward comedy about a 60s/70s British rock band trying to make a comeback . The & quot ; Ray & quot ; character is sympathetic and hilarious at the same time ... a wonderful character.The performances are outstanding , the comedy sometimes subtle , sometimes broad , and the music is awesome ( I own the soundtrack and would highly recommend it to anyone , even people who have n't seen the movie ) .My wife and I watched the movie 3 times in one month ... that 's how much we enjoyed it.So , when 's Strange Fruit coming to town !	1
This is like the only third foreign movie I 've seen and from then on , I became a foreign film addict . Movies this good should be released not only in its home country but everywhere in the world . I 've been reading the reviews of a lot of people for this movie and I find mixed reactions but generally , everyone loved the great performances , wonderful story , perfect setting and the mood it created to achieve that melodramatic audience appeal.It is a very simple yet very touching movie . It will definitely touch that soft spot in your heart . I am proud to have a Central Station DVD on my collection . This is definitely one of the best and very much recommended film .	1
Central Station is the first movie to have make me cry in years . It tells the story of Dora , a bitter woman who gets paid for writting letters for people at the train station but afterwords does n't care enough to send them to their receivers . Right after leaving the station , a woman to whom she just offered her services gets killed in an accident leaving her little son Josue all alone with nowone to support him . Dora , under the certain circumanstances , choses to take the kid under her wing and takes a long trip with him in order to find his father . During their harsh journey we have the chance to see the many faces of Brazil : the religious one ( in a small village people are praying for their sins ) , the humane one ( Dora 's slow change from cold and self-centered to sensitive and caring ) , the inhumane and dark one ( initialy some people try to use Josue as a source of human organs for sale ) . Fernanda Montenegro gives the best female perfomance of that year while being perfectly paired with child-actor Vinicious de Oliveira . The final part of the film is full of genuin human emotion . It 's one of these endings you never want to end .	1
I had always thought that U.S. writers would stick to the roadtrip ( e.g. , & quot ; On the Road & quot ; ) and the Latins would stick to magical realism . I 've been happily surprised by the results of their poaching on the American genre . Recently I watched & quot ; Y Tu Mama Tambien & quot ; and found it excellent . Like YTMT , & quot ; Central Station & quot ; is cut in the classic mold of the roadtrip , where transformation flows from the trip itself and the characters met on it . This movie come highly recommended . Its only detraction is the ending , which could have occurred in any of the last three scenes and which was a little too melodramatic .	1
It seems to me that foreign films in recent years have seen more than their fair share of stories in which a crusty old person bonds with some cute kid . Of course you can trace this plot way past & quot ; Cinema Paradiso & quot ; back to Chaplin in & quot ; The Kid , & quot ; so it is certainly a tried and true tale to be told . Which makes films like & quot ; Central Station & quot ; all the more remarkable because you would think this mine had been played out long ago . This Brazilian film by director Walter Salles offers the exquisite Fernanda Montenegro , who richly deserved an Oscar nomination . Her character is Dora , a barren soul who makes her money by writing letters for illiterates in Rio de Janeiro 's Central Station . Dora reads the letters to her roommate and then throws them away . But then she meets Josue , played by Vinicius de Oliveira , a nine-year-old boy whose mother has just died . Circumstances are contrived by which Dora takes Josue on a bus trip to return him to his father . This fateful journey does not consist of big confrontations but small moments , each of which begins to peck away at Dora 's cold exterior . Perhaps the greatest testament to this performance is to simply point out that the cute kid never really manages to steal a scene away from Montenegro . More than anyone else , she elevates & quot ; Central Station & quot ; to its heights .	1
Possibly the best foreign film to come out of Brazil since the days of & quot ; Pixote , & quot ; and & quot ; Black Orpheus , & quot ; & quot ; Central Station & quot ; is a heartbreaking account of a retired school teacher who befriends a recently-orphaned boy at Rio de Janiero 's bus terminal . Fernanda Montenegro is fabulous as Dora , a single woman who lives her life for herself . Vincius de Oliveira , who plays Josue , is amazing in his first starring role . Personally , I feel that Montenegro was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar due to Gwyneth Paltrow 's popularity that year , and it is a tragedy , for her performance is powerful . The film was also robbed of the Best Foreign Language Oscar due to Roberto Benigni 's annoying antics and Miramax 's powerful lobbying . The film which takes you from the beautiful Braganza-era buildings of Rio to the Brazilian hinterlands is like a dream . The vastness and beauty of Brazil and its ' inhabitants are covered with sensitivity and grace by director Walter Salles . It was refreshing to see many of Brazil 's sprawling developments , many which were created by the militry junta that ruled the country from the 1960 's to 1980 's due to lower density rates in major costal cities and to protect the country 's borders from communist insurgents in the Guianas . If you need a good tearjerker in the tradition of the Color Purple , please see this masterpiece .	1
Very few times does a movie get as deep as & quot ; Central Station & quot ; is able to get . From the very beginning you feel that it is going to grab you , and it 's not hard to let the tears roll by at so many point throughout the movie.Fernanda Montenegro 's performance is awesome , but we 're accostumed to her doing this . However , the kid is as natural as one can get . It 's hard not to feel for him what the woman in the movie felt ... Also , it should be noted that the photography was simply extraordinary ! Beautiful shots that are complemented with some great acting and equally beautiful music , under a great direction.In short , a classic before our eyes . You wo n't regret buying it !	1
Poignant story of a lost little boy trying to find his Father at a busy Brazilian train station . Although not a perfect film , the characters portrayed give such honest performances that you do tend to overlook the implausibilties of the narrative . For example , why would a crusty and jaded old woman travel across the country for a boy she hardly knows ? Still , 'Central Station ' seems to be a film that plays from the heart and to it 's credit , the schmaltz factor is n't over-played ( at least not as much as it could have been ) . Fernanda Montenegro wins you over slowly as Dora while the little boy Josua ( Vin & iacute ; cius de Oliveira ) is so stubborn and determined that you ca n't help but want him to find his Father . Oh , plus there 's gorgeous scenery , too . Just do n't expect 'Central Station ' to be a glossy Hollywood tear-jerker .	1
An emotionally spellbinding masterpiece is what we have here . Everything about this film adds up to give us a film that is beyond your average tear jerker , it is an unforgettable story about what it means to be human . It is about priorities , family and the concsiounce ( sorry , I need spellcheck ) .Get the plot gist from other reviewers , I 'd just like to throw in my 2 cents and let all who care to read how wonderful this film is .	1
8mm is a dour and depressing outing , but that does n't stop it from being a good , well made , enjoyable thriller . ( dour , depressing and enjoyable ... Yes , as strange as that sounds ) You might never crack a smile , but you should enjoy seeing Nick deal out his own brand of harsh justice.James Gandolfini plays a his Vicious Brute role once again , and very well . Peter Stormare seems to have the only on-screen fun as a bizarre director and Joaquin Pheonix is Sympathetic and Likeable as a Adult Bookshop Clerk who Introduces Nick to Hollywoods Grittier Side . Catherine Keener is a little Underused as Nicks Neglected wife and The man himself , Big Nicky , gets by with alot of Wrinkle-brow looks and Teary-eyed Expressions , but in the third act , he losses his grip ( mentally , not performance wise ) and his real acting skills shine.Overall , it 's Definately not for all tastes . But for those with a high tolerence and a strong stomach , It 's well worth a viewing .	1
This movie is deffinitely in my top ten of all time.Nicolas Cage is hired to investigate the making of a porn video but it just turns into so much more.The characters all just seem so real and believable , special effects are excellent , and has the most gripping story line in a movie since The Crow.I cant talk a lot about the storyline without giving something away , so i wont try to , but trust me its excellent and if you buy this movie you wont be dissapointed , efinitely watchable more than once.Action , suspense , you name it 8mm has it , and thsi is the best Cage has been in a movie i think .	1
This is one of my favorite movies . When I think about it , the first words I associate are dark and down . Dark is the color of the actual film . Dark is the descent to unexposed recesses of men . Dark is the degradation of a man through exposure to the residents of these caverns ; secret societies that live out our nightmares . Secret societies that live out the dirtiest fantasies , we have and never would dare tell a soul . This is the ride of the protagonist . The downward spiral he forces himself into , and at the end regrets.Shumacher , seems to have a knack for psychological downward spirals . He gave us before , `` Falling down '' with Michael Douglas . `` When you dance with the devil , the devil does n't change ... the devil changes you '' This phrase given by Max ( Joaquin Phoenix ) is metaphoric to the whole story.First off , I 'll address the easy equation with `` Thesis '' the Spanish film . Not because both films use one subject , Snuff films , one is a rip off of the other or even inspired from.8MM is a psychological thriller . It is an exploration of the most sinister side of the human . And what happens to an average guy when exposed to the chaotic and insane , and discovers he has an inclination to them , gets desensitized , or reacts out of character . Shumacher intends to drive you down alongside the character , so you see what he sees and feel what he feels , and find out how `` normal '' you are.Tom Wells is a normal guy . He has a beautiful family , striving to solidify their economical position in the upper middle class . Tom has one vice , smoking and hides it from his wife . He is a surveillance expert , and his last job is the story of the movie.A recently death industrial czar had a vice and hided it from his wife of 50 years.The wife wants to explore all the truth into the man 's vice , and commissions Wells to dig into it , especially investigate if someone was hurt by it.Some evil and injustice , are so overwhelming to one 's sensitivity that rage overrides and leads to unwanted actions that scar . Acts so far out ominous that you are forced to react and create some balance to give some overall sense . But instead of gaining some peace from this , you sprout a hate hungry monster that can not be turned off . Carrying its bitter taste to everyday life . Well 's investigation leads him to this kind of path . And he is forced to react instinctively and then cover up the mess.Again Max 's words of caution : `` there are things you 'll see that can not be unseen '' , are encompassing of this journey.Finally , It 's all about self-discovery . And through Shumacher 's world and Cage 's performance you get to live the abrasive , seedy journey , including its controversial choices.They truly seem far more difficult to make than out of context.Is violence and revenge in some unique occasions justifiable ? . At least within the window of your emotional stability ? Are there actions you can not be a bystander to , although the consequences might be devastating ? Is there guilt in the pleasure of punishing those whom , on your mind unquestionably deserve it ? How high is the price to pay for that pleasure ? Those are the questions you might notice become more puzzling at the end .	1
Cage and Schumacher examine in horrifying and brilliant detail what motivates people to do or become evil , what overcomes evil , and what evil does to the good , the nave , and the ill-prepared . Yes , it could have been a little less ponderous and a little more compact , but that hardly is a blemish in this movie . If you 're looking for cartoonish , stylized morality plays , go see a movie like `` Fatal Attraction , '' cuz this ai n't it . This movie has a theme more in common with `` Rope '' and a sick , moody grittiness worthy of `` Seven . '' Speaking of those movies , this movie reeks with the consequences of the philosophy of hedonism and nihilism , but does not wallow in this philosophy but instead uses them as a foil for the primacy of justice and retribution , both of which are ultimately delivered in a fashion worthy of James Dickey .	1
An interesting choice for Nicolas Cage , but he and Joaquin Phoenix are great in this film . A little disturbing , a great but twisted plot .	1
American people should be proud of this film , the courage of showing such a disgusting subject and not only the courage of producers , but the actors and the director are equally courageous . Why I said that American people should be proud of this film , unfortunately United States are the greatest producer of pornography and all kind of pornography of the whole world , in Miami for example white americans get men from Africa and countries like Cuba and put them to make sex with `` barely legal white american girls '' creating tons and tons of sexual sites that are a direct offense to American families and to American history , someone should do something immediately , maybe CIA or FBI , someone , so this film is an alert to American people of what 's been happening nowadays , thank you Nicolas Cage , sometimes is necessary to show things even when it is not what we want to see . It is necessary to recover the moral values of the founding fathers .	1
This is a movie that has alot of suspence and fear . Some parts might make you think that the director was sick or something . But for some people out there who like suspence and gore , this is the movie for you .	1
When this film was release in theatres i was very skeptical to see this movie but one day.. I decided to go and see it WOW ! .. This film is certainly not for everyone yes it is dark , gritty , perverted , twisted , demented . Just reading the reviews i can see that alot of the reviewers are missing the point .. That was the intentions of this film we cant be naive dont think that this isnt what 's going on in a sick sub-culture such as porno.. My hat off to the director he knew he was taking a big chance in doing this type of film it was a very bold move to even consider..The film just takes a brutual look at this culture any young person female or male even have thoughts about going this route think again if you seen this picture ..Like i said I recommend it if you can stomach it.. This isnt certainly everyone 's type of movie	1
This movie is about patients in a psychiatric hospital during the 1960 's . The movie ties in very well with actual news scenes from the 1960 's . Dramatic , funny , and sad ... all in one . EVERYBODY in this movie should have won some kind of award .	1
James Mangold 's Girl , Interrupted is so moving and thought-provoking that it 's scary . Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie are pure gold in their performances here . Even Brittany Murphy is completely frigthening as Daisy , a young patient with anorexia who 's `` addicted '' to her dad 's chicken . James Mangold is a great director , he also directed Identity , Copland , Kate and Leopold , and the most recent , Walk the Line . I love everyting about this film , great set design , terrific script , and the film is based on a true story . My favorite scene is when Lisa ( Jolie ) confronts Daisy in her house . Jolie received a best supporting oscar but she is practically in this film as much as Ryder 's character , Suzanna Kaysen . Ryder is a tremendous and i was very disappointed she did not get a nomination for best actress . Suzanna attempts suicide and is placed in a woman 's ward for the mentally disturbed , along the way she becomes friends with many of her fellow patients , a soicopath , a burn victim , a couple of anorexics , and a pathological liar played elegantly by Clea Duvall . Suzanna is diagnosed with a boderline personality disorder , as she tries to understand her disorder she learns to trust others and herself , and must find a way to do what she has dreamed of doing her whole life and that is to be a writer . Girl , Interrupted is gutsy , real , and heartbreakingly sad . I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves dramas .	1
While I normally would not have picked to watch this type of & quot ; chick flick & quot ; on my own , circumstances lead to me watching this movie and I was n't disappointed . I recognized instantly that Jolie had stolen the show and was n't surprised at all later when she won an Oscar for her performance . I am a fan of Ryder and she does not disappoint here at all , but Jolie really nailed her character.For those that enjoyed her performance here , check out the movie Gia . It is another outstanding job by Jolie ( before she became & quot ; famous & quot ; ) .I give a strong recommendation for this movie , even to fellow guys that really would rather watch action filled guy movies , this movie is entertaining and thought provoking as well as featuring excellent acting .	1
Unlike other films involving mental illness , & quot ; Girl Interrupted & quot ; treats its subject matter in an intelligent and non-manipulative fashion . The fact that the film maker and cast did not try to exploit every cheap device that they could from the fact that most of the characters were in a mental institution made this film powerful and believable . Although & quot ; Girl Interrupted & quot ; takes place in a mental institution and contains mentally ill characters , the problems and issues it raises are universal and apply to the mentally fit as well . To one extent or another , almost all of the patients in this film possess a core of sanity and rational behavior . For this reason , they can evaluate their situations and improve upon them like any one else.The film also contains wonderful humor and drama . The climactic confrontation between Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder at first appears to be another chase scene out of a cheap thriller when in fact it is a battle of wits and a measure of perception . In the end this film contains no villains ( although it has its share of villainous acts ) , but it has many silent , struggling heroes.Winona Ryder and Woopie Goldberg provide absolutely solid performances . I thought Winona was going to play a sweet , weepy , mental patient that slept around a lot , but her character contained extraordinary and subtle depth . My compliments to her . Angelina Jolie 's character was larger than life , but this fits the context of the film.I really thought I was n't going to like this movie but it was great . Check it out .	1
I watched this film again last night with my wife ( her first time ) and upon the second go through I appreciated the film for much more than I felt the first go through . I will openly admit that the first watching was for a glimpse Jolie 's beauty , and her role in this film somehwat prohibits that . Watching for the second time , this time around for the pure acting and or story line and theres much more to report . If ever an actress deserved an award more than Jolie here please let me know . She NAILED her performance in everyway , outshining Ryder by a long shot and proving that she is by far one of the most talented leading ladies around . Lisa ( Jolie 's charactor ) is the most interesting person on screen , her soul is captured by Jolie 's passion for her art here and you feel attached to her , just as Susanna ( Ryder ) is throughout this film ... The film is actually someone mellow-dramatic when Jolie is not around . This film has an air of sadness about it as you see these girls and how their lives are destroyed by their illnesses ... a young girl with burn scares almost brought me to tears when she 's crying and screaming about being ugly ... and when Ryder and Jolie sing her to sleep ... it 's heart breaking ... as is one of the final scenes when Ryder confronts Jolie with her true feelings . This is a great film that should n't be missed , and is full of great performances by actresses that do n't deliver normally like Brittney Murphy who soars in her performance here . A note , kinda humourous actually , but in the beginning when Ryder is talking she asks if you 've ever stolen something when you had the money ... HA , she did ! ! ! !	1
I do n't usually watch the Oscar 's because for many years , people and movies I expect to win , never do . So , when I see a DVD that has & quot ; Oscar nominee & quot ; or & quot ; Academy Award Winner & quot ; and even & quot ; One of the best films of the year ! & quot ; on the covers , I tend to say.. & quot ; yeah , right ! Whatever ... & quot ; I purchased the DVD of & quot ; GIRL , INTERRUPTED & quot ; and one of the driving forces for me to buy this is for the acting of Winona Ryder ( watch her eyes because those emotions are within the eyes ) and Angelina Jolie that is currently the eye candy for many entertainment magazines at this time.After watching this movie , I must say that I was actually very pleased with the storyline . It 's actually a very good story and the interaction among the girls was really interesting . James Mangold said in the director 's commentary that it was about adding conflict and the conflicts between Susanna and Lisa or Susanna and her nurse and of course Susanna with Susanna is very well done.Winona Ryder is a talented actress and again her eyes play a big part in this movie . In fact , the HBO First Look : & quot ; The Making of GIRL , INTERRUPTED & quot ; goes into that . As for Angelina Jolie , she did a perfect job in playing Lisa . With all the rumors and news going around , sometimes I wonder if Angelina and Lisa share anything in common . She deserves the Academy Award for playing a convincing sociopath.The video quality of the movie is pretty good but there are noticeable artifacts during the dark scenes . The audio is good and you do n't get so much because it 's a dialogue driven movie . I think the only time I heard sounds from the speakers is when they rode on the VW van and you hear the engine.What about the extras ? Well , first , let 's be thankful they made it anamorphic and they included the director 's commentary , deleted scenes and an isolated music score . The HBO making of is very interesting to watch and the theatrical trailers for Winona and Angelina 's movies were a nice touch.So , overall you get a pretty good DVD with a pretty good story . Some might deem this as more of a movie more for women but I think both genders can enjoy this movie . It has a nice blend of drama , comedy and a few dark moments . Check it out !	1
This movie really hits home on what people go through when they are trying to figure out their borderline personality disorder . Winona Ryder plays a great part as does Angelina Jolie . A must see ! !	1
Well ( cough , hack ) for anyone 's who 's spent some time in a locked ward , you may need to put the DVD down the first time , as I did . But make sure you pick up back up , for the wonderful performances of Ryder , Redgrave , Goldberg and especially the star-turn that is Angelina Jolie 's ( & quot ; good to know & quot ; ! ) . The commentary track by the director is well worth the time too . My biggest quibble with the film ( aside from the goopy , sentimental goodbye scenes at the end ) is that Ryder 's character is awfully , um , mild as personality disorders go ( are we supposed to think that she 's been put in this place by mistake ? Okay , she swallowed some aspirin and vodka , and had sex a couple of days in a day , but trust me , Ryder is a Girl Scout compared to most people with Borderline Personality Disorder which these days is a very specific and detailed diagnosis . Perhaps this diagnosis was just a catch-all back in the 60s , for people having kind of a bad day ? ) . Mangold , in his heartfelt commentary track , points out many things which you 'll be feeling yourself ( all in a good way ) when you first watch the film -- the center of gravity that is Goldberg , the enormous expressiveness of Ryder and her luminous eyes , the homage of sorts to Michael Powell 's Black Narcissus , and especially , how wonderful it is to watch a film where the director takes time to let things happen and does n't edit the whole thing into four second cuts .	1
This movie , based on the book by this same name , is the author 's true story . Suffering from relatively normal teenage angst during the turbulent 1960s , Susanna ( Ryder ) is committed to a mental institution where she is surrounded by truly mentally ill patients . She is at first terrified by , then becomes friends with , Lisa ( Jolie ) , a true sociopath . It is Lisa 's behavior that gradually makes Susanna realize she has to work out her problems if she ever wants to be free . Excellent movie !	1
great cast . great acting . interesting story . it 's one of those movies that you could watch a hundred times and still want to see it again . great movie .	1
This movie is set in an 1960 's Mental Institution and stars Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie . The other memebersof this cast consist of a Compulsive Liar , A Self Mutilator , a Lesbian , a Girl With A Secret and an Anorexic . These woman actually all look pretty normal comparedwith some of the women I 've dated over the past few years . What I really want to know is how come Winona 's character Susanna is n't being treated for Anorexia Nervosa instead of Depression ? If you have the answer to this puzzle please Email me . I give this movie 5 stars becauseI kind of like Angelina Jolie.I 'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing ?	1
This film is the best of the year , bar none . The performances are incredible , especially by the overlooked Ryder who is as good as I 've ever seen her . She let her eyes do the talking much of the time . Jolie , of course , is a charismatic sociopath . It is hard to have sympathy for Lisa because of the nature of her actions ( towards Daisy , especially ) , but she is ultimately a sympathetic character because she is so confused . As the Nurse Whoopi says , Lisa thinks insanity helps her see the truth , a sad , though common conception . The movie shows that the best option is to live life and not be caught up in the & quot ; romantic & quot ; nature of madness . Because of this original , compelling theme , the film is incredibly uplifting . Clea Duvall is adorable as Susanna 's & quot ; Wizard & quot ; loving roommate . All of the girls give strong performances and give us a glimpse of their flawed humanity . The score is also excellent as well as the soundtrack that perfectly underscores the film ( I knew the movie would be great when I heard the first notes of & quot ; Bookends & quot ; ) . I whole-heartedly recommend this film .	1
There are some very powerful performances by the leading ladies and there is a compelling story line . The characters are not 2-dimensional , but real people .	1
Angelina 's character is named Lisa which is also my name . I can relate to her , but not to the psychopathic extremes . Great movie and all the actors are great !	1
Winona Ryder gives an very fine performance as Susanna Kaysen , a 18 year old teenager , enrolls herself in a mental institution to better the problems , she has been thought . Then she meets all the trouble young and older female in the ward but she fascinate by the resident bad-girl sociapath named Lisa ( Strongly played by Angelina Jolie ) gives her a new life and a strange friendship with mental patient but Lisa has more problems than any of woman there . James Mangold did well directing the film and a well writing screenplay by Suzanne Grant ( Erin Brockovich , 28 Days ) . Also Whoopi Goldberg as the nurse valerie does gives one of her best roles . The film has a flew flaws is a bit long , Ryder is a bit unconvincing as a teenager but still well acted drama . Grade : A- .	1
The psychiatrist said , `` It 's not uncommon ... it happens to a lot of young women . '' And then diagnosed the young ( female ) patient with a `` borderline '' personality disorder . What that means is `` she does n't seem right '' ; `` she 's not getting it '' -- and that means the young woman was brought up among people with 'resources ' and she is not doing everything according to their cultural ethos so her parents will have `` bragging rights '' about what university she will attend , which would mean they were great parents ( which , in essence they were ) but they , as parents would worry about that -- all parents did during this period : with 'means ' or not ) , because there is this factor that her failure to adhere to the cultural'tracts ' and expectations means that a reflection falls upon the parents and affects their status in their local community and society . Such was the culture during this period . Parents were totally concerned about their reputations in the community -- It means and meant an awful lot . And still today , but then , during this period , it was an obsession with parents . People killed to save their reputation and status : checkout `` Perry Mason '' . Parents were very serious about `` loosing face . '' And often their children would embarass them in a timeless teen rebellion . As a last-ditched effort the parents who could afford it sent their children to a sanotorium , other parents set them out into their own independent lives.It is obvioius by the characters that some of these young women wanted to step out of the proverbial box and go it on their own and that caused them problems inside . They felt 'wrong ' and their parents and community supported that sense of wrong , but at the same time they felt 'right ' for themselves ; they found they could not comply with the collective sense that was in place for proper development : `` Just do as you 're told and you 'll be fine , '' but it caused problems inside . It caused confusion , agitation , resistance and depression and it is very hard to get through this in your young life and make it to the other side where light and life is for you.For a young woman to say she wanted to 'write ' without getting a college degree or without getting married first was defined as being 'unfavorable ' and more like a 'bum ' but today we invite writing careers because sometimes they take off into lucrative careers . Today , women pick and choose when to get married , when to have children and how many , all such as that , but still : SOME young women will have a really hard time , a really serious `` mind jam '' and ca n't get on with their life . ( Well , young men too ... everybody gets jammed at middleaged ; so we all go through brain jams that are difficult to get by and live through but they are more natural than crazy : some of us experienced people say . ) Afterall , 'crazy ' means you 're not mentally compatible with everyone else.In the meantime , life is going on and more events happen that sometimes does something like `` shock therapy '' and `` we wake up to smell the coffee '' eventually ; by then we may be fifty or sixty . We awaken to the fact that life is not something we can really change or design to our liking directly ; this is other life going on that we can not controll . It is something that we may be able to 'structure ' , 'order ' and 'manage ' to a certain extent but we still have to live through it to the other side.Then , there were young women in the sanotorium in this movie who were basically 'kids ' and would remain basically kids for all their lives ; they trade their parents for caretakers in a luxury sanotorium . Independence and 'be strong and face the world ' is a bunch of crap , their minds might say . I prefer to just sit here and be here and not have to deal with people and their criticisms . I 'll be a criticism . But some parents ca n't afford a luxury sanotorium , Whoopi 's character tells one of the patients.I liked that line a lot : `` It happens to a lot of young women '' ... .it may just happen to all young people . Growing up is hard to do : getting reality straight and feeling our drives pushing us and desiring what we should n't have ( all of that ) and having dreams and wishes in the mind and not realizing what to do with them ... all of that is very difficult to get through and learn but most of us eventually do it.It takes quite a bit of adjusting ( in stages ) to live adult life in a 'real sense ' and by the time a young woman does get her bearings she may have had some traumatic events early on that she ca n't take back , she ca n't erase , that has ruined her 'perfect ' life ... and so on , but then , for her to get well she has to keep going and learn hardcore that there is no such thing as a perfect life where people do n't die from just about anything , and there is no such thing as perfect people that will not break rules , and , lie and cheat , and that their own life and living is not so broken , not as broken ... as it seems to be because 'normal ' is a wide field of gray ; it is the formulaic structure , plan and goal for the IDEAL life that gets in the way.Real life is very hard to take if you 're a stark idealist . And an ideal life is hard to take if you prone to more realism.I think this movie is an American classic in many ways . It is right on . The characters are so believable . ( And no , Angelina Jolie does not over-act . She places the role . Without her performance we would not have felt we were in a mental ward in an upper income sanotorium . Like Whoopi Goldberg 's character said , `` I 've worked at the public institutions ... '' Bravo for the performances ! ! ! Suggestion : Give this to a troubled young girl before she goes off the edge . Show her what the edge really looks like . And do n't think the real-life nurses do not know when you 're not taking the pills , they do . They may just feel that their job requirement is to give you the pill and not too much else . But , the young people in the sanotorium do feel that when they hurt themselves deliberately they are hurting someone else. -- MO	1
This movie was supposed to be a sort of comeback for Winona Ryder , after several years of a career lull , who produced and starred in this film . It turned into the break through performance for Angelina Jolie , who got the praise for the sociopathic Lisa that culminated into an Academy Award ( her pre Brangelina life ) . Aside from this hype and the unexpected shift of attention , this is a movie that makes you think.Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen , who was hospitalized for a year in a psychiatric hospital after attempting suicide at age 18 . While in the hospital , she meets other patients and lives the life of an institutionalized `` crazy person '' . TV , popping pills , playing games , writing , smoking cigarettes , sleeping , talking to nurses and doctors , etc . There are some wonderful moments of humor ( the ice cream shop trip ) , horrifying scenes ( screaming and fighting ) , and a few moments of friendship and bonding . Even in this terrible place they can find some common ground and become friendly.What does this tell us ? Is it just a hilarious portrayal of people who can not cope ? Is it a sad profile of people who can not function in the outside world ? It 's more than that . It 's a story about being shattered on the inside and repairing yourself . Susanna was able to put the pieces back together and reenter society while Lisa and Polly and Georgianna and the others were not able to do it . Lisa is the one in command , she is so sociopathic and evil that she has no consideration for others save for herself . There is more to life than what is going on within you and your problems , but when those problems overcome you , you sometimes fall apart.When someone insulted me once , I came back at them with the same rant that Lisa did in the ice cream shop . `` Hey lady , he 's a tip for you . Do n't point your finger at CRAZY PEOPLE ! ! ! '' She backed off instantly and walked off . I won .	1
I enjoyed Girl interrupted.The HD presentation is excellent/but I will not pay to own it in HD digitally.Time fore Sony pictures to finally release this wonderful film on Blu-Ray.In the mean time.I bough it again on DVD .	1
It shows how one could really be influenced by others ... . Also shows how ECT can be misused and abused . Wonder where Lisa gets funding to come and go ?	1
5 star cast movie that sucks you right in . One of the very few movies I can watch over and over again	1
I 'll be honest the only reason I watched this was because I saw an adequately funny gif online and thought why not when I saw it on Netflix the next day . I was pleasantly surprised with what I found considering all I knew about this movie was that some girl did n't know where her aorta was.Girl , Interrupted is the tale of a Borderline ( No one knows what this means ) woman goes to psychiatric ward , in the 50 's . Thankfully this story is not just about Susanna , it 's about the other girls in the ward , and watching them heal or just finding out why they 're there . Its about finding out that some scars never heal , they only hurt worse everyday . And some of us are already dead on the inside.There were a few unbelievable bits to this movie , like how wards are managed . Then again this is based in 50 's so things might have been run differently back then . Still I found some of it unbelievable.I loved watching Susanna grow out of her disease even though she never fully understood what it was , just that she was n't normal . Plus this movie does not hold back on real problems ( Prostituting , incest , and being promiscuous ) , and they even let there language flow free the entire movie , which is refreshing .	1
I absolutely loved Sylvia Plath 's The Bell Jar , and this movie is set within McLean Psychiatric Hospital , the same hospital Sylvia Plath sojourned in during the 1950s . So , I was predisposed to like , if not love , this movie . Yet my overall impression was mixed , fairly positive , but more lukewarm than I had anticipated . I did like many aspects of the movie : top-notch acting ; the theme that we are all somewhat borderline ( like Susanna 's diagnosis ) , a spectrum of dysfunctionality in a dysfunctional world ; some of Susanna 's insights ; Whoopi Goldberg 's character , and Ryder 's special features commentary that no one is immune to a `` visit , '' brief or prolonged , at McLean.Other aspects were downright disturbing . So many reviewers commented about how Lisa ( Angelina Jolie ) said it like it was , `` the truth-telling sociopath . '' How she treated Daisy ( Britney Murphy ) was n't truth-telling ; it was a combination of transference , projection , and blaming the victim , completely devoid of empathy . I always thought that sociopaths were like Ted Bundy and Hitler , but Lisa did n't seem to be that type of threat to society . Despite how cruel she could be , Lisa showed softer feelings and protested to Susanna that she really was n't dead ( emotionally ) . I could n't help but feel sorry for this character . Susanna does see Lisa as a warning for what our protagonist could become if she does n't get better . However , Susanna has a completely different diagnosis , so the psychiatric ward longevity and self-destructive behavior would be the real danger of the similarity . Despite how mesmerized Susanna was by Lisa and how close the two of them were , I never thought that this movie developed/captured this relationship to that extent . If the movie had retained some of the deleted scenes , maybe this closeness would have been more convincing.The acting was really intense . Ryder , with her large , luminous eyes , drew us in to the self-reflective and indecisive Susanna . Jolie did n't hold back with her interpretation of Lisa : her virtuosic display of nuanced angst and unbridled anger was Oscar caliber . And I just wanted to comfort Britney Murphy 's Daisy.Whoopi Goldberg stole the show in all her scenes . When Susanna was baiting her with racially charged diatribe , this nurse had the sense not to take it personally . She continued to encourage Susanna by telling her she was n't going to be a long-term patient and gave her some sound advice and feedback.This movie seemed a bit disjointed ( and I 'm not referring to the movie 's heavy use of flashbacks ) , but hey , maybe that was purposely done to represent the lack of order and coherence felt by the institutionalized young women ( and the young people of that generation ) .This movie did n't move me like The Bell Jar , but it did move me . It had some beautiful moments and keen insights . If its overall effect is to inspire compassion for the mentally ill , then I can not complain . This movie makes a good point about how Bell Jars come in different sizes , shapes , and distortions . We 're all susceptible to off-kilter phases , or girl interruptions .	1
I heard about this movie and was dying to see it , but being under 17 and my parents still a little wary about rated R in theaters , I decided to read the book . And what a difference between the two . I 'm not going to list them because I want you to read the book for yourself . The movie is about Suzanna Kaysen ( played by an amazing Winona Ryder ) who was sent to an asylum . There she meets a host of characters including Lisa , which has got to be Angelina Jolie 's best performance as far as I 'm concerned , who is a diagnosed sociopath . She also meets Polly , a sweetnatured woman who burned the side of her face at age 10 , Georgia , a compulsive liar , and Daisy , a girl addicted to laxatives and her father 's chicken . This story is n't for the meek , that 's for sure . And it 's definately NOT for children ! Some of the scenes in the asylum are maybe upsetting , not that they 're violent , but the story takes place in an asylum so what do you expect ? This movie is n't neccesarily candy and rainbows , but that 's what makes it so real . And when Suzanna talks about the girls being their friends , you know how she feels . If you enjoyed this movie , and even if you did n't , be sure to read the book . In my opinion it 's a lot better and delves more into the subject .	1
I forgot a lot of the subtleties of this film , I am glad I watched it again . The acting is solid and there are a lot of emotional moments .	1
I liked this movie , however , it is a bit confusing and hard to follow . Also , since it has been called a & quot ; teen flick & quot ; some of the lines were a bit unrealistic for teenagers to be saying . Especially in the pool scene . I know that some people say the end ( with the car , i wont say more and ruin it ... ) is cheap , but personally i love it when Catherine is & quot ; torn apart & quot ; by her felow classmates ! I think that a broad spectrum of people would enjoy this movie !	1
I love this movie , I love it a lot . I dont think that there was too much homosexuality in it , and I think if its a good movie it has to warp a couple minds , thats why its rated R anyway . I like the manipulation that takes place in the story . Sarah Michelle Gellar has also never looked better in anything she has done . After I watched this , I said to myself , I didnt know movies could be made like this ( I had never seen Dangerous Liasons ) I was stunned and in awe . So I watched it again and again and again . It was great the first couple of times but there are points where the story gets too lovy dovy for me .	1
This movie is an excellent blend of romance , drama , and deceit . In the beginning , Kathryn and Sebastian are both out to ruin as many lives as possible . They use sex and secrets as their weapon . Sebastian became involved in a bet to devirginize the new headmaster 's daughter . If he wins , he gets to have sex with Kathryn . In the midst of the bet , he falls in love with her . This love leads to tragedy and revenge .	1
This movie is 50 % wicked 50 % fun and 100 % entertaining ! It has an awsome cast and a killer soundtrack ! Its a love story made for teens filled with love suduction and betrayel ! Sebastion ( Ryan Phillipe ) and Kathrine ( Sarah M.Geller ) sizzle as a pair of muliputive step siblings out to ruin the lives of others through seduction , sex , and betrayl !	1
What 's up with Selma Blair 's retarded rag doll performance-it 's disctracting and really not as funny as the producers seem to think.Otherwise I think this film is sleek and perfect . I own and watch it regularly .	1
The proformances are just great and wicked in a good way.Especially Sarah Michelle Gellar who put the best proformance in the whole movie.This movie is about sex and betrayal and also very wickedly funny . NOT FOR KIDS buy it now and I promise your love it .	1
How many times has `` Cruel Intentions '' been around yet ? Four times ? Usually , classic novels do n't get any better the more often you make a movie out of it . Not this time ... this movie is just great . It 's fast-paced , funny , sexy and- most of all- very romantic . The characters are extremely well drawn and never annoying ( especially Sebastian Valmont is simply great ... you hate him , but you love him ... at the same time ) . You actually never get bored by this vehicle , as the time goes by as fast as a ride in a 1956 Jaguar . By the , way , ALL of the actors do agreat job , though most of them are pretty new in the business . Thumbs up for that one !	1
There is something about the casting in this film , ie : every lead seems to fit their character perfectly.Ryan Phillipe is great as the sexy and manipulative Sebastian who falls for the one girl who does n't fall for him.Reese Witherspoon is excellent as the virgin-in-waiting . Between her performance here and that in last year 's Election , she has proven herself to be one of the most talented young actors around.Overall , I think Sarah Michelle Gellar steals the show here ( my boyfriend agrees with me on this one , believe me ) as a conniving , two-faced , slithering sex godess who gets hers . Let 's just say The Verve 's & quot ; Bittersweet Symphony & quot ; was & quot ; made & quot ; for the ending of this film.Of course , the film is over the top and kinda silly . But it 's great entertainment . And , as another reviewer said , the cast is very sexy . ( Let 's not forget Selma Blair here , who does a great job playing an & quot ; innocent & quot ; who is easily ( and very willingly ) corrupted . ) So to sum up , steamy movie , plot twists , sex , a love story , beautiful homes , people , clothes and surroundings . A shallow , sinful little way to spend an evening . Which is nice once in a while , like a grande frapuccino , really sweet , but yummy .	1
Drama can sometimes be hard to deal with , and above all this movie made you think . You often wondered how the ( barely existing ) consciences of Sebastian and Catherine allowed them to get away with their various and sundry , petty and not-so-petty crimes . Cruel Intentions is the best possible title for this film , because it describes perfectly what you will see when you watch it.I did experience an odd epiphany at the end of the movie . I found myself hoping , in a strange way , that Katherine would win . Yes , that she would come out on top , even though she was the cruelest of the cruel in this film . I realized that I wanted her to give her speech and just keep rolling her eyes afterwards and planning the inevitable & quot ; excitements & quot ; ahead of her in the coming year . I suppose it is the power of the movie to bring out the strangest feelings in people , since I , like many , do not normally agree with the villian.I enjoyed this movie . Star power can sometimes overpower a movie , but in this case it set it free . And it was good to see five or six familiar faces . In a movie where everything everyone does is wrong , the only way a character seems relatable is if you can see their face and connect it to a different experience . A 3.5-4 star movie .	1
What more can be said about this movie ? The sound track is great , Sarah and Ryan , Reese and Selma all fit into the film perfectly . The rather twisted story about a step brother and sister 's sexual deviations just adds more flavor to an otherwise excellent movie . Ryan and Sarah interact pretty well . And who can forget Selma Blair and Sarah Michelle Gellar 's smooching in Central Park . ( Which won an award for best kiss of 1999 ) If you 're into twisted , modern young and filthy rich movies ( The In crowd is good too ) this is one to get . If you are a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan you get to see some of her best acting ever in this film ( as well as her real hair color . )	1
I did n't expect much from this film . I just picked it out of curiosity , and to my surprise , I enjoyed this movie . It was better than I thought . I felt watching a movie version of Gossip Girl . I am always fascinated by high society , and with all that power , how it can affect one 's life.The movie does have subtle message , but for me , it was jut about learning the art of seduction . : ) Pretty cool .	1
I will get right to the point . This is my favorite movie of all time . It has everything including Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe , my favorite actor and actress . It also has a perfect soundtrack . The songs actually liven the mood of whatever scene they are featured in , unlike some other films out there . The sets are amazing too , really breathtaking . Kathryn 's room is done is ice blue , because that is what she is ... cold . Sebastian 's is rich gold and brown , because he has that soft inner side to him which eventually does come out in the movie when he falls in love with Annette . I wo n't bore you with the details or what the movie is about , because every other review has done that already . All I can say is that this movie is perfect , because it has an original plot & it 's a modern telling of an alltime classic novel . You could n't ask for a more talented cast including the wonderful Reese Witherspoon and newcomer Selma Blair . This is a movie that once you watch , you want to watch it over and over again . There 's something new each time you watch it . The DVD is amazing also . It has TONS of special features including commentary , deleted scenes , information on the set design which is very interesting and informative , interviews with the cast and crew , two wonderful music videos and of course the theatrical trailer . A wonderful DVD for an amazing movie . The ending is wonderful also . Unlike some movies , you ca n't predict what will happen .	1
Before they were famous , they were in this dark , cute film about high school treachery . The star power makes it compelling and irresistible ; though they 're young , you ca n't take your eyes off as they create sordid pits and traps for others to fall into.It helps if you 're familiar with the original film , Les Liaisons Dangereuses , as context . To that film , this one is a spirited companion.Do n't expect auteur-quality directing or atmosphere ; it 's not that kind of movie . Instead , it 's a movie about personalities , power , sex . And the beauty and passion of love.The addition of a journal and the coke-cross give the original film a fresh take . In all , a delightful take on high school politics . Which are , by definition , the politics of the world .	1
This modern day addaptation of Dangerous Liasons took us to another level with the heartless , calculated antics of teenagers . While this was panned by critics , it spoke to something in the audience in it 's sociopathic tendencies.Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn , the student body president of an elitist New York boarding school and step sister of Ryan Phillipe , the big man on campus whose charms hide a sinister skirt chaser . She makes a bet with him that he will not be able to bed Reese Witherspoon , who has proclaimed her intensions to remain a virgin until marriage . Should he succeed , he can have Kathryn . If he fails , Kathryn can have his car.Perhaps critics were astounded that kids can really be this cruel , but maybe they forgot what it was like to be a kid themselves . Just listen to the gossip and heartless talk of teenagers and you will know what I mean . Ryan Phillipe is every girl 's dream come true and worst nightmare . While he uses his good looks and charms to get as many women in his bed as he can , he will post nude photos of them on the Internet and pat himself on the back as a stud . Give him a challenge , such as Reese Witherspoon , and he has to work hard for it . While he is truly a cad , he does in the end feel love for Reese because he had to work for her affections . Kathryn gets the greatest satisfaction of saying no , as she knows that he is truly hurt to have ended the affair when they did nothing but take joy in toying with emotions . Listen to a few locker room conversations and chats in the homeroom , that 's what it 's all about.As the viewer , you ca n't help but take perverse pleasure in their plotting and watching others fall victim to their schemes . How about that scene when Kathryn says she puts her trust in Jesus and unscrews the cross to reveil her coke spoon ? That 's classic . If anything it teaches you to not fall for others ' fronts . So girls , be careful of who seems so sincere . And boys , do n't be so cruel .	1
Sarah Michelle Gellar playing the bad guy ... ..yummy . So used to her as the heroin and now to see her portray a sizzling and seductive character . In my eyes , she can do no wrong . And now , this tantalizing twisted flick hits the high-def arena , I jumped to see Gellar in all her glory . Sony 's recent blu-ray releases are blessed with all the bells and whistles and spares no expense in providing them on dual-layer disks . The picture looks fabulous and included an uncompressed 5.1 PCM track to my listening pleasure . All I can say is , sit back and enjoy the ride .	1
Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics , who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989 's Dangerous Liaisons ( both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos 's novel , Les Liaisons Dangereuses ) . Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original , Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York , where underneath the veneer of respectability , wealthy teenagers plot each other 's downfalls.Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers . They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them , and make wagers on the outcome . The focus of the movie is Sebastian 's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster 's virginal daughter , Annette ( who , in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism , wears white throughout almost the entire film ) .However , the movie certainly has some memorable high points , beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks ; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard . The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack , which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim . The Verve 's song , Bittersweet Symphony , is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts ' track at the film 's conclusion.These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive , but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen , it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers . In the end though , perhaps we just like to see someone be very , very wicked and almost get away with it .	1
Being from a rural community in Texas , I totally got this movie . I loved the conversation at the graduation party that was short on words but long on meaning , as the two men looked up at the sky for rain .	1
This movie has everything we expect in a Jackie Chan flick , including plenty of bad guys for Jackie to fight ( some are clearly great martial artists themselves , not just actors , as mentioned by other reviewers ) , pretty girls that Jackie must save , death defying stunts , chase scenes , guns , explosions , and plenty of humor . Two thumbs up ! Regarding the dvd format , the one I saw in store had widescreen on one side and full screen on the other . ( I own it on vhs myself and am considering upgrading to the dvd . ) Some of you parents might also like to know this one has no nudity .	1
As many reviewers have pointed out before me , the plot in this film is fairly thin . There are some good guys , some bad guys , some really bad guys , and then there is Jackie Chan , who 've forgotten everything.The action , however , is phaenomenal . Once again Chan is pushing the outside of the envelope with his death defying stunts and splendid martial arts choreography including everything you can think of . Even clogs . The final fight , as has been said before , is a thing you 'll want to see again and again . It is amazing.There are some really tell tale signs , that this is a JC movie ( apart from the action stuff ) . There is the obvious humour , the rather sketchy caricatures of good/bad people , and the fact that although he is a commando/trained killer he is goodness himself . A thoroughly joyful film to watch this one .	1
Who Am I has it all - a decent story , great stunts , long car chase scene , some good ol ' Jackie Chan comedy , and a roof-top fight scene that is unbelievable.Jackie Chan plays `` Jackie Chan '' , a special forces agent who is the last to survive a mission of deception in South Africa . Struck with amnesia , he sets on a quest to recover his identity , only to find himself being chased by gangs of men led by the man that Jackie thinks is helping him . The first 30 minutes of the movie is very slow , but the action picks up quickly when the chases begin.Fortunately , the movie only gets better as it progresses , till a final roof-top fight with Jackie against 2 men , who have excellent martial arts skills . The fight scene literally lasts 8-1/2 minutes , with constant kicking , punching , and some Jackie stunts here and there . To finish it off , Jackie performs his best stunt of the movie , sliding down the glass angled side of the skyscraper.If you like Jackie Chan movies , you will be pleased to know this is an above average treat . If nothing else , the ending of the movie is worth every bit in gold .	1
I saw bits and pieces of the movie before . Really wanted to see what the whole movie was about . This is a great movie , got jakie 's normal action stunts , and his normal body gags as well . Love this and it 's a collection keeper for me .	1
This is a fine Jackie Chan movie . Not sure what the original language was , but it does n't really matter . Great story line and awesome fighting scenes with a few interesting twists make this a fine movie .	1
This is a great Jackie Chan movie if you have n't seen it yet . It has a lot of great action and stunts in it .	1
Woody Allen 's `` Manhattan Murder Mystery '' marks a return to the sort of dialogue driven comedy which he does so very well . It has its share of witty one liners and some set piece scenes that give the viewer if not rolling belly laughs at least some good smiles . ( and the occasional laugh out loud ) The plot reminded me very vaguely of `` Rear Window '' and the screen chemistry between Woody and Diane Keaton is wonderful . The plot revolves around all sorts of twists and turns and , without giving anything away , suffice to say the mystery is quite mysterious and certainly intriguing and the resolution is satisfying when it finally comes . If like me you enjoy a Woody Allen film starring Woody and has him at peak form as writer , director and star then this is for you . Let me also mention Anjelica Huston and Alan Alda both at the top of their game in supporting roles . I liked it and would recommend it .	1
After the abrasive brilliance of & quot ; Husbands and Wives & quot ; , Woody wisely lightened up and reteamed with two of his old partners-in-crime , Diane Keaton and writing partner Marshall Brickman . What 's amazing is that though the movie seems rather lightweight on the surface , it really juggles a lot of different ideas at once . It is a comedy crime caper , but it toys with the idea that Keaton is imagining the whole thing in an effort to spice up a humdrum marriage . Does Alan Alda 's character find the possibility of a murder tantalizing , or does he simply see it as a great way to get closer to Keaton ? Does Anjelica Huston 's character find the possibility of a murder tantalizing , or does she simply see it as a great way to get closer to Woody ? Or both ? The only sure thing is Woody , who reminds us that , aside from everything else , he 's an absolutely peerless comic actor . He goes from being skeptical and annoyed at Keaton 's obsession , to gradually escalating levels of fear , fear of both the murder and of losing his wife . It 's great to see these two working together again so effortlessly , as though & quot ; Annie Hall & quot ; had just wrapped the week before .	1
I absolutely loved this film . I laughed . I jumped . I laughed some more.This script had been laying around for quite some time , and when Allen decided to resurrect it , I 'm SO glad he got Diane Keaton to join him for the filming . Their chemistry is still there , and so is Allen 's wonderful neurotic schtick . The elevator scene is priceless . I also greatly enjoyed the tape-player skit with Allen 's inimitable bumbling.I think the film hiccups a bit when it abruptly switches to a film-noir ending . Mind you , I enjoyed the ending , especially the Welles homage , but I think this decidedly dark ending causes the whole vehicle to lose momentum.All in all this great fun with plenty of zany suspense and the fabulous interplay of Allen and Keaton .	1
It is another decent outing by Woody Allen , but it does not reach the heights of his masterpieces .	1
I love this movie simply because it does n't seem they are acting at all but normal people carrying on conversations and reacting like people would	1
This was another one of Woody Allen 's wonderful movies . I love how his character is so nervous all the time when he and his wife ( played by the wonderful Diane Keaton ) investigate is great.Allen plays Larry Lipton , a writer/publisher who just wants his and his wife 's life to be normal . We soon meet his wife , Carol ( Keaton ) , who is definitely more ambitious and more willing to take a risk . The supporting cast includes Alan Alda , Anjelica Huston , Ron Rifkin , and Joy Behar.For the Liptons , things are just fine until they meet their neighbors , who seem very nice and welcoming . When they learn that the wife has 'died ' of a heart attack , Carol becomes suspicious , especially when she learns that the wife had a heart disease , something she never told Carol . Larry dismisses this and wants her to leave it alone and let the husband grieve . Yet Carol thinks he is a little too up-beat after losing his wife of over 20 years . So naturally , Carol investigates along with her very good friend Ted ( Alda ) . Larry slowly becomes jealous that the two of them are together all the time and thinks that if he does n't become more ambitious , that his marriage is going to fall apart . So he decides to join his wife on solving this mystery . Together , the two encounter much more than they had planned on . The result is priceless . Their little one-liners to each other ( Carol calling him a 'Fuddy-Duddy , ' reminding me of Annie Hall saying 'La de da ... ' ) are great.If you 're a Woody Allen fan , this is a must see movie . If you 're not a Woody Allen fan , you may not enjoy it . But if you have never seen any of his movies and do n't know much about him , rent this and see if you like it !	1
enjoy Woody Allen 's movies and this one is GREAT ! Would reccomend this movie to anyone who enjoys mysteries ! ! Thank You ... Marion Edwards	1
Although it lacks the patina of greatness that surrounds & quot ; Hannah and Her Sisters & quot ; or & quot ; Crimes and Misdemeanors , & quot ; Manhattan Murder Mystery is one of my favorite Woody Allen movies . From the opening credits , with swooping night aerial shots of Manhattan as Bobby Short sings , & quot ; I Happen to Like New York , & quot ; Allen clues us in that this movie will be his biggest , happiest , most loving valentine ever to his home town . The murder mystery of the title is good enough -- it even contains & quot ; un hommage a ' Orson Welles & quot ; at the end , borrowing from & quot ; The Lady from Shanghai & quot ; -- but what 's really important to Allen are the city itself and the people who live there . The film is filled with loving , mature relationships ; it 's really sad to think that Allen finished writing the screenplay ( with Marshall Brickman ) just before the big blowup with Mia , which dragged his name through the mud and led to the unwatchable orgies of self-justification ( & quot ; Celebrity , & quot ; & quot ; Mighty Aphrodite & quot ; ) which have comprised most of his later work . But one good thing arose from the split with Mia : Woody got to work again with Diane Keaton in Manhattan Murder Mystery , thus reuniting a screen romantic team that ranks with Tracy and Hepburn , Powell and Loy , or Wayne and O'Hara . To see their hand-in-glove screen chemistry once again is alone worth the price of this video , while Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston are almost equally charming as the second leads . Manhattan Murder Mystery , in my opinion , holds roughly the same place in Allen 's oeuvre as & quot ; Donovan 's Reef & quot ; does in John Ford 's ; it 's not one of the & quot ; major & quot ; works , but it 's eternally refreshing and delightful , and all the director 's major themes are there .	1
I 've never been a Woody Allen fan ( which is why I only recently watched this film ) , but this one is truly excellent . A romantic comedy paying homage to Read Window and nosey neighbors.I highly recommend this one !	1
Woody Allen has made a lot of cinema for what is it , nearly forty years ? It seems ridiculous that he can make so many good films , with such a range of background and material . Here he is again , miraculously combining the tragic reality of a series of killings into a workable comedy about just how seriously we take the things that go on around us.This is a long film , yet it never loses its grip on us . Like the character of Woody in the film , we are inexorably drawn into the story , whether we like it or not . Both the comedy of Woody expressing doubts about the truth of anything and everything ( until he finally catches on ) and the utter tension as he and his wife are drawn into a web from which it will finally be too late to escape , are masterful . As Woody goes through the final scene , grim now in his understanding of so much that he formerly doubted , including his own relationship , the drama is brought to an unexpected and highly satisfactory close and we are left with a close-mouthed feeling that `` that was close . `` Allen plays with real life in unreal ways . His strength lies partly in the angle he shows it from , whether humorous or tragic . But whichever way it goes , it 's always Allen and I , for one , am thankful that we can still rely on him . Top notch film worth every star you can lay your hands on .	1
Great cast , well-written , funny and even suspenseful , this movie is unlike any other Woody Allen film , with elements of Hitchcock . Great for all ages !	1
Allen 's a nebbish old man who wants to mind his ( quickly deteriorating love- ) life with an unagreeable wife.Sensing this stale mate , the wife played by Diane Keaton , is out for some excitement . Which she gets , in a big way , when a neighbor dies . Just the evening after the two couples had a casual evening coffee.Suspicions ensue . Old flames pop up . Relationships intertwine and flare . Clues unravel . Marital discord and sensitive chords are struck . All with vintage Allen humor , part neurotic , part drunk on its wit.The cinematography is handsome , literally here , as candid steady cams are employed , giving the film its constantly roving hand-held look . I personally find this cloying after a while.The murder itself is mildly suspenseful , but that 's barely the point with a W-Allen movie . The twists are intelligent enough and managed to hold my attention for the duration of the movie.All in all , despite the slightly cop-out denouement , it is generally quite an amusing experience . Recommended rental .	1
What would you get if you crossed THE HITCHIKER 'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY with THERE 'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY ? Well , I would wager that the outcome would be something not dissimilar to this erotic farce of a movie ! The film is narrated by an alien observer and seems to take a few shots at anthropologists . So many times you see documentaries on the DISCOVERY channel where experts say that such-and-such people lived in & quot ; exactly & quot ; such-and-such a way . Perhaps I am wrong , but it would appear the writer of this story saw one-too-many cultural documentaries and decided to have a little fun.Carmen Electra is good to her name as she electrifies the screen . Although this is the only movie I 've ever seen her in , I must admit that she does seem to possess some decent acting talent - which is more than I can say for a great many & quot ; typecast & quot ; actresses.If you 're in the mood for a zany Romantic comedy , this one just might be worth a try . It covers our mating habits from beginning to end , and it includes all of the wonderful nonsense in between !	1
This movie is a hilarious ! The basic premise is that David Hyde Pierce narrates the courtship of a young couple as if it were a nature video ( for aliens ) . There 's a lot of other humorous comparisons ( i.e . the runners in swim caps ) , but the voice-over is the best . Do yourself a favor and rent or buy this movie !	1
Yesterday , 11/02/07 , this movie brightened a dull day for me . If only someone other than Carmen Electra had played the lead female role ! Mackenzie Astin , other reviewers to the contrary , was just right as the testosterone-driven male lead . Carmen Electra looked too old and worn for her part . Nonetheless , this is a good deal better than a great many Hollywood comedies of more recent vintage . Though the idea is an almost obvious one , it comes to life because of the clever script . It IS better than most of Woody Allen . Thank goodness no one had the poor judgment to cast Jim Carrey in the male lead . Astin 's character has to be played , as he does it , naively and innocently jn order for the movie not to seem overly contrived . Where has Astin 's career gone ?	1
& quot ; Bottle Rocket & quot ; lacks the focus and maturity of Wes Anderson 's two later films , & quot ; Rushmore & quot ; and & quot ; The Royal Tenenbaums & quot ; , but it is nonetheless a satisfying and often very funny film . Based on a short film that director/co-writer Anderson made in 1994 , & quot ; Bottle Rocket & quot ; tells the story of three 20-somethings who aspire to be thieves.The comparison to & quot ; Reservoir Dogs & quot ; that appears on the cover is without basis , in my opinion . There is little grit or darkness to Wes 's film . There 's next-to-nothing in the way of violence or true obscenity ( the things that often turn me off to Tarantino 's films ) . It 's colorful and bouncy , which is a good way to describe Dignan , the offbeat character played by co-writer Owen Wilson . It 's the finest comedy work I 've seen from Owen.It 's also ( along with & quot ; Tenenbaums & quot ; ) the best performance I 've seen from his brother Luke , who plays the protagonist Anthony . Luke 's performance is subdued and also , very funny . The brothers have great chemistry together , and are able to make each other 's performance more entertaining.Robert Musgrave rounds out the trio and gives a delightfully quirky performance as the awkward one who endures constant abuse from his brother . He cements his place in the group simply because he is the one who has the car . James Caan and Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana also deliver energy and comedy in their supporting roles. & quot ; Bottle Rocket & quot ; is a wise film , and it makes a nice companion to the two aforementioned Wes Anderson films that everyone has seen . It is wise , fast-moving and extremely funny , although certainly not to everyone 's tastes.The DVD from Columbia/TriStar is completely featureless ( not even a trailer ) , but it displays the film 's colorful palette with a crispness and fidelity that is most satisfying .	1
Ever since Wes Anderson has been releasing special editions of his films through the Criterion Collection , fans have been hoping that Bottle Rocket would get deluxe treatment . The wait is finally over.Disc one starts things off with an audio commentary by director/co-writer Wes Anderson and actor/co-writer Owen Wilson . They touch upon which scenes from the original short film survived into the feature . They also point out the re-shoots done after a disastrous test screening . Anderson and Wilson talk about how producer James L. Brooks helped them get Bottle Rocket made and taught them about screenwriting . It 's great to hear these two long-time friends talk about their first film.On disc two there is `` The Making of Bottle Rocket , '' a 25-minute retrospective featurette that brings back key cast and crew members as they reflect on how the film came together and what they think of it now . There is footage from the short film and outtakes from the feature film . One gets the impression that James L. Brooks really mentored Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson . Mainly , it is just great to see everyone from Luke Wilson to Kumar Pallana reminiscing about making this film . `` Storyboards '' is a collection of Anderson 's original sketches for specific shots and scenes in the film . `` The Bottle Rocket Short '' was shot in 1992 with only $ 4,000 on 16mm black and white film stock . Running only 13 minutes , it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 1993 . Crappy copies have circulated on the Internet for some time and now fans can throw them away as this copy looks great . One can see the core ingredients of what would become feature film.Also included are a collection of deleted scenes that include the source of Future Man 's name but mostly there are several scenes between Anthony , Bob and Dignan . There are some really entertaining and funny bits but one can see why this stuff was cut . `` Murita Cycles '' features friend and collaborator of Wes Anderson and the Wilson family , Barry Braverman and a short documentary that he made about his father , a Staten Island bicycle shop owner that inspired the Bottle Rocket short film . `` The Shafrazi Lectures , No.1 : Bottle Rocket '' is a rather odd featurette with a guy reviewing the film . He compares it to films from the 1950s and talks about his favourite scenes . `` Anamorphic Test , '' Originally , Anderson planned to shoot the film in the widescreen Panavision format and shot a test scene that actually looks really good . It 's too bad that they did n't go that way.Finally , there is a collection of photographs by Laura Wilson , the Wilson brothers ' mother . We see Anderson and the Wilsons planning the short film in 1992 . There are shots of them at Sundance and also lots of great behind-the-scenes snap shots of them making the feature film .	1
Director Wes Anderson 's BOTTLE ROCKET is the living proof that you can still present a comedy without being vulgar and without having to destroy 40 cars in 90 minutes . And it works.Wes Anderson does have a peculiar gift . He is able to give life to the strangest characters and make you care for them . The hero of RUSHMORE and Luke -Anthony Adams- Wilson in BOTTLE ROCKET are uncommon guys , so naive in the way they are apprehending the outside world that you can not but smile while following their adventures.I strongly recommend you this movie if you want to wash your eyes from the turpitudes of today cinema.A smart DVD .	1
`` BOTTLE ROCKET '' is most definitely a hilarious but yet an insanely awkward film that just sticks in your head because of how wild and crazy it is.Released in 1996 , the film would be the directorial debut for Wes Anderson ( `` RUSHMORE '' , `` THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS '' , `` Life Aquatic with Steve Zizzou '' ) and the debut of the Wilson brothers : Owen Wilson ( Co-writer ) and Luke Wilson ( plus brother Andrew ) and Robert Musgrave who all grew up together in Texas.Back in 1992 , the first initial concept of `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' was shot in 16mm film on B & W ; after the group was able to raise about $ 4,000 and raise more money and eventually have the 13 minutes extra to have a short film and submit it to the Sundance Film Festival in 1994.After being screened for the festival , the film was able to attract a few producers who were willing to invest in making `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' to a full-length film and thus , Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson had their first major opportunity.As the story goes , the film did terrible in its first test screening which shocked everyone . The film then had its final released cut which then was released in theaters in 1996 and the film bombed . In fact , to everyone 's surprie , the film could n't even get screened at Sundance ( where the short film version was able to be screened years prior ) .But there were many people who loved the film and for critics , it was a critically acclaimed film that some critics were quite passionate about such as the LA Times ( blasting Sundance Film Festival for not screening it ) and then followed by director Martin Scorsese calling it one of his favorite films in the 1990 's , the film reached cult-status.Flash forward 12 years later and with three of Wes Anderson 's films released on THE CRITERION COLLECTION on DVD , what an awesome way to kick off THE CRITERION COLLECTION 's entry to Blu-ray in Dec. 2008 with the release of `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' , Anderson 's first film.VIDEO & AUDIO : THE CRITERION COLLECTION is all about gathering the greatest films around the world and publish them in the highest technical quality but the focus is to present the film the way the original director intended . For film fans , THE CRITERION COLLECTION is known for its quality and rarely do fans question the releases , the releases are embraced as fans are introduced to important classics or contemporary films.For `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' , the film is presented in its original aspect ration of 1:85:1 . The film 's presentation was supervised and approved by Wes Anderson and the Director of Photography Robert Yeoman . The high definition transfer was scanned on a Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35mm interpositive and thousands of instances of dirt , debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Resotration System and Pixel Farm 's PFClean.The video quality of this film looks great especially for a film created in the early to mid-90 's . Typically films released on Blu-ray during these years have been clean but have this softness effect where the vibrancy of the colors are not as beautiful as I would like it to be . With `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' , the film had many outdoor scenes and literally from the red 's to the blues and greens and the yellow jumpsuit that the guys wear , these colors are vibrant in Blu-ray HD.As for audio , audio was mastered at 24-bit from the original magnetic tracks and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks , pops , hiss and crackle . The film is primarily a dialogue based film , thus a lot of the audio is coming from your front channel speakers . There are scenes with gunshots and music that come out quite live on your home theater channels but the film is primarily a dialogue-based film.SPECIAL FEATURES : For the special features , the following are included : * AUDIO COMMENTARY - A commentary featuring Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson . The commentary is not more on the filmmaking perspective but more of nostalgia as the guys talk about memories of people they worked with , areas they shot and how some of the people on the crew have moved on to bigger things . * THE MAKING OF `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' - A featurette with interviews with Wes Anderson , the Owens brothers , James Caan , Kumar Pallana , the producers and more . You learn a lot about the behind-the-scenes of the film from creating the short film , Sundance , how the test screening was a bomb , how the film was not a commercial success but became a cult hit and much more . Great insight on the actors about being part of the job , how they were able to get James Caan for the film and how the producers felt about the talent at the time . A fun and informative documentary by filmmaker Barry Braverman . * The Bottle Rocket Shorts - The actual 13-minute B & W ; short film that was created back in 1992 . * Storyboards - Wes Anderson 's original storyboards and sketches for the film . * Anamorphic Test - Anamorphic test shots of several scenes from the film and how Anderson originally planned to shoot the film in widescreen Panavision . Test shots . * `` The Shafrazi Lectures , No . 1 Bottle Rocket '' - A guy who is reviewing the film and talking about why he loved it . * `` Murita Cycles '' - A Short film created Barry Braverman ( friend and collaborator for Anderson and the Wilson family ) about his father , a Staten Island bicycle shop owner which inspired the guys to create `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' . * Behind-the-Scenes Photograps by Laura Wilson - The Wilson brothers also had a talented mother who is a photographer that took pictures of Wes , Owen and Luke during the planning stages of the film and also at Sundance . * Deleted Scenes - There were a quite a number of scenes that were cut and eleven featured on the disc . Scenes that would have explained how `` Futureman '' got his name , what Dignan and Applejack were up to when they went to by Bob 's place , another scene of how the pot was found in Bob 's home and much , much more.Also included is a booklet that features an appreciation by director Martin Scorsese ( which is a tribute that appeared in the March 2000 issue of ESQUIRE Magazine ) , an essay book by executive producer James L. Brooks ( written as an introduction to the `` RUSHMORE '' screenplay published in 1999 ) which really goes into detail of how `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' was created and things that happened behind-the-scenes not mentioned on the special features and artwork by Ian Dingman.JUDGMENT CALL : '' BOTTLE ROCKET '' is just an amazing , awkward and hilarious film . Forget about the `` Oceans # '' type of films that try to bring comedy to heist films , BOTTLE ROCKET '' was special because it came from these young people who were not known at the time but their vision of filmmaking and storytelling just sticks into your mind.You know that feeling about pulling a prank that got a lot of laughs during your younger years and you remember it to this day . This is how I felt about certain scenes from `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' . There were a lot of humor that was not meant to be taken in as a joke but for these characters of Dignan , Anthony and Bob , you ca n't help but be entertained and laugh.From memorable scenes of the group putting tape on top of their noses before their heist , to how rob the bookstore but at the same time , those being held hostage just look at them as non-dangerous and almost humorous ( despite Dignan carrying a gun ) .And then scenes of love as Anthony falls for this woman who ca n't speak any English and goes where she goes as she cleans each hotel room and just falls in love . And his far out drawings of his love for Inez.And also the team assembled by Dignan for their major heist . One would think , why he would select really old men ( especially one who had some major memory loss issues ) to bring with him for a major robbery ? But you realize it 's Dignan and you just accept his approach to pulling of a heist and enjoy the ride.There are many of these moments in the film that you just think back and just be amazed of how much of those type of scenes were included . Wes Anderson and Owen Williams are just an amazing duo and although at the time , they were not known in the industry , it just showed you how much potential these guys had when they first emerged and eventually they would go on to have successful careers making many more films together.As for the Blu-ray disc , again , THE CRITERION COLLECTION manages to pull of another wonderful release . Wonderful picture quality that is vibrant in colors and again , I 've reviewed many major films released in the early and mid-90 's and although cleaned up , never have the vibrancy or sharpness but this softness that always bugged me . This was not the case of `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' , the film looks great ! And the amount of special features and also the booklet that really help enhance one 's appreciation for the film . You would n't expect anything less from CRITERION and sure enough , they delivered . `` BOTTLE ROCKET '' is a fun , hilarious and well-written film that is so different from any film that has come out . It 's not a moronic film , nor is it a serious heist film . It 's just a film that is just all-out fun and one can understand why it has become a popular cult film.Highly recommended !	1
Possibly Wes Anderson 's funniest movie . Its characters were flimsy fluts trying to become big time with a lack of direction and mental capacity . They made me laugh and laugh again . They just were n't clued in to the same channel that everyone else was watching . And there lies the brilliants behind Anderson 's movies . He takes a character and gives him a gung-ho attitude about wierd and trivial things-and everyone else takes these characters seriously . It is unique . The colors of this movie shine , the jokes punctuate and the acting was off the wall . I recommened this movie to anyone who is searching for a new type of humor developed from some very funny men .	1
BOTTLE ROCKET is an exceptionally fresh and thoroughly fun movie . I found myself smiling throughout , and not even sure why . I ca n't even say what kind of movie it is . For BOTTLE ROCKET defies any attempt at classification , any assault on its originality and creativity by placing it neatly in a box . It is neither a comedy nor a drama ; not a love story nor a crime flick . It blends all of these genres -- along with a pinch of classic Americana -- into a very unique , delightful movie . Yet it is also a deliciously messy enigma : a loosely strung-together melange of brillance and childishness , high and pop art , profundity and absurdity . By the film 's conclusion , I knew I had seen something special , a truly inspired and deeply personal work.BOTTLE ROCKET 's power lies in its characters . They are so quirky , so unique , that they seem unmistakably real , and therefore patently likeable . They are simple people who lead quietly extraordinary and beautiful lives , people who believe in following one 's dreams , chasing after true love , being individuals -- and all with childlike wonder , innocence , and joie de vivre . In short , they are people of unique and genuine character . They also happen to be hysterically funny . BOTTLE ROCKET , while I would not categorically call it a comedy , is easily one of the funniest movies of the nineties . The brothers Owen and Luke Wilson give laudable ( although not flawless ) performances as the two principals , and they are supported admirably by some great character actors.BOTTLE ROCKET is also a beatiful picture . The photograhpy is excellent -- stylish in an understated way -- and this adds an element of class to an already quality piece . Almost every shot would make an excellent photograph , full of rich and subtle detail , and interesting interplay of colors , textures , and distances . BOTTLE ROCKET does not have lavish sets , nor does it take place in exotic locales . Anderson instead transforms what would otherwise be lacklustre settings like rural Texas and a cheap motel into places of almost otherworldly beauty . The lighting has a lot to do with this effect , giving the movie a very clean , bright feel -- think of a J.Crew ad , only set in the rural Midwest instead of a Cape Cod beach house . The movie gives the warm , uplifting feeling of a young , free , and beautiful America , a feeling one gets at certain times reading Kerouac . The music is superb to boot , as in all Anderson 's flicks , and greatly enhances the visual experience.Yet BOTTLE ROCKET falls short in its bid for perfection . For one thing , the love story , while sometimes touching , is very artifical and abstract . At times I really wanted Inez and Anthony to get together , but I could n't help but feel manipulated by the forced nature of their love . Anthony instantly falls in love with the motel housekeeper , who does n't speak a word of English because she 's from Paraguay . The love-at-first-sight gimmick only works when the characters develop a fulfilling emotional bond over time , but this does n't happen in BOTTLE ROCKET . Also , I think Anderson indulges in the 1960 's motif a bit much . From the music to the sets to the hairstyles , everything reeks of the sixties -- hell , even all the cars are vintage . There are points in the film where one could easily forget it was made in '96 . The ending even reminded me of COOL HAND LUKE . But BOTTLE ROCKET , I 've learned , is a very subjective experience and therein lies its genius , at least in part . If you have a well-developed eye , you 'll probably like this film , with varying degrees of enthusiasm . The movie 's much like a bottle rocket , in fact : it can spark , sizzle , and delight , but in the end , you 're not sure whether it could have had more substance . Final note : the DVD is bare-bones . Ca n't we get at least a commentary , people ?	1
This is a mostly well written , acted , and nicely filmed wacky movie . There is nothing deep here just a few bumbling young robber friends . The problem is only one of them wants to really be a great robber and he is a complete moron who ca n't even keep a job mowing lawns . Another is just trying to impress his jerk brother and the third just wants to be a good friend and find a chick to love.The result is a hilarious series of poorly executed robberies , mostly robbing people they know . The last robbery is so over planned and yet completely miscalculated it becomes an absolute mess . I laughed so hard and for so long at the last robbery I almost passed out from a lack of oxygen . This is a fun film with two endearing lead characters.The only criticism I have is the time spent on the love interest . It seemed contrived and added as filler . I suspect the short version is better because it probably severly underplayed or did n't include the love interest at all . But that is really a minor flaw . James Brooks had a hand in the making of this film and the result is something to be proud of .	1
I love this movie for many of the same reasons that other reviews here have listed ... Dignan , the asburdity of his plans , how human and real everyone acts , etc . But another wonderful quality is the beautiful romance between Anthony ( Luke Wilson ) and Inez ( Lumi Cavazos ) . It 's a sweet , and again , REAL portrayal of a breathless yet awkward affair between an Anglo suburban guy who ca n't speak Spanish and a Paraguayan motel cleaner who ca n't really speak English . Still , they both have in common a feeling of drift and aimlessness ( why else would Anthony allow Dignan to involve him in Dignan 's ridiculous schmes ? ) that allows them to form a wordless bond . This is the kind of character portrayal at which the Wilson-Anderson films excel . I must say , though , that I prefer & quot ; Bottle Rocket & quot ; over & quot ; Rushmore & quot ; . Maybe it 's just sentimental because I saw & quot ; Bottle Rocket & quot ; first -- they 're both wonderful films .	1
If we could decide wich movie deserves a special edition , there will be trouble . For example , i think `` alien vs predator '' sucks bigtime , but deserves it ` s special editions cause of both series fans and the tons of extra materials that they can provide , comming often from special effects . Other cult classics have no special effects , but can provide interviews and other info , very useful or appreciated for the fans.This is the case , cause Wes Anderson ` s directional debut is a highly important independent movie , for its style , that gived a whole new perspective of filmaking in low budget for the 90 ` s , i think the film deserves better.This movie deserves a far better edition that this one , that offers nothing besides typical audio and subtitles options . What a shame ! Besides that , the picture and sound quality are very decent in this edition , wich makes this dvd very recomended , but only on the movie ` s own achievement . You won ` t find here anything but a great , important film .	1
Excellent movie . The Passion Fish has great values to share with many . The DVD is an outstanding movie . Thank you for the opportunity to purchase .	1
This movie is probably close to reality of what becoming paralyzed from the waist down would feel like . First , disbelief , then shock , anger , frustration , self pity , bitterness , sadness , and finally resolution and determination . It would have been so easy to exaggerate any one of these stages for dramatic effect , but the actresses are very careful to underplay it and keep it moving .	1
I borrowed this movie along with four or five others from the local library and I kept putting it off and eventually considered simply returning it without even watching it , thinking that it looked kind of sappy and would be a bore to watch . I decided to give it a try the night -- very late in the night , I should say -- before it was due , and boy was I ever wrong . This is one of the most moving and evocative movies that I 've watched in a while , and could not help but watch it through to the end despite the late hour . This is one of the few times when I can say that I feel that a movie was perfectly cast . The acting , the character development is superb , and a nice tight story and excellent script . I most enjoyed the scene on the Bayou to the song Le Danse de Mardi Gras , it was just so beautifully done and the song really evokes the `` fecund '' -- as one minor whimsically puts it when trying to decribe Louisiana -- of the region . This alone makes the movie worth watching .	1
Though it was not a funny as I remember it being when I was much younger , I still enjoyed watching this again .	1
John Candy turns in an amusing performance as the bumbling detective Harry Crumb who is called in to solve the case of a wealthy socialite 's kidnapped daughter . From the very beginning , Crumb 's lack of tact , talent , and detective skills is obvious . He photographs the wrong person on a stake-out , gets stuck in an air conditioning duct , has his tie eaten by a paper shredder , and constantly misuses the words on his word-a-day calendar . While this may not be Candy 's funniest performance , it does provide several stellar comic moments.The supporting cast of this movie is sensational . Superb performances are turned in from Annie Potts , Barry Corbin , Shawnee Smith , and Wesley Mann as the lethargic butler . The finest performance of the movie is accomplished by Jeffrey Jones , who plays the President of Crumb 's detective agency . The interractions he has with the befuddled Harry are outrageous and hilarious.If you are looking for the best of John Candy , I would suggest movies such as & quot ; Planes , Trains , and Automobiles & quot ; or & quot ; Uncle Buck & quot ; instead of this film . & quot ; Who 's Harry Crumb ? & quot ; does have its share of over-the-top moments and comedy that borders on the edge of campy or cheesy . However , more than a few moments of pure hilarity make this film an excellent addition to any movie collection .	1
Annie Potts is scantly clad and hot in this movie . and John Candy is funny in this as well as a good movie .	1
Like many of the movies in this genre ( slapstick comdedy ) , & quot ; Who 's Harry Crumb & quot ; has an absurd story line . But all of this is pretty much inconsequential with a person like John Candy as the star . People who have seen his other performances , know that he can turn the smallest role in to comedic masterpieces ( such as & quot ; Tom Tuttle from Tacoma Washington & quot ; on Volunteers ) . And naturally , when he has a starring role , he can elevate a movie from mediocre to great , as evidenced by this particular movie . Without John Candy , I would rate this movie as one of the 5 worst ever , but since John Candy is in it , it 's in the top 25 ( which is a pretty exclusive list ! ) .All I can say is , if you still hav n't watched this movie , even though it 's been out for almost a dozen years , you 're missing out on a hilarious movie . The first time I watched it , I could n't stop laughing , it 's that funny .	1
Aside from calmly , reasonably confronting a social taboo of the '60s -- racially mixed marriages -- in a thoughtful , touching manner , this film features career-high performances from several of Hollywood 's finest . Spencer Tracy is absolutely brilliant in his final screen appearance as the avowed liberal newspaper publisher Matt Drayton , who , along with his idealistic wife ( a role that earned Katherine Hepburn her second Best Actress Oscar ) learns that their barely-20-year-old daughter is planning to elope with a black physician ( played with cool passion by Sidney Poitier ) . The story evolves from Poitier 's confidence in the two shocked parents that , without their full approval , the marriage will not go on -- and there are only hours to decide . Add his parents to the mix , and as the list of dinner guests grows so does the tension . Aside from the marvelous script , memorable performances and outstanding direction , photography and music there is a chemistry in the mix that truly creates an energy greater than the sum of its parts -- and when the parts are this good , the result is a film for the ages that goes straight to the heart of themes like love , passion , prejudice and family conflict . In the end love does conquor all in Tracey 's powerful final speech , made more poignant by a visibly moved and misty Hepburn -- perhaps cognizant that she was witnessing the final curtain call of a great actor . This is the magic Hollywood is capable of , a movie that re-affirms one 's faith in the ideals of love and equality , and certainly belongs in every collection .	1
The first time I saw this movie , I was in the USAF , based in Vietnam ( 1967-68 ) , viewing it in a mixed audience . To this day , each & every time I watch this movie , it has not lost its importance & true meaning , that LOVE is color blind & knows no bounds ! Very inspirational to me , & always will be ...

1967 's GUESS WHO 'S COMING TO DINNER directed by Stanley Kramer involved the first interracial kiss in screen history . Some reviewers criticized the film 's story of interracial romance , as being unrealistic since Poitier played a black man who had impeccable and unprecedented credentials for the time . This in some people 's minds made the difference of his and his fianc & eacute ; 's race hardly a factor . Kramer pointed out that that was his exactly his point . He wanted to put Poitier and his fianc & eacute ; e on an even playing field where their only differences could only be the color of their skin . Therefore , was there really a difference ? On another level this was Spencer Tracy 's last performance and a heartfelt one at that . Katharine Hepburn stalwartly stands by her gallant partner ( of on and off the screen ) especially during his eloquently spoken last words to all concerned and that deep love and devotion for this now old , bent over and frail man comes through heartbreakingly true . As one time and generation comes to an end another generation and new and changing times come in . This is perhaps not the best film to ever tackle this subject but for its time and place in my generation it is a well intentioned and ever endearing film for me .	1

The problem , of course , is that John is African-American . A perfect son-in-law in every possible way , Joey is absolutely positive her wealthy , liberal ( progressive ) parents will wholeheartedly endorse their 'mixed ' marriage . Wrong ! ! Being progressive was fine as long as it was someone else 's life that was affected . Can the Draytons reconcile their values and the values they raised Joey to live by and the real-life situation at hand ? To complicate matters , John is leaving the country that evening and has told them privately , he will cancel the marriage plans if they do not unreservedly support their marriage before he leaves . Many , if not most , of you are familiar with the story . It was shocking at the time . No black man had ever kissed a white woman on the 'big screen ' . There were 16 states with laws on the books that made interracial marriages illegal . Stanly Kramer was indeed making a social statement with this movie . As a Jewish man , he knew prejudice first hand . As a result of this movie the laws were changed in all 16 states . Do movies influence culture ? ? Remember GIDEON 'S TRUMPET . Watch this movie for what it was-a statement about racial prejudice but also ask yourself where are the injustices today that need to be fixed ? How can we become part of the solution ? A great movie then and still today . [ ... ]	1

R Crumb himself is a very complex character , and the filmmaker did a fantastic job of capturing all sides of him , and the controversies of his comics.Just for a little bit of perspective , I 've never read any of his writings . All I know is what the movie told me . I 'm guessing that makes me unusual , because all his fans surely rushed out to watch this.I also think it 's great.And hey hey hey , what a dysfunctional weird family . I do n't want to say more because that would fall into the `` telling you what to think '' category , which both the movie and its subject avoid.I 'm impressed !	1
This is a great documentary of a great cartoonist.If you are unfamiliar with Crumb 's work this is not theway to get to know him . Better in Blu Ray . I have the originalwhich is much too soft focus . I really loved it.Terry Zwigoff does a great job.Listen Up .	1
In a documentary full of extremely eccentric characters , one must give credit to the director for allowing the viewer to connect with them.A voyage into the unique Crumb family consisting of brilliant minds perplexed by lifetimes of disfunction . Yet , one can leave this movie with some odd sort of understanding that makes the viewer perplexed about himself , as well .	1
Wow ! I knew R. Crumb was off-beat , but I had no idea how much so . And his family is really messed up , much worse off than Robert Crumb . His siters refused to be interviewed forthe film , but his two brothers should be institutionalized . If you question your own weirdness and sanity , take a look at the Crumb family in comparison ; It may cheer you up . Something totally worthwhile is the scene where Crumb is going through his older brother 's comics and notebooks . Want to `` see someone go insane ? '' Here you go . Warning , R. Crumb , and his friends and family 's honesty is commendable yet some viewers may not appreciate the talk of masturbation , racial slurs , and gender roles .	1
What more can you say ? Crumb is definitely a one-of-a-kind individual . Famous for the & # 34 ; Keep On Trucking & # 34 ; poster and the Big Brother and The Holding Company album cover ( you know , the one that made Janice Joplin famous ) . This give you some insight into the strange world of this artist .	1

Thanks Criterion for giving this modern classic the respect it deserves !	1
When I was a teenager growing up in San Diego , R Crumb 's comic books were available in every head shop . It was a lot hipper to have a stack of Crumb 's work stashed away in your room than it was to have a Playboy or a Penthouse . Crumb 's work was misogynistic , sexist , racist , and about as politically incorrect in every way that it could be yet it was the toast of the counterculture.I was visiting friends in Las Vegas when Crumb was first released and saw it while I was there . It made such an impression that I put it on my list of DVDs to own and finally got around to getting my copy this year.Robert Crumb is nothing if not bizarre . On watching the interviews with him , some of his family members , his friends and others around him I got the feeling that his perverted talents developed because of his dysfunctional upbringing rather than despite it . The raw talent was always there , it is just a twist of fate and mind that propelled him to fame as the foremost cartoonist of his generation.Think what you will of his subject matter , his work is undoubtedly great . Crumb taps into a vein of humor that springs from the darkest corners of his imagination and brings it to life in such a way that we can laugh while simultaneously being repelled . Nothing is taboo to Crumb , in fact he seems to revel in the most degenerate imagery . And to think that he is the most normal of the family members who were interviewed for this documentary ! Incredibly , both of his brothers proved weirder than he , the one who still lived at home reminds the viewer of Goober from the Andy Griffith Show only stranger . David Lynch could hardly imagine an odder lot for one of his odder movies . ( Crumb 's sisters declined to be interviewed for the film , probably out of embarassment ) .Since I enjoy Crumb 's work , I found it interesting to discover the things that made him the kind of guy he is . His awkward relations with women undoubtedly color the way he depicts them and its funny that while some of the women interviewed are appalled , others are more philosophical . The film did n't touch on his relations with blacks although his cartoons feature black characters in the crudest caricature imaginable . That I find very ironic , because one of Crumb 's lifelong obsessions has been the promotion and preservation of early black music , particularly the blues.R Crumb is pure mondo bizarro . If you are easily offended , then this documentary is definitely not for you . However , if you are a fan of one of the greatest and most controversial illustrators of the second half of the twentieth century and would like to find out what makes him tick , you may find this film to be quite a revelation .	1
I have to believe that if you are off-put by Crumb 's art ( the headless women with monstrous thighs ; the caricatures of blacks as wild jungle-dwellers ) , or find his frank admissions of & quot ; perverse & quot ; sexual attractions uncomfortable , or find yourself with a wardrobe full of San Francisco 49er memorabilia , then you will be put off by Crumb 's character as well.I 'm not . He 's fascinating.Director Terry Zwigoff gets a lot of mileage out of Crumb 's reactions to situations . Whether it 's the confused and perplexed look he gets from watching the parade of shallow consumers he sees on the streets , or his half-sincere/half-uncomfortable bursts of laughter following bizarre tales from his youth , Crumb 's expressive face says more than his mouth ever could . This , combined with his wonderfully laid-back voice ( at once sarcastic and self-deprecating and tinged with regret ) makes me wonder why it 's taken so long for this man to get some camera time . Self-imposed exile , I suppose . He 's definitely a star.The opening sequence over the credits is the lone contrived moment in an otherwise truthful film . It begins by showing a series of porcelain sculptures modeled on Crumb 's most recognizable characters , followed by a shadowy shot of Robert , sitting in a near-fetal position , listening to one of his many old time blues records . It is the only moment in the film that feels fake , and threatens to ruin the film 's credibility right from the starting gate . Thankfully , director Zwigoff has a perfect game the rest of the way.And there is only one moment that puts objectivity aside and allows for a bit of commentary on the part of the filmmakers . It concerns an interview with Deirdre English , a former editor of the magazine 'Mother Jones ' . She gives her opinion ( along with shown examples ) of Crumb 's supposed racism . Zwigoff precedes this with footage of Crumb complaining that the only people who found these comics offensive were white liberals , e.g . Ms. English herself . Otherwise , Zwigoff uses an even hand in his portrayals.Other than the legacy Crumb will leave with his innovative work , the film focuses heavily on his family life ( or lives ) .What the heck was in the water at the Crumb house ? Besides Robert and his well-known proclivities , his lesser known siblings have serious problems of their own . Older brother Charles , still living at home with his overbearing mother at the time the film was shot , admits to a severe reliance on tranquilizers , and baths biannually . Younger brother Maxon ( whose role in the Crumb boys ' childhood comics company was & quot ; supply boy & quot ; ) , lives alone in a dive hotel and spends his days cleansing his colon with a long strip of cloth while sitting on a bed of nails ( two sisters declined to be interviewed ) . Upon seeing the devastating dysfunction of the apples that fell from the Crumb family tree , one begins to wonder not how odd Robert turned out , but rather how normal . It 's the film 's most startling revelation.Some of the most touching moments are those of Crumb with his own kids . Young daughter Sophie , the only woman Crumb 's ever loved , receives her fathers gentle affection willingly . Son Jesse sports the costume of the hippies that Crumb so despised ( long hair and dirty beard ) , but his artistic talent more than makes up for this transgression in his father 's eyes . One moment has the two men competing in a contest to best reproduce a photo of an ugly insane woman . Contrast the unsettling subject matter of the photo , with Robert 's sincere artistic advice to his son on how to draw out its interesting elements , and you get a wonderful scene of iconoclastic domesticity. & quot ; Crumb & quot ; , the film , like Crumb , the artist , manages to combine humour and tragic sadness in a cohesive whole . It is at once repellent and mesmerizing , encompassing nearly every aspect of humanity . From the perverse to the pleasant , it all seems somewhat , well , Natural . A truly astonishing feat from a truly astonishing documentary film .	1
`` Crumb '' is a movie where you must learn to read beneath the lines as to who this artist is . Nothing about this man is as what it seems initially . But if you study this movie ( as it is a film to be studied ) you will realize the malice R.Crumb puts into his artwork is directed solely at the attitudes of society . And that includes every aspect and every class of people . It does n't seem to matter who they are . He is an artist that details everything he sees with frightening clarity and no regard for diplomacy . It 's an ability not confined to gender or color . His comics read like an illustrated passage of a diary . As you dig more into his backround ( the film is NOT the last word on him ) you realize that no one is exempt from his wrath . Not men , not women , not ethnics . After reading several reviews and chats about what they observed in this film , it 's obvious that many viewers took what they saw at face value.Looking at his artwork you realize R.Crumb combined the look of innocent comic strips of the early 20th century with more explicit content common today . No one else at the time had thought of drawing this way . The comic book industry in the 60 's was becoming increasingly progressive . The old look of comics , Lil Abner or Little Orphan Annie for example , were considered passe.The inspiration for R.Crumb 's art comes from a deeply dysfunctional family . It was n't an overly violent family but it was a morbidly depressing one . You learn that the problems Robert and his siblings had stemmed from the fact that their house was dominated by a father who saw manhood in only one way and was not lenient in his views to accomodate any of his sons ' artistic potential . As Robert pointed out , when his father came home from work any blip of a happy man dissapeared as soon as he entered the door . When it came to encouragement or artistic development all five children had only each other and were left to their own devices . Robert became the success perhaps because he , unlike Charles for instance , saw his talent as a way to define himself and not simply as a means of profit . He chose the format ( comics ) he knew best to make his point.The bulk of his material consists of two main topics : his family and women . His attitudes on women are far more complicated . His unpopularity with girls as a teen is due to a result of his inability to fashion himself into something they wanted visually . And he was equally frustrated at THEIR apparent inability to ignore those instincts and see him for the good person he felt he was . It has led to lifelong love/hate relationship with the opposite sex . One that is defined by pure lust and no real affection for females for who they are except in the case of his daughter Sophie.His views on blacks and the never ending debate as to whether or not he is racist is not given nearly as much screentime.He denounces the critism he has garnered by saying `` it all came from white liberals . '' That 's not exactly an ideal way of defending yourself in a largely white liberal society . Neither he , nor Terry Zwigoff ( who made this movie ) , give a straight answer to the charge and leave other artists to answer for Crumb . But if you take into account Crumb 's true love of black music ( specifically , delta blues of 30 's ) it becomes harder to pin the `` racist '' label on him . Still , the movie lets him off a bit easy , its only flaw.Other aspects of his life such as his open marriage to wife Aline , his strained relationship with his son Jesse , and the overall study of the underground comix scene that he helped spawn are present but not as prominently featured . Engrossing , but somewhat incomplete , `` Crumb '' is an indepth character study of a truly misunderstood man .	1
Robert Crumb is well known as one of the pioneers of the underground comic book era of the 1960s , and his `` Keep On Truckin ' '' logo is still well-known today . His comics were ( and still are ) , bizarre , outrageous , shocking , and often offensive . But the story of real-life creator of such psychedelic highlights as Zap Comics and Fritz the Cat is so weird and unusual in itself , you 'll remember it for a long time to come . ( Robert Crumb describes the Church of the SubGenius as the only religion he could consider joining . ) Terry Zwigoff 's masterful portrayal of Crumb is presented in such a manner that even as you 're shocked at some of the things he draws ( e.g . Mr. Natural in `` A Bitchin ' Bod '' ) , you see that compared to the other people in his family , he looks almost normal . It 's presented in a modest , low-key style that you ca n't tear your eyes away from after you start watching it . The scene of Crumb 's brother Max eating cloth while sitting on a bed of nails is strangely entrancing .	1
Being a fan of Robert Crumb since the 1970 's , I had to have this film . And it 's actually an excellent documentary about the father of the underground comic . Sometimes funny , sometimes sad , sometimes revealing but always interesting .	1
This documentary is like crossing Intervention with David Lynch . Showcasing the amazing talents of Robert Crumb and the equally amazing mental issues of his family . It 's not pornographic in any way .	1
Crumb is one of the strangest , saddest , and most honest documentaries I 've ever seen . I was really impressed by how the filmmakers did not attempt to make Robert Crumb out to be a genius , but were n't trying to bring him down a peg either . They were simply showing him as he is . You have to decide what you think of him.The image and sound are in fairly rough condition , but Criterion has done an excellent job ( as they always do ) .The extras are informative and entertaining . The commentary with Roger Ebert and Terry Zwigoff is a real treat , in particular.This a film that must be seen , and this blu-ray is the best way possible .	1
A celebrationof the creative proccessand strange families .	1
I probably ca n't say anything that has n't been said in the previous reviews , but ... what an amazing documentary . It tells the story of Robert Crumb , a famous underground cartoonist who began his career in the San Francisco area in the 60s . We learn about his youth , the history of his work , and get to meet his family , including his wife , ex-wife , and children ( with the exception of his sisters , but who could blame them for not partaking in this ) .And what a family it is . Wow . As odd as he is ( and that 's ODD ! ) , his family takes the cake . One brother is probably near genius intelligence , reads voraciously , does n't shower , does n't leave the house , is suicidal and psychopathic , tells about his homicidal thoughts , is on medication , and lives in a house with their mother and at least one cat . I could almost smell the funk that must have been that house . I wonder how the crew did it . The other lives alone in an apartment in San Francisco , has obvious high intelligence also , paints , practices yoga , sits and meditates on a bed of nails ( in public ) , has a history of uncontrollable lewd behavior ( he describes for a about once de-skirting a woman in public ) , and does n't seem to have any other friends either . Watching Crumb visit with these people is one of the oddest things I have ever seen . He understands them and is willing to talk to them about anything in front of the camera . During their conversations he often looks at us almost disbelievingly and with a smirk , as if to say , I may be nuts , but not THIS nuts ! Like he 's in on the joke with us . But strangley enough , so are his brothers ; they KNOW they 're screwed up.There are abundant shots of his cartoons here , and they are definitely for a select audience . He 's not a children 's cartoonist . Mysogynistic is too subtle to describe his work . We get to see him working and he takes us through and explains some of his previous work . It 's fascinating.By the end , we have had an incredible view into the life of Robert Crumb and , love him or hate him , one has to be in awe . Compared to his family , this is a men who has done very well for himself and has used his talent as a cartoonist to assuage the demons that may have overcome him like they did his brothers.This is a high recommendation . Although it 's not necessarily a buy recommendation , so I only give it four stars . It at least should be rented . You 'll be amazed , guaranteed .	1
I 'll admit , I was skeptical . A friend of mine swore that I would love this movie and I doubted it heavily . Whenever my wife and I would visit him he would offer to throw in his DVD of Hudson Hawk and we would beg off , claiming anything from work to do at home to severe stomach cramps . That 's how badly we wanted to avoid this film.One rainy Tuesday afternoon , during my third month of unemployment this friend of mine and I went out for lunch and some DVD shopping . After finishing up we went back to his house and kicked back . He made his usual attempt to convince me to watch Hudson Hawk and for some reason known only to God and the demons that live in my subconscious I said yes . It was one of my most enjoyable movie experiences ever.It 's almost impossible to put into words why I like this movie . It totally defies definition . It is a screwball comedy with a crime caper at it 's center and a Secret Service Nun as it 's femme fatale . The music is fun and fits well into the pace and scheme of the movie and the running cappucino gag is lame and contrived yet amazingly fun.It is really an experience that has to be enjoyed first hand . Go out and rent this film if you can . I would just advise buying it outright . It 's cheap enough and you wo n't be disappointed.Now I just have to find a night when my wife is n't that busy or suffering gastric distress so she can enjoy it too .	1
Hudson Hawk is an incredible film that is widely immitated and emulated in different forms and incarnations , but is a singularly hillarious film . Elements of the DaVinci Code , Alias , and modern action-slapstick comedies can be traced back to this gem of a film.If you like films that mix tones : comedy , action , drama , mystery , etc . then Hudson Hawk is the perfect film for you .	1
I first caught this over the top , truly underrated movie on a UHF-TV channel one Saturday afternoon when the baseball game had been rained out . It was a hilarious , so critics nor box office failure do n't translate a bad movie . Burce Willis had a hidden talent that was never fully exploited by Hollyweird . The film itself is toungue in cheek musical comedy . So , if you like to see a irreligious riotous look at the `` Cat Bugular '' 60 's film noir for a Saturday afternoon ( as I did ) , that this is a film you should see . Buy it used and save a buck or two - eh , for the popcorn ...	1
& quot ; Under it my genius is rebuked & quot ; - William Shakespeare : MACBETH : Act III , Scene 1When Bruce Willis ' 1991 film , HUDSON HAWK , opened to poor reviews and a small box-office take , it was due largely to the fact that audiences were expecting another DIE HARD - another slam-bang Summer action-fest - and were not prepared for the sophistication required to comprehend ( let alone enjoy ) the twisting account of Eddie & quot ; The Hawk & quot ; Hawkins ' quest for his own Holy Grail . Just as Dickens was originally considered the equivalent of modern-day pulp fiction , so too was HUDSON HAWK initially scorned ( if not overlooked entirely ! ) . And again , just as Dickens eventually gained recognition for his skills in story-crafting , so too is HUDSON HAWK ; slowly coming to be know as a well-crafted tale employing several great and classic themes of our culture and its literature.Eddie 's tale begins when after years of exclusion from society , he finally returns and begins the search for the one thing that society has that can make him whole again : a cappuccino . Many audiences , at first blush , will not catch this detail and hence , lose all understanding of the film 's purpose . Now this cappuccino is metaphorical and indicative of something in all our lives - it is that thing ( different for each of us ) for which we yearn with an unquenchable longing ; and so , a simple caffeinated beverage is a perfect device , for anything less material or more important would dilute this sense of metaphor.Just as in all classic works , a great many obstacles arise to thwart this protagonist in his quest for his true desire . Whereas some of these obstacles are larger than life ( a couple of would-be world conquerors ) and directly assault him to keep him from his destined prize , others ( a love interest ) work through subtlety and quietly distract him from his path . These are both classic story-telling techniques : Odysseus had his Cyclops and Alec Leamas had his Liz . The key interest , though , is that HUDSON HAWK is careful to make the point that while some obstacles must be done away with entirely , others can be drawn into a sort of cohesion with the prize and they are never necessarily mutually exclusive.Besides the use of classical themes of the culture , HUDSON HAWK demonstrates a wonderful talent at character exposition and utilizes traditional literary devices - the most notable of which is the absolutely blatant use of a 'deus ex machina ' ending . All said , if film ( as I 've long maintained ) is in fact the literature of the modem culture , HUDSON HAWK stands as a bastion of innovative literary quality .	1
And cheesy special effects ! But this movie held my attention throughout ! Van Damme , playing a fashion tycoon 's right hand man , helps the CIA track Russian terrorists who are using counterfiet goods to smuggle explosives ( nano-bombs according to the script ) to the US to cause a massive terrorist bomb plot . And the action comes thick and fast , including a rickshaw race , a van demolishing a supermarket and a great fight scene in a cargo ship . Van Damme displays his martial arts skills well , but this is n't his finest moment ( that 's reserved for SUDDEN DEATH and KICKBOXER ! ) . Overall , well worth seeing , especially for tha cinematography .	1
i love this movie . Its full of quirky characters , jack Lemon is crazy hilarious , and a smoldering Kim Novak . Great halloween romance movie	1
What could be better than this ? Great stars and I love the story . I have watched this movie at least 10 times in the past 20 years .	1
Bell , Book and Candle should be interesting to a new audience today because of the recent interest in magic and the occult . Since it did not take these matters too seriously , it was an enjoyable romantic romp .	1
the cast is great and the story fun . And little different twist on the love story : )	1
What a breath of fresh air this supernatural romantic comedy is . The affable Jimmy Stewart and the effortlessly-glamorous Kim Novak light up the screen with their great chemistry . Charismatic Jack Lemmon also raises a smile in an early role . With a witty script and a likeably eccentric cast of characters , this little curio from the fifties is a gem that 's well worth seeking out . Definitely a classic that brings out a little bit of the hidden bohemian in all of us !	1
** Mild spoilers ahead **Gillian Holroyd ( Kim Novak ) runs a little primitve art shop in Greenwich Village , on the first floor of a building also shared by Shep Henderson ( James Stewart ) , a publisher , and her aunt Queenie ( Elsa Lanchester ) . She likes Shep a lot but admires him from a distance until an odd problem with his phone on Christmas Eve - engineered by busybody Queenie - sends him to her shop to use hers . They take a liking to each other , and he decides to find her at the club she 's going to with her aunt that evening - accompanied by his girlfriend Merle ( Janie Rule ) . Gillian 's brother Nicky ( Jack Lemmon ) plays the bongos in the house jazz band at the club , which is filled with all kinds of weird people - very weird as it turns out , because it 's a club for witches . Soon Gillian sets her sights on taking Shep away from Merle - who she 's loathed since they knew each other in college - and Nicky gets involved in helping to write a book about `` their kind of people '' with drunken occult writer Sidney Redlitch ( Ernie Kovacs ) who has been summoned suddenly to New York by Gillian 's spell . Troubles ensue ... Director Richard Quine 's romantic comedy reteams Stewart and Novak immediately after Alfred Hitchcock 's VERTIGO , which was released 7 months earlier . Obviously there are some fascinating comparisons to be made ; the first and most obvious is that both are films about romantic obsessions , in both cases brought about initially by deceptions on the part of Novak 's character . Both films also feature a frustrated second woman in the life of Stewart 's character - Midge ( Barbara Bel Geddes ) in Vertigo and Merle in this film - and though their functions are otherwise fairly different , interestingly enough both are artists . Obviously this film is a comedy , and one will correctly assume that it 's not going to have an unhappy or tragic ending , but like VERTIGO it does keep one guessing as to the specific nature of it 's ending up until the last few minutes . Both films have scenes with the Stewart characters finding out about the true nature of the Novak characters , getting angry and refusing to accept it - though , again , the consequences are radically different . And both films have gotten flack for the characters that Novak plays - for being sexist or too accepting of the patriarchal norm ; in both cases Novak 's character tries to assert herself , and faces negative consequences.Or so it might seem . In BELL BOOK AND CANDLE we 're told several times that a witch ( or warlock - apart from the name , no distinction is made between the sexes and their abilities or places in the world of magic ) will lose her ( or his ) powers , become `` human '' if s/he falls in love . So Gillian ultimately falling for Shep - as opposed to just casting a spell on him - can be seen as a sign of feminine weakness , giving up her power for the traditional female role . Not a completely invalid reading but - it 's a little more complicated . One of the things I like about this film is that we 're not seeing a group of all-powerful , dominating witches , but a group of fairly pathetic people scrounging around like the rest of humanity . Gillian may lose her powers but - so what ? They do n't help her brother much , or her aunt , who both seem to live in a genteel sort of poverty . And I think that if the film is telling us anything about what `` magic '' is , it 's that love is a kind of magic and force that 's mysterious and incredibly potent - and that real feeling is more powerful than any spell.The film also gets it 's share of disparaging `` Stewart 's too old '' sorts of remarks , but I have to say that Stewart actually looks - and acts - a little younger here than he did in the previous film - and Novak comes across as much older , or at least much more mature and self-assured . So this was n't really a problem for me . The cast all in all is excellent ; Kovacs not surprisingly almost steals the show as the non-stop yammering and drinking writer , Lemmon is his usual somewhat smarmy and yet lovable self , Lanchester and Hermione Gingold - as a famous witch who turns out mostly to have the power of self-promotion - are both delightful . Stewart does well in a role that I 'm not sure he 's perfect for ; a decade of playing mostly darker roles leaves him a little too intense sometimes , and a little too self-conscious for this lighter material . I think he does fine - but I 'm thinking perhaps a Cary Grant or even Rock Hudson might have done as well.So ultimately , it 's Kim Novak who is the real star and draw here , playing every bit as mysterious , sexy-but-vulnerable and beautiful as she is in VERTIGO . It 's not a role that requires quite the range , and it does n't go to places as dark , but it is something that requires a high level of agility , to be able to stay away from coming off as too demanding or controlling , and yet to never appear weak , and she manages it brilliantly . Having rewatched the Hitchcock film recently also , I have to say it 's a total mystery to me as to why she did n't become the biggest star in Hollywood - she had the beauty , the ability to play comedy and drama , and a powerful mysterious sexiness . Maybe - despite playing `` fake '' characters in a couple of her best-known roles - she was just too real for the phoniness of Tinseltown.This is a fine transfer and you should n't hesitate to acquire it , but I should tell you that the brand-newThe Kim Novak Collectionis supposed to have an upgraded transfer , along with other must-sees like PICNIC and PAL JOEY . If you 're a serious Novak fan , that 's the set to get .	1
Jimmy Stewart , Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon jazzin ' in the Zodiac in technicolor 1958 NYC . Great comedy forerunner of `` Bewitched '' ( maybe ) , with the great Ernie Kovacs thrown in the mix . A little slim on the extra features , but plenty of bongos to make everything alright . This Twilight Time blu-ray is Pyewacket 's pajamas as far as the audio/visual quality is concerned , so get it ... .	1
This movie is classic . It a great christmas story with a non religious point of view . Kim Novak is very bewitching performance . Jack Lemmon is funny and fantastic as usual . It is placed in the late fifties showing the indie , beatnik and the underground art of that time period . It 's ambiance is great . Lots of vintage glamour . James Stewart plays the same lovable character . It is great romance and good look into a different take of looking at how witches are in this story . I recommend it to old movie enthusiasts or people who love love story 's and glamour as well as a supernatural theme .	1
This movie is great fun for those of you who enjoyed movies in the late 50 's and early 60 's . One of Jack Lemmon 's earliest movies , he is great in his secondary roll as Kim Novak 's warlock brother . This film was made around the same time that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made the Hitchcock classic , Vertigo , and their onscreen chemistry is just as wonderful in this cleverly written , light comedy , as it was in the dark and riveting Hitchcock thriller . Even the musical score takes you back to a time when movies really were the perfect fare for escapism , instead of the sometimes nauseating food for depression that some films can be today . Enjoy.They truly DO N'T make 'em like this anymore .	1
Jimmy Stewart never made a bad movie -- -- but in my opinion , this is alllllllllllllll Kim Novak 's film , and her very best flick . Whomever cast this movie , was brilliant . Jack Lemmon is the perfect choice in playing opposite Novak as her brother , and Jimmy Stewart is also perfectly cast as her very skeptical , cynical love-interest . Throw in Elsa Lancaster , cast as Aunt Queenie , and you really have perfection in a movie cast with actors who make you believe in Magic .	1
& quot ; Bell , Book and Candle & quot ; ( BBC ) is a very pleasant comedy , given an enormous boost from a formidable cast . In fact , much of my four-star rating is based on the actors involved , and their performances . Notwithstanding many glowing reviews , this is not a classic film and all of the key actors have made better movies.I understand that BBC is based on a play . I hope that the stage version also had a strong cast , because the plot is really very slight . Jimmy Stewart is a book publisher who does n't know that his apartment building is inhabited by a couple of witches played by the gorgeous Kim Novak and her nosy & quot ; aunt & quot ; , Elsa Lanchester . When Kim finds that she is attracted to Jimmy , and discovers that his fiancee is a nasty former school mate , she decides to seduce him . Do n't worry Mom and Dad -- this is 1958 -- the & quot ; seduction & quot ; is totally & quot ; PG & quot ; . We also meet Kim 's & quot ; warlock & quot ; brother in a local night club -- a bongo-playing Jack Lemmon , as droll as ever . Then we have Ernie Kovacs as an author with a big interest in witchcraft and booze , not necessarily in that order ! Such a shame that Mr. Kovacs passed away at an early age -- a major loss for film and television comedy . Finally , as the & quot ; grande dame & quot ; of witches , Hermione Gingold steals scenes in her gloriously theatrical way.I 'm convinced that Jimmy Stewart could have read a telephone book for two hours , and still be watchable and entertaining . His character is required to look befuddled , perplexed , indignant and incredulous -- qualities that Mr. Stewart could raise to an art form . He also has a number of scenes where he is & quot ; required & quot ; to kiss Ms. Novak passionately -- and to think he got paid for this as well ? ! Many beautiful women became movie stars in the 50s -- Marilyn Monroe is a legend -- Elizabeth Taylor -- Ava Gardner -- Rhonda Fleming -- Grace Kelly -- it 's a long list . For this reviewer though , Kim Novak was the most stunning woman on screen . In this film -- and others -- her presence is electric . Jimmy Stewart does n't have a chance ! I should add that Ms. Novak was a recent guest on & quot ; Larry King Live & quot ; -- yes , guys -- she is still a knockout ! The DVD is nice , rather than outstanding -- the colours exhibit some haziness here and there -- mono sound , of course . This is not a great film , but if you want to spend a couple of pleasant , undemanding hours with this delightful cast -- Stewart , Lemmon , Kovacs , Lanchester , Gingold and the truly magical Ms. Novak -- you will not be disappointed .	1
I received the DVD in record time and in wonderful condition , very pleased as I purchased it for a dear friend who had the VHS of this film and her VHS player bit the dust so this was an wonderful choice as a surprise gift .	1
I have been wanting to see this movie for years . I 've read the book many times . Overall , I really liked the movie . No Academy Award winner but it kept my interest . I will watch it again .	1
I loved Stephen King 's Different Seasons , except for one thing . I always thought that the story APT PUPIL was about fifty pages too long . The film version takes care of this concern , distilling PUPIL down to it 's basic elements : old evil passing itself on to a young , all too eager student . Ian McKellen ( yep , Gandolf himself ! ) is perfectly , quietly malevolent as the ancient nazi war criminal , hiding out in suburbia . Brad Renfro plays Todd Bowden , the normal-looking high school kid , concealing a darkness that appears to be insatiable and without limits . Todd fools his family , friends , and guidance counselor ( David Schwimmer ) , into believing he is just another highly gifted teenager . In reality , he is a sociopathic wretch , coasting along by gaining the misplaced trust of others . Studying the holocaust in history class brings out Todd 's blackened interior , causing him to hunt down and ensnare McKellen 's character . What follows is a study of twisted evil in the midst of apparent normalcy . Todd and his `` teacher '' develop a seemingly symbiotic relationship that is in actuality purely parasitic . They are destroying each others souls . APT PUPIL 's horror lies in it 's use of demonic evil in broad daylight . Most of the movie is played out in the sunny afternoon . Evil does n't wait for nightfall . It hides in plain sight , looking clean-cut and well-adjusted ...	1
Once upon a time many years ago , a fictional French baroness smirked as her paramour pronounced his undying devotion to his Lady Fair : his dedication to her , his wonderment in the face of her not inconsiderable charms . His -- -Love.To which she replied , tartly : `` Love -- -I do n't like the word 'Love ' . I prefer the word 'Cruelty'.So do I . And so does the world , if the genocide raging through Africa is any kind of case in point . We live in a world where terrorists ram planes into skyscrapers because of grievances , and the question raised by our 'elites ' is not `` how do we destroy these barbarians '' , but rather a whining , sniveling `` why do hey hate us ? `` ? Is not Cruelty , then , our due ? The real question is not why the Holocaust happened , but , in the words of Max von Sydow 's artist in `` Hannah and her Sisters '' , why it does n't happen more often . `` Apt Pupil '' is one of the most harrowing , horrifying , repulsive films I have ever watched.The blood does n't flow like claret and the gore does n't cake the walls , but a warning : `` Apt Pupil '' is not for the faint of heart.That said , Singer has an exceedingly subtle touch with distills one of Stephen King 's best short stories into an engaging and particularly nasty piece of cinema that bores deep into the fundamental cruelty that feeds and nourishes human evil.Tod Bowden ( played with understatement and sublime nastiness by Brad Renfro ) is a high school student who discovers that an elderly German man -- -who might just be an infamous Nazi war criminal -- -is living in his quiet Southern California neighborhood . Bowden confronts his reclusive neighbor , presents evidence of his past as the notorious Gestapo officer Kurt Dussander ( impeccably played by Sir Ian McKellen , in a kind of decrepit stepladder of Evil ) , and by degrees blackmails , coerces , and ultimately flatters the old man into telling him about his atrocities during the war.The movie that follows is a superbly paced and increasingly psycho-sexual ballet between the boy and the old Nazi , who is at once Bowden 's mentor , idol , victim , and catalyst . Both Renfro and McKellen are so perfectly cast and so competent in their roles that the viewer is made uneasy by the way the two seem to feed off each other , glutting themselves with stories of past horrors -- -and growing stronger with the telling.Particularly awful is the scene where Bowden buys Dussander an SS costume as a 'present ' , and then cajoles him into dressing in it and marching . What initially begins as an embarrassed reluctance to even don the uniform turns into a manic peformance , and as Bowden demands that Dussander stop , the old man whispers `` be careful boy -- -you 're playing with fire . '' Indeed.Is n't it amazing how the grey terrible ringlets of age , the coils of venerability , fall off , boiled down to the core of a psychotic creature willing , able , and gleeful -- -to maim , torture , and destroy ? The brilliance of `` Apt Pupil '' is in the way the film distills the essence of cruelty , particularly in two scenes . While I will not spoil the film by talking about either scene , both involve McKellen and Renfro in acts of shocking , amoral , sociopathic savagery to a wounded bird and a cat.When I watched the scenes , I had an epiphany -- -the source of depravities like the Holocaust , or the Stalinist purges , or the genocide in Rwanda has never been about race , or religion , or politics , or tribe -- -all of it stems from a dark desire by some men to inflict brutality on the weak , for no better reason than they derive pleasure from doing it.Because they can get away with it . Because they take all they can grab.This philosophy underscores `` Apt Pupil '' , and is , in my opinion , the reason the film succeeds so well at painting a realistic picture of human horror . Renfro 's Tod Bowden is not a young Nazi ; like the killers at Columbine High School , he is a bored coward with too much time on his hands and a decidedly cruel streak.The acting is excellent throughout , with David Schwimmer ( of Friends ) perfectly cast as hapless Jewish high school guidance counselor , and Elias Koteas taking on yet another repulsive role as one of McKellen 's vagrant victims . Like `` American Psycho '' , `` Apt Pupil '' is not an exit , and the film offers no easy answers , leaving the uneasy viewer with a disturbing coda which prompts a question : is cruelty a force that can be harnessed for power ? And ultimately , in an empty universe , where the voice of God is silent , why not ? JSG	1
A good dark drama , 16 year-old student recogines an old man living in his home town to be a hunted Nazi . If you like Stephen King you 'll like this chilling story of psychological terror .	1
This adaptation of a Stephen King novella is very underrated , and I think it 's due to the fact that it touches on some very mature issues . Instead of ghosts and demonic clowns , we have the Nazis and the Holocaust . This is a very dark film that focuses on a high school student from the 80 's whose deep fascination with Nazism brings him close to one of his neighbors : a Nazi war criminal named Kurt Dussander . I did n't really care much about this film when it was still released on VHS . But now that I look back on Apt Pupil , I see it as an immensely powerful film that 's been neglected for far too long . It has a deep and disturbing story , some incredibly good performances by Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro ( R.I.P . ) , and some truly thought-provoking moments . Again , this should have never been overlooked . It 's a very good film .	1
Apt Pupil is a thrilling movie that juxtaposes suburban life with the evil and corruption of a Nazi war criminal . The two leads are excellent actors . Brad Renfro plays a high school student who blackmails a Nazi war criminal ( the outstanding Ian McKellen ) into telling him everything ( the who , the why , the where ) of his crimes against humanity.Of course , life ca n't be as simple as that , and a high school student is n't going to get the upper hand on a masterful , depraved man . The two men form a fascinating friendship , countered by their opposing viewpoints on history . Apt Pupil delivers some brilliant twists in which each man must determine his own destiny.This is hands down the best adaptation of a Stephen King plotline . Do n't miss out on this gem of a movie . If you enjoy this , try American History X .	1
I liked this movie for all of the chills and twists in it . The problem that I did have with it was not really feeling for any of the characters , but that was probably the way that King wrote the story . The younger man , Todd Bowden coming into an older gentleman 's home and threatening him with `` exposure '' . Then plot twists and the older gentleman , Kurt Dussander turning and threatening Todd with exposure of knowing he was a war criminal . What I did like is that they did come to the realization that they were both benefiting from each other 's company in some way . This movie is a Stephan King classic and I did like it very much . I do recommend it to anyone that likes psychological thrillers .	1
There are a few Stephen King adaptations that are good , though most missed the mark . I thought Bryan Singer 's vision of `` Apt Pupil '' left in ( and left out ) everything that was approprate . I admire Ian McKellan no end , and he did not disappoint . I always thought that Brad Renfro 's auspicious debut in `` The Client '' would lead to great things . Here , he succeeds . It 's a layered performance of unsettling discovery , conflict & resolution ... and a few surprises . Elias Koteas , in a small role , was best of all . His role as street person/hustler was complete , and I must admit that his final scene lef me a bit unsettled , very sad . I will not blab anyhing away , but I thought this to be a fine and very upsetting film . I 'm somewhat amused at the controversy involving Singer 's shower room scene , where he asked a number of young males to appear nude ( they signed affidavits of approval ) . No one really cared , except one guy sued him for misreprentation or whatever . ( How humiliating was that for him ? ) This was a 1998 film . Brian de Palma 's `` Carrie '' with Oscar-nominee Sissy Spacek ( 1976 ) had a brutal shower scene , full-frontal , the whole 9 yards , and nobody made issue . Nudity does n't bother me , if it makes sense . I do n't understand the fuss .	1
The death of Brad Renfro shocked me . I watched this and other films by him , but by far this is a remendous achievement and it 's a shame he did n't get the press or attention other celebrities get when they pass on . His role in this film demonstrates his tremendous acting ability , although it was n't realized by the powers that be in Hollywood.I 'll miss him , but I have his films to keep his memory fresh in my mind .	1
I saw this picture back in the 70 's when it first came to cable . It was on a total of eight times and I watched it each and every time . There is an electric energy here between Faye Dunaway and Tommie Lee Jones that can not be denied . The story is fantastic and the 70 's chic shines through . It is also quite a good twister . Every scene is dynamic cinematically and the title sequence is just great . By the way , the song sung by the incomparable Barbra Streisand , was originally supposed to be a part of `` A Star Is Born '' but it was cut . Thank goodness , because it fits just perfectly here and I could not imagine another song in its place . Get this movie , you will not be disappointed . I loved every minute of it .	1
This was the movie that made me want to move to New York ( hey , I was in grade school at the time ) . Perfectly capturing the look of glam '70 's in a way that other , more famous 70 's movies did n't , this thriller delivers some real scares . Faye Dunaway is actually pretty good as the beleagured Laura Mars . She overacts in a few scenes , but for the most part is n't bad at all . Tommy Lee Jones is great as the detective that falls for her , and the supporting cast , while a little cardboard , are n't too bad ( except for the dead model 's boyfriend at the funeral- while the cops wrestle him to the ground , he practically yodels his line & quot ; you 're gonnnnaaa paaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy ! & quot ; while Faye dives into the limo to avoid the paparazzi ) , and the look of the movie ; the clothes , the sets , all have a dark , glossy richness that remind us that & quot ; Saturday Night Fever & quot ; was not the way everybody dressed back then . The quality of the DVD is not great , and there is no stereo , but it 's a well-priced disc , and a pretty fun movie . I wish they 'd re-relase the soundtrack to it .	1
`` Eyes of Laura Mars '' may be a flawed picture to some degree , but it 's a great semi-kinky period piece [ only `` semi '' by today 's standards ] , the actors are good and paranoid and appropriately overwrought , and there is an atmosphere that holds this well-directed/well-edited film together.The only faults are a couple minor quirks in the script -- like you can tell whodunit almost right away.Irvin Kirschner , the very intelligent director who guided this ( as well as `` Empire Strikes Back '' , etc.. ) , provides a non-stop commentary track which is interesting.My main complaint with the DVD : as a double-sided disc , you have the option of watching it on the square `` full screen '' shaped for TV , or the ALLEGED widescreen -- - but the widescreen here is actually the square TV-version only with the 'heads and feet ' cut-off in letterbox style ... In other words , you 're not only missing the SIDES of the picture [ as you do in a standard square TV print , of course ] but they 've lopped off the top and bottom to create a pseudo-widescreen version , which means you 're missing a major part of the picture from ALL FOUR SIDES ! ( As a result , the standard , square TV version has more visual data ... . but neither side of the disc gives you the actual original widescreen theatre version . )	1
I first saw `` La Bamba '' via YouTube and it was all in spanish accept for the singing parts . Then I saw it again recently on cable TV and recorded it and I thought it was va really good movie the second time I watched it . The first time I watched it , m It was just plain boring just because it was all spoken in spanish accept for the songs in it . A great story about how Ritchie Valens became a tallented person . R.I.P . Ritchie . You Will Be Missed . Peter Smith	1
The life story of Ritchie Valens and his climb up the charts . Ritchie dies in the plane crash that took Buddy Holly and J.P.Richardson ( the Big Bopper ) .grace2u	1
I just watched 'La Bamba ' and have only one comment to make : if this is the Sonny Bono story , why does it star Lou D. Phillips ? He does n't look anything like him and where did I miss Cher in this story ? He never sang any of those songs , and they show him dying way before he really did and not in the same way . Sonny Bono died in a skiing accident , not in a plane crash in Iowa . My god , whoever wrote this got the plot completely wrong , the characters grossly confused with other ones , and the time line all wrong . If this had been the Richie Valens story , it would be pretty accurate . Over all , I 'll give it a 5 for effort . I 'm off now to do commentary on the 'Richie Valens Story ' which has somehow got Sonny Bono and Cher in the starring roles ...	1
This was a touching film about the short life of rock & roll star Ritchie Valens . Lou Diamond Phillips was awesome as the young musician and Los Lobos was equally terrific providing the music of the legend . I have no idea how much of this movie was really accurate since Hollywood takes numerous liberties when they make a movie `` based on a true story . '' I 've learned that that is very loose terminology when they say `` based on a true story or on actual events '' but in any case , it does make for a good film , though it is heartbreaking indeed . People probably think of Buddy Holly first when they hear the phrase `` The Day The Music Died '' but that plane crash also took the lives of 3 other people including The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens . Compared to other rock and roll biopics , this one rates right up there . `` La Bamba '' and `` Walk The Line '' rank pretty high as opposed to `` Great Balls Of Fire '' which was pretty dreadful . La Bamba 's supporting cast was also good . Any fan of old time rock and roll will enjoy this flick . Look also for a cameo by Brian Setzer as Eddie Cochran . It 's always fun to see real `` rock stars '' in a movie about one .	1
La Bamba is my favorite movie of all time hands down . Of all the films I have seen not many reached me the way La Bamba did . I first saw this movie back in the summer of 96 when I was 17-years old and I fell in love with this movie and also became a big fan of Ritchie Valens . No joke I would watch this movie every single day it was on . La Bamba was a staple part of HBO 's line up and even if it was on twice a day I would watch it . For me , each time I saw the movie it felt like the first time . I would drive my friends crazy with having to watch it even after I recorded the movie they figured I would n't watch it as much , but I still did.At the time I was actually learning the guitar and I never really played at all and this movie inspired me to actually practice and not only that , but it also inspired me on wanting to be a filmmaker . I really ca n't think of any other movie that reached me on this deep of a level . Like I said in the opening of my review La Bamba is hands down my favorite movie of all time . For starters it has some truly great music ; La Bamba is about having a dream and not letting anyone stop you from reaching that dream . It 's about love and family.The screenplay by Luis Valdez was excellent ; the characters are great and each of the main players all add to the movie . None of the characters are just there . Each character plays a crucial part of the movie . While yes the story does revolve around Ritchie played amazingly by Lou Diamond Phillips , but in many ways movie is actually Bob 's story played by Esai Morales who pretty much steals the show . There is a bond between the 2 brothers , but there is also tension . Bob is always in Ritchie 's shadow despite being older and I was really able to relate more to Bob in many ways than Ritchie . Ritchie was sort of the Golden Boy , while Bob was sort of the outsider.I think at some point in our lives we have felt like we were in someone 's shadow , either it be a friend , family member or co-worker . The more Ritchie finds success the more Bob falls into this despair as all the attention goes to Ritchie and he 's sort of forgotten about . The movie may revolve around Ritchie , but it 's very much Bob 's story . And Esai Morales gives a terrific performance . La Bamba is about going for your dreams and not letting anyone stop you from reaching them . We all have dreams in life and most of us are too afraid to try and make them come true . Ritchie had a dream in life and would n't let anything keep him from that and I hold that close . La Bamba gave me and still gives me the courage to go after my own filmmaking dreams.As director Luis Valdez creates some truly touching scenes and some truly inspiring moments . When making a Bio-picture normally certain parts are played up more for dramatic effect and Valdez does that here , but it works well . A lot of the scenes with tension between Bob and Ritchie comes from real life and comes from the own personal experience between Luis Valdez and his own brother . The love story between Ritchie and Donna played by Danielle von Zerneck are possibly the strongest scenes of the movie and shows a time of innocence.Prior to this movie I knew who Ritchie Valens was and I knew his music , but I would n't be able to place the music with the artist . All the music in the movie that Ritchie sings is performed by Los Lobos who did justice to the original music , but I sought out the original versions by Ritchie and loved it . On my guitar I used to play Donna , Come on Let 's Go and La Bamba non-stop . Nothing can top the opening lick in La Bamba.Lou Diamond Phillips made his screen debut , but if not mistaken he actually shot Stand and Deliver first , but this one came out first . Lou Diamond gives a performance of a lifetime . His performance is so real and inspiring . I would rate this performance as one of my all time favorites . By the time I saw La Bamba I was already a fan of Lou Diamond , but this movie made him one of my very favorite actors of all time . Esai Morales though pretty much steals the show like I stated before . Rosanna DeSoto as Connie , Ritchie 's mother is excellent and Joey Pantoliano as Ritchie 's manager is excellent , but Joey Pants always delivers . Elizabeth Pena also gives a good performance as Ritchie 's ex-girlfriend who is now with Bob , which creates some uneasy tension.I 'll be the first to admit the final act always gets me teary-eyed . The death of Ritchie and Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper was so tragic . Buddy Holly is one of my all time favorite musicians . When Ritchie 's family and friends hear the news over the radio it 's just so tragic . Sleepwalk , played by Santo & Johnny is so hauntingly beautiful and really adds to the scene ; Bob walking across a wooded bridge and stops and screams Ritchie 's name never fails to give me the chills.La Bamba is truly a great and uplifting movie that is really tragic , but again very uplifting . Ritchie was only 17-years old when he died and I remember being freaked out since I was that very age when I first saw the movie . At that age death is n't something we think about and it was quite creepy . This may be clich & eacute ; d , but Ritchie may be gone , but his music and impact will never be forgotten . His life inspired this movie and this movie inspired me.Without a doubt La Bamba is my very favorite movie nothing for me comes close . I can watch this movie everyday and never once get tired of it . Each time I see the movie it feels like the first time .	1
La Bamba is one of the movies that makes you feel good , cry and think about how life really is short . Lou Diamond Phillps was in top form as Richie Valens who never got a chance to show us what he can do . I 'm not really a rock & roll fan but this is a good movie and one hat brings every time I watch it .	1
I have loved this movie since I first watched it when I was about 16 . What a bod , what a face , what a man ! I should n't get started . I definitely fell in love with Richard Tyson from the moment I laid eyes on him . It is definitely a fantasy for women with a plot I actually enjoyed . Ever since then I have had a thing about carnivals !	1
This is a pretty erotic story with not so bad acting . I would not own it but rent it next time as once is enough	1
I am more into images on the screen than plot or acting for this type of movie . If you wish to add some beautiful images to your movie collection , this is worth the price . I am a huge fan of Sherilyn Fenn , so you know I 'm going to love this flick.If you are looking for a great plot and superior acting , you might want to skip this one .	1
I watched this movie and knew nothing about it 's director or writer . I did like this movie and also liked the plot that it offered as well . I thought that the actors delivered a very believable charactors and the story was interesting . What I did find disappointing was the information that I found on the net about the full screen verses the wide screen version . In the full screen version they edit out the `` male nudity '' of Richard Tyson but do n't edit out the `` female nudity '' of Sherilyn Fenn . I do n't have a problem with female nudity and how it is presented . What I do have a problem with is when they edit out the male nudity for no reason other than to make the screen smaller . I will recommend this movie , but purchase the widescreen to actually see this movie the way it was meant to be .	1
One of my top 5 favorite films of all time . The love , passion , storyline , and use of colors forever captivates me . I have given this movie to many people as gifts = all have enjoyed .	1
I always wanted this film and at the price of this Blu Ray it 's not to be missed . Good special features too .	1
This was a great adventure story . It is fictional but very enjoyable . The quality of the product was excellent , too .	1
Translation to screenplay is probably not the best -but- the actors Peck-Nivan-Quinn ( 1st Team ) + Quayle-Baker-Pappas , etc . ( 2nd team , ) bring it off nicely . The model work does show its age - CGI would have helped immensely . Score is superb and well recorded . Kudos to James Robertson Justice for both narration & cameo .	1
Nothing creaky about the plot despite the age of the film ; and , it is sure good to view even on a less than super new TV set . The cast is a talented crew , with Gregory Peck , particularly effective , followed closely by Anthony Quinn who had finally come into his own after many years as a supporting actor , having come early into the game ( remember him in the first Crosby-Hope film of , I believe , 1939-or 1941 ) . David Niven , while co-starred , has the weakest role to play , but does as good a job as possible . I can no longer remember details from the book on which the story is based , but there are some logical gaps in the plot which do no perceptible harm . The essential plot-line is simple , as many here have described it , but it serves well . The ferocity of domination and partisan warfare is somewhat soft-pedaled as we can tell every day by simply reading the daily papers . Just as well ; viewing would be unbearable if there was not some veneer on the harsh realities . As a footnote , I can not fail to be impressed by the actor 's voices one finds in the films made in the years through the forties ( and the stars who received formal training then and previously , s but whose careers extended into later decades . . Not a question of better of worse , but rather of style . The post-Brando player would consider it entirely artificial to use the resonance and security of tone , one had to use earlier . Nor would later movie makers have ever accepted the sound track in which every word and sound had to be articulated so as to be heard clearly in the upper balconies ( which even many `` local '' pseudo palaces possessed . ) At any rate , this is still a film which can involve you , no matter the deviations from reality it allows for dramatic purposes .	1
Gregory Peck was disappointed that more people did not perceive this movie to be anti-war , but I certainly did . This movie is well-cast , well-set and has a dramatic line which does not flag . The scenes in the Greek marketplace and at the Greek wedding are worth the price of the entire movie , especially when James Darren sings a verse of Yioula-Yioula . At times , Anthony Quinn 's performance is less believable than one might wish , and David Niven 's character can be annoying , but in the aggregate , the movie delivers , thanks to Anthony Quayle , Gregory Peck and a handful of supporting actors who more than amply support the leading actors . I have watched this film on TV for years , every time I got a chance , and I am very happy to own it !	1
Movie Made to author 's novel , Director did n't mess with perfection . All Major Actors are Pros . able to carry the story and the action .	1
One of the greatest WWII films of all time , The Guns of Navarone has witstood the test of time , keeping the viewer in constant suspense . Beyond the thrilling film itself , the DVD is a must-own because filled with fascinating extra features.It is particularly engrossing to see the numerous interviews and featurettes with the cast that were produced both in 1960/61 and today . I found it fascinating to hear the perspectives of actors while they were working on the film contrasted with a forty-year retrospective . What I actually found more interesting was probably not even intended by the producers of the DVD . By watching interviews/newsreels then and now with the fabulously talented cast ( Gregory Peck , David Niven , Anthony Quinn , etc . ) , one can not only learn more about the conditions under which the film was produced , but also witness to some extent the evolution of hollywood culture . For lovers of behind-the-scenes special features , this DVD is a must-own.However , I do agree with some of the other reveiwers complaints about the mediocre transfer to DVD . I did not think it was THAT big of an issue to hamper my enjoyment of the film , however -- only enough for me to amend my review from 5 stars to four .	1
This is a great restoration of a 60 's era WWII action thriller . I love the story of how the restorers were able to fix the color timing , in at least one sequence in the film , and reinvigorate the dialogue from the beginning sequence memorably acted by Richard Harris . The only copy locatable for a long time was one in which British censors had replaced the use of the work `` bloody '' ( apparently a terrible profanity in England ) with the word `` ruddy '' about ten times in Harris ' only scene in the film . The restoration was definitely worthwhile because this is an absorbing and exciting tale about bravery , duty , honor , redemption and forgiveness , as well as one in which lots of Nazis die violently.For the most part I liked the ensemble cast , with the strongest performances given by Anthony Quinn , Irene Pappas , and Anthony Quayle . These actors are able to convey lots of character and emotions with little dialogue and character development in the script . The rest of the cast gives good workmanlike performances , especially singer Darren as a Greek/American street tough . I wo n't ruin the plot for viewers , but I was able to figure the rat in the piece very quickly , and this should have been engineered a bit more subtly , with suspicion cast on others before it became so obvious , so quickly into the sabateur 's entrance to the film . Otherwise , this is a 60 's era WWII action film well worth two hours of your time .	1
As war movies go ; like this one pretty good . Good action scenes . Great actors . Not really a chick flick . This was the only one i ever remember seeing the traitor woman in . What 's her story ?	1
3.8 starsThe magnificent Greek island locales make this film , no question . But its 156 minutes felt far too long , and there were 30 minutes that could easily have been trimmed : lingering portrait shots , long panoramic views , etc . Those might have worked in the cinemas in 1961 , but sure seem indulgent now . And I 've rarely seen Niven overact this much ; he even sucked the normally unflappable Peck into it towards the end.Yet Peck and above all Quinn make this movie in general , along with the land and sea scapes . Quinn 's performance has the resonance and intensity lacking from Niven here , and rather shows up most of the cast with his much deeper skill set . Now that 's what acting should be.GFN is certainly meant to be an epic , but I just could n't buy it after a while . This could be a perfect two-hour movie . Instead it goes on and on at points , and what could and should be suspense fades away after a while and I just wanted them to get on with blowing everything up.I bet I would have loved this on a hot summer day in a big old movie palace , but sitting at home it all felt too self-indulgent . The script has its moments , but 50 years on it seems rather cliched at times , and of course Maclean was not exactly John LeCarre . He went for the simple emotional response , as does this movie . Which is what it evoked from me . I really enjoyed its leisurely pace for about 90 minutes , then just started wanting it to all be done.Still , Quinn is exceptional and worth seeing this for , and most of the cast is at least decent . But Niven 's hamminess and the length of it all made me realize that I was watching this not only for the first time in 30 years , but probably for the last time .	1
I had seen this movie years ago , and I really enjoyed it . I did this time too . Lots of great actors and an excellent story line . Even after all of these years , the action is very good . An excellent movie choice !	1
This one has it all -- Great story , great screenwriting , great actors , and great directing . The suspense is so never-ending that It 's difficult to start watching it and then stop before it 's over . If I go too long without watching it , I get withdrawal symptoms .	1
Guns of Navarone is best known as one of the most interesting and adventurous war movies of the CinemaScope era . The Blu-Ray the promise of an impressive film and audio transfer , the first of which was not that good when the DVD was released . Highly recommended .	1
This was a tremendous hit when first released , and it remains a rousing tale , though it 's also consistently overacted , excessively melodramatic and damned predictable . As such , it arguably belongs in the company of Where Eagles Dare and Ice Station Zebra , two other titles based on Alistair MacLean best-sellers . The story pits a team of highly skilled commandos against the German army in an attempt to disable two enormous guns guarding a narrow channel before a naval squadron tries to pass through to rescue stranded British soldiers on the fictional Greek island of Kyros during World War II . Gregory Peck plays Keith Mallory , the team leader , chosen because he speaks `` Greek like a Greek and German like a German '' and was reputed to be `` the greatest mountain-climber in the world before the war . '' That last skill comes in mighty handy , because an early part of the mission involves scaling a very high sheer cliff , which occurs just after the team survives a nasty storm at sea and a perilous - and very realistic-looking - landing on a rocky coast . The other specialists include a cynical demolitions expert ( David Niven ) , a guerrilla fighter nursing a grudge against Mallory ( Anthony Quinn ) , a burned-out expert killer ( Stanley Baker ) , a young but skilled assassin ( teen idol James Darren - who even gets to sing ) , and a pair of female Greek freedom fighters ( Irene Papas and Gia Scala ) . `` With every one of us a genius , how can we fail ? '' Mallory asks . `` You ca n't , '' his superior replies , and therein starts the tale , punctuated by titles such as `` The first day . 07.00 hours . '' The device is a bit heavy-handed , as are many other moments , but it 's really best to ignore such indulgences and instead just enjoy this as a popcorn thriller , 1960s style , with its Oscar-winning special effects , Greek locales , and a peppy , basso-profundo score by Dimitri Tiompkin.Phil 's Favorite 500 : Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime ( 2014 edition )	1
Before my time but it is a really good movie with several stars that tell a good story about WW2 .	1
The Standard & # 34 ; lets get the mission done & # 34 ; by & # 34 ; hook or crook & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; tooth and nail & # 34 ; . Gregory Peck heads this cast and is unwavering in his determination to blow up & # 34 ; The Guns & # 34 ; located in a mountain fortress . Let me say the effects and all of the & # 34 ; model work & # 34 ; that went into featuring & # 34 ; The Guns & # 34 ; is worth the price of admission . The mountain seemed inpregnatble but this ragtag team find a way in . Anthony Quinn is the stand-out in this one , he finds more in this mission than he bargined for in the form of ( Maria ) Irene Pappas . the plot is simple but the fear is real .	1
a wonderful movie starring 3 legends Rita Hayworth Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak where Frank uses Rita to get him his own nightclub but falls for Kim	1
Great entertainment from an age where quality abounded . Fabulous music performed with excellence . A prize movie for my collection . Essential viewing .	1
I was four years old when this movie was at the theaters but I distinctly remember the music being played in my home.Some people thought that this movie was dated but it holds up . The love triangle is never out of date.Stripper marries well , husband dies , meets new man below her newfound station in society . Pretty dancer in love with man who is pretty much the boy toy to the newly rich woman.My favorite songs in the movie were `` The Lady is a Tramp '' and `` I Did n't Know What Time It Was . ''	1
`` Pal Joey '' is a wonderful combination of great music andSinatra at the top of his game . The songs in the 50 's werefrequently taken from top broadway shows and performed bythe top stars of the day . This is the movie version of oneof the fine shows which spawned many records by wonderfulperformers . It is a delight to see Rita Hayworth , althoughaging , still exhibiting the dancing skills she began herprofessional career at age 14 .	1
`` Pal Joey , '' ( 1957 ) , a dramatic musical romance , is a product of Harry Cohn 's Columbia Studio , a fact easily gleaned by a quick glance at the movie itself ; while it 's in Technicolor , the colors themselves are not nearly so saturated as is the signature palette of rival Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios . The movie , as was common at the time , was based upon the 1940 Broadway hit of the same name that made a star of Gene Kelly . That play was based upon a series of fictional letters from `` Your Pal Joey , '' written by noted American writer John O'Hara , and published in `` The New Yorker . '' O'Hara wrote the play 's book ; Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart provided the all-grown up music ; George Abbott produced and directed . The still knocking them dead Elaine Stritch created that nifty song `` Zip , '' on Broadway , where it was given to `` The Reporter , '' rather than the Vera Simpson character.What was rather unusual about `` Pal Joey '' was that it took 15 years to get to the screen , owing to the fact that the play was more cynical , and risqu & eacute ; , than was permissible in Hollywood at the time . And a lot can change in 15 years . Anyway , the witty screen adaptation , somewhat sanitized , given a Hollywood happy ending , but still sailing pretty close to the wind , was by Dorothy Kingsley , nimble direction was by the under-appreciated George Sidney.But the hard-edged director Billy Wilder was said to be Cohn 's first directorial choice ; they say studio mogul and director went to lunch to discuss it - and at the end of lunch , Wilder was not only not given the job , but was given the bill . Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth had impressed Cohn by their work together in the 1944 hit , '' Covergirl , '' and the studio chief promised them another picture together , expected to be `` Pal Joey . '' But those 15 years went by , and Kelly was under contract to MGM . So Cohn thought of Jack Lemmon . Cohn initially thought of Marlene Dietrich for the Simpson role , characterized as an older woman , but Dietrich would n't take it . However , she suggested Frank Sinatra for the title role , Joey Evans . Meanwhile , Rita Hayworth , who was Columbia 's reigning sex symbol at the time , and had expected to play Linda English , the ing & eacute ; nue , aged rapidly , unfortunately . She was just 39 at filming , actually three years younger than Sinatra , but had to take the Vera Simpson , older woman part . The younger woman 's part was given to Kim Novak , the studio 's rising sex symbol . Barbara Nichols played Gladys Bump , chorus girl comic relief.Setting of the movie was moved from Chicago to San Francisco , so much more picturesque , and Novak somehow looked so good there . The movie picked up several great songs from the play : `` If They Asked Me , I Could Write a Book , '' and `` Bewitched , Bothered and `` Bewildered , '' the play 's biggest hits . Also , for sure , `` My Funny Valentine , '' and `` Zip , '' a homage to Gypsy Rose Lee . Several of the play 's songs were considered still too risqu & eacute ; , and were replaced by other works of Rodgers and Hart , `` There 's a Small Hotel , '' `` I Did n't Know What Time It was , '' and `` The Lady Is a Tramp . '' Some knowledgeable reviewers complain about the songs missing from the play ; but these replacements each became at least as popular as the tunes written for that play . Musical arrangements were by Sinatra 's frequent collaborator , Nelson Riddle . The part had to be somewhat rewritten for Sinatra , of course , emphasis changed from dancing to singing . But he sang his own songs ; he was at his peak , and the songs , as the part , might really have been tailored to him . Neither Hayworth nor Novak could sing : they were dubbed.The plot 's pretty well-known : Joey 's a womanizing nightclub singer . When he ventures beyond no-fault chorines to mayor 's daughters , he finds himself hurriedly leaving towns . He finds himself in San Francisco , where he digs up an old friend who 'll give him a job . Also ambitious chorus girl Linda English , who initially wants nothing to do with him . And Vera Simpson , retired stripper , married well , now rich older society dame . Without a word , by sheer dint of good acting , a back-story romance between Evans and Simpson is implied . Anyway , Evans becomes Simpson 's prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; e , as the movie called it ; she agrees to finance his own , ritzy nightclub . But the lovers ' triangle , Evans , Simpson , English , between the stars , creates great instability.Hayworth , wrinkles and all , is still gorgeous ; the young Novak , who would not be as much of a favorite with succeeding generations , is very beautiful . In their last scene together , so brief as to be almost subliminal , Hayworth is just haunting . Sinatra won a Golden Globe for his work ; the movie was nominated for four Oscars , and picked up four further awards . It was undoubtedly sanitized , but it 's still unusually grown-up for its time . It has many memorable , evergreen musical numbers , and three outstanding actors . They really do n't come much better .	1
It seemed after Curley left the stooges went down hill , but when Curley was part of the act the stooges where hilarious and at their best . I recomend these Curley classics , because there are no Shemp shorts in this video , I never liked Shemp .	1
Clint Eastwood , in his first film after completing his masterpiece , UNFORGIVEN , chose a winner with Wolfgang Petersen 's suspenseful IN THE LINE OF FIRE . As 30-year veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan , Eastwood had the misfortune of protecting President Kennedy , November 22 , 1963 , and the specter of not reacting quickly enough has never fully left him , through the subsequent years . At the other end of the spectrum is ex-CIA assassin Mitch Leary ( brilliantly portrayed by John Malkovich ) , who had become 'excess baggage ' for the intelligence community , due to budget cuts . After surviving a bungled attempt to kill him , Leary decides to vent his rage at his 'betrayal ' by assassinating the President . In his research , he discovers that the only agent still active from the 1963 team is Horrigan , and , deciding they shared a kinship , he begins to tease Horrigan with clues about himself , and how he 'll kill the President.The film builds up a 'head of steam ' from the very first scene , as Horrigan and his partner , Al D'Andrea ( Dylan McDermott , long before television stardom in THE PRACTICE ) take down a band of counterfeiters , and the edginess never lets up , as Leary , introducing himself as 'Booth ' , begins his series of fateful calls to Horrigan . Facing mounting opposition from the head of the Presidential Secret Service team ( Gary Cole ) , as well as the White House Chief of Staff ( future Senator Fred Dalton Thompson ) , Horrigan badgers , insults , and belittles everyone 's work , knowing the potential assassin will find any crack in the security , and take advantage of it . Only his boss , Sam Campagna ( FRAZIER star John Mahoney ) , his partner , D'Andrea , and fellow agent Lilly Raines ( Rene Russo , in another star-making performance ) , take him seriously , with Raines soon falling in love with the cantankerous agent.The plot is full of twists and turns , as Horrigan barely misses capturing Leary , twice , and Leary , at one point , actually saves Horrigan 's life ( while ending D'Andrea 's ) . Strung so tightly that he starts making bad 'calls ' , Horrigan is finally removed from Presidential security ... just as Leary is about to make his move ... IN THE LINE OF FIRE does for the Secret Service what BACKDRAFT did for firefighters , and television 's NYPD BLUE did for policemen ; it shows the organization not as a group of faceless supermen , but as dedicated people performing an essential service , protecting the lives of others . As Leary sneers to Horrigan , & quot ; I 'm the offense , you 're the defense , & quot ; and that analogue truly describes the difficulty of their job ; they must find the means to protect the President against whatever misdeed a perpetrator can concoct . While Clint Eastwood 's Horrigan may be far more of a 'lone wolf ' than the Agency would , in real life , tolerate , his dedication to his job reflects well on those unique individuals who would 'take a bullet ' for the President.It is an excellent suspense film , and a worthy addition to any Clint Eastwood collection !	1
A psycho ( played by John Malkovich ) plans to kill the President , and Clint Eastwood , an aging , almost over-the-hill secret service agent , is trying to stop him . Malkovich torments Eastwood - Eastwood was on duty protecting Kennedy when he was shot in Dallas , and he did n't react accordingly when the shots went off ; Malkovich knows it and drives him batty about it . Eastwood 's been carrying that psychological scar ever since , and now he has a chance to redeem himself.In many of Eastwood 's movies it 's hard to sympathize with him because he 's either so cruel and antagonistic or else almost unscathingly superhuman ; here he does win our sympathy because finally he IS more human and like the rest of us : he 's out of shape , he gets the flu , it takes a while to win the girl ( Rene Russo ) . It 's a nice change . There is nothing unique about the story or the way the plot unfolds : crazy man on the loose , Eastwood and cops try to track him down - though it 's done very well . The tension is maintained , yet the director ( Wolfgang Petersen ) takes time to develop the characters , especially Eastwood . Of course there 's the wow finish : Eastwood takes the bullet meant for the President ( he 's only wounded ) , thus redeeming himself . It 's a very well-done thriller ; definitely worth a watch .	1
Yesterday , for the fifth time in ten years , I saw IN THE LINE OF FIRE . And I will see it some more times again . Why ? I must admit that Clint Eastwood , since 25 years , is one of my favorite actors and directors . Who could have predicted , when Clint starred in the Leone 's movies , that he will become the institution he is now ? In this Wolfgang Petersen 's movie , he plays the role of an aged Secret Service agent who can not forget the day JFK died . Because he was there and could n't give his life in order to save his President . As for the Harry Callaghan of DIRTY HARRY , reality stopped at this very moment for him.Until the day a mad John MALKOVICH appears . From the past , it seems , because the only way to communicate with him is by phone , an antic object which creates the panic in the ranks of the superguys of the F.B.I.IN THE LINE OF FIRE is a & quot ; thick & quot ; movie you can talk about for hours with your friends . It is also an intelligent movie , which is pretty rare nowadays.A DVD zone your library .	1
The only actor i liked in this political action thriller was John Malkovitch . I mean he is one of the greatest actors alive today and this movie shows why . I loved his other movies like 'Being John Malkovitch ' , 'Con Air ' and 'Of Mice and Men ' . The tension and anger could be felt by the charecter Malkovitch played . On the other hand , this was clearly Clint Eastwood 's best preformance too . The reson why this great half and half movie did n't win an oscar is because ofa . The title.b . Based on fictional charecters and at the same time discriminating the US Government by showing lack of professionalism.c . Only three major actors.d . Release date.So anyway , some might say that this is just another action flick , which it is , so if you 'd like to see Eastwood play a hard nosed secret agent and hunt down a humerous , serial killer physcopath played by Malkovitch , then this movie will do alright . It may be a typical movie but the good thing about movies everybody would like to see is the highly awaited climax . So watch this if you are an action fan .	1
Without hesitation , this film has been one the best achieved ones of the decade ; not only because the formidable directorial accuracy ( the best film of Petersen after his masterpiece Das Boot ) ; there also other highlights such the towering performance of Eastwood as the agent who failed to protect JFK thirty years ago and the breathtaking acting of John Malkovich as the killer , the script is sharp and incisive and explores the undermined conscious filled of a strong sense of missed responsibility at the moment to avoid the inevitable murder in 1963 . So in this brilliant thriller we assist once to a cat and mouse game in which one of them will have to fail in order to redeem himself or fail again.Tense , absorbing and well made thriller .	1
This is a powerful story about Clint Eastwood as an aged secret service agent who has experienced turmoil in his life . Once a young brash man who rose to a position to protect the president , he has fallen onto hard times with the personal guilt of having seen his president assasinated . By chance he has the opportunity to redeem his life and once again defend the president . John Malkovich portrays the potent and sinister , yet very personable ex-CIA assassin who has revenge for the government that betrayed him . We are drawn through the eyes of Clint Eastwood 's character as he battles one last time to combat a strategy of this cunning opponent to perhaps , rebuild the life that was taken from him .	1
Horrigan ( Clint Eastwood ) is an FBI agent who had bungled in his duty of protecting President Kennedy , and has never forgiven himself since . He is now much older , and makes a number of false moves in trying to protect the present President . He comes across as unfit for the job and comes close to getting suspended . Life is hard for poor old Horrigan.Leary ( John Malkovich ) is an ex-FBI agent who had the misfortune of thwarting his partner 's attempt to murder him on a direct FBI order . He now holds a grudge against the FBI for this incident , and plots to kill the President.While we are aware of Leary 's methodical planning , it is still suspenseful to see if Horrigan can figure it out . The movie is thrilling to watch and is never boring .	1
This was an action-packed movie with quasi-burned-out US Secret Service Agent Clint being hounded by bad , extremely evil guy John Malkovich . There are scenes of tenderness with Clint being supported by a lady agent , Rene Russo , and there are stereo-typed jerk bosses like Clint 's supervisors and of course , the pompous Presidential Chief of Staff , played by Fred Thompson . There are many minutes of excitement and violence , building up to the final scenes in the elevator . Plus there are moments of fantasy and unforeseen circumstances where the partner is killed on the rooftops in a foot pursuit , and of course , no back-up or helicopters come into play . Near the end , even when Clint was wearing a bullet-resistant vest , a pistol shot in the chest can really slow you down bigtime - the huge bruises are ugly . But hey , it was Clint being Clint and it was a very entertaining flick..and he can run like a cheetah ... also he can play the piano quite well .	1
This is an excellent film . Clint Eastwood provides an outstanding performance in his role . I would highly recommend watching this movie .	1
This movie was wonderful ! ! ! Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep were outstanding in their roles ... truly a classic love story ! ! ! Loved it ! !	1
Clint Eastwood stars as a disgraced secret service agent named Frank Horrigan who blames himself for the assissination of John F. Kennedy . Thirty years later he is on the trail of a sociopath named Mitch Leary ( John Malkovich ) who singled out Horrigan for a game of sorts to see how close he 'll get to prevent him from killing the president.In a way this is a Dirty Harry-esque film with a few of the classic cliches , the partner being murdered and the top brass refusing to cooperate , but most importantly it 's not . Frank Horrigan is not like good ole Harry Callahan , Frank is a functioning alcoholic who has nothing going on his life other than his job . Also Clint is not afraid to show his age , he does a lot of heaving breathing when he 's running and comes down with a nasty cold standing in the rain during one of the President 's addresses . Mitch Leary and Horrigan are both alike in the sense that they are two men who have not much to live for and Mitch knows this of himself and Frank ; At one point Mitch asks Frank if he asks anything to live for and all he can muster after a brief pause is `` I can play the piano '' . Also their goals seem equally as futile , Mitch realizes he is doing little more than challenging himself for one last kill ; He really is n't going after the men whom he felt responsible for making him a `` monster '' . Frank , despite being one of principle investigators to find Leary , is totally disdant from the president . Not once do you see Frank talking to the president and you actually do n't even know his full name , he 's only seen making speeches throughout the film . The closest thing Frank gets to actually talking to the President is through the ignorant , blowhard , Chief of Staff Harry Sargent played by Fred Dalton Thompson . So this film has a healthy combo of a summer blockbuster thriller and existentialism . My only complaint is the end . I think Frank should have been killed , not by Leary but by the sharp shooters who attempt to take Leary out at the end of the film . Overall , a great film .	1
This retro review is for the special edition release of the 1993 film , '' In the Line of Fire '' .This well directed suspense/thriller by Wolfgang Peterson shows a well cast movie and all with `` game on '' .The story involves one Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan ( Eastwood ) who is a `` living legend '' , in his own tongue-in-cheek words.He is the only active and still working agent who ever lost a president on his watch ( JFK ) ; which has haunted him for years and continues to dog him with his peers.Enter one killer/psycho by the name of Mitch Leary who is hell bent on killing the president.He starngely knows Horrigan 's background and throughout the movie plays a cat and mouse game with him and the rest of the secret service.Horrigan and his staff always seem to be a step behind the killer and as close as they sometimes come , they can never quite put their hands on him.Leary slowly and methodically weaves his plan , letting no one get in the way and leaving no loose ends.For example , when he opens a phony bank account and the rep catches him in a lie about his background , he follows her home and coldly kills her because he might be able to i.d . him , and her roommate because she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.When Horrigan does finally obtain a lead in the form of fingerprints he is stone walled by none other than the CIA.Eventually it comes out to a much chagrined Horrigan , that Leary was an ex-CIA assasin who has now gone rogue.With this information the impetus to catch him steps up a few notches.All realize that Leary is VERY capable of doing exactly what he plans to do.It is during the president 's campaigning in California that the noose tightens and the Secret Service finally get their man.Horrigan saves the president 's life by taking the assasin 's bullet.Trying to escape Leary uses Horrigan as a shield and they ride an elevator several floors where the big showdown occurs.The movie ends with Horrigan and love interest , fellow agent Lilly Raines ( Rene Russo ) , sitting on the steps of the Lincoln memorial contemplating their future.This movie got Malkovich an OSCAR and Golden Globe nomination , so memorable was his performance.He played the psycho to a tee ; on the one hand very methodical and serious minded and on the other given to violent fits of rage.All this wrapped up in a character with no conscience who could kill in cold blood in an instant.Eastwood gives one his best performances on screen.For all his critics who claim he is wooden and lacking range , I invite them to see this.Eastwood embues his character with a very natural and appealing quality , but one who has been haunted deeply by his past.He pulls it off brilliantly and effortlessly.Technically the movie in this transfer is very good.The picture is quite clear and crisp in it 's widescreen format and the sound is great in Dolby 5.1 or 2.0.There is a myriad of special features which include the trailer , talent files on the films director and three main stars , shorts on `` Catching the Counterfeiters '' , '' How 'd they do That ? `` , '' The Ultimate Sacrifce : In the line of Fire '' , and an inside look at the real Secret Service.There is also a directors commentary and deleted scenes.All in all a fine release of a fine and well done film.Eastwood the films hero and Malkovich his nemesis , play their parts with equal panache and a naturalness that makes for a more believable and enjoyable movie going experience throughout ; excellent performances by both.The movie clocks in at around 127 minutes but it does n't feel that long ; one of my time worn but sure fire ways of telling me that I 'm watching something better than run of the mill.This movie is a winner all the way .	1
Frank Horrigan is a secret service agent who keeps thinking back to November 22 , 1963 , when , as a hand-picked agent by President Kennedy , he became one of the few agents to have lost a President to an assassin when Kennedy died . Now , former CIA assassin Mitch Leary is stalking the current President , who is running for re-election . Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan , and he taunts Horrigan , telling him of his plans to kill the President . Leary plans to kill the president because Leary feels betrayed by the government , Leary was removed from the CIA , and the CIA is now trying to have him killed . After talking to Leary , Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty , working with fellow secret service agent Lilly Raines . Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around , and he 's more than willing to take a bullet . White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent refuses to alter the President 's itinerary , while Horrigan 's boss , Secret Service Director Sam Campagna , is supportive of Horrigan . As the election gets closer , Horrigan begins to doubt his own abilities , especially when Horrigan 's colleague Al D'Andrea is killed by Leary . But Horrigan may be the only one who can stop Leary . `` In The Line of Fire '' delivers a great game of cat and mouse . Quite simply a well-made , well-written and wonderfully acted movie . Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner Lilly Raines . The movie 's greatness comes from John Malkovich as `` Booth '' . He captures this character 's rage and hatred , as well as his humanity . A great movie to see and peek into an assassin 's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through . I highly recommend it .	1
It 's a good road movie that is dwelling on the woman 's perspective . Janet might not be the biggest actress , but I do n't think that she is spoiling the movie . It was very interesting to see Tupac in his role . It gave him a new & quot ; role & quot ; . If you like e.g . Boyz in the Hood or Baby Boy , this movie could be interesting	1
one of the best movies in the world , it was just so real you felt like you were there , and Dennis W. Alvey needs to go back to watchin those geeky , movies he reviewed and leave the hood movies to people who know what there getting when they watch this kind of movie .	1

Hubbell was a golden boy to which everything came easy and he always took the easy road . Katie had to work at everything and therefore , she took the hard road looking for every cause to fight for . Katie and Hubbell had one class together creative writing . Katie wanted to be a journalist and she prized this class but is devastated when it 's Hubbell 's story that the professor praises . What is worse is the story is good.Both graduate and go their separate ways . Katie becomes a writer for a radio show and Hubbell enlists in the Navy . One night Katie is at a nightclub with her boss and who is there ( asleep on a barstool ) , Hubbell . Katie takes him home and thus begins their relationship .

Hubbell 's book is optioned by a studio and they are off to Hollywood.Everything is going fine . They know what lines not to cross and stay away from them . That is until communism hearing become a little too real . Katie comes to the rally of the Hollywood victims of the hearing but Hubbell wants to stay clear . This starts the end of their marriage . They know that they love each other but can not be with each other and end it amicably.Years later they meet . Both have remarried but their reunion tells you that each is the other 's true love.This is considered to be one of the great romances of all time . I definitely agree with this ! Streisand is the perfect choice for Katie ( the character in the book was inspired by her ) and Redford is the perfect choice for Hubbell . They exuded a chemistry that neither has equaled in future films.This film is well made from every aspect . The cinematography adds feeling to the scenes . The art direction and costumes evoke the eras involved . And Marvin Hamlisch 's Oscar winning score is perfection.If you ever had someone that you loved but lost , this is the perfect film . Plus according to every TV show . This is the movie you must watch after a breakup !

Melanie Griffith is one of the biggest stars in the late 80 's and early '90 's , and her stardom has faded a bit in recent years . Although I really was impressed by her early work in Working Girls , it was n't until I saw this film when I was swept away by her multi-layered performance that was funny , campy , and melodramatic . For a low-key period piece , she 's the reason to see it.Melanie plays a house wife raising 7 children under the roof of house dominated by her sexually , verbally , and physically abusive husband . She 's had enough , so she cut his off and headed for Hollywood to pursue her acting career , leaving her kids and friends behind in Alabama . She carried his dead husband 's head in a big hat box along for the ride . The police are trying to track her down.She landed a gig in a TV show and became a big star over night . It 's hard to believe that happened so easily . Everyone saw her on TV including the cops . A black boy was killed by a white boy accidently in Alabama and it was a huge racism scanddal . Melanie got arrested and was sent back to Alabama . Everyone treated her like a star when she arrived.The courtroom scene was the climatic part of the film when Melanie gets to tell her story as a victim of abuse and trying to win the simpathy of the jury . I was so moved by this scene , and Melanie commands absolute attention , because she 's very real and powerful emotionally . Whether she was released or sent to jail , you are just going to have to watch it.It was obvious that Melanie gave her all to the direction of her husband/Antonio Banderas ' debut . This is a must see for Melanie Griffith fans !	1
I enjoyed `` The Mask Of Zorro '' , it was a great adventure , with a great cast . I received `` The Mask Of Zorro '' dvd in good time , in great condition and at a good price - Thank You .	1
I loved the disney show of Zorro from the 50's/60 's . I think this movie does a good job of looking into the future of that Zorro . I think any zorro fan will love it .	1
There is nothing bad that can be said about The Mask of Zorro . When looking at it , this movie has everything : swashbuckling adventure , a plot that actually entertains as it enlightens , and a cast that works together to bring each aspect of this film to life . Antonio Banderas stars as a thief who is trained by the original Zorro , played by Anthony Hopkins . After succeeding in training Banderas , Hopkins ventures to find his stolen daughter , Elena , played by Catherine Zeta-Jones . The plot moves along on a steady path , keeping the audience tense and entertained at the same time , an unusual success for a Hollywood cinematic event . Banderas and Zeta-Jones heat up the screen as one of the chemistry-laden couples since Casablanca and Gone With The Wind . Hopkins is always a joy to watch , able to quickly change from witty and dazzling to serious and sinister . To miss this movie is like missing a daily meal , so I recommend it to all people , old and young . This DVD hosts brilliant picture quality , excellently mastered Dolby soundtracks , a theatrical trailer , making of featurette , and a photo gallery . A must for DVD fans also .	1
The first three times I saw this film ( twice within a week ; and the third a year later ) , I felt that it fulfilled its promise of being a first-rate , well-acted adventure thriller with delightfully comic overtones . The costumes and production values are also of the highest quality ; and the music with its flamenco beats is truly exciting . I enjoyed each viewing immensely.Anthony Hopkins portrays the elder Zorro with his usual elegant style ; Antonio Banderas displays his considerable talent for comedy as Zorro 's apprentice who learns ( the hard way ) to become a swashbuckling swordsman , and Catherine Zeta-Jones represents his perfect foil , in every sense of the term . She also does a smashing dance with Banderas that is both exciting and marvelous to behold.Although I still enjoyed `` Zorro '' on my recent fourth viewing , I began to notice some of the flaws that because of the general excellent quality of the film , I chose to overlook of my previous viewings , but which I finally had to acknowledge marred an otherwise romantic adventure film that could be viewed by the entire family . One , of course , is the head in the jar , which , since I know when it is about to occur , I always manage to find something to do in the kitchen until the scene is over . The other is the `` tonsil locking '' -- in the words of Alistair Cooke , former host of Masterpiece Theatre -- that passes for kissing in some films nowadays . Even in the otherwise steamy Mexican telenovelas , the hero kisses the heroine in a manner that looks both romantic and artistic , and leaves something for the audience 's imagination .	1
I love this movie . What a superb job they did on this film . Antonio and Catherine was great . The chesmtry they they had together was electrifying .	1
Great movie . I think I will order the 2nd Zorro movie even though it is not rated as high as the first . I enjoy the fact that it is multilingual .	1
I found it on TV , taped it , they left off the ending ! Buying the movie was was definitely a good idea . Sometimes we need different versions of Camulot..	1
I do n't know , but maybe some viewers were watching this movie upside down or maybe the & quot ; Gayblade & quot ; . But this movie was a real piece of work and the parts were set up just right . With some movies you ca n't expect action from the start . This was set up very well and antonio Banderas turned in a splendid performance as the new Zorro and it ended well with the classic style of the good guys winning and getting the girl . Except the movie for what it is , Entertaining . GET THIS ONE .	1
Antonio Banderas , Anthony Hopkins and the everlasting beauty Catherine Zeta-Jones were so perfect ! I was never a fan of the Zorro character , and so many friends encouraged me to watch the movie but at first I refused ... that was a mistake ! Until I saw it on cable last year , oh my God ... it is so perfect.Genuinely a challenging , thrilling and loving story ! Not to forget the touching music.Do n't make my mistake , go ahead and watch it if not buy it and you wo n't be sorry !	1
`` The Mask of Zorro '' , released in 1998 , was the first of two `` new '' Zorrro movies , the later entry being `` The Legend of Zorro '' . Not only is the `` Mask '' highly entertaining -- how could you go wrong with a cast that includes Anthony Hopkins ( who plays the 'first ' Zorro ) , Antonio Banderas ( who takes over the Zorro role and is trained by Hopkins ) , and gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones ? There is plenty of action ( some great sword fighting scenes , but being PG-13 , no profanity and minimal gore -- but the villians finally get their just due at the end ) , humor , romance , some history ( how much of the setting and events in the 1820s-1840s colonial California is acccurate is questionable -- but who cares ? This is fiction ) , beautiful sets , a decent plot , and great performances by the entire cast.The `` Superbit Deluxe Collection '' , a two-disc set , presents a stunning anamorphic widescreen transfer of this movie to DVD , with equally stellar DTS surround sound . The picture is flawless , crystal clear and free of any defects with fantastic color saturation . I could not believe this was not a high-definition DVD , the picture looked that good . Just as excellent is the DTS sound which filled the room.Superbit , a Sony technology and a forerunner of Blu Ray , has been discontinued . It 's a shame because Superbit DVDs can be played on regular DVD players . There is enhanced image resolution and sound on Superbit DVDs . I watched this DVD on my large-screen , high-definition TV , played on a Toshiba HD DVD player . You must have either a high-defintion DVD player or a high-quality DVD player than can `` upconvert '' the sound and image to see the advantage of Superbit . The Toshiba HD DVD players are quite good at this , as are the more recent Blu Ray players . There are also a number of new `` upconverting '' regular DVD players as well.I bought a used copy of this movie from Amazon at a great price . Get a Superbit version of this movie while the supply lasts . You will not be disappointed with the picture and sound quality . Highly recommended !	1
Anthony Hopkins is the real Zorro and Antonio Banderas is the young bandit he grooms to take his place and to fight against the Don responsible for the death of his wife and the taking of his daughter . Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Hopkin 's daughter who has been raised as the Don 's child.The three stars are all excellent , bringing both their dramatic capacities and a comic touch to each character . The story is engaging , with amusing dialogue and interplay between the leads . The action is well staged and punches up the story . All in all , it 's great entertainment and a well made film . I suspect Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power would have approved !	1
I go back to Tyrone Power playing Zorro so I salivated watching Banderas in color with Hopkins as his mentor . All the razzle dazzle you can ask for and a lot of fun .	1
This film is a must-see for anyone who can possibly look at a screen ! ! The casting is excellent - Elena could n't be played by anyone sexier than Catherine Zeta Jones , Diego de la Vega could n't be played by anyone with half as much attitude as Anthony Hopkins , and Alejandro/Zorro could n't be played by anyone without Antonio Banderas ' great Spanish accent and moves.Some of the excellent scenes were the dancing scene ( boy , can Zeta Jones and Banderas dance ! ) at the party , the mysterious confession scene , the sword fight between Elena and Zorro , and the scene where Diego de la Vega speaks with Elena in the stable.MUST-SEE FILM ! ! !	1
Really enjoyed this movie . Antonio Bandaras makes a great Zorrow . Anthony Hopkins remains a consumate actor . The action is marvelous and very enjoyable .	1
The Mask of Zorro brings to the screen the story of who else , but the well-known Mexican hero.The setting is California in the transitional period following Spain 's withdrawal from Mexico and Zorro , due to old age , can no longer defend the people against oppression and injustice . Subsequently , he needs to find someone to replace him or else the legend of Zorro will die with him ... The film combines romance , drama , and adventure in such a way that it spells success.Moreover , the fascinating culture and traditions of pre-union California as well as the historical time period in question are presented very well in the film.Needless to say , Anthony Hopkins , Antonio Banderas , Catherine Zeta-Jones , and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances , which are outstanding to say the least ! All the actors , without exceptions , give it their 100 % ! Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows , thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.The setting , the dialogues , the music and the costumes are all wonderful ! Very well written and very well presented , it is a movie definitely worth watching , as it will surely put you in a good mood !	1
THIS STORY HAS BEEN FILMED SEVERAL TIMES BUT THIS IS THE BEST . LIKED TYRONE POWER BUT OH THAT ANTONIO . CATHERINE-ZETA JONES TURNED IN AN EXCITING AND ACTION PACKED PERFORMANCE . NOTHING BUT GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THIS FEATURE FILM	1
This is a great movie made even better on blu-ray with a super soundtrack . Been awhile since I watched this movie and it really looked great on blu-ray .	1
I love this movie-I got it with `` THE LEGEND OF ZORRO '' follow up movie to `` THE MASK OF ZORRO '' GOOD -GOOD	1
I am happy I finally have this movie . My husband likes this movie a lot . So when I found The Legend of Zorro at Smiths I was very happy . I went home and my husband tells me I have the second movie . I was a little disappointed . It was n't till years later I found The Mask of Zorro on amazon for a good price . I bought it and finally got to watch the first movie before the second . : )	1
Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins were great ! Catherine Zeta Jones was extremely beautiful in this movie . This is one of my favorite movies and THE favorite with Banderas . I love the cute one-liners Antonio injects throughout , and Hopkins was a sensation ! Get the Superbit DTS version - AMAZING SOUND !	1
Anthony Hopkins at his extreme best , Antonio Banderas made this movie worth it ! I agree with all the people that recommend this awesome , fun movie to watch with the whole family . A highly recommendable movie to watch over and over again !	1
Zorro is back in this epic adventure film for the entire family to enjoy . Although the movie falls into the same cliches and the characters are stereotyped , it 's still worth watching . The story takes place after Zorro is already married , but his life is drastically altered when the Santanna realizes Zorro 's true identity . Now several years later , a young man 's brother is murdered by Santanna , so he now seeks revenge . With help and training from the legend himself , a new Zorro is born to rise and fight the injustice . Overall , this film may not be the best action film out there , but it 's definitely worth noticing .	1
This is an excellent compilation of the best of geniuses like Boublil & amp ; Schonberg , and ALW . The music was breathtaking , but the performers were the best of all . Elaine Paige was fabulous . Michael Ball was excellent . Ruthie Henshall was wonderful oh God I wish they had shown more of her . Colm Wilkinson was brilliant . Bernadette Peters was actually incredibly annoying , I do n't see anything in her . The same with Judi Dench ( & quot ; Send In the Clowns *shudder* ) . The best performer of the night was Lea Salonga . Her voice is nothing short of phenomenal . Her Kim & amp ; Eponine are both spectacular .	1
Wow ! ! ! It 's quite unlikely for a video of a 162 min . length to feel that you want to seemore , you really wish it wo n't end . There are lots of highlights and they are spread inthe whole video so you really wo n't get bored watching the whole thing.My favorite parts are:1 . Little Shop of Horrors ( Ellen Greene was fantastic and I love her renditions of '' Somewhere That 's Green '' and `` Suddenly Seymour '' ) 2 . Unexpected Song ( Bernadette Peters was just funny , she 's great , I especially like the beginning part priorto the `` Unexpected Song '' ) 3 . Miss Saigon montage ( I 'm a little disappointed since this is one of my favorite musicals , and I do n't thinkthat it was given enough emphasis in the video , there were 5 songs includedfrom the show but the first 4 songs were dramatically shortened , they sang about 2 lines from '' Wedding '' , about half of `` Last Night of the world '' , 1/4 of `` This is the hour '' , and 1/3 of '' The Heat is on in Saigon '' , the show deserved more than the way it was presented , butnevertheless anything with Lea Salonga is a highlight for me . But the chronology of songs weregreat starting with how kim and chris met , then got married , then the last night of theworld , then this is the hour ) 4 . Broadway Baby ( the three ladies were terrific , and it 's just a nice song tosing in this kinds of concerts , it 's especially great when a bunch of ladies occupied thestage and join singing. ) 5 . Sondheim portion ( `` You could drive a person crazy '' was just fun to watch , a lot of Lea Salonga fans said before that they wish to see her in a happy songsince they used to seeing her in tragic chracters , and well this is a good sample . Lea wasfantastic here looking all cute and pretty and funny . Another highlight would be '' You Got ta Have a Gimmick '' all three ladies were funny and great . Well of course there 's JudiDench 's version of `` Send in the Clowns '' Plus it 's fun to watch people 's reactions while theyare just on the stage watching the one performing ) 6 . Duelling Pianos ( It 's truly a joy to see two of the most accomplishedcomposers still living together . I like what they did at the tunes of '' Send in the Clowns '' and `` Music of the Night '' , you dont know if this kind of thing would happenagain so this is definitely a must watch ) 7 . Les Miserables ( well perfect to endthe concert , but just like Miss Saigon many were shortened to a great extent . Where 's '' A Little fall of Rain '' ? I especially like Lea 's version of `` On My Own '' herebetter than the Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert . Beautiful rendition . ) I highly recommend this to musical fans . Worth your money .	1
This film was the best vampire movie I ever saw in my whole life.I hate the scene at that party when the priest gets killed in front of your eyes.The master vampire makes Dracula look [ bad ] .This movie really scared me.That Hooker girl , dame she is hot but I better not tell you she becomes UNDEAD ! Jack ( James Woods ) who is the leader of a club who kills vampires.I am telling you once you have seen JOHN CARPENTER 's VAMPIRES you 'll never forget it.Even if you are undead.It is just a movie right ? Ages 13 and up can see this do to violence and bloody battles , language , adult content , and nudity .	1
This movie would have been an excellent pilot for an ongoing television series.The concept of an organized group of Vampire hunters , the hard and direct way they do their job and the no-nonsense attitude of James Woods as Jack the head killer would have translated very well to the small screen.The movie itself suffers only from the quick elimination of most of the team . It would seem very unlikely that these & quot ; professinals & quot ; would be so easily taken.All of the characters are acted well . I 've never had much use for the Baldwin brothers , but Daniel does a good job here . The biggest kudos have to go to James Woods who as always gives a performance that is so believeable that you ca n't think of the role with any other actor.John Carpenter 's Vampires is a gritty no nonsense movie that is worth your money and a great variation to a genre that could use it .	1
If you 're a guy you 'll love it ! Lots of violence ! If you 're a chick you 'll hate it !	1
i really enjoyed the movie . it was breathtakign and slowly-relax-middle east pace . beautiful hippie things , beautiful middle east , and i absolutely lved bilal , such a lveable man.the only problem i really had w it was the way it seemed to cut from one sceen near the end to another one , i feel as though maybe my movie didnt wrk right or i didnt catch something . i watched the last hr again and it makes more sense but if you miss 1 or 2 wrds at 2 key parts you 'll be lost . in sh'allah means godwilling if you didnt know , and bilal says it to lucy . : )	1
`` Hideous Kinky '' is based on an autobiographical novel by Esther Freud ( Sigmund 's great-granddaughter , not that this means anything in terms of the story ) and stars Kate Winslet as Julia , a young British woman who has traveled to Marrakech in 1972 with her two young daughters in tow , 8-year old Bea ( Bella Riza ) and 6-year old Lucy ( Carrie Mullan ) . Julia seems to be living in this exotic world because is a truth-seeker , but she is also running away from her life in London , where she caught her `` husband '' ( i.e. , the man who fathered her children ) , cheating on her . He is supposed to be sending them checks and care passages from home , but what usually happens is that the checks never arrive or are less than expected while the packages are intended for his `` other '' family.This film holds us at a distance because the perspective is not so much that of the mother as it is of the daughters . Conveniently one of them is game for being dragged around a foreign land while the other becomes rebellious . The world does seemed turned upside down when a young girl tells her hippie mother : `` I do n't need another adventure , Mom . I need to go to school . I need to learn things . '' Julia wants to understand Sufi philosophy and find inner peace . Her daughters would like to taste rice pudding again ( every time the older one has something to say the younger one announces the fact ) .It is not so much that the movie condemns Julia as it is that it fails to understand her , largely because she clearly does not understand herself . Throughout the film director Gillies MacKinnon uses familiar songs by the likes of Jefferson Airplane and Richie Havens to substitute for action and to provide the film with the appropriate vibe . If these songs are being played loudly then what Julia is doing in a strange land with her children must be a good thing because these are good songs.Yet we come to the conclusion that this what matters here in the end is not going to be a quest for enlightenment but simply the effort by Julia to get out of Morocco alive with both of her girls . However the crucial factor in this appears to be neither Julia nor the Europeans with whom she has some connections in Morocco , but Bilal ( Said Taghamoui ) , a street performer who may be running from the policy and who becomes not only Julia 's lover but a father figure of sorts to the girls . He may be a rogue , but he is a charming one and we have reason to believe that he cares about these women , even if he is ultimately powerless to help them.In the end `` Hideous Kinky '' is more about people and a place more than anything else . The performances , including Winslet 's first after the mega-success of `` Titanic , '' are certainly solid enough . But memorable moments in this film are more likely to be when a familiar song , such as America 's `` Horse With No Name , '' pops up while Julia and the girls are hitchhiking across the desert . We get a sense of the culture of Morocco , but no real understanding of it , any more than Julia really understands herself any better in the end . But what we see is captivating enough that like Julia 's children , we go along for the adventure .	1
Hideous Kinky is based on Esther Freud 's novel , told from a child 's point of view , of a strange family journey through Morocco in the early 1970s . Kate Winslett is the young mother who has left behind the stability of a flat in central London , work , and a husband . She drags her two young girls through the dusty and beautiful landscapes of Morocco , all the while searching for something she believes is out there.The theatrical trailer for this film was very odd -- all I remember about is that I wanted to see the film for some reason . Not your typical Hollywood fare by a long shot , it 's Winslett 's first major film after Titantic , I believe . Quite a departure in terms of production , however , still a very good role for her . Over time , the characters find themselves lost in more ways than one , meeting up with and losing and finding Bilal , a Moroccan man who offers a fascinating counterpoint to these atypical English travellers . The selfishness of the main character becomes more clear as we watch the children suffer through confusion , discomfort , and a suspended reality while mommy flirts with spirituality.This is not for everyone . It 's not a chick flick , it 's not exactly a travelogue ( though it approaches that format most often ) , nor is it a melodrama by any means . Taking place in the early 1970s it plays with the notions of the hippie or the pseudo-hippie , bucking the system yet stressing the notion that the system has irrevocably molded you . You may feel for the characters , or you may feel contempt at the irresponsible choices.There 's also a great soundtrack on CD . The theatrical trailer made it 's point with Jefferson Airplane 's classic Somebody to Love , while there 's also Nick Drake , Canned Heat , and some regional music from Morocco as well.The film is a real treat and is highly recommended if you want a recognizable star in a non-Hollywood setting , and if you want an insight into the nomadic handling of young children by a confused parent .	1
Though the `` Beat '' generation of the ` 50s may have been the genesis of it all , there is no doubt that the ` 60s spawned an accelerated social upheaval like nothing that came before it . It was an era that was to become synonymous with uninhibited freedom and free love , as well as a quest for change and enlightenment on a variety of levels . `` Hideous Kinky , '' directed by Gillies MacKinnon , has it 's roots in that ` 60s sensibility , but the story picks up in the early ` 70s in Marrakech , Morocco , where a twenty-five year old mother of two has come seeking not only enlightenment , but a means to effect the `` annihilation of the ego . '' Kate Winslet stars as Julia , who has left her home in London behind , as well as her children 's father , in order to pursue her quest for spiritual freedom . But , as often happens when reality sets in , that quest becomes something of a trial in itself , as life becomes a matter of living hand to mouth , depending upon the generosity of others -- in many cases strangers -- and unfortunately at times putting not only Julia , but her two young daughters in peril for their lives . As a friend tells her early on in the film , in response to her reaction to the brutality to which he is subjected at work , `` This is n't London -- '' And had she been a bit more astute , those simple words from her friend would 've been all the enlightenment she needed . But to one with an eye on the prize and an adamant attitude , such simple wisdom is rarely perceptible , and -- as in Julia 's case -- more often than not will go unheeded , as it does here . There 's beauty in much of what Julia encounters on her journey , but mostly it 's something of a travelogue for places to avoid at any cost ; and the film is disconcerting in that the audience -- as an impartial observer -- can readily discern the futility of Julia 's endeavors , and the fact that her children are subjected to it , as well , is unnerving at times . Of course , hindsight is always the nectar of the gods , and it 's easy to see the `` big picture '' when you 're able to view it at arm 's length . There is no question that her quest is admirable , but because this is a person you come to like early on -- her personal qualities and motivations are beyond reproach ; it 's her decisions that are questionable -- it is frustrating to watch her muddle her way through ( even during the happier moments ) when it all seems so unnecessary , somehow . What is required , perhaps , is a thorough understanding of the times , and the attitudes effectuated by them ; for the allurement of an awareness that can effect spiritual release is compelling , and the wisdom thought to be afforded by the fool on the hill can be an irresistible enticement even today . You have to admire Winslet for taking on a fairly unglamorous , though somewhat sympathetic role , after her mainstream success in `` Titanic . '' With what I 'm sure must have been a plethora of plum parts from which to choose , rather than play it safe she took the daring route and determined upon a project with character and substance . And though Julia may not be her most memorable creation , there is no question that her performance here is the highlight of the film . She lends an earthy , endearing quality to the character that make her not only likable , but believable ; and because you sense the danger of her situation , it evokes a feeling of uneasiness that can not be dispelled . It also makes you empathize with those whose loved ones embarked upon journeys similar to Julia 's during this era ; and there were many . The supporting cast includes Said Taghmaoui ( Bilal ) , Bella Riza ( Bea ) , Carrie Mullan ( Lucy ) , Pierre Clementi ( Santoni ) , Abigail Cruttenden ( Charlotte ) , Ahmed Bouland ( Ben Said ) , Sira Stampe ( Eva ) and Amidou ( Sufi Sheikh ) . A film that prompts emotional involvement on a number of levels , `` Hideous Kinky '' is a paean of sorts to those who seek the fulfillment of a better way of life , and are willing to take the road less traveled to find it . And the strength of Winslet 's performance alone makes it a film worth seeing . In her previous outing , she may have had a beautiful blue jewel to wear around her neck , but in this one , she `` is '' the jewel . And , make no mistake , it 's the magic of the movie .	1
Off-beat , original , and a masterpiece . That is Hideous Kinky in a nutshell . Kate Winslett was once an actress I held in contempt for that horrid movie Titanic . Since then , however , she has redeemed herself . Playing most notably , Ophelia in Branagh 's Hamlet , and the delightfully sinful cousin in the adaptation of Thomas Hardy 's novel Jude . This movie is no exception . Here she plays an English expatriate living in Moracco . She has taken her two small children and the three of them live in poverty waiting on the next check from the children 's careless father , who is a poet in England . As Winslett continues her neverending seach for inner enlightenment and her obsession with the sufi , she becomes as neglectful to the children as their father is . It is a tale about a woman who desires freedom , but is torn by responsibility.Supporting Winslet is an excellent cast of unknows . Playing her love interest , Bilal , is Sad Taghmaoui , who handles his role excellently . Perhaps most impressive are the two little girls . Older Bea , who just wants to be normal , is played by Bella Riza . Carrie Mullan is younger Lucy , who is still trying to understand what her wild life means.Director Gillies MacKinnon does a wonderful job of portraying the foreign landscape and capturing the overall feel of Moracco . Based on the novel by Esther Freud ( yes , she is in the direct lineage of old Siggy ) this movie is not a typical flick , which is what makes it so nice . A refreshing break from the run-of-the-mill Hollywood movie , this may be the best movie the world never saw .	1
Great movie . A key movie in the 90 's Godzilla seris . But why is n't it on DVD ?	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie . I like the classic monsters with combination of Mechagodzilla.I like the feel of the picture .	1
This is a great entry in the long running ( and apparently endless ) Godzilla series . Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla II brings back a couple of fan favorites for another showdown in Tokyo . Yes , this is a sequel , but not to the Showa entry `` Terror of Mechagodzilla '' that came out in 1975 . `` MechaGodzilla II '' actually follows up on events that occurred in `` Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah '' and `` Godzilla vs. Mothra : Battle for the Earth '' . Using the robotic head of Mecha King Ghidorah , scientists craft the ultimate weapon to battle Godzilla ... MechaGodzilla.MechaGodzilla looks awesome here ! I think I prefer his look in this film over his later appearances in the Millenium series films . Also ruining Japan 's day is a nifty appearance by Rodan , the giant flying pteranodon we have n't seen in action since `` Destory all Monsters '' . Rodan is found hatched from an egg on a remote island , where another egg remains intact and covered by a strange plant.There are some great fight scenes here , and I have to say , some of the punishment dished out Godzilla 's way actually made me wince a few times ! The special effects are top notch , as is the original score by Toho/Godzilla legendary composer Akira Ifukube . If you are only familiar with the 1960's/1970 's Godzilla films , I highly recommend these 1990 's productions .	1
This Godzilla film from the early nineties is an excellent movie and shows what such a film the 98 turd could have been if toho had made it . The number 2 in the title is not indicitave of a sequel as this film stands on its own . The inclusion of & # 34 ; baby godzilla & # 34 ; almost put me off purchasing this . Really glad that it was not manilla but new take on creature . As with any Godzilla film would only recommend watching in japanese ( with subtitles for those who dont know japanese ) . Amazon did provide free english dub version on kindle with purchase of dvd- that one gets 3 stars . Not bad as far as dubs go but only if one has time to waste . The movie was well paced and was definitly a good purchase .	1
This one ranks in the top 3 Godzilla movies . G is in most of it , he adopts a baby , Rodan joins in the fun . Nonstop action . Great job all around . A must have !	1
Maybe one of the best ones out there . Great action and story with heart , I have to say Baby Godzilla was so cute that I want one LOL . I do n't think any fan will be disappointed . The voice dubbing was good and the film transfer great .	1
This is the quintessential Beethoven movie of our time . A story of a musical genius . Get it and enjoy the story and the music .	1
One longs for a movie that treats a great artist 's life as something other than the ravings of a madman.While the wait carries on , however , IMMORTAL BELOVED is delicious entertainment . The mysterious woman of Ludwig von Beethoven 's scrawled final testament turns out to be his sister-in-law , the widow of a brother killed by consumption , and -- in the end -- the mother of the nephew Beethoven snatched from her . The boy himself was an unfortunate soul who in the end turns out to have been flesh of Ludwig 's flesh.If this sounds a bit like supermarket tabloid stuff , well , the difference lies in that Ludwig von Beethoven was no momentary celebrity whose life will flare out after its requisite fifteen minutes of fame . On the contrary , Beethoven was one of the West 's and indeed humanity 's great artistic geniuses . A conspiracy tale wraps so much more satisfyingly around a life like his . This is especially so when the story is accompanied by the man 's own music , played with ominous solemnity the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir George Solti 's baton.I somehow missed this film when it was released in 1994 . Other things were going on . A Memorial Day weekend spent with the DVD is a pleasure that more than requites the wait . Jeroen Krabb & eacute ; 's performance as Friend-of-Ludwig Anton Schindler deserves at least the merit that Gary Oldman as Beethoven and Isabella Rosselini earned for their arguably lesser performances.Krabb & eacute ; becomes the film 's dramatic center as he vollies between historical personages in an attempt to piece together the contours of Beethoven 's loves . His stolid weightiness makes him perfect for such an anchoring role.The filming ( Chekoslovakia ) is gorgeous and there is , always , the music.IMMORTAL BELOVED turns Beethoven 's life and death into a tragedy . Although the historicity that makes this artistic decision plausible is debatable , it is arguable that only a man well acquainted with the tragic could have written such enduring , powerful , seductive music.Vielleicht , dann , es mu & szlig ; te sein .	1
I love this movie . Gary Oldman shines as Ludwig Von Beethoven . This story has romance , drama , mystery , and a great score !	1
I truly enjoyed it . The music is great and if you like classical music you 'll love it . Every Gary Oldman movie I 've seen I enjoyed . Even though the story is fictional it keeps you interested throughout . I truly recommend it .	1
Despite whatever anyone says about the rest of the movie , the almost-final scene featuring the & quot ; Ode to Joy & quot ; is the best expression of the transcendent passion of creativity ever produced on film . The video is worth buying for that scene alone . Gary Oldman is great , the story is fascinating -- although no one actually believes it to be historical , it 's still a fascinating account of the personality of a genius .	1
This is a great 'male bonding ' film . You know tough guys , bare knuckles , gambling New Orleans style , winner take all . That kind of stuff ! Add to that Charles Bronson , James Coburn and Strother Martin and you 've got a hit on your hands . A hit , get it ? Set during the Depression Era in the 30 's , Chaney ( Bronson ) drifts into town on a southbound freight train . Broke and hungry he immediately begins to look for a way to make some money doing what he does best , fight . Quickly proving himself to be a formidable foe he hires a local down-on-his-luck gambler and promoter named 'Speed ' ( Coburn ) to set-up his fights . Poe ( Martin ) is also hired on as Chaney 's `` cut-man '' and the three are off to make some fast money.As Chaney 's reputation grows an eventual showdown looms on the horizon with the toughest , dirtiest fighter in town , Jim Henry ( Robert Tessier ) . The big money is within reach if Chaney is really as good as he thinks.Great performances by all . Bronson and Coburn are magic together and Strother Martin is , as always , the consumate character actor . As for Robert Tessier , well they just do n't get any meaner then him . Truly one of the great bad guys of film ! So gentleman send the ladies out for the evening , put the beer on ice , order the pizza and invite a couple of buddies over . Just do n't get carried away and try to duplicate anything you see on the screen .	1
Walter Hill 's 1975 directorial debut `` Hard Times '' is about as predictable as a `` Lone Ranger '' radio serial . It 's also one of the most esthetically perfect action films you are ever going to see . I 'm not sure if there is a single original idea or thought in this Depression era bare-knuckled boxing tale , but it is blessed with a style and verve that raises its level of respectability several notches.The New Orleans ' locale is magnificently used , with detours to Cajun cookouts , strolls through Louisiana graveyards and conversations on French Quarter balconies adding memorable spice to the dramatic gumbo . The trio of stars , Charles Bronson , James Coburn and Strother Martin , a bit past their prime , but as comfortable as a worn leather jacket , are perfectly suited as men scarred by the hard knocks of life.Bronson especially , is given one of the finest roles of his twilight career . He 's a man of few words , riding the rails looking to make a buck in bare knuckle fighting . We never really know his past , with his screen persona filling in the gaps . That 's a fault . And yet like a ghost , he silently moves in and out of the shadows of New Orleans creating a fiercely independent character we would want on our side . Coburn , as usual , is terrific as the conman who bankrolls Bronson . He 's a fast talker , eventually too fast for his own good . Martin , one of the finest character actors in history , is nothing short of brilliant as the cut man struggling with the dark addictions of life . These three characters are going nowhere , but for a brief moment as a team , they buck a corrupt and brutal system.The fight scenes themselves are nicely choreographed , but what one remembers from `` Hard Times '' are the quieter moments - Bronson having a cup of coffee in a diner with Jill Ireland , Coburn smoking a cigarette in bed with a prostitute , Martin sitting in a church listening to gospel singers . These characters are weary and tired , and the Depression has left them hopeless and forgotten.There is really no surprise as to this film 's ending . Yet in many ways it is poetically perfect as Bronson , having saved the day , disappears back into the shadows never to return . This is a street legend as old as the hills . We watch the recent film `` Sea Biscuit '' and roll our eyes at its excess . We watch `` Hard Times '' and understand this tale at heart , is a simple yet inspirational one . Rarely has the legend been more perfectly executed on film .	1
What can I say ? It 's Charles Bronson in one of his all time best roles with a supporting cast that includes , Stuther Martin ( An all time great character acter who is greatly missed . ) as well as the late great James Coburn.Bronson was playing the hard hitting , strong and silent type anti hero long before Eastwood ever thought about it . He set the standard and it shows in this film.The fight scenes are some of the best I have ever seen , the costums , dialog settings and acting are all superlative.If you do n't have this film in your library , shame on you.Buy it !	1
Charles Bronson plays Chaney , a street-smart , aging bare-knuckle boxer , who arrives in town as a hobo on a train . He has little money , great brawn and grit - and enough wisdom to observe and learn with little reason for small talk . While having coffee at a downtown diner , he notices activity in a nearby building . Watching a no-holds barred street-fight , he realizes he can win and make some easy money . James Coburn plays Speed , the two-bit promoter who books Chaney in street fights in small towns . Chaney has a soft side , trying to find love and adopting a stray cat , with scenes showing he cares for it . He is briefly involved in a love affair with the lovely Lucy , Jill Ireland - Bronson 's real-life wife . This goes nowhere , Lucy wants stability , but Speed is strong and knows one gets hurt in life by showing feelings and forming relationships , even with a cat . So , it is back to a final gut-wrenching fight to show if Chaney is really as good as he thinks.Even though this film is focused on male prowess and survival , it pulls its weight as a great drama and has fantastic performances by all . The movie keeps a steady strong pace , and Bronson and Coburn play on each other with great synergy meant for these rolls . Strother Martin , as Poe , is perfect sidekick and doctor of sorts . Robert Tessier , plays a great role as the toughest fighter that Bronson floors . He has tattoos and bald head with perfect face for fighter and grit of expressions.A film nor of sorts , with beautiful scenes of New Orleans and music to frame appropriate scenes . The movie is a history of how prize fighting started and what it takes to be a man in hard times .	1
My mother loves this movie , however only had the movie on VHS . It was time to go with DVD . She enjoyed this more clear version and will always consider this one of Charles Bronson 's best .	1
Although one would have to have totally invulnerable knuckles and hand bones to do these fights in real life ( as a doorman in the 70s I broke them three times hitting skullbone ) , this is Bronsons best , lean dialogue , `` just the money '' .	1
I 've seen this film about 17 times and I never tire of it . It 's not only classic gritty 70 's cinema , but it 's probably Bronson 's best movie as lead actor . Well directed by Walter Hill , who also directed classics like The Warriors and 48 hours . Hill brings the depression and New Orleans in the 30 's to vivid life . The acting is spot-on , and personally I think this is Bronson 's best performance , as well we have James Coburn who hams it up to classic measure . Struther Martin is simply perfect in his role as Poe as well . There is a lot of superbly crafted fist fighting scenes that are some of the very best I can remember ever seeing , and the film is just plain classic 70 's cinema , laying somewhere between B film and Big budget 70 's movies . This movie is one of those little miracles that comes along once in a long time . Bronson was just great in this as a bare knuckle boxer who seems tough as nails and merciless , but who really has a heart of gold . By the end of the film there 's a beautiful message about the bonds of friendship that we can all learn a lesson from . So I 've seen it many times and the film still captivates me every time I see it . It 's classic Bronson and well worth seeing ! ! !	1
I can only echo what so many have already said , this is by far Bronson 's best . I just want to give a nod to the fine supporting performances that help to elevate this film to the status of B-movie classic . Robert Terrier , always the tough guy , fits the role of `` the one to beat '' to a tee . ( Terrier was actually a decorated Korean war vet who was also an accomplished furinture maker . ) And while James Coburn does a fine turn as the slick fight promoter , it is Stother Martin who steals the show as Bronson 's corner man , Poe . No one could have delivered the line , `` In my third year of medical school a dark cloud appeared over campus and I left under it , '' quite like Martin.THe directing is outstanding as well . The fight scenes are handled brilliantly . A first rate guilty pleasure !	1
`` Hard Times '' was Walter Hill 's 1975 directorial debut . He also wrote the screenplay . His preferred ( more accurate and better ) title was `` The Streetfighter , '' as it was/is known in Europe . Hill went on to do more popular films like `` The Warriors '' ( 1979 ) and `` The Long Riders '' ( 1980 ) . The reason I was interested in checking out `` Hard Times '' is because it had garnered a bit of a cult reputation over the years ( although not as cult-ish as `` The Warriors '' ) .THE PLOT : Charles Bronson plays a poor drifter/loner , Chaney , during the Depression who travels by boxcar to New Orleans . He spies an illegal bare-knuckle fight in a warehouse and offers his fighting talents to a fast-talking gambler , Speed ( James Coburn ) . Chaney proves himself a formidable and profitable fighter , but Speed ca n't hold on to money because of his gambling addiction and is in constant trouble with the mob.One thing that 's amazing is that Bronson was 53 freakin ' years-old when the film was made , yet physically looks better than most guys half that age . Bronson 's beautiful wife , Jill Ireland , plays his love interest ( as usual ) and was 39 years old at the time.Although very little is revealed in the film about Chaney 's past ( we know he had experience as a coal miner ) , it becomes fairly certain that he had a lot of experience with bare knuckle fighting . We know this because he is supremely confident of his skills despite his age . Chaney is not big or ultra-muscular , but he 's fearless , calmly self-controlled , does n't bleed easy and expertly knows how to READ other fighters . Chaney 's weakness is that he 's a loner and does n't talk much , hence he NEEDS Speed to do the talkin ' for him and set up matches in order to make money from his uncommon skills.I first saw `` Hard Times '' two years ago and thought it was decent , but I did n't quite get the 'great cult film ' hoopla . Perhaps I was n't prepared for the ugly/dirty Depression era sets and New Orleans locations ; or maybe I just was n't in the mood for a fight film . I just saw it again , however , and appreciate it more . `` Hard Times '' has numerous memorable scenes , lines and characters . I was entertained throughout its 90 minute runtime -- grinning , frequently busting out laughing and even clapping ( huh ? ) . Speaking of the runtime , I love it when pictures are n't needlessly overlong.Here 's one sample of some of the great dialogue : Chaney 's date asks him what he does for a living . Chaney simply responds that he makes money by knocking people down . She mockingly asks , `` What does it feel like to knock somebody down ? '' He brilliantly replies , `` It makes me feel a hell of a lot better than it does him . `` Although Chaney is depicted as a likable , honorable , bold and compassionate person , his downfall is that he is unable to make long-term commitments , preferring to be `` free '' and mysterious . [ SPOILER ALERT ! -- THE REMAINDER OF THIS PARAGRAPH AND THE NEXT TWO ] Because of this flaw he ultimately loses his beautiful girl to someone else . He then leaves New Orleans as mysteriously as he came , albeit now a streetfighting legend and carrying a lot of cash.The ending leaves many questions to ponder : What prompts Chaney to change his mind and try to save Speed by taking on an expert fighter from Chicago ? Did n't Speed dig his own pit ? Chaney himself angrily told Speed that he did n't owe him anything . Perhaps , as Chaney laid on his bed under the ceiling fan in his dump of an apartment , he realized that maybe he DID owe Speed for granting him the opportunity to utilize his talents and make money . In other words , without Speed he would n't have had his success . Perhaps he decided he wanted to make even MORE money in one final fight before leaving New Orleans . Possibly , it dawned on him that , although Speed is certainly to blame for his own problems , Chaney realized that he had fallen into his OWN-dug pits in the past and needed someone to help him get out . Or maybe he realized that , in all the world , he had less friends than can be counted on three fingers and felt it was his duty to help Speed ( and Poe ) out.Regardless of his reasons , the ending expertly shows Chaney 's loyal and generous character . He may be a man of few words , but he certainly CARED about those connected to him , even if they were severely flawed addicts and con-artists . Heck , he even LOVED his cat ! [ END SPOILER ALERT ] FINAL WORD : `` Hard Times '' is worthy of its cult film status . Enjoy .	1
If you know and love this movie , you should get this Collector 's Edition asap : the extras are fabulous , and the special `` High Definition '' presentation with `` pink frilly edges '' looks just as gloriously bad as it does on any other DVD released so far . For a movie set in Middles Ages and shot in the 1970s , it 's better than what you might expect . The packaging is really shoddy , with a famous glue strip that tried to break the extras DVD when I attempted to remove it from the box . Once I accomplished the extraction , I struggled for a long while , trying to figure out how to place the second DVD back in the cumbersome box of not-quite-so-sturdy construction , which basically fell apart after opening . However , is it not in the spirit of Monty Python , to have this opus magnum housed in a box whose condition mimics this of the cheap collapsing Camelot model in the film ? I placed the second DVD in an empty plastic box and proceeded to discover the wonders of this deranged collection- which is great beyond words.For starters , there is The Senitype , `` a single 33-milimeter frame from the original motion picture negative '' , which comes framed in a cardboard file describing how to start collecting the yearly editions of the frame and warns you that while it is not a laxative ... . well , you need to get the box to find out the rest.The print edition of the script , the singalongs , the documentaries , the subtitles for People Who Do n't Like the Film , the Japanese version of the movie and the Lego Block version of the Camelot Scene ( my favourite ! ) .. It will take you a couple of hours , at least , to go through the whole magnificent lot.This is one collector 's edition which lives up to its title , and it does it to the optional soundtrack in `` glorious old-fashion mono '' , and animated menus with `` very loud surround sound . '' Highly recommended .	1
Well , Monty Python 's Holy Grail is a gem in and of itself , but this edition has quite a bit of added pleasures ( as you probably could surmise from the title ) . It has an intro that I had n't seen before - I thought I 'd stuck in the wrong video , which I quickly discovered was its intent . There were added scenes in the movie , which I enjoyed.All around , it 's a must for those who adore these guys as much as I do .	1
True comedy at its best . Good pacing , excellent acting . Classic lines . This is real comedy ! Not like the carp that passes for humor in movies today .	1
This movie is the craziest thing I have ever seen in my life and I absolutly LOVED it ! Knights , monsters and unladen swallows what else can you ask for ? Mind you this movie is for only those who have a weird sence of humor and not for anybody who is looking for a historical documentary of King Arthur . If the movie is in the comedy section of Blockbuster I 'm guessing that is n't HISTORICLY ACCURATE ! ! !	1
Monty Python and the Holy Grail broke new comedic ground in the 1970 's . IMDB provides plot information and I wo n't reproduce that here . This has the entire original Monty Python company ( a lot of them are gone ) . All are excellent . The plot is quite funny , and the sight gags are about as good as it gets.An incredible amount of contemporary humor comes from this classic . A must see .	1
This movie is just hilarious . I do n't know how else to put it . It 's basically a series of short sketches that have to do with the legend of King Arthur . He blunders his way about the land gathering 'knights ' on his way and leading them on a search for the Holy Grail . Along the way , he has some hilarious encounters.One of the funniest aspects of this movie is the dialogue . Some of the scenes are incredibly funny . The burning of the witch ( she turned me into a newt ! ) and Dennis the peasant ( you ca n't expect to wield supreme executive power just cause some watery taut threw a sword at you ! ) are among the most memorable . Equally funny is Arthur 's battle with the black knight and Sir Robyn 's encounter with the giant ( when danger reared it 's ugly head , he boldly turned his tail and fled ) .The special features in this set are fabulous . What could be more funny than Monty Python in legos ! Just the bonus disc is enough to entertain someone for hours.Monty Python is undoubtedly one of the most talented comedy troupes ever to perform , and this is the creme of the python 's crop . If Monty Python is n't funny , I do n't know what is .	1
My eldest brother introduced me to the world of Monty Python last year , and of course I found it amazingly , brilliantly funny ! He recently bought me the full box set of all Monty Python movies , and in my opinion , `` The Holy Grail , '' is the funniest Monty Python ever ... Everything is well thought out and executed in true Python style . From the coconuts and the swallows to the witch burnings and killer bunny , this movie has it all : absurdity , humour , erm ... tragedy ? Ok not that really , but anyway . The storyline is simplistic but of course there are massive deviations from the actual story thanks to the British Police and various French K-nighits that constantly impede King Arthur 's noble quest to find the Holy Grail . The whole Python group deliver a dynamite performance filled with fall-over-laughing skits and absurd situations , whether it 's the difficulty of building a castle in a swamp or using a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the French Fortress.The extras on the DVD include old movie posters and drawings for Nostalgic fans , an extra short on the use of coconuts ( which I found incredibly useful for training swallows ) , Various sing-a-longs icluding a Lego Knight Version of the `` Camelot '' song and trailers from various films . All in all , this DVD has the most extra material on it for Python fans , so much so that it 's on a whole other DVD . That 's right , 2 DVDs ! What more could you ask for ? If you love political and social satire , any Monty Python will have you laughing your head off . But if you like it in a Medieval setting , then `` Monty Python and the Holy Grail , '' will be your cup of tea delivered by a European Swallow ( African Swallows are larger but are non-migratory ) . Anyway , this movie kicks buttocks ! 10/10 for the world 's silliest men around !	1
From the opening credits to the final crane shot , you 'll be in stitches.It 's hysterical at a level that any 12 year old can enjoy , but at the same time it 's a sophisticated , post-modern romp through history that any adult with a funny bone can enjoy.This movie is silly , irreverent , illogical , ahistorical , hysterical , naughty , and utterly charming.Monty Python is a comedy genius ! ! ! ! !	1
In 1974 the bad boys of British comedy decided to create a full-length motion picture , which was destined for greatness ( or at least mediocrity disguised as greatness ) .Monty Python and the Holy Grailis a totally distasteful classic of almost epic proportions.The film stars John Cleese , Graham Chapman , Eric Idle , Michael Palin , Terry Jones , and Terry Gilliam , who not only acts but also serves as the film 's co-director and animator . Each member ofMonty Pythonis perfect in their ( dis ) respective roles , but standing out from the others is the late Graham Chapman , who plays King Arthur as the `` straight character '' . Chapman portrays Arthur as a serious , heroic figure who is completely unaware of his self-satirizing surroundings.Monty Python and the Holy Grailbegins with a series of gags involving mock-Swedish subtitles and of all things , moose and llamas . After some of the strangest credits ever , the first scene opens on an epic shot of the mist-shrouded moors of medieval Britain . Two men come galloping heroically into view . What 's odd is that neither of them are on horses . In fact , one of them is simply banging two halves of a coconut shell together to simulate the sound of hoof beats . Thus hilarity ensues . The story also includes such memorable characters as an obnoxious French `` taunter '' , a three-headed knight , an effeminate prince who just wants to sing , a ghastly cartoon monster , and perhaps the most lethal rabbit ever put on film.What makes the film so bloody funny is the complete lack of respect that it shows to Arthurian legend and medieval folklore . Both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones ( the dementedly brilliant directors and co-stars ) are quite familiar with medieval history and delight in lampooning it at every turn . The dialogue is perfectly ridiculous and that 's precisely what makes it so entertaining.I wo n't go into great detail about the plot ( ha-ha-ha ! ) or the innumerous zany characters other than to say it 's absolutely irreverent and mad ( something that seems common with the Pythons ) . Even the ending of the film is intentionally anti-climactic.But if you want British comedy without restraint , then check out this classic or , `` I 'll wave my private parts at your aunties , you cheesy lot of secondhand , electric-donkey bottom biters ! `` Oh , and do n't forget your coconuts.The 2-disc Special Edition includes the following special features : an audio commentary by directors and stars Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones , an audio commentary by John Cleese , Eric Idle , and Michael Palin , Follow the Killer Rabbit feature , Subtitles for People Who Do n't Like the Film ( taken from Shakespeare 's Henry IV , Part II ) , On-Screen Screenplay , three Sing-Alongs , The Quest for the Holy Grail documentary , BBC Film Night : On Location with Monty Python and the Holy Grail vintage featurette , two scenes from the Japanese language version of the film , How to Use Your Coconuts instructional featurette , Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego short film , extensive image galleries , An Interactive Cast Directory , and theatrical trailers.Also recommended : The Pythons : Autobiographyby The PythonsThe Complete Monty Python 's Flying Circus : 16 Ton MegasetAnd Now for Something Completely DifferentJabberwockyMonty Python 's Life of BrianMonty Python 's The Meaning of LifeThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen	1
It is well-known that the Pythons themselves believe & quot ; Life of Brian & quot ; is their best movie . In terms of production value , it probably is , but it 's not nearly as funny as & quot ; Monty Python and the Holy Grail. & quot ; Made on a shoestring budget and played absolutely straight by the troupe , it is hilarious and intellegent at the same time , as well as being charmingly rustic ( due to the low budget ) .The late Graham Chapman plays Arthur , and is perfect in the role . He is always dignified and noble , even while taking insults from ludicrously-accented Frenchmen . All the other Pythons have multiple speaking parts - a special highlight for me is Terry Jones as the whining prince . The Pythons are at their pseudo-intellectual best in this , their first feature film . My favourite part is Arthur 's argument with the peasants making up the anarcho-syndicalist commune ( & quot ; You ca n't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you ! & quot ; ) , followed closely by the opening scene of the film , where it 's revealed that Arthur is not riding a horse but has a servant following him making horse-noises with a coconut ( & quot ; Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate ? & quot ; ) .The DVD is packed with nifty extras . There are two making-of features , one made while the film was in production ( by the BBC ) the other made just recently . The latter features Terry Jones and Michael Palin travelling through the country reminiscing and visiting the old locations ( do n't worry - it 's better than it sounds ! ) . Most importantly , the DVD looks fantastic , and the sound is good as well , and if you 're still trying to figure out what the characters are saying , you have several subtitle-caption options . There are numerous other extras , including a version of the song & quot ; Knights of the Round Table & quot ; with animated Lego figures - hilarious ! For Monty Python fans , this DVD is an absolute must , and I recommend it most highly to everyone else !	1
... Even they 'll wake up with laughter . The loony boys from Britain were enjoying their peak of success after this movie was released in the U.S.Some wo n't get it . Some will think its morbid . Some will go out and buy a shrubery . I still find myself shouting & quot ; Ni ! & quot ; uncontrolably from time to time . I 'm sure this will pass .	1
John wrote-I 'd rather be shot in the face with projectile diarrhea then watch any parts of this movie again . As you can see I 've bashed this movie pretty good and although it is well deserved , I think it 's pretty safe to say I 'll be hit with a lot of non-helpful votes . Good day to you all. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Well John , I 'm certain that if you are shot in the face with projectile diarrhea that the person who does it will be meet with a round of applause . Also I suspect that the diarrhea will improve your appearance . Good day to you as well ! !	1
It does not get any better than this ! If you want to see MPFC Masterpiece , then here you go ! I just love to watch this when my Born Again relatives come lurking around . If you are a Christian having a sense of humor and a semi open mind you should enjoy it.I feel that this film will be watched , banned , burned , condemned and laughed at a 100 years from now . So relax and be happy ! And look on the bright side of life !	1
This is still to this day one of the finest , funniest movies ever made . Im so happy they have it on pretty much any format . Monty Python has a youtube channel now too . Great stuff .	1
The very mention of this comedic masterpiece should be enough to bring a smile to your face . Widely regarded as the very peak of sketch comedy troupe Monty Python 's career , The Holy Grail has nearly become as much of a religious establishment as the dark-aged deities it spoofs . There exist lunatics around the world who are able to not only directly quote lines from this film , but to recite the entirety of the script , from start to finish , without err . And , after just a single viewing , it 's easy to find yourself tempted to join their ranks.The story is simple enough , and yet manages to become intertwined and entangled within itself throughout the course of the brisk 89 minute run time . King Arthur , best known for his acquisition of the sword in the stone and subsequent leadership of the knights of the round table , is featured here as a blunt , modest man ... oblivious to everything going on around him , and painstakingly patient through the most bizarre of circumstances . As the story unfolds , Arthur slowly gathers his knights , briefly visits Camelot and is charged by god to retrieve the infamous Holy Grail . The troupe embarks directly on their quest , without the slightest idea of where they 're headed , and eventually runs into dozens of almost unrelated hurdles along the way.In print , the premise sounds painfully unfunny ... almost a joke unto itself . And , perhaps if they 'd stuck to their guns about the whole & quot ; knights in shining armor & quot ; thing , that early judgment may have been partially right . But a great deal of what makes this so fun to watch is the way the characters interact with one another , address their environments and simply carry themselves . The Knights of the Round Table chat amongst each other in a very modern , almost twentieth century style . Formalities are few and far between , and supporting characters whose entire role in any other period piece would have been limited to & quot ; Yes , sire , I 'll retrieve my master this very moment & quot ; are here given the chance to argue the finer points of foreign birds and migratory patterns . Unimportant lackeys dive into in-depth dissertations at the drop of a hat , spiraling off into a tangent with little or no provocation . Literally hundreds of medieval cliches are addressed and promptly disposed of throughout the course of the film , while simple , obvious visual puns are thrown out like darts at every moment . It 's a film that anyone can enjoy , regardless of intelligence , age or demeanor . There 's literally something for everyone.Immediately , only seconds after popping this DVD into your hardware and hitting the & quot ; play & quot ; button , something is going to strike you as a little bit odd . Something 's different about this classic , but it 's tough to put your finger on it until the murky opening scenes are in the past . Bluntly enough , this new restoration looks BREATHTAKING . One of the toughest things to endure about the film 's earlier VHS incarnations was the god-awful quality of the video , the way everything had been overtaken by a sort of yellowish-brown hue , darkened and muddied . However , this most recent DVD release cleans up those long-standing visual stains with uncanny precision , revealing in its wake an entirely new motion picture . Wide shots of the infamous & quot ; Trojan rabbit & quot ; scene are awesome sights , now that the original color saturation is in place . It 's honestly as though someone took a cloth and some Windex to my television screen and wiped away thirty years ' worth of dust and muck . The restoration alone is worth upgrading the copy of Holy Grail in your collection from VHS to DVD.Fortunately enough , though , the crews in charge of this new DVD did n't stop there . With a full two discs in the set , almost every base is covered ... in addition to several spots in between . The discs come fully equipped with two feature-length commentary tracks ; one from directors Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones , and another from John Cleese , Eric Idle and Michael Palin . The commentary tracks are both thoroughly interesting , with the directors ' chat a little more insightful and the actors ' track more disjointed . Jones and Gilliam reveal a lot of obscure facts about the creation of the film that I had n't realized , such as the involvement of rock bands Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin in the production , and is generally a much better listen than its partner track . It 's strange , it almost feels like Cleese , Idle and Palin were n't even in the same room together when they recorded these audio tracks , and that various comments from each were merely spliced together at appropriate points throughout the film.The Special Features section is overflowing with options , including but not limited to three sing-alongs ( featuring full lyrics to the film 's three notable song-and-dance numbers ... if you ever wondered what they were trying to say during the incomprehensible verses of & quot ; We 're Knights of the Round Table , & quot ; today is your lucky day ) , a short film titled & quot ; How to Use Your Coconuts & quot ; ( which comes off as very , very forced and very , very stupid ) , a cast directory ( which shows just how many hats the actors wore throughout the course of the film ; Michael Palin alone played nearly a dozen characters ) , photos and more . In addition , the second disc showcases two unique featurettes about the film ; one which was shot on set in 1974 for the BBC , and another which reunites Gilliam and Jones in the year 2000 , on the location of the main castle used throughout filming.Without exaggeration , I seriously can not recommend this DVD any higher . It 's not humanly possible . Whether you 're a devoted , lifelong Python fan or merely someone with a passing interest in comedy in general , this is a worthwhile purchase . You wo n't find a better transfer of the film in your life , the list of features is almost overwhelming , the original team is represented nearly in full , through dual commentary tracks and several featurettes , and it 's very affordable at the same time . Go out and buy this now , before you forget .	1
The grand opus of Monty Python , a goofy gang of guys who invented the most skewed comedy routines in the world . Rather than a series of individual spoofs , this movie is a long spoof based on Arthurian legend ; specifically , the legend of the Holy Grail . Somehow , these six guys not only produced a low-budget movie , but cast themselves in multiple ( many multiple ) roles throughout it and still maintained a hilarious result ! Rather than a real story , this is a series of vignettes concerning the long-suffering King Arthur and his loyal knights of the Round Table ( & quot ; We eat ham and jam and Spam-a-lot ! & quot ; ) Among them are : *The encounter with the Communist peasants in their autonamous collective ( & quot ; HELP ! HELP ! I 'M BEING REPRESSED ! & quot ; ) *The Tale of Sir Robin , the cowardly knight with a chicken on his shield . *The king 's encounter with the loony black knight , in which a ridiculous series of blood-spurtings will have you guffawing . ( & quot ; You 've got no arms left ! & quot ; & quot ; Yes I have ! & quot ; & quot ; LOOK ! & quot ; & quot ; It 's just a flesh wound. & quot ; ) *Sir Lancelot receives a desperate note from a castle , but is the person sending it what he expects ? *The French attack ... . verbally . ( & quot ; Your mother was a hamster , and your father smelt of elderberries ! & quot ; ) *Sir Galahad is waylaid in the temptation-laden Castle of the Maidens ( interestingly enough , in traditional legends Sir Galahad did go to the Castle of the Maidens , though in very different circumstances *leer* ) *The Keepers of the Sacred Word , the Knights Who Say & quot ; NI ! & quot ; *The rabbit of death , Tim the Enchanter , and so much more.The sheer off-the-wallness is what sells this movie , and Monty Python was in rare form . Graham Chapman 's primary role is King Arthur , who seems to be the most competant of the bunch but is still pretty goofy . John Cleese of & quot ; Fish & quot ; and & quot ; Fawlty Towers & quot ; fame stars as Sir Lancelot/Tim the Wizard/The Rude Frenchman , and is amazing in each role . Eric Idle plays lily-livered Sir Robin/Roger the Shrubber ( do n't ask ) /Brother Maynard . Terry Gilliam is lower-key as Sir Gawain/Patsy ; Terry Jones is also pretty low key as Sir Bedivere/Prince Herbert . Michael Palin has a hilarious series of roles including the King os Swamp Castle/Sir Galahad/Leader of the Knights Who Say Ni.Shoring up the cast is Cleese 's now-ex-wife Connie Booth as The Witch , John Young as the Historian/Dead Body , Neil Innes as the annoying Minstrel/Page Killed by Rabbit.Perhaps the funniest move in this movie was mocking the budget limitations , with the coconut shells and so forth . The special effects are deliberately cheapened to make them sillier , such as the sprays of rather gloppy gore when someone is wounded . The script is typically hilarious , full of stupid comments and straight-faced jokes.Frankly , it 's hard to think of Camelot now without rhyming it with & quot ; I have to push the PRAM-A-LOT & quot ; and the line of tap-dancing knights . This movie is lodged in the American brain , and it ai n't budging soon ... A small note : You may want to check out the Veggie Tales ep & quot ; Josh and the Big Wall , & quot ; in which a respectful ( yet kooky ! ) homage is paid to this film !	1
British humor at its best or worse depending on your likes and dislikes of British humor if it can be called humor	1
This movie is a comedy Classic simply put . You 'll either love or hate the Monty Python humor , there is no in between . I 'm sure everyone is aware of the plot , and that it 's them making fun of the medieval times and king Arthur in his search for the Holy Grail . I got it as a Christmas gift , and it 's absolutely perfect ! The thing with this movie , is that it brings all its fans together over a wide age audience . My uncle is a Monty Python fanatic and it 's grown on me even before I knew he was . The quotes you find yourself saying make it more enjoyable the next time you watch it . The swallows , the virgins , the wedding , the witch , the 3 headed giant , the knights who say NI ! It 's all perfect , it 's got this shine to it , that will never disappear . I 've seen this movie so many times and well for me personally ; it 's never lost its touch . I 've seen the Spamalot play and even bought my own personal pair of coconuts . ( *chuckles* ) Anyways , rent this and see for yourself . You may not get all the jokes at first , or understand it . As the first time I saw this I was about 8-ish and other then the rabbit scene ( which is what I consider to be the best part of the movie ) I did n't get it . But then again , I was eight at the time . The second Disc with extras is great especially the Lego knights signing Knights of the Round Table . If you want to see the credits for disc two , highlight the Holy Grail on one of the menus , it 's an Easter egg . Although I have n't watched it with commentary yet , this is one ultimate package for Python fans everywhere ... .unless perhaps , you are French .	1
I ran this for my movie club . They loved it and found it extremely funny - both those who had seen it long ago and those seeing it for the first time.I thought I might find the movie religiously offensive - but it was not at all offensive.I know the Pythons wanted the movie to be completely absurd and nonsensical pointless.Maybe humans can never reach that without some of themselves showing through.In fact I thought the movie had some warmth and affection towards King Arthur and the whole story . Also made some good points about society.I think the English have sought the Holy Grail for two thousand years - and still do not know what it exactly is ( multiple theories ) , where it is ( let 's hope not in France ) or even IF it is.So some frustation about it is warrented . SPOILER : I thought bringing modernday characters in showed the lack of progress since 600 AD in finding the Holy Grail .	1
As you know King Arthur is one of the most ( if not the most ) reminded character of the Western tradition that overpasses by far the kingdom 's domains to inscribe in the essential paradigm and meaning about the lost values and the inability to get a true and effective unity in the love . All happiness is far to be innocent said Jean Anouilh . And the story of Arthur , Guinevere and Lancelot will be engaging to millions and millions future readers over and over again . The mythic roots are too powerful and survive far beyond any other circumstance or religious belief.Monthy Phyton makes a fantastic turn of page about this legend and precisely due its black humor doses , put us in context with some revelations that can not be told by reasons politically correct . The sense of irreverence , and sharp deformation of the personages helps still more to get a closer approach to the meaning of this legend.Go for this ever lasting cult movie and if I may express with absolute sincerity this is the real masterpiece of that legendary ensemble .	1
Monty Python took a hell of a chance making a full lenght motion picture , as the simple production and mostly strictly six man skits which characterized their TV show and their live performances since 1968 gave their brilliant scripts and acting their full power . With the Flying Circus behind them , however , and John Cleese already starting to work on his own project with his wife ( Fawlty Towers ) , Monty Python decided to take that chance , and it proved to be worth it , mainly due to the fact that Monty Python and the Holy Grail looks more like a collection of skits than a single story ; any attempt to follow the storyline will be quite disappointing . However , almost every scene is brilliant by itself , and the movie provides some of the most memorable moments and one-liners in comedy history.The perfect timing and team work of the Monty Python crew , which made 'Flying Circus ' one of the most popular shows in history , was transferred well to the big screen . Additional actors were kept to a minimum , so each of the Pythonists played several parts . As usual , the casting is wonderful , and each of the six actors brings life to all his characters , as each one gets one or two great scenes to show what he has to offer . Graham Chapman was given the role of the straight man ( sort of like Zeppo Marx only funnier ) and does a great job in the part of King Arthur , as well as an unforgettable short appearence as God ( & quot ; Every time I try to talk to someone it 's sorry this and forgive me that and I 'm not worthy ... & quot ; ) Terry Gilliam is , as usual , not given a very big part in the movie , but does a great work on his very few lines as both Patsy , Arthur 's trusty steed ( & quot ; It 's only a model. & quot ; ) and the keeper of the Bridge of Death , as well a short appearence as himself ( The Animator ) . His animation sequences on this movie are his absolute best . Director Terry Jones does a wonderful Sir Bedevere , supplying the brilliant witch scene , as well as the unforgettable Prince Herbert . Michael Palin is a great Sir Galahad , but is more memorable as Dennis ( & quot ; Help ! Help ! I 'm being repressed ! & quot ; ) and of course the leader of the Knights Who Say Ni . Eric Idle is dreadfuly funny as usual as Sir Robin , and also as Roger the Srubber , Brother Maynard , the Dead Collector ( & quot ; Bring out your dead ! & quot ; ) and Concorde . And most of all , John Cleese , making not only a wonderful Sir Launcelot , but also supply some of the film 's most memorable moments as the newt guy , Tim the Wizard , the rude French soldier and of course the Black Knight ( & quot ; It 's just a flesh wound ! & quot ; ) The comedic work of the Monty Python team , their scripts and their timing are flawless . Python 's humor is one that works on familiarity and not on surprise , and so I still enjoy it after watching it about twenty times - it 's the perfect kind of thing to own on video . Get the Holy Grail , as well as Life Of Brian , And Now For Something Completely Different , and Meaning Of Life . They will become your most precious earthly posessions .	1
Famous last words of the Black Knight guarding bridge over the creek . The best part of the DVD is the English subtitles . Having seen the flick repeatedly at dollar theatres , by turning on the English subtitles I was finally able to make out the lyrics to Knights of the Round table . It does n't get any better for a Python fan , except maybe in Life of Brian . I know you hate me for saying such a thing , all of you Grailers .	1
What can I say about this movie that has n't been said . It 's got to be one of the funniest of all time . I love most British/English comedy , and this is near the tops .	1
If you 're a big fan of Monty Python , then you 're already familiar with their style of humor . If not , this is a perfect place to get acquainted with the boys , as I know many people who know little about MP except for this film , and they all love it ! Monty Python 's Flying Circus , which aired on British television from 1969-1973 , is an original , funny , TV experience . The latitude that the group was given in terms of creativity is amazing . However , if one digs deeper , he/she learns that sometimes the BBC put the kibosh on some of the gags . In short , the Flying Circus shows were a testimony to the comic brilliance of John Cleese , Michael Palin , Terry Jones , Eric Idle , Terry Gilliam , and my personal favorite , the now deceased Graham Chapman . The other Python films are all great as well , including The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life . But in the end , I think we all keep coming back to this film as the first and funniest of the Python movies.I 'll not try to navigate through the `` plot '' as it would be futile . Instead , I 'd like to show what an excellent DVD this is . Not only do we have the film in widescreen ( that 's a must -- -do n't even try to get me to watch a film in `` pan and scan '' ! ) but there 's also some great extras including a 45 minute documentary where Michael Palin and Terry Jones revisit the old locations in Scotland where the film was shot . Who knew that the vast majority of the movie was shot in one old castle built in the early 14th century ? Not me . There 's also a neat little 17 minute BBC production called `` Film Night '' that shows on location interviews with all of the Pythons . You can also sing-along to all of the musical numbers and there 's a Lego version of the `` Nights of Camelot '' sequence ( It is a silly place ) .There are a lot of other extras that I 'll let you find out about for yourself . Above all , this is the kind of DVD that serious film fanatics and collectors drool over . One that has a great movie in widescreen and a lot of great extras .	1
This is without doubt the funniest movie ever made . It 's also the most intelligent movie ever made . Think about it you take 5 Britt 's who all went to Cambridge and Oxford you know you 're not in for dumb humor ( just very silly ) This had some of Monty 's best scenes . Opening with the mighty King Aurthur riding form in search of knights , with his trust servant Patsy in the back banging two empty half of coconuts to make the sound . And never ask how they found the coconuts please ! See Aurthur battle over liberated pheasants and vicious black knights , plus knights who say Ni ! You 'll meet Sir Lancelot the Brave , Sir Galahad the Pure , and Sir Robin The-Not-Quite -As-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot , and the aptly named Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film . You 'll face taunting Frenchman and Killer Bunnies as well . A bit of advice while watching this film . 1 . Know the air speed velocity of an un-laden swallow . And 2 . Know why witch 's burn . You will learn not to worry about horrid Black Beast 's Of AAAAAAAAAAAAA because the animator will surly suffer a fatal heart attack . Finally watch this film at your own risk . You might just die laughing .	1
If you 've never seen Monty Python before , this is the definitive starting point to all their movies . Actually , they are all great and I have a hard time deciding which one is my favorite , but this one is tops ... If you are already a Monty Python fan and do n't already own this , what are you waiting for ? ? ? For those who lack a funny bone , dislike tasteless humor or ca n't understand British Comedy , stick to Comedy Central , you ca n't be helped here .	1
It almost shames me to admit that , despite claiming to be a nerd , I had never seen a Monty Python film or sketch . Not `` Life of Brian , '' not `` Flying Circus , '' not even that ( ahem ) Holy Grail of nerdiness , `` Monty Python and the Holy Grail . '' Sure , I 'd heard many of the classic jokes and lines from it , from the Black Knight 's hysterical dismemberment to the Knights Who Say Ni ( and demand a shrubbery to boot ) , but I had never experienced it for myself . And given that it 's one of those movies that people either seem to really love or really hate , I was wary about watching it for myself.When a friend discovered I had never seen the movie , she decided to `` fix that '' by sitting me down and having me watch it with her . And my verdict ? It 's a bizarre film , and probably best in small doses , but it 's definitely hilarious.The story is a classic one - King Arthur organizes his Knights of the Round Table ( mostly offscreen ) and embarks on a quest to find that most sacred relic , the Holy Grail . Naturally , this is far easier said than done , and Arthur seems cursed with a retinue of Knights that are both easily distracted and not all that bright . And he must contend with some strange obstacles along the way , including but not limited to a three-headed giant , a band of rogue shrubbery-demanding knights , some rude Frenchmen , an enchanter named Tim , an inept but determined Black Knight , a killer rabbit , a castle full of beautiful and very lonely women , the police , bad animation , and much more.If British humor is n't your cup of tea , you probably wo n't enjoy this film very much . But if you do n't mind your humor surreal and slightly deadpan , you 'll probably get a kick out of this movie . It makes no effort to be historically accurate or serious and plays every single situation as goofily as possible . It also blatantly shatters the fourth wall at every opportunity , right up to the ridiculous climax of the film ( which I wo n't spoil here ) . It makes no sense , but it 's still laugh-out-loud funny.The film 's obviously a low-budget affair , but the actors and screenwriters seemed aware of this and worked it to their advantage as much as possible . Rather than ignore the fact that they could n't afford horses , they play it up as much as possible , even pointing out that they 're substituting a servant banging coconuts together for a proper horse ... and making the coconuts a running joke throughout the film . This actually adds to the surreal , screwball feel of the movie , rather than dragging it down.The film does feel like a lot of one-shot sketches strung together into a full-length film , however , and at times the humor can wear a little thin . This is probably best viewed as a party movie , or a piece at a time instead of in a single sitting by oneself . Though I 'm sure it could make for some hilarious drinking games or quote-along experiences.Not for all tastes , and the Internet has probably spoiled most of the jokes , but still worth a look and good for some side-splitting laughs . Best for ages 13 and up due to some off-color humor and a few scenes of over-the-top gore ( played for laughs , of course ) .	1
What is your name ? What is your quest ? What is the capitol of Constantinople ? This film is so much fun .	1
My husband introduced me to this comedic film that is `` Monty Python And The Holy Grail . '' He has owned this dvd for over ten years now and was able to explain some of the scenes to me while allowing me to discover what happens . There are 28 scenes available in this collection and one of my favorite scenes was the humorous part where one of the knights ends up in a castle of several women that apparently want to `` take care of him in their own way . '' `` Monty Python And The Holy Grail '' is great to watch for those moments when you 're craving something to make you laugh .	1
Well , having been a fan of this film for a long time and through different DVD and now Blu-ray copies i must say that the movie does look better yes , BUT this is a `` CUT '' version and that is my main complaint . The Blu-ray edition finds the mistaken beginning of `` DENTIST ON THE JOB '' REMOVED ! To be a true edition of the film and a `` complete '' edition this should not happen ! Why for many years over several VHS and Multiple DVD 's present it in it 's original form only to cut the original beginning completely from the movie ? I mean it was ok in the ultimate editions and such on the remasters to ( in my opinion since it sounds very slightly different ) re-dub narration , but to remove part of the movie ? Who OK 'd this ? ! ? ! ? !	1
Out of all the movies I have ever seen , this must be the funniest out there ! It has an actual plot , and although it 's corny , that gives it half the flavor ! I mean come on- a lady banging a cat against a wall for no apparent reason ? The swallow discussion ? All those 'not quite dead people ' ? This is n't just a guy movie -Hey- I 'm a girl- This is a movie for anyone with a sense of humor ! You will find yourself memorizing quotes like no other ! This is a very unique flick , scenes that are just crazy enough to work ! I think it should 've been rated PG-13 though ! Now go buy it you sons of a silly person !	1
Given all that we know about the legends of King Arthur , the Holy Grail , and Knights Who Say Ni , it 's about time someone crammed them all together in one movie . Not to mention some very nice shrubbery . Well , back in 1975 , the lunatics that were Monty Python decided to destory any credibility these legends might have.This brilliant farce is the stuff of legend itself . What with Wizards called Tim , killer bunny rabbits , and one knight that just does n't know when to quit.If you 've never seen this film , shame on you . It should be required viewing for every member of the human race .	1
This is a great and funny movie and one of the best that the Python team came up with ! And the 2 disc edition here is great , but i recomend you get a good price ! The bonus features are packed into 2 discs but there not somthing you would watch over and over again ! The movie is worth it mostly just for the classic film , and the people who have seen and loved the film will enjoy the bonus materials , espechelly the return to locations where it was filmed , and seeing what it looked like when they did the documentry in 2000 or whenever ?	1
I assume anyone reading this review has already seen the movie . The movie is damn funny . Now the Special Edition DVD , that 's a different story . This DVD is filled with so many `` extras '' that you 'll be pooping bonus material for weeks . However , the bonus material is complete fluff . It is not funny like the movie , just plain dumb . It reminds me of that line , `` the bad news is all we have to eat for breakfast is horse [ dung ] , but the good news is there 's plenty of it . `` Personally I think they are trying to make fun of all the other special edition DVDs out there . I guess that 's kind of funny but not nearly as funny as humourous bonus footage could 've been.I gave this DVD 4 stars : 5 for the movie and -1 for the [ dumb ] DVD special features . So in conclusion , my advice is : BUY THIS DVD FOR THE MOVIE ITSELF .	1
Several years ago Azon included a Leonard Maltin review in the notes , and it was obvious by the review that he either had n't seen the movie , or at least had n't paid attention , he had characters and scenes out of place . I posted a review that said ( more or less ) , who cared what Maltin had to say about anything anyway . Believe it or not , apparently Maltin read the page , took umbrage with my comments , managed to get Azon to reveal my personal information , and actually had an assistant call me at work to complain about my comments ! True story .	1
It never fails , regardless of where you live , there is someone that knows Holy Grail punch-lines verbatim . The reason , of course , is because it 's one of the funniest movies ever made and if you have n't purchased this movie ( or even seen Monty Python to begin with ) I would whole-heartedly recommend this movie . Even from the start with the opening credit jokes , this movie sets the standards for all-time creativity with comedy . If you do n't find this movie funny , I am trully sorry for you , because you might not have a sense of humor .	1
So , where to begin , i could say 'this is a classic ' and 'best movie ever ' BUT I WONT ! This film is the film that is funny to everyman on the planet . Monty python at there best and for me , it doesnt get any better than that ! The sketches become a film without you even noticing , i have seen it many many times and i see something new every single time . What makes python great is you never know what they are thinking so everytime you see a scene you see it in a different way . The nights who say ni are perhaps the most famous , but lets not forget 'roger the shrubber ' or the gorilla turning the pages of the book ... the black night ... the three headed knight ... the professor ... or the wedding ... i could do the whole film right here for you but you know what , i wont , go and buy the DVD , ESPECIALLY if you havent seen the film , where have you been ?	1
Greetings ! I 've always loved this film since childhood , but I had a real problem with the packaging . Disc One was loose in the box , with no way to secure it , but Disc Two was secured with a central hub that I absolutely could not remove the disc from to save my life . The wheels on my car are not held as securely , and I was very concerned about breaking the disc in my attempts . I even made a futile attempt to bang it with a coconut , to no avail . I finally ended up sacrificing the `` collector value '' of the packaging and quite literally destroying the central hub with an X-Acto knife and a drill burr to remove the disc without destroying it . Knowing Python , I could almost see this as some part of a larger joke , but not quite . Did anyone else have this problem , or did I just purchase an unusually tenacious box , or am I just a clod ? Thanks !	1
Monty Python at its finest ! The anniversary edition is more than worth the price ... the special features are especially fun ! I think my favorite is the & quot ; Subtitles for people who do not like the film , taken from Henry IV Part II by William Shakespeare. & quot ; Of course the Killer Rabbit accountant feature is also funny - if you 've ever wanted to make a movie but you do n't have the cash , you must needs watch this !	1
This movie is great . 'Nuff said . The DVD has some really interesting extras in it where they show you the castle it was shot at and which rooms all the scenes were in.If you are a Monty Python fan , this is a great DVD to add your collection .	1
This is actually a funny movie , even after all this time . Nothing seems outdated in the least . The print of the film is surprisingly clear , a step above the average 1970 's comedy . They seem to have overdefined the term `` bonus content '' as there is some stuff that appears random , like the film in Lego mode ! If you like British humor , than you should definitely see this movie , if you have n't already seen it , at this time . If you have seen it and liked it , this is the version to buy , for sure !	1
After making a film version of their best Flying Circus bits ( And Now For Something Completely Different ) , the Pythons wanted to make an original movie . They realized that the quest for the Holy Grail would lend itself nicely to a series of sketches focusing on each knight . For a climax , they planned on sending the knights into Herrods department store to buy the grail ( because , after all , Herrods sells everything ) .But somewhere along the way , this collection of medieval skits became one of the best comedies ever made . You could credit the use of authentic sets and costumes . For some reason , making the movie historically accurate makes it funnier . Or you could credit the way they used their painfully low budget -- - like using different sides of a castle to represent multiple castles in the story . If you notice it , you get an extra laugh . Or you could credit the use of two directors , forcing everyone to get it right the first time to avoid two sets of solutions to every problem.Whatever the reason , Monty Python and the Holy Grail holds up as one of the best comedies ever filmed . It still looks cheesy , but in a good way . The plot is full of nice big holes , too . Every time you see it , you notice something new and miss something you 've memorized . The jokes do n't wait for a laugh track . It 's just one strange punchline after another.For the special edition of the DVD , the five living Pythons put together a handful of extra bits . The best extras are the audio tracks . You hear the directors talk about set design , John Cleese complains about being wet and cold , and Michael Palin explains why everything is funny . The documentary in which the two Terrys ( the directors ) visit the old filming locations is fun , too . They still have their sense of humor about it all . If you like to laugh , you should buy this DVD and watch it over and over until you 've memorized every line . If you do n't like to laugh , you are a very strange person .	1
Ah yes , Monty Python and the Holy Grail : One of the funniest movies EVER made . Who could forget the coconuts replaced for a horse , or the famous lines like `` Its ' just a flesh wound '' and `` We are the nights who say 'ni ' ! '' ? It may have been low budget , but if you think about it , those are usually the best kinds of movies around.The movie is layden with completely random parts , but you can tell the characters in the movie know it 's random so it works for the film . The arguments over the swallows carrying coconuts , the black night scene , the scene where you `` Bring out ya dead ! `` , the nights who say `` ni '' , and the very , VERY random scene with the animated sun and clouds yelling `` Stand up ! Stand up ! '' This is all pretty confusing at first , but that 's the genius of Monty Python . And these sorts of scenes seem to fit in no matter how bizzare they are . And you just got ta love the beginning with the subtitles continuously being messed up , with some guy typing about his sister getting bitten by a moose . The ending is probably my only complaint , as it 's so abrupt and kinda leaves a little to be desired.This version comes with some great bonus features : The commercial that inspired the coconuts idea , the sites for the castle shots , and some random ones as well . One of my favorites would have to be on the first disc , where you click on the bonus features and someone says , `` Please insert the second disc . '' Then 5 seconds later you hear , `` No , into the DVD player , '' and you hear someone zipping his pants up ! Probably the biggest treat on the DVD is the Kamelot scene done entirely with legos - very cool feature . It would have been even better if they included the WHOLE movie in lego form , but oh well ... .The movie is 5 stars all the way , but I do have on complaint . On the packaging , you are promised a completely remastered version of the movie , but the picture is as gritty and dreary as ever . And it 's annoying as hell to see little parts of the movie in crystal clear picture on one of the bonus features . I mean , why they did n't just do that for the whole movie ? But that 's a very small complaint , because we 're talking about Monty Python and the Holy Grail here . Even if the picture is never remastered , at least will still have one of the greatest comedies of all time .	1
Who , besides my wife , does n't love this movie . Watched it with my 3 kids , ages 9-15 after receiving and there was much rejoicing . Classic British comedy that is mostly kid friendly . So many classic bits rolled into a comedic masterpiece .	1
As a teacher of medieval Grail literature , I have shown `` Monty Python and the Holy Grail '' to many generations of students -- and indeed there are a number of scenes that really do help young people understand either the medieval literary tradition or medieval history . These include not only the unforgettable `` Bring out your dead scene , '' which educates the fortunate modern viewer on the ubiquity of the medieval Bubonic Plague , but also the Grail Castle with its unimaginable and unaskable question , not to mention the over-the-top battle ethos that would lead to a knight 's having not only his arms and legs cut off but also his head ! It 's hard to believe that such scenes have their medieval progenitors ( though I do have to say I know of no medieval precedent for the `` shrubbery '' scene ) , but honestly they do.More than that , however , in my book the very best scene of this film has absolutely nothing to do with the Grail or with anything medieval -- and that is the scene of the fierce rabbit . I still can not watch this film without cracking up ( as we moderns say ) over the scene in which the `` harmless little rabbit '' attacks the Arthurian troupe . The hubris that the rabbit scene uncovers is a sadly ( but hilariously ) universal feature of human nature.But even the rabbit scene hooks back into the medieval theme , as it links to an exploration of a cave with literary texts that conclude because `` ... .arrgh ... . '' Well , indeed , many medieval texts remain unfinished , perhaps because the authors died , more likely due to the vagaries of preservation . So Monty Python has something to say not only about history and literature but about literary history ; in its very aesthetic form , this film reminds us that the standard linear narrative is not the only way of organizing a story . Many medieval stories are likewise structured either allegorically or with significant disruptions , such as this film has , that reveal that a story is something that is constructed and has its gaps and interventions.In the `` Age of the Da Vinci Code '' -- another far less successful Grail story -- I 'd be happy to see folks go back to Monty Python for their understanding of medieval literature and Chrisitainity . Maybe they 'd learn that all enigmas are not meant to be solved ; some are meant to be the topic of cleansing and cathartic laughter .	1
this movie supposedly so controversal that it was practically banned , and unable to rent or even buy , until now . it tells the south as it is , and as it was ! ! ! As unpleasant as it might be to look at how the blacks were treated , this is our american history ! ! ! ! Roots depicted exactly how things were in the lives of slaves and was one of the most watched ever . We cried , we hid our faces , we struck our breasts in humility and shame that we allowed the treatment of blacks , and even shared in this.Generations have passed , and there still is not equality.A lot of the southern ways refuse to accept that change was long long overdue , and still cling to the old biases and prejudice ( despite there are laws now , and a black President ) Getting back to this movie -- -- -- -- it speaks of prejudices'it speaks of derogotary terms for blacks a lot ; it speaks of mores and attitudes of the time ; it speaks of the poor whites during the depression trying to survive and raise their families . The greatest parts of this movie was the COMPASSION AND DIGNITY IN DYING THAT WAS SHOWN TO SHADRACK ! ! tHIS FAMILY TREATED THIS OLD BLACK MAN WITH RESPECT , LOVE , KINDNESS , AND TOTALLY IGNORED THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN -- THEY TREATED HIM AS A FELLOW HUMAN BEING ! ! ! ! ! ! I ca n't say enough for the message that this movie sent out -- -it educated me and us -- that 's the way life and relationships should be . I recommend this -- its historical , its geographical , its spiritual , and really makes us think , and hopefully be better people.thanks .	1
I did n't know about this film but it came on tv today . There is a little boy who is the only child of a well to do family in Virginia in 1935 during the Depression . while his parents decide to go to Baltimore to a family funeral , they decide to leave the son Paul with the Dabney 's . A seemingly ne'er do well family for a week , reluctantly while they go to a funeral . It is there that Paul and his Dabney friend encounter Shadrack , a 99 year old man who hitched rides and walked from Alabama , where he lived for the past 70 plus years to Virginia , where he was born and die there . It seems the Dabney 's were slaveholders , but at that point , they were barely scratching just trying to survive.The head of the house , played by Harvey Keitel , is a bootlegger , trying to make a few dollars and keep his family going . His wife , played by Andie McDowell , is a beer drinking , yet warm hearted woman , who takes Shadrack in and take him to the old homestead as he wished . Well , the sheriff , thanks to his bootleg partner , whose do n't trust Paul to keep their secret but would sure tell the sheriff everything , is breathing down Keitel 's throat to have a respectable colored funeral home put old Shadrack to rest . This do n't sit well with Keitel , but to keep the peace , he goes and meets with the funeral director and though he do n't like it , he goes with it . The ending is priceless .	1
Very entertaining movie with a great performance . It has very colorful scenes and Catherine Zeta Jones looks beautiful in her dance dress .	1
A tongue in `` sheet '' film that carries to pretenses , many laughs andhigh humor . As for it being racist , huh ? Lots of flaws in thie movie butbeing racist is not one of them . I never discredit someone 's honest reaction to a film , but c'mon ! Disregard the racist monker and rentthe film . If you saw it in the theater , rent it again . Not as funny because you knew the jokes in advance . It 's silly . It 's fun . Paranormalpsychiology is to me voodoo science . And voodoo science is easy toparody . They did . It worked .	1
I am not exactly sure what people are complaining about in regards to the picture quality of this Blu-Ray transfer . It looks better then the recent 1080i that was put out recently on cable . Now of course , you are talking about video effects from 1984 , state of the art for that time , but pale compared to what is offered today . So yes , Blu-Ray is going to accentuate the video effects . But overall this is a great offering that has lots of extras . Extras include cinechat , for internet connected players a way to watch the film with a chat room where you can invite friends and family across the country . Also for internet connect players is BD-Live in which you can access online Sony content like Ghostbusters Ring Tones , and exclusive extra content on not only this movie but other Sony movies as well as up to date previews . There is something called Slimer Mode where there is a box with ongoing commentary by the actors , directors and others involved as the movie plays . Blu-Wizard is a way to make a play list of the extras and save it . Extras include material made at the time of the film , and for the 1999 release and a new documentary of refurbishing Ecto-1 , the Ghostbusters car . A bonus I found when I popped it into my PS3 is under Games is free PS3 Ghostbusters them that is pretty cool and features the Sta-Puff Marshmallow Man and slime . Overall , with a ton of cool extras , a decent Blu-Ray transfer , you just ca n't go wrong.ADDENDUM : I decided to watch the Blu-Ray along with HDNET Movies recent 1080i showing on my largest TV switching back and forth . There are lots of artifacts on both versions , especially on wide angle and indoor shots . Some are very apparent like the Dean 's coat when he is kicking them out of the university , the cabinet behind the male student getting shocked , and dark objects in the background of many wide angle scenes have bright pinpoints of light like when you increase the brightness of an underexposed photo . Seeing how some shots on both versions have these artifacts and others have little or none , it has to be indicative of the quality of the master print and type of film and lenses used . Its still worth the price with the extras included .	1
I have so many memories with this movie and when it was release on Blu-Ray I had to snatch it up . It looks great and sounds great and has some great content with it as well !	1
This movie came out the year I was pregnant with my daughter and I remember laughing so hard in the theater that she kicked me and I had to get up and move around to rock her to go back to sleep ! ; pThrough the years she and I shared that same laughter in person as we saw it on cd , dvd and television . When I just want a movie weekend to relax and unwind , this is one of a few I pop in while a pizza bakes in the oven and it still tickles my funny bone !	1
If you like the Ghostbusters movies then you 'll want this for you and the entire family that enjoys a comedy .	1
If you remember the eighties , there is no way you do n't remember Ghostbusters . This film was more than just a movie when it came out , it was an event . Who did n't have one of those T-Shirts ? I think I still have mine somewhere ... Of course , I would n't be writing this review if I thought the movie was simply all hype . Beneath all the marketing , toys and catchy song lies a very funny film . The type of comedy we hardly see these days . Ghostbusters is quite a clever mix of comedy along with bits of other genres including a bit of horror . The anchor being the great performances of Dan Akroyd , Harold Ramis , Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson , all in the peak of their careers in comedy at the time . I 'm not going to go real deep into the film as I want to discuss the Blu-Ray transfer but it 's a great script , has wonderful acting and a great pace . The special effects might look a bit out of date in this age of CG but some hold up pretty well more then 20 years later.So this film is finally available in HD and its looking great . A lot of the details lost over the years are back and the colors , especially the ones involving the special effects come out strong and bright . Even when in theaters , the film had a grainy , subdued look to it , similar to Saving Private Ryan . Whether that was the director 's intent or simply bad quality film , the years were certainly not helpful in improving it . A lot was lost when the film was finally released on VHS and DVD did nothing to help that . This BD really does the film justice but it is by no means comparable to recent releases . The film is after all , over 20 years old . But there is no doubt this is the best this film has looked ever . Better perhaps than in theaters.Where this release really shines is in the Special Features department , with a plethora of content from multiple commentaries to documentaries . They not only have included material from when the film came out along with extras from previous releases but brand new content as well . Especially noteworthy is the inclusion of a picture in picture track where several people , among them Ivan Reitman , Dan Akroyd and the other actors , producers and other people involved in the film comment along with the movie . Must see stuff ! Ghostbusters is a must-buy in and of itself so I would recommend it to anyone who likes comedy but this release really sweetens the deal . The transfer is awesome , the extras are many and that song ... well who can forget that ?	1
Everything Harold Ramis touches turns to gold ; Animal House , Caddy Shack , Groundhog Day , Stripes and , of course , Ghost Busters . GB is a comedy classic blending clever humor and intelligent science fantasy . No , it 's not even scary , just damn funny with enough of a supernatural coloring and engaging amount of pseudo-scientific babble to keep any fanzine geek happy . Actually , this movie is such a classic that I do n't even know why I 'm reviewing it ... if you have yet to see this film , then you must not watch TV or go to the movies . If you have seen it and do n't care for it , then you 're probably a fan of European & quot ; art & quot ; films with boring story lines and terrible dialogue ... . BUT HEY , even if you do n't like sci-fi , and even if you do n't like comedy ( ! ) , see this movie for the CUTE CHICKS ; Sigourney Weaver , Annie Potts , and Slavitza Jovan ( she plays Gozer ... check her out in any of the B-movies she 's been in the past 16 years ... see the IMDB ) . See this movie and have some fun !	1
Ok im not gon na review the movie . but the quality . The colors are very more vibrant on the 4k . there is still a lot of grain in the movie but you must remember it is a very old movie . wish it had the special features on it . but for the price it is very cheap . I do believe that the 4k is still a few with years away from being perfect . if you do n't mind the special features missing on it then I suggest you go with the 4k has the colors to show a better picture . i also think this technology is still five years from being mastered . if you were looking for a great upgrade then this is not the movie for it . if you do not own this movie then this is the version to buy . now Sony could just figure out a way to make their 4k TVs 240 mhz . but like i said . its a nice upgrade , but if you already own the Blu ray I suggest you wait .	1
Peter ( Bill Murray ) , Egon ( Harold Ramis ) and Ray ( Dan Ackroyd ) are college drop-outs create a unusual but successful business of paranormalist called `` Ghostbusters '' who uses proton-blasters and special traps to capture poltergeists and demons . Later a newcomer named Winston ( Ernie Hudson ) joins the squad , a lovely musician named Dana ( Sigourney Weaver ) lives in a apartment building that use to be the home of a cult of worshippers of ancient beings and it 's haunted . Now a horde of spirits and demons with goblins appear in the city as the powerful Gozer will take over the world , now it 's up the Ghostbusters to end it all.Co-starring Rick Moranis and William Atheron , this movie is a brilliant mix of horror , comedy and fantasy all tied together in one serious crowdpleaser of a movie . This movie has became one of the greatest motion pictures ever and one of the most beloved yet successful movies of all time , it still holds up to many generations among kids to adults as it never grows old and remains fresh . The concept of the film itself is genius and has an H.P . Lovecraft-esque feel to it , the performances are just outstanding and the special effects still hold up in this digital age . I loved this movie since i was 3 back in 1985 when my mom bought me the movie and i became a fan instantly as i watched the TV show , collected the toys , watched the sequel in the theaters in 1989 and it 's the coolest movie of that decade . The theme song by Ray Parker Jr. still remains popular today even at halloween parties and the film still delights audiences both old and newcomers alike , it 's one of the most original and unique motion picture experiences ever.This DVD contains great picture and sound with extras like Audio Commentary including an MST3K style video commentary , Trailers to this and other Columbia releases , Deleted scenes , Storyboard comparisions , conceptual art gallery , featurettes and photo gallery .	1
Since I was extremely young , Ghostbusters has remained one of my fave movies . The cast is pure genius - Bill Murray , Harold Ramis , Dan Akroyd , Sigourney Weaver and the hilarious Rick Moranis . Set in the great New York City , the public are terrifyed by ghostly occurances and the Ghostbusters are there to help . A building , so strange yet bewitching becomes the gateway for the spirits and before long the city faces a fate worse than death ... .who ya gon na call ? ... GHOSTBUSTERS ! ! The story is great and the humour created by the cast is beyond hilarious ... well done ! ! A movie that will go down in history as one of the funniest most well produced movie ever ! Only one bad thing about this dvd edition is that it only plays half of the movie - this is probably due to the RCE feature , it was disapointing to get so into the movie and then have it stop . But great movie ! !	1
cela faisait longtemps que je voulais revoir ce film dans de bonnes conditions , c'est chose faite avec cette tr & egrave ; s belle & eacute ; dition !	1
Just about everyone loves Ghostbusters . Having it Blu Ray just makes it all the better . It 's a great movie , although it scared my daughter a little bit . I would recommend this to anyone who likes Ghostbusters , or if you have n't seen it yet .	1
A movie that can be watched again and again , and it never stops being funny . Great cast and a great job with its production of .	1
Unfortunately my kids LOVE this movie and we watch it over and over , and over again . It was n't bad enough that I could already quote the movie with out watching it ! Still a classic and will continue to watch it over again !	1
I 'd have to say , Ghostbusters I is still an old favorite . Bill Murray was/is terrific in this ; this is his funniest comedy to date . The script was original , the music had good beats , and dialogue snappy . The story actually made sense ( unlike GB II ) and the suspense of Gozer made me feel like New York City , the world , the Ghostbusters themselves were in big time trouble.Quite an excellent movie and is a timeless classic . they should NOT make another GB sequel , please , Harold Ramis , Ivan Reitman , do us a favor and yourselves a favor -- DON't do another Ghostbusters movie !	1
SNL 's Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are the ultimate ghost hunters in the supernatural comedy hit `` Ghostbusters '' . After being fired from Columbia University , parapsychology professors Peter Venkman ( Murray ) , Ray Stantz ( Aykroyd ) and Egon Spengler ( Harold Ramis ) open their own ghost extermination business . When an evil being from a spiritual dimension invades New York City , these unlikely heroes use their unique talents and special ghost-catching gadgets to save Manhattan from menacing ghosts . Written by stars Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis , `` Ghostbusters '' is a creative mix of witty humor and amusing fantasy . The 1984 smash hit grossed over $ 250 million worldwide and became one of the most successful comedies of the 1980s . `` Ghostbusters '' features an imaginative storyline , memorable characters , very big laughs and great visual effects . Bill Murray , Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis deliver some excellent comic performances . The cast also includes Rick Moranis , Annie Potts , Ernie Hudson , William Atherton and Sigourney Weaver.Columbia TriStar has certainly put some effort in developing this Collector Series DVD . The blockbuster comedy is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 widescreen format . The DVD contains a great video transfer with fine sharpness . The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is well-balanced and quite clear . The DVD features a wide range of special features including deleted scenes , theatrical trailers and three behind-the-scenes featurettes . The visual commentary with director Ivan Reitman , producer Joe Medjuk and actor/writer Harold Ramis is very informative and entertaining . The interactive DVD menus are inventive and pretty cool . With its clear widescreen presentation and great supplemental extras , `` Ghostbusters '' is one of the best Columbia TriStar DVDs and earns a winning `` A '' .	1
Unlike a lot of other movies being pushed as family fare today , this movie actually had a lot of plot and was enjoyable for all ages . 3 unconventional scientists ( and one mechanic/all purpose man ) go into business for themselves and face all kinds of wacky legal and social mishaps before saving New York City and the world from a major demon.Although Akroyd is shown smoking ( something that is unlikely to surface in today 's family movies ) in buildings , the superb acting and special effects negate it 's presence . The infamous Stay Puff climax is still really awe inspiring even after the introduction of computer animation . New special effects does not always mean better.The only reason why the movie dates itself is the inference of EPA officials as mean-spirited and reckless bureaucrats ( even if the actual equipment used by the men could constitute an environmental hazard ) . That this particular agency is selected is signifigant , because in real life , then-president Ronald Reagan won election promising to free businesses from real and perceived overregulation by EPA officials . The EPA as villan is quintesential 80 's	1
I saw `` Ghostbusters '' two years ago in Seattle at the Cinerama . It was a 70mm projection and gorgeous ! Of course there was plenty of dirt , scratches etc . It was an old film print . Very well loved ! And still the projection of film was a real treat ! Now comes `` Ghostbusters '' on blu-ray . The transfer looks almost as good as the 70mm version I saw at Cinerama . Maybe better . The transfer is clean . No scratches . No dirt . Many shots have a 3-D quality . Including shots of the gargoyle statues . The Stay Puft Marshmellow Man has n't looked so good . The only noticable issue is grain . Grain is good . This makes a movie retain its original theatrical look.Many customers will argue the transfer is so grainy it 's unwatchable . Untrue ! You will be disappointed if you 're looking for a Lowry Digital 4k restoration transfer or if you compare this to any Bond Blu-ray or other modern films , you will be sad ! `` Ghostbusters '' is a product of 1980s with use of heavy grain film stock . My `` Donnie Darko '' Blu-ray is a worse transfer than `` Ghostbusters '' . All of the optical shots are clean and vivid . This is a great Blu-ray and recently one of my favorites ! I even compared the DVD and obviously , 480i does not stand a chance to 1080p . The Blu-ray is much superior ! Do n't listen to others complaining about grain . This was shot on film in 1984 ! ! ! There is bound to be loads of grain . And the worst parts of noticeable grain happen in the first moments . The rest is nothing . Sony did a great job with the solid transfer . The special features are alright . Nothing to write home about .	1
& quot ; We 've been going about this all wrong . This Mr. Stay-Puft is o.k . He 's a sailor . He 's in New York . We get this guy layed we wo n't have any trouble. & quot ; - Pimpin ' ai n't easy in & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; After 20 years since its 6/8/84 release , & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; became the biggest surprise hit of the summer of '84 and has generated a hit sequel , a popular cartoon series , a # 1 hit single , by Ray Parker Jr. , thats an ode to parapsychology , the world over ( I ai n't 'fraid of no ghost ! ) and has mass produced legions of no ghost t-shirts . The film showcases the best talent from its principal cast and & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; is one of Ivan Reitman 's best films to date.After being kicked out of NYU , three Parapsychologists decide to go into business for themselves , becoming an elite team of paranormal investigators & amp ; iliminators known , thru out the New York tri-state area , as the & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; . There first case is a big one , as an ancient evil , known as Gozer , the Gozarian , awakens and is hellbent on ruling Earth , starting with the great state of New York.The cast is great , with Bill Murray giving one of his best performances to date . Writer , Dan Aykroyd wrote & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; with John Belushi , Eddie Murphy and John Candy in mind . But , with the tragic death of Belushi , the meteoric popularity of Murphy ( and his salary ) , & amp ; Candy not coming to grips with his character ( he wanted Louis Tully to speak in a German accent with him owning , like , five Rottwielers for some unknown reason ) Aykroyd retooled & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; with Murray , himself , Harold Ramis , and Ernie Hudson as the team and Rick Moranis as the accountant geek who has a diehard crush on Dana Barrett ( Sigourney Weaver ) . The film is loaded with one-liners that would fit right at home emblazoned on a t-shirt . The effects hold up well over the twenty years and I only spotted two or three effects that actually look cheesy.After the film became a success , in late summer'84 & amp ; as a test , the producers decided to take the commercial the & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; use in the film ( Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night ? ) , taking the 555 number and exchanging it with an operating toll free 800 number . The results were 1,000 calls an hour , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , over a six week test . The total of all calls is approx . 1,008,000 calls ! ! The word Gozer comes from an actual haunting in New England , that , oddly enough , is also the film & quot ; Poltergeist & quot ; is loosely based on . Thru out the haunting the word Gozer would appear , mysteriously , on walls and belongings all thru the house with no essential meaning of the word.The 1999 , 15th anniversary DVD release of & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; is the best format to watch the film ( rumor has it that Columbia/Sony may release a 20th anniversary edition in late '04 early '05 ) . The DVD features deleted scenes , trailers , a great trivia track that runs at the bottom of the screen while the movie is being shown , and commentary by Harold Ramis ( co-writer ) , Ivan Reitman ( director ) , and Michael C. Gross ( co-producer ) . & quot ; Ghostbusters & quot ; is still a great film that deserves shelf space in any great DVD collection.After 20 years , they still are ready to believe you .	1
Great entertainment , really worth the cash ! ! A good enough andidote to & quot ; Stephen King movies & quot ; ? ? ?	1
The movies are both a solid B but when you put them together on one DVD is a great buy . The scenes with the `` android '' guy are hilariously bad .	1
This is a good DVD.I just love how it has two movies on it ! You should buy it !	1
this is a good movie godzilla vs mothra 2 battle for earth and godzilla vs king ghidorah and godzilla always wins great dvd to watch i recommend it	1
Actually , the best G flicks started at Godzilla 1985 . Every one after that was great and entertaining to watch , even in late , late teens ! I grew up with godzilla and was excited to see that the 'final ' batch of movies made it here . Godzilla vs. King Ghidora was the worst of these 90 's flicks though . The lame , confusing plot ( as if all G movies are n't like that , this one just takes the cake ) undoes every previous Godzilla movie before it . For some reason , they decided to give Godzilla a brand new origin , instead of the original origin as represented in Godzilla Raids Again , the first sequel waaaay back when . In this movie , which is VERY politically motivated , a band of american soldiers land on an island inhabited by JApanese soldiers during WWII . A 'Godzillasaurus ' lives on this island , and is promptly dispatched by those 'filthy americans ' , with a terribly ear-piercing punchline by one of the american naval officers : 'Take that you dinosaur ! ' . Then it gets up again , and kills all the of the soldiers . Very anti-American , this movie was made during a trade dispute in the early 90 's . Aside from the 'Kill Whitey ' sub-plot , Godzilla is 're-created ' when we americans launch a nuclear bomb onto that island ( but i thought it was dropped on Hiroshima ... ..but ok ) . And thus , Godzilla is born . So , every movie is undone , because the Godzilla monster is then 'transported ' into the future . Which would mean Godzilla never attacked Japan ever . And when he shows up , everyone immediately knows 'GODZILLA ! ' . Major plot hole . But hey , it 's Godzilla , what the hell do you expect ? Still a great flick and the introduction of Mecha-Ghidora . Godzilla really kicks Ghidorah 's arse in this film , something he was never able to do by himself before . The movies that followed became quite interesting and entertaining . The 90 's godzilla surely was the best . After the franchise was handed over to America and we butchered it , it was then brought back to Toho , and here we have Godzilla 2000 , which i have yet to see . Ca n't wait !	1
What can I say ? Having not seen the & quot ; new & quot ; Godzilla and just remembering the silly rubber suited wrestlers of the 60 's , these Japanese imports from the 90 's are very welcome . I wished the DVD had 5.1 surround sound and more features but the included theatrical trailers are not dubbed and are a hoot . I love how at the end of the trailers , they try to hawk Godzilla toys . Now I understand how Pokemon is so damn well marketed . A welcome addition to any Godzilla-philes 's collection . Maybe in the future other Godzilla DVDs will be available with subtitles and actual Japanese dubbing that can be toggled on or off . ( for us & quot ; purists & quot ; )	1
This review contains SPOILERS for GODZILLA VS KING GHIDORAHThere comes a time in one 's appreciation of Godzilla that acceptance of the silly becomes necessary . It is true that the serious Godzilla films are generally the best , but demanding such a tone from of all of the monster 's movies will result in prolonged disappointment . It is with this open-mindedness that we must approach Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah . Its absurdities and pointlessness are not flaws but are sources of entertainment , revealing it to be a film that just wants to have fun by providing some kaiju action and the chance to laugh condescendingly.The very progression of the plot is the film 's first source of ridiculousness . It involves a group of `` Futurians '' from 2204 visiting modern-day ( 1992 ) Japan and telling them they have to go back to 1944 to kill Godzilla so that the beast does n't wipe Japan off the map like they say he eventually does in their original timeline . But the Futurians are secretly up to something else , and they bring along three cute little flying creatures that they leave behind to get amalgamated , mutated , and made enormous by the hydrogen bomb tests that originally transformed Godzilla into the form he is in today . Their plan , in fact , is to create a monster better than Godzilla because Godzilla did not actually destroy Japan . Japan became a superpower nation greater than the world has ever known , and the Futurians want to stop that from happening . Laser beams , more time travel , and bad special effects ensue.If Godzilla purists ( if there is such a thing ) are not put off by the silliness of this movie , they will be put off by the liberties the film takes with Godzilla continuity ( if there is such a thing ) . This movie alters the origin of the monster from the first film by positing that Godzilla somehow existed as a living dinosaur on Lagos Island up until he was transformed by the H-bomb tests ( originally , the creature resided in the deepest , freezing depths of the sea ) . Also , whereas King Ghidorah was an alien in his first appearance ( in Ghidorah : The Three-Headed Monster , 1964 ) , he is now the product of those three bioengineered baby gremlin-bats being blasted with radiation . Clearly , GvKG is interested only in presenting its own story using the creatures of the Godzilla franchise.Absurdities pervade the rest of the film as well . One of the silliest elements of the movie is M-11 , an android belonging to the Futurians . The robot 's facial expressions and mannerisms are so lame he makes Star Trek : The Next Generations 's Data look like Samuel L. Jackson . As a machine , M-11 has super strength and super speed , but the special effects used to demonstrate such abilities look unbelievably stupid . To portray the robot 's speed , the special effects department employs various techniques , all in aesthetically failed ways . Sometimes they superimpose shots of the actor running slowly over a background that is passing quickly , creating the effect that M-11 is gliding or skating through the environment . At other times they speed up the film when he is meant to be moving quickly , creating the feel of a silent-era screwball comedy . And yet , at one point , they simply add blurred streaks behind the character to try to convince us he 's moving fast . Not once does it actually feel like the android is running at supernatural speeds.Equally laughable are other special effects and props . At one point , a screen in the Futurians ' UFO displays what is meant to be a holographic image of Godzilla but that is clearly a picture of the monster superimposed over the scene . Later , we see several laser weapons that look like Super Nintendo accessories , and when the jet-packs come out , things only get worse . The shots of characters using jet-packs are accomplished by filming the environment and ( surprise ! ) superimposing footage of them standing in front of a green-screen while wearing the device . When they are in flight , therefore , they look stiff , as if their bodies do not even acknowledge the fact that they are suspended in the air . If we thought these effects were supposed to be convincing , the movie would fail immediately.Providing a respite from the ludicrous effects , the giant monster action is straightforward and fun . We get King Ghidorah raiding Japan , Godzilla fighting King Ghidorah , and then Godzilla fighting Mecha King Ghidorah from the future . These scenes stack up to the Godzilla franchise 's best fights , and unlike too many Godzilla films , they comprise a good portion of the film -- most of the third act . When you have a three-headed dragon fighting a giant dinosaur-lizard , you do n't have to get super creative , but the creatures do pull a few unexpected tricks , like Ghidorah strangling Godzilla with one of his own snake-like necks or Godzilla severing one of Ghidorah 's heads with his atomic breath . Of course , the only thing cooler than a golden , three-headed , lightning-breathing dragon is a half-robotic , golden , three-headed , lightning-breathing dragon , complete with a Godzilla grapple hook , and that is what the film gives us in the end . Writer/director Kazuki Omori understands that though dumb characters , lame special effects , and nonsensical plots are enjoyable , the Godzilla franchise 's greatest asset is its monsters . In the end , he provides just that.It is probably for the best that not all Godzilla films take a downbeat approach to the material . If that were the case , we would have over twenty iterations of what amounts to two or three ideas , and we would be missing out on what have become some of the greatest elements of the franchise , like Mechagodzilla and Manilla . On the other hand , though , a lot of the non-serious Godzilla films we do have , like Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster and Destroy All Monsters , promise campy fun but deliver only camp . This one fulfills its promise . It is mindless , for sure , but its humor and action make up for its mindlessness .	1
Can a movie that never actually goes to Vietnam truly portray the horror and tragedy of the war ? This movie proves it can be done . Coppola 's treatment of the Old Guard during the time of upheaval that was the Vietnam era brings home the true despair that both the public and some members of the military felt during the war.This movie sports several great performances . James Caan and James Earl Jones in particular stand out . Those two along with D. B. Sweeney , Angelica Huston , Joe Desjardin , Lawrence Fishburn , Dean Stockwell and Sam Bottoms make a great & quot ; war & quot ; movie without ever showing a battle . The characters develop the story and make this movie worth not just one , but several watches.There were several great Vietnam movies that came out in the 80 's , but as much as any of them , this movie truly brought home the feelings of the time to someone who was not yet an adult during that time.This movie did not get a lot of publicity that Platoon , Full Metal Jacket and Apocolypse Now received , but it is just as powerful and entertaining as those movies.See this movie . It is very good.Now , where is the DVD ?	1
I like this movie because it was MY war , and because it shows how divided we Americans were during the war in the old Republic of Viet Nam.In my opinion , this is one of the best movies made which accurately portray that tragic and noble moment in history .	1
I never saw the movie when it came out when I was 16 and now I really see how ahead of it 's time this movie was .	1
The professional conduct of this man is how it should be . A fantastic movie . Highly recommend watching especially in our troubled times of racial discrimination and diversity of colour , creed and religion .	1
This movie is a class act . Great plot and good cast . Sidney Poitier in his heyday . Fun and poinient topic of a couple in love in changing times .	1
My two little boys love this video ! After Christmas is over , The Snowman still is great to watch all winter , and since it does n't have narration , we have fun talking about the movie .	1
To me The Snowman is a classic right up there with Charlie Brown 's Christmas . The animation is unique and mesmerizingly beautiful . `` Walking in The Air '' is about as classic and beautiful a theme you would ever want in a Christmas special . The Snowman has become part of our yearly Christmas tradition in our family . Our children love it.The second feature on this disk I found unfunny and hard to sit through . It 's a throwaway to me . This DVD gets five stars just for The Snowman .	1
This is truely one of the best & quot ; movies & quot ; I have ever seen . We got the VHS years ago when our daughter was very young and more recently got the DVD . The music is haunting and beautiful . I loved it as much as my daughter and we would watch it over and over . Ca n't say anything about Father Christmas as I do n't remember it . We still watch The Snowman regularly after all these years and are getting copies for our grandchildren for this Christmas . Enjoy !	1
As a Movie Fan , I can Understand people Hating this movie , as a Male , I ca n't understand it . It is just Too Much Fun to Dislike , and we get Many a good Cleavage shot of The Lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt , plus a lot of Violent Deaths ... Sweet.But , as I consider myself a Real Movie Critic first and a Male second , I 'll review it Like a real critic would ... I Really , Really Love Jennifer Love.. Do n't You.But Seriously , It does n't really have much going for it , Jennifer and Deaths aside . No one else in the cast make a Lasting Impression , except of course Horror Favourite Jeffrey Combs as the Hotel Manager . He is Always a Creepy Character , and he has a few Witty lines . Jack Black and Mecki Phiffer are Totally wasted on Characters who do n't suit their Acting Abilities . Brandy really should stick to singing , as her acting skills are far from Polished.Danny Cannon 's Direction is Above Average , he never misses an opportunity to Zoom in on a Mutilated Corpse , ( or , as I mentioned earlier , the lovely Jennifer ) He is a Better Director than this Material allows him to be , but he does all he can do with it and that 's all anyone can ask of him . He did n't write the Script .	1
I Still Know What You Did Last SummerScore : 67/100As much as I really wanted to dislike I Still Know What You Did Last Summer , I , unfortunately , could n't . This film has very bad reviews and did n't do excellently at the box office , but it is n't , surprisingly , as bad as it is supposed to be . It 's not the teen-kill movie for everyone , but it held my interest , and is a pretty solid modern horror movie.Two years after the horrible incident , Julie James ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ) is back in college and is worse than ever having dreams about Ben Willis , the man who killed all her friends a couple of years ago . She gets comfort from a new friend named Will ( Matthew Settle ) . Julie 's other friend Karla ( Brandy ) tries to hook the two of them up and when she wins a trip to the Bahamas , she knows that it is perfect . But Ray ( Freddie Prinze Jr. ) is still in the picture and Julie only goes as friends . Karla , her boyfriend Tyrell , Julie , and Will take flight right before Ray encounters the fisherman again . He tries to tell Julie not to leave but it is too late . Now in the Bahamas Julie is starting to lighten up and have fun . Then suddenly things start going terribly wrong when a storm hits the Island and people start to disappear . Ray takes a boat to the Island to warn Julie but will he make it on time to save Julie again from the fisherman ? It 's all predictable and quite dumb , but if you do n't look for a dazzlingly original story and a pitch-perfect script then I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is great fun . Jennifer Love Hewitt is a nice heroine , she is continuously good to look at , and the set decoration is nice , although I found it odd that it was set on a Bahamian island and was shot in Mexico . Still , there is heaps of eye candy in many scenes and there are no breaks from the gore , which is great for teenagers , although the film was a tad too graphic for my liking . The only absolutely major quibble was the editing . Half the time it looked like the actors mimed the words and then put them onto a speaker phone after the shooting , and it looked terribly messy and was a largely irritating flaw . But , do n't worry about that too much , just sit back and let this film do what it was made to do - entertain.I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is far , far away from perfect , but both as a silly slasher flick and a stupidly entertaining brew , it works quite admirably .	1
even if you have seen this film and think it is quite rubbish then . your probably wrong because to fully understand all the hard clues takes at least two or three times to understand this , the first five minutes of this film is pretty rubbish , straight from their it gets quite good it 's about four teenagers who are drunk and is driving a pretty expensive bmw end up running over him , thinking that he 's dead they decide to dump his body in a sea , around the same time some ordinary man sucides into the water , weeks later when it comes up on the news that a dead body was found in the sea , the four teenagers think it 's him , but it is n't and the man they ran over know who they are and decides after a year to haunt them down 1 by 1 he decides to kill them the same day he got ran over but first he has to toy with thim and to show them who 's boss.for a small 10 dollars it 's definatly worth it .	1
Who cares what this movie is about , Jennifer Love Hewitt is running around in a tight wet shirt ! The only bad part is that they killed off Buffy The Vampire Slayer in part one . Get the directors cut version , for the more & quot ; Extreme & quot ; footage . Get this movie or I will gut you with my hook ... I am the greatest ...	1
This is a great cyber thriller and Sandra Bullock does an excellent job portraying a female computer geek . The directing , casting , sets , and music are first class . Those of us that are in the computer industry and those who are not will both enjoy it . I 'm a Senior Engineer that has worked with computers for twenty plus years and I saw it when it was first released.When I first saw this movie , only one thing amused me , the Wolfenstein game , it 's the movies only shortcoming . At the time the movie was released the game was old news and they carry on about how the game is state of the art . It did n't ring true with those of us that were on the bleeding edge of the gaming community . They should not have put the game in or came up with something that looked high tech since the game dates it . Perhaps snobbery , but true nonetheless.As I said before it was the only shortcoming . This movie is excellent and the mood is like a Hitchcockian or Grisham thriller . Well paced and it keeps you guessing what 's next . The threat of identity theft and large computer companies failing because of faulty software today only shows how in that respect the movie was ahead of it 's time . I never tire of watching it . The DVD quality is good , but unfortunately it does not include any extras . Still well worth buying a copy .	1
The suspense is very good in this film . There is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it.The story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way , making it an involving movie for the viewer . That 's why I give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved in it . Sandra Bullock is more cute than annoying , which she normally is to me , so this is my highest-rated movie with her in it.It is a typical Bullock movie in which she plays a mousy ( but profane ) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero . Sound familiar ? There also are plenty of holes in this story and certain things just do n't add up but overall it is a very entertaining film and definitely recommended .	1
I love Sandra Bullock , so of course to me this movie is worth watching just to see her act . But I also liked the movie based on the suspense . But having said that , did you see the huge cell phones back in 1995 ? I forgot how big they were . It just shocked me to see how advanced technology got in 10/15 years . I love it .	1
Considering how much computers are in our lives these days , I have seen relatively few movies about computer programmers . Angela Bennett ( Sandra Bullock ) , who is a systems analyst living in California , is sent a disk with some secret information on that Angela can make nothing of except that it says it 's secret . A pi symbol on the corner of the screen of this program lets her access a whole lot of secret files . Her colleague , Dale Hessman ( Ray McKinnon ) , who sent it to her is killed in his light aircraft as he flies down to meet her . Bennett was on the point of going on vacation , so she continues on down to Mexico where she learns of Hessman 's death . Meanwhile , she gets picked up on the beach by Jack Devlin ( Jeremy Northam ) who takes her out on his boat , seduces her and then tries to kill her . One of the first difficulties that Bennett encounters is that she has her identity stolen and a new ` Angela Bennett ' installed in the firm for which she works . She has to assume a new identity of 'Ruth Marx ' even to get back into the U.S. from Mexico . The rest of the film is then about Bennett trying to get her own identity back and get crucial information to the FBI while Devlin tries to stop her . The perpetrator of this scheme is the head of an organization that is supposed to be protecting hacking of secret government files . This is a very exciting , nail-biting thriller	1
Sandra Bullocks , plays a shy computer geek , that gets tangled up with the wrong crowd . Trying to get her name back , after she had her ID stolen . Very good movie .	1
Not exactly designed to be reassuring about computers and technology , the film 's premise is that a hacker group has infiltrated the nation 's computer systems and is behind major terrorist attacks . Sandra Bullock is excellent as a computer expert who is unwittingly helping the bad guys until she finds out what is going on ... .and then she 's on the run for her life as the terrorists try to get to her before she exposes them . While I think Sandra Bullock is at the top of her form in this one , I think Jeremy Northam has n't gotten nearly enough credit for his role as Devlin , the romantic stranger/hacker/bad guy . You 'll get a kick out of Dennis Miller , too , as Bullock 's ex-boyfriend who nearly comes to her rescue . I have only one quibble about this film . If you pay attention to Bullock 's mannerisms , you 'll notice that there 's rarely a scene where she is n't fiddling with or playing with her hair- tucking it behind her ears , pulling it back in a pretend ponytail , brushing a strand off her forehead . What is THAT all about anyway ? I felt like saying , & quot ; Get a haircut already ! & quot ;	1
Though the incorrect interpretation of technology will no doubt annoy those in the know , the movie functions well as a suspense-thriller , technological or otherwise . Interesting is the expert direction shown where the movie becomes quite hopeless somewhere around the middle . After Dennis Miller 's character dies , the movie becomes quiet and the pace slows . Bullock is arrested , no one believes her story , and after a well-done scene where she talks to her Alzheimer's-suffering mother on the phone in prison , the movie goes back to the thriller motif . It was after this bit that I became convinced that this is a really good movie . It 's not trying to reinvent the wheel or deliver some message ( though it apparently did n't hurt to pretend so in order to boost ticket sales ) , but it is interesting , has a good cast , and features a few nail-biting scenes that only a talented production could pull off .	1
The Net sheds light ( as it should do ) on the reality of people having grown so dependent on technology that someone tampering with one 's data or an unintended error for that matter could lead to a nightmare.The film brings to the screen the story of Angela Bennett , a computer expert , who after receiving a disc with sensitive information falls victim to a cover up with herself being the one who is being covered up ... Sandra Bullock and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.The setting , the plot , and the dialogues are all wonderful ! In short , The Net is a movie definitely worth watching , as it will surely provide for an evening 's entertainment .	1
This could actually happen to someone , which makes it scary . It 's a good story , lots of mystery and excitement , good characters .	1
Another great computer classic ! A good story line & good acting . I would recommend this movie to any audience ! The Net will keep you guessing & wondering what it would be like if this sort of thing did really happen .	1
Fabulous movie . Regradless of whether or not you are a Sandra Bullock fan , this is classic , wholsome thriller stuff . If you are a Sandra Bullock fan , you 'll appreciate it even more .	1
Gene Wilder and the late Richard Pryor are hilarious in this film , coming to California from New York to promote a business of theirs . They end up in jail because they were suspected of an armed bank robbery . At the bank , dressed in chicken costumes , the pair do a little dance . They remove the costumes , the real crooks themselves don them and hold up the newly-opened bank that Skip ( Pryor ) and Harry ( Wilder ) were promoting . Sidney Poitier , the star of 1967 's GUESS WHO 'S COMING TO DINNER ? ,1988 's SHOOT TO KILL and some others , does a wonderful directing job . One of the best films of winter 1980-81 . Previously , Pryor and Wilder together filmed 1976 's SILVER STREAK , and following SC,1989 's SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL and 1991 's ANOTHER YOU ( the latter was each Pryor 's and Wilder 's very last film ) . Sadly , the good Lord took away Peoria , Illinois-born Pryor in 2005 . Wilder , widower of Saturday Night Live comedienne Gilda Radner , since retiring from show business has successfully battled cancer . Although now cancer-free , Wilder remains retired .	1
Just as described and quick delivery and of course the movie is great . A must see for all Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor fans . They only did two good movies , this one and Silver Streak . Catch them both for side splitting laughs	1
A golden oldie from 1980 . Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor are two well knowed actors in the Netherlands . Stir Crazy , Silver streak express , Brewster 's millions etc have lots of reruns on our channels . We like this kind of humor . They can act so brilliant even if you know what is going to happen next . I would say a classic humor movie .	1
Of course , EVERYBODY -- - and their mothers -- - have seen this movie , and CONTRARY to what ONE reviewer found '' unbelievable '' , our United States ' Prison System REALLY DID have `` convict rodeos '' I mean , a bull-goring -- -or being TRAMPLED [ to death ] -- - meant very little to a `` lifer '' , think about it ! DO N'T think TOO much about this `` farce '' . A farce , by definition , is an impossible situation with an unlikelyoutcome . THAT pretty much described ANY `` screwball comedy '' from the 'thirties ... right up till today ! Believable : no ! Enjoyable ? : Hell yes ! The newly re-mastered Blu-ray disc is a work of love by whomever completed the task .	1
Gene Wilder and Richard Prior has tapped this comedy to the funniest ! It is hilarious from beginning to end ! Do n't miss the convict that sings in his cell ! His voice is amazing !	1
Have always loved this movie . Kind of follows the path that Elvis had coming into his own . Great stars and music .	1
This movie is by far the best adaption of & quot ; Bye Bye Birdie & quot ; you will ever see ! Nothing beats out Ann-Margret belting out the title song in the opening and closing credits ! This movie will make you feel good all over . Guarenteed . : o )	1
What can I say ? I like this movie . Always have . My wife hates it . Nice take on the Elvis myth . And what is the matter with kids today ?	1
From the opening scenes to the end , this is a fast moving farce that is really a fun movie , great musical with music you have heard throughout your life , but probably never knew where from.Whats the Matter with Kids Today - what a rip with Paul Lynde with his high pitched voice singing with Dick Van Dyke and Maureen Stapleton . Also , 'Put on a Happy Face ' I am sure most alive today have heard that song . One of my favorites is 'Got a Lot of Living to do ' . Fast moving with a dance called the 'Birdie . 'Anne Margeret plays the main character , Kim , who is going to get the last kiss before Conrad Birdie ( an Elvis type figure ) , leaves for the Army . Interesting that she plays across from Elvis in Viva Las Vegas later in her life . Kim is dating Hugo ( Bobby Rydell ) . Rydell was a teen idol of sorts of his day and had hits in his life namely , 'Wild One . ' Rydell is so very jealous , but yet a goofy teen who has to decide to stand by and let her get that one last kiss or to do something else , but what ? Janet Leigh , of Psycho fame plays a big part in the movie . ( She is the mother of Jamie Lee Curtis . ) Leigh was quite famous in her day and Birdie was a welcome up tick after her fame with Psycho.The cool thing about this movie is there is not one relationship involved in the plot there are two . Kim and Hugo and Albert and Rosie ( van Dyke and Leigh ) . Juxtaposed against each other , you see that age has nothing to do with romantic difficulty and confusion.This is one of the fun movies of the '60s , relatively clean fun , a few areas that may have been touchy at the time , but it was just before the hippy era that changed our world . There are few things to watch for , this movie was done in the summer before JFK 's assassination , he is mentioned in the movie or referred to 'the President says we should drink more milk ... ' and something interesting is shown . Toward the end we see the Russians , a rather large orchestra and you see the man in charge of orchestra hitting himself in the head with his shoe , ala Kruschev doing the same at the UN.Also , the scene with Birdie being on 'Ed Sullivan ' predates the appearance of the Beattles on that same show , and , the girls go wild with the Beattles as they did with Birdie in the movie , who would have thought the genius in predicting that behavior ? There is so much to this movie . Fun cast , great music , seriously funny interplay of characters and story . One last comment , the scene where Birdie is introduced in the town is classic , he goes around the square singing with gusto , if you look closely you will notice it is the same set where square used in 'Back to the Future . 'Bye Bye Birdie is a must for any family DVD/HiDef Library .	1
I actually played `` Kim '' in my middle schools rendition of Bye Bye birdie , and since then , this has been my absolute favorite musical of all time - I 'm sure this is partly due to my great memories of being in this play , but regardless of that , the songs are great and I love the story line.Bye Bye Birdie is about an Elvis-type guy who has just got word that he 's being drafted into the army . Because of his popularity as a singer , they decide to run a contest where 1 lucky girl will be chosen to have `` one last kiss '' with him . Kim wins the contest , and will be given her kiss live on the Ed Sulliven Show ( a show that was really popular in the 1950 's ) .Much of the story surrounds the excitement about Kim winning the contest & the fact that her father and boyfriend do n't want the kiss to happen . Will they be able to stop it ? Then there 's `` Albert '' played by Dick Van Dyke - an on & off again songwriter , and his girlfriend `` Rosie '' who wants nothing more than for Albert to propose to her . Unfortunately , Albert is such a `` mommas boy '' that he ca n't seem to make any decisions for himself , and his mother is not about to suggest that he get married and leave her all alone ! Will he ever step up and pop the question ? Overall , I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals . It will remind you of a much simpler time - with the music and outfits in classic 1950 's style . A great movie for `` family night '' !	1
Why is the Blu Ray version so expensive ? Why do they make a DVD with cover art that does not even appear in the film ? Also Ann Margrets final shot in the end is cut off ! This was a great musical of the 60 's with great performances and songs and the current packaging makes it look like a B film ! cOLUMBIA PICTURES , get it together !	1
At the time Elvis was drafted the teen-aged world went into a panic . How could the US draft their hero ? This movie is based on a stage play that was written to make fun of the uproar and furor caused by Elvis going into the Army . Starring Dick Van Dyke ( who also starred in the play ) Janet Leigh ( mis-cast since she does n't sing all that well ) , Ann-Margaret , Paul Lynde and a lot of other greats , the movie is funny , tuneful and very enjoyable . Packed with songs like `` Put On A Happy Face '' and `` Kids '' it will keep you humming for days . Enjoy .	1
Look ... let me cut right to the chase on this film.It 's an ignored classic.Why ... ? ... I do not know.I even looked up Lee Marvin under Ask Jeeves and there was a Bio ... very detailed ... that I pulled up that did not even mention this film.I think it to be Marvin 's best.Yes ... better that the Dirty Dozen which has become a Mantra title for some Marvin fans.The performances of Marvin and Lancaster are impeccable and charged with a timeless charisma that is also exhibited by Woody Strode and Robert Ryan as well.I have seen this movie now several times now and could sit down and watch it again and still enjoy it.Everything about this movie works at just the right time and in just the right way.This is one of the great films to ever come out of the 1960 's and certainly a & quot ; have to own & quot ; item for any Lancaster , Marvin , Strode or Ryan fan.Oddly ... few people , who love westerns , admire Marvin , Lancaster , Strode or Ryan ... have ever heard of it.Pass the word ... ..	1
`` The Professionals '' is the last of an era of Westerns . It has a an intelligent well written script , well directed by Richard Brooks . What a cast Burt Lancaster and Lee Marvin are both excellent as the aging mercenaries out for one last mission . Great supporting cast.My only regret is I wish Woody Stode would have had a little more of a role . Unlike other films of the time and genre the characters are honest heros , not antiheros . These are honorable men doing a tough dangerous job .	1
Sandwiched in between the final genre explorations of John Ford and the more hard-hitting and violent styles personified by Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone , THE PROFESSIONALS is one of the best and , in some ways , one of the most underrated Westerns of the 1960s . And while its plot and setting -- mercenaries in the middle of a Mexican revolution out on what appears to be something of a suicide mission -- may not be anything new ( both VERACRUZ and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN do precede it ) , it is certainly done with a lot of panache , style , sharp dialogue , and a good dose of action for its nearly two-hour running time.Based on Frank O'Rourke 's novel `` A Mule For The Marquesa '' , THE PROFESSIONALS stars four great actors -- Burt Lancaster ; Lee Marvin ; Robert Ryan ; and Woody Strode -- as four highly skilled mercenaries who are hired on by a railroad tycoon ( Ralph Bellamy ) to rescue his wife ( Claudia Cardinale ) from the hands of a Mexican bandit ( Jack Palance ) who has taken her across the border into Mexico . The deal is for these `` professionals '' to get paid $ 10,000 , although Palance is demanding $ 100,000 from Bellamy . The four men are very expert at what they do : Marvin himself was well-acquainted with Palance , having fought alongside him in the early years of the revolution ; Lancaster is a munitions genius ; Ryan handles the horse-wrangling assignments ; and Strode applies his trade at weaponry , both firearms and archery . As they make their way towards the hideout where Palance and his well-armed militia , plus Cardinale , are holed up , they often wax philosophically on the mission they 're on , their lives , and the coming end of the era of professionals like them.In an explosive sequence , they decimate Palance 's hideout and force Cardinale to come with them , all the while knowing that Palance and his gang will be coming after them . But the twist comes in them learning that in fact Cardinale was once Palance 's wife ; both of them were heavily involved in the revolution , even though that revolution is now dying out ; and that it was in fact Bellamy who stole Cardinale from Palance in the first place.Although not necessarily known for being a Western director , writer/director Richard Brooks , who directed Lancaster in the Oscar-winning performance he gave in 1960 's ELMER GANTRY , managed to make a consistently interesting entry into the genre here . He was certainly cognizant of how the genre was changing as the 1960s progressed , and knew not only of Ford 's traditionalist methods , but also the more unconventional ones being parlayed by Leone and Peckinpah . It also helped that he knew how to stage action scenes that were consistently motivated by character ( a trait that Peckinpah would echo , though it would too often and too unfairly be obscured by the violence of that director 's films ) , and that he had four great actors in them . Marvin , often known for playing tough guys and heavies ( such as the titular character of Ford 's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE ) ; Lancaster ; Ryan ( who never gave a bad performance in his often-underrated career ) , and Strode ( who also starred in LIBERTY VALANCE , and as the title character of Ford 's SERGEANT RUTLEDGE ) acquaint themselves quite well under Brooks ' concise direction ; and even Palance does a good turn as the Mexican bandit . Cardinale , in only her second American film ( after 1964 's THE PINK PANTHER ) is also quite convincing as the Mexican-born damsel in distress.Filmed primarily on location in the Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada and portions of Death Valley National Monument in California , THE PROFESSIONALS is topped off by the fairly authentic south-of-the-border score by Maurice Jarre , and Conrad Hall 's fabulous wide screen cinematography . It is a film worthy of seeing again , and worthy of a revival as proof to 21st century film audiences that the Western is still a legitimate film form for our time , and for all time .	1
This is a very likable movie..the kind that is n't made much anymore . Filmed around the time of Pekinpah 's 'Wild Bunch ' , this is a very much overlooked Richard Brooks classic . The premise of course is simple..hire four professionals to rescue wealthy JW Grant 's ( Ralph Bellamy ) wife ( Claudia Cardinale ) from the revolutionary Raza ( Jack Palance ) . The bold quick strike is n't as simple as planned . Along the way there are dangers and luring detours . From the burning by day/freezing by night conditions , nothing truly is harmless in this desert.The dialogue between Rico ( Lee Marvin ) , and Dolworth ( Burt Lancaster ) , makes this movie a memorable one . Here are two old war weary buddies that have been through many campaigns . Together they are going for more money than they ever made in all their crazy wildcat days . There is also a great discussion between Raza and Dolworth on the meaning of the 'great love affair ' revolution , as they both contemplate the reasons for being in this..'dirty business'.I saw this movie in the theatre on first release and enjoyed it so much that I bought the VHS and then the DVD . This is just a great movie well worth adding to any western collection .	1
A good broad-scope western in the & # 34 ; Seven Samurai & # 34 ; tradition . A group of warriors are recruited to rescue a rich man 's wife from Juarista badits way out in the desert . The comic book characters are interesting and well played . Lots of action and good production values . If you liked The Magnificent Seven , you 'll like this one .	1
This story is a little different slant on the life and morals of a group of 'guns for hire . ' It definitely nevergot boring or predictable . Seeing this group of actors work together is alone worth the price . Classicmovie lovers , western lovers , almost everyone will enjoy this movie . The quality of the DVD is excellentalso .	1
If you are suffering from low testosterone levels this movie could help . Burt Lancaster , Lee Marvin , Robert Ryan , Woody Strode , Jack Palance , Ralph Bellamy & hot Claudia Cardinale . WOW ! A great musical score this movie won 3 Oscars . Think about it . A western wins 3 Academy Awards ? Got ta be great .	1
Great western flim , classic story and great actors in the film too.a must have for your collection . I like it .	1
The Professionals is a very entertaining western that does not receive the same hype as many other westerns made during the same time period . It is an excellent story with an even better cast . The story is about the efforts of four men to rescue a railroad tycoon 's wife from the Mexican revolutionaries she was kidnapped by . They must travel deep into Mexico to rescue her battling bandits , the weather , and themselves all the way . The film is very good at dealing with the friendships between the men as the time and the land changes much as the Wild Bunch or Butch Cassidy/Sundance Kid did . How can these men change their lives as the world around them changes ? The movie blends plenty of great dialogue with a ton of quotable lines , a lively score from Maurice Jarre , and great acting all-around . Ca n't miss western and highly recommended.Burt Lancaster gives another excellent performance as Bill Dolworth , the explosives expert , Lee Marvin stars as Rico Fardan , the leader of the men and also a munitions expert , Robert Ryan plays Hans Ehrengard , the horse wrangler who cares so much for his horses , and Woody Strode gives an excellent supporting performance as Jacob Sharp , the adept tracker who dispatches his enemy with bow and arrow . All four give great performances . How could you go wrong with such a cast ? Jack Palance is very good as Raza , the leader of the revolutionaries/bandits who has a past with . Ralph Bellamy plays the husband who desperately wants his wife back , played by Claudia Cardinale who looks beautiful . The new Special Edition DVD includes three excellent featurettes , `` The Professionals : A Classic , '' `` Burt Lancaster : A Portrait , '' and `` Memories from the Professionals '' which includes interviews with Claudia Cardinale , widescreen presentation , and a theatrical trailer . Check out this western if you have n't seen it before ! The Professionals is an excellent , action-packed western with a perfect twist at the end , quick snappy dialogue , and a great cast . Do not miss ! Also , if you like the movie check out the novel by Frank O'Rourke , also called a Mule for the Marquesa .	1
Four Iron Eagle movies were made . This is by far the best . Often true of any series of movies , the first is so good it inspires sequels . I saw this movie during its first release . It was great then and it is still fun today . Surprisingly the aircraft are still used today and so it seems timely even now when you consider what is happening in Iraq . Filmed during Ronald Reagan 's administration it is interesting how this could apply even today . All in all a stand out movie that is still fun to watch today . This is one most the family will enjoy.A high school graduate finds that his father has been shot down over a Middle Eastern country and is being held hostage . He has three days to rescue him before he will be hanged . He enlists the aid of his fellow flying club friends and a retired Air Force Colonel to concoct a plan to fly over and rescue his father . Good acting , great flying sequences , and excellent music soundtrack make this worth catching . I love the soundtrack , especially his flying song by Queen . Good quality DVD with little in the way of extras . Still worth adding to your collection of family action movies .	1
my husband wanted this again since he dropped his and broke it . did n't take long to get another . shipper was quick and prompt .	1
This is really a great action movie and has great actors in it came in really quickly and in good shape	1
Iron Eagle has always been one of my favorite movies . If you are looking for a movie with a lot of blood and gore , you will not find it here . What you will find is a lot of action and great flying scenes	1
GREAT FOR MY COLLECTION I LOVE IT ... 100 %	1
yes i might be a little crazy to compare orlando to the greek figure tiresias but i have to be honest . orlando is virginia wolfes verison of tiresias in some form . i love this movie and the actors that performed their parts . the music is good and the time jump from elizabeth the first to the modern day is well done . i recommed this gender-bending movie , because its spell casting and the story of searching for your own happiness is that good too .	1
A genderbending film that pays its respect to Virgina Woolf 's original work . Sensually witty and highly enjoyable ! English author , essayist , publisher Virginia Woolf , was a key figure in modernist literature . As a woman who was inspired by avante garde which influenced her original work , she was a woman who was not only intellectual but a woman who was an individual that walked the beat of her own drum . From being married to a man and having an affair with aristocrat and English author/poet Vita Sackville-West.In 1928 , Virginia Woolf wrote a semi-biographical novel based on the life of Vita titled `` Orlando '' . One of Woolf 's most accessible novels and eventually a novel that would receive its film adaptation in 2008 courtesy of writer/director Sally Potter ( `` The Tango Lesson '' , `` The London Story '' , `` The Gold Diggers '' ) . The film would go on to receive a 1992 Academy Award nomination for Costume Design and Production Design.VIDEO : '' Orlando '' is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen . For a 1992 film , the latest DVD release for `` Orlando '' is not a huge improvement over its 1999 DVD release . I know one of the problems that some people had with the original release was the amount of spotting and that the colors look a bit muted.I personally have n't seen the 1999 DVD release but with this 2010 DVD release , colors such as reds , browns and blacks are more pronounced . There are some parts where colors do look muted and some areas looking a bit faded . But I would imagine it 's due to the film stock used around that time . The film does manage to contain a god amount of grain but also has its share of low-light noise . I did see some occasional dust while viewing but it was not plentiful . Also , because there are a good number of lengthy special features included with the film on one DVD , I imagine that there would have to be some compromising in terms of picture quality.But as for the difference between the two DVD releases when it comes to picture quality , although I have n't seen the 1993 DVD , with DVD authoring having changed so much in the last decade that I feel confident that this 2010 DVD release of `` Orlando '' is much better than the previous DVD release nearly eleven years ago.I will say that with Sony Pictures Classics usually doing simultaneous releases for Blu-ray and DVD , I am surprised that `` Orlando '' is only being given a DVD release , because this is one film I would have loved to see an HD upgrade.AUDIO : '' Orlando '' is presented in English Dolby Surround . The film is primarily center and front channel driven and for the most part , is mostly all dialogue . There is a scene in which Orlando goes through a field where bombs are exploding and that is probably the major extent of action-based sequences . But for the most part , dialogue is clear and the music and ambiance sounds do come clear through the front channels but I do n't really recall the surround channels or LFE being utilized all that much.Subtitles are in English and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES : '' Orlando '' comes with the following special features : * Select Scenes Commentary with Director Sally Potter - ( 10:17 ) Writer/Director Sally Potter does commentary for select scenes from the film . The audio commentary is more like an interview with Sally Potter who explains why she made `` Orlando '' into a film . * Orlando Goes to Russia - ( 32:57 ) A documentary featuring Sally Potter going to Russia to film the 1610 time period for `` Orlando '' . This featurette is a video diary of producer Christopher Sheppard documenting Sally Potter and producers wanting to film in Russia and how the negotiations took place during the time of when Russia had just allowed film companies to start filming in their country and the two years of research and rounds of negotiations in trying to get parts of the film shot in Russia and the challenges the film crew had in trying to get the film shot in Russia . * Orlando in Uzbekistan - ( 51:53 ) A featurette about shooting in Uzbekistan and the challenges that arose during the filming in Uzbekistan and the expectancy of any Western company coming into the country to shoot a film is loaded with a lot of money and thus , people abandoning the country and wanting to renegotiate for more money from the producers and thus halting the film production . * Jimmy Was An Angel - ( 8:03 ) A featurette about a singer Jimmy Sommerville ( of Bronski Beat and the Communards ) who played an angel in the film `` Orlando '' and a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of that scene . * Venice Film Festival Press Conference - ( 23:08 ) Featuring the press conference that took place after the screening of `` Orlando '' at the `` Venice International Film Festival 1992 ' . * An Interview with Sally Potter - ( 13:21 ) Featuring an interview with Sally Potter at the `` Venice International Film Festival 1992 ' .

Immortality . The chance to experience life differently and how the experience is everchanging.Virginia Woolf 's `` Orlando '' , a semi-biographical novel based on Vita Sackville-West , the woman that Woolf was intimate with , is truly a unique cinema experience and an interesting look at the treatment of women and their position in society during that era.Although written in a way in which many people at the time were unaware that this book was a semi-biography , I tend to look at this film ( as based on the novel ) as a story that is quite liberating . And similar to how Orlando is shown through different time periods , I often wonder how people have perceived Woolf 's most accessible novel during the various decades , especially the changes in how women are treated in business , politics and society but also to see how people perceived the character of Orlando and having had to experience life as a man and a woman and thus reading a book that does deal with sexual tendencies.I believe that Woolf who wrote the story in 1928 as a love letter to Vita broke new boundaries as a modernist but also in crafting a story that is fiction/non-fiction and writing without any constraints.All this is quite intriguing and to see how the very passionate writer/director Sally Potter giving great care in the adaptation of the novel and being persistent in trying to capture that feel and look by traveling to different countries and doing the necessary research in several years and making it happen . Again , I have n't read the original book but having read reviews of people who have and feeling that Woolf did a remarkable job in her screenplay should show you how dedicated Potter and her producers were in bringing `` Orlando '' to life.Let me first tell you how remarkable actress Tilda Swinton was in this film . To play an androgynous man and later a woman who experiences a lifetime of changes due to her immortality but to keep this straight face on and yet able to quickly deliver these humorous one-liners and seeing her react to the various characters around her was quite entertaining . Billy Zane did a great job playing Shelmerdine and although short roles , Quentin Crisp as Queen Ellizabeth I and Jimmy Sommerville as an angel were well-done and brought a not-so-serious but subtle yet farcical feel to the overall film.As previously mentioned , I did n't own the 1999 DVD of `` Orlando '' but for those who have been wanting this film on DVD , you get a good number of special features included . I definitely respected Sally Potters determination in making this film after watching these featurettes and knowing the challenges she and the producers had faced in filming in Russia and Uzbekistan . There is a good amount of lengthy features included , the 2010 special edition DVD release has over 2 hours of never-before-seen extra footage ( comparing to the 1999 DVD release , I see that four special features were included in the 1999 release but have a shorter duration than what is presented in the 2010 version ) .Overall , `` Orlando '' was an enjoyable film and I can see how anyone watching this film would see the incredible potential of actress Tilda Swinton . Many have criticized the actress of her role as a man as unbelievable . But my focus was not on the portrayal of man but the evolution of a person who has been both man and woman and trying to adjust to the changes that Orlando must face in a variety of time periods to the person 's own immortality.The film captures your attention due to the detail that went into the costume and production design but its the witty one liners that come out of Orlando 's mouth that I found humorous . But it 's the political satire of the film that I find most intriguing and Sally Potter did a great job in capturing that in her film . `` Orlando '' is a film that is entertaining , humorous and truly captivating . Definitely recommended .	1
We began watching this video , but stopped it a short way into it when we realized this was not what we had hoped for . It was too contrived and predictable .	-1
The DVD transfer is pretty good but the scene with Yukon discovering peppermint has been cut.It seems pretty odd to sell a DVD as a restored classic only to leave out the main thing that was to be restored !	-1
I must agree with the other reviewers that this set is awful as it does no show the episodes in the original clifhanger form as shown on TV . I will be the first in line to buy underdog when it is produced as it was ORIGINALLY shown with all the shorts like tennessee tuxedo and commander mcbragg and with the cliffhangers . Come on guys give us the original show as it should be and this set will fly off the shelves . Until then you can keep this junk .	-1
The title of the product gives the impression that the contents will be the complete series of Underdog . Afterall , is that not what the collector would want ? However , all in all , it is about 11 episodes , which is sadly disappointing.There is no continuity between the episodes , no obvious reason for the grouping , nothing but a quick assembly and package job in hopes of suckering an old fan into buying just a piece of what he really wants.As has been stated here , there are none of the `` cliffhanger '' episodes , which is both a plus and a minus . The little cartoons were most enjoyable , and the handful we are given is a sad sampling and a sorry excuse . However , on the other hand , it is nice to be able to watch an entire episode of Underdog without being interrupted.But again , beware of this product , as it is nothing more than a tease . I suggest not buying it now , but rather waiting until the whole series is released on DVD , to save having to pay for the same thing twice .	-1
This is the worst movie NOT about Jesus ever made ! Instead of making a film about Christ 's life and/or his message , Mel Gibson makes a slasher flick about what the government can do to another human being . If you are a twisted person who enjoys watching over 2 hours of obsessive blood & torture , then you will love this absurd gore-fest . Otherwise , it 's an obscene , narrowly focused , remote , spiritually uninvolving , and amateurishwaste of time . The acting is average and there is an anti-Semitic message simmering at the surface of this mess . Even Satan is portrayed as a cliche -- -an ambisexual hooded figure lurking in the background of several scenes . There is nothing new here except that all of the actors speak in Aramaic , which is distracting since you must read subtitles . The slow motion scenes are so self-conscious that the film becomes tedious to watch after awhile . Plus , there are historical inaccuracies contained within , like the fact that Romans did not nail spikes into Jesus ' hands but his wrists . Overall , this movie told me next-to-nothing about the man called Jesus of Nazareth . The only vaguely interesting part of the film was the music , which reminded of the excellent music from `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' composed by Peter Gabriel . ( The CD is titled `` Passion '' . ) In fact , if you want to watch a deeply moving , spiritual film , rent or buy `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' , which was a gritty , realistic interpretation of Jesus ' life , and contained a rare look at the human side of Jesus . ( It seemed to me that Gibson was influenced by this movie and decided to do his own version but failed miserably . )	-1
I finally saw this film after everyone has said all that can be said about it , so I 'll be brief . Expecting the absolute worst from Mr. Mel `` Sadist '' Gibson , I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as its idolatrous fan base would have you believe , but neither is it as repellent as its detractors claim . In short , it 's just a movie , not a particularly good one , with absolutely no emotional content and nothing in it to either explain what 's happening or to make you care . It looks terrific -- -Mel obviously has cash to spare for his film-director-as-God craziness . But that 's about where the praise ends . The whole thing has a nasty tone ; in Mel 's version of the tale , anyone who had anything to do with Jesus suffers nothing but misery , and while I 'm not a believer myself , my guess is that 's not the moral of the story as Jesus would tell it . And when Jesus marches out of the tomb at the end , eyes a-blazin ' and military music blasting away on the soundtrack , I forgot for a second whether I was watching a film about Jesus or whether I had accidentally stumbled on to `` Braveheart Part II . '' Mel Gibson is a wretched director , and the worst thing anyone can do with wretched directors is to take their work too seriously , for that gives them clout they do n't deserve . All he 's done here is turn a Biblical story into a horror movie , complete with creepy Satan babies and more shredded flesh than is on display in the entire `` Friday the 13th '' series . This stuff was camp 30 years ago , and it 's just sad to see Gibson resorting to schlock effects in an attempt to make up for his movie 's complete lack of narrative grounding . See this or do n't see this , whichever is your preference . But religious or not , this film is not going to change your life . If it does , then you need to get a different one.Grade : D+	-1
I came at this film from a non-Christian perspective in that I think the events portrayed either never happened or were so distorted by those who wrote the Gospels that they beared no resemblance to history . That meant I could n't respond to the guilt trip Mel Gibson meant to put on everyone about how Jesus suffered for everyone 's sins , so I looked at it as just a movie . A very boring movie.First the good parts . I thought using the ancient languages worked very well as did the look of the film , which featured some good filter effects ( the garden scenes ) and a drab color palette that evoked the past more than a bright one would have . I also liked Maia Morgenstern 's performance as Mary . She did an excellent job of portraying her mixed feelings of pride and pain . The sets of the city were good and there were some great landscape shots , especially from the mountains . I also thought the DTS soundtrack was very good.Those were n't enough to make this a good movie for me though . The beatings grew boring very quickly , which made the final half of the film very tedious for me . Mel Gibson mostly worked in caricatures , portraying the Roman soldiers as mindless brutes , the apostles as dim-witted cowards and the Jews as a rabid mob . James Caviezel did a good enough job playing an impossible role , but I did n't find someone covered in blood or woodenly quoting biblical passages particularly interesting . The scenes with the Satan character did n't work for me at all.There was also the problem that , if you were n't a Christian or familiar with the Christian mythology , this movie would have made no sense at all . I guess to Gibson this was n't a problem , since he was making this film for a specific audience . That audience made him a lot of money , so I suppose the choices he took worked for his pocketbook . That does not make this a great movie though . ( As far as the anti-Semitic question , I agree that this film qualified . The Jews suffered for centuries because of the `` Christ Killer '' label , and this movie echoed that belief . The Romans may have did the killing , but the Jews started the ball rolling , a fact Gibson hammered home repeatedly . Like father , like son . )	-1
Purely from the point of view of watching the movie it was amazing . The film costs here were amazingly well spent ( thats what the stars are for ) . To film a movie in Latin and Aramaic was brilliant and the sets and costumes were amazing . I think they could have saved about half the movie budget by having Jesus expend a human amount of blood but that 's ok -I realize it was necessary for Gibson to stay true to his fundamentalist Catholic views and strictly follow the stations of the cross in depicting the passion of Christ , even though there is no scriptural evidence for them . Having said this though it is important to point out what a horrible theology this movie presents . It is essentially the Anselmian view that Jesus was incarnated as the only sufficient sacrifice for our sins . As this movie presents it the only significant part of Jesus 's life is his death . It is this sort of blood-soaked religious ideology that says it is ok to kill people as a means of purification.Even as an atheist I can see that this is probably the most immoral of all ethical or religious doctrines . If you want a sound theology try Abelard or some of the Franciscan authors . In their writings the incarnation is the culmination of creation , an event that was planned from the beginning and NOT simply a reaction to `` people behaving badly '' . It represents the ultimate unification of God with His creation . The moral lesson comes not from the death of Jesus saving us from our sins . ( which mires human beings in eternal stupidity and does n't apparently cure us of sinfulness either ... so it is pretty much a wash ) The moral message needs to come from Jesus 's life ... take care of lepers , eat with tax collectors , help a prostitute get on her feet . Things get a little messed up but its not anything that can not be fixed by simply doing human things .	-1
I went to see this movie with a very open mind . Initially I was pleased with the cinematography and a little dissapointed with the somewhat contrived acting . The opening part of the movie is by far the most interesting and rich in terms of storyline and aesthetic beauty . This part of the movie is what nails it in the two-star range . What ensues , however , is probably the most deplorable attempt at sensory manipulation I have ever witnessed in my life.In a time when neoconservatism and counterfundamentalist-fundamentalism gripped the United States by the jowels this movie made a somewhat fortuitous entrance onto the world stage . As the bells of war sent young American soldiers out on the battlefield to defend Western hegemonic positions by way of `` the Almighty '' ( Bush 's great justification ) this movie danced across movie theater screens and attempted to do much more than tell the story of the life of Jesus . This movie turns Jesus into a symbol of cultural supremacy , a source of endless blood and suffering , and the American flag manifested in human flesh.As I sat and watched the hour and a half of torture unfold before my eyes I looked around the theater to see the faces of the families which so many claim to exemplify `` family values . '' What these children were watching was not a recreation of a myth aimed at reinforcing social solidarity , but a blatant piece of sensory manipulation which aimed at reinforcing xenophobia and notions of cultural superiority .	-1
From a purely literary viewpoint , the trial and execution of Christ is one of the most powerful stories ever told . But in Mel Gibson 's new film `` The Passion of the Christ '' the fine drama is turned into coarse melodrama , as Gibson concentrates on flaying , blood-flying violence , the kind that appeals to the same people who flock to slasher movies . In fact , there may be those eagerly awaiting `` The Passion of the Christ 2 : Peter Gets His '' . Of course , there is violence in classic art . The Christian iconography of the Renaissance has canvas after canvas of whippings and nailings ; but those images are static and stylized , not the graphic naturalism of motion pictures . Speaking of which : Gibson , in promoting the movie , has emphasized how realistic his picture is , an oblique put-down of the Biblical epics of he Fifties and Sixties . Granted , many of those productions were artificial and sometimes not even very entertaining . ( At the risk of being hunted down by the NRA , I must admit I think `` Ben Hur '' is about 45 minutes too long . ) But the fact is `` The Passion of the Christ '' possesses the same artificialities as those old films -- presenting , for instance , a tall and handsome Jesus . There is a very strong likelihood that the historical Jesus looked more like Woody Allen than Jeffrey Hunter , but Gibson 's realism evidently did n't extend into casting . There are also some unfortunate lapses into what can kindly be called poetic license , including a sit-comish flashback where Mary is confused by a modern table constructed by her smart carpenter son . I 'm giving the picture two stars , one for the cast 's restrained ensemble acting and one for the superb photography of Caleb Deschanel . As for the movie itself , simplistic and sensationalistic , I do n't think it 's at all what Matthew , Mark , Luke and John had in mind .	-1
I watched the Passion of the Christ with my atheist husband . While we were watching all of the blood and guts flying around . He asked a wonderful question . What is the point of this movie ? What is the movie trying to say ? Then I realize that he is totally right this movie does n't really say anything . All we mostly see is Jesus brutally dying on a cross and flashbacks of his life for cheap thrills . I am a Christian and I thought that this movie really did n't have a point . I already knew that Jesus suffered before he died ; it did n't really affect me seeing it so graphically.What I mean is that if you see it from an atheist 's point of view , there is no point to the movie . The movie does n't tell us why Jesus was dying on a cross . Since the movie 's focus is on Jesus ' suffering , the message gets lost to non-believers . Personally , I was more affected by the Book of John than by this movie . Jesus had a lot of love for people in that movie and you could n't help but love Him . You do n't get that watching this movie.Now I would recommend this movie to people who really hate Christians and love seeing artwork of crucifix 's mutilated . You guys can watch Jesus suffering over and over again and laugh your heads off .	-1
As an Asian American male , I can objectively state this movie is highly anti-simitic . Quite frankly , I have no idea what people were looking at when they wholeheartedly claim this movie has no anti-jewish theme . Here are few I found quite objectionable because the biblical account of Jesus 's death has been twisted to place the blame of his cruxifiction solely on the Jews.1 ) Pontius Pilate tries to save Jesus and is portrayed as the good guy . He is not an objective and ruthless Roman governor , but a man who is interested in the truth of Jesus 's teachings . Three separate times , he tries to save Jesus 's life . First , when the Pharisees and the Jews bring battered Jesus to him , he actually complains that they beat him even though he is yet to be convicted of guilt . Then , refusing to condemn the man , he sends him to Herod . When Herod sends Jesus back ( again not finding him guilty ) , Pilate again tries to save Jesus by giving the Jews a choice to save him . The Jews , of course , chooses to save Barabas instead . Then the Pilate tries to save Jesus AGAIN by just beating and flogging Jesus , hoping it will quell the Jew 's anger , the Jews rejects Pilate pleading that Jesus had suffered enough punishment and should be set free . The Jews , and only the Jews , demands Jesus be cruxified.2 ) The high ranking Pharisees are seen beating Jesus with their bare hands . This scene was utterly ridiculous because it was an equivalent of a Pope beating a Jew with his bare hands ( which may have actually happened few hundred years back ) . Not only is this scene unbiblical , but historically unlikely . The Pharisees were very picky about who and what they touched . A blasphemer was considered unclean and untouchable , especially by pharisees , and beating Jesus with their bare hands broke their own strict rules.I found it disturbing that few twists of the story were all catered to blaming the Jews . In this , I found it even more disturbing than Jesus 's death itself . He did die , after all , as a practicing Jew .	-1
If this movie was about anything else other than the passion of Christ the very people who support it would be screaming to ban it . This is an incredibly violent film with needless buckets of blood . Seeing the son of God turned into hamburger did not inspire me or increase or decrease my faith . Truly awful acting from secondary and tertiary actors and blatant homophobia in the Herod portion of the film add to a nasty mix . Good acting from primary actors and superior cinematography are the few saving graces . The bold decision to make this multi-lingual and subtitled also deserves to be tried again . Only for fundamentalist Christians and devout Roman Catholics and not be viewed by anyone under 17 .	-1
I am not cold , nor am I without heart . I cringe when I watch this movie . I weep to think that this would happen to the most guilty of men let alone a good man who 's done nothing to deserve it . And though I am not a Christian I respect the story of Jesus . But , this is the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen portraying his life.99 % of the story , the dialog , and the violence is not an accurate portrayal . It 's not just that most of the story is made up or is n't accurate according to the Bible , but most of the dialog is made up too . Most of what is supposed to be from the Gospels is altered in some way to say something other that what scripture says.The violence in itself is another story . Though it is told that Jesus was tortured and suffered , the violence depicted in the movie just is n't realistic . It 's not just that 99 % of it is n't mentioned in the Bible , but there is no way on Earth that Jesus could have survived 20 minutes into the movie . If he had n't bled to death first , the fishhook type whips used on him would not only have ripped his flesh off his body , but gone in and ripped out his internal organs too . It 's just not realistic . No one could have survived that . Not even the Son of God.The portrayal of the Roman soldiers that beat Jesus was n't realistic either . I know that the Roman soldiers were cruel and could be sadistic but the way they are portrayed in this film is as much over the top as all the violence . The Bible mentions nothing of all this punishment . He was n't beaten and whipped and kicked around the way they showed as he carried his cross to Calvary . He fell three ( 3 ) times . And most of the portrayal that went on with him being nailed to the cross and set up is n't mentioned at all . Him being flipped over the way he was . Geez ! What this movie blatantly is , is an attempt to play on the emotions of those who believe so deeply in the story of Jesus . Period . It 's false propaganda and it plays its part well . You can tell by all the reviews stating this was the most realistic version they 'd ever seen . Do n't buy into it.Any Christian who is interested in watching a more accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus would be far better off watching Jesus of Nazareth . Or any non-Christian who 's just interested in learning about Jesus ' life . The real purpose of Jesus ' life is portrayed in Jesus of Nazareth , and done very well . His teachings . That is what is really important , not this excessively violent and unrealistic version.I 'm giving this movie two stars because of the use of Aramaic and Latin , and because the cinematography was beautiful . Oh , and because the rendition of Satan was really creepy .	-1
This film leaves so much to be desired by the time the closing credits roll , you wonder why you sat through it in the first place . It appears to have absolutely no purpose ... just meanders along violently ... never giving ... and there are few stories whether true or fictional that are better more exciting fare for good film-making than this -- so the plot was thick and ripe for an amazing movie experience ... but they just didnt pull it off unfortunately . If you love the Jesus story you will be sadly dissappointed by this strange twisted desultory mess of a film .	-1
I cried when I saw The PASSION OF THE CHRIST - how could you not ? I sat there and watched a man brutalized for two hours . Everyone around me was crying - it felt like we were all tuned in to the proceedings of a televised execution . I was a little confused by the time it was all over & as I was leaving the theater , I was even more so : I saw parents walking out with their children . Jesus Christ 's teachings were left in the wings , the significance of his life locked out of the script almost entirely . Hardly a first impression for young children . The ONLY things I found at all interesting about the PASSION OF THE CHRIST : the use of the authentic languages from the time period ( Latin & Aramaic ) and the actors bringing this movie to life . James Caviezel 's performance in Terrence Malick 's THE THIN RED LINE was simply mesmerizing , and he used a similar pallet of emotion for his performance here . I was raised a Roman Catholic - so viewing the Stations of the Cross was nothing new to me . To suggest this film version of that seasonal meditation is a `` masterwork '' - simply is absurd.So what WAS the point of this film , what were we to draw from its brutal imagery ? There was no inspiration in Mel Gibson 's film for me , no arc of understanding - only suffering and death . Which led me to consider their goal may have been to create a vivid emotional experience , intended to lift us out of numbness and inspire reflection on faith to get us through this life : televised warfare , beheadings on the internet , stories of sickness and shootings on the nightly news , etc . Perhaps , but I do n't think so . A fleeting , knee-jerk reaction with some tears shed on queue , and then those emotions are safely placed back on the shelf until the next time . Complicity and silence have always gone hand in hand : it 's easy to damn this world , condemn what we see as different from our own huddled beliefs ; allow selfishness and insincerity to decimate through clouds of frankincense and joyous hymns . Salvation ? Maybe.The infamous THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST , directed by Martin Scorsese , is a `` masterwork '' of filmmaking . The film not only inspires the heart , but also prods the mind . I could feel the breath of those images , allowing me to enter the world it created and truly feel something more than myself . It was not an epiphany ; it was a fresh view , it was an enlightened dream of another world , yet strangely our own . The film did n't plague the audience with blood and horrors ; it dramatizes the passion and relevance of the story . I 've come to understand and believe Jesus Christ to be among the greatest teachers this world has known , who suffered the tortures of the damned to inspire his vision of peace , determination for truth and humility in us all - ideals that have taken a back seat to robotic , indignant servitude to skewed `` moral '' interests.The LAST TEMPTATION was based on the book by Nikos Kazantzakis - from which the filmmakers created a thoughtful , passionate re-examination of one of the greatest stories ever told . Mr. Scorsese , in his youth , had almost joined the priesthood ; but chose to explore and express his passion through the cinema . I saw no blasphemy in his images - only a powerful film exploring faith in ourselves and the world . Often cited as trash , garbage and against popular faith - this film truly offers a story of FAITH we can all profit from , regardless of what we believe .	-1
I ca n't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches . Frankly , I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets . If anything , it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen . If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion , I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread . Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness , but you wo n't find them in this sick piece of trash .	-1
I rented this movie undeterred by the negative reviews regarding too much violence that I had heard from friends . After all , I thought depictions of graphic violence would help illustrate how horrible the crucifixion was . Unfortunately graphic violence alone is n't enough to give this movie the emotional impact that the subject deserves.The audience goes into this movie with knowledge of who and what Jesus is . For this reason Mel Gibson apparently thought that no character establishing scenes were necessary . All we learn from this movie is that Jesus was a guy who suffered a lot . In fact the ultra-violence actually made the crucifixion seem less agonizing to me . I could n't help but think that after losing about 3 gallons of blood ( based on the large pools left on the ground after he was flogged ) and the beatings he took about the head , that Jesus would have been too far gone by the time he was nailed to the cross to feel much pain . The few , brief scenes which did n't involve Jesus ' torture were mostly uninspired clips of events which occurred in the days prior to the crucifixion . These are scenes that those who have read the bible are all too familiar with , and the dull , monotone delivery by the actors does nothing to bring these scenes to life . The scenes of Satan and demonic children throughout the movie seem random and silly . How the writers and director could do so little with such a great story bewilders me.A far more moving movie is Jesus of Nazareth . The only objection I have heard about Jesus of Nazareth is that Jesus is played by a non-Jew with blue eyes . If you ca n't get over that then you will be depriving yourself of seeing a movie about Jesus that delivers far more insight into what a wise , charismatic , and loving entity Jesus was . Brilliant performances combined with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack make the crucifixion scenes in Jesus of Nazareth carry far more emotion impact than the passion of the Christ did .	-1
If you are really serious about faith , grace , committment , what one is suppose to do in this world , how we are to respond and take care of others , Gibson 's mindless Hollywood Smash here is useless and a gross waste of time . It reminded me of a Playstation or XBOX game come to life in the screen.Jesus was a subversive a revolutionary , He wanted you to know his Father and what the Word of God means , and how one conducts himself in the beauty of one 's faith . For a deeper understanding of what I am talking about please see Pasolini 's `` The Gospel According to St.Matthew '' . There all the Hollywood buzz , hype , blitz , zizztz is removed . This is a film from the early Sixties and Pasolini was quite brave to make it , portraying Jesus as a revolutionary , and giving one something to think about . With Gibson as most Hollywood films you check your brain at the Box Office before entering.What does Gibson tell you here about Jesus , any new insight into belief and faith in our post 9/11 era ? ? Nothing at all , just gratuitous violence that is `` Fun '' for many unfortunately .	-1
I should have left this review a long time ago . I could kick myself for buying it , thinking it was a film , not a religous object . If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals , you risk being burned at the stake , an act of love to purify your soul.This film , as a film , disregarding the topic , is a dog . A cheap `` B '' grade , blood spurting , flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles . I could go on for an hour , but wo n't bother .	-1
Christ is to Adult ... as Santa Claus is to Child . What kind of sick mind would let their kid watch this pornographic trash ? The kind of person who thinks `` Jesus '' is going to `` come back '' . The type of person who believes MILLIONS are going to `` HELL '' , if they are `` unsaved '' . The fact that this MYTH of Jesus and the Bible continues to hold sway the world over is nauseating . This religious nonsense has gone on long enough . Throw this sick fantasy away and instead use common sense .	-1
I just viewed this movie last weekend , and finally I get to see a better portrayal of the religious story.I understand that Jesus in the stories is beaten and scourged before his crucifixtion , so there has to be a movie where we get to view Jesus finally experiencing pain . Of all the films that have been made on the passion , this one is the most accurate , but still not perfect.What 's wrong with it ? How about the retarded little things Mel Gibson inserts , like the devil , or small children chasing Judas Iscariot . What a fluke , I laughed my butt off at that part . Just stick to the official stories of the bible there Mel . Your just proving that religion is worthless and can be rewritten as stories just like that . Also the dropping of Jesus off a bridge was funny.One last thing I 'd like to point out is the terrible scourging of Jesus . At first it was believable , but after they used those inch and a half hook whips that dug into the table , but still only managed to rip Jesus ' skin off after about 70 or so whipings was absolutly mental . I know for a fact with those whips , they would 've ripped all his flesh on his back right off the bone . Terrible terrible , it would 've killed him . But still , he manges to stand up and carry , probably more than 100 pound big piece of wood , WHILE enduring more whippings , beatings , nails in his hands and feet AND without any hydration . *rolls eyes*Did I mention Jesus is still a white man from the Middle East ? *cough*Watch this for its take on the STORIES in the bible written by men , not for historical content .	-1
Not the great or best look at the Gettyburg battle and the events that led up to and occurd during the battle along with the people involved . It is to short .	-1
As I remember vaudeville was n't in style until the early 1900 and yet here is Jesus doing shtick . I do believe that he could smile and see humor in some situations but the Sermon on the Mount was not one of them . I could only make it through 9:9 and had to turn it off . Just too much levity for my taste.Joy and happiness should be in the heart , mind and soul . Not external as depicted in this movie . I kept waiting for the custard pies to start flying.But , in all fairness , the movie was beautifully filmed .	-1
Possibly the worst kid 's movie I 've ever seen . My wife opined that this `` was the worst movie in the history of the universe . `` Well , maybe not , but strictly for girls under age 6 .	-1
I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL , LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON , SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD , BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO # 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST . I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED . I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE , SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT ? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA , AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE .	-1
I remember seeing this little movie when I was 10 or 11 and was quite shocked by it . Imagine my disappointmet when I got this horrible transfer into my player ! Anchor Bay , one of my absolute favorite distribution companies , has failed . The print is terribly scratched and the sound goes in and out towards the end . Do n't bother .	-1
This one totally bites . Unless you were born in the 40 's this one is completely out of date . No bite no bang and way too much buck . The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room . Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers . Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot . If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride . That 's a biker flick . This is yet another example of how phony the 60 's were . Save your money . I wish I had .	-1
I was not entertained and found the movie without story or goal . A lot of do nothing people doing nothing . I did n't think it possible for Jack Nicholson to make a bad movie . I was wrong .	-1
It took a month for me to actually receive this film . I have been waiting for years to see this , the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection . I should have waited longer . Even if you do n't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print , or that the title is spelled wrong , or that the cover and label are ugly as sin ... you should not buy it . Why ? Because the last chapter of the disc does n't play ! You ca n't even watch the whole film all the way through . I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same . I 'm going to avoid all DVDs from & quot ; Cine Vu & quot ; from now on .	-1
The DVD is terrible . First , though the cover promises a widescreen transfer , the DVD is horribly cropped , so 50 % of the scope image is missing.If that were n't bad enough , the picture quality is very , very poor and during motion scenes ( most of the film ) the picture blurs ! The old Goodtimes LP speed VHS tape from the 80s looks better than this.Avoid at all costs !	-1
First things first , I hate to admit it but I 've never read Emily Bronte 's classic novel ` Wuthering Heights ' , therefore I ca n't comment on whether or not this cinematic production from '98 is an accurate retelling of the tragic love story of Heathcliff and Cathy.Secondly , I do n't see any reason to give a synopsis of the plot since the majority of people reading this review are already quite familiar with the storyline.That now said , I will say that this is one of the most bizarre , depressing and unromantic love stories I 've ever seen . The two love birds , Heathcliff ( Robert Cavanah ) and Cathy ( Orla Brady ) are myopic , narcissistic , manipulative , cruel and overall downright unlikable . What can you conclude about a guy whose only comment after his true loves death is , `` Did she mention me ? `` Final Thoughts : Beautiful cinematography , wonderful production values and attractive period costumes ca n't compensate for two main characters you just ca n't force yourself to care about . Maybe this is your cup of tea , but it 's not mine .	-1
Really did not enjoy this movie at all . I did not like the actors and it just did not do anything for me .	-1
A very plotless movie about a ww2 american soldier and japanese soldier on a deserted island -- -- sort of thing THE TWILIGHT ZONE did a lot better in 30 minutes ; this plotless movie is almost two hours ! Even a 30 minute TWILIGHT ZONE episode in which Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery are opposing survivers of ww3 had more dialogue and plot than this movie.From director John Boorman -- -his DELIVERANCE is a million time better , though it 's as much a jungle movie as this thing .	-1
Roman Britain ? Not quite . A fun foray into Hammer 's skewed history ? Definitely . This film works on the most basic level . Warrior chicks and Roman villainy with a mad druid for fun . The best acting in this little sizzler comes from that late great charactor actor Patrick Toughton . There are moments when it seems like he is in a completely different film ... yes , he 's that good . Andrew Keir is not to be missed as the scenery chewing evil centurion . A mediocre effort at historical film making , but a great deal of fun !	-1
This was not a box office hit when it was first released ; most critics hated it . Time has not tempered its many flaws . The humor is broad and at times overbearing , abrasive . The lead character is a nitwit , obnoxiously stupid . Oddly enough , this is the only character played for laughs , the rest are deadly serious in their intent ( none more so than Oliver Reed as the villain , one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary enterprise ) . The effect is quite jarring , as though they forgot to inform Michael Crawford that they had changed their minds , the piece was now a gritty spy thriller . Unfortunately , it 's never as funny as it should have been , and not serious enough to work on any other level.This is not a movie I 'd ever want to watch again under any circumstance .	-1
C'mon people ! Five stars for this garbage ? I 'm a big horror fan , I like & quot ; weird and offbeat horror & quot ; , and have enjoyed other Italian horror films by such directors as Mario Bava . Based on the great reviews of this movie on this site , I decided to pick this one up and was I ever disappointed . It 's not scary and you 'll see more gore in a Friday the 13th or Freddy Kreuger movie . The plot is so incoherent that the film becomes absolutely tiresome to watch . The only good things about it are seeing Jennifer Connelly run around in her nightgown , and the heavy metal soundtrack ( which actually sounds very misplaced in parts of the film ) . The best part of the DVD is listening to the commentary by the filmmakers , who actually seem to think they 've made some great piece of art with this film , when it 's really just high-budget amateur hour . The only reason to watch this film is if you want to see a slightly weird , bad horror movie . If you do watch it , keep your expectations waaaay low .	-1
Produced by Dario Argento and directed by Lamberto Bava , this hyper-gory Italian film is about a group of people who are all given free tickets to a horror movie . Soon after it begins , the unsuspecting moviegoers , like the characters in the film , start turning into flesh-hungry zombies . It all sounds promising enough , but that 's where the originality ends . The audience inexplicably finds itself trapped inside the theater and the rest of the movie is pure formula : a group of anonymous , one-dimensional characters is picked off one by one by the zombies , only to become zombies themselves , who ( you guessed it ) pick off the remaining anonymous , one-dimensional characters . Of course , Bava knows that it 's all about the gore and , on that score at least , Demons really delivers . There 's enough gut munching , eye gouging and scalp tearing to satisfy even the most hardened gorehound , and the special effects ( courtesy of Argento regular Sergio Stivaletti ) are about as good as they come . Thirty-something types will also appreciate the early ` 80s heavy-metal soundtrack , which features M & ouml ; tley Cr & uuml ; e ( `` Save Our Souls '' ) and Accept ( `` Fast as a Shark '' ) , among others.Two and a half stars out of five .	-1
It has a stupid plot - just natzis killing bedwins and bedwins getting even and it continues into a stupid violent movie of cold blooded killing . if you love violence watch this but do n't waste your time - this movie is not worth the 3 bucks used DVD . The portrait of violence is ugly and upsetting .	-1
Automatically this movie gives off a typical seventies version of a horror movie , complete with skin tight jockey shorts , fading pastel colors and scooby doo hair doos . The beginning leads the viewer to believe that something evil is learking off in the distance , like a predator seeking it 's prey . Yet how far can one go with a black car , with tinted windows who spends most of the movie gunning people down , off the roads . Never is there any evidence that someone is behind the wheel , for all the viewer knows it could be a 16 year old with a remote control out for kicks . It 's VERY far fetched , and annyoing to watch , as no one is clever enough to just blow the stupid thing up , until the very end . Not to mention all the graded , loud music that sounds like someone scraping together pieces of metal ... it 's not enough for any true horror fan to stand for a whole hour and a half ... .not to mention there was never any hope for a sequel ... & quot ; Car The Revenge ? ? & quot ; Give me a break ! N.C .	-1
Out of every christmas movie I 've seen , never has one made me so depressed . I do n't feel like there 's much more that I can say without giving away plot points , in case you do want to watch it ... but really ... .did not leave me feeling jolly at all ( especially the fact that elves do n't work for santa , dead people do . That 's right , once you die you go to work in santas sweat shop ) .	-1
the writing and acting is so poor compared to the new hit show , Downton Abbey . I suppose back when it was on , it was ok , but nothing like Downton Abbey !	-1
Unresolved technical issues with this series.Sound and the color is absent from some . Hopefully Amazon will eventually correct this , because the series itself is worth watching . but for now ... do n't waste your money .	-1
I think that Samantha Morton 's Jane Eyre in Robert Young 's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel , could 've been the best screen Jane ever . Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess , childlike in the appearance but strong willed , serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong . Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen 's `` Sweet and Lowdown '' , Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face , by her impressive and speaking eyes alone . It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length , but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel 's two main characters and their relationship . Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book . The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds . Hinds is a talented , intense actor but I ca n't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester 's character . Some his scenes in the film made me cringe . Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much . I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele . This manifestation was against the logic of his character.2.5/5	-1
This 1997 TV production is called `` Jane Eyre '' , but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront 's literary masterpiece . How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot , who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me , but they did . This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds they had two good actors , who even physically fit their roles well , but , alas , the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation . Samantha Morton - young , delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre , but does not play Jane Eyre . Her Jane is far too bold , even disrespectful at times , self-confident and self-satisfied , bossy and pert . Gone is the interesting duality of Jane 's character in the novel , her outward shyness , guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other . Morton 's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film . There is no subtlety in her performance , her Jane undergoes no change and no development . The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester . Believe it or not , but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully . Luckily Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds possesses some charisma , but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel . Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester 's character , his many contradicting facets , his moodiness , his inner struggle , his humour and his tenderness . The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times , but never the unrefined , snarling brute Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds makes him . Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester , and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles : Blanche , besides being blonde , is not in the least haughty enough , not to mention the fact that she is nice to Ad & egrave ; le , St. John is all smiles and kindness , and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up , probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones . Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront 's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience . The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter 's own banal lines . In either case they have lost all the charm , sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel . Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words : `` I know it may sound silly but ... . '' No , Mr. Hawley , if somebody sounds silly here , it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront ' ! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding , a scene , by the by , which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment . Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront 's Jane , the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront 's Rochester . What ? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him , bullying her , throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay ? Absolutely ridiculous ! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.This is the worst , but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous : the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook , Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic 's room to sniff at Mason 's wounds like a wild beast , Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.Equally lamentable is the filmmakers ' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies . Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot . Sentences like `` I feel that your passions are aroused '' are appropriate for `` Sex in the City '' , but not for a costume drama , let alone Jane Eyre . Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel , nor about portraying the novel 's era accurately . The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre . The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006 .	-1
Cirian Hinds and Samantha Morton are wonderful actors , but why did n't the screenwriters even glance at Charlotte Bronte 's book when they wrote this screenplay ? It was a very strange experience to see some of my favorite characters of literature saying and doing things that were n't even remotely connected to the story . Rochester screaming at Jane to leave Thornfield ? Jane and Rochester shopping downtown for wedding clothes and `` bumping into '' Blanche Ingram ? I do n't think so ! Not only did the screenwriters make up entirely new scenes , the dialogue in familiar scenes was often totally unrecognizable . I watch film adaptations to see my favorite characters and scenes fleshed out , not given a major overhaul.Two things they got right -- the age difference and chemistry between Rochester and Jane ( although Samantha Morton is too pretty . Come on ! She ca n't be pretty Harriet Smith in the A & E ; version of `` Emma '' and plain-Jane Eyre in this movie ! ) If you just like to watch good acting , you might like this . But if you , like me , are a fan of the book , this is a very jolting and unpleasant ride .	-1
When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson 's `` Jane Eyre '' movie , they had to leave everything out that could n't be condensed . The mini-series approach , however , allows ample time to study the characters in depth . In my 29 years , I recall not one , but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s . These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience . I wo n't judge which of the two is more definitive , having only read part of the book.The 1983 one , released to VHS/DVD , starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke . Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane , mistreated by her aunt Reed 's family and at Lowood school . This is the first hour of the series , and I was riveted . When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives , Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they 're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack . The series is excellent , almost to the point where I 'd call it treachery that it 's not available either on VHS or DVD . This was no minor production : in fact , it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.Dalton 's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious , almost a caricature . It 's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion . Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side , but balances sardonic wit with what 's been called a `` poetic imagination . '' Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane . You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role . His enthusiasm for the part is obvious . Clarke 's Jane is plain , and seeks independence , love and servitude , but it 's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from . It 's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking , although that may be . Cusack , an Irish actress , is irresistable in more ways than one . A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate , she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester , trading jabs , despite the difference in age and experience . Thus , in the early scenes , we get a good sense of Jane Eyre 's spiritedness ( even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood ) . The interaction of Dalton and Clarke , while fine , falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.Other things to note : the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK . The memorable theme music was the passionate `` Introduction and Allegro '' composed by one of Britain 's greatest , Sir Edward Elgar . My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft , the screenwriter , Robin Chapman , and to the cast : Megs Jenkins ( Mrs. Fairfax ) , Stephanie Beacham ( Blanche Ingram ) , Geoffrey Whitehead ( St. John Rivers ) , Susan Brodrick ( Mary Rivers ) , Caroline Harris ( Diana Rivers ) , Edward De Souza ( Richard Mason ) , and the rest.It 's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them . `` Jane Eyre '' is a classic novel . Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale . In fact , it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale , now . Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of `` Jane Eyre '' is not `` bad , '' and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.If you write to the powers-that-be , BBC America or BBC Worldwide , they 'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release . Go ahead and give it a try . Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.There is a website dedicated to the 1973 series that can be easily found . Look online also for an image of the Radio Times cover that announced the original broadcast .	-1
Since I did n't know the story I was disappointed by it . The acting was OK but the story itself was not something that I had expected . I enjoy all of Jane Austins works and stories such as hers , also Downton Abby , Cranford , North and South . This was not of the same class , neither story line or acting .	-1
My husband and I watched this movie , and felt we had waisted our money . Pride and Prejudice FAR outweighs this one.First of all , the music in this movie we found to be barely tolerable.Secondly , In my opinion , the foul language could have been left out of this movie . Making it a bit more family friendly . Thirdly , We did watch it till the end , but it was a drudgery.I have read the book and will say that they perhaps did the best they could at putting this book on screen as it would be a difficult screen play to write . But some liberties were taken in the movie that I did n't like.Overall , it was a waste of time and money.On the other hand , Pride and Prejudice , Persuasion , and Jane Austen 's Emma are excellent movies on which to spend your valuable time and money .	-1
The performances were passable - in my opinion Mark Strong did a fine job . Since this dvd is an early presentation , sorry to say I was disappointed in the quality and could do nothing to improve the viewing experience . Sadly , I returned the video - the return process with Amazon was very amicable - that 's the only positive I could come up with , that is why this review receives a one star rating .	-1
no no no boring boring and again very boring - we all know the old story very well , but is not done well in this movie	-1
She belongs on todays sitcoms . The other characters were fine , but she was so modernly caustic , if this can be said .	-1
Kate Beckinsale 's performance , to me , seemed extremely one dimensional . We certainly see the vanity , but none of the compassion which makes Emma a worthy ( albeit immature ) hero traveling along her arc . By comparison , Gwenyth Paltrow 's performance ( within a year ) shows us a misguided socialite , who repeatedly displays compassion.The best example might concern Emma 's view of Martin . While Paltrow tells us he is beneath her , she also points out that were he less fortunate ( than he is ) , she would feel honor bound to help him . Kate 's Emma , on the other hand , simply despise him for no good reason.Having watched both features back to back , Beckinsale strike 's me as a twin sister of Mrs. Elton , rather than Austin 's kind-hearted , but misguided Emma.I would recommend forgoing this version and taking Paltrow 's instead .	-1
I agree the the reviewer 's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington . No one would take him for a Virginian ; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent . Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle : `` how many killed ? '' `` None '' ( correct ) . `` How many wounded ? '' `` none '' . Incorrect . There were four wounded one of whom , the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe . Fifth president of the United States . Worth mentioning I would think .	-1

There is irony in the fact that when I came here to review this the advertisement shown was for `` The Dark Knight Rises . '' I had just been shaking my head over the fact that whoever filmed this apparently decided to loan Sir Percy Batman 's utility belt.I 've read the books and enjoyed them , but I do n't insist that a Scarlet Pimpernel movie be a down-to-the-last-detail adaptation . But this show had a crudeness and vulgarity that the novels simply did n't have , and it seems to me that if you 're going to appropriate a book 's title the least you should be expected to do is not butcher the entire flavor of the story.This Scarlet Pimpernel is n't demmed elusive , he just goes storming in with more weaonry than his opponents and kills people right , left , and center . The elusiveness is what the story is supposed to be about : a trickster who outsmarts his opponents and is almost always so many steps ahead of him that he does n't need to resort to brute force . There was no delight in watching it - ha ! I did n't see that coming ! Oh , marvelous ! - as there should be.The book was wildly romantic in a purple-prose sort of way , and I simply ca n't see this version of Sir Percy kneeling down to kiss the ground Marguerite has walked on . And there is very little difference between the way this one acts when he 's being Sir Percy and when he 's being the Pimpernel ; no reason anybody would dismiss the very thought that Sir Percy might be the intrepid , mocking shadow that is driving the French authorities to distraction.Even apart from those objections , the story is quite muddled . Having read the books , I knew pretty much what was going on , but if I had n't I would have been left baffled.Complete lack of chemistry between Percy and MargueriteDo yourself a favor : Watch the Leslie Howard version , or the Anthony Andrews version . This one is n't even going to stay in my video collection . A la laterne with this DVD !	-1
Dont get me wrong . This is a great movie , and the second one is great too . But these transfers to DVD 's are complete rip offs ! Where are the bonus features ? ? ? ? ? They may come with trailers , full screen , and subtitles ... . but I was very disapointed when these came out on DVD and had nothing else included on them . And I know the stuff exsists ! I remember very clearly watching a behind the scenes featurette on home alone , and home alone 2 when they where about to be released . I remember Daniles talkin about how he was the guy in charge of whats funny , and i remember them talking about how it wasnt filmed at christmas and they had fake snow , and fake pigeons ect ... . WHERE ARE THOSE FEATURES ? ? ? ? ? To a person who dosent care about bonus features . Then go ahead and buy these great movies . But for someone like me who does want things like that , espesicly for such a huge comedy smash hit like these 2 movies , youd expect more wouldnt you ? Even Audio comentary would be nice ? Why is this blockbuster sucses treated so poorly on the DVD release ? ITS NOT EVEN IN SURROUND SOUND ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( 5.1 ) I hope they release a better special edition of these films with features worth buying , to replace the old VHS copys most of us have . Untill then , keep your videos , the dvd 's arnt worth getting yet	-1
THANK GOD IT 'S FRIDAY is a hokey little film that record labels Cassablanca and Motown put together to capitalize on the Saturday Night Fever craze that was happening in the late 1970s . Like a cheezy `` Love Boat '' episode , there are multiple stock characters here such as the aspiring entertainer ( Donna Summer ) , the womanizer ( Jeff Goldbloom ) , the bickering married couple , the `` Good Girl '' ( Debra Winger ) and various singles looking for that `` special hookup '' while the disco beat thumps on and on and on . Worth a look to catch disco styles of the late 70 's and see Donna Summer sing the Oscar-winning song `` Last Dance . ''	-1
Words fail me in attempting to describe just how poor a movie In the Company of Men is . Aside from obvious flaws like the lack of a single compelling or sympathetic character , Men suffers from amateurish acting , a painfully bad script devoid of any wit or insight , and a frighteningly shallow and stilted portrait of men and male behavior . As bad a movie as you are likely to find anywhere .	-1
I vividly remember seeing `` CE3K '' as a teenager and I especially remember the ads with the long stretch of highway and the ominous quote `` We are not alone ! '' . Seeing the film 25 years later makes me wonder what all the fuss was about . This has to be one of Steven Spielberg 's most overated films . It resembles a tv mini-series , long and plodding , and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions . I 'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it ! As with many early Spielberg films , there are lots of noisy , irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia . After a long hour and a half , these people finally make it to Devil 's Tower , where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans . This sequence is still dazzling , but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show . And , oh yes , that five note tone gets really irritating by the end of the movie ! I was disappointed with the quality of the dvd as well . There is a highly noticable `` shimmering '' in the interogation scene between Dreyfess and the government agents . Also , the night sky scenes looked uneven with streaks of gray overlapping the blacks . Many scenes were `` soft '' and uneven . The bonus disc , however , is very nice and contains great interviews and a documentary about the making of the film .	-1
I was sorely disappointed with this movie . I loved it when I was a kid , but after watching it for the first time since it was in theatres , I just was n't impressed at all . I saw the DVD and could n't resist , but I wish I would have . This has got to be one of the slowest movies I 've ever seen . Spielberg never has been too impressive in my opinion , but this is pathetic . At least Jaws and E.T . have some action throughout the entire movie . Here you get a small glimpse of the alien happenings at the beginning , 1.25 hours of boredom , and an ending that just was n't nearly as good as it was when I was kid . My kids could n't stand it , so it 's obviously not a timeless classic , like the other space/alien movies of the late 70s early 80s .	-1
Could n't understand the hype and praise about this smothering piece of forgettable artsy-fartsy film . My friend and I could not wait to get out of the movie . Sensory overload , pseudo-intellectual/historical overkill , a morass of images and cacophonies -- -please , spare us and other hapless victims this unnecessary cinematic trash .	-1
A disappointing treatment of a Cyperpunk classic , Johnny Mnemonic tries too hard and in doing so completely fails to impress . The dark , oppresive atmosphere of William Gibson 's future comes across rather well only to be spoiled by blunt and unimaginative acting . The special effect sequences suffer the same fate and come across more like a poor advertisement for the land of tomorrow than an accurate depiction of Gibson 's view of the Internet of the future . All in all the movie 's a real let down and there 's more to be gained by reading Gibson 's Cyberpunk novels : Neuromancer , Count Zero , Mona Lisa Overdrive and Burning Chrome ( the short story collection from which Johnny Mnemonic was taken ) END	-1
In the future of `` Johnny Mnemonic , '' couriers with chips implanted in their brains must smuggle their gigabytes past the shady underworld of the ever-present Yakusa and the `` low-tech '' rebel groups bent on destroying technology . Johnny ( Keanu Reeves ) is one such courier , desperate to end his career so he can reclaim the memories he has had to sacrifice . He agrees to one last mission , one that threatens to kill him , both from those who want the information and from the information itself seeping into his nervous system . Everyone wants his head - literally.It has been said that Keanu Reeves can not act , and this film is indisputable proof of that . He has two expressions : dumb and angry . Sometimes he goes from one `` emotion '' to the other in a split second . In Reeves 's defense , however , the script gives him little to work with . His character is one-dimensional - he wants his memory back , but never badly enough to drive him . Even worse , he is surrounded by vague supporting characters : a former bodyguard suffering from an ill-defined syndrome that seems to affect a large percentage of the population ; a rebel leader ( Ice-T ) who does little more than spout one-line pronouncements ; a corporate executive who lost his only daughter to the same disease afflicting the bodyguard ; and a Yakusa boss with no definition whatsoever . Why is there a rebel group ? Why does information have to be regularly smuggled ? Why is Johnny 's chip government-approved , even though he seems to have no connection to officials ? These questions are never answered , or even hinted at.William Gibson , the father of cyberpunk , wrote the screenplay based on one of his short stories . Perhaps because of the originally shorter length , the film is sketchy , stretched by Tron-like images ( Tron ( 20th Anniversary Collector 's Edition ) ) and an apocalyptic world reminiscent ofMad Max ( Special Edition ) . William Gibson should stick to writing novels , as he seems unsure of how to develop this very different medium.I do n't recommend this film , not even for Keanu Reeves fans .	-1
This review is for the Director 's Cut version of the DVD . After all the good reviews on Amazon and from others , I was looking forward to seeing this movie . Thankfully , I rented it.After about 1 hour and 15 minutes , I turned it off . To sum it up : BORING.So what happens during the first 1 hour and 15 minutes ? There is a party . Then they set sail in das boot . They have no specific orders ... just cruise around the ocean . They are spotted by a destroyer . They endure depth charges . They keep sailing.Some people will likely critique my review , saying that war can be boring . That 's fine . I 'm not at war . I 'm watching a movie . Good movies are not about hum-drum everyday life . They have some substance . This movie has no substance . At least Seinfeld ( a TV comedy series about nothing ) has something to offer . Das Boot -- the Director 's Cut has very little to offer . After watching and waiting for something to happen for 1.25 hours , I was n't about to waste another couple of hours on this extended version of the movie in hopes that something would happen.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections	-1
THis is unbeliavable . Jon Voight being in it ... Everything is so bad , so ludicrous , so lame and mean . THe acting , the sanke , the plot , the ending , the beginning , the special effects , the scenario . My God , it 's awful ! ! It 's so awful that , even resisting , you 'll find a smile forming on your face , so funny it is . So , I 'm giving the note the producers surely wwanted to take when they shoot this : one star . Congratulations ! !	-1
Hey , producers ... Stop making killer animal movies please . Snakes , sharks , piranhas , bees , killer insects etc . OR try to write a better scenario . Even jennifer lopez could not save the day !	-1
Save your money and time.Just say no to this disaster of a movie	-1
I believe all movies should get a chance . Most film critics do n't beleive that , using hype , budget , production difficulty , and false over-expectation to shoot a movie down before it even has a chance to defend itself . And I 'll admit , in it 's original theatrical release I did n't give this movie much of a chance . Then I watched it on HBO and thought it was okay , better than I thought at least . The actors are good actors but they seemed to just not care about this movie , the effects are good but anaconda 's could n't never move so fast and agressivly , the story is good , but if you do a movie like this make the snake behave correctly , get actors who give a crap , and do n't have such a corny human villian .	-1
Jon Voight is the only credible Actor here.ICE CUBE & amp ; Jennifer Lopez Ca n't Act at all.the Effects are Funnier than they should be the same goes for the Script.Avoid this Film at all Costs .	-1
I remember when this film first came out and I saw the trailer . It was the scene with the very young Natalie Portman asking Jean Reno what his job is , and he answers `` cleaner , '' then she says `` you mean a hitman , '' he confirms it , and she says , `` cool . '' It looked intriguing and I aways wanted to see it.I was n't expecting `` Sansho the Bailiff , '' but at least a coherent storyline , believable characters , and events that could actually happen on some planet somewhere . Leon , played by Jean Reno , is supposedly the best hit man in New York , but he lives in a hovel while his handler , `` Tony '' played by Danny Aiello , claims to be holding his money for him . I fully expected some showdown between those two , as everything was telegraphing that Tony had no intention of ever letting Leon have his money except for doling out a little occasionally . It is also revealed that Leon is illiterate , drinks only milk , and is inordinately attached to a houseplant that he introduces as his `` only friend . '' Very well , a hit man is never going to be `` normal '' in any sense.Mathilda , played by Natalie Portman , asks Leon to allow her to be his apprentice after her family is murdered . Leon tries to cheer her up with a puppet , showing himself to be at heart a funny and playful fellow ( he also likes old musicals ) , but the relationship between the two is implausible . Leon agrees to take her on after she fires off a few rounds from his balcony and they have to suddenly leave the apartment , houseplant in hand , when any real hitman would have left her there as too great a risk . She soon comes in handy when she can fill out the registration card at the hotel they next stay in , but surely Leon has stayed in hotels in the past - how did he register before ? In a particularly amoral scene , Leon shows Mathilda how to shoot a rifle , firing what turns out to be a squib at a jogger . As someone who has owned and used firearms for many years , I can vouch for the fact that the normal course of instruction involves practicing at a range with paper targets , or in the desert with soda cans , before actually shooting at a live target . Hardly `` professional '' as Leon says about Mathilda 's balcony shooting spree.Stripping away the violence and lurid charm of a hitman , at bottom this is the story of a middle-aged curmudgeon forced to care for a waif , and developing an attachment against his better judgment . This was done far better two years later in the Academy-Award winning `` Kolya , '' a vastly superior film with a significant historical and political element utterly lacking from `` The Professional . `` `` The Professional '' is yet another one suitable only for those who have committed to seeing every film ever made .	-1
Luc Besson 's film on the relationship between a professional hitman ( Jean Reno ) and an orphaned girl ( Natalie Portman ) who seeks protection from the murderous rampage of a corrupt narcotics cop ( Gary Oldman . ) There are several problems with both the plot and theme of this movie which , taken together , make the film both unrealistic and perverse.First of all , there is nothing professional about the supposed professional hitman played by Jean Reno ; as the character portrayed seems to suffer from retardation and ineptitude . An otherwise professional sociopath suddenly has a heart for a defenseless little girl ? But it does n't stop there . The relationship between Portman and Reno has strong sexual overtones which Besson intentionally emphasized by the mood of the dialogue and , most importantly , the very suggestive camera angles on Nataly Portman : the continuous angling of the camera on Portman 's hips , waste , crotch , and rear , makes this theme all too clear . The movie therefore presents pedophilic sentiments as normal and legitimate . Sorry , but a film on the lustful woes of a 40+ year old deranged assassin for a young 10-12 year old girl is n't worth a second look . The best performance in the film is by Gary Oldman who plays the corrupt police officer.Altogether a pretentious film that , due to its perverted theme , has absolutely no redeeming value . The plot itself is too absurd to be credible . Rent if if you must but I would n't buy it .	-1
When Hollywood finally chooses to make a movie about the struggles , it of course chooses to tell us that even though those nasty Prods have no problem killing our people in cold blood , obtaining the arms to fight back is wrong and must be stopped by Captain America aka Harrison Ford . Please spare me from this awful movie . Shades of Tom Clancy and the rest of the UK suck ups in Hollywood . How would they like it if Malibu was taken over by `` gasp '' republicans andresidency was limited to non-actors and they had to live in San Bernadino ?	-1
Not being a Brad Pitt fan period , I knew I was in for a real 'treat ' once I came to realize that he would be displaying his 'amazing ' acting skills with an Irish accent to boot . I knew this movie was doomed right then and there . And I was right . My goodness what an awful movie . I mean I ca n't even tell you wtf was going on cuz I was too busy being annoyed with/laughing at Pitts accent and all of the bad acting . Wow , never has a non comedy made me laugh so hard . Heck most comedies do n't even make me laugh this hard.Needless to say , I do n't know what happens in this movie , I do n't even think I could fall asleep to it . I think I actually turned it off , pissed off that I had wasted so much time ( 45 minutes ) watching this crapfest . On the good side , I now randomly laugh about this movie and tell people to rent it if they are ever in the mood to laugh at one of the worst movies ever.I really do n't know how this movie made it past the script stage of the game .	-1
If you are a big fan of Kenneth Branagh , you will love this film.This is a star studded movie version of Shakespeare 's romantic comedy by the same name . If you are a big fan of any of the stars in this movie version , you may love this film.If you have not seen many stage productions of Shakespearean plays or have previously found his plays inaccessible due to the Elizabethan language , you may love this film.If you are fond of scenic Italian locations , you may love this film.I have noticed that most reviewers do love this film . You will probably love it too since most people do . If it awakens in you a desire to see more Shakespeare , then I heartily approve.I did not like this film and I know I am in the minority . I have seen numerous stage productions of Shakespeare and I guess I am a Shakespeare purist . I found this film too slow-paced for me . Despite being early evening while watching it , it made me drowsy because I was bored , bored , bored . I have only been bored once before while watching a Shakespeare production . I found this film was an adaptation and not a faithful rending of this play unlike Shakespearean stage productions with which I am more familar . Despite being a fan of Emma Thompson , Keanu Reeves ( gasp ! ) , and some of the other stars ( but not Mr. Branagh ) , their presence did not make up for what I felt was lacking in this lavish production . Some of the stars seemed miscast.Please see Wikipedia synopsis for a detailed description of the plot of this play and the characters.Please see the IMDB for the casting of characters in this movie version after reading the Wikipedia synopsis.An interesting side fact : Dogberry in Shakespeare 's play is famous for his malapropisms . The word malaprop entered the English language more a century and a half later ( it did not exist in Shakespeare 's time ) . It came from Sheridan 's comedic play `` The Rivals '' and is based on the character of Mrs. Malaprop who delightfully mangles English . I like the sound of malapropism better than dogberryism for a word meaning mangled English . As a person who loves the English language , I am glad we waited a century and a half for Mrs. Malaprop to arrive and mint a new word that is used to this day .	-1
Ok the story as an absolute story is not bad , actually it 's somehow interesting . The animation is perfect and well done too . I think this is the best film ever for Will Smith ! Oh yes , and you may accept this movie as a light commedy.One of the main downfalls of this movie was that the Science Fiction side of the film was badly affected when the story got framed into commedy ! In other words , the suspense was dead ! Some of you are comparing this movie with Star Wars or Aliens ... I think this is not right ! Nor Star Wars or Aliens was a commedy ! Instead the suspense was very genuine and the movie turned out to be very powerful Science Fictions ! Anyway , this movie maybe worth seeing once or twice ... but I do not recommend buying it unless you are a big fan of Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones !	-1

I am a huge DVD fan , Scream 3 , ID4 , T2 and Fight Club have released outstanding DVD packages . This DVD however is a dud I am sad to say . The so called & quot ; extras & quot ; are hardly a token of fan appreciation for this film and I am wondering if studios actually think the buying public is nothing but a bunch of idiots . Studios constantly underestimate what the buying public wants which is why so many movies never make it to their full potential . Look at the Blair Witch Project or The Sixth Sense or any other movie every studio expected to see crumble . People know what they like and it appalls me to see that studios are becoming more and more chintsy involving & quot ; extras & quot ; with their DVD 's . Anyway , on with the DVD commentary , the picture quality is definately superior to the VHS version , however the widescreen version makes the picture quality during darker scenes much too dark and it 's hard to lighten the picture with your TV-stick with the standard format on this one . The sound quality is outstanding which is why I gave this DVD a 2 star instead of a 1 star-along with the fact Tommy Lee Jones is my favorite actor of all time . As far as extras , besides the stills , documentaries and music video , this DVD does n't really compare to the deluxe packages like the movies I just listed above . Part of what DVD is all about is getting more than just a movie , you 're getting the full interpretation of what the director originally wanted for the film . It 's obvious the studio had complete control over this one and Barry Sonnenfield should have included his & quot ; deleted scenes & quot ; since that 's what people are buying DVD 's for anyway . Every movie has deleted scenes-why not include them ? ? ? ! ! ! James Cameron is a master at this and it 's given his movies literally a second life for that very reason . Move on from this piece of trash and wait for the Star Wars Trilogy !	-1
Paul Verhoeven once again shows his incompetence as a director in this gory , tedious and all too predictable sci-fi yawn . The cast looks like something from Beverly Hills 90210 and their acting ability is equally bad . The characters are one-dimensional and boring . The only reason that I give this movie 2 stars is because it does hold some useful warnings against propaganda and glorification of war , which was also present in the Heinleins book . But as a whole I will not recomend this movie to anyone .	-1
If you are going to review a Blu-Ray movie , please describe the audio/video quality.Thanks R.Kevin Hill for explaining in detail how to get this movie to play . I just happened to have a male to female USB extension cable and a 256MB Flash Drive , which allowed the movie to play on my Sony Blu-Ray player ( the USB port is in a recessed port on the back of the player ) . What really stinks about this , is the fact that there is not an explanation of this requirement on the package , in big , bold letters . I did n't see it in the product description on Amazon either . It is a good thing I read the reviews , or I would have had no idea how to play this movie.At several times in the movie , there was a `` Do you want more information '' message , but I had no idea what to do to get more info . I tried `` Enter '' , the blue button , the red button , and directional keys . I 'm not sure if I got the extra info or not.The video quality was extremely good , 9.7 on a scale of 1-10 ( there were some scenes with some grain ) . One of the best Blu-Ray visual experiences I have had . The audio was good ( Dolby 5.1 TrueHD ) , but I did n't feel the sub-woofer bass was strong enough.This is a very gory movie - not for people who do n't like a lot of blood and guts .	-1
This movie will be a terrible disappointment to people that have read Heinlein 's book . The movie mangles the plot , ignores or misunderstands all of the ideas , and worst ( for an action picture ) leaves out all of the cool military hardware , arming the soldiers with what look like rejected weapons from the A-Team and armor from a high school football team.The commentary by Verhoeven and Edward Neumeier ( the screenwriter ) is illuminating -- neither of them have the slightest understanding of the book , and they keep repeating that the point of the movie is that `` war makes fascists of us all '' . Heinlein is not one of the more subtle writers , so I ca n't decide if they were so dumb they did n't get the book , or if they chose to ignore it . On the dumb side , they do n't understand plenty of things in their own movie ( such as why Denise Richards does n't come off as a `` career woman '' ) , and the plot details are absurdly incoherent ( the bugs shoot at spaceships by farting rocks into space , for instance , and somehow manage to do this over interstellar distances in very short periods of time ) . And I was n't able to find any points for the `` not dumb '' side.The acting is , for the most part , rotten . The male lead , Caspar Van Dien , has all the charisma of a blue jeans model ( which he might be for all I know ) , and Doogie Howser is really bad , too . Denise Richards is really pretty , but she 's rotten here . The only somewhat bright spot is Dina Meyer , but it is n't enough . All of the details about the society of which they are part are cartoonish and incosistent , and the special effects are lousy wit h the exception of some of the bug attacks . The actors look good naked in the shower scene , and that 's the high point of the movie.It 's a waste of time , and there are no armored suits , like those in the book , so do n't watch it hoping for an army of RoboCops ...	-1
As long as you dont take it too seriously this is not a bad flick . Its your typical 1990 's sci-fi with lots of special FX and ... .bugs , thousands of them , big yellow green blue horrible brain sucking mothers.Not for the faint-hearted . There is also the one-take-only co-ed shower scene in which the director had to firmly encourage his actors.A pleasant but brief interlude in an otherwise ordinary matinee movie.Not for the kids ...	-1
Like several of the negative reviewers , I also found that the disc would not play on my brand new Sony BDP 350 . First I 'd like to thank the reviewers here who explained the nature of the problem . For those as novice-y as I was , here 's the deal . On the back of your Sony , there is a recessed slot about 1 '' x0.5 '' with a USB port in it ( USB ports are probably also to be found on your computer ) . All that you need is a standard flash drive plugged in there , the same kind of flash drive commonly sold at drugstores ( I used a Duracell flash drive bought at Wallgreens ) . The only hitch is the recessed socket : it is just barely big enough to get a USB plug into it , but too small for some flash drives to fit ( i.e. , the plug will fit in the socket , but the casing the flash drive is in is too big for the hole the socket is mounted in ) . This is maddening but fixable too . If you can not get a flashdrive that is narrow and flat enough to fit in the hole ( many manufacturers are putting them in bigger cases for aesthetic reasons ) you can save the day with a male-to-female USB cable extension , which is what I did ( because I happened to have one around ) . You can probably get either a drive that fits , or if you already have one that does n't , the cable extension , at Radio Shack . Second , big thumbs down to Sony : they are responsible for the format , the player AND the film , and it 's inexcusable that their design required this -- everything should `` just work . ''	-1
I have bought several Starship Troopers/Blu-ray and none of them will play on my Sony Blue-ray player . Truly frustrating ! ! ! ! Got any suggestions ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I do n't get what 's so great about this movie . I found it to be a huge let down . This is an ultimately disappointing film despite good performances from all of the leads . The premise is simple , Jules and Mike have a passionate affair in their college days , this then becomes 'best friendship ' in no small part due to Jules commitment phobia . One day Jules gets a call from Mike to say that he is getting married in four days and inviting her to the wedding . At this point Jules realizes just how much she really loves Mike and determines to split-up Mike and Kim . The film follows her efforts to do this . However , at every turn she is thwarted by the happy couple who get back together.This film has the good grace to make Julia Roberts character finally admit that she behaved like a semi-psychopath , but even then that confession is wrapped in pseudo-romantic humour which implies : 'Aw , shucks , well that 's OK then . 'Unfortunately not really worth watching . A pity , because it could have been much better , with its unusual take as a non-feelgood romantic comedy .	-1
I like Julia Roberts just as much as anyone , however ... ..this movie was a whole other matter . It 's a contemptible premise played entirely for laughs.Julia Roberts ( as Julianne Potter ) , is soon turning 28 and once she learns her ex-boyfriend best friend ( Dermot Mulroney , as Michael O'Neal ) is getting married she plots to break up the nuptials and snag the old boyfriend for herself . Does she love him ? This is never clear . Is she capable of loving anyone other than herself ? Doubtful . But it does n't matter anyway because she 's desperate and she is a nasty schemer and that 's what this movie was all about : duplicity.I suppose they thought they were doing a screwball comedy so nothing really matters but getting the laughs . It certainly was n't a concern that from the outset they were equating deceit with romance . In essence , stating that whatever a person does to waylay someone else 's groom is not only to be lauded , it 's to be applauded.But really , why bother ? Let 's take the groom at face value . Here 's a guy who thinks nothing of constantly flirting with his ex-girlfriend ... .in front of the woman he 's pledged to marry . A guy who needed to use his ex-girlfriend for `` courage and support '' through what he obviously saw as troubled times as opposed to a joyous occasion . A guy who raved about his ex-girlfriend to everyone including his in-laws to be . A guy who helped humiliate his fianc & eacute ; e in a karaoke bar . A guy who yelled at his fianc & eacute ; e during a dinner causing her to become hysterical and still he yelled until she apologized for something that was n't her doing . A guy who , when finally told he was being manipulated by his ex , found the whole situation `` flattering ! '' So what if his fianc & eacute ; e was put through turmoil and stress she did n't deserve , as long as he kept getting his own way everything would be fine . He gets to have a wife , and , as his ex-girlfriend joked , they could always have affairs.It also was n't quite clear why Julianne Potter was so desperate to snag a guy she called an `` insensitive doofus . '' Had she forgotten the reason they broke up in the first place ? In the end , I could n't get past the character , Julianne Potter 's , behavior ( long enough to consider it funny ) . She commits both fraud ( with the phony email ) and a felony ( when she steals a van ) . Naturally , this being a romantic comedy neither has consequences . As for her final act of non-contrition : she `` loans '' the newlyweds THE song belonging to her and her ex . And no one saw the insult in that ? The only thing that keeps this woman from being a stalker is that she was invited into the festivities by her ex-boyfriend , who throughout the film kept sending mixed signals to both women.The thing that kept me from totally hating this movie was the extremely funny performance by Rupert Everett . Unfortunately , there was too little of him and way too much of Dermot Mulroney . I did enjoy the sing-a-long dinner party , it was a hoot . I also loved Cameron Diaz and the helium trio 's harmony . Actually , there were quite a few funny bits that did n't require bail and jail time . Still , I just could n't get past the underlining unsavoriness of the victimization involved , that it was meant to be funny , that so many people seem to enjoy such antics and overlooked them as harmless fun . I know this was only a movie , still , I just found it too disturbing and not a little repugnant.Of course I did n't keep it .	-1
This movie made me so angry I ca n't even begin to sum it up . Starring the cutest , sweetie pie bad actress of all time , Julia Roberts , in the cutest , sweetie pie backdrop ever , who turns it into a semi screwball comedy ( the one saving grace ) and an all out fest of shrewish behavior and jealousy.Julia Roberts plays her every woman self who is fretting over the arrival of her friend , Dylan McDermott , into her native Chicago . The two former flames have agreed that if they do not find someone to love by the age of 28 they will marry each other . The witching hour is approaching and she confides to her sassy gay man friend that she does n't want to go through with it . Imagine her surprise when she hears that McDermott has met the woman of his dreams , Cameron Diaz , and although it 's sudden has decided that she is in fact The One . And then what happens ? Is Julia Roberts relieved that she does n't have to join in this dreaded union ? Is she happy that McDermott is happy ? Of course not . In typical irrational female mentality , she becomes jealous and furious that he is not catering to her needs.The rest of this movie is a series of plots that Julia is attempting to put the kabosh on the wedding , which are mean spirited and self centered but are hidden thinly under some screwball comedy and hijinx . I was chanting `` Kill the bitch ! '' halfway into it.And that scene where she and McDermott are under the shadow of the bridge ? ! Where he 's talking about moments that you miss and things right in front of you , then when they come out from under the shadow of the bridge and he turns away . Was that supposed to be sentimental ? ! While everyone in the theater was in tears I was also because we were on the verge of two people actually making some kind of connection in this movie and we missed it ! Whoa to the chick flick genre.The one saving grace was Rupert Everett , the sassy gay friend . He was a gem and continues to be , even if it was a now somewhat typical role as the gay man companion to a lone strait woman . He was by far the funniest , and displayed the most talent . Cameron Diaz is n't bad either now that I think of it.The ending made me want to puke . After she reviels that she had been behind all the sabbatage , both Cameron and McDermott forgive her ? That 's just ridiculous . I 'd be too ashamed to look at myself in the mirror let alone at anyone else if I were behind all that . This was confirming the notion for women that it 's ok to be irrational , jealous and self centered .	-1
I 'm sorry but despite some brilliant acting performances from Hopkins and Thompson this has got to be one of the most BORING movies I 've ever tried to sit through . Do n't be fooled by artsy film snobs , this one is a snoozer . And oh by the way , the tenacious `` loyalty , devotion and integrity '' of Hopkins character that so many critics think is the cornerstone of the film , is in my opinion , distracting and ridiculous .	-1
`` Excess Baggage '' is the first project of Alicia Silverstone 's First Kiss production company . This tale of a fouled up `` kidnapping '' is definitely lightweight fare , with a minimal amount of substance . Unless you a really a fan of Alicia Silverstone or Benico Del Toro , you may want to pass on this one.Silverstone is Emily , a rich kid neglected by her father . Her plan is to fake her kidnapping , and win Daddy 's affection upon her safe return . He 's involved in some rather shady business deals , and can afford the ransom payment of a million dollars . Emily binds herself with tape , and locks herself in the trunk of her BMW . While waiting to be recovered by the police , the car is stolen by Vincent ( Del Toro ) a professional car thief . From this somewhat interesting premise not a lot happens that is either funny , or exciting.The movie attempts , but does not succeed in creating a warm and romantic relationship between the two leads . Failing to achieve this , we are left with a barely average comedy adventure . Silverstone 's performance does have some charm , and though her character is a bit odd , she rarely becomes irritating . She is a fashion casualty though . Unfortunately the chemistry with Vincent just does n't develop as intended . Vincent mumbles and bumbles , and seems none too bright . You watch him wondering just how weird he actually is . He never offends , but neither does he charm you . It just seems his brain is working in a lower gear most of the time , except when it comes to the subject of serving jail time , which definitely gets his full attention.Chris Walken is Emily 's Uncle Ray , a slick operator with an inflated opinion of himself , who never lives up to the hype . He works for Emily 's father , and has a better relationship with her than her own father . He looks into the kidnapping on his own , providing yet another odd character to watch.The conclusion is as unsatisfying as the rest of the movie . The kidnapping is somehow pinned on others , leaving Vincent in the clear . Though exactly how this is accomplished is never explained . That there is no happy reunion between father and daughter is no real loss . All Vincent 's other troubles have vanished , and he and Emily finish the movie together in the trunk of her car.I wanted to like this movie . With better writing , one could easily see how the `` Vincent '' role could have really been something special , and taken over the movie . Instead he 's just a harmless mumbler . Alicia Silverstone does a competent enough acting job , playing the spoiled misunderstood brat , trying ( sometimes too hard ) to bring out Vincent 's inner charm . It this case , it 's almost a lost cause .	-1
I 'm just tired of movies that have no individuality . They do n't even try to attempt something remotely original , and that seems down into their casting decisions . How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain ? Honestly , how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort ? Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those ` women who wish they were as powerful as men ' roles . That is the big issue with ` Air Force One ' , there is nothing original here . The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation . It does n't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really . The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed , but the tension just does n't live up upon multiple viewings , and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it is n't worth watching more than once .	-1
It may have seemed pretty good when it came out but in retrospect this is one lousy movie . Clearly high raters are rah rah Americans . Much overacting on almost everyone 's part . Harrison is just horrible . Actually he 's never been very good has he ?	-1
On this derivative , by-the-numbers thriller we are forced to believe that an US president ( played by Harrison Ford ) could actually take down a russian ( what else ? ) group of terrorists , as if he was 007 or McGyver . The beginning of the movie is somewhat credible , but soon presents us with one-dimensional characters and motivations , a lame and predictable plot and wooden , tepid acting . There are some twists , but they are so ridiculous and unbelievable that I stopped caring about it halfway through , given that the resolution has no surprises at all since the & quot ; good & quot ; guys always win . Despite some competent action sequences , this is brain-dead , mind-numbing material , cartoonish at best and completly disposable . There ` s no force to be found here .	-1
This is the kind of movie that should have never gotten to a studio once the script was written . It 's so fake and it would never happen.Harrison Ford is the president and he 's kidnapped aboard his plane by a terrorist Gary Oldman . He 's negotating for the release of some of his comrades to the vice president played by Glen Close . Ford wo n't give up without a fight and he 's determined to save his family and friends without Oldmans plans being met.The movie is so fake it 's sad . The plane would have been destroyed by pressure . It gets laced with 100 's of rounds of ammo . Come on you have to make is somewhat believable . Wolfgang Peterson should be slapped upside the head for putting something like that in a movie.Glen Close is horrible . Her dramatics are over the top . The fact that her character negotiates for the president is stupid . We do n't negotiate with terrorists and the fact that they put that in his dumb . It 's so fake.The refueling plane blowing up is dumb . There are so many saftey devices in place that would never happen like that . You have to mkae a movie at look least real if your trying to make an action drama like this and it 's not.Russia would never give up dangerous men either . They 'd tell us they felt bad for the president being in danger and would tell us to shove are demands where the sun do n't shine.This movie is way to fake . I could n't enjoy it because it would never happen . I enjoy action dramas and this is one of the worst ones I 've ever seen . If they had decided to make this more a drama and not so much action I might have been able to go along with it . The cast is awesome for the movie and a drama could have worked . The cast and talents are wasted . Why this made so much money I do n't know . I guess people are stupid enough to follow the story . Do n't waste your time or money on this one .	-1
The schlockmeisters , from Hollywood , have surpassed themselves with this offering . It needs more than suspension of disbelief to be entertained here , a full-frontal lobotomy is almost a prerequisite.It is so over-the-top and patently absurd in its action sequences that it actually ca n't rate as a movie in the genre of a thriller ; it 's more like a self-parody of an action movie . What 's missing is the canned laughter to give this movie some form of legitimacy and classification as to what the producer had in mind when he dished this up to the public.Yes , every respectable critic has alluded to the spraying of hundreds of rounds machinegun fire inside a pressurised cabin of a 747 , but what we have here is a President who 's a master of armed and unarmed combat ; an Avionics Engineer - a man adept at doing anything in a crisis situation . We can also add : the perfect , caring and reassuring father and husband ; maybe , we can include gynaecologist to his rather impressive list of credentials as well.This guy can hang outside a plane flying at 550mph at 38,000ft in -60 degrees Centigrade - if you 're not impressed with that , we also see him standing upright on the plane 's wing.Gary Oldman has played the arch villain once too often , his acting is becoming banal , predictable and synthetic ; it 's almost as if he does n't believe in his character anymore - he 's simply bored by the monotonous , one-dimensional , stereotyped role of the baddie.As for the role of Glenn Close as V.P . - she should know better . The scenes in the war room with the false sentiments of angst , anticipation , anxiety and , finally , overwhelming relief and joy ... ... it was cringingly awful.Somehow , I ca n't help but think , that those viewers who raved about this movie spend their vacation in the Grand Canyon searching for conclusive proof that the coyote is still chasing after the Roadrunner .	-1
When Russian terrorists posing as a news crew hijack Air Force One , the President himself is forced to save the day . It does n't get much more complex than that , which is a real shame because there was plenty more here to work with : a nice subtext about the politics of terrorism and American foreign policy ; a background power-play between the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense ; and even a conspiracy involving one of the President 's own staff . In the hands of a savvy writer/director like Phil Noyce or Rod Lurie or Michael Mann , this could have been that rarest of beasts - an action-thriller with something to say . Unfortunately , with Wolfgang Petersen at the helm it plays more like an episode of `` Thunderbirds '' . The A-list cast is squandered : Gary Oldman plays another ridiculous villain ; Glenn Close unfortunately reprises her comedic role from `` Mars Attacks ! '' Only Ford is truly convincing . He 's particularly well-cast as President Jim Marshall , because the role requires precisely what Ford can always be relied on to give , in every guise from Jack Ryan to Richard Kimble to Indiana Jones : the slightly fearful , slightly bumbling heroics of an ordinary guy forced to do extraordinary things . He 's great , and the scenes in which he 's fighting for his life in the cargo hold are the movie 's best moments , not least because Petersen 's particular talent seems to be for staging tense action sequences in confined settings . But it 's not enough . The whole picture is ultimately undone by its dogged insistence on taking itself seriously . Andrew W. Marlowe 's script is utterly devoid of humour and contains some memorable clangers : `` I 'm countin ' on you , red white and blue ... '' , and the utterly cringe-worthy , `` GET OFF MY PLANE ! '' . Jerry Goldsmith 's insufferably chipper score , which seems specifically crafted to induce some kind of patriotic swoon , obliterates most of the realism from any scene , and what remains is shot down by the ludicrously inept special effects . One is almost tempted to read film this as Wolfgang Petersen 's tongue-in-cheek Hollywood calling card . `` You want me , a German , to demonstrate my allegiance by making patriotic Hollywood crap ? Sure , I can do that . Just watch me . '' He certainly knows his market . Never ones to demand any connection between the Presidency and reality , locals coughed up close to $ 200m for this - which is hilarious until you remember they vote .	-1
You take an once great martial-arts actor , adds a basketball player who seems to be destroying his sports career by his own freewill , takes another actor who , by his own freewill , almos destroyed his own face going prize fighting ( Rourke ) , then apparently takes a six-year old kid to write a script , and you have as result this & quot ; movie & quot ; .	-1
This Van Damme thriller is such a mixed bag that it 's hard to know where to begin . The plot is truly a witches ' brew of ideas apparently cobbled together from just about every action thriller I 've seen in the past 20 years . That would n't be so bad , except that the original movies did it better and this movie suffers by comparison . The script is n't terrible , but it 's far from stellar . The actors struggle valiantly to extract some inspiration and drama from it , and sometimes succeed . I note one reviewer says this movie is on his top 10 worst list , and if it were n't for the unintentionally funny parts like former pro-basketball star Dennis Rodman throwing bad guys through windows 10 feet high as if he were dunking a basketball I probably would n't have watched the whole thing . But Rodman as an exotic arms dealer and Mickey Rourke as the evil Euro-nasty are entertaining to watch , and Van Damme is impressive as usual with the martial arts stunts . But if there 's anything else on the tube rated three stars or higher you might want to switch channels .	-1
All three major Irish dance films suffer from the inability of whoever is doing the filming to film dance properly ! This is the greatest abuser of the three . There are three major problems : 1 ) not filming the dancers full body , 2 ) stage lighting ( not the best for filming , though fine for viewing a live performance ) , and 3 ) excessive changes in camera angle . Of these three , the second is forgiveable , being unavoidable if one is filming before a live audience but one and three are not ! As to one , there was extensive work done by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in the early days of the musical that worked out the best ways to film dance . Only one completely ignorant of filming technique would fail to film full body . As for three , I can tell you that there are nine cameras in New York 's Radio City Music Hall . How do I know ? BECAUSE THE FILMOGRAPHER SWITCHED CAMERAS EVERY 10-15 SECONDS OF EVERY FLIPPING DANCE ! HELLO , we do not ALL watch an excessive quantities of MTV , thank you very much ! This is distracting at best and at worst it totally disrupts the ability to appreciate the flow of the movement . Additionally , if you 've already seen the Michael Flatley film there is very little of interest or improvement ( unless you dislike his work , in which case you may like this ) . The only major change is a & quot ; dance down & quot ; pitting American tap against Irish step . This particular number , were it film properly , would be worth the price of adding this work to your collection , even if it already included the original & quot ; Riverdance & quot ; , but , as it is , forget it ! Rent it on video , see the number , and forget wasting you well-earned money on this forgetable turkey . The performers worked hard and I am sorry that those filming them did n't give their effort the presentation it deserved .	-1
I saw this film on the new release shelf . Vincent D'Onofrio , Salma Hayek . Looks quirky and fun . It 's not . First of all , the most interesting character is killed off in one of the first scenes . Then , we are left with the other characters moping around and making out . I found it hard to distinguish any story at all , and by the last reel , the film made me wanting to take a shower , badly .	-1
too esoteric for me	-1
A great sci-fi movie but this is a terrible transfer ( there was apparently no attempt to clean up the master before the transfer to HD ) ; my Superbit version of the movie upscaled by my Blu-Ray player looks much , much better.Sony will be releasing an new version with better picture quality sometime soon ; they are also working on a program to trade in this poor version for some kind of credit/refund when you buy the new one .	-1
I found this movie to be a deadly bore ... I had to watch it in a biology classUma Thurman is gorgeous in this film	-1
This film has lots going for it - a fine soundtrack ( Michael Nyman ) , some interesting sets , even Uma Thurman . . . But it is fantastically dull.The basic premise , outlined in detail elsewhere , has been far more entertainingly explored in films like Blade Runner , and 'The Boys from Brazil'.If you 're seeking some intelligent dystopia , try 'Brazil ' - or if you 're really highbrow , read 'The Man in the High Castle ' , or 'Brave New World'.I hate to slag off a film that has so much going for it ( it is good to see Alan Arkin and Gore Vidal up there on the silver screen ) , but to be honest , I found this lacking in any depth whatsoever . I can hear the groans from here , but I found 'Paycheck ' a lot more thought-provoking . . .	-1
Some information in the `` Product Details '' section for the non-Superbit DVD release of `` Gattaca '' may cause confusion as to whether this issue includes a widescreen ( 2.35:1 ) presentation . The `` Format '' section lists the available presentation as `` Full Screen '' ( i.e . `` Pan & Scan '' for any widescreen theatrical movie ) , while the `` Aspect Ratio '' section lists a 2.35:1 ( widescreen ) aspect ratio . To clear things up , the theatrical presentation is widescreen ( 2.35:1 ) , but the DVD presentation is pan & scan ( 1.33:1 ) , not widescreen . It says so on the back of the DVD case cover insert . The Superbit DVD release of `` Gattaca '' includes a widescreen presentation at a heftier price .	-1
I 'm writing this review mainly to tell everyone who is n't in love with Brad Pitt that this movie was good at all . I felt as if I 'd spent seven years somewhere during this movie , seven years somewhere boring . The movie had about as much plot as pigs have wings . The movie centers around Brad Pitt 's character who is neither likable or really that interesting . His relationship with the Dalai Lama in this movie which was originally what the studios used to sell this movie is barely a sideline . The movie was so bad that Battlefeild Earth looks like Star Wars in comparison . I hope all you ladies out there wo n't drop your ... to see yet another Brad Pitt washout . If you REALLY want to see Brad Pitt by Legends of the Fall or Fight Club now those two movies were excellent .	-1
Some movies are just bad . Like , there is nothing redeeming about them , they are just outright bad . ` Striking Distance ' is one of those movies . The script is ridiculous , preposterous and clich & eacute ; d. The acting is terrible from everyone on board and the action , while suitable , is nothing of particular note . From opening sequence to closing kiss , this movie is just BAD.It 's a shame , because I tend to like the cast , or at least parts of it , and Willis , while gravitating towards tired cop thrillers in the early stages of his career , was able to bring an intensity and freshness to most of them . Not this one though . From his melodramatic performance to Brion James nauseating presence to the screenplays consistent stupidity ( from the actions of the police officers to the unraveling of the plot to the tacked on love interest ) , ` Striking Distance ' is one of the worst films this genre has ever offered us . Robert Pastorelli camps it up beyond belief in a performance I ca n't really even describe , it is that bad.I do n't want to spoil the film for any of you who actually want to see this , but I do n't think I 'll ever be able to take a film seriously that can not even attempt to give the characters an ounce of professionalism . The police force as a whole is portrayed as a group of no-brained , conscienceless scoundrels who are as dumb as they are cruel . The turnabout that these characters undergo at the end , especially Farina 's character ( like , now you care ? And why exactly ? What is so different about what he 's doing now and what he 's already done ? ) makes no sense at all.That 's this film 's biggest problem , it just makes no sense , does n't try to fails to do anything worth remembering .	-1
In my book , the very worst films are the ones that take a lot of talented people , all of whom have done great work elsewhere , and deliver them into a cinematic meatgrinder . `` Battlefield Earth '' is one such film , and `` Striking Distance '' is another.This film manages to completely waste Bruce Willis , Sarah Jessica Parker , Dennis Farina , Tom Sizemore , Robert Pastorelli , Brion James , and Andre Braugher , all of whom are tremendous actors who 've done fine work elsewhere . But in `` Striking Distance , '' it seems that they were all in it for a paycheck , and little else.When bad movies are filled with hack actors , and were obviously done on a nonexistent budget , at least you know the movie could n't have been better.But when you have a bomb like this populated with this kind of talent , and obviously the product of a serious budget , the problem is that the people making it just did n't give a darn .	-1
C'mon , guys ! ! ! This is the age of DVD & quot ; extra-mania & quot ; with every sort of outtake , alternate scene , missing scene , lost scene , director 's cut , , etc etc being an ESSENTIAL part of a film 's legacy as preserved in the DVD format.In the case of the moving and powerful & quot ; Requiem & quot ; ( and I agree with the customer who feels that the Jackie Gleason/Julie Harris staircase scene belongs at the top of the all-time list of great movie scenes ) , the film was obviously released in several different versions.The confusion begins , in fact , immediately after the staircase scene . There are AT LEAST THREE SCENES from the latter part of the film that are NOT INCLUDED on the DVD:1 . ) Gleason 's encounter with the vile Ma Greeny in the hallway when he tells her he 'd & quot ; like to run into her when you 're not grafted to that torpedo ... & quot ; ( referring to her big thug/bodyguard ) .2 . ) A lengthy ( and painful ) scene where Quinn is training to be a wrestler , and the moronic Pirelli ( Stan Adams , the only actor to reprise his role from the 1956 TV original version ) signals Quinn 's wrestling partner to intentionally gouge his bad eye , whereupon Quinn beats the crap out of the guy ... ..3 . ) Gleason 's final speech on the rotten world of Prize Fighting which he delivers to the young wanna-be ... ..If Serling ultimately wanted these scenes cut , WHY IN THE WORLD were they ot included as EXTRAS ? ? ? I have old video copies of late-night , local TV airings of this film that are FAR MORE COMPLETE than this state-of-the-art DVD release.What a pity -- -to see such a cool film treated so poorly ( the audio is also very low on this disc ; I had to jack the TV volume all the way up to get a decent signal ) .	-1

Little more than an excuse to exploit the success of the Spice Girls , Spice World is a grossly lacking film , even for those who enjoy the music . Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles `` A Hard Days Night '' , the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized . A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members ca n't save the film from its own bad dialogue , poor choreography and painful lip-syncing . Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth ( Alan Cumming ) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project , a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls : Ginger ( Geri Halliwell ) , Baby ( Emma Bunton ) , Posh ( Victoria Beckham ) , Sporty ( Melanie Chisholm ) and Scary ( Melanie Brown ) . While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice , the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England . Meanwhile , their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief ( Roger Moore ) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers , or a caress of his squealing bovine . And if that is n't enough , a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines . To top it all off , a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives , which as it turns out , is basically the very movie we 're watching.Since the story of the film is largely pointless , and little else really holds attention spans , it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that do n't quite add up . For starters , the girls drive around in the Spice Bus , a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior . So impossibly large in fact , that it does n't even pretend to make sense . Workout equipment , couches , beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus , in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus . And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows , even though the realism has long since been abandoned.While each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions , physiques and attitudes , those characteristics do n't translate over to their personalities . Either they were all scripted to be ditzy , or they 're just naturally that way . Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios , most of which are intended as comedy relief , despite the blatant absence of humor . Similarly , the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations , and they 're choreographed with little self-respect , and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing . Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life , and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles , an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.With brief appearances by Elton John , Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits , a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure , and countless attempts at failed humor , Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group . And even entertaining those fans is debatable . When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off , it 's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.- Mike Massie	-1
This is not so spicy as the groups music is . I love the Spice Girls music but when I saw Spice World ... I thouht that I may not even LISTEN to them no more much less WATCH them . This movie , while being spicy and sorta on the verge , was not what I expected . When I saw it in theathers I though it was a really good movie . So good that I ACTURALLY bought the movie on VHS and then updated to DVD . I watched it on VHS and it was okay but when I popped in the DVD ... it lost it 's magic . First off ... a few things where wrong with the dvd.1 . ) Quality - The picture was great . Clear and perfect . The only problem with the picture was it was too dark to even see who was who.2 . ) Music - Could n't they had put more felling into the music and acturally , I do n't know , sing for once . I know you lip-sing in music videos but , if you really want to get the crowd going and yelling for a sequel or another Spice movie , just sing and do n't be scared and stupid as lets say , Britney Spears is.3 . ) Special Feautures - There were only 2 special features on the disc at all . People usually upgrade to DVD 's for the special features . Am I right ? ? Of course I Am ! This movie , while being sporty and spicy , this is not a movie I would recommend you upgrade to DVD . If you have the VHS ... keep it . Do n't upgrade to the DVD . Your just wasting your money ! Read my other DVD reviews and listen to my advice . It 's the best on this website !	-1
Love the story , not the cussing.Was a little disappointed , had to get rid of it.Ca n't they make movies with out using Gods name every time .	-1
I 've seen this movie . Even with Tom Hanks , Jon Lovitz and Geena Davis staring in it . I just could n't enjoyed it . I found that both Madonna 's character and Rosie O'Donnell 's character were just flat awful . It took away from the movie , itself .	-1
My husband needed this for his writing class that is the only reason it was purchased . I would never ever allow any children to watch this movie or even listen to it . Hollywood and the child actors ' seems to ruin these young actors ' with filth like this . This will never be watched by any children , teenagers or even adults in my home . It is just that horrible . I was shocked to hear their mouths and see the characters in action . It is an insult to those who have and hold morals .	-1

Viewed : 9/12Rate : 19/12 : If you need a reason to proclaim that Chick Flicks Suck , look no further than Stool Boognolias . Clearly , the film is among the worst of the genre . Instead of one , there are six prima donnas in the cast : Julia Roberts , Olympia Dukakis , Sally Field , Dolly Parton , Daryl Hannah , and Shirley MacLaine . Every one of them has a string behind their backs , and each pull will have them screaming , `` Look at me ! Look at me ! I am the Queen of the South ! '' again , again , and again . It literally is that the entire film . The six Amanda Wingfields are thoroughly theatrical as they can possibly be , further ruining the film . Really , this Disease Movie of the Week Stool Boognolias is a rip-off from Terms of Endearment which is the better film by a mile . The whole storyline is conceptually the same as the other film with the same predictable ending . Of the cast , Daryl Hannah looks completely ridiculous and shows why she has no business acting in the first place . Dolly Parton , wow ... she became famous for one and only one thing , and it was not even her singing . Sally Field , she has done better in other films . Olympia Dukakis , she is like , `` Look at me ! I am Ol-l-l-y-y-y-m-m-p-i-i-i-a Duk-ak-i-i-i-i-s ! '' Ah , Shirley MacLaine ... I 've always hated her since she first appeared on The Trouble With Harry . I wo n't be surprised that she slept her way into Hollywood . No acting talent either . Finally , the worst of the worst ( well , Shirley is really the worst ) , Julia Roberts nabs the nomination with her `` I can make puffy faces and cry on cue ! '' and `` This is ABOUT ME ! DAMN IT ! '' Horrible ... horrible ... horrible . Above all is the strong misguided feminist message the movie sends out to the audience . Uh , that 's called `` brainwashing . '' All in all , I hate Stool Boognolias and , more importantly , its cast of six prima donnas with passion .	-1
People tell me I am the spitting image of a young Robert Redford so I usually go out of my way for his movies . This one did n't have much substance , though . It 's about a baseball player in the 1800 's that is shot in the chest by a stray bullet and continues to play in a baseball game . Due to an electrical failure and a defective baseball , the game is halted and his team is granted the win to much fanfare . There is also a subplot with some woman ... possibly a lukewarm love affair . I did not pay much mind to those parts so I ca n't recall every detail of it .	-1
The Bottom Line : A baseball movie that knows nothing about the sport ( Roy Hobbs is a pitcher the first time we see him and , inexplicably , a slugging right fielder the next time he 's on screen ) and attempts to impose a larger-than-life mythological feel on a simple story that manifestly can not support it , The Natural is an overlong , overrated , and unenjoyable film that did n't even have the guts to follow its source novel to the dark conclusion the plot warrants.2/4	-1
God love Terry Gilliam : a brilliant moviemaker and animator whose heart is always in the right place . Terry intended this as a homage/tribute to the brilliant Czech animator Karel Zeman , whose earlier version of the Munchausen fable is still the definitive one . This version , though well-meant , is done in by too much budget and too many 'Spot-The-Star ' moments . Anybody looking to really exercise that 'sense-of-wonder ' should hunt down Zeman 's version : despite its poor characterizations , mainly post-synch sound and general narrative torpor , it 's truly unforgettable and the reason Gilliam became an animator in the first place . Though Gilliam 's 'Baron ' is clever and generally watchable , it too suffers from narrative torpor - which is harder to excuse with a $ 40- million budget .	-1
I had been wanting to see this movie for the past two years , and I finally got the chance . Surprisingly , I found it to be a real letdown . It focuses on the life of a teenage girl named Dedee , who visits her half-brother in Indiana , after her stepfather dies . Soon upon arrival , she seduces her brother 's gay live-in lover , then later tells him that she is pregnant with his child . From that point on , Dedee spreads bad luck to those around her . Even though some of the actors/actresses played their roles very well , I did not like the flow of the movie . Overall , I thought that it was pretty boring , and I did not like it .	-1
`` American Pop '' is Ralph Bakshi 's best film ... that 's not saying much considering this man also assaulted us with `` Fritz the Cat , '' the animated `` The Lord of the Rings , '' `` Wizards , '' and the really awful `` Hey Good Lookin ' . `` The story follows four generations of a Russian immigrant family , and their cosmic involvement in their respective worlds of popular music . Jimmy is a vaudevillian who gets shot in the throat in WWI and must manage the career of his singer wife . He also gets involved with the mob thanks to prohibition . His son , Benny , is a piano genius who is killed is WWII . Benny 's son is the misfit Tony , who we follow from the Beat generation to a drug induced 1970 's . Tony 's one night stand product , Pete , continues the drug trade , but can belt out one mean tune in the punk rock late 1970's.Bakshi 's animation still consists of tracing live action onto film as animated subjects . This makes for some really jerky scenes , although not on the headache inducing level of his earlier work . There are a few places where the work is downright interesting , like Tony 's acid trip and eventual fall from a stage , and Pete 's dancelike movements as he delivers his drugs to his customers.Bakshi 's biggest mistake is using well known songs in the soundtrack , and attributing them to cartoon characters . Pete writes `` Night Moves . '' Benny comes up with `` As Time Goes By '' after stealing the riff from a hobo . Tony wrote `` Somebody to Love . '' I found this angle of the film irritating . It is not like no one has ever heard of these songs , and would be fooled . It just seems as if the film makers were too lazy to come up with their own material , and the songwriters and publishing houses were too eager to sell their stuff for a quick buck . Since the entire film consists of this one family coming up with all the great songs of the last eighty years , toss any suspense out the window as to what each generation is going to accomplish.Bakshi is also obsessed with the illegal drug culture in the final half of the film . What is this , `` Panic in Needle Park '' ? Watching cartoon characters shooting heroin is bizarre , but pointless . I ask the same question I ask of some of Bakshi 's other work , specifically `` Hey Good Lookin ' , '' why did he animate this ? Why did n't he shoot this with live actors ? The animation , while interesting , is completely unwarranted.In the end , `` American Pop '' is as homogenized and half baked as much of the music coming out today . Then again , I 'd rather watch Britney Spears cavort in low riding jeans than sit through this music mondo mockumentary again . `` American Pop '' has left the building , do n't bring it back next year.This is animated , but rated ( R ) for physical violence , strong gun violence , gore , profanity , brief female nudity , sexual references , strong drug abuse , and strong drug references .	-1
The animation is good , especially considering when it was made , but & quot ; American Pop & quot ; is never quite successful . Once again Bakshi probes the sordid underbelly of his subject , in this case pop music , but nothing here ever comes off quite convincing enough . And his dismissal of punk and rush to embrace the bland beardo post-hippie commercial rock of Bob Seger and Heart betrays Bakshi 's age , and maybe a lack of good taste as well . It comes off a bit old-fogeyish.Like a lot of Bakshi 's work , this has to be taken as it is , and the viewer has to bear in mind when and how it was made . Computer animation was in its infancy , and animation was at a low point in the United States , so the fact that this was made and distributed in mainstream theaters at all was a minor miracle at the time.In short , the musical spots provide the bright moments , but the plot is labored and the characters , particularly the ridiculous & quot ; rock star & quot ; he invents at the end of the film , are unconvincing . As a historical document of where animation was in the United States at the time , it 's viewable ; as entertainment , well , it 's better than & quot ; Heavy Traffic & quot ; but certainly not any kind of a classic animated film . See it if you want , but it 's not indispensable .	-1
No Mercy is one of those films that is not really that bad , but it leaves you wondering how did they get big stars to do it . In the film Richard Gere plays a tough New York cop with a drinking habit , an ex-wife , and a bad rep . So what happens to him ? Well his good natured partner ( you know the one with the with the wife and kids and a good reputation a.k.a has everything to lose ) gets murdered when Gere takes a tip from a local hood that a hit is about to go down . So the film turns into the rouge cop on the revenge trail story . This will bring him to New Oreans ( that whole & quot ; fish-out-of-water & quot ; thing ) , and to Kim Basinger . Along the way Gere will encounter lots of bad guys , bullets , cops who do n't like him , swamps , crawfish , and cajons ( sp ? ) all to a hip 80 's soundtrack.This film was the first pairing of Richard Gere and Kim Basinger together and to it 's credit it is better than there second film , Final Analysis . However there really is n't much going on here . The plot was as predictable as traffic at five o'clock . Neither Gere nor Basinger is very good which is Richard Pearce 's ( the director ) fault because they fall in and out of their accents . I have to say though there is something about Richard Gere that even in his weaker films , like this one , he is still fun to watch . The same can be said for Basinger who is always delightful on the eyes even when she is hard on the ears.This film has it 's momments , but they are pretty sparse . Maybe Richard and Kim will get it right on the third try since they seem to like doing this type of film together . If you 're out there looking for some steamy action you might want to look elsewhere .	-1
Vincent Gallo is strange . The characters here are all strange . Kevin Pollack is interesting and surprising and you will feel genuine sympathy for his wife . Kiefer Sutherland is not interesting or surprising , and you will get tired of him quickly , just like everyone else in the film . Predictable film and all too long for me .	-1
The Juror starring Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin looked like such an entertaining thriller but this movie is just so stupid . I could n't believe how dumb the plot and ending was . And who the hell what 's to see Anne Heche naked ? not me ! One of the worst movies I have ever seen , use this one as a coaster .	-1
You see this a lot . A sci-fi movie ( or rather direct to video release ) comes along with a very compelling premise and even an interesting plot , but in the end fails to meet the expectations set by what makes the idea so great in the first place . I watch Screamers and I see a fascinating idea from the events unfolding in the movie . However by the time the movie ends I have to ask myself , `` there has to be a way to do this better ... much better . '' This is pretty much where Screamers sits . Good stuff mired in not so good stuff.What 's good about Screamers ? It 's based on the short story , Second Variety by Philip K Dick , which itself has been named a very influencial and critically acclaimed writing . So the background story is this : A corporation and their previous employees wage war on each other on a planet based on disputes over how to reclaim some valuable resources . The ex-workers , who named themselves The Alliance , created intuative robots to help in the fights . Eventually the robots end up wiping out both sides until there is hardly anybody left . Not a bad start . The film is essentially about a group of Alliance soldiers making their way to a company outpost to hammer out a truce , but those pesky robots ( called Screamers ) have their own plans . Most of the major plot points from that premise are rock solid on paper , and would make for some really cool scenes . However ... ... on to the bad about Screamers . As good an idea as the plot if you ca n't take the viewer there and get them to really absorb what 's going on then your film will fall flat . This is what happens . We get to a rather interesting and major plot twist that wraps up pretty much what the movie is about , but you would n't know it by seeing those scenes . It just moves with the kind of pacing you would expect from a scene with little importance to the plot . That how most of the scenes feel . Just a little exposition or action that does n't feel tied to the story . Characters come up as one dimensional with rather pointless traits that do n't lead anywhere . Some twists seem to come out to build suspense but really feel like they were dropped into the story with very little to allow them to make any sense . So a great idea is held back by poor planning in both the script and direction.As far as the technical side of the film is concerned I really have little to complain about considering this is likely a low budget release . The sets range from impressive to quite believeable . The post apocalyptic look is consistent . The special effects are serviceable too . I liked the stop motion animation work they used and was impressed by how well it blended with the rest of the film . The violence end of the special efffects work pretty well without getting into the gory side of things . Acting ... well I ca n't complain . Good actors do good and some actors overact , but sometimes I have to defer that to how the director leads them.The DVD is pretty bare bones with just a movie trailer and language options as your extras . The picture was clean , but I have an issue with the 5.1 dolby digial audio . It just seems the dialog took a major back seat to the surround audio effects and explosions . More than once I had to turn up the volume just to hear the mumblings of the actors only to turn it down again because some robot is screaming ( guess why the movie is titled such ? ) or some other audio queue comes blaring out much louder than normal . As low a rating I give to this film I still think die hard sci-fi fans should at least give it a rental so they can at least ponder what the movie was trying to accomplish . The rest you may want to go ahead and give this one a pass . It 's not scary or gory enough for horror and suspense fans . It 's not intense enough for action junkies .	-1
First off , Robert DeNiro as the monster . I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone . They did n't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York . Second , Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story . Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous . Frankenstien 's shock that she 's not happy to be back -- burnt up , cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest -- was supposed to be touching but I laughed . We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really , really , really bad.I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn 's face .	-1
With the exception of Campbell Scott ` s convincing acting , this movie has little or nothing to offer . This is supposed to be a suspenseful mistery about what people seem to be and what they really are , a subject that is presented in most of director David Mamet ` s films . However , the plot is contrived at best , the pacing drags endlessly and the characters are just tepid and souless , excepting the lead that somewhat makes the viewer care a bit . The acting is also far from excellent and the direction does nothing to improve the slowness of the movie . The plot twists are quite irrelevant too , since the story is so uninteresting . & quot ; The Spanish Prisoner & quot ; is just another forgettable and useless movie about cons and burglars , and it ` s as bad as & quot ; Heist & quot ; , another Mamet film that goes nowhere and also fails to engage.A good one to ignore .	-1
Casting against type can be very effective . Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity is a good example . Raymond Burr in Rear Window is another . Steve Martin as a heavy is not . Two things that never below together in any film : Steve Martin , and a gun.And Martin 's the best thing about this film .	-1
Nothing about this movie works.Dialogue : About five minutes into this film , I realized that the bad dialogue and horrible delivery was intentional . It was too consistent . ALL the characters used odd turns of phrases and words more commonly found in print than spoken aloud . That 's OK when you do it convincingly ( hardly ever in real life do I hear someone yell `` YOU SHALL NOT PASS ! ! ! ! '' but in a fantasy film , it works ) . When you do it without conviction or use it as a lame attempt to immitate 1940 's film noir , it just sounds stupid.Plot : Plot holes you can drive a truck through abound in this film . Biggest and most obvious is `` why go to all the bother of tricking someone into doing something when you could have just stuck a gun in his back and forced him to do it ? '' Just about every element of this ridiculous ruse has the same problem : They all rely on `` chance '' occurances that could n't reasonably be arranged to happen . From step one ( the sea plane landing ) to the final act ( the pseudo-japanese tourists being on exactly the right water taxi out of hundreds of others ) , the audience is asked to believe that these staged coincidences are possible . They 're not , and so the film becomes unconvincing from start to finish.Setting : Is it 1940 's film noir ? Is it the 90 's ? Is this some sort of Jimmy Buffet island theme mystery gone sour ? Hard to tell . Oddly enough , it almost appears intentionally so . The potential gains from the formula are written on a blackboard but not shown to the audience . Phones look modern ( for the 1990 's ) , but you still have secretaries dialing for execs . I 'm not sure when `` get me [ name here ] on the phone , Dolores '' went out of style , but it was definitely before the 90's.Costuming : so/so . No real issues here , other than it 's a little ambiguous.Cinematography : My biggest beef . If you 're going to do a 1940 's film noir knock-off , film it in grainy B & W ; or at least work the camera angles better . L.A. Story et alia do a much better job of evoking the period and the genre . There were a few half-hearted attempts ( the focus on the sunshine bakery bag , for example ) , but none accomplished much more than making me wonder why they bothered.Misc : - The use of the carousel was an obvious nod to The Sting . Unfortunately , this movie had none of the campy believability of that classic.- The female lead was a bad pick . Steve Martin made a decent attempt to carry the bad dialogue , but she just cranked out each monotone wooden line one after the other as if people anywhere or anywhen had actually spoken in that fashion . It would be hard for one actress to ruin a film , but she gives it an old college try.- The lead character makes a big deal over the fact that his formula is locked in a safe- but then leaves it scribbled on a blackboard covered only with a curtain .	-1
There are some enjoyable scenes . Steve Martin is very good . Unfortunately the movie is frustrating and extremely manipulative . In the end you feel used and abused .	-1
Not having seen all of Mamet 's film 's it would be unfair to say he 's made only two good ones : `` House of Games '' and , especially , `` The Winslow Boy '' . We just watched an intermittently interesting but ultimately mediocre Mamet effort , `` Heist '' , so I went to Amazon.com to read some reviewers ' opinions . The awarding of stars was more evenly divided than any set of reviews for any film I 've checked . More interesting than that , however , was the fact that so many reviewers of `` Heist '' mentioned `` The Spanish Prisoner '' as an example of Mamet 's better work . We have seen `` The Spanish Prisoner '' twice , the second time to try to find something that we might have missed the first time . Still do n't get it . It is surface only , and an uninteresting surface at that . There 's no apparent involvement on the part of the players/characters and little or no reason for the viewer to become involved either . The one extra star above the minimum merely means it was n't offensive enough to hate .	-1
Minnie Driver is horribly miscast as the lead in this film , in as much as her on-screen appearance is neither friendly , nor inviting ( in the future she should also shy away from anything that involves her getting ` wet ' argh ! -I ca n't Even imagine watching `` Hard Rain '' ) . As the Annabella Sciorras , and the Emma Thompsons before her , Ms. Driver will have to quickly accept the fact that she has little to offer in a role that is supposed to ` carry ' a film . She just has not the acting skills , nor the on-screen magic that someone like Kate Winslet or Gwyneth Paltrow has , nor has she the energy or effervescence that , say Rose McGowan has.I grabbed the film for Tom Wilkinson anyway , having recently become quite the fan of this British J.T . Walsh . A wonderful character actor who has raised his profile in the US significantly of late with appearances in `` Shakespeare in Love '' , `` The Full Monty '' , and `` Sense and Sensibility '' .The story fails even the Driver-factor , ambling on like one of those scripts developed in a screen-writing class : ` who has an idea ? ' ` how about a young Jewess loses her money and has to take on work in Scotland in the 1800s ' ` good , but we need some conflict in the first act ' ... 'maybe she falls for the master of the house , but the son has eyes for her as well ' ... 'good ' ... you know the rest.And it goes from bad to worse . It 's impossible to complete this puzzle with so many ill-fitting pieces .	-1
I was very interested in seeing `` The Governess '' and fairly lept at the opportunity to do so when my friend Marion suggested it . What a disappointment ! Have n't been so let down since `` Murder on the Orient Express '' as a child.What 's the matter ? The major problem is that there 's just too much crammed into the movie as plot devices . Why not deal with just a few circumstances , than have all this tumult which in the end , does n't even signify ? Interesting premise in a nutshell description : A 19th century Jewish woman must conceal her religion as she takes up a governess position . That 's how it was presented , and frankly , that 's enough . No , how about her father gets murdered in the street ! Well , that was shocking , but what of it ? It never got solved , it never figured in the rest of the movie . I mean , he could have just , you know , died . Why murdered ? Then she goes off to the dreariest place in all of Scotland . The master of the house keeps trying to make early photographs . The Governess takes it upon herself to solve his problems developing film by dumping salt in his solutions . Hey what do you know , he evidently gets credited as the inventor of the photograph , when it was really The Governess . Well , what about that ? Could n't that be a good feminist statement in and of itself ? No , let 's begin a torrid , somewhat unmotivated affair . Then she takes nude photos of him for a change . Uh-oh , that 's the limit , too vulnerable a position for a man . Finally , she 's off to London again as a photographer in her own right , and guess who walks into the salon ... ? Enough already.I just found it more preposterous as it went on . I was more than willing to accept some off-the-beaten-track developments , but this was aimless messing about . No motivation or follow-through.Take a lesson from me ; avoid `` The Governess '' .	-1
Another movie about a young girl ( a servant ) who moves into a rich British family 's house and messes around with the husband ( and the son ) . Nothing original or emotional about it . Just gratuitous sex . Once again , just like several other movies I have seen , this is a movie about a British girl who 's dad dies and she has to go to work to help the family . So that is how she ends up with the rich British family to begin with . But the twist ( and the reason I gave it one star . . . if I could have given it a minus star I would have ) is that this girl is a Jewish girl from a Jewish family in London . She knows from the job advertisement that the family is very religiously Christian . And she fakes being a Christian to get the job . Besides that offensive part of the plot she sees a crucifix of Christ several times and tosses it aside with her disdain or looks it with disdain . It is a very offensive movie . I would tell you the end but this is a review . Besides given the subject matter and this being a Hollywood produced film I am sure you can guess the ending .	-1
As a big Hartley fan , I tried hard to like this , but after about an hour , I just could n't continue . Unlike some of his other films , which are slightly excruciating in their pace but wo n't let you turn away , at some point , I just stopped caring about this one , and decided to give it fast forward help . There were no great insights though , or descriptive genius . It was just too long , and not as creative .	-1
Checked this out after reading a review & I tried but could n't watch it . It 's like watching bad theatre in a town where they have n't seen the good stuff.Apparently I forgot this poor experience & rented it ... Again ! Know the feeling ? I found myself watching the main actor . I was thinking , I hate this actor . Where have I seen him before ? Worse , in spite of oditties ( it was n't so odd or bizarre to me , just bad ) there seem never to be any insides to any of the characters.Checked IMDB & finally realised that I had made this mistake once before.Awful , boring , & irritating do not an art film make . It 's cheesy with some better than average cinematic values attached.However , as I always say in these weird grey areas , beauty is in the eye of the beholder . Something clicks for you here , God Bless .	-1
The musical performances given by `` The Dream Cast '' in this DVD ( 1998 ) of the concert version of the musical , Les Mis & eacute ; rables , are excellent . From full psyche to vigorous diaphragm , from single drum beat to entire chorus , and all the soloists in between , the theme of power as well as the sub-themes composed into this drama are very well done . This accounts for the audience response and overall effect . There are some weak spots in the lyrics however . Now , just to mention some ways in which Victor Hugo 's important work is distorted ? His descriptions of post-Napoleonic France are Rembrandt-like in their line and contrast ( light and dark ) , meaning and depth . The only aspects of the scenery that even approach this are the trench coat worn by Jean Valjean ( Colm Wilkinson ) and the graphic of the ragged child used with the title . Also the plight of Cosette ( Ruthie Henshall ) at the inn , as originally drawn , would n't be any opportunity for comic relief.Further , it seems the emphasis got shifted so that this version of `` Les Mis '' substantiates the opposite of values so intensely put forward in the novel.The principle of man as microcosm is lost and becomes the ideology of the community over the individual .	-1
This was a truly strange movie , from multiple perspectives . Firstly that Francis Ford Coppola would choose something like a pseudo romantic comedy to add to his resume . Secondly that Nicholas Cage would star as the male lead , when he was known before as being the dingbat bumbling fool and after as the brooding dark eccentric . And third , the whole premise of the movie was just plain odd.Kathleen Turner plays Peggy Sue , a divorced , middle aged and unhappy woman who goes to her high school reunion despite all her misgivings . At the reunion she faints , then wakes up back in time . She is once again in high school . She is given a chance to do it all over again.The foundation of this movie was not odd , as it 's been the theme of many sci fi and fantasy films past and present . There are a few funny moments with the typical fish out of water / anachronism humor ( I also remembered going to my high school reunion and remarking that a lot of things they taught were so useless - You did n't take Honors English last year so you have to stay in the Special Ed English class ! - You ca n't have study hall ! Gym class is priority ! - Take the science elective or you wo n't get into college ! , etc. ) . She starts off the movie saying that had she known then what she knows now , she would have done things much differently . We all think that at one point or another . And she does do some things differently , like going for the mysterious poet she always admired from afar . But , she does n't do things differently in the end . She is approached by the school nerd who would grow up to be a wealthy and successful man , and when he proposes that she change her destiny and marry him , she refuses . Peggy Sue said she wanted to go back to the present because she missed her kids . Missed her kids ? ! If she stayed in this time or went with someone else her kids would n't exist ! She ends up with her husband , perhaps because of this reason , and essentially continues back down the same path.That was a disappointment , a major disappointment . She goes back in time and does n't affect the future in a positive way , except to afirm to herself that she is content being miserable in the present . And how about that weird scene with her grandparents and trying to send her back in time at the Shriners ' convention ? Too stupid for words . The best part of this movie was Nicholas Cage , in that it would spring board him into other roles and a successful movie career . Otherwise do n't waste your time .	-1
This film had one good intention : a decent cast . It lacked direction , however , and seemed to be adrift in a sea of identity confusion . Is it a thriller ? Not quite . Is it a `` buddy '' film . Well , not really . It it a romance ? Uh-uh . It is a mish-mash of all of the above . There were some excellent action sequences ( many incredibly unbelievable ) , especially in the last 20 minutes . Some of the comic interplay between Wesley and Woody was amusing , but far from their chemistry in `` Jump '' . J-Lo 's character served no purpose except to show a little skin . She slowed the pace down for the first hour of the movie , it seemed like watching it in slow motion . It could have been an excellent action-packed buddy film of the Lethal Weapon genre if only the writers offered us a decent script . Instead , we got disconnected plotting and a whole lot of far-fetched antics . And Robert Blake should have `` Virginia Baked '' tattooed on his forehead . And what was up with Cooper 's character ? It seemed like the writers of the script came up with an idea for a serial killer/robber plot , but then could n't figure out what to do with him and wrote him out of the film halfway through without any resolution for his motive or background . Instead , the writers might have just recently spent an evening watching `` The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 '' and switched tracks , so to speak , and said `` hey , this might be a good idea for that new Harrelson/J-Lo/Snipes film we have to provide a script for tomorrow . '' The writing and direction seems to be spontaneous , and NOT in a good way .	-1
Just got to sit down to watch this ... and it starts in the middle ... not buying old dvd 's again ... this was a rip-off !	-1
This film was on & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; TV tonight , so I decided to watch it . I believe that I saw it once before , right after it first released back in 1998 ; you 'd think that I would have learned my lesson the first time.What . . . a. . . crock . And that crock ai n't full of butter . This has to be one of the most contrived scenarios ever in film . What ? You 've got a cop named Frank -- Andy Garcia -- who has a son Matt -- Joseph Cross -- where that son needs a bone marrow transplant , and the only person in the whole wide world is a psychopathic killer -- Michael Keaton -- who 's a match . Sure . So we know that both the psycho and the son will have surgery , and you know things will go terribly wrong , and you know that Mr. Keaton 's gon na go all Silence-of-the-Lambs ( SOTL ) all over everybody . & # 34 ; Clarice , and what did you think about while watching this film ? How b-a-a-a-a-d it was ? Perhaps you should have slaughtered it yourself and saved everyone the misery. & # 34 ; Har har.Talking about SOTL . . . . Obviously , the writer and director & # 34 ; borrowed & # 34 ; from that far superior film here , what with some of the stupid stuff with the Keaton character being a Hannibal Lecter-like dude . But really , if you 're going to & # 34 ; borrow & # 34 ; something , why do n't you take the best parts while borrowing , not the worst parts ? I was laughing out loud in a couple of scenes where I was supposed to be hiding under a blanket , I think.Well , I think that 1998 was about the same time where Mr. Keaton -- who was in some really funny movies way back when , remember ? Like & # 34 ; Night Shift & # 34 ; and the whole & # 34 ; let 's feed mayonnaise to the tuna fish ! & # 34 ; line ? -- and his career decided to take a swan dive . And this film does a horrible belly flop of its own , right into the tank.If a doctor came to me and said , & # 34 ; You need a bone marrow transplant to save your life , but to get that transplant , you 'll have to watch 'Desperate Measures ' first. & # 34 ; I think I 'd respond , & # 34 ; Get me my lawyer . I need to write my last will and testament . And quick. & # 34 ;	-1
Complete and utter crock of trash . The beginning of the film started off failrly well and I was starting to enjoy it . As if looking down a large and scary slop it all went down hill from that point on . I 'm struggling to find out how someone could rate this movie anything above 2/5 . I will admit that Michael Keaton played his character well , however , the plot of the movie was thin at best . All I can say is that buyer beware . If you like Micheal Keaton - then get it . If , for that matter , you like Andy Garcia as the 'cop who has to save is son ' then get it . Otherwise , steer clear of this movie as I personally did n't find it enjoyable .	-1
Despite the sticker hailing `` all new digital restoration '' this edition is no different from previous offerings- all the edge enhancement is stilll there . Stick with the superbit version	-1
Since Pioneer 's laserdisc version clocked in at 181 minutes , and this DVD is around 166 , you had to know that this release was going to be inferior . And , no surprise , it is . The Entrance , Intermission , and Exit music have all been cut out . The last verse to & quot ; The Lees Of Old Virginia & quot ; is gone . Plus , one of my favorite scenes has been taken out ... When John Adams is waking up at the foot of Thomas Jefferson 's stairs , and Philadelphia is starting it 's day.What a tremendous disappointment this DVD is , after having seen the Pioneer 's laserdisc release . Shame on Sony , and Peter Hunt for not giving us the entire print of this fabulous movie !	-1
I remember 1776 as a kid and I was excited as all get out when I finally gotmy 1776 Restored Director 's Cut ( 1972 ) movie.My Microsoft Media Player would n't play it and Quicktime/Real Player wantmoney to play it . Even my Nero Player would n't play this CD . So I'mstuck with a bad CD that does n't work . It will be awhile before I buy from Amazon unless they contact me and tell me what I need to doto get this movie CD to work . The intro plays but it is stuck on themain menu and wo n't go any further . I have tried everything.What a complete disappointment.1776 ( Restored Director 's Cut )	-1
They tried , honestly tried to give this film the release it deserves . The problem is they managed to mess up the aspect ratio on the initial release . That 's probably why this edition of the DVD has since been discontinued in favor of the extra special 2-disc edition . Amazon # B0007MAO0MOn a normal television the image appears squashed . On a widescreen TV it appears in 4:3 mode and still appears squashed . You have to manually expand it with the aspect setting on either your TV or DVD player . Either way it 's unwatchable . Get the 2 disc version instead .	-1
This movie was just okay . I thought it was a different movie , It was a good whoops though . I would n't recommend this movie	-1
The making of this movie was quite an undertaking . Unfortunately , it never quite makes the grade . The characters are not developed . Instead , they are caricatures of those whom they purport to be.One expedition leader , the late Scott Fischer , comes across as a mellow , disorganized , bumbling dude . One of his expedition guides , the late Anatoli Boukreev , is depicted as a self centered , Neanderthal like he-man , who clearly differs with his boss on what his role as a guide is to be.Another expedition leader , the late Rob Hall , fares somewhat better , in that he is portrayed as an organized , stand up expedition leader , who puts the welfare of his clients above his own . His much publicized radio farewll to his pregnant wife is included as part of the drama.Socialite Sandy Hill Pittman seems to represent conspicuous consumption and is depicted as a self-absorbed , rich bitch with little regard for the Sherpas whom she treats as little more than human yaks . Texan Beck Weathers fares little better , as he is characterized as a buffoon . I am sure that , were he to see this movie , he would wish that they 'd have left him on Everest.The actor who plays Jon Krakauer 's character has the thankless role of Greek chorus . He is there to basically tie up loose ends in the movie . He portrays Krakauer as a dour , humorless human being who , were it not for the fact that he is a talented writer , would have been pushed off the Lhotse face of Everest by some enterprising soul . Last , but certainly not least , are the Sherpas , who are shown as wise , brave , put upon souls . Now here , the movie is hitting its mark.The cinematography is laughable . Numerous shots of a mountain purporting to be Everest are easily spotted as shots of a mountain other than Everest . Since when is Everest without its signature tell tale plume , waving banner like in the sky ? Let me cut to the chase . Read the well written book upon which the movie is based , & quot ; Into Thin Air & quot ; by Jon Krakauer . Do not bother with this movie , unless , like me , you are an Everest junkie and a glutton for punishment . It is the only reason that I rated the movie with two stars instead of just one . Even so , it is still pretty much of a stinker .	-1
Into Thin Air : Death On Everest~1997I 'm afraid to say that this is a very poor movie based on a true story . If you want something along the similiar lines of this read Jon Krakauer 's book or watch Vertical Limit anyway I will tell you the plot : In May 1996 , writer Jon Krakauer joined a party of experienced and amatuer climbers-lead by Everest veterans Scott Fisher and New Zealander Rob Hall-who attempted to reach the world 's highest and most infamous mountain . Krakauer was one of the lucky ones , he made it back alive- 12 people did n't .	-1
If you want to enjoy this movie , you have to totally erase from your mind any thought that the story is based on Victor Hugo 's book.The book 's mighty themes of mercy , forgiveness and spiritual redemption are trampled to death with this depiction of a Valjean whose rage is always under the surface and barely contained . It 's not inconceivable that a man who has been brutally imprisoned for 19 years would emerge a hardened and angry man . But it 's not the portrayal you get in the book , and it erodes the sympathy you have for him in the movie . Strike a priest ? Hit Cossette ? ! ? Not a chance . ( And equally unbelievable that Cossette , minutes later , would stroke his cheek in love . ) It renders silly the scene in which Valjean refuses to kill Inspector Javert . The man in this movie would leap at the chance ! At least you get a good laugh as the scriptwriters try to craft a love story between Valjean and Fantine . She even rallies from her death bed to enjoy an intimate lunch with her benefactor -- rosy cheeks and all ! Ha ! And do n't even get me started on the ending , as Valjean strolls away from Javert 's suicide , light-hearted and smiling . One of the emotional cores of the story , co-opted by a Disney mindset.It 's incredible to think that a West End ( and Broadway ) musical got the story so much better . So , if you rented this movie and are determined to watch it , just forget anything you ever knew about the story and you 'll get through it .	-1
I very much wanted to see this movie when it first came out and so I did , but was very disapointed.After watching the Dream Cast musical on several occasions . You would think they could make something wonderful out of this book but it looked like to me they did n't even try .	-1
This movie is the epitome of excess : budget , explosions , melodrama , & quot ; cuteness & quot ; , in-jokes . LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is . It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands . The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as , & quot ; That skit was pretty cool , huh ? & quot ; . The action sequences , intended to be absurd , only elicit yawning . The child , who was intended to be cute , is annoying.The only saving grace , if you can call it that , LAH has is Arnold Schwarzeneggar 's performance . His ( non ) acting is just as good in this movie as it is in THE TERMINATOR or TRUE LIES . If the only good thing about your movie is Schwarzeneggar 's acting , then your movie is in serious trouble.I like a good spoof movie as much as anyone , as long as it is funny like BLAZING SADDLES or THE NAKED GUN movies . But I think this movie was best described on an episode of THE SIMPSONS . On that episode there was a fancy party in which all the beautiful people of Springfield attended . There was a character at the party inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggar named Rainier Wolfcastle . Police Chief Wiggum walked up the Wolfcastle and said , & quot ; Magic ticket , my a** ! & quot ; . My sentiments exactly .	-1
Truculent , unispired directed movie . The original idea was good , but was wasted while developing it . THi child is annoying , not a good actor at all .	-1
One has to wonder about the reasoning behind removing so much of this wonderful special 's original material from this DVD release . I have my original copy that I taped off of television way back in the mid 80 's , and I 'd rather watch THAT , fuzzy degrading , annoying Osh Kosh commercials , and all ... at least it 's INTACT . Not only have several songs been removed , but the final pay-off to a VERY long running gag ( the icy patch ) ended up on the cutting room floor , as well , being that it was at the very end of Piggy 's song ( & quot ; Home for the Holidays & quot ; , cut out ) . The editing is SO bad , you can actually TELL where things were removed . Such a shame . Here 's hoping the matter can be settled , and a fully-restored version offered ... though I would n't hold my breath . After all , there are MANY more Muppet television specials that have disappeared into the mists of time , as well .	-1
This is specifically about the Blu-Ray Unrated Edition of this movie . There are no extras on this Blu-Ray . None . Not even a commentary track . The DVD theatrical release does n't have much either , but at least it has a commentary . I bought this without reading the back of it closely enough , figuring it would have everything the old DVD I have did , but I was wrong ! So now I have to hang onto the DVD for the commentary , and for the pieces of the story that were REMOVED from this unrated edition ! A note to movie studios : Stop putting out Blu-Rays with no extras ! You have 25-50GB to work with . There is no excuse !	-1
A tale of hubris , betrayal , illicit sex , and murder , `` Wild Things '' stacks one surprise and cheap thrill on top of another until the whole thing comes tumbling down like a topheavy house . Lacking the fundamental assets of originality or an intelligent , coherent script , the film instead tries to dazzle the viewer with an endless string of nearly-impossible plot twists that finally unravels completely . Never meant to be taken completely seriously , `` Wild Things '' often crosses over into outright camp . The characters are unbelievable and unsympathetic , and the plot is beyond incredulity . Do n't blame the cast though ; Matt Dillon , Neve Campbell , Denise Richards , Kevin Bacon , and Bill Murray do what they can with the illiterate script and almost save the day with their collectively strong performance . But movies are a collaborative effort , and good acting alone ca n't make up for negligible direction and writing . The only other noteworthy facet of this movie is the slinky and haunting soundtrack . Sadly , that 's just not enough . Though not without its moments , `` Wild Things '' is too disjointed to recommend .	-1
I guess whenever there 's a movie on the war in Bosnia , there will be accusations of propaganda , skewing facts , rewriting history , biases , and so forth . As an aside , I do have to say that Savior comes out on the Serbian side , with Muslims being the definite bad guys here . ( If you 're looking for a relatively middle of the road view , see No Man 's Land . ) But that is none of my concern here.I understand the movie was made on a budget ( as seems clear from the director 's commentary ) , but that is no excuse for its many shortcomings.First , the good stuff.It looks great . Great location , nice colours , and it sounds good to boot . Good production.The action/fight scenes are very well done , not overdone in the ever so popular action movie style , but they do n't look cheap and cheesy , just natural and realistic . Violence is well measured , purposeful ( within the movie and plot ) and has realistic results and consequences.Camera work is good too , the close ups from Quaid 's PoV work especially well . It 's almost like being there : ) Finally , before I forget , the meat of the plot and Quaid 's character are quite good.But could have been worked better.The opening scenes ( developed as almost a separate sub-movie ) introduce us to Quaid 's character . Then he 's off to Foreign Legion boot camp , and does a couple of missions , which presumably make him a hardened veteran . Really , they 're just confusing . Too short to matter and to absorb . Suddenly we 're in Bosnia looking through a sniper 's scope . Aside from the opening scenes , we 're left to assume Quaid 's a tortured , restless , numb soul . He must be , because the director says so . Listening to the director 's commentary track , you have to laugh out loud at times , because what he 's describing and what you 're seeing are almost total opposites . And I do n't think it 's a language barrier.The director also keeps blaming the 'financiers ' for many things . They wanted this , and that , did n't like this , etc , etc . Please ... The dialogue is very stiff , very forced and unnatural . Good thing the kid gets off-screen early ; he 's your typical Hollywood portrayal of a child , asking all these insightful adult questions , like 'is god in bad people too ? ' Adults do n't fare much better , delivering disjoint , wooden lines every couple of minutes . And what 's with those voices ? Sure is a lot of grunting going around . Goran is just about the only guy with any soul showing in the movie.That 's my biggest beef here . It 's almost painful to sit through the thing sometimes , you just got ta cringe and bear it for a few more minutes.Which brings me to the last point . I do n't see this as a difficult movie , or tough , or rough , or challanging , or any of that . Some reviewer said that the slight glimmer of hope with the baby was the only thing that made it worthwhile . Personally , I thought the movie took the easy way out several times , the major one being the baby plot . Just a little too wishy-washy Hollywoody happy ending style . There are a couple of scenes that will make your average American movie goer wince and oooh , and aww ( out of social responsibility mostly ) , but nothing a seasoned war movie veteran has n't seen before in more brutal detail.Really , if the director intended for us to see Quaid 's stuggle with himself , his humanity , his search for hope , it should have been more subtle , using plot points like the baby as mere devices , means to an end , not bludgeon viewers over the head to make sure they do n't miss the obvious . And the director clearly indicates , time and time again , that this is a character study . Well , if it is , how come there 's so little character ? 2/5 . It 's not a bad movie , it just has a few bad points that really spoil a good idea , and a great opportunity for a classic and powerful film .	-1
I really do n't know what these guys were thinking . Maybe their thought process went a little like this : Exec # 1 : I have a great ( read : stupid ) idea ! Exec # 2 : What is it ? Exec # 1 : Remember those old Godzillla movies ? Exec # 2 : The ones that were really cool and did n't feature Matthew Broderick ? Exec # 1 : Yeah ! Let 's make a movie that 's the complete opposite of that ! So that 's how we got H-bomb-proof lizards turning into asexual she-beasts rampaging about in Manhattan . There are documentaries about cardboard factories more interesting than this . And if that does n't put the terror of this movie 's idiocy in perspective , think about this : I 've seen Ernest Goes To Camp SIX TIMES , and I still refuse to watch this trash again .	-1
This is the only film I have ever felt totally ashamed to have contributed to their theater take . Honestly , folks , this is one stinker of a movie whose excellent DVD features can not ever fully atone for.We all grew up watching the badly-dubbed Godzilla films from Japan , and many of us actually liked the campy , poorly translated flicks with a guy in a rubber suit stomping on model tanks and buildings ( and then later protecting the Earth from all manner of evil mega-monsters ) . Unfortunately , this film is everything that the Japanese films are not.Produced in the middle of a series of intentionally-made `` blockbuster '' movies ( following such fine fare as Independence Day and anticpating the awful Armageddon and Wild Wild West ) , this movie intentionally tries to go in too many directions to succeed -- is it a campy monster movie of the 60 's presenting ecological warnings , or perhaps an action/science thriller a la Jurassic Park , or even a special effects extravaganza ? Godzilla never seems to make up its mind.The action sequences fail to thrill as they come across as contrived and artificial , many looking to be made for prompt conversion to video games . The acting , too , leaves much to be desired ; Godzilla will stand always as a blemish on Matthew Broderick 's career . The movie goes on about an hour longer than it should , forcing audiences to endure the death of Godzilla only to face her ( ! ) babies , CG near-clones of velociraptors from Jurassic Park that chase our heroes around Madison Square Garden.Godzilla has the distinction of being one of less than a handful of films I 've shouted at in the theater -- here , when said title monster chases a helicopter through downtown NYC , I literally shouted , `` GO UP ! '' ... but apparently helicopters can only fly horizontally and get run down by a hungry monster.I would like to recommend this film for a `` bad movie night '' or for inclusion on any future episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but then I 'd be indirectly contributing to the film 's financial gains . Watch this for a laugh or a groan if someone else has it on hand , but do n't waste your own money .	-1
A series of nuclear weapons are tested in the South Pacific during the 1950 's , and the film Godzilla moves swiftly and uninterestingly into the present as a shocked Japanese man ( the only sign of Japanese involvement in this Americanized adaptation ) in a hospital deliriously repeats & quot ; Gojira , Gojira , Gojira & quot ; .As was the premise for the original film , nuke testing has spawned a huge Gojira ( Japanese for Sea Dragon ) . The name is later adapted in the film as it was in the filmgoing market , to Godzilla , a mere mispronunciation.Doctor Nick Tatopolous ( Matthew Broderick ) has been employed by the US military in order to help catch the ship-sinking , fire-breathing creature with the piercing roar and not so good looks . The lack of continuity is never more obvious than when Dr. Tatopolous explains the creature with great aptitude , even before it stomps into his life . From here , the film takes a by-the-numbers approach in that the last three-quarters of it yields nothing but explosions , fire and lots of stupid one-liners.And who could resist babies ! Discovered inside a now demolished Madison Square Garden , the nest with Godzilla 's 200 eggs is a mere walk down memory lane to James Cameron 's Aliens . Could there possibly be anything original to look forward to after that ? Do n't hold your fiery breath . Slews of rip-offs ranging from Jurassic Park to King Kong fill the rest of this hype-vehicle of no-brain folly . Godzilla is at best , remotely entertaining during the its 15 minutes . After which this mammoth publicity stunt loses steam at record rates . You would think that after creating such turkeys as ID4 and Stargate , the team of director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin ( the awesome twosome ? ) would have had enough sense to try to put out something commendable this time around . But like in many things , there is simply no cure . Not since Starship Troopers have I seen such bad visual effects , gratuitous violence and paper-thin story lines . The characters in this film are so cardboard , they belong in a police shooting range . Take a classic film and put it in the hands of profiteers rather than filmmakers , and I give you the official mascot for the worst movie since Waterworld .	-1
This is the worst . When I went to see this I was eagerly anticipating what Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich could do with the King of the Monsters , and afterwards I was so dissapointed I was in shock . The plot and acting were so checkered and badly formed that they could n't come close to standing on their own , so only the lizard creature could hope to save the movie . Unfortunatley this creature is so weak that it ca n't even save itself from a few fighter jets . As the movie rolled to it 's unsatisfying , pointless conclusion with an obvious hint at a sequel , I found myself constanlty checking my watch thinking & quot ; when will this movie end ? & quot ; I just want to put this abomination behind me and wait for Godzilla 2000 .	-1
This film is probably the best example of where movies are heading nowadays : big special effects , little or no plot . The acting was terrible , as was the script . It was meant to be funny and clever , I suppose , and it achieves the funny part , though it falls short of clever.As for the special effects , yeah , they were good , but they completely butchered Godzilla . So the Godzilla in the original movie was a guy in a suit , but I can just imagine what the directors of that one could have done with some CGI ! In the new version , Godilla is just an overgrown T-Rex . How does an iguana go from being a lizard to a bipedal , bird hipped dinosaur anyway , even through extreme mutation ? It 's just cheesy . Also , the baby zilla remind me WAY too much of velociraptors.Even if this film was meant to be a parody , as some have argued , it should n't have been . They should have let some TALENTED directors recreate this story for all it 's glory .	-1
A misguided Hollywood desecration of everyone 's favorite city stomper . Bearing no relation to the 1954 original , `` Godzilla '' ( 1998 ) gives escapism a bad name . Poor Matthew Broderick earns his top billing in an overlong snoozefest . What happened to the $ 130 million budget ? It 's certainly not on the screen .	-1
& quot ; Godzilla & quot ; is just like the creature after which it 's named : big , loud , and without direction . The plot only serves as an excuse for the movie , and the special effects are PlayStation silly . Matthew Broderick looks blank and does little to spice things up , and the dialogue is choppy . Oh , the soundtrack has a single from P. Diddy , who annoys me to no end . I ca n't say & quot ; Godzilla & quot ; is a complete disaster , but for an effects-heavy summer popcorn flick , you can do way better than this .	-1
No , this overblown epic from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin ( the masterminds who made `` Universal Soldier '' ) have come up with the most disappointing monster movie of all time . Go-chila was never seen and when he finally appeared on screen , everybody watching this trash had fallen asleep . Matthew Broderick plays a scientist who discovers the new breed which is a cross between an alligator , a lizard and Andre the Giant . An ugly piece of cinema . Helicopters and jets ca n't stop the thing because they just blow up monumental buildings in New York instead . No aim ! The creature chases the scientist and his friends and it 's not funny . Little Godzilla babies run around making a mess of consession stands in Madison Square Garden . Bad mother for not teaching your children manners . Bad director for making a slow boring movie that is just another `` The Lost World : Jurassic Park '' done worse . Japanese people should be ashamed of this movie that does n't contain people running around waving their arms like maniacs screaming , `` Godzilla ! '' But , I was doing that running out of the theaters with popcorn spewing out of my mouth .	-1
You know , I have been watching godzilla films since the 60 's , although the film is good..they forgot the name of the show , godzilla ... not people run though new york..we olny see godzilla breifly.and only half of him..well I guess thats show bissnesses	-1
Looking over Maria Pitillo 's career , she has done rather well as an actress . But as soon as GODZILLA , the bomb of 1998 , arrived , her career took a nosedive . Perhaps it was because she won a Razzie Award for worst supporting actress . Or maybe it was because her critics were unkind . It is true that Ms. Pitillo 's sub-par performance was just one distraction in this monumental piece of celluloid crap . But I am not going out of my way to compliment Matthew Broderick 's acting . Nor was Jean Reno helpful . And thank goodness for The Simpsons or else Hank Azaria might be out of work . None of these performers impressed me . And yet only Ms. Pitillo has been directly affected by Roland Emmerich 's GODZILLA , easily the worst movie of 1998 . Ms. Pitillo should not be blamed for her performance in a movie filled with poor acting . The writing was bad . The direction was bad . Even Godzilla ( herself ? ? ? ) seemed embarrassed by this fiasco . How can you blame one actor when you should be pointing the finger at the whole production ? As for Maria Pitillo , I expect she will one day bounce back from this unruly treatment some day soon , and win an award for her many acting skills , and it wo n't be another Razzie .	-1
when i went to see this hyped film in 1998 i was sooo disappointed . i mean i do admire Roland Emmerich and Dean Devilin for StarGate and ID4 , but some people says this makes Ishtar and Howard the Duck look like Winners and i myself did loved & quot ; Howard The Duck & quot ; but this Movie & quot ; Godzilla & quot ; i really did n't like . save your Money on the ID4 DVD instead .	-1
There 's some nuclear tests by the French taking place in the Pacific Ocean , while some iguanas are watching nearby . Flash forward to the present day , a Japanese ship is attacked by something , with one guy surviving and when asked by people what happened he simply said `` Gojira '' , which translated to Godzilla . An NRC scientist named Nick ( Matthew Broderick , `` Glory '' ) studies this and arrives at the conclusion that a giant , radioactive grown lizard is the cause ( which is a reasonable conclusion to make , in fact the first one I 'd make ) and that this lizard could come and attack the U.S.Godzilla does arrive in New York , causing a massive wave of destruction yet somehow a cameraman named Victor ( Hank Azaria , `` The Simpsons '' ) is spared despite being right in the path of his foot . From here on its about the military trying to stop Godzilla who continues to cause damage wherever he goes.I certainly would n't expect a movie with Godzilla to be a well written or decently acted flick , but the dialogue , story and acting is just bad and I mean bad . The action sequences even the initial attack on Manhattan are fairly mundane and not very exciting , the explanation for Godzilla 's visit is just laughable and the end sadly left open the chance for a sequel.It was sad to see actors like Jean Reno ( `` The Professional '' ) used in this tripe , he is funny but it seems forced to as he 's much better than this . The director Roland Emmerich ( `` Independence Day '' , `` The Patriot '' ) really just seems to phone it in on a lot of this and the effort put into the destruction in the action scenes while good initially just seems hollow after a bit . * out of 4 stars .	-1
Not godzilla at all.Godzilla was very big and did n't hide in sewers.He knocked buildings down , didnt run around them.He was smart , not just a big iguana.This was more like an escapee from jurassic park.I liked Jean Reno , hated Mathew broderick .I really disliked this film first time i saw it but later revisited it ( this yr ) and didnt find it quite so objectionable but still should n't have been called godzilla .	-1
I can remember as a kid , always loving Godzilla.I loved watching the old 1950 & 1960 's Japanese films.This one however , is a far cry from any of the classics , and sets itself up in history as one of the `` Big Block Buster Boobs '' of the summer.Kids will love the movie for the moster , because it does look impressive on screen , and the special effrects are fantastic.The story is ok , but infentile at best.It was very predictacble , but I think the story itself was engineered that way.All in all , I would'nt pay a red cent to own it , it really is'nt worth it .	-1
In 1998 , long time Godzilla fans feared the worst when Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich unleashed their monster `` epic '' , but one thing was missing ... .GODZILLA ! Where is Godzilla in this movie ? I sure do n't see him , do you ? I thought this was going to be a Godzilla film , not another Jurassic Park sequel . Oh , do n't get me wrong ... Tristar and Devlin/Emmerich are n't the only ones to blame for this truly AWFUL film , but the owners of Godzilla in Japan , Toho ! They were the ones who approved the terrible new design of Godzilla , and ultimately had to make up for it by bringing back the TRUE and REAL Godzilla in Japan only a year later . As for this film ( if you can even call it that ) , avoid it and just be glad that it FAILED and Devlin/Emmerich will never again lay a finger on the true king of the monsters - GODZILLA ! ( a few short years later , the Devlin/Emmerich team broke up , and the planned sequel never happened . Let 's all rejoice ! I hope Devlin and Emmerich are proud of themselves ... )	-1
This is one of the worst movies I 've seen ever . This is a story about a man , nammed Billy Hayes ( Brad Davis ) who tries to smuggle hessise ( turkish drug ) across the boader to America . But there is one small problem he gets caught . He is sentecenced to serve four years in a turkish prison . Billy leaves a worried girlfriend , father , mother , brother , and sister behind . In the prison he meets durgies and a whole new kind of people he never thought would exsist . The guards beat and tourcher not only him but everybody in that prison and other prisons in that part of the world were just the same . In Turkey who do n't have the right to free speech like in America so when he went to court he had a hard time trying to defend himself . Billy is then sentenced to 30 years in the prison which I might add does not really qualify as a prison at all in my opinon . Billy and Rand quaid and one other person try to escape for every day for a whole week but then they are caught by a inmatte who gives randy qaid away . Randy is beaten so bad that he is in a hospital for months with a hernia . Billy gets so mad he kills ruski the immate who gives them away and basically goes insane witth rage and then immeditly after he is sent to a turkish mental institution with pyscos . His girlfriend talks to him and he has a new light os getting out . He bribes then kills a guard puts on his uniform and leaves . Three months later he crosses the boarder into Greece and gets on a plane and goes back to America to reunite with his family.This is emmotional true story . I dont like this movie for many reasons one is almost have the movie is spoken in the turkish natoinal language . This has too many graphic seens that I do n't care for and many people wo n't like . I was frequntly looking at how much time was left in the movie and you should never be doing that when your wacthing a movie . I do n't like this for another reason becausethe story is horribal even though it is true . I just do n't like to see Americans being beaten in a turkish prison . Maybe you would like to rent this movie and see what I 'm talking about but this is definitly not a movie to buy .	-1
at no time does this movie ever reach the point of being beliveable and even for an action movie at some point it has to do that ! the helicopter is very cool , but do they really think that if it was going to be used to keep everyday people in line they would test it out in the open like this much less let a pilot that is known as aloose cannon be the one to test it ? the other problem is that they go out of their way to keep the movie lite and then add a very sick murder in for spice i guess . skip it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
It seems that the Region 1 DVD release of `` Blue Thunder '' which has been available for some time includes only a `` pan & scan '' movie presentation . For those waiting for a Region 1 `` widescreen '' movie presentation , a `` Widescreen Special Edition '' release has been announced for April 4 , 2006 .	-1
BLUE THUNDER ( 1983 ) Directed by John Badham . Written by Dan O'Bannon.Starring Roy Scheider , Warren Oates , Candy Clark , Daniel Stern , Anthony James , Joe Santos , James Murtaugh , Jack Murdock and Malcolm McDowelll.A helicopter pilot for the Los Angeles police tortured by his time among the drunken hopheaded racist nazi baby killing rapists in Vietnam is chosen to test a new futuristic super helicopter called Blue Thunder that is intended for use against any terrorists or civil uprisings.This somehow being a bad thing , those behind the helicopter -- -Vietnam Veterans , the police and representatives of the Reagan administration ( Christians and Jews being busy that week ) apparently feel the need to justify the weapon 's existence by sending agents into the Watts area to create disturbances -- - as we all know Watts is otherwise a bastion of peace and law abiding citizenry and all the crime there is committed by Whites in blackface -- -and murder anyone who opposes the new weapon -- though why just any clear headed patriotic American WOULD oppose the Blue Thunder is not clear..The pilot discovers this vast right wing conspiracy , steals the helicopter and attempts to get the truth out . The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy attempts to stop him destroying much of downtown Los Angeles in the process.While the technical aspects of the film -- -especially the flying scenes and the BlueThunder itself are generally cool and well done and the acting is about as good as it can be , the film is grounded by the basic foolishness of its premises which eventually leaves the film just sitting on the tarmac as the passengers wait impatiently to get off.The idea that it is a bad thing to have a super helicopter for use against terrorists and rioters was stupid then and , after the Rodney Riots , the Crown Heights pogrom and 9/11 , is exactly what one would think it is now . Obviously it would be VERY BAD that the Blue Thunder existed ... ... ... ..for terrorists , rioters ... ..and their allies and supporters . For everyone else , the Blue Thunder would be a great and wonderful thing.The film has the usual commie prop smears . The main villain Macolm MacDowall is the inexplicably English -- and so vaguely homosexual -- - Nordic looking Vietnam Vet who used to enjoy tossing noble Communist officers from his helicopter in Vietnam though he somehow manages not to take drugs , drink nor does he rape anyone but that is about it . Schreider is given Candy Clark to show that he is a good virile heterosexual like all good liberals are . Certainly Clarke -- the only female in the cast save briefly a Black Woman who is nearly raped by the agents of the Right Wing Wing Conspiracy -- serves no other purpose and , in fact , one is still unsure whether she is supposed to be Scheider 's wife or girlfriend . Scheider is also shown having a Hispanic friend . His token Black friend being out of town that week.The film makes a big whoha over how the Blue Thunder is somehow this great big threat to civil liberties and Democracy and yet takes great glee in violating those same civil liberties of McDowall and crew upon the apparent theory that Communist , liberals and minorities have Civil Right but people they do not like do not.The script -- -flawed in many ways from lack of plot resolutions to underdelveloped characters -- - makes the major and tension deflating mistake of having Scheider steal the Blue Thunder and having the villains try and stop him with inferior weaponry . The thing is practically a flying tank and yet the big dog fight at the end is between Scheider in his unstoppable flying fortress and McDowell in this little helicopter put put.What ANY OTHER normal filmaker would have done would to have dropped the whole silly ass vast ring wing conspiracy plot and have the helicopter stolen by either a Moslem Terrorist or a Communist agent who plan to do something bad with it and then send Scheider up in the little helicopter put put to try and stop it . That is called suspense . That is called putting the hero up against tremendous odds.But no . We had to have our Commie Prop . Reagan was in office and there were things more important than such luxuries like artistic integrity or even competent film making.This was Warren Oates last film . He died soon afterwards . Pity this was his last film.Blue Thunder is merely just a little gas.Take an alka seltzer.One wonders if the Blue Thunder is still futuristic or has the present caught up to the Sci Fic elements ? ? If so , one DOES hope though that the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy rebuilt the Blue Thunder and sent it to Iraq , Afghanistan and the Philipines to aid a good number of Moslem Barbarians to attain their Islamic paradise .	-1
This is one of the most average horror movies I 've ever seen . The 1990s was a miserable time for the horror genre . The fact that some consider Candyman to be an underrated classic highlights my point . I do like the idea of a researcher looking into an urban legend but the movie is just not well done . The characters are awful and the movie is simple not scary in any way .	-1
If the title of our review was n't a dead giveaway , this movie was incredibly boring . Candyman was released in 1992 and was dubbed by many as a top-notch horror flick . The 1990 's was the golden age of horror , at least in Sid 's slightly unorthadox view . This is a perfect example of what 's wrong with the film industry . This certified snoozer gets the nod as a worthwhile flick while true 90 's classics likeWicked GamesandDeath Ring ( aka The Greatest Movie of All-Time ) go overlooked . But we decided to go with this one based on the fact that it got so much hype when it came out.Basically , the Candyman can be summoned by reciting his name 5 times in the mirror . And once the juice is loose , he will only harm you if you do n't believe in his meat hooking powers . So it lends itself to logic that if you believe in the Candyman , you know what saying his name 5 times will bring ; Sid 's guess is that you just take a pass on chanting `` Candyman '' and keep living a normal life . But not our main character . Nope , she risks her life and those around her to write an awesome thesis on urban legends . Why could n't this girl just do some research to write her thesis ? That 's the one question that can unravel this ridiculous plot.Sid could not find one good thing about this movie . It was plodding , boring , shallow and pedantic . It definitely IS NOT a flick that we would have enjoyed in the good old days . It even gets this lowly distiction : when we turned this piece off from on demand we yelled `` He 's gone ! The evil 's gone from here ! ''	-1
Stay away from this one unless you like digital noise . I am also tired of Criterion skimping on bitrate all the time . Sure , if there are some extras that absolutely need to be there but going below an average bitrate of 25Mbps is surely not needed . What and the hell separates this from so many other transfers just in that range ? On the other hand the digital noise makes this a terrible release.Do n't waste your money unless you NEED to see this in hi-def and like to collect films . I ca n't support it because Criterion knows better . With the misframing of Blue , more than a couple very mediocre transfers , and a whole bunch of middling 20Mbps-24Mbps transfers you really should pick what you buy from them carefully these days.Most of what they do is fantastic stuff . Even some of the lower bitrate releases look great . But when the master used is in bad shape or not for hi-def you ca n't ask for 20 dollars for it much less 40 .	-1
and not really Anthony 's , either . I borrowed the VHS from a friend anticipating a lovely , two-hour or so film with rich , well-developed characters , beautiful scenery , and a riveting storyline . I guess one out of three 's not bad.Howards End promises a lot but underdelivers . With Emma Thompson , Sir Anthony Hopkins , and Helena Bonham-Carter in the lead roles , one expects a more interesting film or at the very least , an exciting climax . One gets neither . This film plods along for over two hours , much like an overworked carthorse stumbling through the English countryside . By the end , all one wants is some oats and a night 's sleep in the barn . What disappointed me most was Bonham-Carter 's performance . She is much better at edgy hysteria than what she shows here.Even the climax was dull . ( In case you still want to see this film , I wo n't give it away . ) In this reviewer 's opinion , if you want a good Merchant Ivory flick , watch A Room with a View instead .	-1
Despite what Criterion may say , there is a fault with this disc . They have said you need to calibrate your set , or that you should n't watch the disc on vivid and sharp mode . But lowering these settings is not enough to get rid of all the digital noise on this disc , and it 's the only blu-ray I 've ever come across that looks this bad . I encourage you to rent the disc before you buy it , so you can see for yourself.I hate giving one star to a movie this good . But the Blu-ray is not even worthy of that one star .	-1
I am really glad that this is an anomaly , instead of the usual fare that we come to expect from JCVD . Some peeping Tom like behavior and a really uncomfortable scene in the river , plus a crappy ending . Then the rest was boring . I rented this , and will only be watching it once . I do n't expect non-stop action , but this could have been better .	-1
The Quick and the Dead , 1995 filmThis story is set in a tiny town in a desert . A bandit gang has taken over , and oppresses the people with high taxes and low wages . [ Any similarity to your city , state , or country is purely coincidental . ] This ruler is famous for his prowess with a quick draw of a pistol . [ The quick draw fantasy was concocted by Eastern writers of fiction , although there may have been a few examples in the real west . ] The ruler arranges gladiator contests using pistols to awe and amuse the townspeople ( no other sporting events ) . Each gladiator has a personal history that is given as part of the story . There are personal conflicts as well , however fantastic they seem . Do not expect to learn anything , its just entertainment.Of course there has to be some sort of moral , and ending where the good guys win over the villains . You 'll see examples taken from horror films where the monster pops up after being killed and assumed dead . This works better in films with an unearthly creature . The styles of dress say the late 19th century . The isolation of this town ( no railroads or stagecoaches ) suggests an Arizona desert . There is no mention of mining or other production to explain this isolated town . Does this story have any redeeming social value ? Not even as a costume drama . If you watch it closely you can estimate which scenes use doubles and the editing to hide this . There are better films that you can watch for entertainment and education .	-1
There are a lot of things wrong with this western . It has a great premise with lots of promise ; a great cast that could and should deliver strong performances and yet it comes across overly campy and boring and ultimately forgettable . I was initially excited to see this film since I adore everything Russell Crowe ( how many times have I uttered those words this past week ) but when I saw this film a few years back I cringed at the thought that he starred in this drivel . I shrugged it off as a minor misstep in an impressive career and moved on . A few weeks back though my wife happened to rent this thinking I 'd be excited to watch it . Having just watched the Crowe masterpiece ` 3:10 to Yuma ' and salivating over every frame I decided that maybe I 'd enjoy this movie now . Well , my opinion has n't changed. ` The Quick and the Dead ' drops us in the dusty town of Redemption ( such a clich & eacute ; western name ) and introduces us to its rowdy inhabitance . The town is ruled with an iron fist by tyrant John Herod who seems to thrive on the spilled blood of others . He has butted heads with reformed Cort , a man of God who has left his criminal ways of the past behind him . Herod refuses to let him forget the man he once was and tries to pressure him into signing up for his ` Quick Draw ' contest . Cort refuses and thus makes himself Herod 's prisoner . Then in walks Ellen , a young woman apparently scorned who has a vendetta against the evil Herod . She enters his contest in order to have her revenge by taking his life.Like I said , the premise has promise , but it all falls terribly flat . The biggest problem I have is the atrocity that is Sharon Stone . I 'll never understand this woman 's draw on the public . Her acting chops is the farthest thing from decent ; in fact she 's so horrid that the mere fact I ` LOVE ' her performance in ` Casino ' almost repulses me . She does n't understand Ellen in the slightest and plays her so sullen and so dull that I wish they had cast someone slightly talented for the role . The only good thing I can say about Stone is that she hand picked Crowe for his role here ; so at least she notices real talent despite her lack of it . DiCaprio is another drawback . I love what this kid became but this performance is too hammy for me to appreciate . Russell Crowe and Gene Hackman are the only redeeming factors to this film when it comes to acting . Crowe 's performance , while not his finest , is strong and polished and Hackman is always top-notch when playing the villain . Sadly , they alone ca n't save this mess.I like the point I heard one reviewer make in regards to this film ; that it 's a Sam Raimi film and so it must be a cartoon . He then proceeded to make that a good thing but I ca n't do that . It is a cartoon but I do n't think that was purposeful and that what makes it so horrific . When Stone tries to act hard , hurt or suffering she looks tired , bored and confused . Raimi tries to make something dramatic and meaningful and fails miserably . The ending was so corny and contrived that I could n't stop rolling my eyes , even after they started aching and begging for mercy . In the end I went with two stars over the more appropriate on for the fact that both Crowe and Hackman at least deserve a star a piece for trying desperately to salvage this burning heap of trash .	-1
I do not own this movie on bluray or DVD but I do have it on VHS . The only reason I have this movie at all is I got involved in a video club many years ago and it was free . This movie has only one plot , turn gunfighting into a sport . That 's it ! A couple of hours ( not sure how long the film is since I 've only wathed it once ) of two people standing in the street shooting at each other . The one that looses is dragged off and another one steps up . Terrible ! Those that know history know that gunfights in the old west was not as prevailent as in the movies for a couple of reasons . First , you could die , second , guns were not very acurate , third , ammo was expensive . I love westerns for the stories they tell about life back then but this dog has none of that . I 've tried to give this movie away several times and thought I was sucessful a couple of times but it always came back mysteriously . If you love westerns , stay way from this one ! ! ! The only reason I gave this movie one star is because I could n't give it the negative 5 stars it deserves ! !	-1
Anyone ANYONE who liked this movie has zero appreciation for a good western.this is one of the worst movies ever ! western or any genre ! ! ! !	-1
The Bottom Line : With its exploding grass shacks , evil ethnic enemy types , Central American locations and uninspired acting , Sniper often plays more like a boring parody of action movies than a legitimate entry in the genre ; unless you 're a die-hard fan of Tom Berenger or Billy Zane ( do those exist ? ) I would advise you to stay far away from this unappealing film.2/4	-1
I do n't know if this movie is dated or was never funny in the first place . I wish I saw it in 1981 so I could better assess this . Bill Murray basically plays Saturday Night Live 's Bill Murray , a one-dimensional wise-ass character who 's supposed to be cool but is more irritating than anything else . The ending is reminiscent of Animal House : tanks and mayhem substituting for humor .	-1
While the original DVD extended edition gave you the option of seeing the original classic movie the blu ray does not . The additional footage adds absolutily nothing to the movie and changes it from a wonderful comedy to a movie that becomes bogged down in scenes that should have remained on the cutting room floor . SONY/Columbia Pictures should be ashamed for not releasing the original classic movie first on blu ray or at least having the original as a part of the extended blu ray disk . While I give the original moive five out of five stars this extended edition in my opinion barely holds on to two out of five stars .	-1
This new edition of TO DIE FOR is n't what you think..Sony and Image are not telling the truth about the aspect ratio . It is NOT 1.85:1 . It is , in fact , the 1.33:1 version . They used the wrong side of the previous 2-sided disc . Do n't believe the info written about the aspect ratio of the current edition .	-1
I saw this movie when I was like 11 . It was cool then because it was mindless action but , it do n't have the same affect on me now . It 's super corny	-1
Aside from anything else that is good or bad , routine or entertaining about this film , I ca n't be the only one who was completely unable to get past the fact that , in the big murder scene , both the hero and the victim act more stupefyingly idiotic than any characters in the lowest-grade teen slasher ever made .	-1
This is one of several Brian De Palma films that pay tribute to the Master of Suspense , director Alfred Hitchcock . While De Palma has never come close to equaling his hero , he has done some great imitations of him in movies like `` Dressed to Kill '' and `` Blowout '' . `` Body Double '' , however , is a weak effort by any standard . It has been branded a blatant rip-off of `` Vertigo '' , but I do n't think it 's even that.In the convoluted plot , an actor needs a temporary place to stay , and an acquaintance puts him up in a spectacular Hollywood Hills home . The friend points out that , through a telescope in the house , one can spy on a woman in a house across the way . Said woman puts on quite a striptease show every evening . One night , the actor sees the woman being robbed by a very spooky character . Already obsessed with her , he begins to follow her around town to make sure she is okay . His spy games lead to danger , murder and some rather graphic encounters in the world of porn video making.This is one of those movies that hinge on a totally improbable plot device . Though he uses a whole bag of cinematic tricks which make some of the movie rather interesting to look at , De Palma never manages to fool the audience into going with the flow of the ludicrous story . The movie can be looked at as a spoof of suspense thriller ; however , it does n't succeed very well on that level either.De Palma had directed some fine movies in his time . `` Body Double '' is definitely a low point , in my opinion . Besides the films mentioned above , the good ones include three crime sagas - `` The Untouchables '' , `` Scarface '' , and `` Carlito 's Way '' , as well as the horror classic , `` Carrie '' .	-1
A limp production not large enough for Streisand 's ego . This vehicle is so self-absorbing , you 'd better have the barf bag ready as soon as you hit play on your VCR . The plot is so unrealistic , only the & quot ; sensitive & quot ; Barbra could have endeavored to make this film.Alright , already Barbra ! You 're the greatest and only good-natured person on the earth !	-1
I thought this movie would be awesome because I knew all those scary stories , and loved them . Unfortunately , Urban Legend 's writer does n't know the meaning of the word & quot ; originality. & quot ; This movie copied off of Scream . At the frat party , the character , Parker , gets a call from the killer on the phone . Of course , the killer is using a voice changer , just like in Scream . Did the writer actually think people would find that scary or original ? I think he was too wrapped up in being on the horror bandwagon that he failed to come up with something original .	-1
I really enjoy Sci-Fi films and the whole cyberpunk genre , but this movie just did n't do it for me . The trailers for this film looked compelling , so I rented it on VHS , but after about 20 minutes I was out like a light . I found this film so dry that it put me to sleep . Look for your Sci-Fi elsewhere kiddies , this one is more potent than Niquil .	-1
You really need to buy the Blu-Ray version of this film.What you get here with this old dvd is a cut-down-zomed-in version.Get the blu-Ray and you 'll get to see the actual whole Movie Film . : D	-1
Boy , after the great & quot ; question reality & quot ; movies like Dark City and The Matrix came out , the bar was raised a little higher for this genre . Unfortunately The Thirteenth Floor falls way short of ever reaching the bar , let alone going over it . The concept of virtual worlds , within virtual worlds did n't quite work in this version because you never find out why they exist . In The Matrix we at least find out that the virtual world therein was created to make humans sedate as they were used as organic power supplies by the AI . The Thirteenth Floor is a pretty hum-drum affair . Every time they used the word & quot ; user & quot ; I kept thinking of the classic Tron , a different , yet far better virtual world movie . The ending was pretty useless . It really answered no questions , and ( heaven forbid ! ) left the way open for a possible sequel . And another thing , the title had nothing to do with the movie other than the lab resided on the 13th floor , and every once in awhile you would see a finger push the elevator button to reach that floor . The scene where Douglas Hall drove to & quot ; the end of the world & quot ; was rather weak as well . As he stood there talking on his cellphone he stared at an untextured wireframe of his existence , hokey . I did n't hate this movie because the concept of virtual worlds is rather intriguing . . . they just managed to make it boring ! So that still only leaves two & quot ; cyberpunk & quot ; movies ever released that are really worth seeing : Strange Days and , of course , The Matrix .	-1
I finally watched this movie , hoping for a more CGI version of Fassbinder 's remarkably great movie & # 34 ; World on a Wire & # 34 ; ( 1973 ) , or even something that was respectful to the original story . It was neither ; I was astounded at how bad this movie was.Notes before reading : 1 ) I read the Galouye story , & # 34 ; Simulacron-3 , & # 34 ; BEFORE watching either Fassbinder 's adaptation or this one ; 2 ) I am a fan of Armin Mueller-Stahl ; 3 ) I enjoy sci-fi immensely . I really , really attempted to like this movie , mostly because of the numerical ratings it has received here and on imdb ( and I do n't read the written reviews beforehand ) .The beginning really made me believe I was going to be awed : the great 1930s landscape , a film noir look , interesting-looking set designs , and ( to top it all off ) the GREAT Armin Mueller-Stahl ! But what brought me awe quickly turned into balderdash . The story merely relied on 1/3rds of the original story , with the characters changing their original literary roles that gave the story so much depth . The questions of & # 34 ; what is real & # 34 ; in the original story was not the cynical plot of this adaptation . The special effects were the equivalent to those of a rock concert , with laser lights in fog , glowing eyes , and ( straight from television 's & # 34 ; Stargate SG-1 & # 34 ; - but even less graphic ) wormholes ! I do n't know what the budget was for this movie , but I guarantee that Fassbinder 's wonderful adaptation was even less than the budget for this movie.The story follows Douglas Hall and his attempt to find the killer of Fuller , his partner . Dennis Haysbert plays , with little depth , a detective ( who has an entirely different role in the story ) attempting to find the murderer . Vincent d'Onofrio looks and acts like a slightly-overweight John Malkovich , playing the most interesting character , the Simulacron-3 technician , but , with how interesting the other characters were , this really is n't saying much . Basically , you have a huge cast of TV actors and actresses , and there is a reason that they do TV ( even though some have & # 34 ; touched & # 34 ; cinema , off and on ) .I really do n't know how far to go in the scenario , but I felt like I was watching a really bad , B-grade , made-for-cable-TV sci-fi that was relying more upon capitalizing on the success of & # 34 ; The Matrix & # 34 ; and others of its ilk than being true to Galouye 's story . I tend to believe that the filmmakers were wanting to & # 34 ; jump on the bandwagon & # 34 ; at the time , regardless of the cost to the original story . Perhaps many of those reviews that give this movie such high marks were done by those anti- & # 34 ; The Matrix & # 34 ; fans . I really do n't know . Maybe times have changed , and many of the reviewers may want to go back and replay this movie with some more objectivity.Even more aggravating is that the movie must be so bad in the producers ' eyes that they ca n't even stand to release the DVD in WIDESCREEN ! ! ! That really tells you something ! I commented to my wife that more money was probably spent on the helicopter shots than the rest of the movie . I really wish Galouye 's original story would be given the credit and respect it is due , along with the ability to do so with the CGI effects that are now the mainstay of cinema.I give 2 stars for Mueller-Stahl ( always a great screen presence , even though his acting is wasted here ) and for the quite breathtaking ending effects of the future in the end - the end being the closest to that of the novel , but too late for the rest of the movie to be good .	-1
I 've seen The Wire series recently , if you wonder where I 'm coming from.Outside of being very one dimensional and boring , the film leaves too many questions without answering.For example , why could't Cage at least give his wife some HINTS about the kind of case he was involved in ? Or why when he found the diary in the toilet did n't he just hand it to the mother ? Or why , when Cage parked his car in a really rasty area with lots of grubby and suspicious characters nearby , why did n't he lock his car ? I 'm from that part of California , and I certainly would have.Or how did Machine know Cage was after him in the house ? Cage seemed quiet to me . And where was the mother during all the action ? And how did Machine hide in the house so he could restart the record ? The movie depends heavily on characters who are evil without real motive . There may be people like that , but they are quite rare . They are n't rare in cliche hack movies like this one , though .	-1
Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker is right on the verge of becoming the next big thing in Hollywood . He was the brain behind such great films as `` Se7en '' , `` Sleepy Hollow '' , and did some uncredited re-writes for `` The Game '' and `` Fight Club . '' All those films were excellent , and `` 8mm '' could have been too , had it not been handed to Joel Schumacher , the man who ruined the Batman series and who is the biggest hack in Hollywood . ( Except for `` Tigerland '' , which was a fluke . ) The story , born from Walker 's brilliant mind , sounds great . A Private Eye ( Nicolas Cage ) , is hired by a billionare 's Widow after she found a possible `` snuff '' film in her dead husband 's safe . So Nic Cage is sent to find out whether or not the film is real , plunging him into a sordid mystery filled with seedy characters and dark , abandoned buildings ( Not a cliche or anything ) .Could have been good . Should have been good . Would have been good , had A ) David Fincher directed like originally planned , B ) had Andy Kevin Walker had more creative input , and C ) had Joel Schumacher had not taken over directing duties ! The guy is horrible.After Walker and Schumacher fought over creative differences , Walker walked , and left Schumacher and Nic `` When 's the last time this guy made a good movie ? '' Cage to run the show themselves . Want some examples ? Okay . When the film was supposed to be suspenseful , I was shifting in my seat , yawning , checking my watch , etc . The big twisty ending ( which went on way too long ) was predictable , not to mention Schumacher and a new screenwriter he brought in tacked on a `` happy ending . '' The acting for the most part is stiff and wooden . Not to mention the only way that the characters know how to express their emotions is by shouting the `` F-word '' at the top of their lungs.To wrap things up , what could have been a hip and edgy thriller in the right hands , became a dull , predictable , and savagely unpleasant piece of poop in Schumacher 's hand . Even if they could n't get Fincher , the producers should have replaced him with someone with an eye for this kind of material . ( For example a Chris Nolan , or a Roman Polanski ) At least then they might have had a good movie . Maybe Walker will have better luck with his next screenplay ...	-1
I still remember waiting for this one to come to the theatre . First of all , the previews gave no suggestion as to what the viewer was in for . When I finally saw it , I was disappointed as the story topics and images were so disturbing and graphic , it was hardly entertaining and definitely unenjoyable . I am a Nicolas Cage fan but he couldnt save this one . The whole idea of his going undercover as a lover of deviant and illegal pornographic film to solve a case is a little much to believe . Especially when he has a wife and child at home . It reminded me of how Al Pacino 's character in & quot ; Cruising & quot ; , went undercover as a frequenter of low-life , s & amp ; m , gay bars to catch a murderer of homosexuals . Who would volunteer to do that ? Cage 's character becomes obsessed and mentally disturbed by everything he sees but ultimately solves the case . The tone is set with the scene where Cage first views the & quot ; snuff & quot ; film of the murder . The way he reacts to it is how you will probably react to most of the movie , Shocked and sickened . The story is unpleasant and by the time the climax arrives , you 'll probably be as numb as Cage 's character . It 's an experience all right , but not a good one .	-1
This film is about the fakest snuff ever seen . I have n't laughed this hard at mock depravity since I saw an Insane Clown Posse music video.If the acting was any worse , I 'd want them to kill me.However , what it lacks in conviction , emotion , articulation , and sincerity , it does manage to be stylish.But seriously- likening the whole SM scene to crazed murderers is really not fair . It 's just more garbage pumped out to sustain a stereotype.This is not disturbing . If you think it is , you have n't seen much . Go rent & quot ; Ilsa , she wolf of the SS , & quot ; and then tell me this is disturbing . Rebeca on Sunnybrook Farm scared me more than this did . Barney and friends made me quiver in fear , this only put me to sleep.Something with substance , such as American Beuaty , Titus , or Magnolia should be garnering attention . This pretentious poof should be forgotten.Unless of course you 're into mental slumming .	-1
Although I was originally impressed by this film , the more I view it ( on an excellent DVD , by the way ) , the more it seems like a self-indulgent , over acted bit of muck.Schumacher , the director , apparently gets his kicks out of brazenly teasing his audience with his moral outrages coupled with plenty S & amp ; M sexThe musical score is very unusual and quite impressive though .	-1
I guess this is a teen girl film or something , but here is my utterly valueless opinion not being one : Flaw one : what 's the point ? A girl commits herself to an institution . Winona Ryder acts crazy , Angelina Jolie acts crazy , they all act crazy ... .but is n't that what real & quot ; crazy & quot ; people do : ACT crazy ? Basically the people in institutions are playing the game that the doctors set up for them ; they accept their diagnosis as legitimate , take the prescribed psychotropic drugs and electroshock and indulge their & quot ; illness & quot ; as an excuse to vegitate . Basically there is no such thing as mental illness and this film , though unintentionally , drives that fact home.Winona Rider is the & quot ; good & quot ; luny while Angelina Jolie is the & quot ; bad & quot ; luny and they are all playing the game of being suicidal as the doctors indulge their patients ' mind games . This scenario set in the 1960 's has 2 scenes of infinite irony : One , the cab driver says if Rider 's character needs to be committed for seeing things then John Lennon does too . 2 : her boyfriend comes to take her away to Canada where he 's going to avoid the draft . He really drives the nail into this whole mental illness game and speaks the truth to Rider 's character : you 're not crazy . Who are these people to say who 's normal ... indeed.The rest of the film is predictable overly sentimental soap opera . There is no depth to the psychology of the characters ; believe it or not they consider watching & quot ; The Wizard of Oz & quot ; to be some secret communal nirvana experience . That 's as deep as it goes . Also a word on setting consistency : watch the scene when money is displayed ; though the director uses 1960 's cars , he does n't notice the obvious -- the big faced 1990s bills are used for a scene supposedly set in the 1960s . But do n't worry ; to let you know what era it is they show the totally irrelevant ( to this film ) King assassination . Finally a note on the acting . The easiest thing in the world is to act like someone who 's stupid or crazy . They act crazy pretty well , acting as if stupidity were a virtue . For a much better true story showing the abuse of psychiatry see the film , Francis , starring Jessica Lange .	-1
Winona Ryder is far from my favorite actress . I can praise her work in films like Beetle Juice , Lucas and Edward Scissorhands , but I must utterly dismiss her for lackluster performances in films like Age of Innocence and Aliens 4 . In Girl Interrupted Ryder is quite good , but the film is a mixed bag that is dominated by an almost over-the-top , though affecting performance by Angelie Jolie ( as Lisa ) . Her performance is the type of take no prisoners work which sometimes is richly rewarded by the Oscar folks ( and of course , was ) . It 's also the reason to keep watching this film which offers nothing particularly new , but might connect and offer some solace to those who have ever felt alienated by not playing by someone else 's idea of the rules.The film features folks in supporting roles like Whoopie Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave who are n't given much to do and therefore act like they are picking up a check for a t.v . movie of the week.I do n't fault them so much for that , because much of Girl Interrupted feels very much like a t.v . movie of the week or an Afterschool Special . It plays sometimes like a softer , gentler , One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.What I really fault the film for is in it 's numerous continuity errors . I mean glaringly obvious ones that make me wonder if anyone other than Ryder cared as deeply for this project as we 've been led to believe . Supposedly ( and I 've no reason to disbelieve it ) Ryder worked for nearly 7 years to hold onto this project and see that it was brought it to the screen with the care and reverence she felt it deserved . To insure this , she became one of the producers of the project and probably partially financed the rights to the book and most likely sacrificed her normal star salary.The book is written as a string of vignettes , and author Susanna Kayson has a prose voice for capturing small personal details . The vignettes and thoughts add up to make a very affecting book , but the book does n't have a strong narrative . To make a film of the book a more conventional narrative was needed . This narrative could have sharply skewered psychiatry , or become a feminist One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , creating some evil psychiatrist or Nurse Ratchet character.To it 's credit the film does n't do this . It stays truer to the source material than that . When some rich parents ca n't communicate with their children , they sometimes let psychiatric hospitals do their work for them . And that 's essentially the story that is told here.The hospital is not a Snake Pit kind of place . But it is a cold , and sometimes heartless institution . The movie makes the point that one of the main reasons Kaysen was committed to McLean was her possible promiscuity , and her depression which ended with a half hearted suicide attempt involving aspirin and vodka . Men have rarely been considered mentally disturbed for their promiscuity .The film also to its credit does n't romanticize insanity either . We meet characters who are troubled without thinking they are very ` cool ' or destined to be artistic outcasts . Yet we do n't have anyone who warrants our sympathy in terms of a central character . After all , Kaysen admitted herself to the institution , and its clear she was smart enough to pretty quickly play the game well enough to get herself released if she decided it was better dealing with the turbulent 1960 's on the outside , then the cold instutionalism of a high class mental institution . And Ryder 's performances is quiet and even . She let 's Jolie as Lisa and some of the other characters over-emote around her . That 's to her credit on the one hand , but it does n't help us as audience members to care all that much about her.As the central figure of film , rather than as the narrator of the book , Kaysen is who we are most focused on . And she is the least troubled of nearly anyone we meet . We know she 's in pretty good shape and in fact becomes a surrogate big sister to some of the other in-mates in the institution . So where 's the suspenseful conflict ? We know there is n't a really big problem , and we know she is n't in any great danger . Some of the other characters clearly have some major issues , but we do n't get to know or care very much about them.And then there are the continuity errors to really bother those who are paying attention . There are a couple of scenes where you 'll see Ryder as Kaysen lighting a cigarette and smoking and then a few moments later , lighting another cigarette . She 's rarely without a cigarette but to show her constantly lighting up cigarettes is pretty ridiculous , particularly since in one case she 's in the back of a cab , and if she were rapidly chain-smoking , the cab would be thick with smoke , which it isn't.Another one that really bothered me , was later in the film , ( and so as not spoil anything I wo n't go into great details about what else is going in ) , we learn Angelina Jolie as the sociopath Lisa really despises cats . A cat that follows Ryder out for a walk , but when she returns , the cat is inside the apartment where Lisa ( Jolie ) is . Lisa would n't have let the cat back in-she hates cats.. it 's a mistake and mistakes happen but this film is full of continuity errors , which shows a real sloppiness on the director , and editors part.I could n't help but think of times of Jack Arnold 's cult campy classic Switchblade Sisters when Angeline Jolie as Lisa was on screen . She 's chewing the scenery in a barely disguised variation on a bad girl from reform school type of performaance which would have been right at home in a 50 's juvie film or a 70 's woman in prison film.And I could n't help thinking that although parts of Girl Interrupted are well done , and well acted , I would have much rather been watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest or even Switchblade Sisters , then this film.Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

I agree with the Amazon reviewers first two points . its a coocoo 's nest setup and actors love to play loonies so they can get away with over blown performances.would you pay money to be locked in the room with a borderline personality ? HELL NO ! ! ! in real life borderlines are incurable . theyre damage too severe - their personalities too scrambled . fortunately this movie is very inconsistant - and plays fast and loose with the actual mental illness part of the story.really the story is about actresses . you get a borish depressed winona and an agressive bitchy angelina . you may find that entertaining . but i found it dull and annoying .	-1
This movie was terrible . I thought Angelina Jolie 's acting was completely unbelievable . The problem with Winona Ryder is that you can never forget that she is Winona Ryder . Whoopie gave a credible performance but could not save this horrible film . Skip this film !	-1
Another film worth watching just for the performances as both Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder are excellent . I guess I can see why Jolie won the Oscar -- her role was showy and flashy -- but there is now no doubt in my mind that Chloe Sevigny was robbed . As for the film itself , it obviously strives to be a female version of & quot ; One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest & quot ; but the film never attains the impact of the classic because it 's muddled and directionless . And the dialogue is clunky to boot . This is the type of movie where characters are constructed by giving them situations in which they have to argue and throw out descriptive accusations/criticisms at one another . There are a number of moments when the film becomes profound -- such as the examination of how certain actions from boys are perceived as rebellious but the same actions from a girl would be considered insane . I also liked Vanessa Redgrave 's monologue about the fine line between sanity and insanity -- that insanity is really just the overindulgence of one 's own preoccupations . But ironically , that point only serves to weaken the movie as it raises the question of how people so preoccupied with themselves can make such incisive observations about one another .	-1
In a movie that is 127 minutes long , we should be given a clear explanation of why Winona Ryder 's character belongs in a mental hospital . Instead , we 're thrown into the middle of everything , when her parents are considering the option of admitting her into the insane asylum.The predictability of & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; does n't help itself at all . Of course , she does n't think that she belongs in a ward , even though she admitted to her doctor that she swallowed an entire carton of aspirin , and that was before she drank a bottle of vodka , all because she had a headache . All movies in this category ( and believe me , there are more than you would think ) have the inmate going through a period of denial leading up to an eventual feeling of belonging.The character development behind almost everyone in & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; ended up being another very weak link , and , in a very dark drama that is based on a true story , this is a critical element that just is n't up to par , and that really hurts it . Like I said earlier , we need to know why Winona Ryder 's character is going through this stage of depression , and we need to know what part of the phase is so unbearable that she ca n't handle it on her own . I remember the word & quot ; blue & quot ; being used when her feelings were being described , and that word falls short of description that would constitute someone needing to go to a mental institution . In a big world like this , there are people that are n't able to cope with certain things all by themselves , and that is what her character is supposed to evoke . In reality , I know of two people who have been through experiences in life that were too difficult to be dealt with alone , and , when the topic of the drama that they are going through comes up , the word & quot ; blue & quot ; would n't be enough to describe what they were going through . She is playing a 17-18 year old ( even though she was 28 during the filming ) in 1967 who is dealing with the problems that everyone faces at that age . Everyone faces those problems , and everyone deals with them . It 's a little thing called the real world , and , if her character ca n't adjust to it , then I , as the viewer , do n't care whether or not she gets over her problem or not , because it all comes off as a bunch of complaining.Acting was n't good either . Angelina Jolie was supposed to appear to be insane , but her character was really just an idiot , which is completely different from insanity . Jack Nicholson in & quot ; The Shining & quot ; is insanity ; Angelina Jolie in & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; is an idiot . At one point in the movie , an inmate told someone to call her a cab , and he called her cab , as it were a name , and she went bizerk , laughing . Insane ? No . Idiotic ? Very.So , overall , I have enough real problems and complaints now , and I do n't need to hear the petty , superficial ones that are poorly portrayed in this movie . If I were anything like anyone in this movie , then I would go crazy every time I had the most subtle , unthreatening problem . Stay away from this movie . It is boring , annoying and without any strength of conviction .	-1
If you 're familiar , even in passing , with Christopher 's Hampton 's stage play Les Liaisons Dangereuses ( based on the 18th century novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos ) or its subsequent ( and very popular ) film incarnation , Dangerous Liaisons starring the insanely brilliant Glenn Close as the black hearted Marquise de Merteuil and , in my opinion , the miscast John Malkovich as the lascivious and callous bon-vivant , Vicomte de Valmont than you can easily forego seeing this rather inept and not surprisingly insipid modernization and blithely go about your business . Something has definitely been lost in translation and it extends far beyond period costumes and Bach 's keyboard concertos . Though a teenager 's ability to descend the depths of cruelty is well known and documented , rarely is it of the sophisticated and viciously calculated variety , such as is the case here . Furthermore , we 're not dealing with pawns that live within the sheltered environs and cloistered walls of 18th century France , but rather modern adolescents living rather privileged existences in one of the world 's most modern and sophisticated cities , New York . They 're hardly as gullible as pious 15 year old girls reared in convents . Pulling the wool over their collective eyes is going to take considerable effort not to mention near Machiavellian craftiness . In this retelling , both the plot and characters reek of artifice and you do n't know whether to laugh or take the film seriously . It has nothing to do with the performances but rather with everything leading up to them , primarily a script that aches to be modern , yet is often times burdened with some stilted and archaic dialogue as if it 's trying to hearken back to and somehow channel its original source . I mean , how many 16 year olds nowadays do you know of that write actual letters ? I do n't mean emails or text messages , I mean physical letters ? In short , the film , more often than not , suffers from an identity crisis . The actors were more than decent and they did their best considering the material they were given and the soundtrack is n't at all bad , either . In closing , the movie is hardly dreadful and it can be rather entertaining but , again , if you 're familiar with the 1988 Stephen Frears ' film or to a lesser extent Milos Forman 's Valmont of a few years later , you 'll find yourself squinting through Cruel Intentions , vainly and understandably searching for remnants of either film and their respective characters and will be left feeling somewhat frustrated by the exercise .	-1
YET ANOTHER `` INDIE '' FILM ; THIS ONE A COMING OF AGE STORY OF 4 FRIENDS . SHOULD HAVE MADE 1 OR 2 OF THE 4 GUYS GAY TO MAKE IT AT LEAST A LITTLE INTERESTING . A CROSS BETWEEN THE OUTSIDERS AND THE LAST PICTURE SHOW . THIS MOVIE WAS AS DULL AND BORING AS THE TOWN !	-1
This was a pretty so-so movie and boring . These guys make better movies . They need better stories or screen writers .	-1
A typical overused plot idea , and while John Candy is a good actor , somehow his jokes fall flat . Maybe I 've heard them all before . Or maybe by now , all the plot situations are familiar .	-1
I watched this over the weekend . I remember having seen it as a teenager . The weird thing was , I remembered virtually nothing about this movie . The only thing I could recall was Hudson 's unusual stack of earrings on one ear , that it had Sandra Bernhard in it and that she was annoying , and that Bruce Willis sang in it.Well having watched it again , I can see why I forgot everything . This movie is awful . Terrible , really . I was surprised at how bad it is . I like Bruce Willis and was expecting more from a movie made during the height of his career . I would have thought him to really be on top of his game here . But this one 's a dud.As I watched , I kept trying to figure out what this movie is trying to be . Is it action ? Or a comedy ? Or a weird mix of both ? As an action movie it certainly has plenty of it , but the story is confusing and the characters are too cartoony , the villains too campy to be taken seriously . So is it a comedy ? Maybe . It sure has plenty of comedic elements going on . Lots of scenes that could be called *comedy* in the broad usage of the term . The only problem is that none of it seems funny . Not once in this movie did I laugh or even smile . The jokes as they are all fall flat.So it 's an action-comedy . I guess I could say that the comedy just is n't to my taste . Some people might think it is hilarious . Or might like it in a so-bad-it's-good way . To me , it failed to hit the bar to make it as a decent comedy movie , yet also failed to be bad enough to qualify as so-bad-it's-good . It 's not good . But it 's worse than bad - it 's mediocre . A movie that is bad but also too boring to watch.The plot is confusing . But after a while you just do n't care.I got ta say , I did like some of the actors I saw here . It was kind of cool to see Frank Stallone . I also liked Andie MacDowell ( what a babe ! ) . And I really enjoyed watching Sandra Bernhard , for what little screen time she got . She was entertaining to watch . I also could n't help but notice that she 's smoking hot , in an unconventional sort of way . I have to give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 just for these two actresses.So yeah , just a weird movie . I see a lot of rave reviews here , which leave me scratching my head . No offense to you guys who like this movie . I just did n't get it .	-1
I would like to sell it back to you ! ! Bell book & candle is charming fascinating story of a New York witch putting a spell on a guy to entice love . Not demonic like charmed -the Siamese cat should of won best actor .-James Stewart with nervous scrawny dry old grey indecisive man who was NEVER good enough to romance any LEADING LADY let alone Kim -THAT STUPID DUM LOOK ON HIS FACE featured on cover says it all . Kim is always a very sensual attractive actress but should of done more magic tricks.Performances from Elsa Lancaster and Jack Lemmon was their typical usual funny selves.The story dragged on ..location .scenes were restricted to the shop- nightclub - lounge & roof top better suited to stage play-	-1
Viewed : 5/14Rate : 45/14 : Bell , Book , and Candle gets a weak ` 4 ' from me despite the wonderful repairing of Jimmy Stewart and the ever good looking Kim Novak ( but her eyebrows ... .eek ) after their timeless work in Vertigo . I wish they are given a better angle to work under because the magic stuff is quite stupid and boring . It is akin to a deflated tire that makes the going a sluggish ride . That 's how it happened in Bell , Book , and Candle . Moreover , it does n't help matters any to see the awful supporting characters . At least the siamese cat is the versatile star of the show . Billed as comedy , the film is n't a one ; probably it 's because Kim Novak does n't know how to be funny in the same way Jimmy Stewart can be . All in all , Bell , Book , and Candle is a very good looking picture but suffers from a ridiculous storyline .	-1
Am I the only one who noticed that Sherilyn 's carpet did n't match her drapes , if you get my drift ?	-1
Jagged Edge has n't aged that well . The courtroom scenes look silly now . Jeff Bridges ' character is on trial for the murder of his wife and her maid . We never hear the maid 's name , we never see even a brief shot of her relatives . If found not guilty of his wife 's murder apparently the court will toss out the maid 's case as a freebie . Later Glen Close 's character looks up and sees a tired and sad looking black woman sitting in the back of the court and she 's dressed like it 's 1962 . I thought that was particularly lame . The minority characters are just symbols in this movie.Ignoring the court room scenes for a moment I have to say that Peter Coyote gives a stand out performance . I also liked the old cop played by Robert Loggia . Glen Close is playing a smart woman who does two really dumb things : You do n't get romantic with your client and you do n't let your emotions concerning a past case ruin your understanding of the case you 're working on now.Nevertheless , Glen falls hard for her client and the scene where she looks in the linen closet and realizes that hot dangit , she 's got a sadistic rapist and murderer for a lover is the best in the movie . The final scene is quite good as well . When the glass in Glen 's front door is smashed it 's gasp and jump in your seat time . Jagged Edge is an okay but not especially memorable movie . Unless you have to have all of Glen Close 's movies it 's not worth buying .	-1
I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and being awed by it . WOW ! Daredevils against all odds ; traitors among them ! Saboteurs hanging from a cliff ! Nazis falling like bowling pins ! Guns exploding , crashing down to the sea ! Great movie score.. ! With those memories intact I saw it again last night , and O brother ... As the tango says , `` fierce is time 's revenge '' , for what was once exciting and fun , fifty years later one finds it dated , slow , and boring.Irate comments , though , ensue if you dare state this self-evident fact . Most staunch reviews here in this forum seem to defend those shared childhood reminiscences more than the film itself , which in truth is quite awful . `` Guns of Navarone '' , together with with `` Around the World in 80 Days '' , `` The Longest Day '' , `` Ulysses '' , `` It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad World '' , and `` Polar Station Zebra '' , belong to that curious film genre called `` Best leave them marvelous in your memories '' . Otherwise , it 's a rude awakening .	-1
I am not a fan of Melanie Griffith at all , in fact , the only film I really like her in is & quot ; Working Girl & quot ; . It 's not that she is a terrible actress . She is just annoying . So why did I waste over 2 hours of my time watching this movie ? I am now asking myself the same thing . I was n't sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy . If it was , it was n't even funny . Griffith , plays Lucille , a woman who is beaten by her husband . She kills him and cuts his head off ... Why ? I have no idea . Maybe she 's crazy ? She then decides to leave her 7 children in the hands of her mother so she can go out to Hollywood and live out her dream of becoming a glamerous actress . She takes the head of her husband along for the ride ... why not ? Nothing else makes sense so far so why not make less sense . This film is just a mishmash of nonsense . She wins a lot of money in Las Vegas right before she gets to California . She eventually gets her big break ... She is on t.v . Then , she gets caught..eventually all criminals do . I do n't know what the ending of this movie is all about ... She goes free ? when she was sentenced to a term in prison ? Maybe the book is better , I hope so , cuz this was a boring movie . I watched it on cable ... .thank god i waited that long.The only bright spot was Lucas Black , the boy from Sling Blade . He is one of the best child actors right now . I hope to see more of him in films . He is very charming . I personally would n't recommend this film .	-1
Completely predictable Hollywood version of the famous swashbuckler , the focus is on the snappy one-liners and the sweeping swordfights . But somewhere between bending over backwards to make sure that we take Zeta-Jones ' character seriously ( she 's from the 1800s , but has the confidence and power that a modern gender-conscious audience demands ) and bending over backwards to make sure that we take Anthony Hopkins ' character seriously ( he may be an old drunk man , but he can fight like the devil once he finds his inspiration ) , this movie lost me .	-1
I saw this movie in the theater , and thought it was great , but when I bought it on DVD , I just could not bear watching it again.If yo uhave n't seen this movie , rent it , or better yet borrow it , but do n't buy it .	-1
Okay . So it 's a Friday night , and I want to settle down with a good horror flick . John Carpenter 's & quot ; Vampires & quot ; looked to fit the bill : horror , humor , and what looked like some interesting twists in the plot ( ie , vampire hunters working for the Catholic church ) . Boy , was I wrong . Certainly , the opening scenes with James Woods swaggering in those tight jeans , leather jacket , and sunglasses lent an interesting machismo , but as the film progressed , the plot and imagery deteriorated rapidly , and frankly became quite disturbing . Some brief examples ... Sheryl Lee plays a prostitute bitten by Valek , the original 'master ' vampire . Apparently , although not dead , she will & quot ; turn & quot ; within 48 hours ; Woods and Daniel Baldwin want to use her psychic link with Valek to find and destroy him before he obtains the & quot ; black cross & quot ; and be able to live in the daylight . Lee is therefore dragged , slapped , stripped and degraded ; yet , Baldwin inexplicably falls in love with her with no real explanation or character development ( maybe the actor 's fault ? ) . The film also has a love-hate relationship with the Catholic church : priests are slapped around and degraded ( at least they 're not stripped ) , and the brief religious mention at the end of the film does n't redeem the basic message of violence . The villains , except for Valek , are indistinct ; the special effects and editing are choppy . And if you do n't guess the three lines Woods says to Baldwin at the end of the film , you do n't get out much ( hint : it begins & quot ; I will hunt you down ... ) . & quot ; Buffy & quot ; and & quot ; Angel & quot ; on television pack more of a punch .	-1
From the very start you can tell this is one of those weird-acting movies where they do n't go into any of the characters and yet expect you to empathize when they are all killed in the first ten minutes . Does n't work , I 'm afraid . The Catholic conspiracy is about the only good thing ... the relationship between the hooker and Woods ' right hand man is VERY bizarre . To top it all off , the head vampire is that annoying guy from & quot ; Karate Kid III & quot ;	-1
If you poke through the customer ratings here , you 'll notice a common theme ( with some exceptions , of course ) : people who read the John Steakley book on which this film is ( loosely ) based hate the film , and folks who 've never read the book love it . I read the book just this past week and liked it a lot ( though it has its own share of flaws ) , and had to see the flick after finishing the novel . While I do n't think this film is terrible , it 's not anywhere near as good as it would have been had Carpenter followed the original story a bit more closely . Just about everything that made the novel special , especially the characterization of the main character Jack Crow , is gone here . Fans of the flick may be surprised to know that Crow is not the flaming a**hole in the book he is here . I found it hard to have any sympathy for Crow or his assistant Montoya . They 're supposed to be hardened by the horrors they 've witnessed and committed , but instead they just come off as self-centered cretins . ( Despite the fact that James Woods is absolutely the perfect choice for the role of Crow . ) That said , even if you 've never read the book , you 'll still find some flaws that ca n't be overlooked . Sheryl Lee overacts something terrible in her role as the prostitue slowly becoming a vampire , and the ending is absolutely ludicrous , defying the film 's own internal logic . Most of the action sequences are done as montages ( ! ) , and the gore is a bit too over-the-top . Maximillian Schell is a fine actor , but his character ( who is n't in the novel ) was unconvincing and obviously merely a walking , talking plot device . There are some heartpounding moments here , like the opening sequence ( one of the few scenes taken pretty much directly from the novel ) and Thomas Ian Griffith makes a nicely scary vampire , even if he 's given about three lines in the whole flick . His origin ( which leads into the origin of vampires in general ) is also quite intriguing . But that 's not enough to save the film.Of course , anybody who 's never read the novel will disagree strongly with this . If you do n't know what 's been left out , you can enjoy this as a particularly violent , not particularly well thought-out but reasonably satisfying action/horror B pic . Nothing wrong with that.A word about the commentary : this is the most useless and dull director 's commentary I 've yet to hear . Carpenter goes it alone , and with no one to prod him into saying anything interesting all we get is comments like & quot ; Even though this was supposed to take place at night , we shot it during the day & quot ; ( ad nauseam ) and constant exhortations to listen to the ( Carpenter-composed ) soundtrack . I would have liked to know why he deviated so far from the source material - that would have made an interesting story .	-1
Mechagodzilla would have been better if he was the villian and Godzilla was the hero . Rodan makes an appearance and so that is good . Rodan is too small in this one and it felt like it was the same as the previous movies . It is kind of boring and dull .	-1
This film comes as a great disappointment following G vs . MG . Many elements contribute to the sickeningly sweet tone that pervades almost every frame : the Barney-esque appearance of Little Godzilla , the romance that developes between Miki and G-Force soldier Shindo , the music score , the new incarnation of Mogera , etc..The spfx are not up to the previous entries ' standards ( the outer space duel between SG and Mogera being a lowlight ) despite the presence of several impressive matte shots and some well done monster action ( SG 's gravity tornado ) . The editing suffers as well , allowing parts of the film to drag on too long ( G 's first appearance and the final battle ) . The score , though servicable , does not compliment the action as well as Ifukube 's cues did previously.Despite all of this , the film is still fun . Its softer tone may prove nostalgic to those who favor Godzilla 's & quot ; hero & quot ; films of the 1970 's . The Big Guy looks good and fearsome and the last fight between G , SG , and Mogera is quite an entertaining monster mash.Though disappointing to senior kaiju addicts , this is definitely one for the up-and-coming G-fans in your home .	-1
I expected this to be more like Spamalot than it was . It became very tedious and labored in its attempts to be funny . The deliberate anachronisms did n't help .	-1
Well , I 've just spent the better part of two hours reading up on this disc from many different sources.BELIEVE what you have heard . This disc is DEFECTIVE . Subtitles do appear on the screen , even when they are turned off.My copy is going back.The company has yet to recall the defective discs . So the only logical thing to do is not purchase the movie.A wonderful film , but this edition is UNACCEPTABLE !	-1
Reading reviews prior to purchasing this two pack , I learned that they are pan and scan and English language only.This is pretty much a massive mistake on TriStar/Columbia 's part . Classic Media releasedThe Godzilla Collectionwhich has BOTH versions of all 7 films in the set . That is , it includes the edited English language video where applicable and ALSO includes the uncut Japanese versions as well . Why would n't TriStar do this ? I guess we have hope , at least a little bit . Columbia TriStar is owned by Sony . Classic Media is owned by guess who ... Sony ! If we are lucky , the Godzilla movies Classic Media released in 2007 are an indication of work being done on other classic Godzilla movies that have n't gotten proper DVD treatment.If you are a fan looking for the Japanese versions of the films ( either/or uncut video and Japanese audio ) , look for Region 3 DVD releases . If you 're looking for proper widescreen formats in the English language , well , you 're pretty much out of luck . Sure , the English dub is `` bad '' but we expect that usually in Godzilla films . For me , Columbia/TriStar releasing these two 90s Godzilla classics on a single disc , then butchering them further with just a pan and scan ( 4:3 aspect ratio , not widescreen ) is an insult to Godzilla fans.Avoid this release . Even at the current Amazon price it is n't worth the pain.I suppose if you have kids who like Godzilla , they wo n't mind 4:3 aspect ratios an English only . If you are a fan of what Classic Media pulled off on their releases though , this will leave a bitter taste in your mouth .	-1
GARDENS OF STONE ( 1987 ) Produced and Directed by Francis Ford Coppola . Score by Carmine Coppola.Starring James Caan , Anjelica Huston , Dean Stockwell , Mary Stuart Masterson , Lonette McKee , Laurence Fishburne and James Earl Jones.The film purports to be about the U. S. Army 's Old Guard who handle the burial detail of veterans at Arlington cemetery and three sergents -- two older and one young and the various women and others in their lives during the Vietnam War in the late 60s.Actually what it is is a great -- though not unclever -- Trojan Horse as Coppola -- perhaps disatisfied with how APOCALYPSE NOW came out -- makes another go at the Commie prop Anti Vietnam War film . However it is now 1987 and Ronald Reagan is reducing the Soviet Union to the dust of history and millions are being liberated ... ... ... except for Indochina . And so we have a great many Liberals with egg on their faces who have spent the last two decades smearing the American Soldier and generally making an ass of themselves . So how can we relieve them of the responsibility of their actions ? Well how about the old rhetorical ploy of reversing reality -- when in danger of losing a debate simply accuse your opponent of being what they are against and against what they are for . To wit : A patriotic American is really anti-American . A conservative is really a fascist . Christians are just like Moslem Barbarians . Or here . Have the main military characters be against the Vietnam War . Instead of having the teenage character be the font of wisdom before hapless adults , have the adults be the wise ones ... ... ..as long as it is the teen who supports the war while the adults oppose it . Portray the military characters in a positive light and not as drooling incompetent drug addled Nazi baby killer rapists ... ... ..but only those that agree with the Party Line . Those who support the War are still drooling incompetent drug addled Nazi baby killer rapists but only offscreen . And finally have the main military character approve of the Leftist antiwar character ( who earlier referred to American 's actions in the War as genocide ) when she tells him that she will do everything in her power to insure America 's defeat to such a degree that he asks her to marry her . SEE ? ? ? The Left are not anti-military ! ! We portrayed two soldiers in a good light and even allowed one of our women to associate with him ! ! SEE ? ? We did not betray the country and the Vietnamese people . The Military ( or rather one member of the military ) agrees with us ! ! ! It was not our fault ! ! We were right ! ! We are always right ... ... ..even when we are wrong.Coppola goes through the motions of pretending to present all sides of the issues but the dialogue is incredibly shallow and empty . Really just variations of `` I 'M FER IT ! ! I 'M AGIN IT ! ! '' repeted ad nauseum . A serious discussion of the Vietnam War pro and con is NOT a conversation Coppola wants to have . The War is presented as being somehow different from all other wars ... ... ..but no one ever says why . Caan 's character is against the War because it is not being fought right ... ... ..but never explains the right way . The young pro-war sergent 's position is little more than `` We beat Hitler..therefore ... ... '' It becomes very obvious by the 75 minute mark that the filmmakers simply do not understand the miliary characters at the heart of the film and are flailing to make them appear human . And the Liberal characters constantly weigh in with their condescending little barbs ( It 's genocide . Anyone who supports the War is immature and ignorant . Soldiers returning from Vietnam are ... .different ... .presumably from all that drooling baby killing . Masterson has a ludicrous speech about returning Vets where I swear I expected her to start intoning `` Even a man who is pure at heart ... ... .. '' ) without ever getting called on it . And it is telling that the film stacks the deck with practically EVERYBODY in the film except the young sergent being against the War ... ... .and even he is made to recant his position at the end ... ... .where upon since he is obviously a drooling nazi hophead baby killer , is killed lest his evil infect the good liberal Masterson with his touch.Aside from the score -- -which is truly hideous -- one can not say the acting is bad . Huston as the smarmy Washington Post reporter has an impossible role ... ... .and makes it work . Caan is good as is Jagger and the rest . And Jones could not give a bad performance if he wanted to . The film looks very nice visually but what sinks it ultimately is the script . Coppola simply does not have the integrity to even attempt a fair debate on the War.The film is not about the War , the abatoir in Indochina , the men who fought it ... ... and in some cases were laid to eternal rest in Arlington having made the ultimate sacrifice for human freedom . It is not about the Old Guard . It is not about that Garden of Stone in Arlington and the men resting there . The film is not about what it pretends to be about.It is about a bunch of useful idiots and functional children who made a great big mess on the floor of the world stage and now want Daddy to make it all better and tell them it was not their fault.It is all very childish and petty.HOWEVER unlike THE KILLING FIELDS , they do not play IMAGINE at the end.See it or not .	-1
A problem with message movies such as these is that they tread a fine line between being too much of their time and being universal . While this film caused quite a stir in 1967 , watching it today is painful and cringe inducing . It 's strictly a product of its time.The story of an interracial couple ( Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton ) marrying was very radical in 1967 , but today it 's much more accepted . Things are certainly not perfect , but they are much more tolerant than they were 40 years ago . It is important to note that this film was n't done for cheap shock value . Stanley Kramer , the director and producer of the film , was a filmmaker who made socially conscious works throughout most of his career , so a film like this was a natural choice for him . Unfortunately , the film is so dated and so obvious that it 'll make modern audiences cringe . The screenplay ( which won an Oscar ! ) is trite and never goes beyond a sitcom level . The film plays almost like a `` very special '' episode of a sitcom . It takes a worthy subject and makes it as inoffensive as oatmeal . It 's so blanded down . It 's mawkish and overly sentimental as well , which makes it even worse.It 's interesting to contrast this film with a film Poitier made the same year , and that 's To Sir , With Love . He plays an American teaching in a tough East End London school . That film , while a bit corny at times , has n't dated nearly as much as this one , mainly because Poitier 's race is only mentioned once , and just for a few seconds ( there 's a scene where he cut himself , and one of his students foolishly says `` oh , he bleeds red '' ) . To Sir , With Love never telegraphs its punches like Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner does.Many of Kramer 's films have dated . The films of Otto Preminger , another filmmaker who made socially conscious films , have n't dated at all and are still quite potent in their depiction of politics ( his brilliant Advise and Consent ) , the Israeli/Palestinian conflict ( Exodus ) , and drug addiction ( The Man with the Golden Arm ) . Preminger 's work never resorted to maudlin sentimentality ( something screenwriter Dalton Trumbo , who wrote Exodus , admired about Otto ) , and as a result his work is still valid today . While I admire Kramer 's sincerity and choice of subject matter , I ca n't recommend this film . A shame , as it has 3 of the greatest actors to grace the silver screen , and it 's Spencer Tracy 's last film . All 3 of them are excellent , doing their best to make this pap watchable . It 's a pity the film is n't better .	-1
I wish I had read the other reviews here first before purchasing this version . Where Oh Where is the original grumpy Father Christmas ? What stupid block-head thought the voice needed to be changed ? They RUINED the whole thing.Let me know when the original is released , because I loved the grumpy Santa .	-1
The original I Know what you did Last Summer was scary , suspensful , and interesting . This sequel is so bad , I do n't know what I can say to caution you strongly away from it . Problem number one : There just are n't enough characters to sustain interest . Brandi , a definitely talented and charismatic actress/singer is totally wasted in her role . Jennifer Love Hewitt will grind relentlessly on your nerves , and your sympathy level for her plight will become nonexistent . Instead you will feel as if you , the viewer , are trapped on that island ... .and bored out of your mind .	-1
You know , if they try to be like Friday the 13 movies with all the sequals , i would not be surprised that in 20 years , they make one where the stalker has alsymers disease and I think they should call it & quot ; I DO N'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID THAT SUMMER & quot ; -Sometin ' Kool	-1
Just watched this the other night for poops and giggles , holy jesus it 's awful . You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them . Really it 's so unremarkable , so what 's the appeal ? Well the first one was a big success , so obviously it 's riding on the coat tails , but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.Really it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was , from the opening 'jump scare ' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class , I knew I was in for a craptacular 90 's slasher . So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12 . The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious . `` Ohhh she 's so sweet and innocent , she deserves to live , but the fat stoner deserves to DIE ! Take that people I passively look down on ! `` .Also in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers wo n't be interested , so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it 's just the dark , but wait , it 's the corner of a club with couches and everything , and no one 's sitting there ? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.So eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever , for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive , the maid for example ignores white virgin , `` oooooh , how creepy , she does n't respond '' F*** you that 's stupid . Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible , even though his business seems to be going into the crapper . Then they meet Jack Black playing himself , and the guy seems friendly enough , basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some , then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie ' , there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.So much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production , even the kills are PG-13 caliber ( well by today 's standards ) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing , something ? I do n't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around , apparently as fan service to the girls watching . Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL , or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.Then later we meed biker chick who runs the bar , and while virgin white gurrrl lives , random biker chick is killed off , because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you 'll likely get murdered if you live like that . Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.So OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER , no f***ing s*** , who did n't see that coming a mile away ? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience `` hey I 'm still here '' , then finally shows that he 's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who could n't tell and puts his EVIL FACE ! ! ! on . This wimp is the least threating villain ever , and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever , I stopped paying attention at this point , this movie SUCKS ! I put as much thought into this review as they did into this movie .	-1
Why do some directors and writers of horror movies think it 's fair to completely annoy their audiences with these ambiguous endings , so that even though you may have enjoyed the movie , you hate the resolution ! It 's such a cop out . It 's like they 're telling you , the third in the series is coming out . Unfortunately , this particular series should probably stop . I liked the first movie a lot ; it was suspenseful , imaginative , and pretty scary . The acting was generally better too . This time around , the acting and script are pretty irritating . First of all , anyone who knows their geography will get a big clue early in the film . Secondly , Freddie Prinze 's character is such a jerk in the beginning , you ca n't believe his sudden transformation . Third , I figured out the villain very early in the film , so there was little suspense . The acting overall is lame ; Jennifer Love Hewitt has decided to join Neve Campbell in the & quot ; I 'm only doing this for the money , and I 'm really wasting my time in this silly horror movie. & quot ; She does look a lot like Kate Jackson in this one , though . Freddie Prinze is absolutely awful , completely unconvincing , and a pretty shoddy hero , to boot . The guy who plays Titus is an offensive , stereotypical insult to intelligent viewers , providing none of the comic relief the director obviously wanted . Jeffrey Combs , who was so good in the & quot ; Reanimator & quot ; movies looks as bored as Miss Hewitt , and does nothing to pad his resume . Three actors do manage to rise above their material : Jennifer Esposito as Nancy , the barmaid is very good ; Brandy is surprisingly effective as Julie 's best friend , although her character does become annoying and stupid ; and Matthew Settle as the good-natured Bill is very effective . I still think Gorton 's should sue for using their fisherman image , but it is a horror movie . That 's what so sad . It could have been a lot better , but it 's too predictable and a little too gory , as well . When all is said and done , & quot ; Halloween & quot ; and & quot ; A Nightmare on Elm Street & quot ; ( the first in the series ) are still the benchmarks for modern horror movies !	-1
Director : Danny CannonCast : Jennifer Love Hewitt , Freddie Prinze Jr. , Brandy Norwood , Mekhi Phifer , Muse Watson , Bill Cobbs , Mathew Settle , Jeffrey Combs , Jennifer Esposito.Running Time : 100 minutesRated R for intense terror violence and gore , strong language and some drug use.It might not have been the greatest movie ever made but , thanks to the canny direction and score , `` I Know What You Did Last Summer '' was a very effective thriller . Shame the same ca n't be said of this sequel , which crams in every slasher clich & eacute ; known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff . In a fit of apparent desperation , writer Trey Callaway packs Julie ( Hewitt ) , survivor of the first film , off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number . Joining her is fish-faced Karla ( Brandy ) , her boyfriend Tyrell ( Mekhi Pfeiffer , who I seem to remember used to have a promising career ) and spare wheel Will ( Matthew Settle ) . Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman , who engineered the prize ( the fact that Julie 's number 's unlisted does n't set off any warning bells ) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other . There are no boats scheduled for days , the phones do n't work , and there 's a storm on the way ... you get the picture.You can practically hear director Danny Cannon , whose last movie was the underrated `` Judge Dredd '' and who deserves a lot better than this , sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is . Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing ( it 's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings ) ; a couple good scares throughout , though nothing scary , as if any movie could be deemed such ; Freddie Prinze , Jr. is certainly not a notable talent , yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero ; Mekhi Phifer , in a stereotype black tough-guy role , gives his role some enjoyable attitude , but his disbelief of Julie 's claims that a killer 's on the loose become tiring and cruel . `` I Still Know ... '' fails due to a maddening lack of logic , intelligence , and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters ; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we do n't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed ; technically mediocre acting ( except Hewitt ) , plus bothersome , forgettable work from newcomer Brandy ; low-IQ script ; splotches of incompetent directing throughout ; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying `` shocker '' finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years . Our only consolation is that it may just be a dream , a la the `` surprise '' ending of the first `` I Know What You Did Last Summer '' ... I guess we 'll find out if and when `` I Still Know What You Did Lots of Summers Ago '' is made .	-1
The Net starring Sandra Bullock was a great thriller when it was released in 1995 . Bullock was at the height of her career and this film was probably only a hit for that reason alone . And yes I was and still a huge fan of Bullock but I have to admit The Net is very dated and silly now . The plotline is a little far fetched and contrived but Bullock 's spunky and fearless performance saves this boring little film .	-1
this film should have been more interesting considering the subject of the net but it gets stuck in Junk Mail cliches and never recovers.Sandra Bullock never could act and follows the Pattern here.a good idea gone frozen .	-1
Wow . I had to force myself to sit through this screechfest of crummy composition , hideous singing , cliched dancing , and stupid dialog . I 'm pretty easy-going with films generally . I like classics , I like theatre , I 've worked professionally in music and have a lot of music education in my background , and I even come from an entertainment industry family , having known Elvis , Ann-Margaret and Dick Van Dyke in my childhood . ( Note - Elvis is n't in this movie ; it 's based on him , essentially . ) I still would say this is actually irritating to try to watch . I kept thinking it somehow must get better , since it 's considered such a great classic . I simply ca n't figure this one out at all . Even the technical aspects of the film seem irritating , from the editing , to the choreography , the direction ( really bad ! ) , set design , costumes ; all really bad to the point of making you just lean back and go `` ewwwww '' . I will say you can not knock the performers themselves , they do a good job considering , and are just following direction.I 'd recommend that if you want to try it , give it 5 or 10 minutes and if you are n't into it by then , it 's not going to get any better .	-1
I just watched this movie for the first time in many years . I never liked it when it first came out , and time has n't changed my opinion . I love the show . It was a near-perfect musical comedy in an era when near-perfect musical comedies happened frequently -- witness MY FAIR LADY , WEST SIDE STORY , THE MUSIC MAN , FUNNY GIRL , etc . But this got Hollywoodized drastically . Suddenly the focus shifted to Kim McAfee and Hugo Peabody ( Ann-Margret and Bobby Rydell ) and Albert Peterson and Rosie were pushed into the `` also ran '' category . Jesse Pearson as Conrad Birdie was far , far inferior to Dick Gautier in the original . ( I never saw the show on Broadway , but rather the touring company , in which both Gautier and Kay Medford [ Mae Peterson , Albert 's domineering mother ] reprised their roles from the original cast . Dick Patterson and Gretchen Wyler had the two leads . ) The subject matter is too pass & eacute ; now for it ever to be refilmed . Too bad . I 'd love to have a DVD of a new version , which would hopefully stick to the original story .	-1
This movie really was n't that great because a whole hour goes by before the car really does anything special . Christine could have had the potential to be a good movie but , it turned out to be kind of , to be frank : BORING ! . I wo n't lie , I liked the part where Christine got revenge on the guys that tore her apart but , as a whole the movie just did n't measure up to my expectations .	-1
I liked the book a lot , and was excited about the movie , but it turned out to be a dissapointment . The characters were very bad and did n't really fit the part , and terrible acting . The car was still pretty cool , but they changed so much stuff in the movie , it was kinda boring . Maybe I was expecting too much , or maybe it was bad , but my opinion is do n't get it .	-1
Sorry that I got this . I did n't laugh much at it in the 70 's and I 'm not laughing at it much today either it seems..	-1
This film was touted as a fantastic dark comedy . I got the dark part . I 'm still waiting on most of the comedy . It was very well acted and I 'd even say finely directed ... but something was missing . The plot just did not seem to go anywhere after such a strong setup and such stellar presentation of rich characters . I look forward to seeing where this ensemble goes from here , as everyone in it shone . I just wish the darkness could have shed some light on a plot .	-1
This movie was quite spectacular when it was made , I 'm sure . But now it 's a bit boring and out of touch . It really does a good job with arriving and departing trains though .	-1
I 've waited for years to get this wonderful classic on DVD and was so disappointed to discover it 's only available in a full-screen format . For those who do n't know the difference , this classic was originally filmed in a widescreen format , so to make it fit the traditional square television , they had to crop out a lot of the picture . What 's more , this `` restored '' version contains no documentaries -- only trailers and cast lists . I e-mailed Sony about a possible widescreen release and was told there are no plans for another release at this time . What a shame ! The film was released on VHS in a widescreen format and deserved to be handled with the same respect in the DVD release . If you want to get the full impact of the theatrical release , do n't buy this chopped-up version . Save your money and watch the VHS or widescreen airings on Turner Classic Movies . Eventually someone will do right by this film and release a better DVD .	-1
I had difficulty arriving at a title for this review as this film is flawed in so many aspects . I recall watching a tv series entitled `` Hollywood and the Stars '' , a retrospective on films throughout the 20th century - Picnic was included as a significant one in the 1950 's . I 've watched Picnic perhaps a dozen times and with each viewing I am more perplexed as to why it was not and , more significantly , still is not critically blasted.For starters let me answer the question I am sure will come up - why watch it so many times if I think so poorly of it ? I must be honest : the film does have a certain appeal . Steve Allen 's variation of Moonglow is a charming tune that permeates the film and I still enjoy the rather corny little vignettes from the picnic itself . Perhaps they harken back to a more peaceful , simple time in America . And to be fair the Novak-Holden dance at the picnic is something I still enjoy . Or maybe it 's as simple as getting enjoyment out of watching something badly done ( I refer the reader to `` Parrish '' ! ) . I 'm not sure . However , the more I 've watched it the more flawed it becomes.First and perhaps foremost , William Holden is badly miscast in his role as the down and out `` young man '' reappearing after years of absence to his old college buddy . Holden is way too old for this part . In addition he is constantly made to be performing all sorts of `` youthful '' activities , spontaneously sprinting around , doing push-ups , etc. , as if he had so much boundless energy it could n't be contained . In actuality the effect creates the impression that he requires a stop at the nearest rest room . To make matters even worse he attempts to demonstrate a dance step to his ( underage ) picnic date by vigorously clapping his hands and grotesquely twisting his torso totally out of time with the music . To paraphrase the famous Shakespeare line : `` He doth protest too much '' .Secondly , the dialog by just about every character is incredibly hokey . To go into detail would be impractical . To name a few , Holden 's story of being picked up by two women ostensibly for sex , ultimately for robbery , is just not believable . I 've been picking on Holden thus far - he is not the only culprit by a long shot . Kim Novak 's lines , virtually all of them , are beyond belief at times , most notably when she disses her own sex ( her expression not mine ) . Not just Novak , either - the `` Certs is a candy mint , Certs is a breath mint-like '' marriage dialog between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell is distracting at first and ultimately annoying . Russell as the desperate old maid with her last chance at marriage , at first sympathetic and somewhat compelling , becomes merely irritating . O'Connell as the confirmed bachelor cum thinly disguised dirty old man does not help matters . Additional gems are had from Novak 's younger sister and the `` young man advocate '' next door neighbor . Even Cliff Robertson , who probably gave the best performance if that term could be applied to this film , gets into the act with his `` lovemaking '' scenes with Novak . Add all of this up and you have dialog not worthy of a high school production.Finally , and perhaps most significantly is the message about women delivered in a not so subtle manner . Novak is told by her younger sister at the conclusion that just because she ( the sister ) has big plans to make a success of herself that is no reason for Novak to be a `` dope '' and do likewise - i.e. , she should go ahead and run away with the `` young man '' she just met yesterday and live happily ever after . Even for the 1950 's this is a little hard to swallow . But the best ( worst ) is saved for last . The viewer is left with Novak 's `` love conquers all '' choice to run away with the `` young man '' who a ) has no visible means of supporting himself let alone a wife and the inevitable children now or in the foreseeable future , b ) has at best an erratic personal history and probably would not be above spousal abuse . For this Novak is abandoning a man who may truly love her and is a success - not the best reason to get married either , but far better than the choice she made .	-1
I have come to the conclusion that the only reason this movie has highly rated reviews is because everyone enjoyed seeing Cybill Shepherd take her clothes off again , and again , and again ... ... The town in the film is dying - why ? because all the smart people took off and went someplace else.What is left in the town are complete idiots . The only bright spot was Ben Johnson - who was just as real and natural as ever . Even HE left - as his character died halfway in the film . I got a big news flash for Bogdanovich - girls in the 1950 's were not amoral as they are depicted in the film . They were amoral in the 1970 's ( when the picture is filmed ) . There were a lot of future stars in this film Jeff Bridges , Timothy Bottoms ( Randy Quaid was awful in this film , as usual ) - and a lot of current stars ( 70 's ) ( Ellen Burstyn , Eileen Brennan , Cloris Leachman ) who actually carry the film ... .barely . I am surprised that Cybill Shepherd was able to have any kind of career after this movie . I guess it helps when your boyfriend is the director . Good Lord , do n't waste your time watching this movie - it 's not worth it .	-1
Let me first tell you about myself before I talk about this movie . I am an active member my schoo'l drama club . I have been part of every play since my freshman year . Whether if its on stage or being part of the crew , you will always find my name somewhere in playbook . I am going to be completely honest ; I know I am not that good when it comes to acting . So when it comes to being in my school plays , I always find myself in the ensemble cast . Basically that means I am part of the back round characters . But that 's not bad , in every play where I have been in the ensemble ; I always learn to find the fun in it . I always manage to enjoy my part in the production , even if it is such a small part . And once the play is over , I always look back and realize that I had a great time . This year , my High Schools performed GODSPELL in the spring . However , this year , being my junior year , I decided it was time for me to do something bigger then ensemble . For the past 3 years , all I have been doing was ensemble or some minor backstage position . Because I KNEW that I was once again gon na land in the ensemble , and since it was the last production of the year and I was in the ensemble for the two earlier production , I decided not to be in the cast for GODSPELL . And after watching this movie , which I thought was horrible ; I said , `` I am DEFINETLY not being in the cast '' . So I decided to be crew . But enough about me let me talk about GODSPELL.Basically anybody who is reading should have a good idea about what the plot line is . It is basically Jesus in the 1960 's in New York . First there is a small twenty-some group living their daily lives in New York when all of sudden they drop their activities and join John the Baptist in water fountain where they all become baptized . Once they are baptized they meet Jesus . From there on they follow him around New York City and he teaches them passages from the Bible through various different songs an comical moments . All the songs have very catchy tunes . Personally , my favorite ones were `` We Beseech Thee '' , `` Light of the World '' , `` Bless the Lord '' , `` Save the People '' , and `` All for the Best '' ( Those songs boost this movie up to 2-stars ) . And besides teaching the audience about Bible passages , this musical also shows people the life of Jesus in which he was betrayed by one of his closest friends . That part is a major section of this play ; it takes place in the last part of it . From then on , the musical changes from lively cheery happy atmosphere into a tragedy . By the end of the musical , the audience gets a more positive look on the religion of Christianity.Now let me explain why I did not like this movie . Personally , it was because the movie was very weird , especially the characters . I know the actors had to portray the characters in their own way , but I liked the ones that my schoolmates portrayed . I though that my school did much better job of presenting this musical then the movie did . They made up characters who very likeable and while the ones in this movie were just annoying and they made up such lame humor . I remember looking at this movie all-weird during its so-called humorous moments . And I also remember me laughing at the jokes that were included in the my school 's production . By the times this movie was over , I said `` Thank God '' . But when my High school production ended , I looked back and realize that it was a great show and then TOTALLY REGRETTED that I was not in the cast . I was probably not going to be in the cast anyway even if I did not see this movie , but it still shows that my High school must have done a seriously good job performing this show if it made me feel that way . Somebody from school taped the play and I own a copy of that . I am gon na end this by saying that I would much rather watch a taping of my High School performing this musical then watching this movie .	-1
This film is manipulative and exploitative . It DOES NOT really give you a portrait of what alienation , paranoia and dislocation are really like . It glamourises these things in the worst possible way ie very , very slickly and with a lot of craft and attention to detail . This film belongs in the same dustbin as similarly AMORAL and empty films like Seven , Goodfellas et al that purport to be 'truthful ' investigations of the dark and disturbing - they are part of the problem , not the solution !	-1
As usual , I do not write my reviews to get agreement since 95 % or more of the population does NOT know what is good from bad , pearl to a swine.You know how you watch old movies and now , even when you watch them again , you still tend to rate them high due to memories of watching them when you were younger and feeling the obligation to remain faithful to how you felt ? That 's how this movie is . It 's an oldie with good acting and whatnot , but I did not enjoy it very much because of the following reasons : SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! INTENDED MAINLY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE OR PEOPLE THAT DO N'T GIVE A BLANK.In no specific order:1 . The guy gets ready and does all this training to , in the end , kill 3 or 4 low life losers , some of which were not armed and even tried not to provoke him ? The basically provoked them and acted like some sort of tough guy . The whole movie sets you up , making you sort of think that he was going after big game aka the possible presidential candidate when the whole time , after all the training he 's done ... .he took out 3 low-life 's , which by the way sucks and made the ending really disappointing . It 's like the whole plot revolves around the end where he kills those guys.2 . He goes and kills those guys and he 's declared a hero without going to jail ? Was that how it is back then ? You go out and you kill bad guys and you not only DO N'T go to jail ... .but treated as a hero ? Does n't make much sense to me , either that or times sure have changed . What he did was basically premeditated murder or mass murder.3 . The movie does n't really make clear who the main character plans to take out and the main character never seems to do much research or investigation into his mastermind scheme ... .which I really felt to be completely coincidental due to that fact . So basically that part of the plot goes like this : He talks about how he dislikes the scums and low-life 's of the city aka drug dealers , prostitution , etc etc . Then he trains with a few guns that he bought , then one day he just decides okay it 's time to do it . Then he goes and kills three criminals . Again I bring up that he does not do any research into these guys or the movie never shows him do enough research to justify his final scenes . You 're left confused till the very end and it 's not a clever setup either.4 . There was a lot of useless scenes that did not assist with the ending scene . Scenes like : a ) He fell in love with this blond , which dumped him.b ) His hatred for the geek that keeps following the blond.c ) The scenes with the other cab drivers , never really builds a relationship with them much and they do nothing to the story except make it longer.d ) Scenes of him training , did he REALLLLLLY need to train to kill 3 guys ? ? ? ? Thought he was going to take out an army or something , totally anti-climatic.e ) Most of the cab scenes , read the following below.5 . The movie , I felt , did not efficiently utilize and implicate his role as a taxi driver . Why do I feel this way ? Because whatever he did and whatever he felt and whatever he knew , could have been done , felt , or known even without being a Taxi Driver . Let 's go deeper . He drives around and notices all this crap in the street which makes him dislike the city more and wants to do something about it . You do n't need to be in a taxi to feel this way or find out about this . A better way to implicate his role as a taxi driver to further help the plot of the story would be him spying on bad guys or getting important information as a taxi driver , using his taxi driving identity to somehow sneak into certain places and acting as a spy , etc.Thinking back on that movie , the only spying he really did was probably with the presidential candidate that coincidentally got into his cab and talking to him , but even that I felt was useless . And this scene alone confuses the plot , not help clarifies anything . He knows nothing of the guy , how can he be a supporter ? So what ? He feels sorry for one prostitute and helps her get free and he 's a hero ? What the heck ? What about those other hundreds or thousands of other prostitutes ? It 's like if I went out and adopted a single cat at the pound and ran around calling myself a savior . CRAP ! ! The acting was good , but the movie , IMO , is not that great . It was probably a good oldie , but a present day analysis makes the movie not so good at all .	-1
At first veiwing , I thought this would be a dark comedy , and it starts like one : death of a long-time friend first evokes panic , then is replaced by an almost callous attitude ( as seen in the high school bathroom ) and eventually deception and betrayal follow . The bright settings and clothes are a stark contrast to their grim deed , and Rose Mcdowell plays her role wonderfully . Unfortunatley the plot soon turns ho-hum as the movie progresses , losing it 's scathing humour and becoming cliched in its & quot ; thwarting the evil ploys & quot ; of Mcdowell . Also , there were numerous plot holes in the movie , especially concerning the & quot ; crime scene & quot ; and the police ' acquiring of the suspect . I guess the only comparison to this movie would be Heathers , which far out shines this pale copy .	-1
The only justifiable and redeemable quality of this movie that is worth mentioning is that Pam Grier has a supporting role in it . Although her character was written as 2 dimentional and left no room for any depth or development , she did give an almost & quot ; oscar-worthy & quot ; performance when she slammed the jawbreaker on the table while trying to intimidate one of the girls . You go Pam ! I watched in discomfort as Pam ( who so brilliantly played & quot ; Jackie & quot ; in & quot ; Jackie Brown & quot ; ) tried to no avail to bring her lame character to life . I only saw the boredom in her eyes . The entire time i viewed this piece , i wanted to take over for the director and do this film some justice . There were so many opportunities to make this movie work but it seems as though the filmmakers had a creative blockage holding them back . A jawbreaker maybe ?	-1
Ralph Fiennes once again suffers in doomed passion - as he didin THE ENGLISH PATIENT . This time he 's thrown over for a reason thatmight have been a shocker in the fifties but comes as an unconvincing spiritual conviction at the turn of the milennium . The Cinematography was Oscar nominated as was Julianne Moore 's leading performance - neither deserved in my estimation . The film is rather leaden and tacky looking - one wonders why anyone thought it would be interesting to today 's audiences . The one overlooked gem is Stephen Rea 's supporting performance - he does a wonderful job making a bore actually appealing .	-1
FLOP ! ! THUD ! ! SMASH ! ! SPLATTER ! ! WHAT A MESS WE HAVE HERE ! ! ! look people this is the reputation of the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE on the line here , wich is the HOLY GRAIL ! ! of horror movies in my book and i know im not alone on that one.part 2 now that one was supposed to be a slapstick ! ! dummmmmmm ! ! gooooofball ! ! of a movie so you can some what enjoy it for what it is.part3 & quot ; LEATHERFACE & quot ; ONLY ! ! with the UNRATED VERSION/AND ECSPECIALY ONLY WITH THE ALTERNATE ENDING this movie then is a damn good tribute to the original , they should make a special edition with the alternate ending in the feature presentation , then it could be looked at in a whole new way ! ! another thing BAD ! ! about part3 is KEN ( super crappy actor ) FOREE 'S he played the stupid in charge machine gun spraying hero in G.ROMERO 'S DAWN OF THE DEAD and he is the main down fall in that movie , he plays the same exact stupid in charge machine gun spraying gung fu kicking IDIOT ! ! in T.C.M 3 wich makes it a downfall.and now for part 4 and or next generation this one was actually moving along pretty well i was enjoying it very much ! ! !

ITS AN INSULT ! ! ! ! ! p.s . so far the only one that truly holds a candle to the original is T.C.M.2003 i LOVED it ! ! ! it was awsome , it pays alot of respect to the original , i just baught the platnum series double disk set today and it freaken buetiful.like i said its the reputation of the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE on the line here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
i have to give credit to this T.C.M , at least you could see what was going on in this movie . although that 's the only thing this film had going for it ! the acting just was n't there , i mean i could shoot a home video with better acting then that ! and the & quot ; stunts & quot ; , where do i even begin ? all i want to know is , why the hell are we suppose to believe that hitting a teenager three times with a stupid little twig- that did n't even have enough force to knock out a mouse- was suppose to knock the teenage chick out cold ? i 'd tell you to go out and rent the original if you 're looking for a scare , but the truth is the first is n't any better !	-1
I got a chance to see most of this movie last night and boy was it terrible . What really scares me is some of the people who are giving this four or five stars and trying to make this into an artsy , high-minded movie . `` Parody '' ? ! ! Parodies are supposed to be genuinely comedic , not merely cliche-ridden . And sure there was a conspiracy thing thrown in near the end in order to make it seem more intelligent than it was , but it was still poorly executed . The `` boss man '' chiding the family for not inspiring horror into people and his spheel about `` spiritual matters '' near the end came off as ridiculous attempts at high-minded commentary with no depth whatsoever into them whatsoever . I notice the people who try to `` rationalize '' only end up making up things in order to fill out gross inconsistencies to cover up that this was just a bad movie . The pussification of Leatherface is truly saddening . He only picks up and chases people with a chainsaw twice , the rest of the time whining like a little girl . I agree with some of the other reviewers here that there was no suspenseful buildup to the entrance of the villains whatsoever . When Leatherface in this one just walks to the girl and she reacts by trying to run away with him grabbing her , I felt like if I were in that situation , I would have just push-kicked ol ' Leatherface . In the original , you felt that senes of dread when the kids found their old abandoned house and the one guy when to the house next door , went through the door , walking down the hallway , and then stumbeled to the doorway just as Leatherface stepped from the side , and the camera angle panned up just as Leatherface brought down his hammer on the poor guy 's head . Now that was terror . Here , there is made no attempt to build up that suspense . Probably because of the ... acting . This film lacks the cinematography and picture quality that made the original work so well . The only good thing about this one was the performances of Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger . Matthew was great as the head psycho and Renee exited me as the nerdy girl who finally summoned up the courage to stand up to the family , debase them , insult them , and threaten them just before the `` big boss '' came and she began to tremble down again upon realizing that the conspiracy that the lady talked about might have been true after all . It is because of them that I 'm going to give this movie two stars .	-1
At first I was no fan of the origional , but now i enjoy it a lot , and the remake is a fun time , but this.. ! ! ! What was Hollywood thinking ? This has to be the worst sequel in the series ! And most of the ones after the origional werent too great to begin with , but this is pure garbage ! Im not smacking the fans who enjoy this movie , it 's just not my cup of tea so to speak . But if some people like it , that 's good enough , this just was a huge let down for me .	-1
I truly must say is that this 4th installment of the Chainsaw Series is the most stupidst movie I ever seen out of all of the horror movies I saw.This film trys to bring back the chills from the first movie but this did n't come close.I highly recomend that you stay away from this film.The best Texas Chainsaw massacres are 1,2 and 3.This was one of the most dumbest movie ever to be released to the public.STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE ... ... OR ELSE !	-1
Resident Evil is meant to be a video game series and *not* a movie series . Simple as that . Why ? Because the movie writers made Apocalypse nothing more than a generic run of the mill zombie flick , and a rather average one at that.They bring in Nemesis , what I consider the ULTIMATE bad guy in the classic Resident Evil 3 game . While extremely dangerous and intimidating in the video game , he does nothing but plod along in a slow moving way in the movie . He 's still relatively cool I suppose , with the ability to detect those who are armed and pose a threat to him which is a fascinating feature , and of course , his trusty rocket launcher is as explosive in the movie as it is in the game ( of course it is- Hollywood can smell a perfect opportunity for special effects and the rocket launcher surely satisfies in that regard ) . However , in the game ( as Jill ) you had to REALLY move your legs as quickly as possible or you 'd get caught . He 's not fast enough in the movie so everyone can easily run away from him . Cool looking , but lacking speed . This is a vital and distinct feature that 's missing.I 'm also not particularly fond of the fact that Jill Valentine takes a back seat so the always attractive Milla Jovovich can shine in the spotlight . Throughout the film Jill basically sticks behind Milla 's character so Milla can take care of all the approaching danger . Meh , Jill deserves better in my opinion . Also , it seems strange that Raccoon City is so enormous . Do n't get me wrong , it 's a big city in the video game series so this makes total sense , it 's just that it 's hard to believe ( without spoiling the ending in both the movie *and* video game ) such a big city would be considered irrelevant when you-know-what happens at the end . Not a good storyline direction for a movie.There 's nothing remotely scary about this movie . Apocalypse is not going to appeal to Resident Evil 2 survival horror fans , that 's for sure . All kinds of adrenaline pumping shooting action aroung every corner with several Resident Evil 4-style athletic kicks and jumps is what you can expect instead . I say avoid this movie and stick with the gaming series .	-1
The chorus goes `` Have you met writer/director Paul WS Anderson ? He 's the biggest hack in the whole wide world , if there ever was a hack , he 'd be the biggest hack , he 's a big fat big fat stupid hack ! Hack hack hack hack hack hack he 's a stupid hack ! '' Well you get the idea.REA was supposed to be the film that addressed the problems of the ill fated poorly received original RE movie , and while this film is significantly better it still falls flat on its face , and completely lacks the artistic integrity of the game on which it is based.Jill Valentine , and Nemesis , and a couple others FINALLY appear in an RE movie . That 's where the good news ends , however , as the film once again forces this useless Alice character into a spotlight that belonged to Jill , Chris , Leon , and Claire . The movie forces itself into the already complex plot of RE Nemesis ( PS1 , GCN , DC , PC ) . Sadly it negates the fantastic frantic storyline of the source material and instead focuses on two moody women who would never get dates in real life because their attitudes make them completely unattractive . Jill and Alice were both written as though they were the same character , and both were played out like they would get into a serious cat fight at the drop of a hat . I did n't buy that Jill would rescue Alice at the end because I never got the impression that they were getting along . But its hard to get along with yourself , really ... these two were identical in attitude , tone ( which was just awful ) and even their posture ! Not only that , but Jill in the movie was NOT the Jill from the game . They may have put her in the same costume , gave her the same name , but the way Jill came across in the movie is completely different from her superior video game counter part.What it boils down to is this , game fans want to see the story of their favorite games brought to the big screen true to form . We never asked for Alice , we do n't want Alice , drop kick Alice ! Let 's make the next one based on the magnificent RE4 , let 's get good actors in there , and let 's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script . PWS Anderson is the biggest hack in Hollywood and people need to stop giving that guy projects . He ruins everything he touches . This one 's not even worth playing MST3K to .	-1
Another movie based on a horror video game francise . Skip it and save your money unless you are a 13 year old gamer .	-1
Resident Evil : Apocalypse is a gargantuan bomb of a movie and why do you ask is beacause it is just plain horrible . Bad writing , acting and the action set pieces are mind numbingly crappy and non exciting . This sequel takes place right after the original in the desolate town of Racoon City where the virus has spread even more and the inhabitants become zombies . Just like the first one this suffers but the first one was a notch better in my mind . Starring Mill Jovovich ( Resident Evil , The Fifth Element ) , Oded Fehr ( The Mummy and The Mummy Returns ) , Mike Epps ( Next Friday , Friday After Next ) , Jared Harris ( I Shot Andy Warhol , Igby Goes Down ) and Alan Tudyk ( 28 Days , Tv 's Firefly ) . I hated everything about this movie and the Nemesis creature was laugh out loud funny . This bored the hell out of me . I got ta say this goes down the line for being so retarded like Van Helsing was . The chick who played Jill Valentine and the others sprouted some awful dialouge . `` im good but not that good '' please . For die hard fans of Resident Evil but beware , these people dont know how to make a good movie if it bit them in the ass . I do n't really care what other 's say..hey , at least I got some taste . This movie is for no-brainers .	-1
The first time I watched this movie I found it very difficult to understand . I could n't follow the plot at all ... then I realized that I had rented the Japanese version featuring the talented Shigeru Tsuyuguchi as the narrator.After some research , I discovered that an American version of this movie was available with narration by the late , great Dudley Moore.While Dudley Moore 's narration is charming and informative , I found the movie to be terribly misleading . Cats and dogs do not like each other - never have , never will . When the adorable dog ( Otis ) and the mischievous kitty ( Milo ) are separated after their day of carefree , reckless abandon , the two `` friends '' are sent on reluctant , yet incredible journey to find each other.A cat in search of a lost dog ? A dog in search of a lost cat ? Forgive me while I scoff in disbelief.It 's movies like `` The Adventures of Milo and Otis '' that give children ideas about how to rebel against society . Milo tells us that it 's okay to jump on a raft and get swept down a set of treacherous rapids . Otis tells us that it 's okay to confront ferocious grizzly bears , and that a cute little wag of the tail will make everything alright . The creators of this movie should be ashamed of themselves ... teaching children lessons like this.Getting lost in the wilderness is not a `` fun adventure '' , it 's often a terrifying and lonely experience.I expected a little more common sense from a children 's movie ...	-1
This is one movie I remember from my childhood and I 'm sure that there 's other ASNers that remember this movie quite well . For those who have n't seen this movie it 's about a cat and dog , but it 's just all animals and no people featured in the movie , it 's only narrated throughout the movie . Watching it now , it seems like it has n't aged that well to me anyways and I do n't mean that it 's still a good kids or family movie whichever you want to label this movie as . Not only that but it 's a little short at least I think it is in some way . Overall I give The Adventures of Milo & Otis 2 stars out of 5 .	-1
A lot of people on Amazon have been saying & quot ; Go & quot ; is some kind of Gen-X & quot ; Pulp Fiction & quot ; , but that 's being kind to the movie . Sure , there are three loosely related plot threads that happen simultaneously , but the dialogue is just okay and the characters are not that developed or interesting . Still , the movie does have a few startling plot twists and benefits from some charismatic acting ; Taye Diggs and Timothy Olyphant stood out in my mind , although just about everyone was good ( except Katie Holmes ' character failed to make an impression , but maybe that 's just because she paled in comparison when everyone else in the movie was over-the-top horny , stupid , desperate , and/or malevolent ) .Best thing I liked about the movie was its portrayal of today 's youth as a bunch of underachieving dummies . ( I 'm only 29 , but I can still feel smug and superior ... & quot ; Back in my day & quot ; ... ) One character apparently waits until the day before she 's to be evicted to scrape up rent money ; lots of kids pop pills not knowing what 's in them ; the best scene has a strip-club bouncer who 's just been shot being simultaneously stitched up and chewed out by his dad , who tells him that the only reason people get to & quot ; the top & quot ; these days is by screwing up so badly , the people above them ca n't do their jobs . ( An even longer and more bitter version of this scene appears among the DVD deleted scenes . ) I watched some of the director 's commentary too , and was interested to find out that neither the director nor the editor had ever taken ecstasy , although they try to portray the feeling with lots of cuts and distortion and rave footage . It does create a very disorienting landscape in those scenes , and they say that people who know what it 's like tell them they got the chaotic feeling right-on.Overall , the movie is not at all substantial , but it is slightly edgy ( thanks to Olyphant 's deadpan drug dealer ) , a little bit funny , occasionally surprising , and it moves quickly enough to keep from getting boring .	-1
Elizabeth Mastrantonio , the star of the good & quot ; COLOUR OF MONEY & quot ; , accepted to play the role of a aging singer who sings only in night clubs and pubs . Since the start , we can see the script is a total mess . The songs she sings are plain horrible , but this is only a detail in a completely ridiculous production , that has inocuous characters , bad acting , bad direction , bad screenplay and a disgusting ending .	-1
Terrible picture . Bad acting ( Mastrantonio singing is something unbeliavable , so bad it is ) , slow direction , no climax , absurd ending ( or lack of it ! ) . An indulgent film all the way , you sense the director is sure he is doing a masterpiece with low budget , but he is not ! Strathairn saves himself , the rest is bad , man , really bad .	-1
This movie had one of the most inrteresting beginnings i 've ever seen , it gets you into the movie right away . After that though the movie 's photogtaphy is annoying and the movie just gets stupid . The ending is depressing and i 'd just like to say that who ever wrote this movie is a disturbed person with a disgusting outook on life . If you are n't all there and you like a truly depressing movie that would hurt a normal person 's head then this is the movie that you 've been searching for .	-1
Somehow this film just does n't work . Jeff Bridges goes over the top and becomes irritating . The plot is laughably ridiculous . But on the other hand , the film has a cool blockbuster ending that it deserves kudos for alone . I liked the film 's premise , it just does n't come off . I think Bridges and Robbins were sorely miscast .	-1
I did n't like the way the story went . A little depressing for me . If I had known the subject I would n't have got it .	-1
Horrible . Absolutely horrible in characters , story and atmospherics.Jeff Bridges ' character is so inconsistent and contradictory that he is not only unbelievable , but grating . The story fails in every way possible . The bad guy 's plan depends not only upon being able to predict ( not just manipulate ) actions of multiple characters , but to intricately synchronize them , even when they have only indirect access . Even worse , their plan depends upon Bridges ' character making critical inferences on a precise schedule . But the cardinal sin is that script has as a key element of the bad guys ' plan an ultra-sophisticated attempt to negate/disrupt another key element of that plan , that is , that Bridges ' character by a stroke of luck/coincidence combined with a flash of brilliance will thwart the bad guys ' effort to sabotage their own plan.Pacing and other atmospherics can overcome substantial flaws in the script , but in this movie , they are so amateurish that they emphasize and exacerbate those problems .	-1
This is one of those movies in which everything seems to be in place ... and yet it still just falls flat.The acting is good , Bridges giving the strongest performance , though it 's always a pleasure to see Joan Cusack in ANYTHING . The script is good , the direction is good ... but the movie as a whole left me empty and a little irritated.It 's unclear what this film would like to do , aside from entertain . Should we walk out feeling that terrorists are much more complex than they seem ? Should we walk out feeling unsafe and suspecting everyone ? There are scenes in this movie where Jeff Bridges is teaching a class in terrorism , and he talks about how illusory our feeling of safety is ... and that 's fine , but I wanted one of the students to ask `` So what do you want us to do ? Be afraid ? Worry ? Never leave the house ? What ? '' In that way the movie seems to want to just stir up a lot of fear without giving it any direction or offering any possible solution . Of course there IS N'T a solution , but I feel that this movie stirs up a lot of fear and paranoia just to draw the audience into some excitement , and then makes the audience feel bad for being excited by such a thing . I felt manipulated and annoyed after it ended.I also think this entire subject is a little too sensitive to be trying to milk entertainment dollars out of . If you want to make a serious drama , go ahead , but do n't try to both draw us in with the promise of `` spooky terrorist thrills '' and then want to have a serious look at the issue . I was also a little bit uncomfortable with the sheer number of children-in-extreme-peril scenes . Again , if you want to treat this subject seriously , go ahead , but do n't invite us to be `` thrilled '' by it.I will say that the cinematography [ by Bobby Bukowski ] in this film was amazing . It makes SUCH a difference simply to have some visually interesting compositions up on the screen for once , instead of having movies that have all the compositional thought of snapshots . It just gives you something to LOOK at . My favorite scenes were the one with the RED phones against the grey sky , and the fence with the grey roofs above it . Amazing ! Kudos to you , guys ! This was literally my favorite part of the movie.As for the `` surprise '' ending -- Woo Hoo , Big Deal.I have come to like this movie less and less since I saw it [ and that was pre-9/11 ] . This is one I would say you could skip completely , not even wait for the video . Just skip it . It leaves you with nothing but a bad taste in your mouth .	-1
When our son was about 7 , he received this movie as a gift , and watched it pretty frequently . The other day it occurred to me , as the now 10-year-old boy was watching some movie , that he had n't pulled `` Hook '' out of its case in about 2 years or so . I was finally able to put a finger on what had always annoyed me about this movie -- - it is the sort of movie that an 8-year-old would produce , given an appropriate budget.The sets are pretty spectacular , but seem to be an end in and of themselves . The presentation is simply relentless , and seems more focused on launching an all-out assault on the senses of the hapless movie viewer . Lost in all the hubbub & spectacle is a coherent plot . Apparently , the surface details are more important than a storyline , decent performances , etc . I doubt our son will be watching this anymore , and for this I am grateful .	-1
My son is obsessed with the Disney cartoon of Peter Pan , so it was natural that he would want to see this . One of my joys with my kids is revisiting things that I loved at their age as well as discovering new things . Unfortunately , though the incomparable Spielberg was involved , this film is wholly lacking in that indefinable magic that makes for greatness . I found the whole thing flat , the acting poor to fair even with Robin Williams , and the attempt to add on to an wholly contained work of art a dimsal failure . You should n't try to make a knockoff of something that stands perfectly on its own . This is the worst that I ever saw in a Spielberg film . The only things going for it are special effects and rollicking violence.Not recommended .	-1
I should have read the bad reviews before watching this over-long , misadventure in film-making . I have to agree with ALL the one-star reviews here . I am glad I saw this mess on TV before buying the DVD . It is highly offensive to anyone not saturated in liberalism with perverted views of religion and art . This crap is pointless , obtuse , and degrading to the kind of people who live in Montana , none of whom appear in this movie .	-1
I was looking at the main title sequence of this film , and maybe it was the DVD release , but why was Elmer Bernstein credited as doing the music , when even the back of the box says that Mark Isham did the music ? When I saw the film on VHS , they had the correct information , but why was the DVD incorrect ? Are other releases of this film on DVD providing the same incorrect information , or actually listing Isham as the composer . What made the issue even more ridiculous is how the end credits had Isham 's regular orchestrator and conductor , Ken Kugler , and Bernstein always conducted his own scores by this time period . Please , will anyone explain this discrepancy ? On the whole though , bad film , but beautiful cinematography . However , Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn were extraordinary .	-1
I really like Bobcat Goldthwait , but am forced to conclude that despite some funny sequences in 'Shakes ' , he is a vastly more talented standup comedian ( his latest CD is wonderful ) than film star/director . I think that the concept behind 'Shakes ' is very funny , and the film had much greater potential than it ultimately realized as a satire of the dregs of society that clowns largely are . Actually watching the film though is occasionally funny , often painful.The guest spots , particularly the Florence Henderson role , were brilliant , and some of the interpersonal encounters between Shakes and others are very entertaining ; for example , when Shakes is late for the children 's party near the beginning of the film , and has a few words with the father that booked the event . Overall , though , especially in the clown bar , the dialogue is just not funny , and the characters other than Shakes ( especially the execrable Adam Sandler ) are just so annoying that not only do we not care about them , we dislike them intensely , and worse , just do n't care what happens to them.The concept plus a few occasional strokes of genius are worth two stars , but it could have been so much better with a true comic genius like Bobcat at the helm . As a footnote , I HIGHLY recommend Bobcat 's newest CD , & quot ; I Do n't Mean To Insult You , But You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait. & quot ; It has a hysterical account of the movie , and a debate he had on the 'Today ' show with Bamboozle the ( real ) clown which is a true gem of standup comedy , and far better than this movie itself . Recommended only to diehard Bobcat completists .	-1
An unusual movie , but ultimately an embarassing failure . Beautiful cinematography and costuming can not rescue this false , bloated , at times ridiculous , reprise of the story of Jeanne d'Arc . The problems can be stated precisely : 1 ) Luc Besson . 2 ) Milla Jovovich.Besson 's Jeanne is a bellowing lunatic and latter day feminist with a wicked right cross . She lounges in bed until midday then furiously berates her commanders for starting the battle without her . Similarly , her knights can be found sleeping late ( in full armour ! ) on the battlefield with the English Army directly to their front . The English in their turn are mercilessly pilloried as a race of brutal proto nazis , well ... OK . These are just a few of the film 's more besetting problems . Besson 's Jeanne comes across as not a maid , but a madwoman worthy of institutionalization , if not the stake.Likewise , Milla Jovovich 's Jeanne is an insult to her memory . Alternately screaming , squeaking , pouting and hallucinating ... It is difficult to imagine teenage boys following such a girl around a swimming pool , let alone hardened campaigners following her into battle . One finds one 's self looking forward to her execution.Jeanne 's story deserves much better treatment than she gets in this deplorable film .	-1
This is quite possibly one of the worst films ever conceived . Not just made , but conceived . Milla Jovovich ca n't act her way out of a wet paper bag . I thought The Fifth Element illustrated that . The following people wasted their time and talent on this project : Dustin Hoffman , John Malcovich , Tch & eacute ; ky Karyo , Faye Dunaway . The insane in your face cinematography and the disturbing screaming and gestures of Jovovich 's are just awful . Why does Bravo : The Film and Arts Network include this in their 5-Star Cinema series ? It 's fertilizer .	-1
It seems that Luc Besson is capable of reaching deep inside of this Milla Jojovich and bringing out a beautiful monster . Her portrayal of one of the least understood of our most famous icons is intense , and thoughtful - bringing the viewer full circle around the character of Joan of Arc.Unfortunately , Jojovich is the the only relief from what is a long and generously violent flick . There are a number of & quot ; spirtual & quot ; moments in the film which deal with her supposed communication with God . However , it is apparent that Besson has his predetermined notions as to whether Joan of Arc was indeed divine or disturbed and we are never really given the opportunity to consider the other.Unfortunately for Besson , this is the first movie to involve knights , castles , and battles since Braveheart ( Gibson , 1995 ) which seems to have become the obvious comparison . Even the & quot ; revenge & quot ; story is not dissimilar enough from the Braveheart & quot ; righteous revenge & quot ; theme to encourage excitement about The Messenger.Even an & quot ; Obi-Wan Kenobi & quot ; style performance from Dustin Hoffman does not detract from the fact that by the time you have sat through The Messenger , you will really feel that you have seen it all before .	-1
The Messenger : The Story of Joan of Arc ( Luc Besson , 1999 ) As the final credits rolled , I found myself asking one thing many times : what in the world was ( fill in the actor , director , etc . ) thinking ? Besson , who gave us such amusing and occasionally brilliant fare as Leon and Nikita , went way off the deep end . Milla Jovovich , who worked so well with Besson in The Fifth Element , delivers every line as if she 's being forced to overact . John Malkovich is about as French as a quesadilla . Etc . One wonders why this got a big-screen release and Christian Duguay 's incredibly superior three-hour Joan of Arc , release the same year , got relegated to TV miniseries status.Mother always said that if you ca n't say anything good , then shut up . So I 'll just say that if you 're looking for a modern retelling of the tale of St. Joan , Duguay 's version is available on DVD . Rent it . Forget this exists . * ( only because Dustin Hoffman actually gives a halfway decent performance ; too bad he 's only got about ten minutes of screen time . )	-1
I bought this in the vague hope of stumbling on one more underpublicized and underappreciated ( in the US ) French masterpiece such as Claude Berri 's Queen Margot . Not quite ! There are certainly aspects of brilliance here both in the cinematography and Mila Jovovich 's performance , but there is a tremendous amount of anarchy and occasional apparent aimlessness in the plot . Of course the Joan of Arc story is well known , but many times , the director seemed to let things ramble on without good tie ins . It 's a long film , but that should n't be a vice . Here it is , because long portions could be cut without harming the overall effect . Better yet , the themes could have been better established and linked and the character development focused better . Apart from the title character , everyone else was pretty much constructed of cardboard.What really offended me about The Messenger was the dialogue , which in many places is simply ludicrous . There is plenty of 90 's colloquialism and plenty of medieval cliche , but very little authentic sounding conversation reflecting the status relationships between French nobility ( and royalty ) and peasants . At the same time , there are some cheap , Keystone coppish antics in which the ostensible army leaders bumble like the Three Stooges , while Joan takes some implausible action . In these respects , at least , The Messenger demonstrates that the Hollywood lowest common denominator can be at home on the Continent as well . This sort of triviality really disappoints me , as I think it did a lot to mediocratize another film which should have been very good , Mel Gibson 's Patriot . All in all , what is frustrating is that this could also have been a very worthy effort , perhaps memorable , but fails because the whole was far less than the sum of the parts .	-1
Not only is Joan of Arc presented as a nut in this film , she 's clearly tripping on speed : Jumping out of her skin , screaming her head off and delivering banal lines with halting , eye-bugging intensity.It 's hard to believe that even the most religiously medieval French soldier would give this loon the time of day , let alone follow her into battle.Mon Dieu ! Run awaaaaaayy . . .But I 'll say this for the director , he 's consistent . It 's fast paced all the way through , what with boulders a la 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom ' getting hurled at the troops along with other JamesBondian gizmos making for cool technogore.Which , alongside Joan 's motivation in this script ( Her sister 's been raped by the posse of -- er I mean the Brits ) turns it all into an enjoyable comic book Western revengefest . It 's 'The Quick and the Dead ' minus gunslingers , set in 1429 . Plus the scenes of her schizoid 'visions ' are gorgeously photographed.But as far as the real Joan of Arc , the only major historical figure whose life and thought has come down to us through sworn court testimony -- -Oh well , in the first place she 's had writers of genius like Shaw and Twain to balance this dramatization , and in the second place , as long as we 're making films about protagonists who hear voices , wild battle scenes and trials for heresy it could have been much worse.How about : `` Socrates , Herald of Hades ! `` ( sigh )	-1
That is , a fascinating premise that , while well-acted , manages to fall nearly completely apart because nothing is connected in a way that 's necessary to keep the film coherent . It 's almost series of vignettes , each weirder than the other , and each making less sense in the `` big '' story . As a result , it may be somewhat artistic in spots , but spotty as a film . You have to work for it to hold your interest .	-1
we love elmo and oscar , but there was just something wrong wtih the pace of this story . we turned it off because it was making up all feel anxious	-1
My friend and I rented this movie at the last minute , hoping for something different . Well , it is n't different . A chick in love with two guys ... wow , how original . I did n't care at all about the characters or the lame story . It is watchable and somewhat amusing , but that 's about it .	-1
I ca n't say I liked _The Red Dwarf_ . That 's not to say I strongly disliked it , either . I simply ca n't go so far as to say I actually enjoyed the film . To me , there was no plot and no real storytelling . As such , the film is mostly just ... well , benign.I can usually only engage with a film when it is telling me an interesting ( usually complex ) story . _The Red Dwarf_ , a novelty concept piece at best , is really only a parable constructed from a single , rather obvious , theme repeated over and over again.Parables generally show less interest in the storytelling and more in the analogy they draw between a particular instance of human behavior and human behaviour at large . The simple narrative surface of this film gives it a mysterious film noir tone , but in the end it 's all just mood and does very little to paint a clear picture of the main character , Lucien L'Hotte._The Red Dwarf_ seems much more intent on teaching spiritual values than telling a good story . By the end of the film I knew of only one aspect of Lucien 's personality -- Monsieur L'Hotte was a big man trapped in a little man 's body . I would have liked to have known more.In the case of _The Red Dwarf_ , the analogy most obviously drawn upon for the progression of the screenplay is the notion explored in _I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings_ . That & quot ; caged bird & quot ; theme resounds throughout _The Red Dwarf_.With L'Hotte , it seems obvious that he feels isolated from freely enjoying the world around him because at work and in love he is made to feel inferior to & quot ; normal & quot ; people who constantly foist their prejudices upon him.I first saw the & quot ; caged bird & quot ; motif being played out with L'Hotte at the home of a fat , aging countess ( played by the fat , aging Anita Ekberg ) . L'Hotte meets the countess for the first time outside her home by the pool . The little & quot ; bird , & quot ; excuses himself to go to the bathroom . While inside the countess ' home , he takes a frenzied & quot ; bird bath & quot ; in her huge tub , dries off while gazing at the & quot ; prison & quot ; of his own encroaching body in the mirror and then goes back out to stand naked before Ekberg . Lovemaking ensues between the two with the countess ' cat watching the & quot ; little bird & quot ; flitting all over her massive petowner.Next , there is a scene where L'Hotte is in a cab and begins whistling a bird song to himself . The driver , a black man , looks into the rearview mirror and the two of them begin chuckling in a shared complicity or understanding of what it is to be & quot ; caged & quot ; -- L'Hotte in his body , the black man in his.L'Hotte befriends Isis , a young girl who travels with and performs in her & quot ; father 's & quot ; circus . Her mother died years before in a trapeze accident , so her father forbids her to perform on the trapeze even though her dream , after meeting little Mr. L'Hotte , is to do a trapeze act that incorporates his clowning . Images of Isis on the trapeze -- her & quot ; perch & quot ; -- serve to depict her in her own & quot ; cage , & quot ; unable to fly through the air because of her father 's strict edict.And , if you had any questions about that & quot ; caged bird & quot ; theme , there 's another scene toward the end of the film when L'Hotte takes the matter of his little friend , Isis , and his own future into his own hands by laying down the law to Isis ' & quot ; father. & quot ; As he finishes threatening the man , he proceeds to release a bunch of the circus ' birds from their cages , symbolically freeing himself and the little girl who has shared his experience of being & quot ; caged. & quot ; And so on and so on.Sadly , _The Red Dwarf_ is one-trick pony . And that pony ride gets old fast .	-1
The older I get , the more affection I have for Hollywood 's & quot ; golden age. & quot ; However , in this case , I 'll make an exception . Over the years , I 've come to find spinach and brussels sprouts not too bad . But folks , these guys just are not funny ! Not only does every scrap of set dressing and costuming look bargain-basement , but the labored schtick the protagonists go through over and over lacks all wit or imagination . It must have been torture for all concerned to grind out these preposterous exercises day in and day out . And remember , during shooting and before the sound editor 's ministrations , there were no juicy bonks , smacks , doinks , rips , and sproings to punctuate and enliven the goings on .	-1
Highlights : Not nearly as offensive as it could 've been . Decent performances from the actors with some notable exceptions . Some amusing dialog . Salma Hayek and Alan Rickman give great performances , especially considering some of the lines they had to read . The scene on the train is , indeed , amusing.Lowlights : Not nearly as offensive as it could 've been . Decent performances ruined by poor staging ( any seen where Linda Fiorentino is having a conversation ) . Some really lame gags . Too much Jay and Silent Bob -- small doses.The director seems better at character/dialogue driven movies . Plot-driven stories like Mallrats and Dogma seemed rushed ; in this case , too much dialog is given over to explication . I will give him credit though : he managed to get Ben Affleck to wipe that annoying smirk off his face on the train scene .	-1
This movie just is n't funny . Technically it is a comedy , however it does not deserve to be classified as such . Just as reality tv is called reality tv , that does n't make it real , in fact it is fake . George Carlin and Chris Rock were good but they could n't hold this one up as atlas held up the world . For one thing , George Carlin had a small cameo in the beginning , but if he were in the entire movie it would have been much better . George Carlin also had a small appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back , by you guessed it , Kevin Smith . George Carlin also had a small cameo appearance in Scary Movie 3 which is very funny by the way , and not made by Kevin Smith . The only Kevin Smith flicks worth watching are Jay and Silent Bob and Clerks . Stay away from Dogma and Chasing Amy , actually douse them with gasoline and light them on fire if you get the chance . Then urinate the fire out , and do it again . I 've done that before , it can really lift your spirits and make you feel better after seeing a lousy movie .	-1
This is one of the worst movies ever . I 'll say it , flat out , right there . Poor acting , poor script , poor characters , Matt Damon . It had all the elements for a terrible film.The worst part about it all is this is by Kevin Smith , the man who wrote , directed , and starred in 3 of my favorite movies ever , clerks , mallrats , and chasing amy.for those of you who thought mallrats was dumb , you 're about to see a new low . demons made of excrement , stripper angels , and hockey demons.not to mention this has some of the poorest and dumbest acting ( matt damon , i blame IT ALL on ben 's dumb buddy ) and worst cameos on film to date.the only good acting is by jason lee who tries his very hardest to pull of a roll of a character similar to the devil , but it just does n't work with the surroundings , he 's too good and everyone else is too subpar.all in all you have an overblown piece of hollywood crap . this was supposed to be a thought provoking movie that was blasphemous and sacriligious with a message , instead it was just alanis morrisette as god.the dialogues are dumb ( blame chris rock trying to do his own thing and matt damon for being matt damon ) . the characters are whiny and annoying . the movie is out of smith 's style , and it 's just more big budget hollywood stuff , the type of movie he was going to avoid.do not buy the special edition dvd , do not buy the dvd , do not buy the VHS , do not even download the DIVX , i am serious , if you are a smith fan who has yet to see this you are in for the disappointment of your life . 3 years for a new movie and this is what we got , oh well , look for jay and silent bob strikes back this fall.and for an alternative buy smith 's previous 3 movies and the clerks cartoon , it 's better than this overrated garbage	-1
I 've always been a fan of Smith 's movies . I was looking forward to seeing Dogma , especially curious around all the controversy . I wish I could say I was offended , but instead , I just did n't get it nor think it was funny . It was just one run on sentace of a joke that I never got to begin with . Maybe it 's because I did n't grow up with the Jesus religion , and instead grew up with the old testament and torah . My catholic friend 's who disliked Catholic school liked it , but again , I felt it was their inside joke that I was on the outside of . I look forward to seeing the next one Kevin . thank you .	-1
Sorry . I 'm just a stupid person , and unfortunately I coudl not see the so-called & quot ; greatness & quot ; of this & quot ; Movie & quot ; . It does n't offends Catolhics at all , it doens't offend Protestants at all ... It only offends the intelligence of the public , forced to watch the horrible duo of Affleck and Damon performing the worst characters of their movie carrer , and forced to watch a ridiculous blonde guy using bad language all movie long , and forced to watch the unshameful commercial appearance by Alanis Morrissete , as a totally unconvincing God . For a person to think this garbage is & quot ; polemic & quot ; , he really must have his head closed to daily life ...	-1
This film assumes to be satricial and comedic . However , the inaccuracies in the relating of history and theological doctrine overwhelm any statement or humor this movie attempts to portray .	-1
What an achievement , for Mr. Smith to recruit a dozen or so top celebrities to recite bits and pieces of his personal religious beliefs to a captive audience . Truly unbelievable . My guess is that most religious and non-religious viewers will find something to their distaste in this film ( the appearance of the `` fecal Golgothan '' was particularly unpleasant to sit through ) . In addition to the unconvincing and gruesome special effects ( Ben Affleck 's head gets blown off ! ) , Mr. Smith 's eclectic philosophy is not terribly original , taking bits of Catholic mythology and peppering them with obscure Fundamentalist rants ( i.e. , the Virgin Mary has other children by Joseph , the `` morning star '' of Isaiah is a reference to Satan ) . Meanwhile , the bloodier side of Christianity is laid bare as we hear that Damon and Affleck 's characters have been on earth `` since the time of the plagues '' , and watch these two angels `` smite '' a boardroom full of entertainment execs who operate a company named after the `` golden calf '' .Go out and watch `` Clerks '' and forget about this nonsense from an amateur theologian . Smith is a better authority on `` snowballing '' than on transubstantiation . Stick with what you know ... .	-1
I must say we purchased this because someone had told us it was & # 34 ; humorous & # 34 ; ... and we are by far not prudish ... but the constant use of foul language just within the first 15 minutes had us turn it off and give the thing away . Sometimes a & # 34 ; good swear & # 34 ; is needed when the situation calls for it , but gratuitous cursing and foul language to fill in a lack-luster script does not a good movie make .	-1
While the title Jill the reaper will entice or even shock you the truth is the opposite Dolph Lundgren plays a cop trying to stop a serial killer a female serial killer . The main actor does okay on playing a cop but the story itself can not be saved and truly it needed some rewriting .	-1
I felt I was missing something thoughout this whole movie . I have n't run across anyone who does n't regard it as a classic or a masterpiece that tugs at their heart strings ... but I just did n't feel it.It feels too much like a movie ... too much drama , too much music , and too many colorful costumes . I know it 's a movie , but when I watch movies I usually am not thinking : `` movie , movie movie '' throughout the whole thing.Not one of my favorites . I like the book this is loosely based on better .	-1
One star for Winona Ryder , one star for Susan Sarandon , one star for Claire Danes ; subtract one for Gillian Armstrong.Gillian Armstrong has directed brilliant films before , and not just by title , so my expectations for this film were quite high , and I was sorely disappointed . What was this film about ? These women love each other ? Well , we knew that after the first four minutes , and left after was pretty sets , period costumes , and an oscar quality score.It 's all very nice and wrapped in a pretty bow , but Jo 's speeches about feminism and women 's place in the world seem like frayed edges someone forget to trim.I ca n't help wondering whether in the early production stage , an associate remembered the cheering crowd at Cannes in 1979 , after the unexpected film My Brilliant Career , and thought & quot ; Jo March is an American Sybylla Melvyn , & quot ; then convinced the team to hire the director of My Brilliant Career to come to America and make Jo March 's Brilliant Career.The parallels are really there ; they are not imagined : the seemingly obvious and perfect marriage turned down . The autobiographical manuscript bundled and mailed with those small feminine hands . To defy or not to defy ; to be born homely and clever ... the actress who seems striking by our standards , but homely by the standards of the time of the film.And the undeniable talent of the starring actress . Winona Ryder has more than proved herself in the market , and among the critics.I have no idea why it did n't work . I ca n't help thinking that most of the blame rests squarely on the head of Gillian Armstrong , who seems to sleepwalk her way through the film . This picture has no stamp of art on it . The actresses are all working very hard , and in many cases rise so high above a merely adequate script , that it is too bad there is not a special Academy Award for this.It is unfortunate , but with so much potential , so much material to work with , the binding thread in this picture ends up being the pretty sets , and the well-designed period costumes . It is as though there is no director at all , but the actors memorized their lines at home in their bedrooms , came to the set , dressed , and made up the rest as the cameras rolled.Read the book instead .	-1
With a cast that includes Bette Midler , Danny DeVito , Jamie Lee Curtis and Will Ferrell , not to mention Casey Affleck and Neve Campbell , you 'd kind of expect this movie to be good , or at least funny.It 's not.In fact , ` Drowning Mona ' is far from either of those things . It is confusing , annoying , obnoxious , boring , forgettable and insulting . I 've never gotten up so many times during a movie to leave a room , hoping I 'd find something else to occupy my time . I just ca n't really think of a single redeeming factor here . It appears , from the reviews on this site , that you either love this movie or you absolutely hate it . I hate it . It is possibly the worst of the decade ( although I am still convinced that honor goes to ` Blood Diamond ' ) .And this is sad , because I adore most of the actors involved in this film.The film is told in a hodgepodge of flashbacks as Mona 's death is investigated by Chief Wyatt Rash . The film opens with Mona dying in a car accident . The town is pretty happy about this , but Rash sets out to solve her death ( or murder ) .I do n't even really want to bother.I 'd stay away from this one . It falls flat in nearly every area in my opinion , but others seem to love this so what do I know . Personally , if you like the cast I recommend checking out some of their ` better ' work , like ` Is n't She Great ' , ` Throw Mamma From The Train ' , ` True Lies ' , ` Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby ' , ` ... Jesse James ... ' and ` Wild Things ' .	-1
My title says it all.Horrible acting , confusing flashbacks , unlikely ending , lowclass content , boring , painful , annoying , miserable , dreadful ... Have I made my point ?	-1
To call this movie an abomination would be too generous ! If Trashley Dudd had tied me down and defecated in my face , she could n't have inflicted on me anything worse than this cinematic atrocity .	-1
This is so NOT fetch ! The main character is Joanna Eris , and the movie seems to want us to like her . But I could never like her even if she were the coolest girl in my school . You have no idea how mean she is . She 's a serial killer ! She stabs people . The movie wants to make her a hero , because like for Christmas one time her daddy disappeared . If my daddy disappeared on Christmas , I would totally think he must have been murdered or something . But Joanna expects us to like her killing people because her daddy disappeared on Christmas . There 's even this totally silly dude called `` the eye '' , some James Bond wannabee gone bonkers or something like that , who goes around protecting Joanna like he was just totally in love with her or something and helping her totally get away from police . Why should Joanna Eris get to stomp around like a giant , while the rest of us try not to get stabbed by her big knife ? What 's so special about Joanna that she should be seen as innocent in all this just because her daddy died on Christmas ? Her victims are just as cute as Joanna ! Her victims are totally just as smart as Joanna ! And when did it become okay for one person to be the executioner of everybody ? Because that is SO not what America is all about ! The `` eye '' should totally just stab Joanna !	-1
I JUST finished watching this one . I knew how it HAD to end . Too predictable . About half way into the movie I became grateful that I had earned it as a free rental . Not worth the renting price , in my opinion.No great effects for those with DVD players either .	-1
I wo n't go into the ending on the off chance that somebody reading this review has n't actually seen the movie yet ( and will actually want to see it after seeing all the bad reviews it 's got ) . However , the characterization is a mess , the motivations are hidden , the direction is cruel in the amounts it cuts from the storyline . Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor both give absolutely great performances ( you can almost hear Judd pleading behind the scenes with the director , & quot ; Ca n't I give it a little nuance , a smidgen of depth ? Please ? No ? Okay ... & quot ; ) . McGregor is one of my favorites and deserves major kudos for doing such a great job with a thankless script . Still , all their hard work does n't even *begin* to redeem the time I lost watching this ridiculous film . ( And , like many other people , I read the book after watching the film . Do n't even try -- you 'll feel ripped off all over again . )	-1
I just happened to notice that *The Eye of the Beholder* is the first movie I 've reviewed that was released in 2000 . We can only go up from here.Well , the movie 's about a guy who works for some sort of British Secret Service thingy ( it 's never made clear what Agency it is , only that the Agency is inordinately fond of teleconferencing , which , considering the legions of clever hackers out there , is probably an unwise predilection ) . The guy stumbles across a really hot serial killer . . . or is she ? I mean , later in the film , we 're encouraged to forget all those stabbings in favor of developing a concern for her abused psyche . Imagine Hannibal Lecter dropped into *The Prince of Tides* , and you 'll get the ( preposterous ) idea . Back to the Ewan McGregor character : he wears a big red parka and points a shotgun ( which is really a camera . Why ? ) out the window at his lovely moll , in an clear effort to be inconspicuous . Ashley Judd , in the first half , at least has the pleasant diversions of playing Dress-Up with designer clothes and fun wigs ( even though she 's supposed to be on the lam ) . Unfortunately for her , though , she winds up as a waitress in a coffee shop in . . . Alaska ! ( Why ? ) Along the way , the screenwriters muck up the & quot ; Elektra complex & quot ; and other suchlike Freudianisms . At one point , the Beholder and the Beholdee have a conversation during which the former says , & quot ; You 're a person who lost her father ; and I 'm a man who lost his daughter. & quot ; ( all together now ) Ewwww ! In summation : the filmmakers mistook incomprehensibility for entertainment . Please try again . Or , rather , do n't .	-1
You 'll find yourself asking this when this movie unexpectedly just `` ends '' . I 'm no movie cynic and I can usually find something to like in even the worst of films , but this one had the poorest , most bewildering ending I 've ever seen . It made absolutely NO sense .	-1
To compare this to other musicals like Singing in the Rain really makes this pathetic.Albert Finney is horrible . He seemed to hate acting in the movie almost as much as I hated watching him act in it.The performances were so stiff .	-1
A friend lent this to me - after seeing a bit of it , I just skimmed through the rest to see the action sequences . I agree with all of the one star reviews . Bad acting , lame comedy , and even the explosions start to become boring . Crap all the way . Does n't deserve even one star . Minus 100 stars , I 'd say .	-1
Hard to believe the reviews praising this worthless rag . For me , the jokes arent funny save one or two , the story is incredibly stupid , and unbelievable , the acting is phoned in ( Will Smith , shame on you.Your better than this ) , and most of all the editing sucks.Other than that I guess its a great movie.Bay turned in great works with `` Armageddon '' , and `` Pearl Harbor '' , but this one is a real stinker .	-1
Absolutely great movie , and the extras are terrific . However , any enjoyment of watching Criterion 's edition is spoiled by a vertical line that appears through about half the movie - including the sinking of the Titanic ( oops - did n't mean to spoil the ending ) .The line is obviously digital in nature , and not an unavoidable problem with the original print . Even if it was the print , I 've seen what Criterion can do to restore a poor print and provide the best quality version of the film possible . What is the world coming to when a person ca n't trust Criterion to deliver a quality product ? I sent the DVD back to Amazon , who kindly sent me a replacement . I even tried it on numerous DVD players , but the problem persists . It is NOT user error.I emailed the elusive folks at Criterion about a month ago , and they have not even acknowledged my complaint.This is the sort of movie - like all really great movies - that draws you in and makes you feel like you 're there . Watching this crummy flaw in the picture totally ruins the emotional impact that makes this such a great movie.Bottom line - do not buy this product and do not trust Criterion .	-1
This Blu-ray will not play in any of our Blu-ray players at all ! ! Do't buy the Blu-ray verison , This is a great film ! Just the Blu-ray verison is worthless , Get the non-blu-ray version ! !	-1
Handel 's Oratorio celebrates the steadfast faithfulness of the Christian Theodora in the face of Roman persecution . She wo n't worship Caesar 's gods , by Jove . In Sellars ' retelling , Caesar becomes the American president and the Roman centurions becomeU . S. Navy personnel in orange flight suits with American flags on their sleeves . But this is clearly not a mere updating for audiences unfamiliar with any history prior to Britney Spear 's latest commitment . Despite the DVD cover 's claim that the parable is `` timeless , '' Sellars is , in fact , shamelessly subverting Handel 's work to serve a very timely and political purpose -- to bash America . Bill ( There's-no-easy-way-to-say-I've-sinned ) Clinton was in office when this video was released ( 1996 ) , so it is not just an attack on George ( Mission Accomplished ) Bush . It is nonpartisan in its contempt for a militaristic America.But why would Sellars choose a work celebrating Christianity to make his point when , according to enlightened European thought , the trouble with America is that it is too religious ? If the American president really did persecute Christians -- as Sellars claims on the surface -- would n't that be cause for Sellars and his Glyndebourne audience to celebrate ? Obviously , what Handel understood as Christianity is not what Sellars has in mind . In Sellars ' theology , the nominal Christians of today are death-dealing hypocrites , and the atheist -- but `` spiritual '' ! -- enlightened folks are the `` Christians . '' These touchy-feely `` Christians '' are comfortable with their bodies and often appear to be in orgasmic swoons . No doubt they eat organic vegetables and drive hybrids . And they are persecuted by diet-Coke-drinking Caesar worshippers who , to cap things off , still practice capital punishment by lethal injection.Is this an effective co-opting of religion for radical purposes ? Hardly . As a number of reviewers have noted , the transcendent beauty of Handel 's music makes Sellars ' trendy gimmicks irrelevant . I wonder about the singers . Is it that hard to get a gig these days that one has to sing for the likes of Sellars to put food on the table ? Besides , Sellars wo n't get any kudos from Richard Dawkins ( The God Delusion ) or the other pop intellectuals who have had a belly full of people trying to reinterpret religion to salvage something of value . Dawkins , Harris , Hitchens , Dennett , and others suggest that real religion stinks and that it is time to simply dump it and move on . Sellars should listen up and employ his talents where they fit most naturally -- say in a new production of the Vagina Monologues . Leave Christianity to Handel , Bach , and , well , Christians .	-1
The good : well danced and orchestrated . The bad : 4:3 aspect ratio . Washed out colors . You can get past the poor colors and aspect ratio but why should you have to . This performance or a new one cries out for the Blu-Ray treatment .	-1
Picture quality very poor , acting disappointing and story line unbelievable . I would never have bought this if I had viewed it previously and would not recommend it to anyone . I enjoyed all Jane Austin works , also Elizabeth Gaskill and others , too numerous to list . Absolutely love the Downton Abby series . The only thing this has in common with the others is that they are all set in England .	-1
Three girls become nannies in London in 1902 . Each works for a different household . The three become friends as they meet in the park with their strollers.The first five episodes of the ten are a pleasant , yet lively pace of intrigue within attractive English homes and parks.The pleasantness gives way to intrigue as the scandals , which have been building , explode in episode six . You find you have been lulled into a soap-opera abounding in sin : fornication , adultery , lying , deceit , manslaughter , seduction , extortion , child endangerment and neglect , to name just a few . The film is far from the `` warm-hearted family drama '' advertised on the cover.It is an enticing film . The story is intriguing . The film balances intrigue with pleasant dialogue ; the actors are attractive in attractive costumes ; the acting is fine within attractive surroundings . Children are present . All the good characters weakly display some virtue.It is helpful to know that Laudanum is morphine derived from opium mixed with alcohol , sold over-the-counter then , to relieve pain and induce sleep . Doctors knew it was addictive , and deadly in too large a dose.The characters draw you into the soap opera by displaying promising virtue , but then betraying that virtue ( moving back and forth ) . Opposing minds within the same person . Science says that one mind must eventually win out . Red-head , Nanny Hannah Randall opposes child endangerment in one instance , but fails to inform the parents in another instance , who were due informing ; and the endangerment continues . Hannah appears to wish to do Right , but fails to consistently act with the resolution of one with single mind to see Right through . The aunt expresses her good moral principles , but later gives way to extortion . The older nanny stands against the bad guy , but later makes a subtle statement justifying the seduction , extortion , and malice . The first half is pleasant , but in the end , a couple of the `` good characters '' have lied and deceived , causing devastating harm to another , taking away all the pleasantness . In the end , you have not experienced a world of cheer , humor , music , singing , fun , and characters to admire.A thoughtful film does not need all the scandal . It is interesting enough with the three girls starting jobs as nannies , as servants , the pretty London parks , difficult bosses , other servants , friendships , the charm and mischief of the children , working at doing a good job , what a good nanny is . Add some fun , humor , music , singing , adventures , and characters coming to values to admire.The lack of many good period films makes this pretty , intriguing , soap opera of technical ability , in which good does not win out , appear desirable . You will enjoy the 8 hours , but be left empty in the end , ( Romance without Love ) . I will not keep it.I recommend these better films : `` Pride and Prejudice-2005 , 1996 , & 1940 '' , `` Wives and Daughters '' , `` North and South '' , `` Middlemarch '' , `` All Creatures Great and Small '' , `` Pollyanna-2002 '' , `` Heidi '' , `` Anne of Green Gables '' , `` Under the Greenwood Tree '' , and `` Road to Avonlea seasons 1-6 '' .If you must have a film of intrigue ; `` The Way We Live Now '' is far better , because the bad-guys are openly bad from the start . The 5-hour , series has great acting ; including a young man wasting his family 's money and lying to various girlfriends . If there was not one , very brief , non-graphic , scene of the young-man attempting to rape his girlfriend on a busy street ; I would recommend the film . The film has a moral : that living a life of deceit leads to trouble and emptiness .	-1
`` M '' is an example of a good idea that is poorly executed . Peter Lorre plays a child murderer who is terrorizing a city in Germany to the point where both the police and members of the local underworld are hunting him down . With more action involved , this could have been the `` intense psychological thriller '' that many critics claim it to be , but it is very hard to become emotionally involved in a film when 80 % of the film comprises non-descript characters ( police and gangsters ) sitting around and discussing the need to capture the murderer . It is repetitive to the point of being sleep-inducing and with the exception of Lorre 's murderer ( who barely even appears in the first hour of the film ) , all of the characters feel like the same `` person '' . They have no real distinguishing characteristics . Even by the standards of the time when this was made ( 1931 ) , `` M '' is a slow-moving and uneventful film , which is surprising , since director Fritz Lang himself had already demonstrated that he was capable of making better films with 1927 's `` Metropolis '' , a film which is just as engrossing as any modern film . If you want to see one of Fritz Lang 's `` masterpieces '' , then `` Metropolis '' is the way to go , not `` M '' .	-1
There is much to say of my surprise at the shimmering reviews this pathetic second rate Japanese movie has received here on Amazon . It is this very incongruency that compelled me to interject a grain of lucidity into this vat of oily adulation . Let 's be honest about it -- the movie is horrendous , has very little artistic value , unless you consider the very repetitive shots of the pampas rustling in the wind to be art , and a mundane plot . The only virtues possessed by this flick are its obscurity and er badness -- all requisites for a drinking game with a bunch of degenerated con-vivants . Onibaba is NOT in the same ballpark as Kurosawa by a very long shot . I much rather recommend Kwaidan as far as old Japanese horror goes . Hope you do n't fall into the snares , but if you must , do n't be fooled into the pretense of substance .	-1
I got this today and watched it , it is a 60 minute long French produced poor quality video that is in sub-titles . Nothing new about it or in it , just a French guy talking about what happened . The pics and video are harsh but nothing different then what is already out there . Save the money and skip this one . Use the funds saved to put towards the Blu-ray version of The World At War Series .	-1
After watching this DVD I was so depressed and disappointing . There was nothing newand it was n't well edited . I watched it and then I threw it away . Waste of moneyand my time .	-1
Okay , I am a fan of Welles , and believe that all of his films should be released in the most pristine perfect version possible . So to watch this monstrosity of a DVD pained me more than anything . I could n't enjoy the film because the limitations of the disc were so annoying . First off , this is not a clean print . The image looks horrid and the sound is not much better . Laserlight really just dumped the picture and ran . Is the film good ? Yeah , it 's not his best film , but it 's still entertaining . But I 'll pick up another copy sometime when a company that cares about it releases it . This versions cheap becuase it 's not very good .	-1
Welles gathered up his own money to make this , something of a European & quot ; Citizen Kane. & quot ; It 's an overblown mess , due probably to the fact that the distributor pulled it out of Welles ' hands and butchered it.Robert Arden plays Guy Van Stratten , a man hired by Mr. Arkadin ( Welles , sporting heavy makeup and an awful performance ) to dig up some info about his past ( Arkadin is suffering from amnesia , you see ) . However , when Van Stratten goes out to interview people , they all turn up dead . SUSPENSE ! The DVD looks exceptionally poor , mastered from terrible source material . But being an independantly financed Welles film , I 'll assume there was little better in the way of source material . The distortion of the score is inexscusable , however.As in most Laserlight 'Special Edition Classics , ' a black-gloved Tony Curtis gives an introduction . Here , he rambles on about & quot ; Citizen Kane & quot ; and mispronounces the title of & quot ; Mr. Arkadin. & quot ; There is also a trailer for & quot ; Citizen Kane. & quot ;	-1
There are some funny moments here , particularly with the dysfunctional family around a dinner table , but aside from that , this movie is awful , a bore , stupid , moronic , like most of Fellini 's work .	-1
The Lady Vanishes by Alfred Hitchcock is about an hour and a half . I have all but 2 or 3 of Hitch 's films . This is one of the first I bought on AMZ because it was presumably remastered by Criterion on a blu-ray . But I soon found that it was remastered in the original 4:3 aspect ratio , not the full screen 1.77 listed in your Product Details , which should be changed . I have two more Criterion blu-rays that are also 4:3 ( The 39 Steps and The Man Who Knew Too Much ) . This is perfect if your TV was purchased in 1938 when this film was released . I was born after that year , so I have no idea if TVs even existed that long ago . I am sure that blu-rays did not exist in 1938 . I love blu-rays , but If all my blu-rays looked like this one , I would throw them all away.I like Hitchcock films or I would n't have bought so many of them , but this one did n't impress me.There are some positive reviews here . Read them and write a positive review if you like the film . I have written many enthusiastic reviews for Hitchcock films . I 'm sorry , but I did n't even notice that Miss Froy was missing , whoever she was .	-1
I thought-someone told me that-Ed McBain was the writer of the short story , where the movie was based on.That 's why I bought it.I did not find any confirmation or clue on this.Can anyone help me , I am intriged.Thanks.P.S.Movie is OK. if you like this japanese form of art .	-1
I ca n't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd . This is a great movie , do n't get me wrong . It 's Kurasawa , after all . My one star is for the people at Mei Ah who put out this dvd . Whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak English well enough to graduate from a level one ESL class . The subtitles are truly terrible , sometimes bizarre , and I thought at times I was dreaming I was watching a Monty Python skit . Alas , I was not ; this was for real . Such a shame .	-1
This movie is right up there with Killer Tomato's.As a previous reviewer said , you do not know what the characters names are . The father is writing and making notes from a map then tries to shoot the children , ends up setting the car on fire and killing himself.If ever a book was trashed this movie director did it . Read the book please . In the book there is a plane crash , in this movie the father drives out into the `` bush '' the girl if she had any sense would would have followed the marks the car tires had made and made it back to civilization instead she walks the other way .	-1
I look forward to Ken Russell 's Mahler listening to the hype , but it ended up in a horrible disappointment . Never mind if it 's an art movie , Ken Russell ended up making more of an abstract mess of what-he-thought was an interpretation of Mahler 's life . If you can stomach bizarre movies like Monty Python 's The Meaning of Life , then you can bear the scenes like the Mahler 's mock funeral and the Conversion with Cosima Wagner . I do n't mind all of these supposedly symbolic and dream-like scenes of Mahler , but it expands little on his private life unlike movies like Amadeus and Immortal Beloved , no matter if the movies are partly fictional . I was under the impression that Robert Powell was going to conduct his Symphony no 8 and then Mr Russell will accompany the score with more symbolic events or picture narratives . It did n't happen eventually . There are vital stories of Mahler 's life that are missing ; how he became a world-class maestro from being a lowly conductor in a spa resort , his reputedly eccentric tantrums with his players , struggle with anti-Semitism in Vienna , how he met Alma Schindler and of course , the triumphant performance of his life ; the Eighth Symphony.It also seems that Ken Russell made this film as if intended for only Mahlerians . Sadly , viewers will be left baffled about Mahler by the end of the film . How are they suppose to understand the justopoxition of irony in scenes of Mahler 's childhood ? ( for example , Mahler 's father found out his son had skipped piano class and the whole family was struggling from getting Mahler hurt , the scene where young Mahler locked himself in a storeroom was accompanied by brass band music ) . Viewers do not understand why Mahler dominated his wife to such an extent she was forbid to compose . We did n't see Mahler conduct any orchestra at all except for the part he imagined himself conducting a Landler in his home . What is so damned special about Mahler ? What is the hype ? In Amadeus , moviegoers familiar by Mozart are convinced by his genius through demonstrations shown in film.The music in this film is AWFUL to extent Mahler 's music is clattered around the film as snippets using when suited to Russell himself . Haitink is n't a mature Mahlerian yet compared to Bernstein and most of the music conducted by Haitink is trash , even though at his later years his interpretations mature steadily . Seriously , I thought it was led by some Hollywood conductor when at the ending credits , I can not believe the soundtrack was conducted by Bernand Haitink ! Simply baffling when considered his interpretation of Symphony no 9 is so legendary that Deryck Cooke , a Mahler scholar , declared it the finest he ever heard.To sum it up , if you 're looking for chronological biography of a film like Amadeus , this is a let down . If you 're a Ken Russell fan , a rent is considered . Otherwise , just stay your bloody hands elsewhere .	-1
Viewed : 6/14Rate : 36/14 : Coming off dreck of a picture called Schlock Corridor , I begin The Naked Kiss with great reluctance . As expected , it 's another tacky dreck in Samuel Fuller 's oeuvre . Although it is a bit better than the other one , The Naked Kiss is wildly hokey because obviously the film is meant to be an addition of high camp into the list of cult films . The acting is horribly amateurish , the direction is quite lame , the editing is shoddy , the campiness is hammy , and the plot is laughably poor . There are too much singing and pirate stuff to sit through ; even at one point , I ca n't believe how unbelievably long one particular singing scene was because my mind was literally rolling over throughout . Constance Towers , who was 30 in the film , looks at least 50 . By the time the perversion is revealed , it does n't look anything much to me for a moment there yet Kelly has to kill the pervert to justify her disgust . Yeah , I believe that 's murder one , no matter how everybody slices it . Of course , it gets manipulative and corny from thereon . The Twilight Zone did churn out better episodes that took up a fraction of the time . All in all , The Naked Kiss is a piss poorly made picture .	-1
DVD transfer is B & W ; and very good to excellent . Criterion offers its usual bonuses which , frankly , are more interesting than the film itself.I would like to say that the viewer will be treated to an exceptional film noir but , unfortunately , the film winds up as an overly-dramatic , overly-sappy B movie . We begin with a bald prostitute beating a man unconcious with her shoe . Shocking , yes , and it gives the viewer the impression they are about to see something on the order of 'Psycho ' or 'Repulsion ' . Instead , our protaganist , Kelly , ( Constance Towers ) winds up as fallen woman making admends for her former life by working in a crippled children 's hospital , struggling to keep a friend from becomming a prostitute and working her way up the social ladder in a small town . She meets and falls for the town 's local millionaire and things seem fine until , we once again find Kelly beating a man , this time to death . The man is her fiance . The dead man is determined to be a pedophile ( although we are hard pressed to figure out just what it is the man was doing ) and our film finally ends with Kelly vindicated . Yep , that 's the plot and I 'm not sorry I spoiled it.It has been rumored that the studio changed and altered Samuel Fuller 's work and the result is what you see . With a plethora of dark topics to work with , the film just lays there , better fit for a Frank Capra touch than film noir . Prostitution and child molesting are sensationalist topics , even today , and this is what keeps 'The Naked Kiss ' on the shelves , that and the name Fuller in the credits.Recommended for Constance Towers fans but not fans of Samuel Fuller or film noir .

Normally I 'd write a long review explaining in detail why this film is so tiresome and pretentious , but what 's the point . If you 've conned yourself into thinking this is a great intellectual experience about mystery and uncertainty and exploration of the clash of Victorian repressed sexuality with untamed wilderness , well I do n't think I can change your mind . ( Though I do commend you for both your creativity and your capability for self-delusion . ) This film is a mystery with no explanation , indeed , no clues , really . I do n't really mind that there 's no explanation , but the dearth of any real clues , anything to contemplate at all irritates me to no end , and makes the film ultimately pointless . That 's what it comes down to : This film not only does n't connect the dots , it does n't even provide them . We 're told so little that we really ca n't even speculate or imagine various potential explanations for the disappearances , not with out stepping so far outside of what we actually know from the film as to make it utterly unrelated to the film itself . Perhaps this could 've worked , not explaining the mystery as a whole but still handing us enough interesting tidbits to chew on , but they did n't give us much , so we 're left with nothing to consider . Now , I try to be a generic critic , and to look at what a film is trying to accomplish and judge it by its own standards , so I 'll give the film this much : It was doubtless meant to be a film about nothing where nothing happens and nothing is explained . However , I ca n't help but suggest that this is not a wise approach to film making . Inscrutability is not an end in and of itself . Indeed , if that 's what you want , you might as well just not make a film at all . That 's a lot cheaper and more efficient , and would , again , leave us with precisely as much to think about as one does after watching ` Picnic at Hanging Rock'.More significantly , ` Picnic at Hanging Rock ' simply does n't work as a mood piece either . I can enjoy purely mood-driven , plotless filmmaking , but 'Picnic At Hanging Rock ' ca n't generate anything consistently . The cinematography and scenery are nice , but not quite ominous or majestic enough to have much of an impact , and the music generally sounds good in and of itself , but is too overwrought , making the film feel rather silly much of the time . ( This is particularly bad as they reach the highest points by the rocks , and one chick spins and spins for no reason and the silly music blares out over cheesy edits and I 'm sure it 's all supposed to be so dramatic , but it just does n't fly . ) This is something I can back down on , I suppose . Many people will be affected by the atmospherics of the film , and I can live with it being praised on this level , even if I do n't agree . But I wo n't stand for people suggesting that this film has any thematic depth or intelligence whatsoever . It is simply a void to be filled by whatever the viewer wishes to put in it . ( This is exemplified by the hilariously trite fatalistic musings that pop up at times concerning the rock 's age , and how people may be doing something for some purpose even if they do n't know it and so on . Truly ridiculous , facile [ ... ] ) Not RecommendedGrade : D	-1
Yes , Miranda was quite pretty , and yes , the period customs were compelling , but sometimes we forget that the nature of cinematic drama demands there be a story , a plot which maintains our interest from beginning to end . Aristotle said it first in his Poetics : a drama must have a beginning , a middle , and an end , all of which must contribute to its essence ( I paraphrase ) . Here there was a good beginning but little middle and no end . This movie had too much of lingering scenic mood shots and too little of dramatic substance . People who like this kind of film will probably like & quot ; The Thin Red Line & quot ; . Those who , like myself , found TRL pretentious and silly will probably reach for the FF button during this one .	-1
It may seem sacrilegious to criticize this classic 1935 Hitchcock movie , one that has entered the public perception as the definitive The 39 Steps . However , one needs to remember that Hitchcock claims to be adapting a book for the screen , a book which bears little to no resemblance to the Hitchcock classic . With this in mind it is remarkably easy to pick apart the 1935 movie and recognize faults that lay squarely with the grand master Hitch rather than the source material . One such example is the preposterous Mister Memory episodes that bookend the Hitchcock version , and the subsequent identity of The 39 Steps as a secret organization . In the source novel the 39 Steps are precisely that & # 8211 ; 39 steps . The changes that Hitchcock made to basic plot elements are dumbfounding . If this was ever in doubt , consult the 2008 BBC version , which to my mind is the most faithful adaptation yet of the Buchan novel . Or even the 1978 Robert Powell production which is close to the novel . The Hitchcock 1935 production , and by association its 1959 almost shot-by-shot remake , are examples of some of the worst screen adaptations of an original work . Sure , the movie may be entertaining enough and when I was in college I picked up the Buchan work expecting to read something akin to the 1935 Donat starrer . At the time I was dismayed to discover a book with such a dramatically different plot , but over the years as I viewed other versions ( more faithful versions ) my impression of the 1935 movie soured . I would venture to place it , and the Kenneth More effort 24 years later , as the weakest of the four productions .	-1
LaserLight 's DVD of & quot ; The 39 Steps & quot ; has low sound , but that I could tolerate . Every 1-2 minutes , the DVD skips several frames , causing the picture to freeze for a few seconds & amp ; the sound to be lost , losing a word or two of dialog each time it occurs during speech . Because I 'd read a favorable review of this version , & amp ; because my LaserLight DVD of & quot ; The Lady Vanishes & quot ; plays fine , I thought it might be just one defective DVD . I tried a different seller -- with the exact same defective results.My DVD player has had no problems with any other DVDs I 've played on it .	-1
Terry Gilliam used 1985 technology borrowed from Lucas ' Star Wars films , grabs the best set designers and artists available pre-Batman 's Gotham , and creates a fantasy world of the future that looks a lot like retro-world , London , 1955 . The designers have a fetish for duct piping and electrical wall wiring . It 's fascinating to look at and with an eerie film score , it 's unsettling to say the least.The trouble is : everything goes wrong when the actors recite dialogue and we have to comprehend a screenplay by Leftist playwright , Tom Sheppard . This is overindulgence in fascist nightmares . Imagine the Reagan Administration as the Left in Europe fantasized back in the 80 's . They imagine the Reagan 's incompetent , but Jack-Boot guards keep the populace under control . The environmentalists have been murdered and the world is a cross between an underground shopping mall and a desert wasteland with smokestacks spewing black soot . Jonathan Pryce is the `` Little MAN '' avoiding promotion to the lethal Records Retrieval Department of the totalitarian government . He falls for his dream fantasy , a blonde angel . To capture her attentions , he unintentionally becomes a suspected terrorist . The rest of the movie is an early prototype of the Mario Brothers . The laughs are far and few between . Not even spectacular visuals can keep a very long , long movie interesting .	-1
I 'm all for creative films , which I thought this was supposed to be . It is n't . It 's such a simplistic and random retelling of `` 1984 '' it makes even videogames like Half Life 2 look sophisticated by comparison , and that 's not saying much . I realize now when people call a film classic you have to ask if they mean a `` nerd '' classic like The Matrix , or Brazil , or something that 's of genuine cultural value . This is definitely a nerd classic , and not the latter . Be warned , unless you have an uncommon love of mechanical things and little emotional resonance within you , this movie is just long , boring , and cheesy as hell .	-1
This collection features two alternate versions of BRAZIL -- both of which truly stink when compared to the original . One is edited to death by the film 's infamously possessive producer , the other liberally enlarged ( and dramatically weakened ) by the director . Together , the two `` cuts '' make a terrific case against any one person having total control of their creative output.This collection also features a so-so documentary called THE BATTLE OF BRAZIL , about the public war waged between the director and the producer over the film 's content -- frankly , THE HAMSTER FACTOR ( a brief documentary on the 12 MONKEYS DVD ) was much a more insightful look at Gilliam 's unique brand of stubborn genius than what 's featured here.So even if you 're a real big Gilliam fan , I 'd just rent this one -- it 's useful to see all of this stuff , but it does n't garner repeat viewings .	-1
Terry Gilliam 's `` Brazil '' is a mess of a film . Its vision of the future as an unending bureaucratic jungle will strike a resonant cord with the modern-day viewer , but its story of a man trapped in an Orwellian nightmare is disjointed , confusing , unsatisfying , and ultimately empty . Its theme of a man trying to find his humanity in an inhumane system is a powerful one , but a powerful theme loses much of its vigor if it is examined in a sloppy manner . That unfortunately is the case with `` Brazil . `` In the near future , Sam Lowry ( Jonathan Pryce ) tries to maintain his sanity while carrying out one monotonous task after another at work . He often finds himself imagining himself as an armored-angel who gloriously flies through the skies , but these daydreams only offer temporary respites from his empty life . However , Lowry starts to become a different man when two strangers enter his life - Archibald 'Harry ' Tuttle ( Robert DeNiro ) , a repairman who defies the systematic inefficiency of society by making unauthorized repairs on his own and Jill Layton ( Kim Greist ) , a truck driver who turns out to be the woman of his dreams . Lowry becomes emboldened as Tuttle inspires him to rebel against the state and Layton provides him with a reason to rebel against the state . Yet , the power of the state is absolute and Lowry soon becomes a victim of its complete and impersonal wrath.The production design of `` Brazil '' is breathtaking . Gilliam effectively brings to life a distinct time and place that rivals the bleak and sterile world of Ridley Scott 's `` Blade Runner '' ( 1982 ) . However , this wondrous setting is wasted on a film that has no coherent narrative . `` Brazil '' is a product of a stream-of-consciousness storytelling style in which the message of the film never reaches the viewer because it is so clumsily delivered . Pryce and DeNiro drift aimlessly from one scene to another and produce a pair of performances that skews toward embarrassing . Griest is even more problematic in her role as she has virtually no screen presence whatsoever . It is well known that the final cut of `` Brazil '' was tampered with by studio executives , but the restored version proves that the film was already doomed even before it was excessively edited . It matters not which version of `` Brazil '' you watch because neither version works . This project was just too unfocused and underdeveloped to begin with .	-1
The cover of CHARADE that 's pictured here , with the movie 's title in blue , is a repro of a mid-1980s off-brand videotape ( from GOODTIMES , perhaps ) . I know because I bought this exact VHS at a New Haven discount store in 1986 , right after getting my first 2-head VCR.Those were NOT the days , let me tell yah ! Back then , quality videos were intended for purchase only by rental stores ( or the very wealthy ? ) . List prices of over a C-note were the norm . This was almost a quarter century ago too , back when a dollar was worth ... something ... The tape itself ( as I recall ) was recorded in LP speed and although it tracked fairly well , condition of its stressed source film was lousy : faded colors and a bit blurry , plus audio was not HiFi ( the process had n't been introduced yet ) . Sound was weak with hiss from the VCR 's stationary linear head ( the type that 's used in cassette decks ) . Of course audio was monaural , but so 's the movie.CHARADE is an excellent motion picure , and surprisingly , it 's been in the public domain for decades now . Best advice : seek out a studio dub ( if such a thing exists ) rather than gray market or budget label product . A long time ago we had to settle for such low quality as you 'll find here . Happily , those days are gone ( if not forgotten by some ) .	-1
NOTE : The stars are for the quality of the streaming presentation , NOT for the movie.Charade was a wonderful mystery , with the charming Cary Grant at the top of his game . Audrey Hepburn was nave and spunky , and the two had witty , clever dialogue throughout the film.Actors like Walter Matthau , George Kennedy , and James Coburn brought their substantial skills to the project , and the result is a top notch comedy/thriller.Unfortunately , this streaming version appears to be time compressed . The picture is jumpy , and the dialogue seems to be a bit frenetic in places ... common symptoms indicating time compression . I can not recommend it at all.Also beware the DVD release from Front Row features . It looks like a picture recorded from a TV antennae signal during a thunderstorm , and the sound is scratchy and annoying too .	-1
76us Charade by Stanley Donen ( 1963 , 113 ' ) An old American film directed by Stanley Donen , starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn , plus few minors , among which Walter Matthau , James Coburn and George Kennedy . It spans four genres : suspense thriller , romance , chick flick and comedy . All and none , in a way.As a particlar flair of the US cinema at the time , like Billy Wilder 's Irma la douce , same year , it has been filmed in olala Paris , to a Henry Mancini score and theme song . Olala Paris has the sex appeal of Playboy bunnies , equallly forgettable Ersatz.Acting has been better by all , they seem to miss US film canteen culture after work . Except for some rude style of speech and behaviour - a well-known reactive uncertainty of operating in a foreign language environment - Europe seems of little inspiration , and the local US Embassy the only safe haven in such .

Um , excuse me ( you extremely long-winded ) guys ... ... but the fact that this film is mastered , or `` projected '' , if you will , at a speed in excess of the speed at which it was photographed makes it DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH ! I mean , come on , is this the damn KEYSTONE COPS or something ? ! Is a lovable mutt going to chomp onto Joan 's hem and not let go ? Is a group of monks going to transport a huge pane of glass across a city street soon ? Will a jailer discard a banana peel as he leads Joan to her doom ? I was under the impression that most people who know a little bit about film ( the Criterion people , maybe ? ? ) know of the necessity of accommodating for this speed difference . Until someone pulls their head out of their *** , and does this film right , it will be impossible for me to judge its effectiveness or lack thereof .	-1
After the problems with the Hrabal text in I served the King of England ( see my review ) , Kundera suffers a similar fate . Lets start with quoting the beginning of the Wikipedia review , which sets the scene as follows : `` The Unbearable Light-ness of Being is a 1988 American film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Milan Kundera , published in 1984 . Director Philip Kaufman and screenplay writer Jean-Claude Carri & egrave ; re show Czechoslovak artistic and intellectual life during the Prague Spring of the Communist period , before the Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968 , and detail the moral-political effects and personal consequences upon a bohemian m & eacute ; nage & agrave ; trois : a medical doctor and his two women . `` This is definitely not the Kundera of his many books , and Jean-Claude Carri & egrave ; re , else an excellent script writer with/for eg Bu & ntilde ; uel 's last six films or so , must have gotten too much under Kaufman 's thumb or not have given a damn once he saw where things were going , but must certainly have been paid well . What we more generally have is a money no problem fashion product by a fashion director with international staff . The Czechoslovak atmosphere of 1968 caught by a film-crazy , unrealistically brave youngster ( some would call her dumb and stupid ) , and while most locations would be authentic , the film has nothing Czech about it . It could have been anywhere , mostly New York , the revolt probably in Chile.I have not found any review of the film by Kundera himself , but knowing his work , I would expect that his comments were not kind . After a positive ( but rather shallow and uneducated , very American ) first review in the Criterion Collection by Michael Sragow ( 1/11/1999 ) , twelve years down the line , Mark Lova ( 31/1/2011 ) , in a very clear analysis , sums up the arguments `` It 's a good question : Why care what Kundera says ? I did assume that some people would care . I think if you want to do more than be a consumer of art , if you think that movies and books are not just things you use once and then throw away , you should care too . Obviously , you might like the book , and not care about the film , or you might like the film , not the book . ( etc . ) However , if you care about the book , you might at least wonder what Kundera was complaining about . `` Where does that leave me ? As I have expressed elsewhere at some stage , I do not like falsifications , and Kaufman 's film to me clearly falls into that category . If you already refer to the author and title of the original book , you should show more respect - or is it simply skill ( as opposed to money ) ? 62-12 February 2012	-1
`` The Unbearable Boredom of Watching . '' That 's what this movie should have been titled . It is a long , relentless , punishingly dull movie following the lives of three people intertwined by a common relationship with each other . Two of them , Tomas and his mistress , Sabina , are talented yet shallow hedonists who seem to have no interest in pursuing anything greater or more meaningful than sexual gratification . Tomas ' young wife , Tereza , is a sad , pathetic , naive woman who is devoted to her husband despite her knowledge of his ongoing affair with Sabina . The story takes place in the 1960 's era of Communist oppression in Czechoslovakia.After spending about 3 hours watching this movie , one comes away struggling to find some meaning in it all . There were opportunities to make an interesting movie -- the tension between the women who share a common lover , the impact of Communist oppression on the lives of Tomas and his wife are but two examples -- but the writers and director chose an incredibly boring and meaningless path instead . There are several episodes of gratuitous sex , nudity , and a lengthy homoerotic scene between Sabina and Tereza that add nothing to the meaning , quality , or entertainment of this movie.I can really find no reason to recommend this movie . If you are looking for a love story or a fascinating tale about interesting people and their lives , you will be sorely disappointed . Only someone who can find meaning watching the clothes dryer at a laundromat would find this movie interesting .	-1
terrible ! i was fooled by some critics ' high praises to this movie and tried pretty hard to seek this movie out . but doom on me , this movie is so pretentious , so ridiculous , so snail-crawling slow . the screenplay is also deadbeat . whole movie with amber lens painted everything in brownish color . the dialog , my god , it 's also so boring and i often found myself could n't keep my attention to what 's going on . if you tried to tell me it 's so good , so deep , so ... ..then you must be from another planet . i do n't mind admitting that i could n't grasp the least meaning , the reason why this movie could be realized into production . watching it is exactly like reading john le carre ' deadbeat novels , every one of them . i wo n't give a rat 's a.. whether this serial killer case could be solved or not , because i do n't want to be murdered by this movie , by its extreme serial boredom . i better rest my case before it 's too late .	-1
What do you do when you 've got a sensuous , sexy wife who has a strong need to mate with the alpha male , even if that male is n't you ? Why , you slap her around a little , and wow ! she is swooned by your commanding style and your marriage is saved.This , believe it or not , was standard psychology back in the fifties . It was the hidden , `` Freudian '' kind of subconscious understanding about women known only to the most experienced and sophisticated of men.I guess I need to say that this is not a very good movie and whatever you do , do n't get the dubbed version . The woman reading Brigitte Bardot 's lines sounds like an annoying cosmetics school drop out while the translations of the everyday French greetings and idioms are stupid in the extreme . I would say do n't even bother with this , but this IS Brigitte Bardot at twenty-two , the crme de la crme of sex kittens displayed here in her bare feet avec quick shots of her perfect caboose and very pouty mouth . For all connoisseurs of the type , e.g. , Marilyn Monroe , Liv Ullmann , and lately Drew Barrymore , women who radiate pure sex and sensuality , whose nature is so naturally warm and loving that they can not resist stray dogs-or stray men-BB is not to be missed . I just wish they knew how to use a camera in those days and were n't so darn prudish .	-1
This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film . `` Matresse '' or `` Mistress '' in my opinion , is one of the worst three films to be released on the Criterion Collection . The only reason I watched and reviewed it is because it was released by Criterion . The film contains very explicit depictions of sadomasochistic activity some of which involve nailing body parts to blocks of wood . There is also a graphic scene of a horse being slaughtered for meat as well as numerous scenes of people eating horsemeat that horse lovers may be highly offended by . It got an X-rating by the MPAA and was banned in many parts of the US.The film is about a woman who secretly operates a sex dungeon in her basement . When her apartment is broken into , the burglar falls in love with her.The only special feature on the DVD is an interview with the film 's director , Barbet Schroeder .	-1
Because I sure did ! I 'm a big fan of Asian horror/drama/suspense or whatever you want to call them movies . I 've watched tons of them and there are some really good ones out there . I popped this movie in expecting to see the same , and what do I get ? 137minutes of NOTHING ! The first hour of the movie is just talking about absolutely nothing . A boring housewife and her boring husband with his boring job where he uses 1960 's recording equipment in the year 2000 ! They continue to torture you with their boring life for 60 minutes then by chance they happen to unfortunately cross paths with a young girl who escaped being kidnapped . Well what do these good people do ? Well that 's what the other 37minutes are for ... so you can sit there and watch them make stupid decision after stupid decision . You 'll be yelling at them ! Cursing at them ! JUST CALL THE POLICE YOU MORONS ! you 'll be yelling only to watch their bright ideas fall flat on their face . This is another movie where people rate 4-5 stars and the movie is actually crap . Then a good Asian suspens/horror/action movies made on a low budget like Onechanabra Samuari Bikini squad will get 2 stars , The Red Shoes will get 2 stars , and some other great movies actually worth watching will get 1 or 2 stars.Maybe it 's me but I do n't get it . There 's really great films with low budgets but great action sequences like Onechanabra that should get more praise . There 's out of the ordinary films will great stories like `` The Red Shoes '' that should get more attention ... but a boring non original film like Seance gets 4-5 stars ? give me a break . This movie rips elements straight from the 6th sense and Sympathy for Mr.Vengeance ( another really great movie ! ) . It 's said this is based someone on an old movie from the 60 's . I have n't seen it so I ca n't compare ... but this movie is extremely bland do n't get fooled .	-1
The premise of the film is the damage caused by the central character 's damage to others and themselves becuase of a sexual affair . Here it is Irons affair with Binoche , the latter plays the formers , Son 's girlfriend.The damage caused to this pleasent surburban family is entirely plausible , this kind of selfish and destructive love affair happens all the time , it just is n't believable and seems to go just too far.I can understand why the writer may have wanted to show the spread of the damage , like the rings and ripples around a stone thrown in a river ; but it justs get worse and more gut wrenchingly horrfic so as to render the viewer little more than a rubbernecker to a motorway crash.Graves as the tragic Son gives a tidy performance and Richardson as the Wife and Mother is excellent . Irons and Binoche just try too hard and render their characters little more than cold and hateful psychopaths , I know the point of their characters was that we should n't care what becomes of them ; but surely not to the point where the film is abandoned.I cared so little I could n't be bothered to watch anymore !	-1
Although this movie does have some intriguing points and does a good job of bringing up age old scepticism , it inadequatly depicts Christianity by demonizing religon and lionizing the proud and rebelious.Mimi Rogers who plays Sharon does a few things that make me wonder why so many people would feel sorry for her.First of all ( and I blame this largely on Hollywood ) when Sharon decides to turn a new leaf and try to better herself AKA not sleeping around in promiscuous group sex , she instantly goes to a 180 extreme by rigid rules and preaching to others instead of knowing God , loving God , treating herself and others with reaspect and trying to lead a decent life.Hollywood always makes this statement that you 're either extremely pious or you indulge in every kind of sin ; no inbetween , how unoriginal and closeminded.Secondly , she kills her daughter one day before the rapture not because God told her to , but because of her own lack of faith.All she had to do was wait ONE DAY ! That in itself shows her selfishness and how shallow her soul is.Lastly , near the end of the movie , when she is sooo angry with God ( why I do n't know , God did not order her to kill her daughter ) she has the chance to be reunited with her daughter in Heaven if she would just accept God and His commandments.Naturally being the idiot that she is , she refuses.If any human is that proud and that self-absorbed then they do n't deserve to be in Paradise.I really like Mimi Rogers , but this script was so sterotypical and biased that it would turn away anyone who was considering a religous life .	-1
I thought I carefully read the reviews before purchasing this movie , but perhaps I did n't read enough of them . Cultish and distorted to say the least . More like an excuse for gratuitous sex scenes , and to make Christians look like nut cases . No one would really learn much about the Rapture from this movie , or about what it means to be saved through faith in Jesus Christ . But you will learn about swinging and sexual positions , if that interests you . Unfortunate .	-1
`` The Rapture '' ( 1991 ) is directed by Michael Tolkin with Mimi Rogers as a LA telephone operator who spends her after work hours cruising with her boyfriend in the search of the other couples to swing the partners . She realizes that her life has no purpose and leads her nowhere and she turns to a religious sect for spiritual guidance ... It 's been several weeks since I saw the film and I am still not sure what it was , a riveting dark drama about searching for faith , accepting spiritual awakening , preparing yourself for the second coming of Christ and for Apocalypses now or the ridiculous piece of trash . I think it could be both and it depends on how you feel toward the Christianity , the possibility of undergoing a religious conversion , and the readiness to sacrifice the most precious that you have to prove your faith and love for God . It also depends on how you feel about the dialogs in the movie - the quote that I 've chosen for the title of this review may give you an idea of what to expect.What I am sure of is that Mimi Rogers gave a fine performance , and she is a reason enough to see `` The Rapture '' . Rogers is a very capable and attractive actress and should be recognized more.2.5/5	-1
The Extended Director 's Cut is definitely NOT more uproarious than the original DVD version . I watched about 10 minutes of this Blu-ray version , grabbed the case and saw that it was a different version from the original . I ejected the Blu-ray and popped in my DVD original version . This Directors cut gave me a new appreciation for the job of editing movies . I looked up the editor of the original version . John Carter you did an excellent job of editing on the original DVD version . I do n't know how much if anything you had to do with this `` Directors cut '' version but it sure does change the whole mood of the movie . Director F. Gary Gray did a wonderful job of directing but he should have left the movie unchanged for the Blu-ray release . The original DVD version is CLASSIC , 5 stars ( even with Ezal 's exaggerated acting ) . The Director 's version simply `` screws up the mood '' and is worthy of one star . Future Blu-ray releases should be the original version only with the scenes that were originally cut and that you want the audience to see in a `` deleted scenes '' menu.Note : F.Gary Gray had a minor role as the kid sweeping in the neighborhood market .	-1
I thought this movie was supposed to be funny and entertaining , but it was neither . It was so painfully boring that about 40 minutes in I could n't watch any more . Ice Cube & Chris Tucker are capable of being funny , but good comedic actors ca n't compensate for a rotten screen play and poor direction .	-1
Do n't get the Director 's cut/Deluxe Edition . They ruined it by adding deleted scenes that were deleted for a reason ! Buy the original if you want this movie ; do n't buy this version if you want the classic . They just added scenes for a bullet point on the back of the case for a selling point .	-1
I invited three of my friends over to watch this and all three of them left half-way through the movie it was so bad . The dialouge is awful and the story is boring . Just because people sit around doing nothing in real life does n't mean it 's interesting to watch.Only hardcore Ice Cube fans will like this movie . If you want to see a good Ice Cube movie watch Anaconda .	-1
This movie is just plain terrible . All the potential - the story , the poetry , the actors , the director - is entirely wasted . DiCaprio , while admirable in accepting such a role , is all but unwatchable , in that his acting is too self-cetered ( there is little or no connection to the other actors ) and his character comes off at the beginning as a rude , snotty brat and goes downhill from there . Thewlis tries to play symapthetic as Verlaine , but is betrayed by the poor writing . Romane Bohringer , easily the sole redeeming feature of the film , is in a role too small and unimportant to make enough of a difference . Worse , while the cinematography is at times compelling , the direction shows Holland at a career low . There is no chemistry , no intimacy among the characters , no matter how naked they get . The fire , the spark fueling Rimbaud 's poetry , is smothered by the deadweight of the badly-written script . There is no reason to believe these two guys care about each other , and no reason to believe we should care about them , either .	-1
If you are looking for a touching and turbulent portrayal of the madness of artists in love , of a tempestuous relationship between two brilliant poets that destroyed one 's life and reputation , then keep looking . If you are looking for something to replace the Rocky Horror Picture Show for a good campy laugh , this is your movie . The entire thing was beyond ridiculous . There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Thewlis , no hint at what would have pulled these two together in an age when the very hint of such a relationship could have been , and in fact was , the ruin of the elder Paul Verlaine ( Thewlis ) . The anorexic appearance of both actors ( and let 's face it folks , when is the cinematic world going to get it that they must never let Thewlis remove his clothes on camera ? ) and the scene of intimacy between them bring to mind the words brutal , abusive , sadistic and horrific . That having been said , be prepared to move quickly from being appalled to laughing riotously at all the wrong places . From crawling around imitating goats ( yes there were real goats there too ) to the frequent frontal nudity displayed by DiCaprio and Thewlis , there are giggles aplenty . I must admit this movie has some of my all time favorite lines . Poet 1 : `` Just shoot me . '' Poet 2 : `` I ca n't you stupid **** you just blew a hole in my hand . '' And lest we forget ... Poet 1 : `` My wife has not been well . '' Poet 2 : `` Perhaps thats because you keep setting her on fire . '' Poet 1 : `` I 'll have you know I have n't set my wife on fire since Thursday . '' Bottom line folks this one is just too painful for words . Even the actors admitted in interviews that instead of method acting they engaged in method drinking to get through the making of this movie . According to those interviews they were well oiled each day of filming . So much that Thewlis admitted he does n't remember making the movie . Now if only we could all forget he made it .	-1
I love Cary Grant , and I love a good black and white . I hate this movie it is soooooooooooooo borning ... but maybe that is just because I am a part of the younger generation that demands unreasonable things from movies . This movie drags and drags and drags.This movie is not nearly as good as so many other cary Grant films ( especially bringing up baby , philedelphia story , arsnic and old lace , and charade )	-1
I typically love anything with Cary Grant or Myrna Loy , but their considerable talents ca n't save this snooze-fest . What a waste .	-1
I bought this movie because of my girlfriend 's recommendation . I told her that I loved the movie `` The Money Pit '' with Tom Hanks and she said I just had to get `` Mr. Blandings Dream House '' . In all fairness , I did not finish seeing the movie to the end but came within a half hour of seeing the entire movie . Why ? Because it was that bad ... not even a chuckle . Even if the last half hour was rip roaring hilarious which I highly doubt , it would not be worth seeing . I love Cary Grant but this movie did not do him justice . The quality of the movie was excellent but who cares if the movie stinks . I do n't know why other reviewers are giving it such high marks . I may be missing something but I 'm not going to waste another 2 hours to find out what it was . Stick with `` The Money Pit '' . It 's the REAL `` Dream House '' .	-1
I was on the edge of my seat watching this movie ... then I fell over asleep ! Let me tell you something , there is absolutely , positively , definitely , NO POINT to this dumb movie . If it was n't for the Don Henley song , this would be totally useless ! How I long for the Vinnie Barbarino days after seeing Travolta embarrass himself in MICHAEL . How about a sequel , MICHAEL II : THIS TIME THERE 'S A POINT !	-1
This is a delightful movie that merits a 7/10.But the shoddy treatment by the studio merits no stars.Movies should be released in the aspect ratio in which they were shown in the cinema.When 's the last time YOU saw a movie in a theatre ( or theater ) that was 1:1.33 ?	-1
Do not buy this movie . If it 's on Showtime , change the channel . You will do yourself a favor . You will save brain cells too . I do n't want to waste your time repeating the above paragraph over and over just because I have the space . Choose a noose over this movie , it 's over faster and you 'll feel the same afterwards .	-1
How far does the Q-tip have to go until this gets funny ? Its unwatchably stupid . I really can not put my finger on why I dislike this movie so much , I just do . It could be Jim Carrey 's stupid faces he makes throughout the movie . Like that whole fish face thing in his dream sequence before he gets punched out . Stupid beyond all recognition . Its ashame , too , because I do like Jim Carrey . Its one of those movies where I imagine myself sucker-punching the main characters . I feel like I am out of the loop because everyone I know loves this movie .	-1
I know so many people who love this movie that I decided to give it a try . I found it so boring that I actually fell asleep during it .	-1
It *isn't* a very good movie , no argument there . A few interesting ideas stewed together with some pretty explicit and sometimes weird sex , pretty much sums it up . Not much else is here : story , believable , developed characters , a sensible premise , etc . But it 's interesting as a curiousity ... something to see if you think it sounds at all interesting . And hey-ho , that James Spader is still rockin ' strong !	-1
I did not find Crash shocking or challenging . I did find it sad and depressing . If that was Cronenberg 's intent , he succeeded admirably.What I could not find in the movie was any human motivation anywhere in these characters . Their joyless couplings become repetitive and are meant to express ... .what ? That they are so alienated and jaded that only by the severest forms of sensation ( car crashes , injury , mutilation ) can they become sexually arroused ? Well , that was conveyed in the first 30 minutes . And then is repeated ad nauseum until the final scene , with neither growth or any further insight for the characters or the audience.We live in an age where people do disfigure themselves , often in some sort of sexual expression . And that our car culture has sexual undertones is no new revelation ( just look at the advertising ) . But this movie neither explains nor offers any insight into any of that . It just observes their motiveless self-destructive behavior , turning the audience into voyeurs.I like many of Cronenberg 's other efforts . I admire the cast , though I would love to hear them explain what they think these people are doing and why.At some point observation of alienation and depravity crosses the line and becomes that alienation and depravity . This comes uncomfortably close to that . Maybe I 'm just weary of this kind of new age existential despair . If your worldview is this bleak , I pity you.At any rate , I give it 2 stars because it is well-made and a curiosity piece . It obviously will stimulate some thought . But , it is empty , cold and heartless at it 's core and offers no great insight into the human condition . Matter of fact , there is n't a recognizable human being anywhere in sight .	-1
A horrible movie in every way . Glorfies the many aspects of modern society that are wrong today to include promiscuous sex and reckless driving . It is a shame that movies like this can even be allowed to be made . This was a step down for ever actor invovled in .	-1
Even during the most extreme of my liberal moments , I ca n't give & quot ; Crash & quot ; any better than two stars , although I will give credit to Cronenberg for being just about the only director with the balls to take on this project.J.G . Ballard 's & quot ; Crash & quot ; , like Henry Miller 's & quot ; Tropic Of Cancer & quot ; , was not written for the big screen , and no amount of star power could have helped it in the slightest . I see where they 're going with it , but there are almost no redemptive moments in this film . With the exception of the & quot ; James Dean & quot ; re-enaction , which was a moment of exceptionally brilliant irreverence.Unfortunately the film never really gets off the ground . The sex initially tittilates , then repels , then bores . Of course it does n't help when the screenplay is as spare as this one , but then again , that 's the cornerstone of Canadian cinema . James Spader in particular should have thought twice about doing this movie and going the route of Jeremy Irons or Julian Sands , both of whom are stuck on typecast boulevard.Starring in a movie like & quot ; Crash & quot ; wo n't end your career , but it 'll sure help !	-1
I had n't seen this since back in the day . I think back then it was a pretty original idea and that had some impact , but this film does n't hold up in present day the way a classic like Halloween does . Far from it . I found it very slow and not scary at all . My 16 year old daughter thought the same .	-1
Although the movie was shot beautifully , it was too simplistic and dull . It contained a plot with nothing more than just two childish people playing games with each other in a very uninteresting relationship . The supporting actors , who seemed more interesting than Nia and Larenz characters , were wasted and might as well have been cast as extras since thier appearences were so brief . Not that it would help this picture much , but as much as I love Larenz Tate , that role was crying for someone who can carry on as a romantic leading man such as Mikhal Phiffer *I hope I spelled that name right* Like my caption says , skip this video and PICK UP THAT SOUNDTRACK !	-1
My six year old grandson said that the movie was awful , and that he did not enjoy it at all .	-1
I loved this movie when it was released in theaters . I loved it when it was released on Laserdisc ( widescreen ) . I was very excited about the DVD release , hoping for a widescreen edition and maybe some extras . Full screen and bare bones is what we got . What a HUGE disappointment . I 'll keep watching my widescreen Laserdisc until this movie gets the DVD or blu-ray release it deserves . But , I 'm not holding my breath .	-1
Yes folks , it really is THAT bad . Brando is funny playing a loon , but then he gets killed for no good reason . His mini-Brando sidekick is pitifully ugly , too ; you feel sad looking at him . David Thewlis is a fine actor , but he has trouble reacting properly to the people in bad make-up and the computer generated mutant rats . Somehow , everything explodes in the end . This is a horrible film , not even so-bad-it's-good ( like , say , Showgirls ) .	-1
As a fan of the character I 'd say this is a disappointment especially considering the fact that Todd himself was involved . I recommend the comics which are available in trade paperbacks or the animated show which is available on DVD because this does n't do justice for the character .	-1
In classical music parlance , this movie is something of a Symphonie Fantastique . It has a lot of fantastic -- meaning out of this world , not necessarily great -- imagry but not much else to recommend.Some of the other reviewers seem to know what 's going on in this movie . It appeared to me the story was two enemies battle each other in a good vs. evil episode . I guess that 's the story here , although that fat clown that turns into a computer-generated dragon wo n't go down in film history as one of the great bad guys of all time.What I did find entertaining were the computer scenes in Hell , where the good guy and a buddy battled the dragon . That was pretty interesting , what with all the heat and flames and darkness along the way.I am not naturally drawn to this kind of movie -- something based on a comic book that is a complete fantasy where just about nothing in the movie could happen in real life.Having said that , I greatly enjoyed and admired `` RoboCop '' when it came out and set a new standard for computer-generated action . I thought about that movie while I watched this hapless drama unfold.This film completely lacks `` RoboCop '' s wonderful direction , action-packed plot and wonderful characterizations but it did have those great scenes in Hell . So I found something worthwhile in this movie that kept my attention.This is about as far from my typical fare as possible and I still wonder how I stumbled on it one night . If this happens to you , stick around and you 'll probably find one thing here you like or enjoy .	-1
... but instead the movie version of Spawn is nothing but a disappointment . The special effects and makeup are great , as is John Leguizamo as Clown , but there is a lot of overacting and the storyline is boggled and shameful for something out of the Spawn universe . It gets two stars for special effects/makeup , and John Leguizamo , other than that , it goes right down the crapper .	-1
I had always had a weird curiosity about this movie but I did n't even remember it existed until recently when a friend mentioned it during a discussion . He basically told me it was one of the worst movies he had ever seen and it peaked my interest even more because it did n't look THAT bad from the previews I remembered.The story/screenplay is laughable at best . The premise is cool and I know the actual comic book is much moe brutal and unrelenting ( which is why this movie seemed like it had some hope , at least ) . The writers did a lot more telling than showing , however , and scenes like Spawn 's `` training '' with Mr. old-guy-always-appearing-out-of-thin-air is just plain ridiculous . It took Luke years to gain even rudimentary knowledge of the Force in Star Wars and yet Spawn seems to learn how to use any ability he wants when a guy tells him that he has `` trillions of nerves '' he can control . Give me a break . Not only is this just plain bad writing , but the director does n't even pass it off well by giving it at least some kind of weight . The scene takes all of a minute to develope and by the end Spawn is able to control more abilities than god just by `` thinking '' of performing the action . Awesome.The actors are likewise a travesty . The guy who plays Spawn does n't have a fully-developed acting bone in his body . Gritting your teeth and talking like you 're a badd-arse from the streets of south-side Chicago does n't constitute believability . Martin Sheene makes his son Charlie look like the best actor in Hollywood , but I do n't really blame him . I 'm sure the director told him to camp up his performance so as to appear like a sadistic madman . The problem is that nothing is developed with his character . He just starts out at `` madman '' and end 's at `` madman . '' The whole `` Spawn fights for his gf '' bologny is just as stupid . We never see them together and do n't get any chance to inest feelings of compassion in either character . We just see a few flashbacks showing his laughable moments of closeness between Spawn and his cardboard gf . The Clown form of Violator was obnoxious and not even slightly funny . He goes from making harmless jokes that are PG-13 to R within the same sentence as well , which makes no sense . If he is going to be lude , make him lude the whole movie . If he is making jokes like Bob Saget , then let him do so for the whole movie . Mixing and matching just made no sense , as if he did n't want to offend poor Spawn . I do n't know where to even begin on the other actors.The story was terrible . I do n't know if it follows the comicbook all that closelly , but I would certainly hope not . Even something like Batman or the X-men often gives a lot of good writing and useful sections that help see the true character of the heroes . Granted , comicbooks offer didactic `` good vs. evil '' montages , but they 're generally done quite well . The whole scheme to get Spawn to command the armies of Hell was n't needed . They could have easily made him do it from the get-go , before he decided to fight for `` good '' . I know they needed some kind of plot , but there are much better ways to try and bring these characters together.I was expecting some cool fight scenes at the very least . Violator is a great villian with a lot of potential , as are all of McFarlane 's creations , the problem is that he is terribly portrayed yet again . He just runs around grabbing people instead of outright destroying them . He would n't toy with his victims by batting them around . Just freakin eat them or smash their faces in . Not only that , but how the heck does something that big and loud `` hide '' from Spawn on more than one occasion ? Honestly . One chase scene does n't even serve a purpose in the film other than to oblige action film fans who seem to think it 's mandatory . Could n't Spawn just fly around instead of riding a motorcycle ? *sigh*The effects for Violator and Spawn 's chains/cape were pretty well done for 1997 , I will say , but thats unfortunatelly the best part of the whole movie and that 's not saying much . The effects usesd to create Hell were also poorly done . It looks more like a big red backdrop that someone threw a bag of Cheetos all over , it was not intimidating in any way ( again , I think this was a poor choice by screenwriter/director to even include this setting when cg effects clearly were n't going to cut it in 1997 ) .It 's not the worst movie I 've ever seen , but it is certainly up there . From the terrible acting to the horrendous script to the poorly constructed `` motivation '' behind anyones actions , it 's just a very bad film . I would hope that someone has the courage at some point soon to renew the interest in the franchise by making a legitimate film with todays technology . The most important part of any film to this day is still a great screenplay , however , and until we get that , this superhero has no hope . I only recommend this to filmmakers who wish to use it as a reference point for what NOT to do or avid fans of the comicbook .	-1
Great if you like random special effects that almost lead to nowhere , overblown production , alot of noise , and a bothersome unfunny clown that laughs at his own clueless jokes . One sickening pizza scene will make you think twice about when to eat when you decide to watch this movie . Even the dialogue seems forced . Spawn fans may be ultimately forgiving , one way or the other .	-1
I am truely sorry for those that this will affend . This movie was a sad attempt of art on film . It was sloppy and poorly written . It perseves teenagers as sex crazed idiots ! I mean really , the guy from Baywatch was a retarded touch . Are braces the new accessory or what ? Almost every female sported them . And the two suicides , come on ! Finding true love was a plot never quenched . DO NOT , I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH THIS PATHETIC MOVIE . Thank you .	-1
This move takes on the grand journey of ... well ... NOWHERE ... My sister gave me the movie too watch and i gave it an open-mind .. had some shocks here and there but then came too the conclusion ... You people are dumb , i 've been had ... there is n't a messege that the title has n't told you already , if you hav n't figurerd out what the movie was going too do , check for a pulse..is the heart rate going well there sparky ... Do n't waste your time or money ... that 's time you will never get back that couldve been used watching something better ... God now i know i can make a movie with no real point and people will be in aw ..	-1
Do n't get me wrong . I like Michael Richards ( Seinfeld is my second favorite show of all time just below the Simpsons ) but this is altogether too ho hum . I never laughed out loud once during this entire movie . There were a few parts that were mildly amusing but the movie could never seem to build any momentum . Just when it would seem like it was getting good it would switch to a scene with Jeff Daniels and suddenly not so funny . Jeff Daniels best comedic role is , of corse , Dumb and dumber and he has a few good moments here but mostly he just plays the straight guy and his scenes just seem to drag the movie down . But I suppose if you like romantic comedy fluff you might not totally hate this movie	-1
this film is a bad joke.the only funny line is by Tucker when he tells Heather Locklear that she is PHAT.= Pretty , Hot & amp ; tempting.any movie with Locklear is a 3rd tier film.she ca n't act on tv commercials.as for Sheen he has always been a 2nd tier Tom Cruise and will always be.this is a weak attempt at Trading Places .	-1
I have seen a staggering number of bad films in my life . `` Gigli '' , `` Glitter '' , `` Armeggedon '' , `` Killing Zoe '' . Awful , tired pieces of filmmaking . But never in my life have I ever , or probably will ever , see a film as truly horrendous as `` Gummo '' .In the English laungage , there are no words to properly say how truly awful this movie is . This is a movie made by dumb people who think they 're smart for dumb people who think they 're smart , point period.If you have never been subject to `` Gummo '' and are curious , as I once was , you may wonder to yourself : what 's it all about ? Well , is a word , nothing . `` Gummo '' is merely a bunch of scenes strung togather with little thought for continuity or story . This is n't `` art '' , ladies and gentleman ; this is contempt for one 's audience.What you do get in these random scenes is things intended that are supposed to be disturbing , or even enlightening , but instead are so obvious and insipid that they are mind numbing . Marvel at two kids who beat cats to death , sell them to the local deli so they can go get spray cans to huff the fumes . Be intrigued by two albino girls jumping on a bed . Be shocked by a drunken man , played by the director , come onto a black midget . See drunken rednecks wrestle a set of chairs for the sheer reason of just doing it . Be offended by a man who sells sex with his retarded sister.Or rather , do n't . There is absolutley nothing shocking , disturbing , enlightning or even interesting to be found in the ninty plus minutes of this `` film '' . This a movie whose only point of even exisitng is so people who think they are into `` art films '' can think the people who do not enjoy this just are n't as smart as they are . These are the same people who think Goddard is the name of some French resturant.This movie is poorly paced , poorly shot , barely written and horribly acted . The charactors are never realistic , the tone , what little bit of a tone there is actully is , changes from scene to scene . There is junst nothing good about this movie.I have nothing but contempt for this movie . I do n't like paying money to see something that believes that I 'm an idiot because I 'm not `` down '' or `` cool '' enough to think that this movie is nothign but a piece of garbage from frame one , a mistake , a waste of time , money , effort , film , lighting , everything that went into the making of it . Harmoney Korine is not an artist . From watching `` Gummo '' . I believe he is a prankster . And the joke , matter of factly , is on all of us who wasted our lives prescious moments on this horrendous piece of garbage.The worst movie ever made . Without doubt .	-1
Recently , I moved to Xenia , so I thought it would be fitting to rent Gummo . It is ridiculous that people gave it 5-star reviews . It 's just a bad movie , and watching it would make any cinematographer physically ill . If you want shock value , There 's Something About Mary has more.There were a few amusing parts . Any movie with Chloe Sevigny , a crazy kid in a bunny suit and a drunk man wrestling a chair deserves a couple stars . The problem is that Gummo masquerades as a quasi-documentary , which is a lie.I 've only lived in Xenia a few months , but I grew up 30 miles away , so I know about the tornadoes . The Xenia tornado was the worst of seven F-5 tornadoes in the 148-tornado Super Outbreak of 1974 . Over 2000 buildings were hit in Xenia , including five schools , and 33 people died . A small tornado hit Xenia again in 1989 , and another large one in 2000 , taking out 50 homes and killing one person.Gummo does not take place in Xenia . There were n't 100 buildings in that whole town . It was filmed in Tennessee , and the racists interviewed are in Tennessee . Xenia is a normal place . It 's ironic that the Chinese restraunts in Gummo serve cats , as Xenia has a strict board of health ( last month they shut down a good restaurant for not having hot enough food ) .When does Gummo take place ? The 1989 tornado was minimal , and Gummo was made before 2000 , so it must be in 1974 . They should have tried to make it look like 1974.The offensive part of Gummo is the message . It opens and closes with tornado footage , and in between shows you that every person is a sick deviant . At the beginning , you think , `` A tornado ! That 's horrible ! '' but at the end you think , `` Thank God for killing white trash ! '' Residents are presented as Sodomites , and the tornado as righteous judgement . The is no character development . There is no story . There is nobody you could possibly sympathize with . The people are barely human .	-1
... '' Gummo '' has no plot ; it 's a series of vignettes about `` life '' in Ohio that ( kind of ) come together . There 's all the stuff that 's `` commonplace '' in the Buckeye State : rape , incest , cat torture , drug use , you name it , it 's there . There 's not much else to say about the movie ; one could extol its virtues , but then one could extol the virtues of early Stalinist propaganda , or `` Die Eternische Juden '' as well . Extol all you want , it does n't change the underlying ignorance and bias inherent in those films - or this one.That being said , `` Gummo '' is exactly the kind of bigoted [ garbage ] that people think small towns are like - specifically , people who have never been to small towns , or the only time they spent in small towns was driving through ( or watching `` Deliverance '' ) . `` Gummo '' was even filmed in Tennessee , using extras from Tennessee - they could n't get the location right , and Korine 's so-called experiment '' by using `` real Ohio people '' is as false as Miss Cleo 's fortune telling.In other words , it 's not reality . It 's a made-up bourgeoisie Candyland created by pseudo-intellectuals who like to turn their nose up at the very people they supposedly want to drag out of corporate oppression . If you REALLY want to learn about small-town Ohio life , go visit Ohio . I can suggest some very nice bed and breakfasts , and central Ohio is wonderful in the autumn . If you REALLY want to depress yourself with someone 's invented fantasy and use your dollars to support ignorance , by all means , buy or rent `` Gummo '' . It 's your call.Final Grade : F	-1
The problem with Gummo is that there is no motivation in any of the film . Characters move from one disturbing scene into another directionless and lost . The whole dead cat thing is moronic and obvious . Bunny Boy is token as if the director is saying `` Wow check it out -- I 've got a character who serves no purpose ! Is'nt that cool ! '' Likewise taking a bath in dirty water is also pointless even for a film with arthouse aspirations . On the flipside the casting of a bunch of no names does lend to some realism no matter how forced it actaully is and the fact that there is no real plot is n't actually it 's undoing -- like a bad accident the director seems to want us to watch just because it 's so insepid . In the right hands this may have worked .	-1
I was absolutely amazed my Keenen 's ability to construct a bomb in such a short amount of time . I guess the military taught him well . He made a bomb in his backpack in less than 30 seconds without opening the backpack . I may watch this movie again to figure out how to do that one . His parachuting concealing abilities are uncanny . Somehow he manages to hide the leg straps from everyone then they magically appear as he jumps off the building . As Keenen notes , & quot ; Sometimes he plans s -- - & quot ; . There exists one possible redeeming quality in this movie in random death/car accident scene . That scene gave the movie some hope , but it is terrible ...	-1
Atom Egoyan 's `` The Sweet Hereafter , '' is a film I wish I could like more . I had heard so many wonderful things about the film that I eagerly awaited my opportunity to view it for myself . Strangely enough , my local video store never bothered to stock it which looking back now might have been an omen of things to come . I finally did track down a copy to rent in due time and , I 'm sad to report , was left with a sense of disappointment when the film ended . `` The Sweet Hereafter '' opens with twin tragedies . In a small Canadian town , a school bus accident has occurred which has left 14 children dead . Miles away , a lawyer who would become involved in the bus accident receives a phone call from his estranged daughter . She tells him she is dying . The lawyer 's name is Mitchell Stephens ( Ian Holm ) and he tracks down the parents who lost children in the accident hoping to file a class action lawsuit against the bus company . Stephens is driven to represent the townspeople partly because that is what he does in life and partly to distract him from the situation with his daughter . The town becomes divided over whether to pursue the lawsuit . Eventually , everything comes down to the testimony of one of the accident 's survivors . Her name is Nicole ( Sarah Polley ) and what she says ensures that there will be no winners.Egoyan 's film is as much a commentary on survivor 's guilt as it is about the dark secrets a town can hold even though everything appears proper on the outside . It is a film about heartbreak and facades and how life can be so unfair . Yet , the film feels distant . While the various story arcs are well-defined and acted , I found it difficult to become immersed in the world I was watching . The film felt too muted and devoid of an emotional spark . While the hardships experienced by the characters in the film made for emotional drama , the film itself was less successful in generating strong emotional responses . The only instance where a truly-wrenching feeling swelled up in me was toward the end when the driver of the ill-fated bus is painfully reminded of the accident through a chance encounter.It may be that an Atom Egoyan film is an acquired taste that I unfortunately have not developed . Yet , I will give credit where credit is due by saying that Ian Holm and Sarah Polley should have received more recognition for their star turns . Watching Polly in particular makes one wonder why she is not currently being offered more high-profile work . Her performance here and in Doug Liman 's `` Go '' ( 1999 ) have been flawless . Here 's hoping that Hollywood will see fit to make more productive use of her talents .	-1
Yes , I loved the scenery , but the only thing & quot ; moving & quot ; in this film was the bus.Well , maybe I 'm being too harsh . I did like the interplay between Emma Thompson 's character and her mother -- to a point . The mother 's character really did become annoying ; if she 'd asked once more , & quot ; Are you going to Australia ? & quot ; I 'd have thrown a shoe at the television screen.The other stories were not as interesting : There 's Emma 's son , who invites a rather odd and sexually aggressive female in for a hot bath ( no really , just a bath ! ) , two little old ladies whose hobby is attending funerals , and two boys who are overly concerned with the development of their primary sexual attributes . I kept waiting for the next scene with Emma and her mother but . when it came , all they did was trudge along through the gorgeous scenery carping at each other.If you want an excellent film about mother/daughter relationships and mortality , rent & quot ; Terms of Endearment. & quot ; The scenery 's not as beautiful as this one , but the script 's a lot better .	-1
It 's not s bsd film with some good scenes , but I 'm getting somewhat tired of his egocentric self condemnation.The scene with Kristie Allen is really something though .	-1
I liked the first movie a lot so when the second one came out I went to see it , I jus have to say one word about it : CRAP.I have to admit the effects and the fighting scenes were not bad , but I think there was too much characters ( many of them appeared for seconds ) and the story went too fast , it seems like the producers saw that MK was going down in popularity so they decided to put three movies in one .	-1
Some people like Christopher Lambert and some do n't , but the cast assembled for the first MK was simply better than this one . The plot 's ridiculous in both , although the martial arts continues to remain pretty solid even if a bit over-dramaticized . But the second movie simply lacks the newness of the first and is a real let down . Portal closed . Nah , got reopened . Eh .	-1
This movie was not great cinema but it passed the time on a Saturday and was fairly inexpensive . It was entertaining .	-1
Being a big fan of the Mortal Kombat video game series and the first movie , I had mixed feelings when I heard Christopher Lambert would not be playing Rayden ( he was great ) . First off , I will say this , the acting is absolutely horrid ! ! ! The acting in the first movie was so-so , but the acting here is simply terrible , especially the actors portraying Motaro , Sheeva , Nightwolf , and Sonya . And what happened to Jax ? He went from a cool kind of guy to a token black guy who makes stupid wisecracks . Speaking of stupid wisecracks , James Remar as Rayden was a bad move , the only thing worse than his wisecracks are when he tries to be serious and philosophal about destiny . Shao Khan went from a fearsome enemy from the games to an overacting villian who ai n't so fearsome , and why did Johnny Cage have to be killed in the first 8 minutes ? Why oh why was this movie even made ? Oh well , I just hope they do n't make another Mortal kombat movie as bad as this steaming piece of garbage .	-1
This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made . I was a BIG fan of Mortal Kombat the game . I was an even bigger fan after I saw Mortal Kombat the movie ! I was SO excited when I heard they were making this movie . But after I saw it I did n't care if I ever played the game ever again . The first movie was perfect . I do n't know what they were thinking with this movie . At one point a mountain is supposed to blow up . It is SO obvious that it is just a small mound of dirt they built up and then blew up . Every single special effect used is horrible . To top that off is the horrible actors brought in . The first Rayden was perfect . This new Rayden is a joke . He even tells jokes . He tells one stupid joke after another . And then you have Jax . He 's pretty good when he has his metal arms . But in the end they are ripped off . You would think that would be cool except his real arms are underneath ! They were n't robot arms at all ! Just metal gloves ! Then you have Shao Kahn . Possibly the WORST part of the movie . He 's just some white guy . There 's nothing scary about him . He 's not huge and he 's not scary . He 's just a normal white guy . He looks NOTHING like he did in the first Mortal Kombat movie . This movie was a HUGE mistake . It hurt Midway badly . I heard they were making yet another Mortal Kombat movie . I 'll go see it if it does n't look like the junk this movie turned out to be .	-1
I remember seeing the first movie when it first came out in the theaters and actually enjoying it . The first movie 's ending really had us fans of the MK series wanting more since the first movie 's ending left us on a cliff-hanger with Shao Kahn coming to threatened the hero 's of the first movie.I remember reading about the sequel to the original Mortal Kombat in a movie magazine ( the Internet was only available to a select few , and I was n't one of them ) and I remember being excited because I am a fan of the video game series and the original movie kicked butt ... So when opening day came for Mortal Kombat : Annihilation , I went there opening day with my best friend at the time and since the movie theatre was packed , we had to stand for the ENTIRE movie ... .but we did n't mind because we thought that this movie was going to be as good as the original ... .once the opening sequence happened , it began to roll down-hill from there.Where do I start ? Well aside from using the original opening sequence from the first movie , we see that they have REPLACED most of the main characters with different actor 's and actresses ; Raiden is played by an actor who skipped puberty , Sonja Blade is replaced with a 40-something , and Johnny Cage is replaced with a look-alike . Rumor has it that the guy who played Johnny Cage told his agent that he wanted his character to be killed-off immediately because he did n't want to be apart of this bomb . Well , he got his wish . Johnny Cage is killed off immediately by Shao Kahn.The dialogue : It is VERY low-grade dialogue . The dialogue in this movie makes the first movie 's dialogue look like Citizen Kane compared to the sequel . Some of the lines are SO BAD they are kind of funny ... I mean , what were the writers of this movie trying to achieve ? Apparently they either did n't care about what the people would of thought , and they just decided to write something that would easily be consider a rough-draft script . To me , this is NOT the final draft of a script , this is EASILY a rough draft script.The fight-scenes : The fight scenes were actually pretty good in the first movie ... .with this ... .I do n't even know where to begin , so I guess it 's best to start from the beginning . Johnny Cage dies when he did his flying high-kick ( which the special effects look like they were done by a fourteen year old who is just learning how to add effects in Final Cut ) , and of course Mr. Cage dies . The fight scenes between a yellow robot and Sonja Blade is just BAD ; they are jumping around like they are in a jump house with laughable high kicks . Once the fight is over , the place blows up to the WORST green-screen explosion in the HISTORY of film . Now it 's Liu Kang 's time to fight , but wait ... who 's that ? It 's Scorpion ( who is coming back in this film ... but was n't he killed off in the first film ? ) and now he wants to fight Liu . But wait , Sub-Zero comes into the mix and fights Scorpion ( again , was n't Sub-Zero killed off in the first film also ? ) and now they duke it out to fight moves that would be laughed at a martial arts studio ... .It turns out that Scorpion is there to kidnap Katana , and Sub-Zero actually tells Liu Kang that he killed his brother ... .So , Sub-Zero had a brother that we did n't know about ? Hmmm ... .The characters : A lot of the characters are introduced , but are killed off rather quickly , and some characters are talked about but never given any screen time : Stryker and Kabal . As for the on-screen characters , talk about POOR acting and POOR direction . One of my favorite characters from the series Baraka is fighting Liu Kang , but his blades look like spray-painted cut-out cardboard ... again , he is killed off in like five minutes . Shiva is introduced , and again , has LESS than five minutes of a fight scene , and is killed . Most of the bad guys like Rain ( which is interesting because he did n't debut in the MK series TILL AFTER MK3 if my recollection serves me correctly ... . ) and again he has less than three lines of dialogue , and is killed by Shao Kahn . Wow , these characters are killed off quicker than innocent people in a teen horror flick.The final fight scene : Everyone has someone to fight ( except Raiden who is basically cheering the hero 's on from the side-lines ) ... Shao Kahn and Liu Kang fight and eventually they turn into claymation animals which looks SO AWFUL it looks like it was done by a 2nd grader with nothing to do over the weekend . Eventually , Liu Kang wins , and Shao Kahn turns into a box and the world is back to normal ... .The End ... Even before the credits started rolling , people were starting to throw popcorn and whatever they could get their hands on to throw at the screen ... we left as soon as people started throwing stuff which was after Shao Kahn turned into a box.Bottom Line : Ignore this movie like the plague , this movie takes awful to the next level . It should n't have been made , and it makes other video game movies look like masterpieces ... .Just stay away ... .	-1
Wow . I guess you had to have lived this time period to appreciate this movie because Boogie Nights bored me to death . I could n't wait for it to be over . Perhaps I 'm a product of my generation where great porn is easily accessible on-line 24/7 or perhaps I 'm just jaded altogether , but this movie was n't even campy to me ; it was just too long and too dull . Good performances by William H. Macy and Juliann Moore but that 's about it . The story is about a young guy who is supposedly `` gifted '' ( wtf ? ) who makes it big in the porn industry during the disco era . When a new recruit is added to the porn line-up , Dirk Diggler ( Mark Wahlberg ) gets jealous , loses it and gets fired , blah blah blah.The final shot mentioned by almost all the other reviewers is almost comical . The thought of deer sausage in intestinal casing crossed my mind . It might have been an erotic shot if Dirk Diggler 's `` gift '' had been alive instead of dead . And , I 've been fortunate to have been presented with much bigger `` gifts '' in my life , wink-wink , nudge-nudge.This movie is probably one for the old folks who lived the disco era . I do n't recommend it to anyone born after that time period because you 'll probably be bored like I was .	-1
I was looking at several Burt Reynolds movies , `` Hooper '' and `` Semi-Tough '' for a pair , and also the brilliant `` Deliverance '' in which he really shows his talent.The Amazon reviews for these films all referred to `` Boogie Nights '' which I had not seen , ( no agenda , here ) so I rented it . The reviews for BN , which are closing in on 300 , all seem to speak to the extraordinarily gifted ( I swear , no double entendre here ) plot , story line , and acting.WOW . Julianne Moore and Heather Graham really do look great unencumbered by all those silly clothes . I never noticed how great those actors were until they got naked . Especially doing some of this stuff on roller skates ! That 's acting ! So here 's my point.What 's the big deal ? I mean there are some 'Gone With the Wind ' 'Citizen Kane ' reviews out there . This is a movie about pornography , or if that 's too Republican a phrase for you , people who are filmed while having sex . Now , I 'm not about to use the adjective `` normal '' because that 's one of those words from where there is no safe return . It 's like those war movies where the heroes are told in the first few frames 'it 's a one-way mission . 'But I will add that while I venture back to my initial comment , it 's fun to look at naked women , golly , do n't you think it tends to debase women ? Do n't you think that while we are rationalizing the excesses of the 70 's we ought to consider that the explosion of porn might not have been something we want to laud ? Maybe , just maybe THE GUYS on the Supreme Court went just a little too far ? That a lot of these girls were just that , girls , under the age of 18 ? That even if they were just young , a lot of them were blitzed ? How about this ? In the days of the Pussycat theaters , do you think it meant anything that 99.5 % of the audience were men ? Gee . I must be missing something ( seriously ) . I mean I do n't like Reverand Pat . He 's an idiot . I do n't feel I have any moral high ground to speak from . I struggle along with everyone else . But I thought it was an incredibly stupid movie . I gave it 2 stars , yeah , because of Moore and Graham , because I 'm a real fan of Luis Guzman , and Macy and Cheadle are always great , and Burt , who keeps breaking my heart by making junk . 2 stars.There are some parts of the 70 's we collectively ought to forget . OK . I 'll accept Disco . But Porn ? No . I do n't believe we should censor it . Maybe we should stop trying to sell it , though . Larry Scantlebury	-1
Started off good , lost some steam in the middle and collapsed in a heap by the end . Perhaps this whole movie was an allegorical treatise representing an unsatisfying sexual encounter ? If that is the case , it is genius . Otherwise , it is really a long winding road to nowhere . This was a porn movie with no money shot . The appendage revelation was the only reason we watched it through to the end , and I have to say even the wife was disappointed . & # 34 ; Was that it ? & # 34 ; she muttered . Sadly , yes . That was it , that was the money shot - and it was n't worth much .	-1
This movie is not for me . I am not into low humor . I can not remember why I attempted to watch it . Because of one of the actors.It was just not for me . I got about half way through , and turned it off .	-1
it seems that all the boogie night dvds I exchange , the special subtitle features do not show while the movie is playing as advertised .	-1
John Wayne is Rocklin , who arrives in town , plays in a poker game that proves to be crooked , and goes to work for a ranch which , as it turns out , is run by a fiery young woman ( Ella Raines ) who inherited it when her mother died . Her step-father has been the businessman who acts like he 's running it , so there is the immediate conflict between step-daughter and step-father . Later we learn that there are several reasons for this hostility.Ward Bond plays a crook who is apparently a lawyer , and the local magistrate judge . This at a time when the `` real '' judges were circuit riders who only showed up every few months . He and the aunt of the girl who is supposed to inherit a ranch ( another one involved in the crooked land grab ) conspire to rob the girl of her inheritance , but Rocklin helps her . There are some mysterious reasons why , and he seems to be attracted to her as well as to Ella Raines , but in fact tells Gabby Hayes he steers clear of women because they are nothing but trouble . The point , I suppose , is that they just wo n't let him alone.If you do n't know that as a standard Wayne `` famous last words '' line , you have n't seen many Wayne westerns . So there are two pretty girls , both drawn to Wayne ( who is , after all , young and very macho ) , and I 'm not going to tell you how that comes out and spoil the fun.It 's not a bad movie , and Gabby Hayes is pretty funny , but it 's just another Wayne Western .	-1
this movie seemed endless , predictable , tired . By about the mid point I became convinced , it 's the perfect next project for MST3K . I love Arquette , Spaulding Grey , and Frances McDormand is the best , as always . The whole thing was just too contrived , over worked . Oy.Save yourself ( and 116 minutes ) for something a little more recent , leave this for the folks who saw it when it was new , and still feel sentimental about it .	-1
I had heard that `` Dark City '' would appeal to film noir buffs , to fans of thought-provoking science fiction , and to admirers of `` The Prisoner '' TV series . I fall into all of those categories , so this movie seemed like a sure thing.It was n't . Imagine a shaky hybrid of `` Blade Runner '' and `` The Matrix '' directed by the Coen brothers on an off day . Nothing matters here but special effects and flashy sets littered with zero-dimensional characters . Kiefer Sutherland 's wheezing doctor earns some sort of award as the most irritating character in recent memory . The thuddy , bass-heavy musical score underlines the `` Look at me I 'm so cool '' emptiness of the film.The sad part is that there were some really good ideas here . The central theme of the movie was an interesting twist on a `` Matrix '' -like concept , and in the hands of a director less obsessed with special effects , this could have been a fascinating and exciting movie . As it turned out , however , `` Dark City '' can only be recommended to fans of overlong comic books .	-1
one of the few movies that I do n't like . It is dark , makes no sense and I turned it off after 30 minutes . Maybe later on I will try to watch it again and I will like it but I doubt it .	-1
Going against the grain , I was disappointed by this film . It looked like a million bucks , had outstanding art direction , set design , and special effects . In that , there was vision . But the story is convoluted , and often has nothing coherent to keep it driving forward . Like it suffered from an identify crisis . I often felt like I was watching something impressive ( and expensive ) , but with nothing in the story to keep my curiosity going or my anticipation up I had a hard time keeping interest .	-1
We got the film because we really love Dustin Hoffman . The plot was amusing and interesting , but the end was a total downer . Watched it once and then took it to Bookman 's for a trade in .	-1
I was n't too into this movie . I did n't find Sandler as funny as he can be , the romantic aspect of it was trite , the characters were n't too realistic , and even the occasional funny reference to the fashion woe that was the eighties did n't save the film . I thought it was more cheese than anything else . However , the supporting actors that played the best friends of Sandler 's and Barrymore 's characters were pretty funny .	-1
..not my first choice for a romantic comedy . Adam Sandler acts in his movies ( that applies to Big Daddy too ) as if he 's Bruce Lee , who is afraid of no one , and could lift a mountain with one of his fingers . At least that 's what appears from his threatening tone when he speaks it ( and he does that a lot . ) Pros : *Some parts are very funny ( like Sandler 's version of Madonna 's & quot ; Holiday & quot ; ) .Cons : *Those parts are n't that much . *A lot of childish humor , especially near the end.Bottom line : kind of enetertaining , especially the first half , but gets too emotional and childish near the end .	-1
Along with the beach i have to say this is the worst movie i have ever seen . It is very boring , with a very simple story line that is dragged out , the parts that are supposed to be funny arent , and you have to force your self to laugh . I realy didnt like this movie i think its more for 20 + year olds at the youngest . It sadly was a disapointment	-1
What happened to this movie ? ! The special effects were convincing and even advanced and believable . But when it came to the plot , all we got was a hackneyed view of some metal space spiders out of Battlestar Galactica and a thoroughly unbelievable time-travel sequence , which was n't necessary in the first place . Talk about suspension of disbelief , this movie required the science of the impossible ! No reactor , no matter how powerful ( and this includes the Jupiter 5 main engine ) can be manipulated into producing space/time vortexes ! This would require something on the order of a black hole , not a puny spacecraft . How about a remake with a believable plot ?	-1
A trivia question . What movie knocked Titanic from it 's record number of weeks at No . 1 at the box office ? Lost In Space . Which is particularly amazing since it is one of the worst movies and waste of talent and celluloid every to ( dis ) grace a cineplex near you . While light years more sophisticated in terms of special effects than the original TV series on which the movie is based , it is a movie that is as convoluted and pathetically contrived as any in recent memory . While all movies require some degree of suspension of disbelief , this movie does not even have a reasonably coherent story line . And to have the talents of William Hurt , Mimi Rogers , Gary Oldman , and Heather Graham all combine into this mess of a movie is absolutely mind-boggling . This movie is constructed of every cliche imaginable . Characters are introduced in completely implausible ways just to have another character to market as an action figure . The movie ends with the possibility of sequels ... let 's hope those plans are Lost In Space .	-1
... It is without question the WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN ... The plot was dumb , the movie was too long , the special effects were n't very good , and the acting was atrocious . A cigar store indian could have added more depth to Matt LeBlanc 's role , Gary Oldham ( normally a wonderful actor ) seems to sleepwalk through his part . The script is so bad ... Nothing in this movie worked right on any level ...	-1
I do n't get this movie at all . People say it 's so great , but I 'm always like , `` what 's so great about it ? It 's like Stir Crazy , but without Gene Wilder . '' And , I 'm sorry , but Gene Wilder is great in that movie . Stir Crazy , that is -- not Shawshank Redemption , which he is not in.If you have n't seen Shawshank Redemption , do n't bother . Here 's the story : two criminals are in prison in the 1960s and they become friends while they 're in jail . The end . Sorry you just wasted your time and money , folks . Not to sound like a broken record , but does that sound like a better story than say this one : A married man is tempted by an alluring woman in red , and practically throws his life away as his obsession with her grows . That movie is called Woman in Red . Now , which one sounds more interesting to you ? Meanwhile , back in prison , the two gentleman played by Morgan Freeman ( Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves ) and Tim Robbins ( Cadillac Man ) plan to break out of jail , but their plans are doomed . That part starts to get interesting , until you realize that this is just another way that Hollywood glamorizes prison life and why should we be rooting for prisoners to break out of jail anyway ? If there were a movie about Jeffrey Dahmer and Charles Manson becoming friends and then they try to break out of prison , I would not be cheering them on . That 's what so hypocritical about the media , these days ! I wo n't ruin the ending where someone important is dead , but I will say that I have no idea why people get so involved in a movie like this that pales in comparison to , say , a movie with real action like `` The Rock '' or `` Silver Streak . `` If you see The Shawshank Redemption , just remember that it is going to be a disappointment and you 'll probably feel depressed about your life for weeks to come .	-1
I have been hearing great things about this 'classic '' movie since it came out in 1994 , but only saw it for the first time recently . Even the librarian who checked it out for me vouched for it in the strongest terms ( women especially seem to love this movie , for some reason ) . I found it to be mildly engaging , but formulaic , saccharine , surprisingly vulgar , and painfully cliched . I will never watch it again . For a truly great prison movie , watch `` Cool Hand Luke '' .	-1
This was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be . The biggest disappointment for me were the main players . Few of them really looked like the historical persona . Lincoln 's portrayal was a letdown from the start . Although he looked fairly close , his voice was all wrong . Lincoln had a squeaky voice with a real Kentucky twang . ( This comes from observations by Lincoln 's law partner , Herndon as well as Nicolaye & amp ; Haye , Lincoln 's secretaries and biographers ) Hal Holbrook actually came closest to the right pitch and tone . Even more annoying was the portrayal of Sec . of War Edward Stanton . Here , he comes across like a frustrated grandfather . The real Stanton was NOT a Lincoln fan , he once refered to Lincoln as the & quot ; original baboon & quot ; and constantly challenged the 16th president on issue after issue . Lincoln would let Stanton have his temper tantrums , but managed to & quot ; put his foot down & quot ; at the right time . Stanton himself was far from well liked by other members of the cabinet and was actually feared and loathed by many . First Lady Mary Todd was far too slender and attractive in this depiction . If you 've ever seen photos of the real Mary , she looked dowdy if not downright frumpy . Her rages were legendary in Washington . She once chased a deliveryman down the street with a broomstick . Secretary Seward called her a & quot ; she-wolf & quot ; and others dubbed her a bit** . A surprise for me was the portrayal of Dr. Charles A. Leale , the 27 year old Army surgeon who took charge of Lincoln after the shooting . The actor bore more than striking resemblance . It was almost spooky to watch . Jim Bishop 's book was followed closely which was one of the more appealing parts of this film . Even snippets of dialog from the book crept in with regularity .	-1
with leslie nielsen and mel brooks i figured this was a for sure hit . i would say this was one of their weaker efforts . you will not feel you wasted your time but i felt it was not nearly as funny as its potential .	-1
Well - I purchased this dvd and it turns out that its the wrong region - Bummed ! It 's a pity because it 's a worthy title to go into my Mel Brooks section .	-1
This movie is so NOT my cup of tea - too stupid to be funny . However , I do have friends that think this type of humor is hilarious , so if you loved Leslie in Airplane you 'll probably love him in this . And for the men , there are plenty of ample bosoms in this for you as an added bonus .	-1
dont even bother , unless you 're just in it for the fashion and score ( some nice techno sounds ) .	-1
I bought the Trilogy Box Set ( from Amazon.com ) , not realizing they were Canadian releases ( only ) ... .. and if you 're familiar with Blu-Ray Releases ... anything released in Canada ( but not yet in the US ) , comes with absolutely NO Bonus Features ( not even the ones contained on the regular DVD ) . Audio options are limited & generally the best you get is 5.1 Dolby or DTS and so on.If you want the specs on the Blade blu-rays ( all 3 ) , read my review of the Trilogy Box Set ... as they 're the same as those included in that set . ( below my 'name ' , click on `` read my other reviews '' ... the Trilogy review be on the 1st page toward the top ) PS : Other Blu-Ray ( Canadian only ) releases you should know about ( since Amazon does n't tell you ) : Seven ( Se7en ) , Thirteen Ghosts , From Dusk 'Til Dawn , and others that escape me at the present time . Some I 'm not sure about ; but am pretty sure are the same way : At any rate , just be patient ... a US release will come within a year . Until then , Blade 1 , 2 & 3 , all look just fine through `` HD/1080p Upscaling '' ( by viewing on upscaling dvd player , or on PS3 , etc . ) .	-1
The movie is the incorrect aspect ratio and it 's distracting . Sadly that is n't the only video issue . The picture quality if horrible almost as if the movie was n't only cropped , but also stretched . No special features . The movie itself is awesome . Great action and effects that mostly hold up to today 's standards . I recommend the movie itself , but be sure to buy the American version . ( It was available when I ordered . I wish I had waited . )	-1
`` Blade '' , the adaptation of the graphic comic about the world 's most badass vampire slayer , manages to be both bloodless and brainless at the same time . I 've sat through this flick several times wondering what the producers thought they were looking at when they put it together . In the flick , Wesley Snipes plays `` Blade '' a sort of hybrid between vampire ( he calls them `` sucker heads '' ) and human - born when his mother is violated by the evil vampire Deacon Frost ( Stephen Dorf ) . As you can imagine , Blade is n't very keen on vampires , and he goes through this flick annihilating them in gross using machine gun and samurai sword . While the vampires are all evil , most are just rich guys in suits with nothing more against the human race than merely being on top of us on the food chain , going about their un-dead lives conquering the financial and political world when they 're not going for somebody 's jugular . Frost has his own plans , but they require getting his hands on a few pints of Blade 's blood . Seems that being a half-breed vampire has more of an upside than you 'd think - with Blade being able to walk under the sun that kills other vampires . ( Crosses and other religious stuff are harmless against vampires - that 's just superstition ; garlic , wooden stakes , silver and sunlight , however , remain as lethal as we 'd been led to believe ) Blade 's blood is the key to elevating the race of vampires above its weaknesses , raising them to be gods.Not entirely an original plot , but `` Blade '' could have worked . The action sequences could have worked , but they 're unintelligible beyond seeing Blade dance around while dispatching scores of vampire soldiers . Though the flick takes its cue from HK action movies , they lack the poetry of `` Crouching Tiger '' `` The Matrix '' or even `` Charlie 's Angels '' . There 's no irony , just flying feet and a samurai sword with a self-adjusting handle that somehow manages to save the day . The special effects are n't anything special either - just expensive CGI and obvious CGI at that . For a movie about vampires , computer animated blood is just no substitute . The flick tosses in a mysterious serum that turns vampires into bombs , but that 's just more CGI . The problem is that Wesly Snipes could have saved this flick but , with his sunglasses he 's something of an undead character himself , and he spends more time on those killer moves than on making Blade anything more than some killer android in Ray Bans .	-1
Chan is good ; Chris Tucker is more than a little irritating . I do n't think he 's done much of anything since this came out in 1998 . I can see why .	-1
Good action move ... fast moving and lots of things going on.. alwayslike Jackie Chan ... . he keeps it moving.along fun	-1
I like Jada Pinkett-Smith as an actress , but this movie is really bad . We 've seen this kind of film done to death ... nothing about it is original . The movie stinks and I mean it . If you want to see Jada in a GOOD movie , check out SET IT OFF or BAMBOOZLED ... do n't waste your time on this trash .	-1
Like others I was beguiled into buying the DVD after hearing the CD of the marvelous one-man show that Stewart has done . I found this to be a less than compelling re-make of the timeless classic.The enduring story of `` A Christmas Carol '' involves Ebenezer Scrooge , a greedy grasping businessman , who is untouched by human emotion . Or so we think until he is visited one Christmas Eve by four sprits who show him the error of his ways . In the end a redeemed Scrooge resolves to keep the Christmas spirit all the days of his life and to be good to his fellow men.In contrast to his one-man show , Stewart is here keeping company with actors of lesser abilities . This is a dreadful problem . Especially since so many of the characters are only thinly drawn in Dicken 's story . The Fianc & eacute ; e who leaves him and the sister who once rescued him are both poorly portrayed in this rendition . Even the beloved clerk , Crachit , is a weak shadow of the loving family man we have come to expect . Stewart himself seems to be giving a less than peak performance but this might just be because he was unable to rise above the mediocre acting about him.I did not find that the special effects were in anyway well done . All the advent of technology and computer-aided imaging was unable to create anything that could captive the viewer and cause him to suspend disbelief.I purchased the DVD edition of this movie , but I might as well have saved my money and gotten the VHS version ( or saved more money and not gotten any version ) . The special features are noting more than the little ` squibs ' used by TNT to promote the film none lasts for more than a minute or two.But do not despair if you simply must have Stewart as Scrooge , get a copy of his one-man show . It is really magnificent .	-1
I think Patrick Stewart is a terrific actor however , I did n't care for him in the roll of Ebenezer Scrooge . A real disappointment . Donated it to the local public library .	-1
I am truly amazed at the great reviews this video received . I am a great fan of a Christmas Carol and watch the 1951 and 1984 version every year -- several times ! I was sure that a version starring Patrick Stewart had to be fantastic . Well , this is the poorest version I 've seen . Stewart , who is a great actor , puts very little into this role . In fact , his English accent appears to have taken leave of him . All of the acting in this version is very mediocre , and the & quot ; modernized & quot ; language just does n't work . If you want to modernize the language , then move it forward to the 20th century . Tiny Tim appears in just one brief scene , and you never get any sort of feel for him -- -and the closeness between him and his father . He is also very healthy looking -- in fact , he looks like an ordinary child who injured his leg and needs a crutch to walk . So when Scrooge asks the spirit , if this seemingly healthy child will live , it seems almost comical.Several of the most powerful scenes were also watered down -- in particular , when the ghost of Christmas present ( who was so lifeless and dull , and not a giant like he 's supposed to be ) opens his robe to show Ignorance and Want . In the other versions , I still feel jolted when he opens his robe , even though I 've seen it so many times . In this version , it was so blah.The special effects add nothing to it , and in fact , make it rather hokey . Especially the spirit of Christmas future -- with those glowing eyes , it looks like something that Captain Picard would have met on the Enterprise ( maybe Stewart got confused what century he 's in ) .Anyway , I do not plan on adding this version to my Christmas Carol repetoire . If you want to see a modernized version , I suggest you see the delightful & quot ; Scrooged & quot ; with Bill Murray . But if you want to see something that Dickens had anything to do with , I suggest the 1951 or 1984 versions , both of which are great . Several people have claimed that this version is the only one that follows Dickens work scene for scene -- well , what 's the point if the acting is so plastic and emotionless and the speech has been transformed to modern day American slang ?	-1
This is an excellent version of the famous Dickens story . Patrick Stewart is an excellent Scrooge , and the made for television story is very , very good.The digital print from Amazon in this case is very disappointing . The version listed here has Spanish subtitles which are extremely distracting . I would highly recommend avoiding the digital version unless you intend to watch this with Spanish speaking friends .	-1
I dont know why they made this pile but it stunk beans . only the story with Glenn Quinn and the headless girl saved this one from being a total shame , because Glenn Quinn rocks and may he rest in peace	-1
sorry but as a fan of mr allens work i thought this was just barely a semi documentary but knowing the film crew is there i didnt really feel like it was an informal account of woody . soon yi who is like what 45 yrs his junior ? acts like she is the 'star ' and she is the 'intellect ' and woodys 'protector ' and always trying to b witty but i kept thinking 'if you werent one of his ex 's youngest children you wouldnt even be around ' . she holds him tightly when the mere ripple of a passing boat goes by and woody is 'shaken ' and she calms him 'oh here comes a wave ' then 'oh its ok it was a tiny one ' or something to that effect . i cant imagine a grown man acting like he is as feeble and shy and helpless as he does in this film . soon yi and the other lady ( didnt even care to find out who she was , maybe his sister ? ) would tell him that he had to talk to his mom n dad and they stand around watching woody and the sister acts like its such a burden ( rolling eyes and huffing ) to chat to her mother ? soon yi comes across as spoiled ( 'they forgot my toast ! ' or 'cant they get someone to fix it ! when the 'queen soon yi ' has the whole floor of a hotel but cant find hot water , oh my ) take her out of the pic and i would have liked it more . the music is so light weight that if woody 's name wasnt attached these guys n one lady wouldnt have a single person there at the concert halls . all n all i will stick to the recent documentary on his life than this comic book account of soon yi and woody in the 'real world ' as there just isnt much here and i wish they focused on woody instead of showing how much in love soon yi is with woody and give me more music or interviews with his parents or friends or anything instead of the rags to riches story of soonyi	-1
Do n't get me wrong ! I sincerely think that the subject of AMERICAN HISTORY X is one of the most important matter to discuss nowadays . I can not stand the arguments of any extremist political or social groups , leftist or ultra-conservative . But we 're here to give an opinion about a movie and not to have a philosophical meeting about morals . So , in my humble opinion , AMERICAN HISTORY X is a very poor movie with a great subject and outstanding actors.The script of AMERICAN HISTORY X is a collection of clich & eacute ; s one can find in thousands of Hollywood movies since the thirties . Just imagine , in the character played by Edward -DEREK- Norton , James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart . After having spent three years in jail , Bogie comes back home and realizes his younger brother has become a potential public danger . With the help of his parole officer , he 'll try to save him from the streets . Or imagine Gary Cooper , a former hitman , coming back home only to discover that his son , let 's say - Montgomery Clift - , is the fastest gunman of the town . Will he be able to convince Monty that duels are a no-future occupation ? Good subjects do n't necessarily make good movies specially if there 's only a yes man to direct . So , if you want to study the evolution of the right-wing neo-nazis groups in today America , it would be a good idea to see a few documentaries on the subject , and there are pretty good ones to be seen , rather than to buy AMERICAN HISTORY X.A pretentious DVD .	-1
Apparently , I am one of the few who did n't think this movie was a work of pure genius , or even muddled genius . While Edward Norton 's performance is worth watching , he can only do so much with the dialog he 's given and the formulaic change-of-heart plot . Bad Ed seethes with free-floating hatred and takes off his shirt a lot , exposing a torso in an advanced state of Nazi buffitude ; Good Ed keeps his orange prison jumpsuit zipped and acts like Gandhi wearing a `` kick me '' sign . Ed Furlong is , as usual , excellent as a troubled young man with adorably floppy hair.The message of this movie seems to be , `` Racism is bad , but ... '' with the `` but '' semi-legitimizing a thin thread of White Right whining . Prior to watching this movie , I was of the opinion that most citizens of the USA had given some thought to ideas about race and `` fairness '' and the murky area where these concepts intersect . So how to explain , then , why so many reviewers have been `` blown away '' by this simplistic , patronizing piece of [ junk ] posing as a serious look at a serious issue ? I do n't feel any different about racist behavior than I did prior to viewing this film ; I am completely creeped out by how many people seem to have needed this stupid film as an impetus to change their thinking .	-1
`` American History X '' was very predictable from the first scene . There are several gang fights throughout with Blacks , Mexicans and Skinheads spewing raging rants on hate . It comes across as simplistic and somehow disingenuous story of a California neo-Nazi ( Edward Norton ) . He is tough because he has to be - Gangs are taking over the neighborhood so he becomes the alpha dog of his white-skinned pack . Everyone wants to be tough , including his little brother , and it gets tiring to watch.Norton 's character kills three Blacks caught robbing his car one night and is sent to prison for three years . He comes out a reformed man who has seen the futility of crime , killing and fighting . He wants to atone for his sins and save his younger brother before it is too late . The drama is overwrought and the movie becomes predictable as we see another neighborhood crisis cause needless killings and pain . `` American History X '' is borderline bad , the script is just pathetic . Edward Norton does his best to hold this sad , tired story together .	-1
This could be an adventurous movie for grade school children to watch if there was not swearing in it . It is definitely to unbelievable for an adult to watch without a raised eyebrow throughout . I will not state specifics just in case someone & # 34 ; seriously & # 34 ; wants to watch it .	-1
I love John Waters work . He always brings you something totally original , shocking , funny. & # 34 ; Pecker & # 34 ; is his weakest work . The characters were all losers , irritating , nothing amusing about them and the device of having the main character , Pecker ( Edward Furlong ) relentlessly clicking his camera made me want to scream.The characters were just not over-the-top like those you find in & # 34 ; Cry Baby & # 34 ; and of course , & # 34 ; Pink Flamingos. & # 34 ; The only scene that was fun was the nearly naked go-go boys . There should have been much more of them to jazz things up .	-1
& lt ; strong > subUrbia & lt ; /strong > ( Richard Linklater , 1996 ) I should start off by saying I am not a Richard Linklater fan in any way , shape , or form . ( In fact , sticking him in a gibbet and allowing the crowd to pelt him with various lethal instruments for being the man who inspired Kevin Smith to direct would not be out of bounds . ) When I found & lt ; em > subUrbia & lt ; /em > on Netflix Instant , I added it to my queue without checking details , assuming it was the 1983 Penelope Spheeris movie of the same name . When I discovered upon further investigation that it was Linklater , I almost dumped it . But it contains two of my favorite nineties actors , Giovanni Ribisi and Nicky Katt , so I decided to give it a go anyway . Silly me.Based on a play by Eric Bogosian , & lt ; em > subUrbia & lt ; /em > tells the non-story of a group of twentysomethings -- one can not by any reasonable stretch of the imagination call them `` friends '' -- who spend much of their time hanging out beside a generic quickie-mart run , of course , by an Indian immigrant ( & lt ; em > Requiem for a Dream & lt ; /em > 's Ajay Naidu ) . There is some hope that things may get interesting for these worthless drunks when Pony ( & lt ; em > Spider-Man & lt ; /em > 's Jayce Bartok ) , a classmate of theirs who 's now the frontman for an arena-rock band , comes back to town for a night and decides to spend it hanging out with them . While the story does have an arc , in that the lives of some of the characters do change during the narrative , here 's a spoiler for you : it never does get interesting.What & lt ; em > is & lt ; /em > interesting : almost every positive review I have seen for this pointless , worthless waste of celluloid talks about how `` truthful '' it is , how `` real '' it is , how `` close to [ my ] experience '' it is . As someone who spent my twenties drunk , let me state , for the record , that this movie is not any of those things in any sort of universal sense . If I 'd had this pathetic a life in my twenties , I 'm not sure I 'd have ever made it to thirty . There is no sense of hope for these characters , even those who got out previously , or who get the chance to get out in the course of the film . There is no joy whatsoever to be had here . This is the kind of stuff Sartre would have written had he been suicidally depressed , perhaps , except that Sartre had a finely-tuned sense of desperation , whereas Bogosian 's script ( to which , I must say , Linklater 's directorial `` skills '' are almost uniquely suited ; there 's not a shred of evidence that Linklater thinks about the composition of a single shot in this film ) has desperation that looks more like a couple of tomatoes that were splattered against a wall by an overly-aggressive nine-year-old trying to work out his personal issues.Relentlessly , pointlessly , utterly dull , with hateful characters . Worthless .	-1
I was greatly looking forward to the blu-ray disc of the original KING KONGsince Warner Bros. Home Video had done superb blu-ray discs of other classicfilms . But talk about how too much anticipation can lead to a disappointingviewing experience.Part of the problem is is that no original camera negatives exist for manyclassics from the often pined for `` Golden Age Of Hollywood '' KING KONG beingone of many such films . Its still a highly enjoyable film and the visualeffects are amazing for 1933 but and this is a big BUT . with all of theadvanced digital technology available today and considering Warner Bros.Home Video 's A+ track record with their previous blu-ray discs of classicfilms the picture image of the KK blu-ray disc should have been much crisperand sharper etc ... than it is . it is *barely* better than the special editionrestored dvd of KK that WBH Video released Dec. of 2005.Since no original camera negatives exist for the 1933 KK WBH Video should havedone a complete and i mean a ***COMPLETE*** restoration/remastering etc ... ofwhatever print of the film they used . Again the most disappointing blu-raydisc i have yet come across .	-1
You 'll love this . I sat in amazement and watched about one-half of this rambling mess about people who were so vulgar and pointless that I could not understand why major stars agreed to do this . When Chazz Palminteri smashes his head into Anna Paquin 's forehead , I lost it.If you enjoy watching a `` movie '' about people who have diarrhea of the mouth and spend their pointless lives snorting coke , screwing , bitching , complaining , snorting more coke , talking about drugs and bitches , snorting more coke and commenting about every single thing they 've just said , you 'll have a grand old time . If you want to be entertained , moved , enlightened or challenged , you 'd be better off sitting in a lotus position and chanting your own mantra .	-1
When David Rabe 's play `` Hurlyburly '' opened on Broadway in August 1984 , it was directed by Mike Nichols . It ran for 343 performances -- a long Broadway run -- and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play . William Hurt was nominated for Best Actor in his role as Eddie . Judith Ivey who recently appeared in the Clint Eastwood film `` Flags of our Fathers '' won the Tony as Featured Actress in a play . The rest of the cast included Harvey Keitel as Phil , Cynthia Nixon as Donna , Ron Silver as Mickey , Jerry Stiller as Artie and Sigorney Weaver as Darlene . It 's easy to see why a producer would want to bring this to the screen.With lead actors Sean Penn , Kevin Spacey & Anna Paquin , there are four Oscars to make this an award-winning cast . Perhaps there is a great difference from a Mike Nichols production that would bring out the ironies and balance it with comedy to this film Director Anthony Drazen who won the filmmaker 's trophy @ Sundance for `` Dramatic Zebrahead . '' Whatever the reason , the film quickly become tedious and the down-spirals into a valueless void.It is hard to deny that Sean Penn is one of the most brilliant screen actors working today . He won the Best Actor Award for this picture @ the Venice Film Festival . As Eddie , he snorts cocaine like a chain smoker , snarls , cries & puts his hand in his pants . Watching the actor bounce between highs and lows must be a qualitatively quite difference performance that William Hurt 's on Broadway . Penn is worth watching . He 's brilliant and makes the film worth a second star.Kevin Spacey as the manipulative Mickey is hardly endearing . Yes , compared the other guys he seems relatively together . But his separation from his wife and family are hardly touched upon in the screenplay . It leaves Spacey with a mono-level performance that , while interesting , does not move us because he does n't change.Chazz Palminteri as the gorilla-minded Neanderthal Phil that ca n't control himself around women is utterly obnoxious . It 's unclear why Eddie keeps him around . Perhaps to feel that he 's better than someone else , as the dialogue indicates . But we do n't really get that emotional need . Thus when Phil drives off Mulholland , we 're really just glad to be rid of him.I agree that the women are the most likeable . However , we fail to understand why they hang around these guys . Robin Wright Penn 's Darlene seems too bright & together to connect with Eddie . As the waif Donna , Anna Paquin almost made me forget her Rogue character from the X-Men movies . She is so vulnerable that I felt sorry for her . As Bonnie , Meg Ryan takes the role that won Ivey the Tony , but we fail to understand why she is loose . She does n't seem like a girl who 'd have such low standards . The fact that she walks out on Eddie seems to confirm this.Screenwriter David Rabe had worked with Penn in two other films , `` State of Grace '' & `` Casualties of War . '' While Penn comes off the best , the overall effect of the story is that these are successful people who live in the Hollywood hills , but who have no moral compass and are profoundly unhappy . It was a chore to make myself sit through the entire film . I could only do it late at night after my wife had gone to bed , because she wanted nothing to do with it after the first 10 minutes . So while this project may have been wonderful on Broadway , the film version nose-dived into oblivion . Taxi !	-1
a total waste of time . not recommended . thank god for the fast forward feature . it was obvious from the beginning this would be a disaster and it was .	-1
Let me start off by saying that when this movie was made I was 16 years old and watching WCW on a regular basis every night it was on except for usually Monday 's because I had gymnastics practice ( even though I always caught the end of Monday Night Nitro from around 9:30-10:00 ) . I 've seen 3 documentaries on the nWo , this one , Revolution , and nWo Back In Black . Although none of them were that great , this one was the worst . All it really seems to do is tell the story of the nWo in a bunch of WCW match high lights . Plus lots of things I remember about the nWo wolf pack , such as Disco Inferno trying to join ( man was that ever funny ) and DDP turning them down were left out . Other things worthy of mention being left out of this filmEric Bischoff losing his position as WCW commissioner to Ric Flair in a matchA few other feud 's nWo had with the horsemenBam Bam Bigalo 's problems with the nWo Wolf Pac ( which tied in with Disco Inferno ) The LWOFeud 's with the Dungeon of DoomnWo black and white 's referee that everyone aside from nWo black and white members hated ( I remember when the nWo wolf pack ducked taped that referee up ) The Cat Ernest Miller 's beef with Scott NortonIf you want to see a good documentary film on the WCW , I would reccomend seeing the film titled & # 34 ; The Rise And Fall of WCW & # 34 ;	-1
The original M & M ; Smith ( 1941 ) . In its own way , just as whacky as the recent Pitt/Jolie vehicle . But the similarities end there . Hitchcock 's version is basically silly and not especially funny ( he may have been a master of suspense , but not comedy ) , and headlines a slightly chubby Carol Lombard ( Hitchcock 's landlord who urged him to make the film -- apparently against his better judgment ) . Robert Montgomery ( not the Director 's first choice ) is the less-than-better half who seems over his acting head most of the time ( especially compared to screwball-comedy veteran Lombard 's performance ) .Outdoor soundstage sets look just plain phony while indoor sets look just plain cheap ( and phony ) . Very distracting . Without Lombard , the film would have gone straight to DV ... err , the drive-ins.WILLIAM FLANIGAN , Ph.D .	-1
Maybe it is just the genre but I tried to watch this the other day and just lost interest.I could never quite figure out why anyone gave Cary Grants character so many free passes , nor why the wife character was so foolish to marry someone she did not know in the first place.Maybe it was the British high society aspect of it that turned me off . It just did not do anything at all for me , so after watching an hour or so of it , I just turned it off and deleted it from the DVR .	-1
It started off well enough . . . the geeky beautiful girl who was tempted by a guy ( I would say good looking but Grant appeared very tired and kinda aged in this movie even though he was also looking young [ not so puffy of a face ] ) to awaken her quest to find a relationship . But then . . .well it just turned into a soap opera . . . the day time soap opera type of nonsense . And from that point I just spared myself the senseless emotional manipulation by turning it off .	-1
I am not sure where all the glowing reviews are coming from , did these people watch this thing ? The on-again off-again `` Fargo '' rip-off accents warned me early this was going to be painful . Other huge negatives : lack of a plot , anorexia humor , it all does n't add up . This movie seems to be going for the small-town , offbeat mocumentary ambience of truly funny films like `` Waiting for Guffman '' , but fails miserably , there are simply no characters to like and there is none of Christopher Guest 's subtlety whatsoever anywhere . Kirstie Alley is more over-the-top here than in her Pier One commercials . Kirsten Dunst does her one-note goody two-shoes stuck with bad people routine . About the only bright spot in this whole mess was Allison Janney , playing against type as a helmet-head trailer trash neighbor . Wow , folks , this is B-A-D .	-1
Ive always been into black comedies about stupid American beauty queens getting homicidal , but this was a bit of a disappointment . Id really give it 2 1/2 stars , not just two , but you know how it is.It certainly had some good laughs , and heaps of parts where you just cringe and go & quot ; Oh my God , how sick. & quot ; Denise Richards was hilariously sickening , dancing with a stuffed Jesus , and I found it funny when all the Beauty Queens were throwing up ( I dunno ! It just kinda puts a quirky spin on the whole idea of beauty pageants ! ) So it was all right , but I couldve done better ( ha ha ! )	-1
This movie had to be secretly directed by Bill Gates . Gates is portrayed as inteligent , kind , resourceful , hardworking , a business genius , and even wild and crazy . Jobs on the otherhand is given no redeeming qualities what-so-ever ( Darth Vader school of personel management ) . I 'm not saying Gates is n't intelligent -- he 's certainly been successful , but this film is so completely one sided that it ruins what might have been an above average TV movie .	-1
The only real good thing about the movie was it 's well-cast characters , good performances , and the sex ( which you can find more intriguing in Basic Instinct ) . Otherwise it contains extremely unappealing character ( especially Skerrit , who starts to make love to Ivy even when he knows his daughter 's in the hospital and even when his wife is dead ; I wished Gilbert would have pushed him out the window ) and silliness sink it deeply . Not much plot as well , with the familiar who's-sleeping-with-who melodrama . Ther is some character development , but it 's also mean-spirited .	-1
After reading many reviews I thought that I will be seeing a movie similar or even better to the Poison Ivy - The New Seduction ! MAJOR disappointment ! ! ! ! ! The story Is interesting and on the paired but the body shots that make Poison Ivy - The New Seduction a great movie are completely missing.So if you want to see Drew Barrymore in her true beauty then this is not the movie.Poison Ivy - The New Seduction	-1
What a disgusting stupid movie . I saw this when i was just a kid . and news flash drew barrymore doesnt look like that anymore . Not trying to be rude , but what the hell is wrong with that girls chin ? It grew over the years , because she looked fine in bad girls this movie , and i think boys on the side , but movies like never been kissed , and at the end of charlie 's angels full throttle , all you can see when you look at her face is that huge white chin , like a jay leno chin . reminds me of the moon man from mcdonalds ... with the huge chin that sticks way out . it 's a cruel fact of what time does to our looks , when you get older you arent as pretty as you use to be , but i never thought chins grew bigger , in her early years her chin was of normal size now it looks huge and deformed . AS for this movie , not sexy at all , unless you find a backstabbing , murdering , lying , crazy ass teenage girl ... .. sexy ? Maybe men would like it , because all it has is sex scenes . only for shallow people who get excited when it comes to `` that fantasy '' of a much older man having sex with a teenage girl , and he 's old enough to be her father . I dont find it sexy at all , it just was n't believable in any way shape or form . A complete waste of time , money , and talent . Flat out garbage . thumbs down .	-1
Poison Ivy II is one of three films that were made forming a very loose trilogy . It is not necessary to see any of the movies to enjoy one of the others . This entry follows Lily ( Alyssa Milano ) after she has moved to LA to attend art school . She finds Ivy 's diary ( from the first movie ) and is inspired to let herself be more uninhibited . She picks up a boyfriend on one hand and is pursued by her art teacher on the other.I have nothing against soft-core movies and every now and then I see one that is actually not bad . Unfortunately , Poison Ivy II is not one of those movies . The story drags so badly that you 'd swear it 's stretched over at least 4 hours and it generally feels as slow and constipated as any film you 're ever likely to suffer through . If there was some genuine heat on the screen when the movie tries to be sexy , you might forgive this . Alas , the sex is just as ponderous and devoid of appeal as the rest of Poison Ivy II . Alyssa Milano looks like she wants to be somewhere else every time she reveals even a little bit of skin and there is never a sense of true passion when she 's with either her boyfriend or her art teacher.All in all , this movie is a stinker . It 's dull , pointless , and not even a little sexy . Whether you want an interesting story or an erotic romp you 'll want to look elsewhere for you entertainment .	-1
Alyssa Milano is one of my favourite actresses , after seeing all seasons of Charmed . She 's a natural . So you can pretty much guess why I bought Poison Ivy 2.You know most of the story from the original movie , and Alyssa basically does nothing apart from look pretty - even in a pair of DUNGAREES she still looks gorgeous . I got a phonecall about 20 minutes in , which made me seriously consider switching it off and watching something else , but I was determined to at least give it a chance . Wish I 'd stayed on the phone now ! There 's not much depth in the first 40+ minutes of the movie . It 's setting up for anyone who has n't seen the first movie , not that it 's repeating the first , but it is incredibly boring . The very , very , very , very , first scene ( did I make it clear it was the first scene ? ) , Alyssa appears partially topless and does n't seem to wear any underwear throughout the rest of the movie.Basically she moves to a new city after having an illicit relationship with what appears to be her teacher , and is instantly attracted to her male sculptor ( think Jason Smith from Sex & The City , and those Absolut Vodka adverts ) , but is also semi-attracted to her art teacher , who is a total sleaze . She ends up babysitting for her art teacher 's daughter ( Camilla Belle from Practical Magic ) and one thing leads to another . You know the rest.There 's a happy ending tacked onto the end of this , after a pretty shocking incident ( which I did not see coming ) but it seems worthless after you 've sat through the first half of the movie . What should have been done , would have been to scrap the first half and redo it all over . Would have been a better movie for it , because even though the second half is good , it does n't make up for sitting through the first half . Pretty much watch for Alyssa Milano only . Otherwise steer well clear .	-1
this film is a bad joke.who can act in this film ? Ice Cube is himself.nothing new here.Elizabeth Hurley is very bland.also due to Hollywoods Racial hangups what happen to the sparks between Cube & amp ; Hurley ? not a very believable film in any way.one of those 3 : am films at best .	-1
The story makes no sense.Acting is horrible by everyone - or , the plot and dialogue just suck so badly that no one could cure it . Having an all star cast raised expectations , then cruelly dashed them.Worst part is that the scenery is not identifiably Minnesota . Even the title raises hopes , only to disappoint.Hopeless American flabby drivel . Sad to see how far Tuesday Weld , Cameron Diaz , and Keanu Reaves had fallen to have to do crap like this for money .	-1
To begin , House Party 2 is no House Party . In fact , those that would like to compare the two are completely off their hypothetical film `` rocker '' . These are two completely separate films . Do you know why ? What originally began as a film about some soulful and youthful teens trying to get to the ultimate dance party has now transformed into this clich & eacute ; morality tale that demonstrates the power of friendship and the strength of humility . WHAT ! Is that why I wanted to watch this film ? I apologize , but one of the few reasons that I liked House Party was because they followed the K.I.S.S . method ( for those unfamiliar it is the Keep It Simple Stupid method ) of filmmaking . In the original , becoming a lyricist , a ladies man , and having the best party in town was the root of the film . While there was a romantic side to the story , it fell second nature to the growing hip-hop scene . It was a dance film first , developed character story second . Honestly , that is what I enjoyed about the film . While I did n't think House Party was the greatest release of the century , it did have this genuine feel about it . In fact , after watching this poorly crafted sequel , I have a bit more respect for the original . Where was the dancing ? Where was the creativity ? Where was the same Kid & Play that I remembered from the first House Party ? They were nowhere to be found in this trashy sequel.Robin Harris . We all remember him as `` Pop '' from the original film , but what we do not realize about this humorous comedian is that he subsequently changed the image of the House Party series . In the original , he was this father trying to steer his son into a path of academia instead of rap and parties , in the sequel , he plays a spirit who annoyingly hounds Kid throughout the film with flashbacks from the original . Due to his death , he brings nothing new to the table , yet this entire sequel seems to be focused around those few short words that he used in the first film . I do n't mean to be rude , but I never felt that the father was such a big element in the original . I thought that Kid trying to challenge authority to attempt to find himself was the underlying meaning of the original , while in this one it is Kid repressing his true self in hopes to make his dead father happy . Where did the lightness of the original go ? I watched House Party 2 thinking that there is a limit that the writers could go without making Kid seem totally whipped by his father 's words , but we never hit that limit . Where , anywhere in this film , was Kid trying to find his rap roots ? I needed to see a young man still interested in becoming the lyricist that he once desired to be ? Why did he have to grow up so fast ? In fact , the rap side-story to this film seems to be the negative element . We have gone from loving the genre to completely disrespecting it in one film . Ah , the power of the sequel.Martin Lawrence was again completely annoying to the point in which I completely tuned him out whenever he spoke . He brought nothing to the story and nothing to the main characters . Lawrence was nothing more than a familiar face for the audience to relate to . In fact , it is that dedication to familiar faces from the original that hurt this sequel . When the ultimate PAJAMA JAM finally does occur ( one hour into this short film ) , we are hit with an barrage of repetitive scenes of aged rappers and comedians from the original who do nothing but repeat their lines , actions , and emotions from the first . While many may enjoy these familiar faces , I felt as if it were a cheap trick used to make me feel more comfortable about the film . If these minor characters had done more than just repeat their lines , than maybe I would have bought into the trick , but instead all I saw were cheap repetitive motions used by writers to fill time . I used the word `` repetitive '' several times in this paragraph because it demonstrated the annoying repetitive nature of this film and completed my point about using that element as a cheap trick . I hope it worked.In most television series , especially the cheapened kind , we sometimes hear a laugh track or a sound machine used to create some `` zany '' or `` wacky '' sound that lightens the mood and creates the viable laugh point . In House Party 2 , I do believe that the sound guy was extremely drunk or possibly working his first day in the booth . There were more sound effects in this film than in a Bobby McFerrin music video . Was this a child 's movie or another urban comedy ? Neither Kid nor Play could do anything in this film without a `` zip zim '' or a `` whoosh '' or a `` ding dong '' noise happening somewhere in the background . This was a fresh element to the sequel which direly needed to be taken away . There is a chase scene near the end of the film which felt like Pee-Wee Herman choreographed it with all the unsettling sounds that were happening . After the first twenty minutes of this , it because increasingly annoying to the point of insanity.Overall , this sequel soils the original . The themes were sporadic ( i.e . in one instance we are talking about the oppression of the African American , while in the other the directors seem to be building age-old stereotypes ) , the characters continued towards their bland downward spiral , those annoying , randomly placed racist police officers were back , and the dominating `` father '' element seemed too serious for the overall theme of this film . I hope this film was n't an indication of the path of colleges in the future ? House Party 3 , do n't fail me now ! Grade : ** out of *****	-1
It would be nice to be able to tell people that `` The Bachelor '' is a funny , interesting story about a man facing the inevitable commitment of marriage with fear and trepidation . It would be nice , but it wo n't happen , because while this movie starts with a good premise and then gives the viewer a strong half-hour of entertainment , it ends up being a tedious film with too many cliches , weak characters and an all to predictable ending.The story of Jimmie ( the usually good Chris O'Donnell ) , who finds himself moving closer and closer to losing his prized bachelorhood as one by one his friends get married off . Jimmie finally decides it is time to propose to his long-time girlfriend ( the beautiful , talented Renee Zellweger ) despite the fact that he is not ready to settle down . Predictably , his proposal goes badly and he is forced to deal with the consequences of his actions . The immediate aftermath of the proposal is very funny , and if the movie had stuck to following these two characters attempts at repairing their romance , this could have been a very good movie . Instead , the movie slants off in a `` Brewster 's Million '' -type storyline involving an inheritance that can only be earned with a marriage and children . Jimmie 's search for a bride is not interesting , not funny and the end is way too predictable.It is especially unfortunate that the makers of this film chose to take the movie where they did , because it wastes a very good cast and fails to take advantage of a nice chemistry that O'Donnell and Zellweger showed early in the film . Zellweger 's performance is as good as any she has given and O'Donnell does as much as he can with his poorly written character . With Ed Asner , Hal Holbrook , James Cromwell ( who 's scene with O'Donnell in a boat is the only good part of the last two-thirds of this film ) and Shani Engum , the supporting cast is filled with capable actors who are given nothing to work with . It would have been nice to see this cast put together in a good film.Overall , despite the good start and fine cast , this movie does not provide good entertainment . It is too bad , because it could have been so much better .	-1
Sugary-sweet and woefully lame , The Bachelor stumbles on its way to the altar . Chris O'Donnell stars as a good-natured guy who adores his adorable girlfriend ( Renee Zellweger ) , but just ca n't commit to her , just ca n't work himself into a marrying man . And so she leaves . Unfortunately , it 's right about now that O'Donnell 's grumpy grandfather ( Peter Ustinov ) kicks the proverbial bucket . And what does gramp 's do ? Yes , that 's right , he leaves the millions of dollars behind for O'Donnell , but only if he marries by the time he is 30 years old . O'Donnell does n't really want the hassle , but the family-owned company wil get the hostile take-over treatment if he does n't come up with the money to save it . So what does O'Donnell do ? He chases down Zellweger , who can see in his eyes that he 's not coming from the heart . She refuses and O'Donnell is forced to track down every ex-girlfriend he 's ever had , imploring them to marry him . Of course , O'Donnell soon realizes that true love was right there all along , but now it might be too late.It 's a terribly familiar plot , and it 's put across with increasing desperation and sentimentality . Even a wonderful cast ca n't salvage the mess . O'Donell is all charm , no depth . Zellwegger makes every word and every emotion feel real , but it 's as if she 's in a different , better movie . Marley Shelton , a rising star , scores points as Zellwegger 's supportive sister , while Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook chew the scenery as O'Donnell 's friends/advisers , and James Cromwell treads weater ( barely hiding his embarrassment ) as a priest who sticks with O'Donnellm in case he finds Mrs. Right.Director Gary Sinyor tries every old trick in the book , from quick cuts to dream sequences , from cameos to blaring songs . Too bad Sinyor did n't let the story do the job.As it stands , any marriage between The Bachelor and its audience is bound to be brief and movie-goers can cite a premeditated overdose of schmaltz for the inevitable break-up .	-1
What an utterly terrible movie ! What an odd look at marriage ! What a waste of talent ( Renee and Chris ' talents are lost in this cinematic mess ) ! What a cheesy and predictable plot ! What a terrible ending ! What a waste of money ! What a waste of time ! ! ! Honestly , it does n't get much worse than this . I admitt , cheesy and predictable can be fun ( eg . `` The Cutting Edge '' `` Never Been Kissed '' or `` Miss Congenialtiy '' ) , but this movie misses all the marks . When it 's not boring , it 's just ridiculous.Try `` Cricle of Friends '' or `` Bridget Jones ' Diary '' on for size instead . Really , you 'll thank me .	-1
I found this movie to be silly and at times irritating . It did have a few ( very few ) touching moments , and 1 or 2 chuckles but this is NOT a keeper . The film is blatant in its use of stereotypes ( desperate women/weak men ) . It was hard to be sympathetic with Chris O'Donnell 's character , when he was willing to throw away the `` love of his life '' for 100Million $ , oh , wait , he was making the sacrifice for his employees . And why was everyone ( especially the lawyer ) so surprised by the amount of money in the estate ?	-1
Chris O'Donnell certainly has the potential to be a great actor . He should not waste is time selling just his pretty face . The plot was non-existent and when it existed it was too transparrent.We love Ren & eacute ; e Zellweger , her roll in Jerry Macquire was perfect . She had virtually no lines worth remembering . The best part of the film came when the Priest was speaking with O'Donnel on the lake near the Palace of Fine Arts . O'Donnell realized what love was , at least for him.One more point . Unless Ren & eacute ; e Zellweger 's character and that of her roommate were making more than $ 500,000 per year , they could not have afforded that appartment . I have been in that appartment , the rent was $ 5,500 per month and the condo was worth more than $ 1.5 million . You figure !	-1
I absolutely LOVE JD and would probably pay money to see him read a phone book . After seeing this horrible movie , watching him recite the Yellow Pages would have been highly preferable . Even Depp 's talents and sex-appeal could not save this stinker of a movie . I have to rate it a 2 simply b/c Johnny was in it- lol !	-1
The Astronaut 's Wife , starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron was a major disappointment . My husband and I have what we call the 30-Minute Rule when it comes to watching DVD 's . Since our spare time is so limited , if we are not completely engrossed in the movie at the end of 30 minutes , we stop and put something else on.I 'm sorry to say that The Astronaut 's Wife did not make it past the 30-Minute rule . In fact , I found myself watching the timer , wishing the minutes would go by faster so we could find a better way to waste our time.The first thing is , the movie is slow . Very , very , very slow . There are lots of camera angles on Charlize Theron looking thoughtful , Charlize looking pensive , Charlize looking worried , Charlize looking scared , Charlize looking sad- well , you get the idea . Everything seems to happen as though we are watching it through a very long tunnel -- noises are slightly muted and have an `` out-of-body '' sound to them.Even Johnny Depp is not enough to save this movie . The feeling I generally get when watching Johnny Depp in a role is that nobody else could have played that part because he makes it so much his own . In this instance , however , I can think of a dozen different actors who could have played the part , and we would n't have noticed the difference.If you must watch it , put it on fast forward and read the subtitles . That way you 'll get it over with faster .	-1
Not a good buy . I purchased it and watched it on a Sunday night . This movie got a lot of bad reviews from profesional critics and movie watchers , and I am afraid they may be correct . Overall I do not regret buying and watching this movie . Some movies are good , some not so good , and some are terrible , but how can you judge the good one from the bad one if you never see the bad ones , therefore give this movie a chance and you be the judge .	-1
I still ca n't figure out what , exactly , this movie was about . I was confused from beginning to end . Possibly I was so bored that I just did n't pay attention . This has to be one of the worst movies that I 've seen in a long time , and I 'm not hard to please .	-1
I ca n't imagine how anyone could even sit through this cluster of a movie much less rate it five star . The premise is hardly unique , writer 's fictionalized world becomes reality . Its been done to death . Stephen King 's 'Dark Half ' comes to mind . Anything that is even remotely scary is prefixed with the volume rising , the music getting jangly and then a dozen ghoulish jump cuts are flashed in tenth second intervals : fangs , tentacles , axes , bloody smears , scary faces , slamming doors . If this is n't bad enough , the volume escalates to annoying levels ( so you know its a scary part ) and there are roars and tearing noises , and rushing wind sounds you 've heard in a dozen 'B ' movies . In fact , every scene that has something scary in it is a re-hash from other movies . Does the dark road where something pops out of nowhere sound familiar ? How about the doors that slam open and shut by themselves ? Seen enough dobermans set loose on people ? Scenes repeating themselves endlessly like Groundhog Day from Hell ? Painting that changes like Dorian Gray ? Give us a break . BTDT.The only thing that keeps this disjointed set of scenes moving is Sam Neill appears in most every scene and even he looks like he 's embarrassed to be there . I 've never heard of Julie Carmen , the leading lady in this debacle . I can see why I never heard of her , a more wooden job of portraying a role I have never seen . I do n't know how she got the part but I suspect the phrase 'casting couch ' could be bandied about .	-1
Sometimes this guy can be a genius and sometimes he produces highschool video camera quality movies . This is one where it could of been good if they played out the twist better . Sometimes , it 's the twist that makes the movie . This just failed to deliver on every aspect a good scary movie should have . It 's not like he did n't try , but the monsters are mediocre , the lighting is fake as hell , the suspense is not there , and Sam Neill is not a good character for this role , never is , even though he tries these horror movies over and over again . For being a scary movie in general , sure I 'd recommend watching it , but I expect way better out of Carpenter .	-1
boring and predictable . I had trouble staying awake . A disappointment after a promising summary and start . blah bla blah . required words .	-1
I own the Laser and it looks better crappy transfer of a movie I love after giving other movies like From Beyond better then perfect I would have paid more for great one ! No behind the scenes ! Glad Ididn , t buy others for friends who were expecting great enhancement ! Going to give it away not Amazons Fault ! Waste of time on the last great Carpenter flick	-1
I do not know who these reviewers are but I think they are on crack . This movie is stupid , convoluted and boring . the scary parts were not scary and the rest is a rambling hodge podge of trying to figure out what the hell is going on . Bad Bad Bad Bad movie do n't waste your time on this dog ...	-1
This was like a combination of & quot ; Alice in Wonderland & quot ; and HBO 's & quot ; Oz & quot ; . The storyline brings a giant man named John Coffey whose size does n't compare with his thoughtfulness ( Ah , hon get a kleenex ) . He possesses powers to help heal others . But , when he attempts to cure two adolescant girls and comes up short , he appears to have murdered them . Coffey is on death row shortly after , in a cell with a bunch of psychos.Poor old prison guard Tom Hanks rolls around screaming and cringing at the pain he faces every time he has to urinate . And a mouse races around , squealing with no sign of slowing down until another inmate stomps on it . For Coffey , those are misfortunes that he was able to cure . Next thing we know , everybody loves the guy and noone wants to see him die . Poor Michael Clarke Duncan was a main character in this and in the tremendously bad & quot ; Armageddon & quot ; .There are a lot of indirectly grisly electrocution scenes featuring Coffey 's cellmates . The entire absurd idea is that innocents die and there is no way that it can be avoided . Does it make the matter different by showing a character who goes from feared to admired to dead ? No , this movie just repeats an age-old fact that no one cares about . This is n't by any means moving or gripping . It 's bizarre and proposterous .	-1
I 'm not saying & quot ; The Green Mile & quot ; is a bad film.I 'm not saying that at all.I am , however , disgusted that people can say this is a better film than & quot ; American Beauty , & quot ; and here 's why. & quot ; American Beauty & quot ; was an incredibly filmed , superbly written film that shined a mirror on too many American families ... possibly why some did n't like it. & quot ; The Green Mile , & quot ; however , was a hybrid of sap drama and far out sci fi . This is n't a good hybrid either ; not like a mule , more like a three legged dog . First of all , it is far , far , far too long . There are about seventeen too many scenes with the way-overrated Michael Clarke Duncan moping around or mumbling or weeping or grabbing someone and healing them . Someone needs to learn that compelling drama + science fiction = this movie = drawn out , melodramatic bore . It 's not all bad . The ideas are , for the most part , original . ( Is n't originality what sci-fi is all about ? ) But as original as they get , it ca n't compete with the overall quality of the film . This movie makes too clear the edges between good and bad , black and white . What we need is more movies like & quot ; American Beauty & quot ; to show us the utter vastness of that gray area . The lines between good and evil are clearly seen here , too . ( Paul vs. Percy , Coffey vs. Wild Bill , etc . ) , making it far too sugary sweet to be enjoyed long enough.In my opinion , Hanks would have been a better Best Actor nominee than Duncan a Best Supporting Actor nominee ; how overrated can a performance GET ? I would bet 4/5 of his scenes feature him cowering in his cell block , mumbling incoherent babble , or grabbing Hanks between the legs . Why do grown men crying touch people so ? I could get up there and act as John Coffey ( if I was a bit older and taller ) , and so could almost anyone here that 's faked a few tears in their day.It 's certainly worth watching , if for no other reason than writing a bad review just like me , but do n't be fooled and expect too much.2.5/5 Stars ( I have 2/5 of there , would have been unfair to round to 3 , but my real rating is 2.5/5 )	-1
Take one part big , black negro , one part white liberal jailer and one part fantasy and you have & quot ; the Green MIle. & quot ; A black man accused of killing two white girls goes to a jail to await the death penalty . Myth . IN those days , the death penalty would have been meted out by the community at one of their & quot ; lynching bees. & quot ; Secondly , his & quot ; magic powers. & quot ; See , this is the racist mind of Stephen King at work . He has no blacks in his Maine community , and the only blacks he sees are the ones on sports TV . So his image ofd & quot ; super black & quot ; is in his mind when he writes this story . The black with super powers who is on & quot ; equal terms & quot ; with less than average whites . Ai n't that the way it always is ? The Green Mile is a joke and hails back to the days of & quot ; Birth of a Nation & quot ; in its degree of racism . That 's why it got all those awards . Have n't any of you noticed yet that the only way a movie featuring a black gets an academy nod is if the role is degrading ? Denzel goes from militant to uncle tom in & quot ; GLory ; & quot ; Butterfly McQueen plays a black steretype in & quot ; Gone with the wind ; & quot ; Morgan Freeman plays a black chauffeur in & quot ; Driving Miss Daisy. & quot ; See ? Now we have Duncan , a giant of a man ( who one reviewer called a & quot ; behemoth & quot ; ) who kowtows to whimpish Tom Hanks . This makes the second time a black man turned in a superior performance to Hanks and Hanks got the nod . The first time was in & quot ; Philadelphia & quot ; where Denzel stole the show . & quot ; The Green Mile & quot ; is a joke and an historical insult . Where wree all these liberal white folks when slavery was in existence ? THink about it .	-1
Like most indie gay themed movies , `` Trick '' had quite a bit of buzz around it . A terrific movie with Tori Spelling ! How could I not love it ? I loved `` Die Mommy , Die ! `` , `` Girls Will Be Girls '' , and `` Jeffrey '' . So I got ta love this too , right ? Right ? ? I found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality . A hot go-go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb ? Uh ... why ? ? So they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy . And then it 's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans . As much as I ca n't stand Tori Spelling 's `` acting '' , she 's the only performer not phoning it in . ( Maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots ? ) What little life there is in this movie , it owes it to her.The problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking . The `` sizzling '' dancer looked like bored monkey . And the soft , sensitive Gabriel has no personality . Why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery . I guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy ( which would n't be too much of an effort for him ) , there would n't be much of a movie.A cameo by Miss Coco Peru is a nice treat . But she 's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish , you 'd think she was in a different movie.High expectations , very low gratification . Honestly , skip it .	-1
Where does one begin in reviewing this travesty ? Here is perhaps the greatest stage work in the English language on one hand ; and on the other hand here is a highly overrated and overblown ego in charge of producing it on film . The result is an unmittigated disaster that would turn Shakespeare 's stomach were he unfortunate enough to have survived the watching of it.Let me make just a few basic points to explain . Although Branagh claims that he has filmed an `` uncut '' version of the play , he never really explains what he means . There are at least three important early editions of the play ( 1st quarto , 2nd quarto , and 1st Folio ) , no two of which are identical . What Branagh has done was to pick and choose bits and pieces from each , seemingly at whatever whim hit him , and patch together his own `` uncut '' edition . In reality , the play NEEDS cutting ; in the First Folio , supposedly created from promptbooks removed from the Globe theatre when it burned down in 1613 , it seems clear that Shakespeare had made several cuts and emendations from the 2nd quarto ( the longest of the three major editions ) . Branagh might have benefited from considering Shakespeare 's motives for these changes . He might also have acknowledged the cut of the one sentence that is clearly missing its completion , probably due to a copyist 's error.In casting this film , Branagh follows his usual practice of asking , `` How many stars can I put in cameo roles . '' There is little logic behind many of his choices . The most unfortunate is that he uses the great Jack Lemmon in a role that is so far from removed from even a hint of typecasting as to be ludicrous : Would you hire a 75 year old as a palace guard ? Other absurdities include Gerard Depardieu as Reynaldo ( Reynaldo ! ? ! ? ! ? ) and Robin Williams as Osric . How embarrasing for such great talents to be wasted and ( incidently ) mis-directed in these roles.I also think that Branagh 's decision to show that Hamlet and Ophelia were intimate is a serious mistake . If it were at least an intelligent , thoughtful interpretive concept , I might be able to live with it -- although I doubt that it makes sense that they were actually lovers in a physical sense -- but here it is clearly extra-textual ( so much for `` uncut '' ) and typically self-indulgent ; is Branagh such a sex symbol that he must add a lovemaking scene to Hamlet ? I have to make one additional ( though it 's hardly the last or least ) complaint . What was Branagh thinking when he set this in the 19th century ? The only logic that seems apparent is that he thought it would look interesting and colorful . Certainly there is nothing peculiar to the era that supports the choice . I am certainly not opposed to playing with time and place when staging Shakespeare , but there needs to be some reasonable logic ( or better , some compelling reason ) for the choice . There is nothing like that here.If the reader wishes to find a good version of Hamlet , there are better options : Laurence Olivier 's 1948 film , though cut and now dated , is far more intersting and more meaningful . The 1964 videotaped stage production with Richard Burton , though flawed and not nearly as vibrant as actually experiencing it in the theatre was , is excessively superior . The Nicol Williamson version , also flawed , is also more interesting and far more intelligent . Finally , the overpriced BBC version ( Ambrose Video ) with Derek Jacobi and Patrick Stewart is a far better , more accurate and traditional ( and almost uncut ) production . Try one of these and skip Branagh 's excercise in self-aggrandizement.If I could give this film zero stars , I would ; Amazon insists that I give it one or more .	-1
Unfortunately our TV does not support subtitles . The accents were so heavy I simply could not understand the dialog . My fault , not that of the producers .	-1
I loved Kenneth Brannagh in his & quot ; Henry V. & quot ; I also loved his audio version of & quot ; Hamlet. & quot ; I am sad to say that this is by far the worst production I have ever seen . Taking & quot ; Hamlet & quot ; out of it 's time was a mistake . Instead of the dark backgrounds , the castles , and the beautiful scenery of Mel Gibson 's version , we have garrish backgrounds . Instead of Hamlet 's father portraying human sorrow , he appears as something out of a freak show . While Jacobi did well on the audio version , he makes Claudius somewhat of a drunk coward instead of the careful , shrewd , courageous , ambitious , and yet honestly remorseful character . Ophelia 's insanity turns from tragedy to laughter when they use the inappropriate straight jacket . Instead of a sorrowful Fortinbras who stumbles onto fortune and feels remorse over Hamlet 's death , Fortinbras comes off as a dishonest and hypocritical self server . ( This is not the parallel character that Shakespeare intened ! ) Even the background music does not fit . But do n't let my opinion of this stop you from watching Brannagh 's wonderful & quot ; Henry V. & quot ; Get the Laurence Olivier or Mel Gibson version of & quot ; Hamlet & quot ; instead .	-1
Hamlet is a famous story in Shakespeare literature . However , it was n't interesting to watch on Amazon . I hope other people who watched this video enjoyed it .	-1
This movie is pretty brutal . Irritating characters talk to the camera and tell you the laws of dating as if they could maintain a relationship for more than Mardi Gras weekend . At one point a character says `` Sex without love equals violence . '' No , this movie without alcohol equals violence.A group of guys including Jerry O'Connell ( I liked him better when he was the fat kid ) , head out to hook-up with some fly honeys , yo . But that 's all whack , yo . Ahem . Obnoxious , is n't it . Jerry goes home with Tara Reid and they have sex . Or was it [ violation ] ? There is a lot of other sex , but the story seems to focus ... actually it does n't focus at all . It 's just a series of vignettes . ... I like Tara Reid when she 's herself , but she 's played so many unlikable characters I 'm beginning dislike her . Ditto for Amanda Peet.Highest recommendation to avoid . If you need dating tips , try [ someone else ] .	-1
I am not sure what others see in this movie . I was unimpressed . The singing and dancing were on the sparse side . The `` psychiatry '' thing , freudian allusions , conscious and unconscious mind might have been cutting edge in 1938 but fall flat now . My wife and I got through this movie , but it is not one we would watch again . The DVD was a reasonable quality , the sound was adequate , the image ok .	-1
I like Ken Burns ... the Civil War is one of my favorite documentaries but `` Baseball '' is a deeply flawed series that is hard to recommend.- You will hear near endless variations on `` Take me out to the ballgame '' as background music that it becomes beyond grating . Once you notice it , you ca n't un-notice it is awful.- I am not sure why some of the talking heads were chosen . Why on earth would the series devote time to Mario Cuomo ? Sure , he was governor of NY and a brief minor leaguer but why does anyone care what he thinks about baseball ? Billy Crystal is famous for being a Yankee fan , I enjoy him , but again why is he featured so prominently ? - As others have noted , this is a HEAVY NY focused series . Granted the story of baseball certainly needs a heavy focus on the Dodgers , Giants and Yankees but Ken Burns ( from , shocker , NY ) clearly decided that NY was going to be the focus and it is a detriment to the series.- There is n't much variety in the talking heads . i.e . On top of a huge NY focus , it is the same people who mostly have no connection to the game other than being a fan . I get it , George Will is a baseball fan , were none of the hundreds of players or managers available to talk ? When talking about the 1950 's , surely some of the participants have to be around , right ? In short , the early innings are classic Ken Burns but once the 1920 's hit , it 's a Yankee fan 's series from then on out .	-1
I just bought this and after watching the complete series , if one did n't know baseball one would have thought that Jackie Robinson was the greatest , most amazing baseball player who ever lived . At least 1/4th to 1/3 of this series is someone is talking about in some way , shape , or form about the negro leagues , how blacks were kept out of the games . We know this-but to be beat over the head episode after episode ... It 's getting to the point in all of Ken Burns documentaries that race is the most important thing to him . Is it White mans guilt Mr. Burns ? It must be as I am sure Ken Burns will find racism if he ever does a documentary on the moon landings or water polo . Too long , too much beating the viewer with racism ... EVERY episode multiple times . We get it Burns . You did n't like slavery or racism .	-1
I expected to see a history of baseball . What this turned out to be was Burns guilt over the way blacks were treated in our counties past . There was way too much about the Negro league and Jackie Robinson . Why he wanted to be 'politically correct ' I do not know . I wanted to see more about the real greats of baseball Ruth , Cobb , Williams , Mantle etc. , etc.. Maybe Burns should stick to Wars.I would not recommend this to anyone , unless you want to see a distorted view of baseball .	-1
I saw portions of Burns ' Baseball on Major League Cable/TV on and off Christmas Day , including the Jackie Robinson segment , which was well done ( as a kid , I 'd seen him play at Ebbets Field : Yes , I 'm a New Yorker ! ) . But I also caught some of Barry Bonds complaining about the tough treatment he received from fans in Alabama ( is that the best he could do ? ) ... and then there was Bill Lee , who showed up wearing a `` CCCP '' cap ( as in Central Committee of the Communist Party ! ) . Why would he do that , and ( worse ) , why would Burns film him that way ? Since we 're in year four of the Marxist dictatorship of Zippy Obama , and all he intends for our once-great republic , Burns ' having taken essentially the same in-your-face lefty stance did not sit well .	-1
... out of all of the nightmare movies this is the worst one it 's so stupid .	-1
well i saw this one about 3 years ago , i thought it was one of the worst	-1
With boring main actors and a tedious story that never really takes itself seriously . This is my least favorite of the Nightmare films and although it does have a few scenes thtat save it from being a complete waste of time . The scene where Freddy rips off the top of his head and shows his boiling brains and let 's loose one of his best quotes in the series & quot ; You 've got the body , I 've got the brains & quot ; steals the show . The plot is rather boring with very few deaths and barely any interesting ones at that . With only Freddy to save this movie from a one star , I do not recommend you buy this film . But if you 've got to see all the Freddy films , then by all means rent it . It has just enough memorable scenes to warrant at least watching it once .	-1
After the fantastic third chapter DREAM WARRIORS I expected an evenbeter follow up in this fourth film . When I left the theatre in August of 1988I was crushed . NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 THE DREAM MASTER is anincoherent , nonsensical mess . A real dissaster . Let me reitterate A PIECE OFCRAP ! ! ! ! ! . The movie has no plot at all , just a bunch of effects sequences linked together by nonsense . Freddy returns , despite his `` HOLY BANISHMENT '' inpart3 , with no explanation at all . Lead warrior Kristen Parker is not only adifferent actress but comes across like a whole other character . New heroineAlice takes on the personalities and skills of her friends whom Freddy has killed . HUH ! ! ! Freddy seems to have almost God-like powers this time out andis able to transform one character into a tiny insect . Heck , if he can do that than I wonder how anyone can even hope to defeat him . None of this is ever explained.Characters resite a `` dream master '' ryme that is awful and makes no sense at all . I wont even try to explain the climax because I still have n't figured it out myself . Something about `` Freddy ca n't look at his own reflection or the souls of his victims will rip him apart from inside . '' HuH ! ? ? ! ! ? ? This was the most financially seccessful Elm Street film , but that is because of the big openning it had . When all the fans like me who loved the third movie laid down five ( this was 1988 ) bucks to see what would happen next and walked out wishing we had n't . A real stinker that totally insults Freddy fans.If you enjoyed this movie than allow me to recommend..HIGHLANDER 2 , ROBOCOP 2 , SUPERMAN 4 : THE QUEST FOR PEACE , JAWS : THE REVENGE , MORTAL COMBAT : ANNIHILATION , TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE : THE NEXT GENERATIONKING KONG LIVES , CAPTAIN AMERICA ( 1989 ) , the American GODZILLA ( 1998 ) or THE ALLNIGHTERTo all of you fans who were offended by this review . Let me just say that in 1988 I was absolutely in love with the Freddy series . I really TRIED to like this one . I found it hard to . The people I saw it with didnt like it . My friends hated it , and the kids I talked to in my high school didnt like it either . In fact I cant think of one person I talked to at the time who did like it . So , In my own defence , I dont believe I am alone in my opinions about part 4 . Like I said , I tried to like it and I WANT to like it . after all its Freddy , my hero from my youth , but its just such a mess . I know from the letters written the front of Fangoria in '88 that alot of people did/do like part 4 . But then I remember that alot of people like dope , alchohol abuse , self mutilation , child molestation and crack cocaine	-1
If you 're a fan of the NOES series , you 'll probably end up seeing this one , but let me tell you , it 's the same plot they 've been using since the original . It 's sad . To the point : to rate this movie is hard , but all you have to do is compare it to the rest of the series , and compared to # 5 : The Dream Child , it 's way better . Do n't be fooled , this is still a real bore !	-1
If ever there was a rallying cry for abortion this film should be it . Survivor from Freddy 's last bloodbath Alice ( Lisa Wilcox ) is the recipient of his demon seed . Freddy thus gains control over the fetus ' dreams and ergo control over Alice . But instead of taking the logical way out Alice insists on keeping the baby ( `` Grab your crucifix '' ) and in the process provides the fuel the story needs to power through another useless sequel . At one point one character , Mark , even thinks and then recommends that she terminate the pregnancy which she rejects outright . Mark just rolls over , like he was the father to be or something , and says `` OK we 'll just find another way . '' What a lark ! What follows is a battle for the heart and mind of the not yet born Jacob . Just think of it as a `` Rosemary 's Baby '' for a younger , simpler generation.The main problem this franchise faced at this point was that they felt every kill had to somehow be more awesome than the last . Early on there is a head-scratcher of a scene where Dan is turned into an actual Ghost Rider . And since they are tied to this idea that every kill has to supersede the previous one you begin to realize that this exercise in extreme silliness is only working against the films . They have become so far removed from reality that you can no longer take them seriously . I would argue that good ol ' Freddy jumped the shark a few films back , but as I watched this one I just had this image of his jumping sharks , one after another , in hopes that he could possibly destroy the legacy of even the first film . That said this one is a minor step up from `` Nightmare on Elm Street 4 . '' Here they dig into Freddy 's very past past and find out that he was the product of a rape that occurred at an insane asylum . Since Freddy has been messing with Alice 's baby she enlists the help of his mother in hopes of reigning in the deranged serial killer . The whole thing has a very Jerry Springer-ish smell to it . Since `` Nightmare on Elm Street 3 '' the formula has been about the same and they follow it here as well . Hero has friends who do n't believe in Freddy . Said friends have token hobby ( here diving and comic books ) . Freddy kills all of hero 's friends using their hobby against them . Hero beats up Freddy . The parents have n't gotten any smarter with time , but here their role is less pivotal . In this one there is a scene where the first thing out of Alice 's father 's mouth after her boyfriend has died is him blaming her boyfriend for his own death . Classy . The focus has shifted away from the idiocy of the parents and more on creating a nonsensical world for Freddy to frolic in . The only rule in this game is that Freddy is all powerful . My friend , who insisted that I watch the entire series , claims this one to be his favorite . I blame it on the fact that he is a comic book geek and thus represented here . . .although I 'm sure he would deny that connection . To me this is the second weakest with the original remaining the only one I can actually recommend . Freddy was running in circles and sucking wind by this point . At least Jason had the good sense to eventually move his freak show into space . **1/2	-1
This is the worset of them all . There is ver little fight back and action . The victins deaths are corney and stupid . There are some cheezy lines like don ; t sleep and drive . The part that makes fun of superman at the end was very cheesy.The only thing that keeps this movie from being a one is Freddy ; s whitty lines , the return of Alice from the fourth one . The return of Amada Kruker freedys mother Last seen in Nigmare on Elm Street three Dream Warriors . My Recomendations see 1-4 four and Freddys dead and Freedy versus Jason . Do not see Nightmare five unlesh your bord senlesss.I just hope Freedy dead and new nightmare are better . I am plannig on by 4 and Freddy Versus Jason .	-1
the worst film in the series , but good for laughs . freddy is too comical with rediculous killings , out of the blue family member , and subpar ending	-1
It 's blatantly obvious within the first five minutes that `` Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare '' is a different kind of `` Elm Street '' flick . Right out of the gate , the film sets a unique tone with its Goo Goo Dolls infused opening . Long gone is the terror of Fred Krueger , the man who haunted Nancy ( Heather Langenkamp ) in Wes Craven 's original masterpiece . This Freddy is a pop-culture icon , a comedian if you will . And his status only serves to dilute and justify the existence of this supposed closing chapter of the iconic '80s series.Like most '80s slasher franchises trying to make their way in the '90s , `` Freddy 's Dead '' struggles between carrying over a built-in audience and appealing to a new generation of movie-goers . The sixth entry in the beloved series , as helmed by long-time franchise line producer ( see : baby-sitter ) Rachel Talalay , ca n't help but succumb to the conventions that merely nagged at its predecessors . Rather than turning the odd joke in between killings , the man of your nightmares , Freddy Krueger ( Robert Englund ) , has become a full-blown comedian , and a lame one at that.While the film carries great production value and presents some of Freddy 's most outlandish nightmares to date , it suffers thoroughly in trying to spook its audience . Krueger has all the menace of Wile E. Coyote in this film , turning pure carnage into a Saturday-morning cartoon for the big kids . Englund is in fine form as the man of your dreams ( err , nightmares ) , but the film neuters him to the point where he serves merely as a punch-line . Talalay should know the character inside and out by this point , but she apparently lacks the vision to realize what exactly it is that makes Freddy tick . What was merely a symptom in the previous entry , `` The Dream Child , '' is a full-blown epidemic in this film . Put simply , Freddy is indeed dead.Now , `` Freddy 's Dead '' is n't completely horrible . For one thing , it 's a great looking film . If nothing else , it boasts the best production values in the series in its time . The film also features a gaggle of fun cameos -- from the likes of Roseanne & Tom Arnold , Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp -- which keep the affair fun and light-hearted . There 's no doubt that this is the weakest `` Elm Street '' of them all ( taking even the 2010 remake into consideration ) but there is definitely enough juice to keep it from becoming unwatchable . Just temper your expectations and realize that , hey , this the sixth film in a franchise wherein its main villain dons a Nintendo Powerglove . How great could it have ever been ? **Review revised on 07/05/2013**	-1
Plot : A boy is having dreams of Freddy and is learning dark secrets of his past . And he begins to wander 'Am I Freddy 's child ? ' We soon find the answer to that when Freddy drops him a hundred feet from the air onto a bed of spikes saying 'Bring me my daughter ! 'Review : I want to give this movie Zero stars ! It Sucked ! As all my friends know I am the biggest Freddy fan in school , but oh my god ! I was reading the reviews for this movie before I watched it , and almost everyone said it sucked , and I was like 'Oh come on , it cant be that bad ! ( ... ) Needless no say they were right . Me and my friends watched this and we were laughing our butts off ! The only reason me and my friends laughed is one : We have dark senses of humor ( we enjoy stick death ) and two : It Horrid ! Truly Laughable ! The death scenes where stupid ( blood spraying out of a TV ? Please ... ) And there is no gore ! I know a movie can be scary without gore , and I honestly prefer it that way , but some could have saved this maybe even if it was just an inch . And they never even showed how Freddy came back to life ( I know none of the others did , beside the 4th one but still ... ) And as I said before me and my friends were laughing the whole time . I 'm sure I lot of people would think this is great ( And I love comedy ) but how the hell can you rank this under horror ? The only thing scary was how bad it was ! Now , I love the first one . Best horror movie ever . Plain and simple . But this could possibly be the worst horror movie ever . Know why ? I 'll tell you : IT IS NOT HORROR ! I know I have said this a lot but my god , a two year old would be laughing at this ! How can this be rated R you ask ? I do n't know , honestly . There are only two things I like about this movie : 1 How it flashed back to show Freddy 's past . Cool . And two : Carlos 's death . I know I said that I did n't like this movie being comedy , but this scene was just SO funny ! He pops the guys head ! Anyway those are the two good things about the movie . I do n't think I have anything else to say but I am glad Wes Craven hated this movie and come back , create Freddy , and kill him the way it was meant to be done : HUMORLESSWhatever . The only reason I am keeping this movie is so I can tell people at school & quot ; Yeah , I have all the Freddy movies & quot ; PS you can hit that No on the & quot ; Did you find this review helpful , but I am just warning those who like the true Frederick .	-1
Freddy Kruger is a popular character . He earned himself a wax statue in Movie land , wax museum of stars in Clifton Hill , Canada . He also was on the walls of Screamers , Canada 's best haunted house along with Jason and Micheal Myers . Along with thatSpawn toys made an 18 inch figure of him . NONE of that success was because of this . This movie was horrible and here 's why,1 : The kill scenes in this were stupid . I mean come on , one kid was just standing in front of a train ! 2 : In one sceane Freddy is playing a video game ! Come on ! ! ! ! ! 3 : Do n't you hate it when then call it Freddy 's dead or Jason goes to hell ? It gives away the ending ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( and if it 's the end , then why did they make a sequel ? ! ? ! ) 4 : What 's up with how Freddy died ? I thought it was gon na be an explsion or something like that but nooooo ! ! 5 : When relesed in theaters it said it was in 3D , with is true but how long was the 3D ? 25 minutes ! ! ! ! ! Friday the 13th 3 was in 3D to and it was the entire thing ! ! ! ! This is not something to go near . The next one called NewNightmare , is MUCH better and secound best ( the first is the best ) . The box has 3-D glasses but besides that this is not worth it .	-1
I love the franchise but I have to vote this as the worst Nightmare on Elm Street film by far . Even the reboot was better . Freddy 's Dead looked silly on release and it has n't aged well at all . New Line had way too much fun with this one because it 's not scary , well-acted , or funny and the special effects are atrocious ( including the pointless 3D at the end ) . It brings a lame-brained plot twist of Freddy having a ( previously unmentioned ) daughter to carry on his legacy . The casting is the worst of the series and there are no romantic angles to engage viewers dramatically . The kids are very annoying ( except Breckin Meyer ) and they do n't die . Lisa Zane almost saves it but there are way too many problems with makeup , special effects , editing and delivery . I like Yaphet Kotto but did n't appreciate him hitting Freddy with a baseball bat when he is n't the guy to play the `` Final Girl '' ( WTF was he doing ? ) . Adults do n't normally fight Freddy aside from his getting burned in his own boiler . All the ideas in this film were quickly tossed in ANOES 7 : New Nightmare and never returned . Parts 1-5 had a lot of continuity but this one asks the viewer for too much while delivering too little . It almost feels like it was made by a different studio because it 's so strangely cobbled together . Admittedly , audience preferences were shifting but this entry was completely off the mark for what came before . Freddy 's Dead introduced the ridiculous plot device of Freddy speaking straight into the camera ( `` It 's travelling time ! '' ) that was continued in Freddy vs. Jason ( `` No one is afraid of me anymore. ) . Since when do scary villains serve as the narrator ? Freddy 's makeup is ridiculous because you can see Englund is wearing a mask especially with the skin around his eyes poking out . Even great cameos from Johnny Depp , Alice Cooper , Roseanne , and Tom Arnold ca n't save it . The ending feels like a friendly reunion that lacks punch and almost destroyed the franchise completely . The ending of Part 3 : Dream Warriors was much more fitting for a conclusion to the series . Amazon reviewers give this a lowly 3 star rating.ANOES fans should check out the much better films included in theA Nightmare on Elm Street Collection ( All 7 Original Nightmare Films + Bonus Disc ) [ Blu-ray ] .	-1
This movie had a great idea behind it . However , it was poorly written , directed , and acted , which was its downfall . It seemed more like a video game than an actual Movie . Futhermore , the chillful atmosphere that was in nightmare on elm street 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 , are completely gone and is more of a way for people to make money than to actually make a good movie .	-1
The movie was not the best effort by Robert Englund or Wes Craven . They did a good job at blurring fiction and reality , but all in all a disappointment . As I watched this movie I thought to myself , why is Wes Craven so famous for ? Sure he 's made two classic movies- Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream but thats about all . I love Wishmaster , but im sure people dont even remember it . Last House on the Left was bad or at least I thought so . The last three or four movies he 's done has been flops . So why is Wes Craven so popular ? He really hasnt done much . Come on , I know there is a reviewer out there dying to answer this .	-1
I was fascinated at first with how intriguing Magnolia seemed to pretend to be . As the story went on , you could readily see that the highly mysterious beginning had absolutely nothing to do with the actual film . Nor are the individual characters in the movie intermingled at all , as the film purports they are . There is n't any cohesiveness . Great performances by he actors ... all did a charming job ... but the stories were mostly boring and had almost no depth at all . And way too much music . Half the movie was a music video for Aimee Mann 's great songs .	-1
It was with a shudder of apprehension that I picked up this movie after noticing that it was the same director who did & quot ; Boogie Nights & quot ; . But my research revealed mostly positive ratings by reviewers . So I decided to spend the three hours and see what all the fuss was about. & quot ; Boogie & quot ; was interesting and effective in some ways , but way overlong and downright obtuse in making its sociological points.This movie has none of & quot ; Boogie 's & quot ; good points and all of its bad points , plus some others . How about a hackneyed theme -- could you select one & quot ; better & quot ; than dysfunctional families ? Lack of communication ? Manipulation in relationships , whether parent-child or lover to lover ? These tired themes are handled so badly in dialogue and character portrayal that I found myself shaking my head in disbelief.And what about feeling and passion in a film that would seem to be all about intensity ? Even with stellar actors , you wo n't find it here . The roles played by Robards , Cruise and others are caricatures . The dialogue is lame almost beyond belief.If you need to be reminded that parents , friends , and lovers should be more caring , kind , communicative , and attentive , I would suggest that almost any self-help book , Ann Landers column , or Hallmark card would be better than this heavy-handedand overwrought movie.If you want a positive look at some of the same types of problems , with fine performances and useful insights , try Lawrence Kasdan 's & quot ; Mumford & quot ; or & quot ; Grand Canyon & quot ; . The closest this movie comes to a coherent message is when , after almost three hours , a young boy complains to his manipulative father , & quot ; You need to be nicer to me & quot ; .This director needs to be nicer to his audiences , and some editor or artistic advisor needs to rein him in , suggest that sublety and sensitivity are a better mix than smarminess and special effects .	-1
This movie sucked worse than an old Hoover vacuum cleaner . My God , what did the director think he was doing ? Now , I know there are a lot of pseudo-intellects out there who see something deep and apocolyptic in this film . To them I say get off the drugs and try reality . This stream of unconsciousnes crap is the worst of a very poor year in the movie industry . The notion that Cruise was nominated for this is ludicrous.The great climax has power only in its ability to turn ones 's stomach . That the director took three hours to tell this tale shows how sadistic a person he must be . Half the people in the theater left when I saw it originally . Trying it a seond time with two carbon enhancement , did n't help either .	-1
From Aimee Mann screeching through a unending , fingernails-on-a-chalkboard rendition of & quot ; One is the Loneliest Number & quot ; which drowns out all of the dialogue at the beginning of the movie to the unconventional ending which frankly was way too little , way too late ( most well-adjusted viewers would have called the suicide hotline by the end of the second hour ) , we 're presented with nothing but miserable people doing miserable things to make their miserable lives even more miserable.Appealing only to sheltered college student/art types who love to revel in misery and constant over-the-top profanity . They wo n't be disappointed , and by the reviews I 've read , they were n't .	-1
The cast of Boogie Nights does the most depressing movie since the Passion Of The Christ . If you do n't feel like being entertained by a movie , and want to be bored , upset , depressed and otherwise SICK , watch this [ ... ] One of the worst ever .	-1
I know I 've given it one star , but only because I could not give it a negative 10 ... .. It 's just the `` F '' word strung together over and over for three plus hours . In fact , if you took out all the times the `` F '' word was spoken , then you 'd have a twenty minute movie ... .I ran out to see this picture immediately upon its release because I was so impressed with Anderson 's Boogie Nights . Now , I use Magnolia as my rating for the worst film ever made ... .After an hour into the film , I wanted to leave but was certain that it had to get better . After two hours , I felt I had vested too much time in it to leave . At over 3 hours I had to stay until the painstaking end and then I literally , screamed out , `` I want those three hours of my life back ! `` Just absolutely horrible !	-1
This is only a kids way to see & quot ; Short Cuts & quot ; ( which , by the way , was heavily overrated as well ) . After having seen this and having read several reviews of it before seeing it , I was puzzled to say the least . I search my memory to find a more overrated film but I fail to find one . Not one single theme in the film is treated with any depth . The actors are all terrific in their handed roles but the roles themselves are idiotic . If this is the way people are in America , then indeed : & quot ; God Bless America & quot ; . But it is n't . The only role that was half believable was the male role of the nurse of Jason Robards . Do n't waste Your time with this one : It 's phony , phony , phony ! ! ! The frog-rain in the end is good but it wo n't save the movie . The star above is for that rain .	-1
My roomate and I set down to watch this movie , and we were jazzed after the first few minutes showing little sequences of coincidence . I thought this was going to be great . A few story lines that all tie into one big ending . Oh I was pumped . Three hours later ... a waste of my freaking time . Imagine someone taking an episode of Family Ties ( one of the & quot ; Very Special Episodes & quot ; , ) a bad Trapper John M.D . episode and a cable access program , splicing them all together so as they jump around and none of them have an ending that relates to anything else , and you have just made the sequel to Magnolia . Save your money , buy a can of paint , pour it onto your floor , watch it dry then clean it up . That is much less a waste of time than watching this flick . Almost as bad as English Patient ( that is saying a lot . )	-1
Next Friday was n't as funny compared to the original cause there was no Smokey and the thugs in this movie were n't all that funny , the returning characters are Craig , Craig 's Dad , Deebo and the next door neighbor Stanley ( cameo ) .The story is about Craig 's father taking Craig to Rancho Cucomonga to protect him from Deebo ( who escaped from prison to get revenge ) . Deebo was n't as good in this one compared to the original.Then Craig meets Uncle Elroy , who just won the lottery and his cousin Day Day ( he 's no sidekick compared to Smokey ) and they meet the next door neighbor thugs.I only recommend this movie to the hardcore fans of Friday and I 've seen Friday After Next and it 's alot better than this one cause Day Day was actually funny in that one and the whole movie was funnier .	-1
After the pure comedic brilliance of the first film & quot ; Friday & quot ; , I was expecting the sequel to be just as entertaining , but not quite as funny without the presence of Chris Tucker.Unfortunately , & quot ; Next Friday & quot ; is neither funny nor entertaining.The writing is very uninspired and shows no creativity whatsoever . Which , of course , affected the performances . Ice Cube is downright dull and Micheal Epps totally lacks comedic timing and screen presence . Unlike Cube and Tucker in the original , Cube and Epps have no chemistry in this film . The jokes are stupid , senseless and are not funny . This movie is a downright disgrace and a complete disaster from beginning to end.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Do n't waste your money on this one . You 'll be sorry .	-1
This one stars a very derelict looking Nick Nolte , a handsome Brook & # 65533 ; s Brothers suited Jeff Bridges and a very young looking Sharon Stone . The story is about three friends that were involved in fixing horse races twenty-five years ago , on the periphery of organized crime . They have some deep , dark secret from those days . The Nick Nolte character is letting the secret leak out . He seems to be trying to sell some allegedly pornographic pictures that are somehow connected to their secret . When his old partner Jeff Bridges finds out what he & # 65533 ; s been doing , he goes on the warpath . The problem is we have no idea what this is about or what & # 65533 ; s going on . Nick Nolte is too drunk and too disheveled to believe . Jeff Bridges is the opposite ; we have too hard a time believing his character was ever a fixer . The one and only strong point in the movie is the race track mobster played by Loyd Catlett . He is evilly charismatic . Nick Nolte makes an attempt to sell the alleged pornographic photos to him . Catlett & # 65533 ; s character is totally cool and on top of his game . He & # 65533 ; s so sharp while acting cool that he & # 65533 ; s riveting . He & # 65533 ; s playing his end of the game like a grandmaster . You really can & # 65533 ; t wait to see how he plays his side of the game . Unfortunately , his was a wasted performance , because the rest of the movie is hopeless , so bad , it should never have been brought to screen . The presence of three major stars couldn & # 65533 ; t salvage it . Sam Shepard , normally a great screenwriter , should be ashamed of this one ; it & # 65533 ; s a stinker .	-1
I 'll admit that I was entertained , but some of the moments in this movie was just downright goofy ! I found the scene where the guys were all huddled together and reciting lines from & quot ; Wall Street & quot ; like toddlers watching & quot ; Barney & quot ; completely lame-brained . I also wished that someone else could have played the role of Seth . Giovanni was particularly hard to watch with a straight face as he whined and sniveled during the climax of the film . His presence alone cause the two star rating on my review . Other than those major drawbacks , the suspense will keep you interested all the way to the end .	-1
This movie goes from dark and ugly to ridiculously cliche . I saw in this movie an example of the dangers of absolute unbelievability for a film rather than absolute power of a president.This could have explored the real dynamics of presidential power but instead was a cliche & quot ; suspense & quot ; thriller that was too silly to care about . When it was over , my friends and I simultaneously broke into laughter . That was all it was worth .	-1
I read the brilliant book first ( always a good idea ) and got the film expecting a similar reaction . If you want a standard Clint Eastwood thriller with a top notch crew then this is your standard fare . It 's all fairly nice and staid and rather slushy at the end but if you want a version of the book DO N'T BOTHER it is a virtual rewrite , leaving out the main character Jack , his daughter 's ex-boyfriend completely . The basis of the book was built around him defending Luther and finding out the truth . In the book the daughter hates Luther , in this she just vaguely dislikes him . Do n't want to give to much away but Luther is n't even in the end of the book and the way he manipulates the authorities is non-exsistant . See what i mean ? they should of said 'based on the book ... but only a little ' .	-1
This is yet another in the long line of teen horror films spawned by Scream . This film has a sort of supernatural twist to make it stand out . Death is an essence is the theme , the essence you ca n't escape . This is just antother formulaic teen horror flick packed with teens in fashion mode , with a few bloody wrecks along the way . What I ca n't tell is , is this film using its stupidity of the supernatural undertones as a joke the same way Scream flicks use thier overt stupidity , or is it really meant to be taken seriously . Either way you should really skip this one .	-1
** 2000 . Written and directed by James Wong . Six students and a teacher manage to escape a plane crash thanks to a premonition of Alex Browning , one of them . A few weeks later , Death starts to kill the survivors one by one . FINAL DESTINATION is basically a stupid movie about a good idea . There is n't here only one smart scene or idea , it seems that the director wanted to please the teen audience by delivering another pimply shocker and that 's all . In these perspective , a film like Peter Jackson'sThe Frighteners ( Director 's Cut ) which handles some of the themes of FINAL DESTINATION is a masterpiece ! This one is unfortunately already forgotten .	-1
yawn . After seeing movies like 'Rec ' , or even respectably good horrors like 'Exorcist III ' , movies like 'Final Destination ' feels so boring , so forgettable , so dull , you wonder why you are wasting your time . I hate half-assed movies like this one . For reasons I do n't understand , they are hyped , as well as movies like 'Screams ' . On IMBD this film has a rating of 6.7 . A good movie like 'Exorcist III ' is rated at 6 , yet the latter blows 'Final Destination ' out of the water . I 'll go back to sleep .	-1
Why Why why ? I dont understand how this movie get such good reviews ... Just like the Scream Movies , etc . The Teen slasher era has to end , these movies are boring and just a waste of money that coulda been used towards a better movie . The story is far from original , a guy who sees whos gon na be taken by death next . Please , i think Micheal J . Fox 's performance in the frightners was good enough . The acting blows , the actors , blow , this movie blows ... .however , everyone 's entitled to like whatever they want ... Any movie is a good movie . it just depends on its audience ... thank you verdy much..	-1
Over acting as usual , ( Jim ) by one of the great over actors of our time . Ace , and Lloyd are still super funny ... This was a bit tedious .	-1

I love the radio show . But this was not that . Instead we eavesdrop into contrived backstage personalities that I ultimately just did n't care about , and found little to do with the radio show . Was this about Prairie Home Companion , or was this some other movie with Garrison & crew performing somewhere in the distant background as a pale backdrop to stories that I just did n't believe . And Lindsey Lohan , who has broken the 4th dimension by becoming a strange personality more powerful than anything this bad actress can create , was too distracting . Seeing her I kept wondering what Paris Hilton was doing right now .	-1
I have been a big fan of the radio show Prairie Home Companion for over a decade . I have also read several articles by Garrison Keillor who is , without a doubt , a gifted writer.I came to this with an open mind , not knowing what to expect.To say the least , it was a big disappointment.It was about as entertaining as watching paint dry.I kept waiting for something to happen as the story line just meandered along like a slow moving bovine not having any idea where it was going.It is long.It is boring.It is without any of the inspiration that powers the radio show.Avoid this movie at all costs unless you suffer from insomnia .	-1
Good grief this thing was DULL . The film version of APHC lacked all of the charm that made the radio show a success over the years , despite Keillor 's long-winded and sometimes boring stories . His character of Guy Noir is generally somewhat interesting in the radio show , but Kevin Kline as Noir never really fit into the story here , nor did he develop a believable character . Also , the `` angel of death '' metaphor was overworked and ineffective here . A few bright spots were the singing duets of Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin , and Woody Harrelson and John C. Riley . Otherwise , it was a chore to endure and the regular radio show staples of Powdermilk Bisquits and Rhubarb Pie were tired and just served to remind viewers of how much better this format worked on radio . The film would 've been more entertaining had it concentrated on the stage performances and left out the backstage quips and stories . Finally , the stereotypical uptight fundamentalist Christian , portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones , added nothing to the story and served as yet another cheap shot at Christians . A very disappointing effort .	-1
Based on the ratings , I suspect kindhearted people think they SHOULD praise this film because of the likeability of its stars . But from the heavyhanded appearance of `` Death '' to the self-conscious acting styles to the endless songs ( you deserve a medal if you do n't ever hit fast forward ) , this simply does not even approach the charm , wit and easy musicality of the Prairie Home Companion radio show . Also , the DVD transfer seems a bit dark .	-1
How can so many talented people make a movie this bad ? Given all of the positive reviews it had received , I was really looking forward to seeing this film . What a waste of time ! It tries to be some deep meditation on death and the passage of time but what it succeeds in doing is drain all of the charm from the Prairie Home Companion radio show . All of the actors are playing caricatures but Kevin Klein takes home the ham for over-acting . On top of that , the performances were so loose that at times I thought Altman turned on the camera , threw out the script , and just let the actors goof off . If you like Garrison Keillor , buy his audio recordings of the real PHC . If you like Robert Altman , buy MASH or Nashville or Gosford Park . Just stay away from this muddled mess .	-1
There is nothing new here . No suspense , no thrills , chills or actually any `` horror '' . There is just gore , gore and more gore . I am pretty shocked this had a major theatrical release given how much there was here.There is very little `` interesting '' history or background given about Thomas and the crazy Hewitt family . Leatherface 's origins are summed up in a few short minutes . Town becomes deserted , and instead of moving or finding work elsewhere , crazy guy decides eating people will be better ? More unbelievably , the whole family just goes along with it ? Could have used more back story there instead of the `` they 're just crazy '' explanation . Leatherface just snaps and starts killing people one day , or had there been previous signs he might one day decide to rev up a chainsaw and stick it in your belly ? Then we get a thin story about two sets of young lovers , brothers , draft dodging , and Vietnam . Throw in a crazy motor cycle gang and a car accident ... oh dear here comes the crazy Sheriff.The rest of the `` plot '' just outright sucks . The story makes no sense in a lot of places and gets confusing , especially around dinner time . I will give credit for the ending because , going in , I knew being a prequel no one was going to make it out of there , but I kind of had hope for Chrissie at the end ... and well , it was an interesting scene . I also give credit because they did not try to make Leatherface likeable or make you feel sorry for the `` big retard '' which given all the gore , might have made things too complicated.I am a fan of Jordana Brewster , but has her career stalled so much that she needed this on her resume ? 1.5 stars , rounding up to two for the weak reasons stated above . Casual horror fans should probably avoid this .	-1
Wow , what a waste of time and money this pointless `` prequel '' is . Just another reason to lay on the gore with a garden hose and once again cash in on the title with little regard for the audience or even a decent plot.Waste of time ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I just received a copy of It 's A Wonderful Life 60th anniversary edition & I 'm very disapointed ! I sent Amazon a e-mail asking if the movie was in color because their dvd format say 's ( In color ) & I did n't want the movie if it was in B & W ; beacuse I already had it . I received a e-mail back from Amazon & they assured me that it was a colorized version of the movie . Well , I got my DVD today & on the back of the DVD it say 's B & W. This is the same movie that was released a couple of years ago . It has the same stuff on it as the last movie they released . ( The making of it 's a wonderful life & A tribute to Frank Capra ) . There is nothing different about the movie . Paramount just wants to make more money . That 's all it amounts to . So , all of the questions in these reviews are answered.THIS MOVIE IS BLACK & WHITE- NOT COLOR ! ! ! ! ! ! ! If you already own this movie do n't buy it ! You will just be getting a copy of the movie you already own & they wont refund your S & H , because the movie is n't defective . Amazon needs to watch what they are doing . They need to start putting the right DVD format on things . This is the second time I 've got taken by Amazon saying the DVD format is color .	-1
Not a good Cary Grant movie . Good actors but not what you would expect . Too long and dragged out . Love Cary Grant but not in this movie .	-1
( Please note that the DVD edition I am reviewing is the Laserlight release that features introductory remarks by Tony Curtis . ) The biggest problem that I had with PENNY SERENADE was the pacing , or lack thereof . The first half crawls by at a tortoise pace , with the main characters taking forever to get from point A to point B . By contrast , the second part flies by far too quickly , with huge jumps that skip us past large sections of the characters ' emotional lives . It seems to end with a shockingly depressing twist that comes completely out of nowhere , but in literally the last minute events change , robbing us of any emotional investment that we may have made in the process.I hate to be so negative of this film , especially given how uniformly excellent the cast is . With the lone exception of a single child actor ( who is n't nearly as bad as some other children would have been in the role ) , the acting is believable and superb . Even during some of the more comedic sections , Cary Grant has toned down his more over-the-top excesses , creating a character that is realistic , but also amusing . Irene Dunn is similarly excellent , and allows her character to seem swept along by events , but not letting herself be carried away in the melodrama . The two leads gave balanced and thoughtful performances that were a joy to watch.The beginning and middle sections of the film really drag in places . I do n't mind slow-paced movies , but in PENNY SERENADE there seemed to be long stretches that were neither interesting nor plot advancing . For example , there 's a ten to fifteen minute section that takes place in Japan , apparently for no reason other than for the main characters to be caught in an earthquake . There are scenes that take forever to build up , and result in little pay-off . It 's very frustrating to sit through all of this , especially when one considers how rushed the final part of the film is.The last part of the movie ends up feeling much choppier and more hurried than the previous sections did . We jump from scene to scene without fully seeing the motivations and reasons behind the action . Several major events take place off screen and are only referred to . I would n't have minded if it was just one or two moments , but it seemed to me that every important event was missed which severely reduced the emotional impact . The ending to the film itself feels like a complete cheat . I hate to see films that resort to cheap tricks to provoke a reaction from the audience , but that 's exactly what happened here . And worse , the contrivance is n't even played up to its full potential . The emotions that we 're supposed to experience are totally undercut in literally the final seconds of the film by another illogical plot twist that comes out of nowhere . I suspect ( but do not know ) that the studio requesting this in order to create a false happy ending , but whatever the reasons , it ruins any emotional substance in what was already a fairly dubious conclusion.The incoherence of the ending is n't helped by the fact that virtually the whole film is told in a series of flashbacks . These flashbacks consist entirely of Dunn 's character sitting in a chair , listening to old records , and thinking about the events that led her to the present . Now , I do n't mind flashbacks in movies at all . I think that , handled correctly , they can add a great sense of discontinuity and mystery . It can be quite intriguing to figure out how the flashbacks will eventually lead to the present . The problem with the way they are handled in PENNY SERENADE is that very little has been set up beforehand . The flashbacks serve no purpose other than to simply be there as a gimmick . The structure does n't add anything to the film and serves only as an annoying distraction.The DVD 's introductory remarks by Tony Curtis may come as a surprise to viewers familiar with his comments that have accompanied other Laserlight releases . Often his introductions are unintentionally hilarious , with Mr. Curtis bouncing between incoherence and almost gleeful hamminess . But in his preamble to the feature movie here , he comes across as someone who is genuinely a fan of Cary Grant and of his impressive body of work.All in all , I was disappointed by this movie . There are some very good and very sweet moments ( especially those that seem designed to get past the very strict censors of the day ) , but overall the film feels disjointed . The acting from the main performers is excellent , with additional credit going to many of the well-acted secondary characters . But the acting alone could n't save this film . The story is too padded in the beginning and too shallow at the end . The directing does n't save the film from its own flaws . There a several good individual portions , but taken as a whole it just does n't work .	-1
I love Doris Day and this movie is funny , entertaining and fun to watch . The only disappointment here is the dvd . The sound is mono and the quality is not the best , could have been better . That 's why a give it a 2 for quality . I hope they give this movie a better treatment . I 've seen older movies look and sound better than this . Great cover though . Now I wish they would give this movie that touch of mink .	-1
One of Cary Grant 's worst vehicles , & # 34 ; That Touch of Mink & # 34 ; ( 1962 ) finds the inimitable screen legend going through the motions in a tiresome & # 34 ; romantic comedy. & # 34 ; Zero chemistry between Cary and Doris Day , with a good supporting cast doing its best to prop up the contrived hijinks . Both stars are too old for this nonsense.OVERALL RATING : *	-1
How do I describe this ? Let me start by saying that when I was nine years old I saw my sisters 'The Waltons Playhouse Set ' sitting on the table and screamed in sheer terror ! The family , that truck ! Ok , fast forward to 'Amityville Dollhouse . ' I thought that sheer terror would never return . It did . It 's so interesting to see how each of the 'Amityville Horror ' sequels manages to distance itself from the original.What we have here is a film so ridiculous it can also be entertaining . ( Thus the 2 stars . ) This involves a family that has a house built nowhere near Amityville ( great place for a sequel ) and in there back yard is a shed with an old dollhouse in it . Guess what ? The dollhouse looks exactly like the Amityville house . Of course with demons included . Now , I hope your still with me , they have a little girl . It 's her birthday . What better birthday present for a child than a dollhouse from hell . The events that follow really shake this family up . The fireplace with the dimmer switch in the living room acts up . A giant mouse crawls under the little girls bed . The parents have a sex scene in the middle of all of this . It 's like the pool scene from 'Showgirls ' in hell . The older brother takes his girlfriend to the shed in the backyard for sex , and of course there is a mounted insect in there that comes to life ! During sex it bites the girl in the -- well , lets not go there . You have to see it to believe it ! When it attacks the guy needle nose pliers come into the picture . After seeing this film , and changing my shorts I just had to write a review . All I can say is that when all this is done , in the last scene of the movie you 'll think to yourself , '' Thank God they have a pick-up truck ! '' Pay close attention to the closing credits and you 'll see ( I 'm not making this up ) that the director has an assistant director , who has a 2nd assistant director , who has a 2nd 2nd assistant director ! It took all these guys to make this . Did I mention the burning girlfriend ? Or the lusting mom ? How about the little boy pounding stakes into dads feet ? I 'm going to watch 'The Waltons Homecoming ' now . I need to see something really scary .	-1
I do n't blame the movie as much as I blame me for watching this stuff knowing that it is n't going to be any good and then getting mad because it was as bad as I thought it was going to be . The whole series has been very minor as far as a horror series are concerned . So even though this is WOW BAD , I 'm keeping it going by watching , OH SHAME ON ME ! ! ! LOL ! !	-1
Being a huge fan of the first two n.o.t.d , i must say that this one just made me sick to my stomach ... and not in a scared way but in a & quot ; how more stupid can this movie be ! & quot ; way ! Many things that you 'll expect to see in this movie , a canadian production with montreal actors that never practiced the actual art of acting , terrible special effects , the longest opening credit sequence before the movie starts , bad choice of location..especially the & quot ; new & quot ; hull house in the film , totally different from the original , and of course the ending , whoooowww so scarrrryyy , WILL THERE BE NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 4 ? I think that after watching this movie for yourself , you 'll understand why they did n't make another part 4.Thanks to the producers of this film for screwing it all up for us fans !	-1
This movie was terrible . Maybe it considered good for the era it was released . Acting bad , monster bad , just bad . Sorry	-1
... but I was severely underwhelmed by `` The Boogens . `` This is a very pedestrian effort . Step-by-step , i was ahead of where the movie was going and invariably dissapointed when it got there . The monsters are unimpressive , the actors are nothing to cheer about , and the script is weak in all respects , except one : the lead characters are not as dumb as the average players in the most typical tales of this type . It 's not a bad film , per se , but it 's most remarkable feature is its total mediocrity.If you want a good monster movie of this vein , I recommend the classic `` Island of Terror . '' If you want something a little more contemporary , go with `` Tremors . '' The former is closer in tone and nature to `` The Boogens '' than the latter , but both will sate your need for creepy critters and thrills more effectively than `` The Boogens . ''	-1
That 's how much I would have paid to see this movie ( unfortunately it cost quite a bit more ) . Simply put , the movie is about post-traumatic stress disorder . It centers about a concentration camp survivor and how his horrible experience has damaged his personality in such a way that , if personalities could be likened to natural landscapes , his would look like the Mojave desert . Lumet uses flashbacks from the concentration camp period to make his point , as well as various other symbols . Steiger 's performance is excellent , but the subject matter is inevitably bleak and I found the movie hard to enjoy because of it . For me it had little entertainment value . It sure is great when a movie makes you think , like this one , but what if all the thoughts that it evokes are depressive ones ? At least that was the effect on me . So , if you had a long and hard week at the office and want to sit down Friday night to enjoy a movie that would entertain you , uplift your spirit and soothe your tired brain , then maybe this is n't the one to watch .	-1
Simply the worst western ever made - boring ( a slow-moving movie where the two leads fail to show even the hint of a romantic spark between them ) and illogical in the extreme ( Cooper 's sheriff waits 90 minutes for a third gunman to arrive in his town via the train to join his 2 buddies before engaging them in a gunfight ) . What 's worse is that after the train arrives the director , who has made the audience sit through 90 minutes of soul-searching by the pacifist sheriff , stages a poorly done gunfight . Overall , another wooden performance by Cooper ; nobody ever accused Kelly of being able to act . Only one good scene : the preacher sell out Cooper in front of his entire congregation . Stay away from it .	-1
I absolutely adored Jennifer Tilly in the Chucky movies , she 's the woman girls should idolise , not the Nicole Richie 's of the world . She has curves and is proud to flaunt them.So why was I so disappointed in this film ? For starters , I hate movies about mafia , or anything of the sort , so only really watched this film for Jennifer Tilly , plus , it was a birthday present . It was n't good in my opinion . I did n't find the scenes between Jennifer Tilly & Gina Gershon in the slightest bit sexy , and I did n't get turned on . The two actresses certainly had chemistry , I just did n't find the scenes where they progressed to the bedroom sexy . It just did n't do anything for me , which I was quite surprised at.I did n't watch much more of the film , as the start of the film seemed to be mostly Jennifer & Gina getting it on , and then it descended into mafia rubbish . I watched the first 40 minutes , gave up , and will quite happily never watch it again .	-1
I am still seething having bought what I believed to be the ultimate Highlander experience . Not only is the quality of the picture grainier than a bowl of cornflakes but the THX & quot ; experience & quot ; is , bar none , the WORST soundtrack I have ever heard . In short DO NOT buy this dvd - maybe some day people like Mr. Aaron Spelling will realise that consumers are not the slack-jawed yokels he believes us to be.What a complete waste of time and money ( my money that is ) . Mr. Lambert , Mr. Connery and co. are rolling over in their respective graves - figuratively speaking of course ! ! I tried posting this review with a 0 star rating but was unable to - needless to say the 1 star I had to give is 1 star too many .	-1
The resolution of this DVD is very , very poor ! Even a VHS is better than that . If you want to convince someone not to buy DVD , just show him ( her ) this DVD ! END	-1
Absolutely horrible . I must have misread the front label , but is n't this film supposed to be THX-certified ? It is beyond any doubt the worst looking film in my DVD collection at this moment . I even have a Madacy DVD which looks better than this ! Where to begin ... .the picture quality is extremely blocky , I see compression artifacts left and right and up and down . The grain of the film is too prominent . On and on ... bottom line : I think the VHS version of a non-director 's cut of Highlander looks better than this DVD . And the sound ! Groan . Sometimes I could barely hear the dialogue which sounds thin and reedy , and in the next scene the sound effects come blaring out the speakers . The sound quality is very uneven ; it almost seems like the producers of this DVD took a monophonic soundtrack and attempted to make it into 5.1. Who knows ? As for the extras ... HAH ! It is totally disorganized , almost as if someone took a stack of papers/photos off the desk , scanned them randomly into a computer and transfered them onto the DVD . Furthermore , the photo gallery repeats a lot of the photos ( duh ) and zips right by at 24 photos a second ( duh ) . By the time you realize it , probably 200 pages have gone by before you can hit the pause button.So , is there anything to like about this DVD ? Well , it does show the uncut widescreen version of Highlander as seen in Europe , so Americans may see a few extra enlightening scenes . There is a commentary by the makers of the film , which is of some interest ( and which I found to be more listenable than the actual & quot ; THX-certifed & quot ; soundtrack ) . And the price is quite affordable . Fans of the film will probably want to buy the DVD , even though it looks and sounds pretty bad ( you 've been warned ! ) .But for the picky DVD collector , for goodness sakes , stay away from this DVD !	-1
This movie was just terrible . This is definitly down there with ... uhhh ... , WELL , who am I kidding , this IS the worst film of all time . I can not stress this enough ! The direction was bad , the acting was worse , and the plot , if there was one , made no sense AT ALL ! As far I 'm concerned with the Highlander series , this film never existed .	-1
I need to confess a bias up front : While the film is every bit as bad as the previous reviewers have stated , parts of it shine for me.I like the image of an old McLeod unredeemed in spite of winning the Prize years before . Shades of the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell , who pointed out that once you actually get the Grail , the tribulations are not over . Now you have to bring its healing contents back to your community . And that is NO easy task . McLeod tampers with the course of the world instead of helping people talk to each other ; the result is an energy shield ( sort of like a missile defense shield ? ) that saves the planet temporarily but sets it up for a future version of the Dark Ages . ( Notice all the fans . A premonition of global warming ? ) When more Immortals arrive on the scene -- two lame , tongue-rolling idiots from the distant past -- McLeod begins to realize that the game 's not over yet . So when his future friend , a terrorist , asks him whether someone has just died , he replies , & quot ; Unfortunately not. & quot ; HA ! Sean Connery 's entrance is also memorable : to the accompaniment of a stroke of lightning , he lands in the middle of Hamlet , when the actor playing that character laments , & quot ; Alas , poor Yorick ... & quot ; And the scene in the oldest tailor shop in Scotland is good for some laughs , Ramirez being the oldest ( and most demanding ) gentleman in Scotland.Michael Ironside 's commandeering of the subway train ( & quot ; Let 's have some fun ! & quot ; ) is amusing , but the brief flash in which you see the baby spinning down to the bottom of the car was entirely unnecessary.Why & quot ; The Quickening & quot ; ? Because all the main characters learn to manage and direct the Quickening instead of just being incinerated by it when they cut a guy 's head off . The Quickenings themselves are lame , except for McLeod 's first one , which is awesome -- you can see the aliveness of that serpentine force as it walks toward him -- but the Quickening idea is psychologically interesting . McLeod employs it to reach Ramirez . Ramirez saves lives with it . General Katana energizes a train with it . Such energies are in themselves neutral ; it 's what we do with them that counts.In fact , the Immortal looks very much like another underground class of eccentrics ignored for the past two thousand years : the shaman . & quot ; From the dawn of time we came ... . & quot ; There are shamans bright and dark , even now , regardless of whether they received some traditionalist training or attended workshops on soul-retrieval . As the most recent Highlander film makes plain , you do n't become a shaman until you get wounded unto death.Probably the film 's best scene is the sacrifice made by Ramirez , and his assessment of it : & quot ; Most people have a full measure of life , and most people just watch it slowly drip away . But if you can summon it all up , in one time , in one place , you can accomplish something glorious ! & quot ; Amen ! My one disagreement with previous reviews is that something was irretrievably lost , even in the Renegade Version , by having McLeod and Ramirez come from the past . It was a move of dramatic desperation , yes . No archeological evidence exists to corroborate the existence of an ancient high-tech civilization . But : the origins of the Immortals remain a secret . Even the reactionary priests of that early time do n't know it . But they do invoke a familiar statement when they send McLeod and Ramirez on their way into the world of today : in the end , there can be only one .	-1
If you love the Highlander 1 movie and the series ( except for the very boring Raven series ) then do not watch Highlander III do n't get this & quot ; self contained story & quot ; theory of this movie . They should 've just called it something else entirely and simply made a standalone scifi movie . Instead the suits nearly sunk the Highlander franchise by trying to ride a cult cash wave started by the first movie.Even if it was a standalone movie , it would still stink . The crappy looking anti-gravity surfboard fight scene made me want to turn off the TV.The magic of the concept of the Immortals is lost when they become simply long-lived aliens . ( wow , writing that re-reminds me of how bad this movie is ) . The mystique of not quite knowing what the Immortals are is what made the first movie ( and the series ) so great . Are they angels ? Mutants ? You never quite know and you do n't need to know.Avoid this movie ; do n't give the suits the satisfaction of making another red cent on sales of this movie . I 'm glad I borrowed my friends ' copy instead of paying for even rental of this tripe . ( sorry if any of you likes tripe ; )	-1
Unless you are lucky enough to own the director 's cut edition of this film , I suggest that you stay away from this version . It is bad , bad , bad . It completely stains the original concept and idea behind the immortals . It is badly casted , badly acted , badly shot , and just bad all over . I sat through the whole thing once and that was it . For some reason , the immortals are aliens in this version , and they come to Earth to find Connor MacLeod and kill him . The rest of the film is just as stupid . Even the fighting sequences are boring . Trust me : You are better off with the original film , or the TV show . It may change a few things , but not as badly as this horrible film version did . Skip it , at all costs .	-1
Connor Macleod [ Christopher Lambert ] , After winning The Prize at the end of the original Highlander , is no longer an immortal and has now become an old man in the future . When the ozone layer is destroyed and the sun begins to unleash deadly radiation upon the earth , Connor and a team of scientists build a shield which shields the earth from the sun , sending the earth into a world of darkness . But meanwhile , Connor 's old enemy General Katana [ Michael Ironside ] from Connor 's home planet Zeist [ ? ? ? ? ? ] arrives on the earth to kill Connor once and for all . A LOT of Highlander fans will be quick to tell you that this movie was the worst of the series but after viewing Endgame [ check my review for that movie ] , I 'm here to tell you now that this movie is NOT anywhere near as bad as the fans will have you believe . Yes , it 's true that this movie goes against everything that the first film 's plot established being that the immortals are now aliens from the Planet Zeist [ did n't Connor come from Scotland in the first film ? ? ? ? ? ] and for the fact that Ramirez [ Sean Connery ] is somehow back in this sequel despite being beheaded in the original and yes it 's true that the story for this movie really does n't make any sense at all but i found myself being able to sit through this movie all the way until the end and while it 's not as fun as the original Highlander , I find this movie watchable in spite of its numerous horrible ideas . The special effects are pretty cheesy in the original version of this movie [ i heard they were updated in the two later re-cuts of this movie but i 've never seen either of those yet ] and the dialogue is often extremely silly but it does boast a few memorably funny moments [ like the scene where Ramirez interrupts a Shakespearean play ] and it does feature another memorable villain in General Katana [ played well by Michael Ironside who along with Connery steals the show in this movie ] . For many Highlander fans , The sole thought about the immortals being from another planet is enough to turn people away from watching this movie but luckily for those turned off by the new plot developments of this sequel , there is always the Renegade version for you to watch [ and that and the 2004 special edition are the only versions available on DVD and Blu-Ray since the original version has never been released on either format and probably never will be released on DVD or Blu-Ray due to the general hatred for this version of the film ] . I am not saying that this is a great film or even a good film but for what it is , It is a watchable albeit silly action/sci-fi film and it 's probably best to just view this movie as a standalone chapter in the Highlander saga . Whatever version of this movie you like , You have to admit that there are way worse movies out there than this .	-1
If there was ever a first sequel to a movie that was up for the most awful one ever reward . This would be it . There is probably no other first movie sequel out there that is worse than this one , when compared to the first in the series . Some series are just crap altogether . But everything in this movie was awful , the story was pathetic , the acting okay , did I mention the story was pathetic ? Goes to show what happens when execs try and cash in . Awful , I would n't even give it one star .	-1
When Highlander II came out people were walking out of the theaters only halfway through the movie in droves ! Probably no other sequal within 10 years of its making caused so many complaints from movie audiences.There probably isnt a better example in Hollywood history of how how studio execs . took the biggest potential money making series and nearly killed it with one film.Any reviews you read stating `` its not that bad '' are highly suspicious.Dont buy it , dont rent it ... .its not even worth watching just because your curious about how bad it really is .	-1
Is this the version where he stays with the woman til she is old , grey and dies ? That is the version I saw and want to buy and see again . Remember Queen 's music , saw 1 , 2 , 3 at theater , hoped for help in reviews . the 3rd one was not worth repeating , perhaps II . Who was the woman I yearned for , even aged , with silver grey hair , was reminded by commercial with similar woman , 30 years , now 65 Plus one on Sept 17th . - Tom ( bluepuma ) Will stick with David Arkenstone CD 's purchase otherwise .	-1
I was all set to enjoy a different version of Highlander 2 when , in the first scene , the main character walks up to some strange woman and has sex with her up against a stone wall . Since when was our main character so rude and crude ? Not my cup of tea . I watched this when I purchased it a few years ago so ca n't remember much else to comment on . Just a bad movie any way it is cut or added to .	-1
.Olive Films once again releases an older film worth seeing but at an inflated price and without subtitles or sdh . WHAT A SHAME ! ! !	-1
I read the reviews and thought this may be a great series to add to the Video Library . Boy ! ! ! I was so wrong ! ! ! I only watched one show so far and it is a real snoozer . I enjoy vampire flicks but this one really SUCKS ! ! ! ( No pun intended ) I do n't know if I can get through the rest of it . I will try . However , so far I am most disappointed.UPDATE : I tried watching the rest of the DVDs but I could not . It was not interesting enough to finish . I returned the DVDs and was amazed to find that out of the $ 25 plus I paid for the DVDs I only received $ 8 and some change back . I did n't have the DVDs long and they were excellent condition . The fees for the return and some storage fee ate a good part of my return . THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN ! ! ! ! From now on I will be more careful about the fine print from Sellers . We 're done here .	-1
I have loved this series since it first aired . When this set was announced I was so excited . I immediately pre ordered . Now that I have watched the dvds I can sadly say the image quality is worse than my original VHS set . The colours are dark and muddy and dull . Very sad they they could not put greater effort in enhancing it as it should have been . If you do not have any other copies of this then it is worth it but if you have the VHS set stick with it . It is better quality .	-1
Guilty pleasure filmmaking at its finest . The story is as old as time , devoid of originality or insight . The acting is atrocious , even old salt Olivier . Ahh , but the music ... ..campy , overwrought , silly , yet compelling as a train wreck .	-1
Neil Diamond 's film career began and ended with this hopeless turkey , which is an insult to the original play and the subsequent 1927 film with Jolson that changed the film business.This was also a terribly shameful moment for the once-great Olivier . He made more of a fool of himself here than he did in THE BETSY ... and that 's saying something.I know the video industry has absurdly abused anniversary editions , but no company has been more abusive and insulting thanLION 'S GATE ( once known as ARTISAN , and LIVE ) .To celebrate a 25th anniversary of a horrendous film , shows how pathetic some people in Hollywood are just to make a buck.For shame !	-1
It 's been the rare music superstar who does n't turn their hand to at least one movie , and Neil Diamond is no exception . & quot ; The Jazz Singer & quot ; is not a good film , either cinematically ( Sir Laurence Olivier stated flat out that he did this one for the money ) or musically ( & quot ; Hello Again & quot ; is pretty , but much of the rest of the soundtrack tries WAY too hard ) . Diamond has a deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression for much of the movie , except when he 's singing . Olivier 's over-the-top performance is a treat for cheese lovers , though , and Lucie Arnaz actually does a pretty good job . Overall , though , if you 're not a Neil Diamond fan ( and even if you are ) , this film is pretty tough going .	-1
I rate this and `` Impromptu '' ( and also maybe `` The Piano '' ) as films that are so impressed with themselves and their supposed pedigree they do n't have to `` work '' , and the results are a rather tedious series of costumes , pictures , statements and events . Maybe it was the creator 's intent , but at the end of this movie you do n't give a crap about this egomaniacal woman and her emotional patchwork of a life ; just on the two hours you 'll never get back having endured this drivel .	-1
The good thing about this movie is that it did n't last more than it did . Not that it 's bad , no , it 's a fine depressing movie . It may be very well acted -Duvall is great all right- , with nice songs perhaps , well directed if you like ... But unless you feel identified with these characters -and I don't- there 's no way you can enjoy watching this.This is what I saw : All the characters here are self-centered individuals , conceited , self-pitying , deplorable and depressing . Duvall plays a drunk who quits drinking to start ( perhaps ) a new life . That he in the past was a sucessful country singer makes no difference to me , it just adds to his self-pity . I could n't find anything positive in this story . Even the kids that show are aggravating with their persistent questions.The picture we have here is that of a bunch of losers and dreamers . Everybody seems to blame someone else for his miseries . The children their parents , the wives their ex-husbands ( & viceversa ) . Death , either thru war or car accidents , plays a major role too . It seems people have trouble getting over it , looking for someone to blame it on . Then the scenes in the church ... I 'm not sure what they are intended for . The three main characters ( Duvall , Harper and the kid ) go to church ; him and the kid even get baptized , but they have no idea what church is all about ; to them it 's a social ritual ( a tradition , a superstition ? ) . This is not a movie about faith . It 's about the troubles of these guys ; the lady needs a man because she 's young and lonely ; the man needs ... he needs to grow up ; the kid needs a father and some homework . Nobody cares for others , only for themselves.Honestly , the irony about this movie is that it 's so realistic and its characters so phony . I understand why Duvall went immediately to make 'The Apostle ' , where he plays a role opposite to this one .	-1
I 'm appauled.I just received the screener copy for review and am disgusted to find that this set contains exact duplicates of the already-released *embarrassingly bad* transfers of each of these films . None of them are anamorphic widescreen ( all are 4x3-letterboxed widescreen ) and they look like they were mastered for VHS on a 19 '' screen : blurry , noisey , hazy , full of every type of video artifact you can imagine ( from print damage to poor compression to edge-haloing so bad it hurts your eyes ) .avoid this set at all costs . And write republic and express your displeasure with another release of the same-old-crap . Why ca n't this studio do proper 16x9 high-definition transfers of these classics like every other studio is doing today ?	-1
Was going to order this set but saw all the reviews that this set is butchered , I own the dvd set and would like the bluray to be the same aspect ratio . So this wont be a purchase for me , I really ca n't believe that they would re-format it to 16x9 , really ignorent people working at that company .	-1
This must be the worst movie i have seen ( And i liked Armageddon and Wing Commander ) .Bad effects , terrible plot and bad acting .	-1
There is something about the fact that this vampire uses or needs an airplane to fly around from place to place that just takes away from any horror this film could really create . Stephen King 's `` The Night Flier '' has a very poor plot and an even poorer cast of characters . Shame on you Stephen King ! ! Moreover , there is not one character in the entire movie that you can relate to or even sympathize with in the slightest.The movie centers around a selfish and crass newspaper reporter who is trying to track a serial killer who flies his plane from airport to airport in search of victims . It becomes increasingly apparent that this serial killer is not human.Now , the only reason this film does not get a 1 star rating is that the vampire is rather horrifying looking and the ending is slightly creepy , but everything else about this movie fails to evoke any interest in me whatsoever . If you really want to see a good vampire flick , you should watch the original `` Salem 's Lot '' , directed by Tobe Hooper ( not that `` new '' garbage that came out recently on TNT ) , which is one of , if not the scariest movie of all-time.To be quite frank , I 'm reluctant to give `` The Night Flier '' even 2 stars , but , as I said above , there are a couple of creepy/scary elements to it . If you see it on TV , you should check it out for yourself , but it 's not worth a penny to me .	-1
Although the subject matter is interesting ( Hurtgen Forest 44 ' ) , the film is weak . Ron Eldard does a good job in the lead role , but all of the other primary actors are poor . This is especially true Dwight Yokum who plays a sterotypical callous and ruthless battalion CO. Of course there is the angst ridden company CO and the cowardly platoon commander . The treatment of the Germans in the film is deplorable and in fact there are only handful of shots featuring German infantry . As far as simulating the actual battle , this film is a stinker . The Americans bunch up in attack like on a Sunday stroll and the Germans are able to foil an entire battalion attack with a single 88mm gun with no infantry support ! If you want a good & quot ; realistic & quot ; war movie , buy Saving Private Ryan , Stalingrad , Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! , The Iron Cross , or the Battle of Britain .	-1
This was a train wreck . I watched it thinking it 's got to get better . It does n't . Take a pass on this and save your change . Send me and e-mail and I 'll give you my copy . It 's that bad . The acting , for lack of a better word , is rudimentary . The plot , water thin.It is nowhere near the neighborhood of `` Saving Private Ryan '' . It 's one of the all-time worst WWII movies I 've ever endured .	-1
This movie is way over-hyped and i have changed my mind about this movie ... ... ..this is a love story gone wrong ... ... this does not belong in a collection of mob movies ... ..i am a mob movie collector and this movie just does n't cut it ... ... this may please your girlfriend ... ..this is almost comparable to Chaz 's performance in Boss of Bosses , IT [ WAS BAD ] ... . ! ! !	-1

Essentially this is a movie about one of many models chewed up and spit out by the fashion industry . With all the reviews written about the plot I 'll skip to the review.The intro to this 1998 HBO TV movie says that Gia Carangi `` In the early eighties ... became a legend in the fashion industry . `` In real life , she is barely a footnote in the fashion industry . Michale Gross , in his 1995 book `` Model , '' the most exhaustive and exhausting of all books on the fashion industry dismisses her as `` a bisexual drug abuser who had a short but visible career . `` As you can quickly tell from the sole opening credit ( Angelina Jolie , of course ) this movie is an Angelina Jolie vehicle . The problem is that this vehicle sputters throughout due to overwrought dialogue and acting which ties nicely back into the overwrought intro.With her post-lip , pre-nose job plastic surgery Angelina Jolie looks remarkably similar to Katie Holmes at certain angles.This type of movie-making reminds one of the old gangster movies of the '30 's and '40 's . It purports to be a warning of the dangers of its subject while maximally exploiting it ; in this case with nudity instead of guns.The two hour length of the movie is more tortuous than Angelina 's death scenes.Two stars , one for each attractive boob , real or not .	-1
I think Angelina Jolie is one of the most talented and beautiful actresses today and with all the rave reviews for this movie , I watched it as soon as it arrived.What a waste of time . I should have quit the first few minutes but waited to see what others saw that was so terrific . It 's , however , interesting to see how AJ 's nose used to look like .	-1
There was a real Gia from a real neighborhood - NE Phila . and a real time . No one from my neighborhood even dreamed of a sudden rise to fame but she caught a break and became very famous and wealthy at a young age . Before she was mature and wise enough to handle it . This movie makes ZERO effort at capturing the real person or in capturing the time , place and people where the story is set . It takes the tabloid headlines , sensationalizes them for its own lurid purposes and is praised as great entertainment . If they want to make a fictional story , do n't say that it is based on a real person .	-1
This film draws on an extreme true-life story that seems sure to make a person feel and think . In 1979 , a rough , wild , pretty 19-year-old from a broken home leaves Philadelphia , where she works behind the counter at her father 's Italian diner and hangs out in seedy nightclubs , for New York City . She becomes a phenomenal success almost overnight as an elite , new-wave , jet-set fashion model with `` attitude . '' She parties on the wild side , has a close , on-and-off lesbian relationship with a makeup artist , suddenly loses her agent/mentor to cancer , and heavily abuses harder and harder drugs , frequenting `` needle parks . '' Quickly , she burns out her body , relationships , and career . Reduced to trading sex for money , she is beaten up and raped . She is arrested for reckless driving and resisting arrest . She tries to make a career come-back and to go home . She sells jeans in a local shop . After repeated tries at rehabilitation , she either relapses or attempts a massive overdose . In seclusion in a hospital indigent ward , she dies in 1986 at 26 of the newly discovered AIDS.Angelina Jolie gives a raw , emotional performance , combining child-like and hard qualities . The generally well-acted main supporting characters are thin ( especially the idealized , `` sweetness and light '' Elizabeth Mitchell character ) , at times hammy ( Mercedes Ruehl ) , but have some basic believability and traits that play into the drama ( Faye Dunaway , Ruehl coddling and pushing ; Ruehl and Mitchell withdrawing for various reasons ; Eric Cole as a decent but dim hometown pal ) . There are glimmers of poignancy in some interactions and details of the experiences . Probably the film 's most effective moments are the model 's relationship with the makeup artist and destructive drug use ( dominating the last half ) . The movie conveys ( partly by fictionalizing and tightly limiting its snapshots of her life ) a sense of frenzy , loneliness , and emptiness -- life in a dead zone.Yet , the movie is startlingly unsatisfying on any but the most basic emotional level of watching the vivid , photogenic Jolie act out the fateful events , with flashes of striking visuals in recreated settings and with perhaps the invitation to viewers to project onto the screen whatever trite , preconceived notions they might want to see about emotional problems , exploitation , or addiction . The film seems to lack any point of view . It narrates through sketchy , spotty vignettes rather than thoughtfully examines . The movie lacks detail , context , depth , substance , and insight , the characters and events little more than a blur . It barely scratches the surface , if that , of what were her `` demons , '' how and why they came about , what was special about them , why they hit her so hard , and why drug abuse was her answer . ( Regarding technique , scenes shift arbitrarily from color to black-and-white and back again , sometimes accented by heavy-handed music ; they alternate with awkward , glib documentary-style `` interviews '' ; and the long , distinctive chain-link-fence photo shoot and shower scenes , intended to be candid and uninhibited , are hampered by the staginess of the apparent effort to avoid full frontal nudity , even in the extended , uncut version . ) Consistent with statements in the film that `` No one knew Gia '' ( including her ) , its treatment of her background , emotional problems , promiscuity ( among a flurry of quick , slick throwaway lines at the start we are told , but never shown , that she `` slept around '' but sex `` was not the goal , '' `` was not an issue '' ) , overall relationships , lesbianism , drug addiction , and ( strangely and especially ) her modeling talent , career , and world ( `` America 's first supermodel '' ) is vague , minimalist , and simplistic . Particularly weak or artificial are the statements mouthed by actors playing her contemporaries in the retrospectives ; by the Italian photographer who spouts drivel as pious philosophy ( `` This is life ... . '' ) ; by the scornful , speechifying woman in the stilted , scripted rehab scene ; and most disappointingly by the model herself and her `` journal '' ( presented as poetic gems of meaning but falling far short of any such thing , even the message she wanted to send from her deathbed oddly off and easy , given her experiences : `` she wanted to tell kids , you can handle it , you can handle anything that comes your way '' ) . The movie does painfully little to delve beneath surface notions and manifestations and to illuminate any real understanding of this woman 's situation , even less why she was a human being worthy of all of this special attention.As a result , those reviews that claim to find profound meaning in this film are left to string together fuzzy , lofty-sounding cliches and platitudes ( `` tragic '' `` lost soul '' or `` free spirit '' who `` lived in the moment '' and `` followed her instincts , '' `` did not allow herself to be loved , '' `` did not know what 'true love ' was , '' with `` so much 'artificial love ' surrounding her '' ; `` too beautiful to die , too wild to live '' ; `` take nothing for granted , '' `` strive for your dreams and follow your heart , '' `` you can never love or forgive your children enough , '' `` money does not make a person happy , '' `` we all want mainly to be loved and accepted '' ) and to coast on the extreme , sensationalistic events of the model 's life . Some make vast pretensions for the movie ( that it itself does not make , much less deliver on ) , building up a heroine or martyr and sketching a morality play that blames everyone and everything else for what happened to her , while asking no hard questions about her own willful qualities and responsibility for her own behavior . The claims of deep meaning come across as shallow glorification of physical beauty , of tempestuousness , or of a glamorous , sensuous image for their own sake or as sheer sentimentality for a supposedly pathetic , helpless victim.Ironically , all of the mindless emoting , adulation , even idolatry by those claiming to know , admire , or adore this woman through this essentially superficial movie -- just as surely as her supposed exploitation in her chosen career -- risks again reducing her , now in death , to a flat , one-dimensional , token figure being grabbed at by the masses ( as fallen physical beauty , force of nature , glossy image , or victim ) . And if that does not diminish her as a whole human being , it may merely lavish undeserved attention and acclaim on a person of little or no substance ( mired in what is presented as near-total confusion about who she was , what she wanted , and what she cared about , combined with non-stop destructive , thrill-seeking , instant-gratification behavior ) . The hollowness at the core of this film , of its subject , and of so much of this site 's commentary about it is as troubling as the events depicted .	-1
If you are looking for a Jack Russell terrior to star in a cowboy-fast-action-giddy-up movie , this is not it . This movie will be going to my local thrift store to be donated .	-1
Although I love and appreciate Daniel Day Lewis and his talents , I did not enjoy this movie at all because it is dark and weird . I gave it to my library !	-1
The movie was well done . No question about that . I tried watching it but found it so depressing that I had to stop watching . I have enough negativity in my life without adding to it .	-1
On a nostalgia kick recently , I stocked up on several martial arts thrillers I loved ten years or so back , including this little stinker , KICKBOXER.An early Van Damme flick , this followed the superior ( as I recall - I 'm no longer willing to refresh my memory ) BLOODSPORT released one year earlier , and the & quot ; plot & quot ; is the cookie-cutter revenge for maimed/killed relative standard for this genre and , because all anyone watching this wants is the action , that is easily overlooked . Still , the screenplay is SO bad , it is hard to sit through the slow bits ( and there are a lot ) to get to the fight scenes . The acting is just plain terrible as well . Van Damme 's acting skills had n't matured ( try not to laugh ) yet and Dennis Alexio 's & quot ; performance , & quot ; even for a non-actor , as Van Damme 's brother is downright painful to watch . The show-stealer here is the largely silent Michel Qissi as Tong Po , radiating real evil . This performance , however , no matter how strong , could not save this film.The big & quot ; final fight , & quot ; as usual is the highlight of this movie , but it 's simply not worth sitting through the terrible soundtrack ( oh my , it 's bad ) , screenplay , and acting to get to it . Still , the film spawned at least four sequels , so perhaps I 'm missing some of the appeal . As far as my hunger for late 80s action cheese , I 'll have to stick with Steven Seagal - KICKBOXER left a bad taste in my mouth . One star because the sixteen year-old in me once found something to love in this movie and one star for Michel Qissi .	-1
You would think that if you put three of the funniest comic actors in a movie you would come up with a howler . This movie should be shown in movie producing classes as a & quot ; bad chemistry & quot ; classic . These guys do n't know what to do with each other . Are they courteously waiting for the other guy to grab the punchline ? Are they busting their reps to push a bad script ? Do they have the flu , or is this a contract fulfillment deal that makes them turn this half witted plot into a dull , pasty , lifeless drone ? I say burn it , and never mention it again .	-1
... but I have loved and read Shakespeare for fifty years . I did so want to love this movie , and based on the two principals , I was thrilled to find and purchase it ! Oh , Goody , I thought ! Celebrated Ian McKellen and `` Chubby little Judy Dench '' How I adore watching them ! And it STANK . It was so nothing -- -so absolutely nothing -- -I was not in any way moved throughout the production except to stifle my gag reflexes each time the cast 's apparent obsession with drooling was indulged . And finally , I was moved to turn off the set a few minutes after MacDuff 's pretty chicken and its dam were snuffed . I did n't CARE that they were snuffed -- -they were stupid , uncaring , lifeless and boring . I really , really hated this production . Hated it . Boring , Boring , Boring . You 'd think , given the parts , that the whole could not have been BORING -- -but it is . Imagine MacBeth performed by the worst community theatre group you 've ever been subjected to , but they are all tanked up on valium . No , that 's too entertaining . You CA N'T imagine it . Do n't try . Steer clear .	-1
Not exaclty what I had wanted for my high school class . It was a bit too sophisticated and did not have the colorful and vivid quality so craved by high school students . I would recommend it , though , for junior college and for serious Shakespere fans .	-1
This is not an inditement of the movie but of the man . Harry Truman was the absolute worst president this country as ever had to endure . One of his first actions was to join the KKK in Missouri in order to become affiliated with the foremost political machine in the state . Once he made it to national office , he no longer considered himself a member as he did not need the KKK . What actually makes him the worst president is that he gave all of eastern Europe to the Soviet Union . The allies had just fought a war in order , partially , to keep Europe from being conquered by Nazi Germany . However , Truman just gave all of eastern Europe to the Soviet Union without a shot being fired . His best military leader , General Patton saw the threat from the Soviet quite clear . General Patton wanted to march straight through Germany to protect eastern Europe . Unfortunately , Truman , who knew absolutely about military tactics , disagreed to venomously with Patton that he relieved Patton of his command . A few years later , the same scenario was played out again in the Korean conflict . General MacArthur , knowing that the war could not be won on the ground , wanted to bomb North Korea and China with 30 to 50 atom bombs . Again , Truman , who still knew absolutely about military tactics , relieved General MacArthur of his command and the war was lost . Harry Truman was the reason the United States was involved in the cold war . If he had done what his military experts had wanted to do , there would have been no Soviet Union , Communist China , Communist North Korea or Communist Cuban . Harry Truman was the Communists ' best friend .	-1
It 's called `` the world 's greatest fashion show '' by people who do n't want to admit that they 're waiting for the actors to undress.Some say it 's about human relations . No , it is n't . It 's about sex.Still others have dubbed it `` feminist '' . Come on , you do n't really think feminist activists are watching this trash , are you ? Even from a sexist angle , the show is a failure . I mean , the women in the show are ugly . Especially Carrie . Curiously , some of the men are more good-looking ! Not to mention the trannies.The only positive thing one could say about `` Sex and the City '' is that with this original , you really do n't need the parodies .	-1
We 've seen this before , a bunch of guys sittin ' around talkin ' about how they & quot ; scored & quot ; last night . Each guy 's diatribe leads into a scene displaying the described mattress mambo . Except it 's not guys this time . That 's really the only difference . Sure there is more whining and talk about & quot ; relationships & quot ; but its the same old hoochie-koochie in a different dress.So I say rent some porn instead . Porn is cheaper , the acting is sometimes better than in this show , it 's more honest and the & quot ; payoff & quot ; is greater .	-1
I ca n't return this item cause i 'm in south america and i supposed it would be expensive but this dvd looks dark , all pixelated and does n't have spanish subtitles	-1
Allegedly comic adventures of fluff-brained magazine writer and her ghastly friends on the search for a trophy husband in the ritzier neighborhoods of New York . The cast includes such likeable people as Sarah Jessica Parker , Kim Cattrall , and Chris Noth , but they are playing the sort of yuppie scum who should be sterilized at birth , lest they reproduce . I 'm not even sure that this film could speak to real-life yuppie scum -- even they have a greater capacity for love than this crew . . .	-1
i remember seeing this movie a long long time ago ... this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen .	-1
Let 's get something straight , my pee-peeing fans : Stallone was NOT trying to follow in Arnold 's footsteps with his comedies of the early '90s . He was RETURNING to a genre that he dabbled in before Arnie became known as a comedic screen presence . Remember 1984 's `` Rhinestone '' ? That was a genuinely funny musical-comedy that Stallone co-wrote . Why did it bomb at the box office ? Your guess is as good as mine - I think that the critical buzz ( which was bad ) helped kill the film . But that 's beside the point , which is that Sly had already proven comedic acting chops well in advance of `` Stop or My Mom Will Shoot '' and the previous year 's farcical `` Oscar . `` Another myth to dispel : people claim that this movie was a commercial failure . Not true , dear readers . While it may have only grossed $ 28 million domestically ( which is actually around the 40 million mark when adjusted for inflation ) , this rather modestly-budgeted film was a considerable money-maker internationally ( which was where Mr. Stallone 's bread was buttered for most of the '90s ) . Why did it do middling box office here in the states ? Honestly , the pairing of Sly and 'Golden Girl'Estelle Getty - though comedically inspired and full of potential - was not smart demographically speaking . How many Sly 's action fanbase were going to take something like this seriously ? Conversely , how many grannies ( i.e . the majority of 'Golden Girls ' fans ) were going to go see a loud , brash action-comedy ( featuring a certain amount of violence and bad language ) ? Neither of the stars ' fanbase were on board.So what does that leave us with ? A strangely unengaging hybrid - most of the jokes fall flat , and most of the action sequences feel generic and TV-movieish . Yes , you 'll laugh at the sight of Sly in a diaper ( during a nightmare sequence ) but you 'll groan at the sight of Estelle trying to wash her son 's gun with standard household cleaning products . One great line : Estelle 's infamous one-liner to her son : `` Go ahead - make your bed . `` The DVD is surprisingly robust , all things considered . The movie is presented in a very attractive widescreen transfer , along with a couple of bonus features . There is a short - but very entertaining - behind-the-scenes featurette . Yes , it 's a fairly typical EPK puff piece , but there is some amusing footage of Getty and Stallone clowning together . Also included is an intriguing alternate ending . I say intriguing because it is clearly taken from an even longer sequence of deleted scenes ( not included on the dvd ) , since on it 's own it barely makes any sense . Still interesting to see , because the third act of this movie apparently was originally much different ( and more action-oriented ) . I only wish that more deleted footage had been included .	-1
The plot of this movie is very simple ( and rather stupid ) ; come up with an excuse for the young babes to show off their beautiful bodies . To correct the top reviewer - Betsy Russell does not ride a horse bare back ; the horse had a saddle ( and who would care anyway ) . Betsy Russell rides the horse TOPLESS . And as well endowed as she is , there is definitely a lot of bouncing . There is also a shower scene later in the movie that provides a whole group of young babes the opportunity to show how beautiful they are .	-1
I was unaware that it was a Region 2 ; therefore , I 've been unable to check the quality . : ( I 'm bummed	-1
This is one of the films that so badly fails to come together that it is laughable . For my daughter 's education , I needed to find a film on immigration to America in the 19C , and this was in a discount collection we had bought in Ireland of all places . For whatever reason , it appears to me that this brought out the worst in everyone involved : Tom Cruise , Nicole Kidman , and Ron Howard - all of whom I think are truly fine talents - are simply awful for the stupidest story imaginable . Ron Howard , who inhabits a light-hearted universe and does so very well , tried to make a kind of serious comedy . Big mistake . Cruise , who I think is under-rated as an actor , is somehow off-key in this , like he is barely trying to get it right . Even the beautiful and charismatic Kidman is flat in this , in a ridiculous part of an aristocrat wanting to become an American . Not only is the story outlandishly unrealistic and stupidly romantic , but the theme of `` great leveling '' on coming to the promised land is heavy handed and lacks subtlety.Not recommended . This fails from the first second and is a chore to sit through , right to the first kiss after Cruise returns from death for love .	-1
Viewed : 8/12Rate : 48/12 : Lawrence of Arabia is clocked at 228 minutes . The Godfather is clocked at 178 minutes . Mutinty on the Bounty ( 1962 ) is clocked at 132 minutes . Scent of a *ussy is clocked at 157 minutes . Now , I can stand the running times of the first three and do not complain because they are epic pictures . However , Scent of a *ussy is almost three freaking hours long and is not even an epic ! While watching it , I constantly asked myself , `` How much longer is this going to be ? '' It 's usually over 90 minutes to go . My goodness ... the scenes could have been cut out , and it wo n't make a difference in the overall story . Think of all of the films that Al Pacino is famous for : The Godfather , Serpico , The Godfather Part II , Dog Day Afternoon , Scarface , Carlito 's Way , and Glengarry Glen Ross . Now , how many Oscars has he won for them ? Zero . And he freaking won it for Scent of a *ussy ? ? ? This worthless piece of crap ? ? ? He actually won the thing for this stupid piece of tripe ? ? Notice the last word in the title Scent of a *ussy . It is what exactly the film is all about : whether it 's Charlie or the women ; makes no difference to me . The moments are so unrealistic that they will never happen in real life . Charlie goes to New York City after agreeing to do a simple caretaker job for the weekend ? Will never happen . He is too much of a wimp to do anything . After so long , Charlie is willing to take verbal abuse and be ordered around by Frank like that ? Will never happen . The woman accepts the offer to tango and be watched by everybody else in the fancy restaurant ? Will never happen . Too damn embarrassing for her . Frank goes to his brother 's house and takes control of the dinner while his relatives stand for it ? Will never happen . Realistically , he would have been forbidden to step in the house at the outset . Remember Charlie staying in the limo and waiting on Frank while he has fun with a hooker in her apartment ? Pretty insulting , is it ? Now , now ... why would Charlie want to give up his life ? Why does he care whether Frank wants to kill himself or not ? Good riddance , if I must say ... and to end the film faster . The reason why I stayed to the end is because I wanted to see what happened in the kangaroo court apropos of Charlie 's fate . It turns out to be a neutral result : nobody got found out or was punished . Useless ordeal , if you must ask me . That scene where Frank gives his profanity laced speech ? Will never happen . In fact , in reality , after the first word is uttered , the speech will end , and Frank will be escorted out after being discredited . Al Pacino gave a better speech in City Hall which was very classy , Al Pacino-like . Hearing why he became blind , I presume reasonably that Frank is dismissed ( a.k.a dishonorably discharged ) and ca n't be referred to as the lieutenant colonel anymore . Henceforth , he is ineligible for disability checks and VA benefits . And if he allowed himself saluted as the colonel , then he would have forced by honor to correct the reference , but it 's moot already . All in all , I want to you imagine Al Pacino with the eyes all bugged out of his lizard face ... inhaling deeply ... hands on the table : that 's the film Scent of a *ussy .	-1
I finally watched this after hearing about it for years and finally seeing the first half hour on network television . Most of the film is genuinely entertaining , if a bit far-fetched and downright ridiculous at times , but with good acting , touching moments and sensitivity to real issues of manhood and growing up . All the merits , however , seem obliterated by the ending , with its message of condemnation for potential whistleblowers : See No Evil . The statement seems emblematic of society in decline . Is there no place for those who would take a moral stand under pressure ? When does group acceptance trump accountability and conscience ?	-1
It was a hard movie to understand where it was heading , I love Sean Connelly that is why I watched it , He did play a small part .	-1

A painstakingly unwatchable bunch of scratch about a radio station that has management members dropping like flies on the station 's debut night . The murders are the most ridiculously old and obsolete things : some uninvited voice on an intercom says a rhyme and someone dies shortly after . A bunch of these in addition to bull about showing radio commercials and more bull about a husband and ex-wife both working at the same station , both looking to get back together . All the jokes are baby jokes : a guy slips and falls , a guy gets thrown out of a room , or someone shuts the door on a guy . HORRIBLE	-1
William Sadler ( Tv 's Roswell , Die Hard 2 ) stars as Brayker ... a man on the run from Cowboy Billy Zane ( Silver City , Zoolander ) who just happens to be The Collector and he wants what Sadler has in his possesion ... an ancient relic with blood in it from Jesus Christ and Sadler is looking for the next person to pass it on to fend off the demons . Sadler gets the help from Willy , played by Dick Miller and they go to a shelter run by actress CCH Pounder ( Face/Off ) ... her , a smart talking black girl played by Jada Pinkett Smith ( Matrix Revolutions and Reloaded ) , a fired mail man played by Charles Fleischer ( Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? ) , a horny girl , played by Brenda Bakke ( Under Siege 2 ) who Fleischer is in love with but she 's with Roach , played by Thomas Haden Church ( Sideways , Rolling Kansas ) . Zane and the cops come along ... Bob The Cop is played by actor Gary Farmer ( Dead Man , Smoke Signals ) . Zane then kills the sheriff by putting his hand threw his head and creates demons of the knight . Sadler and the crew hold them back and try to survive the night . Will Zane get what he wants ? Will Sadler pass on the tradition ? Well , if you 've watched this you already know . Billy Zane keeps the movie from being a total disaster ... .he gives the role of The Collector a witty humor masked by his devilish deeds , manipulating the people inside to get what he wants . Sadler comes close but no cigar and Jada Pinkett Smith is miscast . John Larroquette ( Tv 's Night Court ) appears in the beginning in a cameo . Gory , yeah ... .corny , yes but with Zane and his wacky performance ... it makes it a medicore horror movie	-1
IM SORRY , WHOEVER GAVE THIS MOVIE 4 AND A HALF STARS IS JUST DESPERATE AND WILL LAUGH AT ANY STUPID THING OUT THERE ...

OK , THERE ARE A FEW MOMENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN OK , BUT THE WHOLE MOVIE BECAME SO LAME , THAT THE FEW FUNNY AREAS CANT CARRY THE REALLY DUMB PARTS..SAVE YOUR MONEY..UNLESS YOU ARE 15 , THIS MOVIE IS JUST DUMB..NO , DUMBER..THAN ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE	-1
I have not yet viewed this product , so can not judge it . I only gave one star as it is still an unknown . I enjoyed the movie as a young person , that 's why I wanted to view it again . Memory is not sharp , looking back 65 years .	-1

I have invested , over and over again ( I guess I should have learned by now ) in DVDs that were eventually rereleased in so-called `` Special Editions '' -- the list is long.Now , I have n't seen this version ( at the time I 'm writing this , it has n't been released ) , but I did buy the LAST `` Special Edition '' of 'Jaws ' . Little did I know that it was n't the REAL `` Special Edition '' .I guess the studios think we 're all stupid . Perhaps we are . After all , we end up shelling out the extra cash to buy the latest edition . Here 's an idea : let 's stop buying initially released films on DVD . Let 's wait a year or two for a `` Special Edition '' .The most recent egregious example was `` Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind '' . It was released in a single disc edition , only to be released again a few MONTHS later in a two-disc edition . Of course , I 'd already bought the first disc . Scandalous ! Please stop , studios . We all know you 're losing money , but that 's because of the overall poor quality of your product . Stop sticking it to those of us that are the biggest movie fans -- those of us that are creating a DVD library . It really needs to stop . `` Jaws '' gets 4.5 stars . Studio money-grubbing gets zero stars.Edited to respond to those who say `` get over it '' . Sorry , not made of money . I would love to have every single version available . Calling me cheap is wrong and silly . Why not debate the facts rather than resort to name calling ?	-1
WHY do they edit out scenes from the VHS version ? ? ? .I was watching and I have seen this movie on tape alot of times ... and I said something 's MISSING ? ? ? ... well it 's all in the `` BONUS FEATURES '' ...

I am SO mad about this..who am I gon na fight ? ? ? `` CITY HALL '' forget it ! ! ... JUST get the tape & do NOT throw out your tape machine yet , cause I 've heard they did this on another movie I bought ( forget which one ) ..I gave the tape away already	-1
The basic premise of this is a good one , a crime editor racing to solve a murder where the clues all point to him . Too bad this film fails in the execution of this premise . The direction seems stilted , the delivery by the actors is so bland . The only performer who distinguishes themself here is Elsa Lanchester as the eccentric artist . It may be sacrilege , but the remake of this film , `` No Way Out '' is far superior to the original . It was sexually charged ( impossible for production code days ) and had your heart racing throughout the various plot machinations .	-1
A disjointed , lesser noir flick , featuring Charles Laughton as an all-powerful publishing magnate who seeks to pin a murder he committed onto one of his trusted employees . Ray Milland plays the clever editor slated to take the fall ; the film flounders as Milland makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake : getting drunk with his boss ' mistress , lying to his wife about his whereabouts and generally blundering about making things worse . The growing pile of evidence against him is meant to ratchet up the suspense , but the direction and script are both so poor that the story just seems preposterous and never picks up speed . Laughton 's performance is adequate , Milland is a bit irritating . Elsa Lanchester has a supporting role as a kooky modern artist , and a young Henry Morgan ( later known as Colonel Potter on TV 's `` MASH '' ) plays a silent hired thug . Skippable .	-1
Great movie , I have not seen this in years and wish I could see it now ! This dvd will not play on my player .	-1
I love Peter Jackson and Michael J . Fox but this is just awful because it 's done by these two . What a disappointment . It 's disjointed and overblown with effects , a visual trick used by directors to cover lack of story , script , what ? This is Peter Jackson ! and there 's an interesting story , interesting characters and it still does n't work . It seems it was written and cast when Fox was younger ( like Back to the Future days ) when he could have handled the comedic/ironic lead . Instead there are two movies ; the one with ghosts and effects and then the one with Fox . The story gets going as if the film is headed in one direction then it slows down when Fox comes into scene and the other movie takes over - and seeing as this is basically a comedy , it 's not very funny . ( Jeffrey Combs 's characters are always over the top and comedic in that crazy psycho way which could be another movie in itself ) . There 's no irony in Fox 's treatment of the bungling psychic , no comedy . It 's sad as well that there 's no chemistry between Fox and Lucy - there 's more interest and character development in the two diabolic leads than the heroes . Do n't get me wrong , I wanted to like this film and I was rooting for Michael J. to pull it up out of the quagmire it 's drowning in , but to no avail . I should have minded the other few star reviews .	-1
I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out but remembered nothing at all about it . Now I know why . I can hardly believe that Peter Jackson made this awful mess of a movie . It fails on every level . I only paid $ 3 for the DVD but it was n't even worth it at that price .	-1
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MICHAEL J FOX 'S MIND WHEN HEAGREED TO DO SUCH A TERRIBLE PIECE OF GARBAGE AS THIS ? DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PILE OF YOU KNOW WHAT .	-1
With very few exceptions , movies like `` The Frighteners '' fail at producing a consistent level of horror . Of course , it all depends on what you want out of your movie . For my money , I will just take horror . However , with that being said , I did not find the so-called humor in this movie to be funny at all , so this movie fails in its essential purpose ( s ) in my estimation . I found myself continuously rolling my eyes at the lame and ridiculous attempts at comedy , which is obviously what the movie was after on at least some level.The only movies that I know that are able to produce a horror-comedy hybrid and still maintain some degree of horror to hang its hat on at the end of the day are `` The Evil Dead '' ( the slapstick comedy was annoying at times to me and brought this movie down some ) and `` An American Werewolf in London '' ( which cleverly mixed horror with dark humor successfully and still remained scary ) , both of these movies I like very much . Notwithstanding the effectiveness of `` The Evil Dead '' and `` An American Werewolf in London '' , one of the main problems with films like these is the fact that any horror produced by these types of movies is diluted or diminished , at least to some degree , by the attempt to create comedy . If you find yourself laughing in one scene and being scared in another , it would be successful , but I did not find in myself any identifiable reaction while viewing this film other than disgust at how ridiculous it was . I would argue that the lame attempt to create comedy in the case of `` The Frighteners '' destroys any attempt by the creators of this movie to produce any horror . Admittedly , when you cast Michael J . Fox as the lead character ( while he is a good actor ) , it is obvious you are not going for the effect of `` The Exorcist '' or `` The Shining '' in your movie.With any movie , beauty is in the eye of the beholder , so perhaps some people like this type of so-called horror-comedy hybrid , but I honestly thought this movie was a horrible comedy with essentially ZERO horror .	-1
Liar Liar had some good acting by Jim Carrey but - to me , as bizarre as it will no doubt seem to some - the use of religious profanity ( specifically , taking the holy Name of The Lord God Almighty in vain ) ruined it for me .	-1
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SUPER HERO MOVIES EVER MADE . Even Remo Williams was better . At least Remo Williams had some humor and heart.BATMAN BEGINS SEEMS LIKE RIP OFF OF THIS MOVIE , BUT SO MUCH BETTER . If you have seen Batman Begins , you have seen this movie . A guy living in the underworld in some Asian mountains find the light with a guru . He returns to the big city as a rich playboy and fights crime . He ends up fighting those who trained under the same guru . Although The Shadow did it first , and Batman Begins is a copycat , Batman Returns is a much better movie.I really like Alec Baldwin , but in this movie , he is a cardboard character . How he turns from bad to good is never shown , it just happens . He really does n't show any emotion during the whole movie . He is a lot like the character he makes fun of in 30 Rock.Not much is done with the concept of The Shadow . There is one short episode near the beginning of the movie tha shows what The Swhadow is all about , but it is n't very thrilling or interesting . He just captures some criminals on a bridge , but there is no background to draw you into the story.After that , it is more a supernatural story , and not much to do with The Shadow . A much better movie would have been to explore more about The Shadow , just like Batman Begins gives you a rich story about Batman , who he was and how he fought crime . But , it also gives you a backgrind story about the criminals he fights so there is tension.The love story in this movie is also very weak.This movie was killed by critics and was a bomb at the box office . But , sometimes the critics can be wrong and the movie fans might miss a winner . You can decide if you want to take the chance .	-1
I really liked the movie , even when it got too thin in the script department . The production was slick and maintained my interest during the whole movie . It is relatively short , and would be good at a party . Just do n't expect the script quality of a Tim Burton 's Batman movie.The downside is that the DVD conversion was not that good . For example , I noticed that the French version had better visual quality than the English version , like during the intro , when the title & quot ; The Shadow & quot ; appears . I think this DVD is a direct-from-VHS copy . Not the best of all methods ! The features are quite limited . It is not even widescreen . No extra footage ... Frankly , you are better of buying the VHS version of this movie .	-1
This film , which was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 1995 , is fabulous , on both the DVD and DVD-DTS versions now available.But why in the world would Universal Home Video take one of its golden movies from its great library and slap it onto a DVD in a full aspect ratio ( TV Land ) format ? The video and audio quality are terrific . Otherwise , the & quot ; no-widescreen & quot ; decision does n't make sense at all.Is this a & quot ; trend & quot ; adopted by some home video divisions at the studios in California to accommodate the still larger group of non-purists who prefer seeing movies in the dumb pan and scan or what I laughably call the & quot ; HBO format ? & quot ; Go over to AMC and Turner Classic Movies on cable and the trend over there , for people who are movie purists , is in a completely opposite direction . More of their films are being shown on cable in the widescreen format. & quot ; Babe & quot ; is the second major crtically acclaimed Universal studio release on DVD that is being offered without the widescreen format . The other , and you 'll choke on this when you hear this , is & quot ; The Sting , & quot ; the intricate & quot ; con & quot ; film that WON the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1973.Even more puzzling is Universal Studio 's decision to release the sequel , & quot ; Babe : A Pig in the City , & quot ; which was little seen in theaters , in full widescreen format on DVD.Why widescreen on one and not the other ? I could understand it if the studio released information indicating to consumers that the awful 1:33:1 aspect ratio ( the 35mm norm for nearly all films released in the United States before 1953 ) was the original theatrical issue , but I do n't believe this was the case for 1995 's masterful & quot ; Babe. & quot ; Another atrocious miscue by another company , is being commited by Fox Video for its DVD version of Alan Parker 's gloriously intoxicating film , & quot ; The Commitments , & quot ; another film that deserves the widescreen treatment and not crummy pan and scan.Please , fellow Amazonians out there , get on the bandwagon and clamor for the studios , at the very least , to offer both formats on DVD , and not one at the exclusion of the other ! This is the way most of the major DVD releases are done right now anyway ( widescreen on side A and pan and scan on side B ) .Perhaps Universal 's handling of & quot ; Babe & quot ; was to cater to the & quot ; kiddie crowd. & quot ; But that 's insulting if the film 's popularity had n't crossed over to adults , it would n't have made as much money as it did and just as important , it would not have been nominated for Best Picture in 1995.But the lack of a widescreen DVD for & quot ; Babe & quot ; is truly , truly a puzzle , a riddle , a baffling decision by Universal . I can think of no acceptable explanation other than they did n't want to spend the money to treat one of its gems on DVD the way it treated it for the currently available widescreen version of & quot ; The Sting & quot ; on VHS . Does anyone at Universal/MCA at Universal City , California have an answer that makes sense ? This is truly a travesty for DVD fans !	-1
Apollo 13 has been so overpraised as a film even the evil Newt Gingrich would like it 's hard to buck the trend , but here goes : As one of the Apollo moon mission junkies I saw this one on its release and was disappointed . Instead of the profound experience I expected of man going to the moon I got some jokes about the constellation Urine , some lines like , `` Mommy , you 're squishing me '' , and family scenes so schmaltzy they are practically unwatchable.The film should be considered well done except for these family scenes which dumb it down so much.To me the Apollo missions are mankind 's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience . I hope man one day returns to the moon and onto Mars instead of spending trillions of dollars on war . I recommend an excellent , but hard to get documentary on Apollo 11 called , `` Moonwalk One '' that 's shown sometimes on NASA TV .	-1
All the below being true , I believe I 'll just stick with my clunky old Apollo DVD until I hear that those high-placed studio clowns have reattached their heads in the right direction .	-1
When I received this movie the date for utilizing the so called `` Digital Copy '' had expired . Why they have expiration dates at all is beyond my comprehension.The movie takes forever to start . When you select a given chapter you are presented with a commercial for social media . Very difficult to navigate this disc.Obviously , the movie itself is good . However , the presentation , marketing , and embedded advertising massively distracts from this otherwise fine motion picture.Hopefully , the upcoming movie `` Man Conquers Space '' will be better .	-1
At first , my Sherwood 5004 blu-ray player hooked to the BD-Live function played this blu-ray , but only intermittently . Today , when I found that my Panasonic BD-35 had a new firmware update , I tried the blu-ray on it and it worked.What did I find after a very anxious and lengthy wait ? It seems that Universal wants me to see little blurbs of their upcoming movie attractions on the top right of the screen across from the top menu choices ( play , chapters , special features , set up , et al . ) So I am forced ( not given a choice as to whether I connect to BD-Live ) to download the BD Live stuff as the disc boots up . They indicate this on a short flash screen during the interminable upload but reward me by telling me that the content is constantly updated.Whoopee ! I do not like a studio forcing me to wait for load of drivel that I do n't care to watch ( also think of the Fox , Disney and Lions Gate interminable trailers ) that I will not watch/do everything to avoid watching and would prefer the blu-ray to start with the movie as Warner Bros is decent enough to do.Whatever idiot at Universal originated this concept should be bounced out the door ASAP . ( Of course , having worked in management I can just visualize the execs . sitting around the table as some young , eager man or woman comes up with this marketing ploy to push other product - he or she probably got a big bonus , can you imagine that ? ) He or she obviously has no regard for customers and customers do drive the whole machine , now do n't they ? This download took longer to load than my first blu-ray machine did for Disney features in the early days of blu-ray and that is saying something . I told my wife this was the `` Great Leap Backwards . '' ( I do hope my Chinese friends will forgive me for this bit of grim humor . ) In disgust , I disconnected the Panasonic blu-ray player from my network adapter and guess what , the movie started right away . So did the Sherwood ! Hurray for BD Live , the epitome of high technology ! I do wonder why my machines played when so many others reported theirs would not . Universal has some problems here , that is obvious . My Panasonic was just updated and would not play the disc until it was updated . My Sherwood had some problems but it is less than a year old . Perhaps anything that new can play the disc . It is possible that Universal is using some form of Disc Protection similar to that being used on many discs by Fox ( copyright encryption ) that has given many problems on Avatar - but I really do n't know , other than having heard that Fox is really into protecting their properties . I read that it took all of two weeks for the criminals to break that encryption . Of course , consumers will be living with discs that work poorly for many years.It is so sad to ruin the experience when the content , Apollo 13 is such a splendid example of the medium.It is disconcerting to consider that the best way to run blu-ray discs may be off-line , without access to the BD Live features , which the industry touts so strongly . But it does avoid wasting time in start-up and the dubious BD Live features that are often fluff or content light . A five minute wait for a 45 second semi-high def . simply is n't worth it to me , even if the content is of some nominal value.Who knows , maybe someday there will blu-ray standards that survive more than a year without wholesale changes , perhaps the manufacturers will understand that the players are used by people who are not engineers , and should not require constant firmware updates , and , in a perfect world , it is possible that the studios will learn that customers just want discs that play each time they put them in , quickly , reliably and with quality commentary or special features . Those features matter matter more than whether they are via BD Live or from the disc itself.Perhaps , but then it 's more likely that you 'll run across Santa . If you do tell him I said hello .	-1
The first half-hour of the movie opens strong . We are presented with Kevin Costner 's strong , rogue character who does n't take anything from anybody . He 's strong as both a character and Costner himself pulls off the job superbly . And then comes the action ! GREAT stunts and special effects ! And the movie is accompanied by a superb score by wizard James Newton Howard . But , then the middle comes : Dennis Hopper ( one of my least favorite actors ) appears as the bad guy , the lady ( whatever her name is ) shows not only her bad acting skills but her completely cheesy character . The little girl is bearable , but still unnecessary.As far as costumes , action , and music go , this movie is pretty good . You wo n't find much better for shear scale of action ! But , as far as story , plot , dialogue , and acting ( except for Costner ) goes , this movie leaves you wishing it were something more . The ending is bad and sappy and towards the middle the movie slows down almost to a snails pace and begins to do nothing more than bore the heck out of the viewer with ridiculous and unnecessary additions to the already paper-thin story ( the crazy seamen who will trade his maps to Costner just for a half hour of sex with the woman was stupid , stupid , stupid ) .All in all , rent this on DVD once and if you like it , fine . But , my opinion stands . This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen in my entire life . Avoid buying it at ALL costs .	-1
Kevin Costner 's multi-million dollar rip-off of the & quot ; Road Warrior. & quot ; Pretty much the same plot and theme except on water as opposed to desert.Kevin Costner plays a fish-human hybrid wandering in a world now covered with water . He runs into Helen ( Jeanne Tripplehorn ) and a young girl ( Tina Majorino ) but soon realizes they bring trouble with the Smokers , a band of cigarette-smoking pirates led by The Deacon ( Dennis Hopper . ) Grudgingly protecting the innocent peoples from the Smokers , Costner then seeks to lead them to a solid ground paradise.The movie 's credit goes to the stunt personnel who did all the show . In terms of solid lines and performances there are none except for Dennis Hopper . The story itself reeks of pseudo science and shows the writer 's obvious lack of basic georgraphical knowledge . Even if the polar caps had completely melted , it is impossible for that amount of water to rise over 30,000 feet evenly across the entire world : sorry Mr. Costner , there just is n't that much ice in the polar caps and our water supply on this planet is a closed system.The movie is just another sad example of Costner 's ever declining career as both an actor and director . I kept on wanting to fall asleep through the film but the explosions and senseless yelling kept me awake .	-1
I love Kevin Costner , but could not get into this movie . I know it did n't do well at the box office , but t hought I 'd check it out being such a huge Kevin Costner fan .	-1
Just a few words about the cover art for this DVD ; Compare it to the sober , tasteful , esthetic , and mystic cover artwork for the import edition , DUNA . ( Referring to `` Dune Definitive Collection 2 DVD Set [ Import ] ( 1984 ) '' with the blue moons . ) This US edition is a typical example of what happens when producers are in charge , and always have the final word . Their goal is foremost to sell and make as much money as possible ; not to make an esthetically pleasing product . In Hollywood they are often speculative hustlers , as opposed to real Artists . Here they have squeezed in as much information as possible into the picture ; all characters are crammed in . Details all over the picture . It 's just chaotic and ugly . Unbalanced.It 's the same thing with the new Star Wars films packages . The foremost thought and motivation is to sell . ( But of course , at the same time there are great artists who have contributed to these films ! People who manage to present their visions , untainted by producers ' restless clumsy hands . But that is another matter . ) Things were better when the artists themselves were in charge of design , before the commercially speculative producers took over everything around the early 1980s or thereabout .Edit : P.S . To all of you who have given negative feedback to this review : You simply do n't understand how fooled you are by the commercialized film industry ! It 's a sad state to see the large masses being brainwashed .	-1
I have to give some credit to Lynch 's & quot ; Dune & quot ; - the movie did have wonderful special effects , especially for 1984 . But can special effects make a movie out of such an intricate and detailed novel as Frank Herbert 's & quot ; Dune & quot ; ? No way . First of all , whoever decided to butcher the book down into a two-hour movie was a moron . There is no way you can tell Herbert 's story in two hours . The beginning of Lynch 's & quot ; Dune & quot ; is excellent ; while omitting ample detail , as anybody would have to , Lynch still stays true . Once Paul and Jessica travel into the desert , however , the movie takes a plundering drop down hill . It did n't even make sense to me , someone who has read the original & quot ; Dune & quot ; several times . What Herbert took 300 pages to tell ( the last half of the book ) , Lynch does in 30 minutes . By the end , I was so disgusted I was nearly cheering for the Boron . It was repulsive.Speaking of the Boron , why did Lynch feel the need to change his character so much ? The warts did n't held , okay , Mr. Lynch ? Neither did making him look like a complete buffoon who ca n't add 2 plus 2 . I could go on and on , but I wo n't ... ... If you 're a & quot ; Dune & quot ; fan , you 're going to see this movie no matter what I say . Please do n't expect much , though .	-1
I bought this DVD thinking I would see all that I saw so many years ago in the movie theatre ... The best scenes are edited out , for example the scene where Baron Harkonnen pulls the heart plug on a captive then takes a blood shower - that got cut . Guess someone was offended to see an evil character doing something evil . LOTS of the best scenes are cut . This `` extended edition '' is just a lot of trash picked up off the cutting room floor.If you still want to buy this DVD , save some money and I will send you my own ( played only one time ) DVD , just cover my postage cost . It is NOT worth owning .	-1
My negative comments are on THIS version of the movie , not the story itself or the origional 2hr release of the movie . As with all negative comments left , I 'm sure I 'll get some negative feedback on this review . . .but here goes nothin : So . . .as a BIG fan of of the original trilogy and Lynch 's version of the movie I had to watch the recent release of the Extended version of Dune.I heard the original movie had six hours that was cut down to the original release of just over two hours . So when the three hour version came out I anticipated great things . . . but was let down.For someone who has never read the book the first thirty minutes adds additional narriation and character introduction to get one understanding who the players of the story are . Fine . But , for those of us familiar with the story , the extra drawings and narrations are n't of any additional benefit and thus most of the extra 40 minutes of footage is wasted on this portion of the movie.Some scenes the narriation broke the pace of the scene letting the scene seem dull and flat . For example , when we are first introduced to Paul while his three mentors walk into the room the narriation breaks the scene to introduce each of the three mentors . A great ploy to get any newbie acquaintd to the story of Dune but the pace of the scene was dramatically interrupted to do so . Just did n't work for me.Other scenes that were included in the original release are changed . Dialogue either cut or edited differently , thus if the viewer if familiar with the orginal release the scene leaves the viewer with a sense of wrongness.For example , the Baron never spits in Lady Jessica 's face , the scene is highly altered in this version leaving it seemingly dull and sensless for what little there was of it.Another example , we are n't prepared for Chani 's introduction via Paul 's visions as in the previous release . So when he meets her in real life and says `` Oh , the woman of my dreams , '' we do n't get the connection because one has n't been strongly established , thus their growing love is not believable in this version.So down with the complaining , what did I like about this version ? There were some fun extra scenes though . For example Gurney as a troubador quotes some poetry as he is assigned a task by the Duke . When he leaves everyone is laughing at Gurney 's dramatics . This was a nice touch into the character of Gurney . Also we get to see them milking the young worm for the Water of Life . Another cool scene.OVERALL : Even with the few apprecaited extra scenes overall I think this version is far inferior to the 2+ hour version . Read the book , watch the original release and enjoy , but only die hard fans need even bother with a rental if they must see something different .	-1
I can sum up my critique of DUNE with a mere three words : do n't watch it.There are a number of marvelous things in this movie , but they are few enough to count , and each positive is ridiculously topped by a host of failures . Francesca Annis , Sian Phillips , Sting , and Linda Hunt are at worst interesting , at best quite good ; the rest of the huge cast , with Kyle MacLachlan a case in point , is about as exciting as trailer park garage sale furniture . The art designs are interesting ; the special effects , however , are ludicrously bad beyond all description . But the core problem is the script.The novel is largely unfilmable , and unless you 've actually read it ( and I recommend it ; it is an extraordinary work ) you 'll never be able to discern what is supposed to be going on . And & quot ; supposed to be going on & quot ; is a key phrase , for the very little that could be successfully transferred from the book actually was . If you 're masochistic enough to actually want to sit through this extremely long , ponderous , self-important , and largely unintelligible movie , do yourself a favor and either catch it on the late-late show or rent it from your favorite video store when they have a dollar-day . At least that way you wo n't kick yourself for having wasted too much money .	-1
Okay , first and foremost , this review has to be done now , cause by tomorrow the approximate hour that I saw of this film , willmore than likely have faded from my memory , so lets dive in shall we ? So from the get go , I knew people where divided in terms of critical analysis about this movie , whichto me spelled `` It 'll either be really good , or really bad '' , and how was it ? To be perfectly honest , the movie did the worst thing to me ; it gave me an awesome lore and expansive universe andinteresting characters in the exposition , that being the first 15-20 minutes of the film , and then , in technical terms , itbait and switches , and the audience is left piecing together a completely and utterly confused mess , which as statedabove is almost four hours long ! I 'm now going to bring up the most logical point in this whole review ; WHY DID N'T THEY JUST SPLIT THE SERIES INTO SEVERAL MOVIES ? Simply put : Books 1-2 ( Movie 1 ) Books 3-4 ( Movie 2 ) Books 5-6 ( Movie 3 ) If they had taken an approach similar to that of `` Star Wars '' ( which had at this point concluded ) , this could have been Hollywood 's next big trilogy.From what i 've heard , the film as a whole is like a `` Best Of Moments and Events '' collection from the Dune universe , and to be completely honest , I can see , with no problems what so ever , why people have said that.Oh yeah , and this movie also has the most contrived final battle i think i 've seen in a while , and to top it off , the ending is WAY to abrupt , almost to a ridiculous degree.David Lynch really rolled the dice on this project ; you wan na see a Director risk it all , this is the film that embodies such action.Believe me , the lore in this story is undeniably badass , but it 's all about execution , something that was absent in this film.Bottom Line Time : The movie is certainly not terrible , but i 'm not going to call it good , so i will saythe film sits idle at a 47 % - Despite a large cast , great sets , and a huge budget , Dune is ambitious , but ultimately incomprehensible , un-engaging , and an adaption that falls short of its epic source material .	-1
Review of the Blu-ray version only ... Is this the best sound they could achieve ? ? I still think the movie is a classic , even though parts of it are laughable now ( acting , smushing an opus book into 2+ hours ) , but the sound is literally tinny , shrill and distorted throughout the movie . I had to turn the volume down constantly in fear of blowing my ( descent ) surround speakers . Newer movie DTS soundtracks sound crisp and clean on my system , this sounded like a shrill garbage disposal . Very , very distracting . The picture quality varied from quite good to grainy with artifacts , but that was acceptable compared to the sound .	-1
I brought Dune and In Harms Way . In harms way is a good movie . I CAN NOT however view Dune . do n't know whats up with that ? ! !	-1
It seems like any sane person could look at Dune , realize there is really no way it could be condensed into a 2 hour format , and wisely shift to another project ... of course , another option is to hire some stars , dump millions of dollars into it , and then cover for the lack of content with a lot of bizzare imagery and suppurating facial boils . Sorry , but I prefer a little content with my special effects ( which are dated now , leaving no further reason to view this stinkburger ) ... how do I know the Baron is evil ? Not because of characterization or plot development , I can tell he 's evil because he floats around killing his minions randomly , he forces his staff to walk around with their ears and eyes sewn shut ( or perhaps this is a fashion statement on his planet ? ) he screams , yells , and sprays spittle every time he delivers a line , and plus his face is sliding off ( man , that cat must be EVIL ! ) . In case this imagery was n't subtle enough , his entire planet is jet black , betraying only a few little angry red cracks ( er , people live here ? ) , and when hankering for a snack , its inhabitants suck the fluids out of little alien fetuses and yank tongues out of cows to eat them raw ( which honestly you should n't do because those things lick their noses , I 've seen them ) . They do this because they 're SO DANG EVIL and these kinds of ploys are a lot easier than actually doing any exposition/character development . This movie would n't draw so much criticism I think if it just had n't been based on Dune because in general the people who liked the book like their material a little smarter than this . Really , best thing for it would have been to dumb it down even more , remove any remaining traces of the political/religeous aspects , replace Kyle Maclaughlin with Jet Li , rename the movie 'Sand Pirates ' then take it out back and set fire to it . Watch the Sci Fi channel 's mini series version ( which is not quite dead on but by God it 's closer than this ) , or read the book again .	-1
This is cinema at it 's worst . If you were to eliminate the narration , the viewer would be clueless as to the `` why '' behind the story events ( unless the viewer already knows the story ) . In this movie the narration is the story and the scenes are like the pictures in a book - only accompaniment to the narration . John Harrison does a far better job of telling the story cinematically in his 2000 TV mini-series . In addition The Children of Dune flows almost seamlessly from Dune .	-1
Dune has to be on the list of one of the worst movies ever made.I would n't accept this movie if someone paid me to take it .	-1
... it makes me wonder what was taking them so long . I can only imagine that it was a legal issue.Now that 's it here , however , I am horrendously disappointed . The previous review claims that it 's `` remastered ? '' Well , the sound may have been `` mixed '' into a 5.1 sound field ( and badly done at that ) , but the picture is still in the same horrific condition as the ORIGINAL DVD release.You do n't have to look any further then the Guild ship landing at the beginning of the movie . Look at the lower left-hand side of the screen and watch the inexplicable shadow artifacts that keep fading in and out ... as if the original film were compromised . No , it 's not one of those `` oh , you really have to look close '' things , either ; it 's actually annoyingly , painfully obvious ! ! You do n't even have to go THAT far to look for transfer problems ! ! Look at the Universal logo on the opening reel and `` oooooo '' and `` ahhhhhh '' at the dust specks and scratches on the film.ALL THIS TIME , and it 's for a film that sports a couple of docs , an extended edition that STILL does n't have completed effects ( you can tell where some of the deleted scenes are without knowing the film that well - the Fremen 's eyes are n't colored in ) , and a release that goes the extra mile to be as cheap as possible by sporting a DOUBLE-SIDED DISC to cut down on manufacturing costs.If you 've already seen the extended release shown on the Sci-Fi channel , base your decision to buy this based on your feelings towards what was shown there because there is no difference here.5 stars for the movie ; 1 star for this release and for Universal making Dune fans froth at the mouth after many inexplicable delays ... for no good reason at all .	-1
Well , to preface this , I like to make a habit of reading older books that have a following , just to see what the hype is about . Especially the ones that have movies made of them . It helps me keep up the the & # 34 ; classics & # 34 ; , if you will , and appreciate the movies on another level.That being said . I have no idea how this movie could ever have worked . I saw this described somewhere else as & # 34 ; A fast paced soundtrack of events for the book & # 34 ; . It would have been virtually impossible to follow without already knowing the story and characters . It was nice on some level to see some of it visualized , but , even for a movie of the 80 's , I was n't impressed . Even the acting was bad and just weird sometimes . But hey , some people loved it and maybe your one of those.I hear there is another take on this as a movie in the near future . I 'm waiting on it . The book has some good potential for a movie .	-1
Dune , people said , was unfilmable . Alexandro Jodorowsky ( El Topo , the Holy Mountain ) and Ridley Scott ( Alien , Blade Runner ) both tried , but failed , to make the movie , unable to raise the massive budgets needed . David Lynch succeeded . Unfortunately.Lynch 's Dune is bedecked with problems . It becomes overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information and the size of the narrative , and Lynch 's attempts to overcome these obstacles are disastrous . He chooses to do FAR too much exposition and character thought & quot ; out loud , & quot ; and the movie feels like a checklist of important plot events from the novel . Lynch fails to characterize anyone but Paul , mistakes Paul for a great hero ( instead of a great leader ) , and apparently kills all the sandworms . ( Water , especially in the massive rainfall at the ending , would do that . ) The love story with Chani and Paul , for instance , is botched into a typical Hollywood auto-love , and characters like Duncan Idaho and Liet Kynes are introduced , seemingly , just to put in an appearance . Paul , and only Paul , is a fairly well-rounded character here.Read the book . This movie 's not worth your time .	-1
I only watched one hour of this movie . After an hour , I stopped it and tossed it into the garbage . It was long enough for me to realize that I just did n't care about the story ; I did n't care about the characters ; I hated the background music ( it was annoying , repetitive -- I 'm sure there was an artsy reason for making it this way ) ; there was not one scene , not one thread in the film that made me want to know what was going to happen . I did n't even think the acting was all that good . I wanted to like this film , but it was just a waste of time .	-1
There 's lots of yakking , and not much attacking.Basically we have a soap opera with a few minutes of giant squid thrown in.If edited down to 30 minutes , it might be watchable.I like bad movies , but not this bad . For a similar movie , but much better done , try watching the new colorized version of `` It came from beneath the Sea '' , with Faith Domergue , a real movie star .	-1
Not only are there no funny moments in this movie , but there are plenty of bizzare and offensive ones . The jokes were n't all that funny back when I first heard them in 5th grade , and they are n't funny now . Flatulence , naughty words for genitalia , frantic screaming for no reason at all , and just some bad dialogue . Strangest was when a dead corpse of the father gets beat up by the son . Is this really funny ? It came off to me as if it was n't even supposed to be funny but that we , the audience were supposed to project all our hate for our fathers onto the screen.All involved with this should hide their heads .	-1
Love this movie , One of my all time favorite disaster movies ! ! ! It arrived promptly , however it did n't work . I tried half a dozen DVD players . Still could n't get to play . I did n't contact the seller .	-1
In a fair world , this film would 've been the biggest flop of Spielberg 's career , but naturally it was n't , because the timing was right . So what 's wrong ? . The characters are boring , the story 's boring , the whole thing is just one big disappointing bore . But why ? . Well , we came to see the creatures , did n't we ? . So where were they ? . The island should 've been full of life , but you did n't get that feeling . It 's almost like Spielberg 's making fun of the audiences who flocked in hordes to the theaters ; giving them suspense but no release . -Or a dino movie with no dinos . Neat . If they were so proud of their CGI effects , why did n't they show us more ? . -Ray Harryhausen at least gave you monster value for your money , with superb stop motion animation for all to SEE . I 'd much rather watch good old stuff like & quot ; King Kong & quot ; , or live lizards in & quot ; Journey To The Center Of The Earth & quot ; , or even those rubber things in & quot ; The Land That Time Forgot & quot ; .	-1
This is about the 3D edition of the movie only , not about the movie itself or previous editions . I have mixed feelings about this particular 3D edition . In geneal , the 3D feeling is not spectacular , yet nice , with rounded edges and lots of volume ; but there are flaws . First of all , there 's far too much ghosting . Second , and most importantly , Universal has done it again ( yes , yet again ! ! ) and has gone too far with the DNR reduction . There is an unfortunate loss of detail ( the previous 2D blu-ray edition is much more detailed ) , all clothes look like they are made of plastic , faces are waxy ( especially middle shots , where they look plain ridiculous ) and the background vegetation often looks like green jelly . This was in a 55 ' Sony TV with active glasses ; maybe smaller screens or passive glasses with diminish these defects . But most of all , this movie was never intended for 3D , so there are no `` on-your-face shocking effects '' or intended use of the environmental 3D either . What was the need of this ? Oh , yes , extra cash on a film already sold in many other different formats , of course . Recommended only for hardcore fans of either Jurassic Park or 3D movies ... and even so , think about it .	-1
We wo n't be watching this movie any longer due to the bad words and a few other parts that were just not necessary for the movie to be a complete success . The foul language was not necessary . It is very intense and filled with action.Could have been excellent .	-1
OK , the devil posessed me at this very point when I 'm writing this . But I '' ve always felt this way anyhow ... . If no one in the world has said this before , may I be the first.Jurassic Park is one hell of a disaster . Those who made this should be eradicated from earth . The biggest turkey in cinema history ( and let us not forget the giant pelicans too ) , if you 're buying this because of its achievements in special effects and sounds then count yourself as someone who has no clue at all what cinema is about . A film that is simply a waste of time and talent.As for Spielberg voted as the No.1 director in AFI ( ? ) 's Best Director list , are you kidding ? ?	-1
This is my first one star review ever ( I believe ) and this rendition of Jurassic Park deserves a fat zero . I have very fond memories of the raptor jumping up to the ceiling to get the little girl near the end of this movie and how the audience in the theater squealed and jumped in their seats . There were other scenes in this movie perfect for 3D as well and I could n't wait to get this DVD . WHAT A MISTAKE ! This is the worst 3D movie I 've ever seen . It 's like they took the normal film and sliced it into 3 parts - front - middle - back and that 's it . Drove me crazy and was hurting my eyes near the end . If they were showing stuff from & # 34 ; the middle & # 34 ; the front was so blurry it hurt and likewise from other positions , but the clincher was the people ! When people were talking to each other in lots of scenes they were n't looking directly at each other at all . You could tell the film had been split and it put everyone out of alignment . Unbelievable ! ! ! I truly have not been this disappointed in any 3D movie before . Stick to the Blu-ray version . The 3D movie is a waste of money , time , and will send you to the eye doctor if you 're not careful . Take my advice and run from this one ! BTW : The jumping raptor was a joke too .	-1
The single star is for Universal and NOT this brilliant film . The 'To Kill a Mockingbird ' blu ray has been up for pre-order since January . That is deplorable . Universal continually does a bad job with their great classic catalogue . From the Hitchcocks to the Monster movies of the 30s and 40s will be neglected because Universal does n't believe in upgrading these treasures to blu ray . They do n't think old movies will make them money . Shame on them . Amazon , you should pull this from pre-order . It will never happen .	-1
Does not age well . The book is a classic but the film is poorly made . Besides Gregory Peck the acting is amateurish . I disliked the daughter in the movie but in the book she 's the narrator	-1
Give the filmmakers credit for a couple of things , at least . The story moves along well and is filmed very well . There are a few moments that actually have a bit of tension , the music score works quite well , and occasionally everything gels into a good scene.But let me get this straight . The FBI is on the hunt for an assassin so elusive only one woman in the world can ID him , she 's disappeared years ago and is equally elusive , yet an Irish gun-runner in a US prison is the key to both so the FBI gets him out and basically lets him run the operation ? All the cliches are here , too . The `` Here 's the key to a locker in a bus/train station where you 'll find ( whatever ) , '' the `` invincible villain purposely leaving an obscure clue that is unconvincingly figured out just in the nick of time to foil his evil plot , '' the `` master of disguise , '' the `` stupid greedy minor character who tries to rip off the villain only to die in a horrible way , '' etc . etc . etc.Poor Sidney Poitier . One of this nation 's great actors is wasted in a role that could basically be played equally well by any one with a SAG card . Poor Tess Harper . The underrated actress gets high billing here , but only shows up for the last half-hour , and she plays a thinly-veiled Hillary Clinton , complete with horrible hairdo and abdominable wardrobe . Worse , her two scenes ( only two ? ! ) consist of a brief interview with Larry King and a public speech that plays in the background.And Bruce Willis as the Jackal himself is as woefully miscast as the cold-blooded killer for hire . Trying to break out of type , Addison ? It ai n't workin ' . In every single scene I expected him to break into a smirking wisecrack a la `` Moonlighting '' or `` Die Hard , '' etc. , being only momentarily able to sustain the truly psycho attitude.Oddly , the one actor who fares best here is Richard Gere . I 'll buy his Irish accent , and he plays his character well here , although , again , it makes one roll with laughter to see him time and again take leadership in planning sessions both with the director and deputy director of the FBI . Said big shots basically sit by and say `` Yeah , that 's a good plan , let 's do it . '' And I do wish Gere would learn to open his mouth and speak up rather than mush his lines . He 's no Brando.So , to sum up : Stupid plot , badly miscast actors , and oh yes , one of the most left-field nonsensical endings you 'll ever see ...	-1
I missed & quot ; The Jackal & quot ; when it was released , but the promo 's all said it was a modern remake of the classic & quot ; Day of the Jackal & quot ; . Forget it ! Not only is this a bad remake , it 's so boring I trashed it halfway thru and never want to see it again . Put your time and money into the original & quot ; Day of the Jackal & quot ; and see what a great movie-maker like Fred Zinneman and company can do with a story like this .	-1
As for the first JP movie , it was fantastic , with its genuine , suspense , terror and the general scenery . As for JP2 , it 's a slippery , incoherent mess of a movie , which insults it even further by claiming to be a sequel by boasting Jeff Goldblum , Richard Attenborough ( in a brief cameo ) , the gorgeous Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn.This movie does n't seem to be given the typical Spielburg magic to most of his movies . Lots of blood , gore and general grossness are what 's this movie based , primarily . It seems more like a slasher movie , with the dinosaurs as the big baddies . The only thing that survives are a few intact scary scenes , a bit of suspense and Julianne Moore , with her bold performance as Ian 's latest girlfriend.See JP and JP3 . They are much , much better than this slapdash job what Spielburg did . It compares with A.I . as one of Spielburg 's worst movies ever directed . If you want to see a good Spielburg film , see E.T. , Schindler 's List , or either JP or JP3 ( though Spielburg only produced JP3 , he still qualifies as being involved in the movie 's production ) .What ever happened to the enjoying flicks you used to make about twenty years ago , Spielburg ? You KNOW you can do better .	-1
The second Jurassic Park movie , `` The Lost World '' , was a huge let down from the first movieJurassic Park ( Widescreen Collector 's Edition ) . While sequels seldom live up to the original movie , this one miss the mark by a wide margin . About the only thing to recommend about the movie are the outstanding CGI effects , everything else was poorly conceived and executed.This movie centers around Dr. Malcolm ( played heavy handed by Jeff Goldblum ) as he tries to rescue his girlfriend ( Julianne Moore ) from more of Hammond 's ( brief appearance by Richard Attenborough ) dinosaurs . There is also a brief appearance of Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello ( Hammond 's grandchildren from the first movie ) , but sadly they really play no part in this movie . What we get instead is Dr. Malcolm 's young daughter ( not a bad actress at all , but laughable casting ) as a plot device to provide more incentive for the main characters to be heroic.While most moves require some suspension of disbelief , this movie has plot holes so large that you could fit a herd of Brachiosaurus through them . All of the characters are caricatures that are so incredibly flat and poorly fleshed out that they act in ways no human would behave in a real life or death situation . The list includes Malcolm 's non-stop `` I told you so '' , the experienced field researchers ignoring basic interaction protocols , the daughter 's surprising development of Ninja like fighting skills , the evil hunter who only wants to destroy something beautiful , the greedy incompetent corporate executive , and , perhaps most annoying of all , the `` Earth First'er '' who would jeopardize human life to save an animal . It is bad enough that the movie is tedious , but sadly it is also preachy.Unfortunately this movie should be watched to get the full Jurassic Park experience , but do n't take it too seriously .	-1
One of my biggest complaints with this movie was the tagline `` Something has survived . '' So ? Why would n't something have survived ? As I recall at the end of Jurassic Park everyone just evacuates the island and leaves the dinosaurs to themselves so of course something has survived . Now if you read the book where they bomb the island back to the stone age ( no pun intended ) it would make sense that everything should have been dead . Then they go on to tell us that it was based on Michael Crichton 's book . Could someone please tell me which parts ? ( spoilers ) First of all the opening scene where the girl gets attacked by the compys is actually the beginning to the FIRST book . What was up with that ? Then when we get into the plot the ONLY character that even remotely resembled his character from the book was Ian Malcolm . The rest of the characters were either one character 's name transplanted onto another 's personality or completely made up for the movie such as the ENTIRE expedition that was attempting to capture live dinosaurs . Then at the end that whole T-Rex rampage through town , what moron thought that would be a good idea ? Another element that never happend in the book . O.K . I understand that movies are basically never exactly like the book , but should n't there have been at least ONE scene from the book included in the movie ? The only one I can remember is the T-Rexs kicking the trailers off the cliff and the kicking of the trailers was the only thing about that scene that was correct nothing else . One last question : What was the high hide hanging from ?	-1
This movie is really , really bad.The acting is horrific , the action scenes are boring and unscary but most importantly ; there is no plot ! I do not understand this movie at all . To me and to a lot of people , it just is a big mess in order to make money.In my opinion , they should never have made a sequel . The original is amazing while this one is horrible.In conclusion , The Lost World : Jurassic Park is a very bad movie and is not worth your time of day.I do not recommend this movie .	-1
I wish that `` Mature Had Found A Way '' to make Steven Spielberg understand that a movie needs more than special effects . The plot is trite . The characters are wooden . The product placements are numerous and obvious . The special effects are nothing special and after the fist couple of minutes very boring . What more can be said/ This is a review that was thrown together by what seems like a group of people who did not care . It is just a very very bad movie . I 'm very sorry that I bought the DVD of this very bad movie.Is there a list of very bad movies ? This one should be on it .	-1
Jeff Goldblum returns and has to deal with more dino mendees when it turns out there is a secondary island containing the creatures.Too bad he has to deal with some greedy hunters too.Disappointing and slow at first this sequel loses all the entertainment value the original had with a cliched script filled with bad plans only to end with a ridiculous Godzilla-like rampage finale.Groanable gymnastics scene to .	-1
Terrible script , ludicrous firefighting scenes , a mailed-in performance from DeNiro - and most of all , Billy Baldwin with a painful-to-watch attempt at acting that would get him kicked out of the high-school drama club .	-1
BACKDRAFT ( USA - 1991 ) Aspect ratio : 2.39:1 ( Super 35 ) Theatrical soundtracks : 6-track Dolby Stereo / Q SoundTwo firefighting brothers ( Kurt Russell and William Baldwin ) are forced to confront the ghosts of their past whilst pursuing an arsonist who targets prominent members of Chicago 's political elite.Former TV actor Ron Howard ( `` Happy Days '' ) directed this high-profile Hollywood blockbuster , in which a cast of solid B-list actors and A-list supporting players ( Robert DeNiro , Donald Sutherland , et al ) are upstaged by scenes of fiery devastation , wrought with frightening intensity by incredible stuntwork and state-of-the-art visual effects . Plot-wise , the film is an old-fashioned barnstormer , directed with gee-whizz efficiency by Howard , whose attempts to wring high emotion from Greg Widen 's corny script rings entirely false from the outset . Hans Zimmer 's generic music score is overbearing in places , particularly during the 'tragic ' finale .	-1
Silly stuff . Godzilla movies are more realistic . If real-time chemistry/biology and physics had been applied , most of the characters would have died within the first 30 seconds of the film from having seared lungs and/or smoke inhalation . And how does William Baldwin end up in a film with experienced actors ? And why would experienced actors allows this ? And what was Ron Howard and the producers `` smoking '' ? It 's a real shame how inept and slapped together the script is considering the special effects are pretty damned decent . They 're more appropriate for a Terminator movie than this nonsense .	-1
YES ! I agree with the other reviewers ! This is the one VanDamm movie I LOVE and when I found it in my one used shop I was so extatic I never looked to see screen format ! I never though that it would be Full Screen @ ! # ! * ! % ! ! ! ! ! Ye Gods ! it totally ruins that wonderful sceen in the kitchen of him doing the splits ! Hey ya I 'm a red-blooded female ... and I can go OUCH at that scene too ! that stunt hurts to do and man ... ..Whistle ... ..Looks very nice ! The cropping really really ruins the impressive impact of that scene and I 've not see the picture since it first came outit was really a Disappointment when I saw FULL SCREENCome on UNIVERSAL ! ! ! WE WANT WIDE SCREEN ! FULL PICTURE ! ! ! ! this is a fantastic action picture and a crying shame to see it in full screen only ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Clich & eacute ; , cheesy , but the saving grace is the early 90 's haircuts , too-roomy button-ups , and Where 's Waldo glasses on everybody . A 1990s style anthropologist 's dream . Makes Red October look like the best film ever shot .	-1
Unless you like the blues as covered by manic amateurs in an unending Saturday Night Live sketch , avoid this Two-Stoogified , let's-put-on-a-show time-waster.At any moment , I expected a samurai shouting `` cheesebaga , cheesebaga '' to run onstage while brandishing a plastic sword.A seat-squirmer of a movie.Would n't watch it again for money.Fans , remember : De gustibus non est disputandum	-1
Half-Baked , a film about a couple of buddies who sit around all day and do drugs , is not only not worth while to watch , but it 's filled with bad acting and a poor script with characters that do n't seem to fit . When I watched it , I could n't believe all the stupidty it produced . In every movie , I can find good for almost every scene , a way of understanding it and realizing what the director was trying to show his audience , but in this film , it was difficult to do that . I was very displeased in this , for it not only wasted my time , it made me think twice about renting another movie like this again . I would recommend American pie if your looking for a comedy . But for a film that does nothing but show drug usage , and shows no point in doing so , I 'd recommend a more worth your while film , like Traffic or Scarface ( Al Pacino ) .	-1
For anyone who has any respect for the Christ figure , as a Christian or not , this production should leave your perplexed at best and horribly disappointed at worst . The film , particularly the story 's lyrics , is clearly the production of someones who have absolutely no insight into the story of Christ . There is nothing that this film contributes beyond some good music . Christ as he is portrayed here is hopelessly off the mark . How ANYONE could give this film more than one star totally amazes me . The question that plagues me is : why ? Why was this musical made ? I have great respect for Weber and most of his work is truly admirable , but what was he thinking , what was the point of this . I have not seen the stage production , but I am sure that I would dismiss it as well as this film . And why does Jewison perpetuate the unfounded myth that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute ? Who did the research for this work ? This work is such a mishmash of banalities . A total embarrassment . I could n't wait for it to be over.Christ was doubtless a magnificent personage , a man of supreme wisdom and inspiration - and yet , NONE of that comes through in this production . This could have been a thousand times better . The representation of Christ succeeded only in approximating what we have feebly imagined Christ to look like . Of course , in reality , Christ was a brown-eyed Middle Eastern Jew , not a blue-eyed blonde ! And what message are we to take from Judas being portrayed by a black man . YOU 'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ! If not for the music and the show 's reputation , I am sure I would have turned off this movie within 15 minutes .	-1
The Bottom Line : A dated and irrelevant rock opera version of the end of Jesus 's life , Jesus Christ Superstar features a couple of catchy tunes but mainly just feels long and loud .	-1
Ted Neeley should be crucified , literally , for being the worst Jesus in any film . Was Jimmy Stewart unavailable to play a worse version of Jesus ? I think Ted Neeley is also the first person to play Jesus with a lazy eye . This is just the beginning of my problems with this movie.I could have sworn Yoko Ono was playing Mary Magdaline . The actress had the same vocal abilities as Yoko . In my opinion , Elton John did the best job playing King Herod . Rick James would have made a great Judas.I realize my review is just addressing the acting , what about the plot you ask ? There was not one . The keep singing bad songs until they are mercifully stopped when Jesus is crucufied . The best part was making the Last Supper into a picnic . Who brought the Spam ? As a Christian , I have never hated a Bible story . But what they have done to the story of Jesus life certainly has turned the greatest story into a sham . I would rather go blind than watch this again .	-1
Sure , Arnold is kind of funny and the kids are very cute , but the constant violence , language , junkies , and aiming guns at small children was a real turnoff in the age of Columbine and other school shootings . I definitely do not recommend this for any children .	-1
Those of you at Universal Home Video , please please please release this great film in its original WIDESCREEN format , along with Twins ! Both films deserve better than 10-year-old pan & scan transfers !	-1
The Nutty Professor is complete trash ! Eddie Murphy is not that funny , do n't understand why people thinks he 's brilliant . Jada Pinkett Smith is even worse , terrible actress and she is just famous because of her husband . I could n't find anything fresh about this remake , do n't watch this pathetic film .	-1
The origianal Babe movie was wonderfull . It was like a live action disney movie where annimals talk . Now we have the sequel and we have to ask ourselfs , what the heck went wrong here ? Babe 2 is one of the worst sequels to a movie I have ever seen . Its incrediably dark , disturbing and very unpleasent.The film starts off right where the first one ended , with farmer Hogget returning to the farm to live happily ever after , but sience this is a sequel , we can not let that happen . So Babe accidentaly pushes Farmer Hogget into a well and nearly kills him . While he is recovering , the happy cheerfull bank people show up and tell the Hoggets that they are about to loose the farm . So Ms. Hogget decides to head into the city with Babe and make some money . When they arrive they eventually reach a hotel in what has to be the most bogus city set I 've ever seen.After that the typical bad stuff happens and its a lot worse then before . The annimal cast consists of really mean dogs , annoying bossy Godfather like apes and a whole lot more . The only nice annimals are Good natured Babe , some cute Kittens , and Ferdinand the Duck . All the other annimals are making Babes life really miserable.While at first Babe 2 seems charming , that instantly jumps out the window when you first see the annimal cruelty scenes . Babe is constantly attacked , a dog is strangled by his chain underwater and nearly drowns , another dog attacks a car and is dead for a few minutes ( but he recovers ) kittens go hungry , and in a horrifyingly disturbing sequence , the hotel is assulted by annimal catchers . All this cruelty to annimals , and you wish they would die just to put them out of thier misery.I was shocked at how un-kid friendly this is . I recommned that you do n't take your kids to see it , it will diminish the fond memories of the first one.The Good : Its a Babe movie , The narrator does a great job , some nice annimalsThe bad : really really dark ( and not in lighting sense ) , awful sets.and the ugly : Lots of annimal cruelty scenes , the apes and dogs are very annoying , definatly not for young kids .	-1
This really is n't much of a movie . It is n't particularly enjoyable at all - perhaps most damaging is the acting from pretty much everyone involved . They come off as fast food employees rather than mythic characters - would you like fries with that slashing ? Thoroughly disappointing.The plot itself is n't too shabby , but the dialogue is abysmal , and the whole thing just is n't put together very well.On the whole it has the look of an episode of a television show rather than a feature.The 96 minutes pass by quickly enough , but ... there are better ways to employ that time .	-1
Simply put , this movie sucked . It tried to take the effects of Hercules and put it into a movie . Sorry , it did n't work . This movie had terrible acting ( if you want to call it acting ) , a predictable plot that a bunch of drunks probably got together to make , and just lacked in everything from dialouge to action . My recommendation is not to watch , listen about , talk about , or even think about this movie or you 'll just get dumber .	-1
I 'm still not totally sure of what I was expecting from Conan , but I was quite disappointed in the end . I 'm shocked that Arnie went on to become governor of California , cos with the standard of the film , I really would n't have expected Arnie to go onto bigger & better things.My main problem with Conan , was it was n't Arnie 's best film , plus , it 's just really a film to showcase his body is n't it ? And he barely says more than a few lines during the entire film . I 've been brought up on Arnie movies , and although this was a good film , I just prefer some of Arnie 's later films . I just wish he would stop messing with being governor and get back to what he 's good at ! You can see throughout the film that Arnie has immense trouble holding a sword , and doing sword things with it , due the size of his arm & chest muscles.The rest of the cast was quite good , although I did think the actress who played his mum at the beginning , was a rough-looking Bridgette Bardot ! Hehe . I did think Sandahl Bergman , who played Valeria , was really pretty , and the relationship between her and Conan was outstanding , although he only speaks five words to her throughout the film ! Their relationship does turn out to be quite bittersweet though , which is very sad , but I wo n't reveal too much about it , for those who have n't seen the film yet.There 's not much of a storyline to the entire movie , apart from getting revenge , and the beginning is a bit strange in my opinion . Pushing that wheel thing round and round , what happened to the rest of the children ? James Earl Jones is absolutely hilarious , but I do n't think he was meant to be . He 's very androgynous , and the wig is stupidly set too high , giving the impression he has a huge forehead.Conan has a certain unique-ness to it , and it stands out from many other similar films out there . It 's quite memorable as well , whereas I think if Arnie had n't become a big star , then it might have been less so . Yes , I 'll admit I do n't particularly Conan , but I sat through it , and can still remember a lot of it . And it still survives against the special effects laden movies of today , with people with too much money , try to make up for the lack of storyline with too many special effects ( hello Pirates Of The Caribbean Dead Man 's Chest , I 'm talking to you ! ) . Conan manages with minimalist special effects and it works so much better.I would recommend Conan to any Arnie fans out there , it 's an excellent film , it just did n't do it for me . Now , where 's Twins ? ! : )	-1
For the record , I 'm a HUGE fan of the original Robert E. Howard character , and a really big fan of the forst movie ( not so much the second one though ) .If you 're going to get this on DVD , go out of your way to find the original 1982 version , NOT the collector 's version . The collector 's version basically extends a couple of scenes that ( quite frankly ) were better left the way they were , and do NOTHING to enhance the story or character in any way . In this case , brevity can be the essence of genius , not additional exposition.Another gripe is , this version is released on mono NOT stereo . FREAKIN ' MONO ! ? What the hell happened ? Even 'Freddy Got Fingered ' is in 5.1 these days . This movie truly had one of the mose dramatic original soundtracks of it 's time , and on this version of the DVD it 's barely just an afterthought . Very disrespectful to the filmmakers , and the fans.Seroiusly , I know there 's an original cut on DVD somewhere . If you can find it , it 's worth going out of your way for .	-1
`` People have no grasp of what they do ! '' One of the few great lines delivered by James Earl Jones in this film.I really can not add anything to the previous reviews that have been written , each explains a little bit about the film to give the reader of the reviews a good grasp of this edition of the DVD . So in that sense this will be a different review - not of the movie itself ( which was a good barbarian genre film , especially for one filmed in 1982 but not so much a good representation of Robert E. Howard 's character Conan ) , but this review is about the special feature on the making of Conan.That special feature alone is worth the price of the DVD . Great detail is given by everyone who was largely involved in the making of this film . It is a good history behind the film and how it developed . Everything is covered from the actors and how they were chosen , all the way to the music and why it was written the way it was to match the tone , mood , and texture of the film.However , there is one portion of this special feature that needs to be corrected . The director , John Milius , when describing Robert E. Howard , declares that Howard was 'insane , ' that Howard believed that the town 's people [ in Cross Plains ] were after him so he boarded up the windows of his home , and loaded up his rifles in order to protect himself . This is simply not true . In fact John Milius in this description is speaking in serious hyperbole and exaggeration . REH was eccentric , he was 'mad ' in a certain type of way , but he never acted the way Milius had described him as acting.I have been a REH fan since 1981 , having grown up in Abilene , which is only about 40 miles north west of Cross Plains , where Howard lived , wrote , and died . I have read just about everything he ever wrote . I have also researched histories that were written by him or about him including Glenn Lord 's collection titled `` The Last Celt : A Bio-Bibliography of Robert E. Howard , and `` One Who Walked Alone : Robert E. Howard - The Final Years '' written by Novalyn Price Ellis , who actually dated REH the last two or three years of his life.I was actually flabbergasted when I heard John Milius make these remarks and wanted to make sure , in a review here at Amazon , that these statements were corrected . Otherwise , the special feature on the making of the movie was great and very informative.If you are a Howard fan I highly recommend you make a visit to Cross Plains , Texas and see the REH Home and Museum . It is well worth the trip . I wish more Conan movies could have been made , but perhaps in the future someone else will pick up that project . In the mean time , I recommend the newly republished versions of Howard 's works which have been periodically released by Dell Rey Publishing ( The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian , The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane , The Bloody Crown of Conan , Bran Mak Morn : The Last King , The Conquering Sword of Conan , etc . ) , you can get those here at Amazon .	-1
This movie was a disappointed . I think it was overrated . I expected a lot more . If you want to see great films in the same genre , try Goodfellas , Donnie Brasco , The Godfather	-1
In almost every Joe Pesci movie - he either gets beat up or killed . Not only did he get beat up in this movie , he got killed too ... something that was long overdue ! It seems as though every movie Martin Scorsese has to make - it has to have Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in it.This movie - has to be one of the worst films of all crime movies ( other movies that share my award are : The Last Don I-II ) . Scorsese who has finished another movie GANGS OF NEW YORK , but to tell you the truth , it 'll probably be the same movie only in a different time period.At least Francis Ford Coppola knows that he can not top the Godfather series . But unlike Coppola - he keeps on going on the one topic that once gained him much success.So at least Joe Pesci has n't been any films recently ( I think that movie audiences are tired of his voice ) , and Scorsese is n't the biggest successful director.The only two actors that are doing well from the movie are : Robert De Niro , Sharon Stone and James Woods.And another part of the movie that is annoying is the trading of narrating ! It 's Pesci and then it 's De Niro - he basically sounds like he 's doing the commentary for a movie on the DVD , but only sounds more excited and interested .	-1

I know the movie and know I would have loved to watch it today . BUT this is a special type of DVD that was the loser in the Blue Ray vs HD war around 2006 . I know all this because I researched it after the mood hit me to watch this disc on a rainy day . We have 2 players and several computers none will play . Glad I spent less than 4 dollars . They should have a note about this .	-1
It wont play at all - get error msg that it cant be read - the 2 minor scratches on the outside edgemust be just enough that its not readable	-1
I do n't know why the Amazon review above says that this is the original aspect ratio ( widescreen ) . The original movie was NOT shot in widescreen . I have the old VHS tape and the new DVD to prove it . Compare both the VHS tape and the DVD and you will see that they cut off the bottom and the top for the DVD to make it look like it was shot in widescreen . Hitchcock would be horrified ! After all the trouble he went through storyboarding every camera shot ... ..	-1
THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE LEGACY EDITION DVD -- THE BLU RAY IS AMAZING ( 5-stars ) AND WORTH DOUBLE DIPPING ( or in my case triple dipping ) .I am not a techno wiz so I have no idea what it takes to remaster an older movie , but this was NO different than the collector 's edition that came out several years ago . I was very disappointed as there is still a ton of specs during the movie and it 's very grainy . In fact I am not sure this is n't WORSE than the one before . If they can take a movie from 1940 ( It 's a Wonderful Life ) and make it almost flawless , why could n't they do it to Psycho , which was made 20 years later . Very disappointing . The special features are all fine but half of them were on the other disc too . But regardless , you buy a dvd for the film and this is a major let down . I want my $ 20 back .	-1
The laser disc version of & quot ; The Sting & quot ; was in the & quot ; full-screen & quot ; format , and this new DVD simply copies the laser disc . But the movie was meant to be seen in widescreen . You only see part of the action in this fullscreen version , and often the parts clipped out at the sides are essential to enjoying the film . It is a total disgrace that Hollywood released this cut version . I hope the widescreen version comes out if enough people make their protests heard .	-1
I 'll chip in with another 1 star review of a 5 star movie . There is no excuse for releasing a classic movie such as this on a horrible pan and scan full screen DVD . Do n't buy this until Universal releases the whole movie on DVD .	-1
& quot ; Is this heaven ? & quot ; & quot ; No , it 's Iowa. & quot ; No , it 's purgatory , movie-going purgatory . Push the obligatory Norman Rockwellesque buttons , slather on the schmaltz with a trowel , throw in the cute-as-a-button little kid , stir well ... Kevin Costner is wooden , Amy Madigan is brain-dead , Timothy Busfield is at his annoying worst ( or is it best ? ) . For a decent baseball flick , how about & quot ; Bull Durham & quot ; or & quot ; The Natural & quot ; ? As the movie sez & quot ; Ease his pain & quot ; . Yeah . Let the viewer go .	-1
Viewed : 10/07Rate : 310/07 : All right , I had to watch Conan the Destroyer since it is a sequel to Conan the Barbarian . Just what I expected : a boring fanfare . It 's incredibly hard for me to take a film seriously when Wilt Chamberlain is in it . Anyway , I thought Conan the Destroyer was slightly better than the original because it was shorter , somewhat less boring , and more passable . The acting was not bad , but it was n't great . The subplots were wafer-thin because when one was initiated , it got dropped later . A good example is the `` ending '' . It was n't an ending at all ; just a continuum . Thank goodness , there was no third part . Had Malak ( played by Tracey Walter ) be cut out of the film entirely , Conan the Destroyer would have had a better rating . He was so despicably annoying and hated . Also , cut Grace Jones please . Cut Wilt Chamberlain . Cut Olivia d'Abo . Man , what a lousy cast . A couple of redeeming qualities about Conan the Destroyer is the custom and set designs . I thought they were very good and deserving of merits . Poor dialogue wrecked havoc on the film as whole . I am disappointed that Conan had to wallop the poor camel for nothing . Did that queen look very , very familiar ? Masters of Universe , right ? I wonder what had happened to the Conan franchise as it expected a third part . Well , the Terminator came , and the rest was history . Sire Conan , please let me borrow the steel . *swinging* *chops off Malak 's head* Thank you , sire Conan . Now , Conan the Destroyer is officially history .	-1
So Conan and friends - including Wilt Chamberlain as Bombaata and Grace Jones as Zula - are on a mission to protect a virgin princess who gets a powerful horn for the queen . Let me get this straight , someone thought it was a good idea to make a sequel to Conan the Barbarian , AND they thought it would be a good idea to cast Wilt Chamberlain to play a warrior who protects a maiden 's virginity ? Maybe the casting director 's next choice can be OJ as a babysitter , or Steve Martin as funny.Look , I loved the original . It was epic . Everything from the story and action to even the score was great . But this sequel is abysmal , and it ruined what could have been ( was supposed to be ? ) a trilogy of Conan movies . When Arnold is the guy in the film with the most polished acting chops , there is something extremely wrong.I would have walked out on this movie if I were watching it on an airplane .	-1
After director John Milius crafted a classic with the big screen adaptation of Conan the Barbarian , Universal pumped out this sequel two years later aimed at a younger crowd . Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as Conan , and is undoubtadly the best thing about this film which almost parodies the original . Also featured is one of the campiest casts ever assembled which includes Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain . All in all , Conan the Destroyer is n't a bad film on it 's own when you do n't compare it to the original or take it seriously .	-1
We had to cut it off , the vulgarity and immature situations may appeal to some early teens without a moral compass but this was nothing more than a blatant attempt to be funny and constantly curse the Lord and others . Ron Howard has really sunk into the pit .	-1
All sidekicks and sight gags , with little story cohesion or purpose . The concept is inane , and the execution is manic and unoriginal . Fancifully bloody yet flavorless , it provides perfunctory amusement for very young viewers .	-1
wow , what a disappointment.i had high hopes for this movie.i had heard it was great.and it was directed by Brian De Palma with a screenplay by Oliver Stone.not to mention it 's rated # 161 of the top 250 on IMDb so far , so good , right ? wrong.for me , this is a decent movie but nothing more.it never really engaged me.i was n't bored necessarily , but i was n't overly interested either.the acting did very little for me , except for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio , who i thought was exceptional as Gina Montana.there were some good actors here , but i feel they were wasted . Al Pacino was n't really impressive.also , this was supposed to be controversial movie , but i have seen a lot worse in terms of both violence and language.anyway , i would certainly not place this movie in my top 250 movies of all time.it does n't have the impact of the original 1932 version.for me , Scarface is a 2.5/5	-1
By now I 'm sure you know the story , so I wo n't rehash what we already know : This is a GREAT film ... And a film as epic as SCARFACE deserves an equally awesome treatment on DVD , right ? ? ? ... . Well , the folks who put this trasnsfer out should be ashamed : it 's the worst looking DVD I 've seen ... , and it really distracts from the overall impact of the film ... Grainy , pixelated and washed out , SCARFACE is n't allowed to shine the way it should ... Rent before you buy , and for hardcore fans , hope that eventually the true definitive version will be released ...	-1
I saw Brian DePalma 's & quot ; Scarface & quot ; in a theater when I was a big fan of violent action movies . & quot ; Scarface & quot ; is one of DePalma 's very worst movies.Cuban refugee Tony Montana ( Al Pacino ) becomes a drug dealer in Florida . Montana rises to power as a cocaine kingpin but his success is only short-lived. & quot ; Scarface & quot ; is Brian DePalma 's second worst film after & quot ; Raising Cain. & quot ; The viewers do n't develop any real concern for Al Pacino 's character . In such masterpieces as & quot ; Carrie & quot ; and & quot ; Dressed To Kill , & quot ; DePalma brilliantly combined lurid sexual motifs with the graphic violence taking place in the films . In & quot ; Scarface , & quot ; DePalma attempts to interweave themes regarding incest into the violent storyline but these efforts are hollow and heavy-handed . DePalma 's film is raunchy and crude to the point of being farcical . The movie probably has more swearing than any film in the history of cinema . As a crime film , & quot ; Scarface & quot ; has none of the decency and intelligence that is evident in the work of Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese . One of the movie 's few redeeming features is an AWESOME one-man-versus-an-entire-army action sequence towards the end of the film. & quot ; Scarface & quot ; is nothing more than a foul-mouthed , trashy , and forgettable film . The movie is only for diehard Al Pacino fans , people who merely want to see violent action , and those who feel that they need to see every Brian DePalma film . For DePalma 's best crime film , see & quot ; The Untouchables. & quot ;	-1
What a terrible movie . Academy award ? What ? ! this was so boring i could n't finish it and i sold it right away .	-1
The Deer Hunter ( Universal Legacy Series ) is just as good as the HD DVD version . After watching both back and forth at the same time I could not see any difference on my Sony KDS 50A2020 in 1080p . My review is for the HD Quality and not the 5 Star Movie .	-1
Michael Cimino 's `` The Deer Hunter '' is a heartbreaking examination of the physical and emotional scars left on those who fought in Vietnam . Yet , while it does feature a number of strong performances , it is a work that is ultimately unfulfilling because of its disjointed and uneven narrative.Three friends from Clairton , Pennsylvania leave their hometown to fight in Vietnam . The strong bond between Michael Vronsky ( Robert De Niro ) , Steven ( John Savage ) , and Nikonar `` Nick '' Chevotarevich ( Christopher Walken ) helps them survive the horrific ordeal of being prisoners of the Vietcong . However , Nick is profoundly changed by his experiences and retreats to the shadowy world of life-and-death gambling . Michael searches for him intent on returning him to the life and community he had left behind . `` The Deer Hunter '' deserves praise for its mature examination of a difficult and painful subject . It refuses to tone down its gut-wrenching approach to the material and never strives for the traditional Hollywood happy ending . The performances are nothing short of superb . De Niro , Savage , Walken , along with John Cazale , and Meryl Streep are stunning . Yet , `` The Deer Hunter '' has two serious problems . First of all , it is not edited tightly . Energetic sequences are bracketed by sequences that are dull and run on for far too long . The story never develops any momentum as a result . Second , the three acts of `` The Deer Hunter '' do not blend together seamlessly . There is a start-and-stop feel when one act moves into the next because of a lack of transitions . This gives the narrative a rough and abrupt feel . In sum , these shortcomings harm `` The Deer Hunter '' enough to declare it a noble , but flawed , effort .	-1
This one took two hours to get going . The whole first three-quarters of the movie was a constant theme : `` Look how much we pal around and love each other ! '' The best part was over in thirty seconds . Avoid this bomb .	-1
I have now gone through TWO of these blu rays . Both show the `` internet '' previews , and then `` hang '' . Ca n't get to the disc menu , ca n't start the movie . I do n't need a firmware upgrade on my blu ray player . Is anyone else having these issues ?	-1
I have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics , or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I can not compare the character to other sources . Therefore , coming from someone that did not `` know '' Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment ! There are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies , like the Shadow , Batman etc , which is interesting.Nevertheless , Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast : Liam Neeson , Larry Drake , and Frances McDormand among others . It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement . In an effort to exact revenge , he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims ... .In short , the acting and the plot are average ( nothing great ) , while the dialogues are way below average . The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.The characters are , overall , bland and just plain uninteresting ( e.g . Rick Anderson played by the `` fool , '' Ted Raimi , from the Xena series ) .Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off . A shame really ... In a nutshell , it 's not a movie you would want to add to your collection , but it might provide for an evening 's entertainment , and that 's about it.No masterpiece here ... 2 Stars	-1
Liam Neeson and Frances McDormand are miscast in this clunky mess of a movie , with an awful , soap operatic script -- `` I 've got ta have time to work this out , '' `` If you 're not going to kill me , I have things to do . '' There really is n't any chemistry between them , with Neeson pleading `` Julie , Julie '' early on , in an attempt to get her to marry him . The script is too clunky to make any kind of romance between them believable , and thugs going to extremes of sadism and cruelty to disfigure and mutilate Neeson for a piece of paper that might implicate someone in a housing scandal ? Way beyond believable overkill . How Neeson , who is a fine actor , not to mention McDormand , got involved in this mess is a mystery . They are utterly miscast , and there is n't any real chemistry between them . The continuity of the special effects will not win any great awards , and the thing bangs back and forth from melodramatic pillar to post , with drawn out , preposterously bad speeches at the end , as they face off high above the ground balancing on steel girders . It 's like a really , really bad version of `` Phantom of the Opera , '' with a disfigured Neeson running around in ace bandages and capes ducking and dodging explosions , in all manner of facial guises , none of them very pleasant . It all comes across as pointless and silly .	-1
I walked out of the theatre after about a half hour of this violent mess . I literally could not stomach such grossness . How anyone can stomach viewing the savage attack featured in this film is beyond me.You want a good movie , that 's also a one-word title ending with `` man '' ? Go see the first `` Superman '' -- now that 's a good movie .	-1
The movie is awesome - 5 stars.HD DVD transfer looks grainy ( digital noise ) and the colors are off and washed out . As crazy as it sounds , it looks worse then I remember it on VHS.Anyway , the standard DVD is better than this on an upconvert DVD player.Really dissapointing ... .	-1
almost a sick movie portraying animals in skin of humans who thrive from violence slavery and other sicknesses of human mind . thanks to fast forward I did n't have to put up with the depression blood and guts of this cruel movie	-1
A great movie . However , a very terrible transfer to blu ray . Now I know why it was on sale for $ 7.5o a best-buys . Read the amazon reviews of any blu ray movie you might want to buy , and you will find out if the blu ray transfer is any good , or not.There needs to be some sort of govt . agency to check these movies out before these movie companies put more crap on the market . It seems these movie companies are out just for a buck , and there is know way for us to get our cash back when they try to pass junk off on us .	-1
Set in 1962 , this coming of age story for California guys showcases the pop world from a male perspective . In a dusk-to-dawn marathon , the guys face their respective rites of passage -- when boys supposedly turn into `` men . '' This film got one thing right about the 60 's : the `` goils '' simply exist as foils or fluffy fantasy fodder for the male gaze.The film is a classic example of author Inez Hedge 's central thesis in her book `` Breaking the Frame '' where she explores film language and the experience of cinematic limits . In general , film viewers are rarely shown what occurs inside the minds of the female characters . Women exist as subjects within a frame that assumes the male perspective . Women 's passive positioning in film language is reinforced by two directorial tactics : 1 ) most point-of-view shots are taken from a male perspective ; 2 ) males originate most of the action.As another man for feminism , I 'm perplexed as to why so many readers fail to find value in this honest assessment . I 'm not knocking George Lucas in general ; he was brilliant in THX 1138 , but in this follow up flick , he caved in to Hollywood .	-1
What is it with Universal Home Video and 1973 movies ? First they botch the video transfer on JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR with sloppy audio -- music tracks too subdued and muddy -- and now they 've done it again with AMERICAN GRAFFITI . Only this time the problem is just the opposite : The music overwhelms the dialogue ; it 's much too loud and echoing , and it sounds all wrong -- and in a movie where the oldies soundtrack is so important , the balance is destroyed . Like JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR , I saw AMERICAN GRAFFITI in the theater , and I know perfectly well it is Not . Supposed . To . Sound . Like . This . It 's not supposed to look like this , either . As other reviewers here have noted , the picture is much too dark and murky , with too many video artifacts . Do you remember how AMERICAN GRAFFITI sparkled in 1973 ? You 'd better , because it does n't anymore . In many important scenes you simply ca n't see what 's going on . I only knew because I remembered.The video transfer on JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR is tolerable -- just -- but AMERICAN GRAFFITI has been absolutely wrecked -- both DVD and Blu-ray . It 's one of the great movies , too ; if you 've never seen it , too bad , because you never will if you start here.I 'm watching it as I type this , and it 's just getting worse and worse ; I wish I could give it zero stars . I 'd better go ahead and post this now ; if I wait any longer I ca n't be responsible for what I might say . It 's just awful.Shame on you , Universal ; you 're trashing your heritage . That 's your privilege , I suppose , if you want to be so careless and stupid and incompetent . But you 're trashing my memories too , and you 've got no right to do that .	-1
I like National Lampoon 's movies in general . This one how ever I hated . I found it to be terribly offensive . Volger beyond belief . Needless to say I did n't finish watching this movie.i think that this movie is a waste of money . It really is not worth purchasing .	-1
Well , the movie 's got the noir look . Too bad the plot is straight out of & quot ; Murder She Wrote & quot ; . What elevates this movie to two stars is the prescence of Peter Lorre as the shady nightclub owner . It just reminds you that Hollywood wasted this actor of considerable skill in shoddy vehicles like this .	-1
My only reason for seeing this film is because Luis Guzman is in it . I prefer the murder mysteries of Brian De Palma , but this movie is just a somewhat organized crime drama . Not a good film . Enjoyed seeing Penelope Ann Miller act again . DVD includes production notes , cast and filmmakers and theatrical trailer . Shown in squeezy widescreen.Followed by the straight-to-DVD film , CARLITO 'S WAY : RISE TO POWER ( 2005 ) , a prequel .	-1
I remember going to the theater to see `` Cape Fear '' when it was released 20 years ago , and walking out thinking that it just was n't very good . I decided to re-visit the film just to see if I would like it better now that I 'm older and have a family of my own , and the short answer is No . If anything `` Cape Fear '' is aging horribly , and outside of the two lead performances , and the re-hash of Bernard Hermann 's theme , there really is n't much to recommend about this film.If you are n't familiar with the story , then quit reading this and watch the originalCape Fear , as it 's a taut , suspenseful thriller , with unforgettable performances by the whole cast , and stay away from this dated , bloated remake . The basic story is that Max Cady ( Robert Di Niro ) is being released from prison after a 14 year sentence for assault . While in prison Cady discovered that his lawyer , Sam Bowden ( Nick Nolte ) , suppressed information that may have gotten him acquitted . Cady tracks down Bowden and begins to terrorize the lawyer and his family . Bowden knows that Cady is dangerous , but also very cunning . Cady bends the law , but does not break it , which means there is very little Bowden can do to stop Cady 's harrassment , short of breaking the law himself.While the basic storyline of a ex-con making a lawyer 's life hell remains the same as the original , so many story elements which made the original such a fascinating film are altered or thrown out altogether . Martin Scorsese seemed to want to tap into the Alfred Hitchcock mode for this one , so we get a ton of odd camera angles and a variety of overhead shots . It 's almost like he 's sacrificing substance for flash at times . The cast is horrible beyond the two leads who both put in great performances . Di Niro and Nolte are the only reason to watch this movie . Jessica Lange does n't really do much here , she gets to yell a few times , but overall she 's wasted in the film . I 'm not sure how or why in the early 1990 's Juliette Lewis was put into films and made a `` star '' ? ? She plays Juliette Lewis with an accent , and umm ... ..well she was Juliette Lewis . I did like seeing Peck and Mitchum make cameos here , but their being in the film was more of a novelty than adding anything.There is nothing in the remake that is n't done better in the original . So save your time and money , find the classic and do your best to forget this one every happened .	-1
Sam Cady ( Robert de Niro ) has just been released from prison , and wants revenge on Sam Bowdon ( Nick Nolte ) , the prosecutor who withheld evidence and sent him up . Cady begings stalking Sam 's wife and daughter , so the family decides to hide in their houseboat in Cape Fear.I found this film way too violent for my taste . Robert de Niro is so convincing as the sadistic con that I could hardly watch him . Nick Nolte is fine as the lawyer , but I thought Jessica Lange as his wife and Juliette Lewis as the daughter were unappealing and miscast . I prefer the original version of `` Cape Fear '' with Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck .	-1
This film goes in my top 5 most disliked films . The acting and music are awful all the way through . This is the film I use to measure the badness of others ! Spare yourself !	-1
WE HAVE TO ADMIT IT BOTH DID MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ; HOWEVER IT MAKES YOU THINK TWICE BEFORE GOING ON A BOAT AGAIN ; JESSICA LANGE IS PERFECT ; & amp ; IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR JULIETTE LEWIS ; OK BUT NOT GREAT ...	-1
Having seen and enjoyed the original Cape Fear , which is quite a thriller , I thought I 'd enjoy this . Wrong ! This is not a thriller . It 's an exercise in nastiness , cruelty , viciousness , hysteria and wild overacting . Scorcese takes a hideous villain and tries to make him somehow admirable -- but he 's not . He 's scuzzy , and remains so . And the family that 's being tormented is portrayed as a bunch of awful people as well.After being disgusted by this movie and its sick characters , I read a comment by Scorsese that he did n't like any of the characters in the movie and wished he could have killed off all of them , but the studio would n't let him . It shows . He invented these people from scratch , and they 're all revolting.De Niro is frantic but throughly uninteresting as the villain . And while it 's dragging us through the mud , the movie moralizes all the while that it 's meant to `` educate '' us.This is a bad movie , plain and simple . Mean and nasty , ugly , uninspired , perverted and in a twisted way arrogant , preachy and moralistic . Like filth lecturing you how to be clean . Sorry , Marty , this is scummy junk.Stay away .	-1
The copy of this movie ordered from Just Classic Movies took too long to reach me and the quality of the movie was poor . Looking at it was like looking at an old analog black and white movie in the days of yore when television had no visual acuity . I was sorely disappointed and am torn between returning the product and trashing it .	-1
It has been interesting to compare the new Leonardo & Robert Redford versions of Gatsby with this version . Each approached the book a little differently . This version did explain Gatsby illegal source of his fortune that the other versions just skimmed over .	-1
What an awful movie . Only an anti-American would like this . Tom Cruise is awful . The only bright spot is when Kovic retreats to Mecico . If the sequence were a short film ... it would be a collectible . But the rest is just not good . Kovic yells to his kid brother , `` Love it or Leave it '' ..trust me `` Leave it ''	-1
This is one of my favorite comedies . It 's not for everyone , as you must understand Martin 's unique style of humor . That having been said , the DVD is awful.The transfer is decent , although could have been cleaned up more . Luckily , it 's at least anamorphic widescreen . The sound , while hardly sounding like 5.1 , still sounds decent , as i doubt surround sound was on the mind of film makers in 1979 . Seriously , it 's not Star Wars.Extras ? Fugetaboudit ! NO commentary . NO making-of . NO interviews . Just one delected scene , trailer , and a dumb ukelele lesson.The WORST part ! There are scenes missing ! Perhaps this version of the film is exactly as it was released in the theaters , but i 'm too young to know . However , every time i 've seen it on television , there were scenes not present in this release ... such as the several different people requesting donations from the rich Navin Johnson . In this , you only get the Mexican priest . Where 's the guy who needs new seat covers on his plane ? That scene was classic ! You know , this is the SECOND release of this film on DVD , and they call it an `` Anniversary Edition . '' If they 're going to give it a name like that , they could at least include the cut of the movie with extra scenes added back in . Maybe the commentary and a simple 15-minute making-of is asking too much , but at least give us the material that 's already in the can .	-1
Until Universal gets its act together and releases a proper version of & quot ; The Jerk & quot ; on DVD , there 's really no reason to own this film on DVD . Save the money and get the VHS version. & quot ; The Jerk & quot ; was Steve Martin 's theatrical debut ; he also co-wrote the story . Directed by comedy legend Carl Reiner , & quot ; The Jerk & quot ; does n't really have a proper plot . It 's more a series of gags strung together.Martin is Navin Johnson , who was & quot ; born a poor black child. & quot ; Actually , Navin is the adopted son of an African-American family . The family is dirt poor but happy . On Navin 's 18th birthday he sets off on the road to find fame and fortune . The fame and fortune come after Navin invents the & quot ; opti-grab , & quot ; a handle for eyeglasses . Unfortunately for Navin , his invention causes the user to go cross-eyed.The wonderful Bernadette Peters co-stars as Navin 's trumpet playing girlfriend Marie.For a 2000 release , there really is no excuse for this bare-bones DVD . It is presented in full-screen format , and the print has aged -- badly . Every single scratch is shown in the clarity only DVD can provide . Add to that Dolby Digital 2.0 mono sound and , worst of all , no special features . Nothing . This is a movie screaming out for a special edition release . It 's certainly not worth it to buy this for your home theater system . Save some money and get the VHS version . It probably will actually look better on VHS. & quot ; The Jerk & quot ; is very funny , and a great debut for Steve Martin . It 's a shame the DVD is so poor .	-1
Not bad , except I could n't keep it in my library due to the nudity . Not half as good as The Odessa File . David L. Odom	-1
I have to admit I 've never been a fan of John Hughes . He 's like an icon to many Gen Xers , not necessarily because they all like his films ( many do n't ) , but because he was the quinessential 80 's teenage comedy man . But this film is probably the most overrated one he ever did . I thought it was good when I first saw it , but it 's really tame stuff masquerading as edgy , pointed teen angst . The concept itself could have been interesting ( a day 's detention with 5 typical high school types , the nerd , the spoiled queen , the druggie , the jock , and the `` alternate '' chick ) , and it 's surprising that Hollywood greenlighted a film with no real plot like this one ( Hughes had major pull in those days ) . But the execution is really pedestrian . I especially dislike the ending , in which the alternate chick cleans up and ends up with the jock ( never happen ) , and the druggie and the queen together was even more preposterous . It 's ridiculous . It completely undermines the entire story of the 5 castes of teenagers . There are a few choice moments ( the man who played the principal was quite funny at times ) , and some of the dialogue is decent , but overall it will mainly be remembered for a nostlagia trip for 80 's kids .	-1
I 've never understood the appeal of this film . So Schwarzenegger is in a comedy ... yes , I suppose at one time that was a novel concept . But it 's just not very funny . The highlight for me was a shot of Arnold 's face after a sexual encounter . Aside from that , DeVito does a good job playing a slimeball , with some good lines and a rather funny scene where he is supposed to be running away from the bad guys ... but due to his tiny legs and the suitcase he 's carrying , he can do little more than waddle.I just ca n't recommend it . It 's really light-weight fare . If you want to see a REALLY funny Schwarzenegger movie , see `` True Lies '' . That is definitely a classic .	-1
This was one of the first movies I saw with my now-wife . She wanted to see it because she likes Chris O'Donnell , and I agreed because ... well , it 's one of those things you have to do when you start dating someone . Today I would tell her , & quot ; No way , no Grisham movies . Go with your sister. & quot ; At least I would think about telling her that , before I stuck my tail between my legs and said , & quot ; Coming , dear & quot ; .The movie is about a young lawyer ( O'Donnell ) who sets out to help his racist redneck murderer grandfather ( Gene Hackman ) escape the gas chamber . O'Donnell does this out of some sense of grandfilial duty , and I found myself thinking , wait , I 'm supposed to ROOT for this kid to get this repulsive creature off the hook ? Hackman 's character planted a bomb that killed two little Jewish kids , not the sort of crime you shrug your shoulders over and say , & quot ; Que sera sera & quot ; . That 's the kind of crime the dealther penalty is for.Suffice to say there are reasons why Hackman should n't be executed , but I found the whole scenario kinda flimsy . The whole movie , actually , is pretty flimsy . O'Donnell is perhaps the blandest actor working today , and here he gives as vacant a performance as I 've ever seen . He says every line with virtually no inflection , no modulation in his voice , as though he was mildly sedated ( lucky guy ) . O'Donnell 's boy-next-door looks ( well , boring boy-next-door ) do not make up for his robotic acting . When they make a biopic about Al Gore , O'Donnell gets the part . No idea what my wife sees in him.Hackman is not a boring actor , but this role leaves him few options . With long greasy gray hair and a thicket of beard , Hackman looks like a puffy Willie Nelson . His character is a mean , racist , nasty piece of work , and Hackman is certainly actor enough to pull it off . But he spends too much time yelling and screaming , and that 's all wrong . One of Hackman 's greatest strenghts is projecting menace behind a smile . When Hackman is standing next to you , that arrogant sneer on his face , whispering softly into your ear , that 's when you know you 're in big trouble . Think back to & quot ; No Way Out & quot ; and & quot ; Unforgiven & quot ; , just to give two examples . But get him screaming and waving his arms around and you 've won.Even so , O'Donnell simply can not compete with Hackman on screen . It 's like Mike Tyson taking on Richard Simmons . Maybe Hackman 's histrionics were an attempt to make up for the vaccuum created by O'Donnell.The movie has one redeeming feature , and that is the performance of Bo Jackson . Bo has the small but pivotal role of the prison guard assigned to watch over Hackman , and he 's excellent . Unlike most athletes-turned-actors he does n't overact just to show that he CAN act . He speaks quietly without coming across like an automaton like O'Donnell , yet has enough of a screen presence that he easily hangs with Hackman . I 'm not saying that Bo is ready for King Lear , but he 's a better actor than O'Donnell , and Chris never made the All-Star team AND the Pro Bowl in the same year.So why has n't Bo been in like 30 movies since then ? I got the answer awhile back when I was listening to a sports radio show with Bo as guest . He was so releaxed and happy it made you sick . When asked to describe a typcial day in retirement , Jackson said that he took his kids to school in the morning , played golf with his buddies , ate lunch with his wife , swam a bit , picked up his kids , made dinner for everyone , and then rented a movie or played games with his kids . As content as a man can be . He certainly does n't feel the need to be in boring movies with the likes of Chris O'Donnell . So in addition to pretty much everything else , Bo Knows when to call it quits .	-1
I like Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt , and when I initially viewed this movie , I thought it was fascinating . However , after I was saved in 2004 and having since read and listened through the Bible numerous times , I find the movie not worthy of watching because it portrays heavenly matters in a frivolous manner . Read the Bible and find out just how ridiculous such movies are , they likely tempt God to anger .	-1
I was very disappointed with this movie and was grateful that I purchased it from a bargain bin for only $ 3.00 . Based on the 1934 movie , Death Takes a Holiday , with Frederic March , this movie is pretentious , overly long , boring and even silly in places . Aside from a really bad blond dye job , Brad Pitt seems to sleep walk his way through the proceedings , ( one wonders what the quirky Johnny Depp or earnest Keanu Reeves would have done with this role ) , and Claire Forlani as his love interest is bland and uninteresting with little or no discernible chemistry between the two . The always reliable and highly talented Anthony Hopkins manages to give his always stellar performance with minimal embarrassment . Aside from the 1934 version you can also find a 1971 version with the talented , although unfairly forgotten , Monte Markham which is still superior to this remake .	-1
Ca n't see how anybody who loves the original can rate this pathetic sequal.The worst aspects for me are the casting of a silly little boy as a 'third ' blues brother , the rip off of virtually every plot line from the first movie & amp ; second rate musical interludes from former greats who look & amp ; sound like they 're only in this for the money.Do n't buy this movie please .	-1
The original & quot ; Blues Brothers & quot ; film was an epic comedy . There is something very special about it , as many other reviewers here have expressed . For me , & quot ; The Blues Brothers & quot ; is to comedy what & quot ; Star Wars & quot ; is to sci-fi/adventure . No other film is quite like it , and the key characters have become pop culture icons.I think that the reason for making this film was to try and revive the long-time declining careers of Dan Aykroyd and John Landis . It is very unfortunate they did n't reconsider . & quot ; Blues Brothers 2000 & quot ; tries to maintain a happy-go-lucky feel , but three very important people are missing.As has been said over and over again , John Belushi was fifty percent of the Blues Brothers and therefore ends up sorely missed . Probably the best scene in the movie is the opening , with the stark rendition of & quot ; John the Revelator & quot ; playing while Elwood is released from prison . Elwood waits at the side of the road , unaware that his brother has passed away . It is a shockingly melancholy and very moving way to begin the film . Even more shocking is how hard Aykroyd and Landis strain to make the viewers forget this sadness throughout the remainder of the film.Other key participants missing from this film are the late John Candy and Cab Calloway . Candy provided a lot of laughs in the first film and Calloway provided a lot of heart ( he was , after all , a father figure to Jake and Elwood ) .I have seen some reviews say it is unfair to compare this film with the original . Well , I do n't see how one can NOT compare it -- so much of & quot ; Blues Brothers 2000 & quot ; merely rehashes classic scenes from the first film -- to much poorer effect . Aretha does & quot ; Respect & quot ; in place of & quot ; Think & quot ; , the band again incites the anger of a racist organization , a significant 'revelation ' occurs at a gospel church , etc , etc . If & quot ; 2000 & quot ; had attempted to be it 's own film without relying so heavily on the earlier one , maybe it would 've had a chance to stand on its own.In place of Belushi we have THREE new frontmen -- John Goodman , Joe Morton , and the young kid ( I do n't remember the actor 's name ) . All give it their all ( and Joe Morton is actually a pretty good singer ) , but it 's really a lost cause .	-1
Blues Brothers is considered one of the Great American Movies - it reintroduced one of America 's original music styles to a new generation in the context of a hilarious movie . But Blues Brothers 2000 ? Well , the replacements for John Belushi fall very short . The plot is awful . The story does n't hold together.The one thing going for it is the amount of musicians introduced . If the original movie brought 8 or 9 musicians to mass appeal , this introduced 15 . Unfortunately , it was all in a monster jam at the end.You 're better off just buying the sound track .	-1
`` Street Fighter '' is a fun , campy , endearing film , one I have a soft spot for -- but this Blu-ray by Universal is an edge enhanced , color-void mess that somehow manages to look even worse than their `` Army of Darkness '' Blu-ray . Avoid this crap.If you love the film enough to warrant the purchase , buy the German Blu-ray from Amazon [ dot ] de , which was put out by Sony . Visit caps-a-holic ( Google it ) to see a comparison between the two Blu-rays ; Sony 's was brilliantly handled , Universal 's is not even worthy of squatting a turd on.Universal , quit destroying your catalog films .	-1
One of the greatest video game fighters in history , excluding Mortal Kombat , Street Fighter 's popularity eventually produced excitment for a feature film , even starring Jean Claude . The result , a bomb.Fortunately , Street Fighter is not even as bad as the 2nd Mortal Kombat movie , but it is still pretty poor . I have tried really really hard to enjoy this movie , especially since just about all the Street Fighter characters are in the film and stay fairly close to their video game identities , but the ridiculousy dumb humor , crappy acting , and lack of any good-looking action forces the film to suffer . Jean Claude even looks weak in this film , but compared to the other actors , they still manage to make him look good . The story is weak too , with a lot of nonsense to kill time in what is already a short movie , not even an hour and half . The only highlight is the fight between Bison and Guile ( Van Damme ) , where they actually use some moves from the video game such as Bison 's elevation ability and Guile 's flash kicks . Unfortunately , editing does n't make the fight look very real at all.I only like this movie because I love the video game , and this is the only movie made with these guys , that is not animated . If you do n't enjoy the game , you will most likely hate this movie . If you love Van Damme , this is one of his weakest entries . Only obsessed Street Fighter fans will want this film .	-1
I was tricked into watching this movie , I swear . My friends told me I was going to see `` Forrest Gump '' , but I saw this in the theaters instead . They taped me to the seat and made me watch `` Street Fighter '' , a movie I want to forget so much . It haunts me when I see E. Honda fighting Zangief like Godzilla monsters in my dreams . I am forever haunted with Van Damme movies .	-1
There is something cartoonish about Amistad . If social malefactors in real life had evil , cunning and opportunism so obviously stamped on their features , broad layers of the population would have no difficulty , as they do , in sorting out their friends from their enemies . Several processes seem to have been at work in producing this failed artistic result . No one has ever suggested , in the first place , that Spielberg was a profound thinker or an artist of unlimited talent . It is not the director 's fault , naturally , but the phenomenal success of his films over the past two decades has undoubtedly been bound up with social and artistic processes of a rather retrograde character . As a result , almost all of Spielberg 's films and the conceptions they embody are truly childish , not 'child-like ' . But there is another critical element which must be added into the mix when considering the specific failings of Amistad : the truly deleterious impact of ` political correctness ' on artistic work . Nearly every aspect of the film reveals a desperation , a mania almost , to satisfy the strangle hold political correctness has over much of society . It is in this light that one has to view the film 's extremely idealized portrayal of the Africans . The treatment of slavery itself as an historical phenomenon also suffers . Very little matter-of-fact analysis occurs in Amistad . The director is determined to focus the spectator 's attention on the horrors of the situation at every moment for fear of being accused of insensitivity to the suffering of the slaves . Under those conditions , where events and people are depicted as they & quot ; should & quot ; have been and not as they were , the possibility of an objective historical accounting , as well as the possibility of the artist being honest with himself goes out the window . We are left with a stilted , distorted picture , arranged so as not to offend . The fact is , nothing but intellectual harm has come from the influence of political correctness . Amistad demonstrates this .	-1
This movie would have succeeded if it had starred Eddie Murphy , Richard Pryor , Steve Martin , Leslie Nielson and Dan Ackroyd . It 's so appallingly acted , scripted and directed that it amounts to a laughable parody of a 'serious ' subject matter . An exercise in sickly false sentiment with the requisite maudlin musical score that has become Spielberg 's unmistakable trademark.It is really nothing more than a boring - and equally badly made - derivative of the TV mini-series 'Roots ' that was inflicted on us some 20 years ago . A cynical and inevitably failed attempt by Spielberg to gain recognition , legitimacy , and status as an auteur filmmaker . He should stick to what he does best : catering to his uncritical and adoring fans .	-1
Full of stereotypes , cliches and bad acting . This movie relies on the viewer having a strong sense of entitlement and thus being aloof of the less than subtle insults aimed at caucasians . The film notes the African 's language had not developed abstract words such as `` if '' . The script tells us the Africans are morally superior and thus their language does not need the word `` IF '' . Because `` you either do something or you do n't '' , the African leader sagely informs us . Who are the buffoons in this film ? The Christians who devote their time to protest against slavery are depicted as useless and referred to as `` those miserable people '' . Good music , scenery , and comic relief were not featured in this film .	-1
`` A critic is someone with no legs who gives dance lessons . `` Most of us who review these movies have no training to do so.We know what we like and do n't like , what we expect in movies , and we try to communicate our reactions in some graspablelanguage , either to show off a little or to stimulate someoneto watch or avoid a film.Like all of the arts , cinema has a history , and an awarenesss of it , going into a theatre , is critical to a valid evaluation - a review thathas any merit.I thought that this was a horrid , mean-spirited movie , withouthumor , or a point of observation that I could appreciate fromany angle , except this one : Sometimes there are kernels ofhope in even the lowest of appearances . Richard Linklaterand some of the actors have done better work since.There are many far better school movies to watch , includingLinklater 's own `` School of Rock. `` And also `` BlackboardJungle `` , `` Elephant `` , `` even `` Real Women Have Curves . `` The meanness I refer to may have been commonplace inhigh schools , and apparently it still is . But the taunting ofunderclassmen shown here is supposed to be farcical , I think , and is n't . A senior chasing a boy to spank him , rightup to his front door , and then shouting , `` Your ass is mine ! You 're dead ! `` , et al , after the kid has scuttled in safely behindhis mother 's drawn weapon just sits in the brain like roadrage.See `` Elephant `` instead . The taunting and bullying that somestudents have endured is consequential , if abhorrent . The directorhad a conscience. `` Elephant `` is far more than just a reminderof what it was like to be in high school thrown together with some hot contemporary songs . It 's a responsible exercise in film as art , and not as fast food .	-1
I am sure if you are reading the reviews for this movie you probably know what it is about , if not there are other reviews that cover the movie itself . ( grab soapbox , put it on the ground , climb on it ) I am here to talk about the ripoff of companies releasing several different versions of DVD 's . All of them have a little tiny bit of an interesting extra feature but none of them have enough to justify the extra money charged . This is a blatant attempt to get the consumer to pay a lot of money for very little reason . This DVD has almost nothing to make it worth the extra $ 15 you have to pay . There are some mildly amusing moments in the extra features but nothing of substance . Stick with your old copy or buy it cheaper if you really must have it . ( get off of soapbox , pick it up , put it away ) Dazed and Confused is a hilarious movie and worth watching every time . The extra features on this DVD are not worth paying extra for .	-1
I hated this movie . It had no storyline or plot whatsoever . I do n't mean its plot was thin or needed work ; it did n't even try to have a plot in the first place . All that happens is these kids hang around , get stoned , and do nothing all day . That 's basically the whole movie . I found it to be just a bunch of nihilistic trash .	-1
I suppose I could give it more stars for the sake of it 's technical merits and acting but then I would feel guilty lending something like approval to it 's representation of Believers in Christ . But I saw nothing in the film worthy of the truth in Christ . What I saw was a representation of a gospel aimed at sensual gratification in the name of the Lord . A gospel that avoided entirely any exploration of the spiritual message of the Bible ! Although I am not surprised really that people loved this movie , it does however sadden me greatly that so many actually see an `` honest '' representation of the gospel ! Because all I saw was a slice of some of the very worst of Christendom ! Sensual gratification without confronting the truth which is that a person can not do ANYTHING to obtain the mercy of God except that a person might be humbled by God to plead for mercy and might be humbled to seek Him with a broken a heart and might by the sovereign will of God be granted wisdom and knowledge of the truth in the The Lord Jesus Christ according to the Bible ALONE and in it 's entirety . But that is not something given to showing in movies I think Understanding that I really do n't know why I bothered to watch it even ... I do n't know what I thought might come of it and it made me curious what on earth they could come up with so far as showing the viewers some interesting perspective . All I saw was a bunch of deceived people encouraging themselves amongst themselves that they had things right and the profile of one more sinful man at a loss to make sense of his faith and Hypocrisy while seeming to force it on God as good enough as in `` this is what I believe Lord , it is right and thank you that it is right '' Is that humility ? Is it not only pride ? Can we have any confidence in our best thinking ? Or at the end end of day is not vanity ? But what do I know ? Let God be true and every man a liar . Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean NOT on thine own understanding . Lord I believe , help thou my unbelief . In sack cloth and ashes I beat my own chest and beg `` Lord have mercy on me a sinner '' My hope lies only in the mercy of God the Father through the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ ... I stand or I fall according to His perfect will .	-1
I can only say I am happy I rented it first ! This grainy , washed-out , scratch and pop infested theatrical version is the same cheap copy that hit DVD 10 years ago . It 's no improvement over the standard DVD ! Not only that , but with HD a theatrical / directors cut could have been on one disk , restored with ear-splitting sound . NOT HEAR ! DO NOT BUY.WAIT UNTIL THEY RESTORE IT !	-1
Before you read this review , of course I give this movie five stars . I am putting down one star here for a reason . Fox and Miramax are notorious for the double dipping . They release a movie , and then four months to a year later , they release a `` special edition '' with extra bells and whistles , leaving hard core film fans having to spend additional funds on the film they love.When it comes to the double dip , Anchor Bay puts them to shame . For instance , there is their five different releases of the original `` Dawn of the Dead '' , and three releases of `` Day of the Dead '' .With `` Army of Darkness , '' first they had a theatrical version of the film released on DVD . Next , they came out with a `` limited edition '' release of `` Army of Darkness '' packaged with both the theatrical version and the Director 's Cut . Third , they release the `` Army of Darkness '' DVD with a new cover , not bothering to put on the case which version of the film was contained within . Fourth , they release the `` all new 'Army of Darkness : Special Edition ' with new commentary , '' which turned out to be the exact same as the `` limited edition '' version . Fifth , we got the `` Army of Darkness : Director 's Cut '' boasting new scenes , when , in fact , it was the exact same as theDirector 's Cuts in the previous releases . Sixth , we got the `` Bruce Campbell vs . The Army of Darkness ( The Official Bootleg Edition ) '' , which was the exact same as the previous four director 's cut releases.Now , we get the Seventh release , the `` Army of Darkness ( Boomstick Edition ) '' which is no different from any of the other editions . I think somewhere along the way , they added THX sound to the DVD , but for the life of me I ca n't tell you which version that was . The sad thing is , I ( almost ) enjoy the regular version of this film a little better . In the extended version some of the cuts are worse , the final battle goes on a little too long , dialogue is changed , and all of the aditional scenes are on bad film and look horribly out of place . Still , the new ending and the windmill sequince are still far better scenes in the `` director 's cut . '' Then again , I really do enjoy the ending in the theatrical version , just because we get to see Ted Raimi working in S-mart .	-1
IS SO STUPID THAT ID RATHER WATCH HOWARD THE DUCK IN ROTATION . HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FIRST TWO EXCEPT THE BOOK . BRUCE CAMPBELL IS A HORRIBLE ACTOR . UM WHERE WAS BRIDGET FONDA ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
My daughter forced me into watching this one . It was a D- movie that was so bad it was funny .	-1
Picks up where the second left off . Campbell is transported back through time with his chainsaw to the days of black knights and the landscape just happens to be crawling with dead people . He is tasked by the village people to save them against the evil which he excepts on the basis of being sent home directly after . A nice recovery over part 2 is smothered in immature jokes that will have the kiddies laughing their butts off . Not really designed for an R rating , this is plenty safe for children . In fact , one could argue that this was entirely made for children . Older generations wo n't get much of a kick out of this .	-1
It must be a guy thing , because I just did not find this movie amusing . It was over-the-top and ridiculous - and my feeling this way angered my husband greatly .	-1
I have never seen the movie so the rating is only for the product 's quality . The disc did not work for any DVD player I put it in !	-1
I did not like the film . The believability of it just was n't there . I did not understand Jennifer Lopez 's character . The film was cute at certain moments but not worth the money . See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr .	-1
I certainly agree with Roger Ebert on this one . From a movie starring John Candy and Dan Aykroyd , written by John Hughes , you 'd expect to get entertained . `` The Great Outdoors '' does n't deliver . There 's hardly any plot , which could have been excused if there were plenty of funny moments , but there are only very few funny scenes and even those are only mildly amusing and not exactly laugh-out-loud funny . Most of the time the movie is just silly and slow , the plot going nowhere . Considering the talent involved it 's a big disappointment and only worth watching if you 're a very big fan of the stars .	-1
Whether you are an ultra die-hard fan of Van Damme , his bad accent , stupid , plotless movies or all three , this one is for you . Here Van Damme stars a sailor who 's out to rescue some & quot ; good guys & quot ; from some & quot ; bad guys & quot ; . Sounds original huh ? An unintentionally hilarious mess , with not one believable or suspenseful moment .	-1
He hates white people with a passion ( especially Italian-Americans ) , and it shows in this film.So what if Sal wanted Italians on his wall of fame ? That was HIS pizza place , and it was HIS right to have WHOEVER HE WANTED on HIS wall.This film tries very hard , to sell the idea that white people are the enemy.In the last scene ( spoilers ahead ) , Mookie ( Lee ) , throws a garbage can through Sal 's window of his pizza place , and stirs up a riot.This of course , leads to Sal 's being burned down by the angry blacks , that Mookie influened in the first place.Let 's say that this movie was about an Italian-American young man , who worked for an African-American store owner who has a wall of fame of his own , with famous African Americans on it.Say the Italian young man , wanted some white people on his wall of fame.The black store owner says no.African Americans only.Make a long story short.This starts a riot of whites , and a boycott of the black man 's shop.I wonder if this film would still be a so called `` classic '' then ... I hardly think so .	-1
Clint Eastwood rarely stars in a bad movie , but that 's not to say this is bad , it just falls a bit flat . A good cast , including a deliciously villainous Robert Duvall unfortunately fail to lift this picture above mediocrity . Add to this , it 's relatively short running time ( just under 90 minutes ) , fans of the genre , and Clint ( who have been spoiled by great movies before ) will feel a little let down . It 's probably fair to say that a lesser known cast , and director would n't even have got this movie off the cutting room floor . All this said , any Clint collector will probably want it in his/her collection , and the usual amount of dry humor , and Eastwoodesque rationality does make this watchable , if not that memorable .	-1
EVERY THING WENT WELL UNTIL SCENE 16 ! THE DVD FAILED TO PLAYPROPERLY ! I WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE END OF THE MOVIE ! !	-1
OH MY GOODNESS ! I have always thought I would enjoy this movie and when I found it I was happy to finally see the film everyone had been raving about for so long . They were raving alright , stark raving mad ! I can hardly find the words to describe this movie , but I will try . Lackluster , boring , sappy , poorly acted , poorly written , stupid , juvenile , lame , stale and other such adjectives.I am a fan of Jane Seymour but was disappointed to see her character falling in love with the boyish and sappy man played by Christopher Reeves . Whatever happened to the man of Steel ? I ca n't imagine her EVER falling for his boring and babyish persona.I was glad when he died . I found his costume ugly and unbelievable and he acting the worst yet . Why on earth go for someone like that when you have Christopher Plummer around ? Please ! His was the best acting in the film . I still ca n't believe I sat thought the whole thing . I suppose I kept hoping that it would improve . Sadly I was wrong and it continued to serve up the sap.I 'd rather watch 101 Dalmatians .	-1
Time travel movies , more or less , are full of it ; yet , some are enjoyable to watch . This one is probably the least imaginative ever conceived . Hollywood , I know , loved it , because it was cheap to produce -- no fancy gadgets necessary . Just change your clothes and think your way into the future -- what a bunch of glop ! An old lady , who is the love object when she 's young , gives him a watch and tells him to come back to her ; this is where the subtle suicide request comes in.Later in life he breaks up with his girlfriend , falls for a portrait of girl and gets advice from a mentally incompetent professor about thinking yourself into the past . Mental , ly he gets there the first time ; the 2nd attempt costs him his life . He gets to see her alright ... but in the spirit realm -- because he 's dead.So , that 's what the old lady ( who lived her life to a ripe old age ) asked him to do -- to kill himself , so that he could spend eternity with her in the spiritual realm.It 's a tale ( a really big one ) about a very selfish old lady and a very stupid young man.This movie is implausible ; a man shows up out of the blue and immediately wants to make love to a woman in 1912 , and she 's going to allow this to happen -- in 1912 ? Any man attempting such crude , crass and lusty behavior during this period , would have been thrown into jail forever.The guy becomes salacious looking at her picture and then when he meets her wants to commune with her body ? Pardon me , but there 's not an ounce of romance in that act ... not to mention in the entire movie . `` Roman Holiday , '' is a romantic movie . This , is not.This movie is about selfishness , lust and suicide.It ca n't be about anything..	-1
I had to give it one star cause as masterful and moving and as powerfully weepy as this classic is it just keeps making me cry and cry , cry cry cry and cry some more until my head feels broken.Why could n't they just be together forever . Why did Superman look at that penny ! And when I watch this I keep trying to turn it off right before he does so at least they 'll remain entwined til one day together they get embalmed . But I 'm just too captivated to get to the remote to turn it off . Then it happens . He looks and poof , they are ripped asunder and my heart is punished again.Still , one day I 'm going to go to an abandoned movie studio , pace frantically , staring at a Casio watch and keep wishfully wistfully think about the day they made this movie with a 1980 penny in my pocket . Then when i get transported back in time I 'll warn them foolish foolish movie makers not to separate Richard and Elise and they will see my reason and my passion . Then they 'll get the ending right . Then I 'll have that 1980 penny in my pocket cause if i mistakenly glance it at i 'll wo n't go anywhere .	-1
If cameron diaz appeared more often , i would rate this movie five stars ! but you only see her during 59 seconds , there is no story do n't buy this unless you collect Cameron 's movieslike I do.u	-1
Watch out for heavily edited videotapes of classic W.C. Fields films . This is one of a series of such films , originally about 90 minutes in length , that have been trimmed back to 60 minutes , probably for Saturday kiddie matinees . The cutting appears to be indiscriminate and crucial scenes have been lost.Update : Complete versions of this film are available , as other reviewers have pointed out . Be sure the version you obtain is complete .	-1
A dash of Canadian sci-fi / horror schlock that 's very much a product of its era . James Woods and Deborah Harry ( yes , *that* Deborah Harry ) play a pair of masochistic voyeurs in search of a new thrill , which they find in the form of a pirated snuff TV station . The plot staggers this way and that , bouncing without pause from '60s comic book cheesiness ( one of the primary foils is dubbed Professor Brian Oblivion ) to insane , grotesque '80s gore effects ( Woods 's character sprouts a jumbo-sized vulva in his chest , then feeds it videotapes ) . For roughly the first thirty minutes it 's actually a legitimate , if silly , gripe about the dangers of an over-stimulated society , but once its imagery begins to venture into the surreal it really loses the plot . Woods 's abdominal slit is just the tip of the iceberg . Occasionally enjoyable as a ridiculous display of bad taste and hilarious special effects , it grossly belabors its only point and fails to reward courageous viewers with the first hint of a resolution .	-1
Max Renn ( James Woods ) , the head programmer for a cable TV station that specializes in sleaze , thinks he is on to the next big thing when he discovers `` Videodrome '' , a show containing no plot and non-stop violence . However , Renn soon discovers that `` Videodrome '' was created by a group of right-wing extremists who wish to kill `` the sort of scum who would watch something like that '' and gains first-hand knowledge of the consequences of watching `` Videodrome '' , including frightening hallucinations and death.Given the popularity of movies such as `` Saw '' and `` Hostel '' , the central idea of `` Videodrome '' , that of someone wanting to kill the sort of people who would watch `` gore porn '' , is still very relevant , in spite of the fact that over 25 years have passed since its release . Watching this film in the context of our modern reality brings a whole new dimension to this film , above that which writer/director David Cronenberg probably originally intended , and because of that , I did find myself appreciating aspects of this film . However , overall , I was disappointed by `` Videodrome '' . As the film progresses ( and Woods hallucinates more and more ) , in becomes increasingly incoherent ; the supposedly `` disturbing '' special effects seem unimpressive compared with what modern audiences would be used to ; and although the subject matter was original when this film was made , subsequent movies ( such as the Spanish movie `` Tesis '' ) have better dealt with it . I am glad that I watched this movie , but its short-comings make it unlikely that I will ever watch it again .	-1
This is one of those movies that can suck you into it it 's story waiting to see what happens next , and then literally shoots itself in the head in the end . The story is about a guy who runs a small-time TV station who is looking to provide viewers with something they can not get from any other cable company . He and a colleague . stumble upon a mystery broadcast via a satellite that is picking up torture scenes from somewhere , but they do n't know where . The guy thinks what he see 's is what people would pay to watch , so he tries to track down the source to buy the rights to broadcast it . He soon finds he is in over his head when he begins to discover the mysteries of these broadcasts , and the effects they when you view it.It was a bit of a slow start , but it picked up in the middle . It 's effects are decent for the time-period and it has some decent gore scenes for fans of it , but I would n't call this a gore movie . Nor would I call it a perverse movie , as many have said . It 's more the story OF a perverse man , but you do n't really see anything all that perverse , at least , not what today 's audience would call perverted anyway . Maybe in 1983 it might have been , however there where way more perverse and shocking movies way before this one was made . ( try Bad Boy Bubby ) What ruined it for me was the ending . It just fell flat on it 's face , and ruined what other wise could have been a terrific movie all around . But it was so anticlimactic that I do n't care if I never see it ever again now . I must say tho , Jack Creley had a decent performance . I actually thought he was Vincent Price , and i 'm sure he was impersonating him . He did a pretty good job of that . The rest of the actors did n't do anything much that would be a huge stand out in the highlights of their career . I see this more as just a cult favorite of those into the directer/producers work or fans of the time who had n't seen something like it before . However , if you are like me and wo n't rate something just because of who is behind it and what they did in their past , then I can only give this movie 2 stars . It would have been 3 and a half had the end of the film not been cut so short and ended with a bang ... or a bigger one than it did .	-1
Videodrome is an interesting film in that it makes absolutly no sense.What it is about is James Woods is the owner of a local cable network that caters mostly to porn and extreme violence . When he finds this fettish show called Videodrome he figures he wants more so he can place it on his network . However he soon starts to hallucinate as a signal in the videodrome has triggered a reaction in his brain that causes him to mutate . Eventually he seeks revenge and desire to start a new race of man.This movie is weird enough as is but what sets it over the top is that can get exceptionally violent and even a little gory . But it 's the sexual undertones that rreally set this apart . You see the videodrome is actually the inner desires of an individual aka sexual desires or what they really want . IN the end though this is winds up being a messed up movie and really is only for a nitch audience . I really ca n't recomend this unless you want something out there that leaves asking more questions than you should be .	-1
Kim Basinger , who has been sprung out of prison after six years , realizes she has to go on one last heist to save her son from kidnappers . What could have been a competent , exciting actioner ( with such such a good cast and occassionally interesting intentions ) is just a substandard mystery-drama that most people wo n't like .	-1
I was at work today , and when I mentioned to a friend that I had watched a boring movie called The Real McCoy the night before , starring Kim Basinger and Val Kilmer , he told me he had watched Crank . Apparently I should have watched Crank , based on what he said . As far as The Real McCoy goes , I explained that it was a pity that Val Kilmer 's character started out as kind of interesting , in a comical way , but then seemed to have no personality about halfway through the film . My friend said `` Is n't that always the case with Val Kilmer ? Heh heh. '' . Joking , maybe , but I did n't feel that was fair . I said : `` What about The Doors ? `` ; Friend : `` Oh yaahhhhh ! That was a great movie ! '' . I said : `` What about The Salton Sea ? `` ; Friend '' `` Oh yaaahhhhhhh ! That was a great movie ! . `` .So , The Real McCoy is not just a Val Kilmer problem . Halfway through the film , everything shuts down . It 's like the film stops all forward momentum , but just keeps going forward anyway . Kilmer simply becomes completely irrelevant to the proceedings , like he 's just following Basinger around while she connects a few dots to get to the end credits.This is a heist picture -- a complex bank heist , to be precise . The complex bank heist is clever , but it requires very little action , just some nifty gadgets , and some repetitous rannygazoo to fake out the cops while the real quasi-action goes down . The thieves even bring along snacks and a thermos of coffee to keep them tided over during the heist -- they 've got that kind of time.Before the heist is the human-interest stuff . Freshly-paroled heistmaster Karen McCoy ( Kim Basinger ) just wants to connect with her young son , who is being kept out of her reach by her estranged hubbie , who told the kid she was dead . She 's saddled with a sweaty , lecherous parole officer who wants favours for allowing her her continued freedom . Then there 's J. T. Barker ( Val Kilmer ) who recognizes her and starts trailing her around like a lovesick guppy , until she finally decides she needs him to help her get her son back -- NOT from her ex-husband anymore , but from a crimeboss she blames for her jail-time , who wants her to pull off one last score , a hit on the Atlanta Union Bank ( which seems to have a sign more suitable to a strip-joint ) . Enter the heist.Basinger looks great ; besides the lecherous parole officer she 's the only thing to really generate any kind of emotional reaction in me ( opposite reactions ) . The action scenes are few and far between . The plot has no delightful zigzags or jolts that get you interested in the scene you 're watching , or the one to come . I find it hard to believe that this is the same director of Ricochet , with Denzel Washington , which is no classic , but plays mind-games , and doles out some gritty action . The Real McCoy makes several promises in the first half hour and then decides it does n't have to keep any of them : no suspense , no romance , no real pyrotechnics during the heist , and to top it all off , a big tiger that obviously does n't know what to do with an appetizing-looking bad guy . Some of the music by Brad Fiedel -- of Terminator fame -- is cool , and Kilmer has some fun at the start , but the movie is entirely too relaxed to function as a thriller . And I ca n't call it a successful comedy , romance , or family drama , by any stretch , so we 're rut-snagged . My friend 's twenty-second description of Crank was more involving than this pillow disguised as a movie .	-1
I watched this movie for the first time in many years the other day and had to come to this board to see the comments . Just as I thought , a lot of guys oogling Jennifer Connelly . And with very good reason . This movie was the worst in the John Hughes collection , but I ca n't tell you why because I did n't care a thing about the plot or the lead male character or the robbers or even John Candy , of whom I was a very big fan . I just know that Jennifer Connelly is an absolute doll in this movie , whether it be on roller skates or on a mechanical dime-store horse ( especially a mechanical dime-store horse ) . In fact I think she comes across sexier here than she does in The Hot Spot , where she shows even more of her assets.Alas , today Jennifer Connelly has gone the way of Calista Flockhart and lost the babyfat and become a serious actress , even carting home an Oscar , but her role in Career Opportunities will be the one remembered by fans years from now .	-1
Balto is one of the most amazing animated features of all time , easily ranking with the best of Disney 's efforts such as `` Beauty and the Beast '' and `` The Lion King . '' However , this 1995 animated classic from Universal was buried like a dog bone at the box office , and has n't achieved the popularity it deserves even in the home entertainment market . Perhaps this is the reason that Universal decided to create a remarkably underwhelming DVD version . This is quite possibly the worst DVD I 've ever seen , and I 've seen a lot of DVDs in the two years I 've owned a player.The biggest problem with this release is the movie-to-DVD transfer : not only is it poorly done and grainy , but the DVD executives at Universal decided to release it exclusively in fullscreen pan and scan format with a 1:33:1 aspect ratio which never even comes close to doing the stunning visuals justice . The greatest asset of DVD , even greater than all of the room on each disc for extra features , is the widescreen capability , allowing the film to be experienced at home as it was in theaters , with up to 30 % more picture presented to the left and right of the screen . Fullscreen reformats the film for 1:33:1 televisions and in doing so cops out up to one third of the original widescreen picture , thus diminishing the epic splendor of many shots . As do many animated features , `` Balto '' offers many stunning visual effects that would look absolutely amazing in widescreen , and yet Universal refuses to release the film as it was meant to be seen . I love this movie , and it pains me very greatly to say that as it is , this DVD is n't any better than the original 1996 VHS version I have.The extra features here include a very unthoughtful , low-tech game clearly designed for the youngest children ( although I ca n't imagine that anyone old enough to comprehend the movie would be interested in such a dry , boring game . ) The production notes and cast and crew bios are nothing much either . The only true plus in this area is the theatrical trailer.As if this was not enough , Universal attached a forced-view preview for `` E.T . The Extra Terrestrial '' to the beginning of the DVD , and it must be viewed every time you start the movie . There is no way to skip it , and although `` E.T . '' is one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time , it starts to get on your nerves having to watch the preview EVERY TIME you want to watch Balto.DVD is the home entertainment medium of the future , and is important on several levels . When a DVD disc is made well , it does a number of things : a ) presents the film in question in the best possible picture and sound available , b ) gives the viewer interesting information regarding the film , such as how it was made , c ) entertains the viewer with its extras and d ) does all of this in an easy-to-use , easy-to-navigate , enjoyable system . This DVD is certainly easy to use , but it fails to deliver on all other fronts.With this release , Universal is telling people that the film does not deserve a disc equal to even any decent one on the market today , let alone the best of the best . I have been a loyal fan of this film ever since I first saw it in summer 1995 , and find this highly insulting . They will be receiving a nasty letter from me shortly for this underwhelming disc , and my only hope is that Universal will correct these mistakes in the future with an anamorphic widescreen edition featuring thoughtful , interesting bonuses such as `` The Making of Balto '' and audio commentary . Until then , do n't let the utter horridness of this release stop you from seeing this underrated gem of a movie , which I recommend very highly . The film itself is an amazing five-star work of art in every sense , but sadly its digital debut is dreadfully disappointing ... .	-1
This is a review of the blu ray quality , not of the movie itself.For a catalog title coming from Universal , which typically has high quality transfers and releases , Fear was under whelming . Granted the movie is older , but I felt more could have gone into cleaning it up since it does say remastered ( a lot of grain and dark lighting , even in the bright outdoor scenes ) , and the audio leaves a lot to be desired , as a matter of fact it is downright lousy.The most perplexing thing with the audio is Universal seemed to care or focus more on the soundtrack , which was pretty good , than the actual dialogue , which sounded muffled - I constantly had to raise and lower the volume on my tv at various points because the audio was so underwhelming.It is an upgrade from the DVD version , but considering the price tag , it is a bit to high ( for a catalog title with the flaws this title has ) and I would wait for the price to go down unless you have money to burn and absolutely love this movie .	-1
If you are renting this movie to show to teens , do n't forget there is a super sexy roller coaster scene . It 's a good movie about phsycho teen dating , but there is definitley a sexy scene .	-1
The transfer on the DVD looks like it 's from a laserdisc print . The colors are faded , and the picture is too soft . Also , the disc is non-anamorphic and does n't include any extras . Two thumbs way down for the DVD . This film would be a perfect candidate for a two disc special edition DVD with a remastered picture and sound track .	-1
Academy Award nominations : Picture , Leading Actor-Gary Cooper , Leading Actress-Ingrid Bergmanm , Supporting Actor-Akim Tamiroff , Colored cinematography , Film Editing , Set Design and Original Score.Wins : Supporting Actress-Katina Paxinou.March Boy nominations : Original Score and Supporting Actress-Katina Paxinou.Wins : Colored Cinematography.I can see why For Whom the Bell Tolls has slipped into the vaults of obscurity and is only known by `` movie oovy '' people like me who like to follow stars and awards . Victor Young 's score is very soft , expressive and beautiful and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous -- especially the snow scenes . And I 'll agree that Katina Paxinou definitely deserved her Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for the rough-and-tough-but-gentle-underneath gyspy lady but it was a tough call because Gladys Cooper was equally terrific and packed a great emotional punch as the Pharisee-turned-penitent nun in The Song of Bernadette . But there are several things that detracted me from enjoying the film.It starts out okay but quickly becomes a painfully boring movie to watch . One hour and it was not going anywhere . I kept waiting and waiting for it to pick up and become engaging . Finally towards the end of the second half we get the fight and bridge explosion a la The Bridge on the River Kwai . The movie could easily have been trimmed to two hours instead of three and not harmed the overall structure of the story . Back in the 40 's , 50 's and 60 's three hour epics were often like that -- the director gets so attached to his 'baby ' that he does n't have the nerve to trim and cut when it usually needs it . Of course some stories have to have a slow gradual development to bring all the tension to a dramatic and powerful close but I 'd say such films are few and far between and usually you can tell when there 's been some indulging and incidental , more-than-needed padding.Characters like Pablo would change personality and then magically change back . Was he for them or against them ? Was he the protagonist or the antagonist ? Was he faithful or treacherous ? It 's not adequately explained . I know he 's just a supporting character , the movie is not about him and we as the audience are supposed to just accept some things going on but I still think his character should have been fleshed out a little more . Plus some of the dialogue is extremely repetitive and cringe-inducing `` I will live until I die . '' `` I love you as my father , I love you as my mother , I love you as our unborn children , and I love you as what I hold dearest . And always remember I love you . '' and `` I do n't provoke '' ( Repeated five times . ) And that big grin from ear to ear and cheerful demeanor on Maria 's face as she asks Roberto to show her how to shoot so she can end it all if she is captured by the enemy again -- acting and talking like suicide is the most ordinary and delightful thing in the day -- UUGGGHH ! ! ! ! I found this a problem with the screenplay but the author has to shoulder on most of the blame for that.Ingrid Bergman gives a good solid performance as Maria but to think that this was the same year as Casablanca and she was nominated for Best Leading Actress for this performance instead of Ilsa Lazlo ? ? ? ? What was the Academy smoking ? ? ? ? Thumbs down . Nice photography and music and the climax and ending was well done but I did n't particularly enjoy the journey .	-1
Alex Cox is one of filmdom 's great directors of anarchy . His two brilliant films , `` Sid & Nancy '' and `` Repo Man '' , are high marks in film chaos . The fact that Cox bailed on the film `` Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas '' should have killed the project dead.Terry Gilliam is one of filmdom 's great directors of anarchy . Unlike his predecessor , though , Gilliam lacked the insight to know that writer Hunter S. Thompson 's drug-induced tale of the convergence of a cross-desert road race , a law enforcement convention , and the death of the Sixties was possibly the one truly unfilmable story ever committed to print.Johnny Depp is one of filmdom 's greatest connoisseurs of anarchy . After presiding over the overdose of River Phoenix in his notorious Viper Room , Depp did n't have enough smarts to know that playing a role like Thompson 's that personified the drug mania of that day was probably not a great career move.Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson is one of life 's greatest connoisseurs of anarchy . His outlandish personna forever captured in Garry Trudeau 's Uncle Duke of Doonesbury fame , Thompson must not have been coherent enough to give a thumbs down to the making of this picture . Possibly too many muscle relaxants.In short , my dear reader , `` Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas '' will go down in history with such films as `` Heaven 's Gate '' , `` Howard the Duck '' , and `` Ishtar '' as one of the most poorly thought out exercises in filmmaking ever foisted upon an unsuspecting roll of film.And this is not to point fingers at the makers for their work . Gilliam probably did capture much of the feel of what it is like to hallucinate one 's way through the mirage that is Vegas . Depp may seem eerily like Thompson . The effects , the sense of style , and the ability to project what Thompson endured in those days in which he and his drug pusher lawyer friend , Dr. Gonzo ( Benecio del Toro ) , painted the town puce are faithfully rendered . In all its dexedrine glory , the debauchery is splattered up there on the screen for the masses to eyeball - whether we wish to or not.Folks : There is no plot.There is no sense.There is no restraint.There is no reason for seeing someone else 's self-induced nightmare.Stay far away . Very far away . Preferably , the South Pole .	-1
At the end of Gilliam 's biography you will find links to trailers for his films `` 12 Monkeys '' and `` Brazil '' .	-1
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ( Terry Gilliam , 1998 ) When you get Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro in the same movie , and then get Terry Gilliam to direct it , you set yourself up for an exceptionally high-quality film . When that film is based on the writings of Hunter S. Thompson , you seen almost predestined for true greatness . Why is it , then , that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fails on almost every level ? Simple : because the insanely convoluted script ( the story of the genesis of which is even more insanely convoluted than the script itself ) takes Thompson 's bitter , crazed , hysterically funny satire of American life and turns it into a generic , intensely stupid drug comedy . Granted , it 's one with an incredible cast and a usually brilliant director , but make no mistake , 12 Monkeys or Brazil this ain't.Depp plays Raoul Duke , Hunter Thompson 's alter ego , while del Toro is Dr. Gonzo , Thompson 's traveling companion and legal aid . ( I had always assumed Dr. Gonzo to be based on cartoonist Ralph Steadman , thanks to Thompson 's wonderful Kentucky Derby essay , in which Steadman behaves exactly like , well , Dr. Gonzo ; the liner notes inform me that Gonzo is instead based on Oscar Zeta Acosta . ) They roll into Vegas to cover the Mint 400 , a dirt-bike race , and miss everything but the very start thanks to their heavy ingestion of controlled ( and uncontrolled ) substances . After losing Gonzo along the way , Duke flees Vegas , only to find out , when he calls Gonzo from a pay phone , that Gonzo has set him up another assignment -- covering a police convention focused on what we now know as the War on Drugs . There 's a potential vein of humor here that can not be overstated . Somehow , Gilliam 's ( and Tony Girsoni 's and Tod Davies ' and Alex Cox 's ) script misses it entirely.It 's impossible to watch Johnny Depp on a screen and not like him , but this is about as close as I 've ever come . ( Okay , it 's tied with Secret Window . ) And I 've seen del Toro play drugged-out maniacs before and liked it a lot better . Usually , either of them can save even the most wooden script , though I admit even del Toro 's remarkable talent could n't help The Way of the Gun . So what went wrong here ? I think a great deal of the problem is that Gilliam , in both the script ( though how much of it he 's actually responsible for we 'll probably never know ) and the direction , takes Thompson 's source material far too seriously . ( It 's telling that the funniest line in the movie was actually ad-libbed by Gary Busey . ) Fifteen minutes in , the movie has already become repetitive -- take drugs . Attempt to be funny . Take drugs . Attempt to be funny . Repeat ad nauseam , sometimes literally . All the ingredients are here for this to have been a great movie . There 's a cast of thousands , many of whom are instantly recognizable ( aside from the above , Harry Dean Stanton , Ellen Barkin , Verne Troyer , Tim Thomerson , Christina Ricci , Laraine Newman , Michael Jeter , Penn Jillette , Christopher Meloni , Lyle Lovett , and many others put in small appearances ) . There 's a fantastic book at the heart of this . There 's a brilliant director -- or , at least , one who used to be . ( It 's equally telling that after this , he went silent for a number of years ; his next outing was the critical failure The Brothers Grimm , in 2005 . ) And yet somehow it all went horribly , horribly wrong . Amazon reviewer Jeff Shannon accurately predicted that the movie would `` achieve some modest cult status over the years '' , but for the life of me , I ca n't understand why . *	-1
God , what a cult film that does n't deserve it 's status . A few friends of mine clamored over this , saying `` dude , you have to see it , it 's freaking great '' . For the first 20 minutes , I was right there with them . Great visuals , rolling into Vegas and whatnot . Then they tripped out . Again . And again . And again . And it 's not funny . We 're just as bored and confused as the characters , sitting in their hotel rooms , trying to guess what they did . Wow , that 's a great way to spend 2 hours . A lot of people love this for the drugs , and well , if you 're into that you 'll probably enjoy it too . If you like to pretend your into it , it 'll be even greater for you.The only thing that saves this from a 1 star rating is Depp 's performance , who I must say atleast narrates well .	-1
I have completed the awesome feat of actually watching & quot ; Fear and loathing in Las Vegas & quot ; through and I have conducted a major scientific analysis on this flick . I consulted my neighbors who all happen to be highly esteemed scientists and they provided me with some interesting opinions about what this film might be about . I have to add at this point , that i live in an apartment building inhabited only by sociologists , psychologists , ornithologists and marxists , and i often discuss with them matters of art that seem to escape me . These are the conclusions I gathered from my discussion with them:1 . & quot ; Fear and loathing.. & quot ; actually DOES have a plot . The fact that a spectacularly overwhelming majority of the audience failed to see the plot is besides the point . The same amount of people also failed to understand Einstein 's theory . Be careful though . This does in no respect mean that & quot ; Fear and loathing ... & quot ; is an ingenius film much the same as Einstein couldnt direct a film even though he might 've been a genius . Get it ? Me neither..2. & quot ; Fear and loathing ... & quot ; has as much of a plot as all David Lynch 's films do together . To anyone disputing this or needing it to be explained i recommend the highly succesful detox programm called & quot ; Watch Fear and Loathing again . And Again . Part II & quot ; .3 . & quot ; Fear and loathing.. & quot ; is a state of the art ... art film , which actually is filmed real time by a director seriously suspended in between reality scapes and played by actors who are actually beyond tripped out with the purpose of providing us with a complex and therefore difficult to understand map with the limits of the human mind . It could have been French.4 . & quot ; Fear and Loathing ... & quot ; is NOT a film . It is actually part of a secret government programm aimed at discouraging our youth in experimenting with a plethora of different drugs simoultaneously . Judging from the reviews here though the programm has failed . Your tax dollars at work once again.5 . & quot ; Fear and Loathing ... & quot ; will be undisputably understood when Part Two is released ( Fear and Loathing in Modevideo ) which is due for release in 50 years time . Those alive till then will be awed at the cosmogonic meaning of this film and will ultimately understand how silly they were when they were young and missed the idea because of their naivity.6 . & quot ; Fear and Loathing & quot ; is actually an alien film recovered during a UFO crash in South Siberia . The original has -of course- been kept from the public eye and this an adaptation providing us with a glipse into the alien mindset . Did you notice the scene at the beginning with the reptiles at the bar . Well , WINK ! Do we have to spell it out for ya ? ? ? ? I do admit that the aforementioned analysis theses are somewhat contradicting . But , I must also admit that i consider myself to be intellectually inadequate to pinpoint which one comes closest to the truth . I think that in reality we all are.This is a film to be treasured for the ages . And , to be incomprehended for an equal amount of time . Peace ...	-1
Director cowriter Terry Gilliams adaptation of Hunter S Thompsons infamous pseudobiographical epic of gonzo-journalistic social commentary is a veritable mess from start to finish : an absolutely unwatchable jumble of surrealistic images and uncontrolled self-indulgent perfor mances by leads Johnny Depp fitfully funny as Thompson surrogate Raoul Duke and Beicio Del Toro utterly loathsome as bestial Dr Gonzo.This intellectually bankrupt project does little beyond wallowing , as its characters do , in substance-abused excess .	-1
I wanted to like this movie . I really did . Edgy Barry Levinson-esque camerawork , some truly funny moments , an A-list cast who must have worked for scale , the whole nine yards . But I still could n't get my head around this movie . Vincent Gallo just is n't credible as a revenge-plotting ex-con , though the movie other major plot ( dealing with the dysfunctional family ) works pretty well . The cast backing him up , with the exception of Christina Ricci ( she plays it as well as she can , but her role is just written badly ) , injects some truly fine moments into this film , but a collection of fine moments held together in an awful pit of celluloid does not a good film make . Maybe someone will release an outtakes version ( and cut out the hideous soundtrack , which is basically the guitar solos from Yes songs redone badly ) .	-1
I expected something more from this film . Meryl Streep is always good , so she can not be faulted . She plays a housewife and mother who adores happiness and doing things that are kind and good and loves to be the housewife . She becomes ill with cancer , and her semi-distant daughter , played by Ren & eacute ; e Zellweger , comes home to take care of her . The problem here is that Zellweger is not believable in this role . She is supposed to be a hard-hearted and aggressive New York magazine reporter . She supposedly has a reputation as being very cold and heartless , but she does not give this character any convincing hardness . It is hard to picture Zellweger in any kind of role like that . She is just too sweet . She sometimes rolls her eyes and gets impatient with things , but she just looks too sweet and compassionate to make us believe that she could ever be an aggressive go-getter . William Hurt is Streep 's husband and Zellweger 's father . She idolised him and during her tenure as her mother 's nurse , she learns a lot of unsavoury things about him . The film is very much about her coming to terms with her illusions about the family and what she felt about them . It also is about her coming to terms with who she is , but it is just so mushy . There are no clear cut lines of where this film is trying to go . Naturally Streep dies and all is basically ironed out , but the film is just so ... unmoving . Surprising considering that it was probably made to be a tearjerker , but it fails to be so .	-1
After than I saw Child 's Play 3 , I was hoping than the fourth part , Bride of Chucky it will be another great Chucky movie . Looks like I was very wrong ! Chucky is n't the same anymore , he 's now a lover slave of Jennifer Tilly 's Barbie version . And that ending ... it 's for real ? If that is Child 's Play 4 , I ca n't wait to watch number 5 , Seed of Chucky , brrrrrrr ... .	-1
First of all let me say that after watching Child ? s Play 2 and 1 I got to say that Chuckie was one of the dolls that used to freak me out back when I was a kid . When I heard a new movie was coming to a release I thought I had to see it.Let me tell you that this is n't an horror movie . Sure it has blood but is nothing special or better than the first movie . Why ? Because Chuckie itself is dishonoured this is more like a typical summer flick , it sucks , chuckie in this movie is not even scary anymore . ( OMG HE HAS A BRIDE ! ) Big deal ? NO ! some of the dialogue in this movie made me laugh and same thing happened with the kills , it just did n't feel like an horror movie.The final sequence of the movie was very well made so that 's why my two star rating . If you are a fan of Child 's Play give it a rental , but remember that this is not an HORROR MOVIE . Is laughable . Just what the directors had in mind ? ( Money ) .	-1
Coming back with the reviews of The Childs Play franchise . You have the 1st movie a classic nothing wrong with it you have likeable characters , fast pace an idea of a killer doll that works . The 2nd movie was just a solid sequel Alex Vincent was good again you had a likeable teenage character the 3rd movie was a good sequel & I 'll never understand the hate it gets I liked Justin Whalin as Andy I liked The Military School setting it also wrapped everything up there was no opening left for a sequel . I know Don Mancini said part 3 is his least favorite but dude you went on to direct Seed Of Chucky have you drew any money outside of The Childs Play franchise . It makes me think what did he do for money in between 1991 to 1998 . Anyway Don Mancicni thought going in a more goofy direction would be a great idea . Made on a budget of $ 25 million made $ 50 million directed by Ronny Yu he 'd go on to direct Freddy vs Jason I 'd rather watch Freddy vs Jason than this movie . Stars Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky , Jenifer Tilly as Tiffany Catherine Higel as Jade , Nick Stable as Jesse , John Ritter as Warren Kincaid , Alexis Arqutte as Damien & Gordon Michael Woovett as David . The story is you this lady named Tiffany who bribes a cop to get the doll remains from The Police Evidence Locker . I really do n't know what killed the cop . Tiffany takes the doll home & puts it back together I 'm sorry I do n't like the Leather Face look for Chucky . Then you are introduced to Damien some kind of hency for Tiffany I guess . Then you are introduced to our leads Jesse & Jade Jade 's Uncle who is The Cheif Of Police has his men follow her cause he 's strict on who his Niece dates . You know wht this feels like Scream . Childs Play does n't need to borrow any tricks from Scream . You have Tiffany try to perform voodoo to bring Chucky back & she 's reading Voodoo For Dummies which I guess is trying to be funny & it was n't funny to me the humor in this movie & the next movie is n't funny at all . So you have Tiffany hancuff Damien to the bed Chucky comes back to life takes a pillow sits on it suffocates Damien we find out that Chucky when he was human was Tiffany 's Boyfriend . Tiffany wants to get married Chucky basically refuses Tiffany gets mad throws Chucky in a Play Pen . She buys a girl doll & throws it in The Play Pen Chucky breaks out kills Tiffany in the bath tub Tiffany is brought back as a doll . Then Chucky figures out oh we need to get this Amulet I was buried with in New Jersy . The 1st Childs Play took place in Chicago & this BS about a Amulet I thought the only way to transfer your soul was to the person you 1st told who you really are . Tiffany know Jesse so she has him take 2 dolls to NJ & Jesse takes Jade with her . Warren Jade 's Uncle breaks int the van where Chucky & Tiffany set a trap that fire nails at his face why have John Ritter in this movie for him to be killed & make a referance to Pinhead . That 's another thing being self aware like Scream . You have this cop pull them over he finds pot in the van & Jesse tells Jade to go get some food . That cop is calling in what he found Chucky takes some sheet paper lights it up puts it in the cops gas tank this was the only good part of the movie . Jesse & Jade get the cops death pinned on them . They find out from their friend David that The Police are locking the border & that Jade 's Uncle Warren has gone missing . You have Chucky & Tiffany talking like a real couple which was stupid but I liked where Chucky was going through the radio stations & complains about the current music scene . You have Warren still alive he pops up Chucky finsihes the job . Then you are introduced to this con artist couple who steals Jesse 's money . Then you have Tiffany throw a bottle of champange at the glass ceiling where shardes of glass kill the con artist couple . Jesse & Jade both call David . Chucky proposes to Tiffany they do it & this scene is the only 1 I laughed at . You have David come into the picture they play who done it like Scream . He smells a foul oder finds Waren he takes the gun makes Jesse & Jade pull over some cops drive up David tries to flag them down & he is hit by a Semi & goes off into CGI land . Chucky & Tiffany pop up they tell Jesse to drive . Chucky shoots at the cop cars & they lose them in the persuit . Chucky & Tiffany kill an old couple steal an RV . They tell them about their plan Jesse & Jade cause Chcuky & Tiffany to argue . Jesse hits the break & Chcuky goes out head 1st Jade knocks Tiffany into a hot stove Jesse wreaks The RV . Chcuky takes Jade to get The Amulet Jesse takes the burnt up Tiffany Doll . Jade get the amulet Jesse trades Tiffany for Jade Chucky throws a knife in Jesse 's back Chucky does the soul transfer thing Tiffany stabs Chucky stop him . They start fighting . Chucky stabs Tiffany in the heart . Chucky is knocked in the grave site . A PI shows up . I like this scene where Brad Dourif says `` Go ahead kill me I always come back but dying is such a b it c h ! '' He is shot & killed The PI lets them go then we have an ending that leaves it open for a sequel a doll baby pops out of Tiffany . I 'm sorry that I skipped through the plot I mean it 's a poor sequel they forgot about having likeabl ; e characters characters that felt like normal people in favor of pretty faces . The Tiffany character did nothing for me I 'd rather have Chucky on his own I did n't like the comic relief & self aware route the series took . A self aware movie is n't a bad thing cause I like Scream & Austin Powers 1 & 2 . Brad Dourif is the best part of the movie . The gore is good & that 's it . Ronny Yu I do n't get why they got him to direct he did an alright job . Brad Dourif was good . Jenifer Tilly was hot but not much in the acting department . Nick Stable I did n't care for . Katherine Heighel was n't any good must of been her 1st role . John Ritter was given nothing to do . Gordon Michael Woovett was forgettable . Alexis Arquette was given nothing to do . If they absoultly needed to do a sequel they should 've done it where Andy was an adult married had a kid his wife buys their kid a Good Guy Doll & go from there . This movie also has a featurett I know it 's like 5 minutes but still that 's more than what 2 & 3 has . If you like this movie that 's fine if I do n't like a movie it 's against the movie not against the fans . Every movie has a fan & hater . Bride Of Chucky for me was the beginning of the end	-1

I will nevr understand how people like Chgild play , Leprechaun and nigmare one Elm which all of them suck except for the fourth one and Freddy Versus Jason	-1
A co-worker warned me that this movie was n't very good , but being my usual hard-headed self , I rented it anyway . I should 've listened to him . The movie was basically about an actor who was studying for the part as a cop , and he had to go hang out with one particular cop who was NOT interested in having a partner . There were Asian and Black gang bangers who were the worst criminals on planet Earth , and Fox had time to call his friends to say `` I 'm in the ghetto . '' That one line was pretty much the only time I laughed through the entire film , and that was because he sounded so absolutely lame when he said it . Other than that , this movie was passable . You pretty much know how it 'll start , stop , and end five minutes into it .	-1
The picture is one of the best , however , the recording is one of the worst . It is supposed to be & # 34 ; widescreen & # 34 ; but the picture does not fill the full width of the TV screen and the aspect ratio makes the picture about as large as a thumbnail icon . Look for another version .	-1
I tried very hard to enjoy this film , being a fan of John Carpenter , of the original English version of the film , and of the original book by John Wyndham . Unfortunately it is a very poor effort and for me ranks as John Carpenter 's worst film.Carpenter is the horror/sf/fantasy B-movie great of current times , comparable in many ways with Roger Corman and Val Lewton from the mid 20th century . He has a deft touch and usually manages to turn in a quirkily personal vision which is always worth watching , even if he occasionally loses complete control of his films . Like Corman , he sometimes seems to lack the patience required in order to be a really great director.In his `` The Thing '' he brought the much loved Howard Hawks thriller from the early 50s up to date , and to his credit he made a film which was both original and also more faithful to the book than the earlier effort , but he completely missed the target with `` The Village of the Damned '' .The atmosphere of the original book is all about tension , claustrophobia , and the terror that the people next door in a peaceful village setting are not what they seem . It depends on malevolence and an understated , brooding approach in order to work . Carpenter failed completely to capture this on film , and consequently his `` cuckoos '' are merely nasty and spiteful.They do not have the required air of unstoppable power , authority and - most importantly - intelligence . The frightening thing about the children in both the book and the earlier film was that they were always two or three steps ahead of the adults , toying with them as a human child might unemotionally torment a small animal . The audience , identifying with the adults , should be drawn into the situation and feel personally threatened , but Carpenter did not understand how to achieve this state of threat by understatement . His style is too gory and obvious for this type of film , which needs a more subtle , romantic or gentle hand in order to work . Ron Howard would be the perfect director for this film , precisely because he does not work in the horror genre.Think that sounds silly ? Well imagine this - a version of `` Cocoon '' in which the old people bathe in the `` energised '' water of the pool , but then are `` infected '' by the alien presence which uses them as camouflage to quietly and methodically take over the planet , rather like `` Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' . THAT is the sort of atmosphere that this film should have had , but completely missed.Apart from that , there are also some gaping continuity holes in the script , and some truly absurd scenes that do not advance the action - evidence of Carpenter 's typical haste and lack of patience with his films . What a shame that this was Christopher Reeves ' last film role .	-1
This crime drama about a troubled , confused teen boy has some well-done elements but the overall result isn ` t too exciting or innovative . Strike is a young dealer living in a dangerous and claustrophobic neighborhood , and as he becomes more involved with some bad influences his problems start to increase and leaving him in a difficult situation.Director Spike Lee uses a typical murder mystery to offer some insight into this NY community , showcasing their connections and relations . There are some stylish and edgy camera angles , the acting is generally convincent and the characters complex enough ( even if a bit stereotyped ) , but the movie is ultimately too long , the pacing slow , the plot unsurprising , the score melodramatic and the ending a bit weak and forced.So , despite some good moments , & quot ; Clockers & quot ; could have been more developed and edgier , since most of the picture offers nothing that hasn ` t been shown in some TV series out there . Passable entertainment .	-1
The lack of Liam neeson and raimi 's directing is what ruined this movie for me . While Mr. Vasloo is superb in his taking on the burden of the Liam created character and mr. Drake always has appeal , the movie as a whole needed a much better script . It was too predicatble , too phoney.On the bonus side , they did manage to keep the hapahazard and crazy comments Darkman makes during chases and fight scenes in tact , so that was a plus .	-1
For all its notoriously explicit subject matter - the story of an affair between two famous writers on sexuality , Anais Nin and Henry Miller , the film features many heterosexual and lesbian couplings , mini-orgies , screenings of period pornography , scenes in bordellos etc . - 'Henry And June ' does n't further the Hollywood biopic beyond the reductive absurdities of the 1930s and 40s . Throughout , the film 's grinding ( DEFINITELY no pun intended ) and endless 130 minutes , I was irresistably reminded of the mythically silly Curtis Bernhardt film about the Brontes , 'Devotion ' ( 1946 ) , which featured the classic exchange : 'Hello , Dickens ' ; 'Hello , Thackeray ' . Kaufman 's film groans with moments like these , not just in the introduction of characters - 'This is my friend , the writer Henry Miller ... he 'll never be published ' - but in the way locals greet the bohemian leads ( 'Bonjour , Mussyuur Meelur ' 'Sah vah ? ' ) ; the way intellectual discussion is reduced to crass platitudes ; the telegraphed reminders of cultural or historical signposts ( a screening of 'L'Age D'Or ' with mild heckling ; Hitler bleating on the radio ) ; the dopey use of literal montage ( Nin and Miller making love while a pot bubbles , or Hugo plucks the guitar ) .Anais Nin was arguably the first major writer to ask for writing , especially writing about sex , to be written for and by women , from a woman 's point of view and experience , rather than having to make do with the usual hand-me-down male fantasies.The film tries to show this gap between male and female ways of looking , not only by setting up spectacles in which we concentrate on the voyeurs of each sex , and the different way they react to what they see ; but in offering two paralell , gendered narratives . The male story centres on Miller 's attempt to write 'Tropic Of Cancer ' : it is a masculine , linear narrative , which starts with Henry as a hopeless , uncomprehending boor , and ends with the completed manuscript - in other words , a closed narrative leading to quantifiable achievement . Nin 's female narrative is more concerned with savouring and analysing every moment , mixing fantasy , dream and reality - although this narrative supposedly charts her development from curious , child-like bourgeois to sexually experienced woman , Nin teaches Miller more than he can ever give her . This difference is shown in the film by the way her major writing is her Journal , open , unplanned , plotless , a work that can only end with her death.The major problem is that Kaufman does n't dramatise this opposition . He is only concerned with creating atmosphere , a bogus image of a non-existent France in which amiable peasants play musette , do magic tricks and loiter in the streets ; in which orgiastic carnivals drum through the night , and brothels cater to every taste . There is no sense of the deep divisions at the time in France between Right and Left that would lead to the trauma of the Occupation - the protest at the Bunuel film is easily laughed down , whereas in real life it was subjected to fascist vandalism ; the policemen are so amiable as to allow themslves be swallowed by the bohemian fun . There is no attempt to account , for example for what it might be truly like to be a prostitute in such a milieu , shorn of the fantasy - these girls have no life beyond their professional duties . The vapid decor and soft-focus cinematography smothers everything in a smooth glow that makes a delapidated tenement as salubrious as a rich banker 's mansion . And is n't it a bit off that Nin , one of the leading feminist thinkers of the 20th century , is redcued to being a bad poet of the erotic , and a simperingly infantile one at that ( there is little mention of how poor and monotonous a writer Miller truly was - June mockingly compares him to Dostoevsky , but Thurman 's performance is so lamentable it does n't count as a critique ) . What really exposes this film as a sham is its unimaginative treatment of sexuality - in lingering over naked female flesh , and especially in the soft-porn sapphic grappling , the film ignores Nin 's plea and addresses itself to male voyeurs the world over .	-1
This turkey has only two things going for it : a brilliant score by John Williams , and Toshiro Mifune . Otherwise it was a total , messy confusion of boredom . Skip this , and listen to William 's 1942 score isolated ( it 's extraordinary ) or pick up some Kurosawa 's films with Mifune . Otherwise do n't waste your time .	-1
If the book EASY RIDERS , RAGING BULLS is to be believed ( a fun book to read about Hollywood in the 1970 's ) , Steven Spielberg , despite making the colossal blockbusters JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND , envied the success John Landis found with NATIONAL LAMPOON 'S ANIMAL HOUSE.So much so that he made 1941.I was in high school when it came out and I ca n't tell you how much I looked forward to seeing it : Belushi , Aykroyd , John Candy , Spielberg and huge budget of special effects . How could it NOT work ? But it did n't . I even went back to see it again , wondering if I 'd just MISSED all the laughs.The first thing I noticed was that the timing was completely off . The camera does n't let go of anyone who screams . The characters are all buffoons . Like CADDYSHACK , the main characters are uninteresting but , unlike CADDYSHACK , the real comedians do n't break out in their scenes.Maybe Rodney Dangerfield should have been General Stillwell.1941 has its moments . Belushi has a great entrance . Uber-dork Eddie Deezen 's ventriloquist dummy spotting the Jap sub is funny . Aykroyd donning pany hose and two oranges to declare , `` I 'm a bug ! `` Unfortunately , those moments are too few . Most of the time , I would n't think , `` That was funny . '' I thought , `` Wow , that looked expensive . `` But I have to agree with my college roommate from years ago : `` A movie ca n't be all bad that ends with a house falling over a cliff . ''	-1
I mean , from the git-go , Woody Allen is bitching to his analyst about his phobias and issues . You could do worse , though , by watching Analyze This ! BOOOOOOORING ! ! !	-1
... In this movie I want to take out a can of RAID . The ants were ugly and nightmarish . The animation was good . But the way the movie was presented turned me off . There are scenes , especially the decapitation scene , that would give small children nightmares . This film is definately not for small children . The movie even made me squimish . Plus I do not like Woody Allen . He always plays a wimpy , whinny nuerotic . Hearing woody Allen 's voice just grates on my nerves . I gave the movie two stars instead of one because the animation was good .	-1
Steven Spielberg plays executive producer for this cliche-laden , family-friendly sci-fi fairy tale , and it 's got his fingerprints all over it . Loaded with plucky working class heroes , cute anthropomorphic critters , moments of agonizing forced charm and stereotypical corporate villainy , it still might have worked under a craftier director . Instead , a second-rate cast extracts every ounce of ham from a very dimly-written script while they flounder around a slow , dull storyline . The effects work is good for the period , a must since the real stars of the picture are the small , hovering mechanical aliens that drive the plot , but beyond that it 's weak sauce even for a kids ' picture .	-1
Apparently , Peter Berg stars as a college football star whose foster family is killed by Horace Pinker , a deranged killer who worships television . When Pinker is executed , his soul continues to survive in the form of electricity and he travels from body to body . Fun core idea from the mind of Wes Craven really goes nowhere , and though it 's all watchable , it 's not a very satisfying experience .	-1
I know that lots of folks love Wes Craven 's movies ; I just do n't happen to be one of those folks . The only reason I rented this is that someone compared a piece of my artwork to the effects in this movie , and I thought what the heck ? The movie is outrageous , and even a bit funny , but it just did n't do it for me.Let me add , I watch movies to be entertained , not to criticize . I was only about 2 stars entertained by this .	-1
Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a good movie if you 're bored and have nothing else to watch . Its basically a bunch of teenagers going through life . No real plot or anything . There are a few interesting parts , but other then that , this one is just boring .	-1
From the odd choice to have Diana Ross ( who looks about 40 ) in the lead to the bizarre set choices , this film is one that needs to be seen to be believed . Some of the songs are catchy , but that is the sum total in its favor and why I gave it two stars instead of one . Maybe the worst remake I have ever seen .	-1
I could n't let the 2 reviews written be the only ones out here . This is truly one of the worst musicals ever made . I suspect Mr. Lumet only did it because of his mother-in-law ( Lena Horne ) . Everyone involved should be embarassed and ashamed for perpetrating this travesty on one of the greatest films of all time . Luckily , most of those involved never made another movie ... and well they should n't have after this . This is one time I ca n't really blame the director , as he is one of the few good directors still alive and working . But then he had never attempted a musical before , and , thank goodness , has never attempted another . Though I must say , he should have been forced to watch this and do a commentary as retribution . As for the show itself , it has long been forgetten , thankfully , and should stay that way .	-1
The Wiz was a terrible movie . The charisma was shinning , but the acting was crying for most of the story . The behind the scenes footage was more interesting than the movie itself . I was able to find out why in the world this movie was developed in the first place.The Sidney Lumet 's version of The Wiz was not only his vision , but the movie industry 's vision . The industry viewed The Wiz as a testiment to African folklore . The stereotypes of African Urban life/African-American Urban folklore is dismantled due to a lack of understanding of the colliquiallism . The language , aesthetics , and ways of a culture has been seriously damaged here.This corrupts the imagination not only of African/African-American people , but the whole human race . Now , it 's going to take African people to establish their own banks/financing , studios , and distribution system , movie theaters , and networks to outdo the misinterpretions.Sidney Lumet claimed he rather had placed The Wiz in the city because he lived in New York at the time . I do n't think this was his decision alone . I 'm not pointing fingers at Sidney Lumet because the people during those times in the movie industry were only reacting to the way the social , political , and economic climate looked upon African people.The movie was a waste of time and it lost over $ 30 million dollars .	-1
I like Tom Hanks more now than I used to , but I do like some of his earlier films . This , however , is just a piece of junk . It has an incredibly lame story , good actors ( like Hanks , Bruce Dern , and Carrie Fisher ) who are wasted , and who look embarassed to be there , and a plot that goes nowhere . Thank goodness Hanks has moved on from this and become one of the best American actors today . While watching this on tape , I found myself fast forwarding through the movie just to get to a scene with any substance . I 'm just glad I did n't have to see it in a theater . What a waste .	-1
I know that a lot of people really love this movie , but for me it just pushes forced melodramatics in a direction that does n't suit the film or the message at all . Instead of really developing characters ( or ` a ' character ) and giving us a real study of Dian Fossey 's character and motives and inner demons , we are given a blank sheet littered with some colorful acting decisions by the film 's star.The film centers on the work of Dian Fossey , an amateur scientist who pried her way into the mountainous regions of Rwanda to study and eventually protect the gorillas that inhabited it . Witnessing the horrors of poaching , Dian became the name and face behind gorilla preservation , and her actions certainly helped take the creatures off the endangered species list.Still , the film lacks a human element that was needed to give Fossey a real voice.I know this is going to sound like a broad statement , but a major issue I have with 80 's cinema in general is the melodramatic nature of the majority of the films . There seems to be a lack of depth in a lot of what that decade provided us ( there are certainly exceptions to this observation , but as a whole it really was weak ) . ` Gorillas in the Mist ' is n't one of those exceptions . It holds potential , but it meanders in its own values too much and winds up presenting something that feels almost hollow.Fossey herself appears rather one-note . She is passionate in her convictions , but there are no layers presented to help flesh her out entirely . They hint , slightly , to her emotional stance during the ending sequence ( it 's a mere voiceover where you hear her lament about not having a family ) but overall she is n't given much backstory . We are left wondering what her life was like before the gorillas . Why did she feel so consumed by their life and their preservation , at the cost of her own happiness ? What was she running away from ? I remember feeling similar frustrations while watching the documentary ` Grizzly Man ' ( which holds a similar story in many terms ) . I wanted to know more about her , and I felt like the film wasted an opportunity to really do her story and her life justice.I also found some of the films scenes to be unconvincingly overdramatic . I understand that all ` true stories ' are dramatized for greater emotional impact when Hollywood gets a hold of it , but you have to be careful not to go so far that you become unbelievable . I 'm sorry , but there is no way that Fossey would have gotten away with hitting and punching and screaming at Rwandan soldiers and not have been shot and killed ; it just would n't have happened.Alas , Sigourney Weaver does all that she can to make this film palatable , and in most respects she pulls it off ( it 's not an overly remarkable performance , but she is certainly moving ) . Still , it moves like a soap opera in too many moments and it lacks the depth needed to make this a poignant and lasting character study .	-1

One more day 'til it hits the street ... God I hope it 's in anamorphic widescreen ! ~~~~~~~~~~~Edited : It is NOT widescreen anamorphic ! ! ! What a truck load waste of time and energy I spent stretching my neck waiting for this one ! Shows very little care went into this DVD release by the studio . Evidently all they did was reprinting the material they already had from the VHS days and made DVDs out of it . Guess it would n't be as profitable to actually do some work and restore the original film for theatrical release before selling the DVDs for money . I 'd give ZERO star if I could .	-1
While no explicit scenes , the conversations and references to extreme promiscuity , religious hypocrisy and bad-boys ( and girls ) know better story line ; reduces this film to a non-recommendable predictable story . Entertaining only in the occasional situations that development within a close knit group of friends . However , what it portrays about the rising generation is the highest emotional and personal measurement of success is number sexual contacts and financial attainment .	-1

What did I like about this movie ? Well , it has a pretty good soundtrack . We 're treated to stellar tunes from Maxwell , Kenny Lattimore , Faith Evans , and a & quot ; duet & quot ; featuring Lauryn Hill and Bob Marley . In addition , the fashions are impeccable . Nia Long wears expertly-tailored jackets made of the finest wool tweed , and Taye Diggs sports the most dapper of threads which perfectly compliment the buppie lifestyle he leads.But what about the script ? The performances ? And the film 's overall premise ? Near-disaster on all counts . This is possibly the best-looking mediocre movie I 've watched in years . For all that glitters , & quot ; The Best Man & quot ; is less a movie than a flashy advertisment of buppieism . It 's the widescreen equivilent of an E.Lynn Harris novel , and it 's just as superficial . Nothing wrong with showing bruthas and sistas in a positive , professional light . It worked for & quot ; Love Jones. & quot ; It does not work for & quot ; The Best Man. & quot ; Unlike & quot ; Love Jones , & quot ; this film is too slick for its own good , resorting to chick-flick cliches , one-dimensional characters , and unrealistic settings . I mean , how many struggling authors ( Black ones at that ) are able to afford page-out-of-GQ threads and live in these huge , fabulous apartments like Harper Stewart ( Diggs ) ? Also , memo to Nia Long : get some range in your & quot ; performances. & quot ; She has a face pretty enough to light up a screen , but good looks do not a compelling performance make . In virtually every role she 's in , she pouts , rolls her eyes , and raises an accusatory finger at some hapless dude . Not attractive . And there 's the scene in which the fellas let their hair down and engage in guy talk during a card game . What should have come across as a frank and honest discussion on male/female relations is really a slap of unchecked chauvinism . The irritating thing about & quot ; The Best Man & quot ; is that it positions itself as a film far smarter than it really is . The hip soundtrack , smattering of sharp one-liners , and stylish references are there to trick you into thinking that this movie has something important to say . It does n't . For a genuine , gritty , and uncontrived Black-on-Black love story , check out & quot ; Love Jones & quot ; and leave this & quot ; Best Man & quot ; at the altar .	-1
I noticed that there is n't a single one-star review on here . Well , there 's going to be one now . I really think this deserves a negative rating , like -5 stars , but since that is n't an option , I 'll simply have to opt for the lowest available.I did n't really want to watch this movie to begin with but my dear mother wanted to give it a whirl so I figured I 'd just do the same . Afterwards we both agreed that it was a total waste of time that could have been spent in such infinitely more profitable ways . First , the whole occultic aspect was sickening to me ; second , the acting , script , plot , and everything else about the movie was not worth much comment except negatively . Third , pizza is best without mushrooms . In fact , every kind of food is better without mushrooms.Mushrooms and Mummies aside , if you want to watch a good suspense or & quot ; horror & quot ; film try Fredric March 's & quot ; Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde & quot ; or most any Alfred Hitchcock movie . At least those are well-done pieces of artwork as well as masterpieces as far as acting , script , plot , and everything else about them.Thank you for your time .	-1
I 'll keep this short . Who ever made this film had a good idea and turned it into something that would 've never happend . Tyrants do n't think their bad and question themselves in the mirror . Who ever played Hitler played him like an american schoolboy mimicking him during the war . Stay away from this film .	-1
It is a travesty that Amazon.com does not allow 0-stars as an option . Instead , I am saddled with the the false implication that I believe this movie deserves 1 star.This movie is so bad I believe the Big Nurses of the world will be using it as a torture device in nursing homes on old guys that ask for more milk with their corn flakes . It 's embarrassing that there are people out there that regard watching this movie as a turning point in their life . I watched it with a girl who was crying by the end of it . I , on the other hand , sat in utter mortification at the monstrosity I had just endured . All the respect I had for Robin Williams as a result of his standup career and the brilliant ALLADIN was utterly demolished by the sick abortion that is PATCH ADAMS . It 's awfulness is on the scale of a complex multidimensional matrix , thus it would take an entire book to render a just accounting of its abuses of taste and common sense . Only a repressed sadist could derive meaningful pleasure out of experiencing this leviathan of putrescence.Robin Williams ' shameless smorgasborg of vomit-inducing cuteness and its fourth-quarter gambit of pretentious depth is an invaluable tool for anyone who wants to know of what a quintessentially terrible movie consists . Just because it was thought up in a brainstorming session does n't mean a gag ought to be included in a movie . Every dollop of *fun* in this movie is an unfunny and tedious attempt to make the same sanctimonious point over and over : medicine is really about making people laugh , and anyone who does n't believe that is the bad , bad enemy . Thus , the mentality celebrated in this movie is a mindset of total black and white ; religious fanatics and zealots everywhere would feel right at home.Consequently , not only is the Robin Williams shtick totally boring after about -- oh -- two minutes ( & quot ; Look at me , I 'm talking like John Wayne . Whee , are n't we having fun ? & quot ; ) , the pretentious sanctimony and ludicrous profundity of the & quot ; plot & quot ; is totally insulting . Gushing cheeze , drippingly sentimental music , and dramatically phlegmatic appeals of the right to act stupidly and dress tackily is celebrated *over and over and over and over* .	-1
I did n't care for this movie the actor 's we 're not convincing . The story did n't flow , I did n't like all the cusswords . The actors seemed confused and I think they were meant too but still the audience is confused too.I have recently became a Sandra Bullock fan , but I did n't like this character . All the others I have watchedhave been great but this one just misses the mark . But please judge for yourself . You may like it .	-1
I must preface my review by saying I am not a horror fan , but I am a Hitchcock fan so I was n't sure whether I 'd like The Birds . I tried to watch it with an open mind . Even with the dated special effects and annoying electronic bird squawking , it was scary -- especially the scene where they 're trapped in the house just waiting for the next bird attack.However , the script and characters in this film are severely lacking . The romance between Melanie and Mitch is not only far-fetched but annoying . What does he see in her ? I usually disagree with Hitchcock in his choice of women ; he likes the icy blonde ditzes . 'Tippi ' Hedren is a Grace Kelly clone , and I did n't care for Grace Kelly . Worst acting award goes to the girl who plays Cathy . I have never seen a more wooden performance in my life . Amazingly awful . The rest of the characters were n't much better . The mother was scarier than the birds ( sidenote : there are a lot of creepy characters in this movie- the elevator man is another ) , but at least she did n't like Melanie either . Who could like someone with an IQ that low ? `` Hmm , Lydia told me to pick up Cathy from school immediately , but they 're singing a horrible song . Should I rescue her ? No , I 'll smoke a cigarette outside . '' `` Hmm there 's a million birds outside . Let 's go outside children ! '' `` Oh my gosh , the gas station 's exploding and birds are attacking everything ! Let me just go outside and get a better view from this phone-booth ! Ooh , maybe I can open and close the door randomly ! Here come some birds : open . Here comes a man who desperately needs my help : close . '' `` Huh ? I hear vicious birds upstairs ? Why do n't I just explore the house alone ? ! `` Hitchcock overused the green/blue screen in this film . I can understand using it in the scenes with the attacking birds , but for a quick boating trip across the bay ? It makes Hedren seem impossibly prissy . `` No , there 's no way I 'm going to actually get on a boat . There might be some wind that would blow my hair onto my obnoxiously large forehead . I 'll just sit here in the studio . `` I think I was more upset that this movie did n't have a point than that it did n't have an ending , although that did n't help things . It does n't take a genius to write a story with a million loose ends ; it takes a true genius to tie those all together in a believable storyline.You can hyper-analyze this movie if you want and read into it all sorts of deeper meaning and how the bird attacks are symbolic of the women all fighting over Mitch , but I think that 's going too far . I think many times people read too much into films and turn them into something they 're not . ( Though even if the attacks ARE a commentary on the relationship between Melanie and Mitch it still is not a poignant film -- it is too stilted , too wooden , too melodramatic . ) My advice : skip this one and watch Rear Window or The Man Who Knew Too Much instead .	-1
& quot ; The Birds & quot ; may well have scared its audience to death when it was realsed nearly forty years ago . However , unlike Hitchcock 's materpiece & quot ; Psycho , & quot ; it has not aged well at all . & quot ; Psycho & quot ; is still scary , in part , because it was filmed in black and white and essentially looks timeless . Alas , & quot ; The Birds & quot ; was filmed in color and not only are the styles of the times distracting , but the movie 's supposedly menacing title characters look silly . Hitchcock is , of course , is master of creating mood with his camerawork , such as the scene on the park bench in which the birds slowly collect in the background . Unfortunately , they have lost their ability to scare to an audience accustomed to more frightening visuals and thereby the effect just is n't there anymore . There is no doubt that Hitchcock was a genius and that this was one of his biggest triumphs . But today it is interesting mostly as a cultural artifact .	-1
First off , let me give the nerds the afternoon off and pre-spam my review with insensately hostile personal attacks because I have the audacity to have an opinion which differs from those of the herd.And now on to the review.The movie is shockingly bad . It starts off with Tippi Hedren being filmed through vaseline every time the camera lovingly ogles her starry-eyed face . She is a spoiled Paris Hilton type who pretends to work in a pet shop so as to get some face time with a total hosehead who goes in there to buy some birds . This hosehead is supposed to be something to yell for , but instead he has about as much charm as a guy in a hemorrhoid commercial . Tippi then decided to chase this hosebag all the way to a small town , find out about where he lives , rent a boat , slowly make her way across the bay ... The screenwriter should have been taken out and shot for being criminally boring . The movie has an interminable and completely unnecessary and uninteresting `` human interest '' premise which involves Tippi basically stalking hemorrhoid man . The two are destined to be destined for each other . But you , the viewer are simply destined to waste two hours of your life watching this claptrap . Moviegoers must collectively insist on not being bored to death . Movies are supposed to be MORE interesting than real life . That 's why they are called `` entertainment '' .Okay , I owe the movie the sincerest apology . It 's like I 've just suspected : the film is a masterpiece . It 's a message picture . The message is , `` People are garbage ; the birds ca n't take it anymore . The birds must kill . '' It 's just like David Lynch 's The Angriest Dog in the World , only its The Angriest Birds in the Town . I LOVE THIS MOVIE ! ! ! Ok , to recap ... the movie takes far too long to get going . And NONE of the characters are even faintly likeable . But once the birds really take a special dislikin ' ... all hell breaks loose . The scene in which the gas station explodes I dug special . Pure chaos . If I could change my rating I 'd now give the movie four stars , subtracting one star for how mind-bendingly boring the first half of the movie is . But the film is basically Peyton Place with birds attacking . Plus the leading `` man '' has got some kind of Psycho situation going with that battleaxe of a mother of his . He 's a real mamma 's boy . Calls his mother `` Dear . '' So the birds ca n't take it any more and they let loose on the town . And rightly so . The movie ends with the crummy people , now throroughly humbled , quietly mincing off while the birds , who 've taken over , are basically saying , `` Yeah , that 's right : take a walk , buster ! `` The movie is an early prototype of Jurassic Park , which was obviously based directly on The Birds , though nobody seems to have noticed this . In Jurassic Park there are even repeated references to how the dinosaurs are the ancestors of ... you got it : birds . The movie dramatizes some primal expectation that the earth will surge primitive and humans will be bundled off like refugees , like the rabble they secretly know themselves to be . Fan-freaking-tastic ! !	-1

Poor ol ' Hitch . He did n't go out with a bang . I was looking forward to this film so much , considering it was his last film . I thought it would be interesting to see how his style would hold up in 1976 compared to his prime of the 40 's , 50 's , and early 60 's . Even Frenzy from 72 was a far superior film , actually one of my favorites . But I must say I was highly disappointed in this pitiful film . The only good part was the down the hill in the car scene . And Barbara Harris is pretty entertaining lady . Other than that , it was quite hideous . `` Frenzy '' should have been his last flick for sure . The question is , `` Is it a comedy or suspense ? '' Well , unfortunately , neither , because it 's not funny , suspenseful , or even interesting at all . No disrepect though because he is still one of the greatest directors ever ... ..	-1
What do we learn when Hitch returns to London after almost twenty years in the US ? We learn that men are brutes . Also that the real murderers are not the ones that go to jail ( especially in Hitchcock films ) . I have seen 27 of his 30 films in recent months . This is not one of his best nor his worst , but many of them are brilliant .	-1
Without the presence of a sublimely gorgeous Sean Connery ( this film just possibly marks the absolute apex of his unique male presence , even exceeding `` Dr. No '' ) , I would probably never watch this film again except to laugh at some of the scenes that Tippi Hedren 's truly astonishing lack of any acting ability whatsoever unwittingly made so funny.This is definitely not Hitch at his best , particularly compared to his classy , stylish masterworks like Rebecca , Notorious , Shadow of a Doubt , The Man Who Knew Too Much , North by Northwest , Spellbound , To Catch a Thief , and Psycho . Of course , those films were peopled with legends like Ingrid Bergman , Eva Marie Saint , Gregory Peck , Cary Grant , Grace Kelly , Jimmy Stewart , Doris Day , Joseph Cotten , Teresa Wright , James Mason , Martin Landau , etc.The first problem , of course , is Hedren , with her dreadful high voice and not a vestige of thespian talent . Hedren 's simpering would embarrass the star of your high-school play and makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Cate Blanchett . The second problem is an awful script filled with cheap symbolism and impossibly immediate resolution , with bad lines that Hedren 's delivery turns into High Camp . The script and its dramatically challenged female star lumber about like elephants in a tea-room.Connery , to do him credit , gave it his best shot , but how he kept a straight face playing to Hedren and wrapping his mouth around some of these lines is the only truly suspenseful aspect of the film . But even his charisma allied to an intelligent and sincere effort ca n't save the film from the aura of failure that clings to it , from its beknighted star to its clunky script to its painfully obvious backdrops . `` Marnie '' is the story of a young woman ( Hedren ) who makes her living by infiltrating companies as a bookkeeper , and then embezzling their money , changing identities , and moving on to a new location and a new company . As the film opens , Marnie is doing just that : we see her changing suitcases , packing new clothing and accessories , selecting one of several Social Security cards to anchor the next phase of her existence , and rinsing dark dye out of her hair until she lifts a dazzling golden head out of the sink.We also see Marnie paying a visit to her mother in Baltimore , who lives alone and is lame enough to need a cane to walk . It 's clear the relationship between mother and daughter is , shall we say , tricky : the rigid , emotionally cold Mom doles out only grudging bits of affection to her desperately needy daughter - whose career Mom knows nothing about.Then Marnie moves on to her next target , the Rutland Company , located somewhere in Virginia , in horse country , where she gets a nice job sitting about 12 feet from the company safe , whose combination lock the manager ( contrary to every logical rule of security ) is always opening in full view of his employees . When he ca n't remember the combination , which happens twice a day , he shakes his head in full view of the employees , walks back to his desk in full view of his employees , and pulls out the drawer where he keeps the combination and peers into it , muttering the numbers to himself , in full view of his employees . The only wonder here is that Marnie is the first employee to take advantage of the manager 's stupidity and burgle the safe . My old Mum could have done it , easily.But before Marnie ( calling herself Margaret Edgar , Edgar being her real last name ) can get her hands on the goods , she comes to the attention of the Rutland Company 's heir , Mark Rutland ( Connery ) . Attracted to her great legs , blonde looks , and ladylike air , Mark requests her secretarial services over the weekend . As they work , Mark notices several things about Mrs. Edgar : she 's terrified of the color red and of thunderstorms , she shares with him an interest in horses ( horses=sexual sublimation , get it ? get it ? ) , and she 's sexually indifferent to him , something that he is n't used to ( although I ca n't think why . . . : ) ) The intrigued Mark not only begins keeping an eye on Marnie but after he overhears a guest at one of his father 's parties insist that he recognizes her as the beautiful brunette who ran off with his company 's money , decides to to do some detective work . Mark uncovers Marnie 's prior identity and her flight with her former employer 's cash . But rather than turning her in , Mark gives her a choice : marry him or go to jail . If she marries him , he will pay back the money she stole so the case against her is dropped . Marnie is forced to agree to this heinous blackmail , squeaking , `` And then YOU take possession of ME ! ! ! `` As we now know that Marnie has a BIG problem with men and sex , Mark 's `` bargain '' has a deliciously prurient edge due to the absurdity of Marnie quailing before the idea of hooking the handsome , AND rich , AND sympathetic , AND intelligent Rutland ( rut=sex , get it ? get it ? ) in the persona of the staggeringly desirable Connery . To the dismay of his widowed sister-in-law , Lil ( Diane Baker ) , who lives with Mark and his father in their grand home and has been trying to seduce Mark for ages ( that 's men for you : reject them and they chase you ; be too available and you 're invisible ! ) , Mark marries Marnie , giving her an eleven-carat diamond engagement ring . When someone wonders why Mark did n't give Marnie his dead mother 's ring , Lil , who harbors suspicions about Marnie herself , replies sourly , `` He said he wanted her to have something that had never belonged to anyone else . `` Marnie and Mark head off to their wedding night and honeymoon on a luxury ocean liner . Sure enough , Marnie ca n't go through with consummating the marriage - pressured by the eager groom , she goes into a state of catatonic shock at finding herself naked in a stateroom with Sean Connery . ( Well , I 'd have been stunned myself , but . . . ) The shock of being deflowered ( it 's a sure bet that Marnie is a virgin ) by her ( rich gorgeous intelligent ) new husband under these circumstances prompts Marnie to try to drown herself by throwing herself into the liner 's Olympic-sized deck pool . When Mark pulls her out and revives her , he asks her why she did n't just throw herself overboard , to which the choking Marnie replies with this deathless line : `` The point was to kill myself , not feed the fish . `` The script is a minefield of such lines , and while Hedren 's delivery reduces them to hilarity , one can only wonder if even some of Hitch 's formidably talented previous leading ladies could have redeemed them.The film charges to its conclusion as Mark , determined to get to the bottom of Marnie 's fears of red , thunderstorms , sex , and men , tracks down her mother . He discovers that the cold , straitlaced , Bible-totin ' Mrs. Edgar is not a widow at all , but was an unwed teenaged mother who , in order to support her little girl , became a hooker , and one night brought home a drunken sailor ( an early cameo by Bruce Dern ) that the six-year-old Marnie murdered by hitting him over the head with the poker when she saw him struggling with her mother ( hence the limp ) . Needless to say , during this event , much RED blood was spilled , and a THUNDERSTORM was occurring , and Marnie has repressed all memory of the events , presumably including the trial and endless interviews with police and social services . And that , children , as the British say , is how the little white bunny rabbit got its fluffy tail ! In a scene worthy of `` Saturday Night Live '' , after much sturm und drang , Mark brings Marnie home and forces Mrs. Edgar to tell Marnie the truth about what happened that night , as Mom snarls , `` Yew-git-outta-mah-HOWSE ! '' Ditto how , as a result of the murder and the subsequent trial , Mom changed her ways and vowed that if the authorities let her keep the traumatized little Marnie , `` Ah 'd bring ya up decent ! '' I.e. , as a respectable , God-fearin ' , frigid Christian woman who would rather die than have a man touch her - even her lawfully consecrated husband - even when said lawfully consecrated husband is vintage 1964 Sean Connery . `` She 's LUCKY to be that-a way , she 's LUCKY ! '' Mom cries when Mark protests that her daughter is living only half a life.Presto ! Like magic , once the truth is out , Marnie 's problems fade like snow in the sunshine . As they step outside her mother 's little Baltimore row house , against a manifestly fake backdrop of the Delaware River waterfront ( where a thunderstorm has just passed and the sun is now emerging - get it ? get it ? ) , Marnie quivers in that tinny voice , `` Mark , I do n't want to go to jail . I 'd rather stay with you . '' Mark : `` Had you , love ? '' Fadeout.This is one of the worst scripts ever written , way below Hitch 's usual standards . It has the feel of those old paint-by-numbers kits , a sensation sharpened by the hapless Hedren , who ca n't rightly be called an actress at all.Campy to the max , the film deserves all the sneers that have been heaped upon it . However , do watch it once : you 'll be amazed at how some of the funniest lines come in handy over the years . And for you Connery fans , himself at his stunning best makes it worth at least one viewing .	-1
Oh man was this movie a dud . Its hard to believe this is an Alfred Hitchcock film . The film gets an extra star simply for the gorgeous photography and excellent farm house sequence , other than that there is very little to offer with this snooze fest . Newman and Andrews are pretty much wasted as a couple in Berlin posing as spies . They do the best they can with a suspenseless ( a word I thought I would never use when reviewing a Hitchcock film ) story . The whole movie was just so damn lethargic . You do not really care about any of the characters in this movie or what happens to them . Hitchcock would follow this with the far superior Topaz , however , even that film falls short in many areas . The late sixties found Hitch in a slump . He would be right back at his macabre mastery in '71 with the thriller Frenzy . This just happens to be one in the directors catalog that you can skip unless you are intent ( like I was ) on seeing everything Hitchcock has put out .	-1
I 've read a lot of reviews trying to rehabilitate this mid-60 's Hitchcock film from the dustbin into which history has thrown it . The film has all the elements that go into a Hitchcock classic : that high-toned gloss that he perfected in such 50s films as & quot ; Vertigo & quot ; and & quot ; Rear Window & quot ; ; a servicable plot that allows for potential suspense set pieces ; and the sure use of location which made & quot ; Psycho & quot ; , & quot ; North by Northwest & quot ; and & quot ; Vertigo & quot ; so intriguing.But the film is like soda pop left open too long : all the ingredients , no fizz . Hitch 's staging is way off here - the film is slow at the start and it never shakes this lethargy . Paul Newman plays an American scientist defecting , supposedly , to East Berlin and Julie Andrews , his financee , follows him there . There 's no banter or rapport between these two , unlike say Robert Donat and Madeline Carroll in & quot ; The 39 Steps & quot ; or Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in & quot ; North by Northwest. & quot ; Newman looks miserable here ; he 's drawn-in and remote ; naturally , his character has to remain guarded but Newman closes the audience off too . It was rumored that he and Hitchcock frequently fought on the set and Newman , who can be sly and witty , is defensive throughout . He seemed a lot happier working on a prison farm in his subsequent film , & quot ; Cool Hand Luke. & quot ; As for Julie Andrews , she has nothing to do . Hitch sets us up to believe that her pursuing Newman into East Germany will trigger the action but its really an event totally unrelated to her - the murder of Gromek - that sets the story off . While Janet Leigh was cleverly set up as a MacGuffin in & quot ; Psycho & quot ; ; here this strange enervation of Julie Andrews ' role seems like poor plotting ( and the interview scene at Leipzig Univ . a paltry attempt to correct this ) .Hitchcock piles up the bad calls throughout . In his best films , you may have seen how Hitchcock was manipulating the story ( and your emotions ) but his style made it a perverse pleasure - witness Grace Kelly 's breaking into Raymond Burr 's apartment in & quot ; Rear Window. & quot ; Here the wit and style are missing so the suspense mechanisms are laid bare . When Newman is racing against the clock to obtain a secret formula from an East German scientist , you know your heart should be pounding . But all I was thinking was ... you mean that 's it ? Two actors writing mathematical formulas on a blackboard ? And in the big escape from Leipzig , Hitchcock shows that it would take another 28 years , with & quot ; Speed & quot ; , for a bus to be used as a dramatic intensifer.Despite what its defenders claim , & quot ; Torn Curtain & quot ; is a failure ; only the incomprehensible & quot ; Topaz & quot ; is worse . Its not just that this Cold War story seems especially moldly today ; but what really kills it is the lack of any apparent conviction by anyone involved . A couple mildly suspensful scenes - and I 'm sorry , the murder of Gromek is *not* the masterly set-piece that its often claimed to be - do not compensate for this thin gruel . Buy it if you 're a Hitchcock completist but you 're money would be better spent buying a second copy of & quot ; North by Northwest & quot ; ( or & quot ; The Rules of the Game. & quot ; )	-1
Waited a long time to get this movie , and was disapointed in it . If i had been able to find it as rental first i would never have purchased it . Had some excellent funny lines by Ellen though . The best they had cut out and left in the gag reel .	-1
I 've got nothing against comedies . Nothing against dramas . Nothing against Kate Capshaw . But , boy , what a tragedy this movie is ! ! The director was sleeping , I guess , or his paycheck was n't enough for him to make the whole cast to erally act ! ! Everything goes wrong from the word & quot ; go & quot ; , except the first five or ten minutes . after that , it 's a demonstration of everyhting that should not be made in a comedy ( or whatever this movie is ) .	-1
Of the various movies with the title `` LOVE LETTER '' , this is the worst , believe me ! Capshaw 's acting ( or it was her character , maybe she was just doing what was in the screenplay , I do n't know ) is so bad that you simply do n't care at all if she is going to be happy or not at the end of the movie ! ! You simply do n't care also about whre did the love letter came from . The `` shocking '' reevlation that it was written by the lesbian mother of one of the characters do n't make any impact at all , because when we reach that point the movie is lost . I 'm not sure , but it seems to me a classic case of bad diretion more than bad plot . How DREAMWORKS gave the `` go ahead '' for this project is beyond my compreension .	-1
Sorry to be a dissenting voice here , but in my opinion this film is a real mess . I hasten to add that I am a fan of Alfred Hitchcock , Robert Cummings , and Priscilla Lane . They all perform their duties well , and Hitch 's trademark dramatic touch is much in evidence . Unfortunately , the story line seems to have been concocted by a committee of three , with predictably unfocused results . Worst of all , the bad guys are totally unrealistic . They can always be counted on to behave in such a manner as to advance the plot , no matter if it serves their own heinous purposes or not . The movie also descends into preachiness at times , which I suppose can be attributed to the 1942 provenance and the uncertainty of the war 's outcome . I wanted to like `` Saboteur , '' but it fails to deliver the goods .	-1
This 1999 horror film based on the original `` The Haunting '' , is creepy in some ways , but altogether , it 's not really a great film at all . It has good acting , and the scares and pop-outs are clever ( things that boost my rating from a 1 to a 2 ) , with an ending that is n't perfect , but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart . The film moves slow in the beginning , and it starts to pick the pace soon after , and later has it 's intense ending . The film is OK in some ways , but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win , but it still is n't horrible . I liked the house and the setting , though . That was cool . The complete storyline was pretty good , also . If you want some innovative horror from 1999 , I suggest you get `` The Blair Witch Project '' .	-1
This will be referred to as a classic horror in the years ahead ... .a classic horrible example of how Hollywood money can destroy a really good story-line . The plot , what there is of it , bears no resemblance to Shirley Jackson 's psychological horror story . It 's scraps of plots which make no sense , and dead-ends . There 's lots of CGI and special effects , which no doubt were supposed to make up for the missing story . They do n't . Nothing here is scary , unless you find the thought of dusting hilariously ugly wooden cherubs frightening.The sets for the house were the best part , being completely bizarre and unreal and therefore worth seeing . Liam Neeson looks like he was blackmailed into taking the part , and Owen Wilson , with a fixed smirk rather like the afore-mentioned wooden cherubs , acts like he 's in a comedy from the get-go . The women , Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones , manage a little better considering the material they 're given . Zeta-Jones certainly looks good , colorfully tarty and all that , but is n't given anything to do except wander around looking colorfully tarty . Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes look like they 're having fun hamming it up in their roles as the caretakers , but they were probably just happy they had such small parts . This does n't make it as a `` good '' bad movie , and it would n't really worth the trouble hating , except that it butchered a book that was both scary and intelligent .	-1
This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen . The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones ( she is excellent ) . But I mean the other girl in there was so dull , 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS . Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary , because in my opinion this was just horrible .	-1
An audience can forgive anything - except having its intelligence insulted , and this movie does that in spades.Director Jan de Bont bounced straight off of one of the worst cinematic bombs in living memory - Speed 2 - to assault the sensibilities of a paying public with the most over-the-top and unbelievably dumb ghost story ever committed to film ( until Stephen King 's Rose Red ) .The film has two things to its credit : great cinematography , and a fabulous house.Unfortunately , past those two things , everything else is just awful . The all-star cast is completely wasted , except for Lili Taylor , who practically does a one-woman show - co-starring more with the house and special effects than with her flesh-and-blood co-stars - though that is through no fault of her own . The script is shallow and trite , and does n't allow any of the other characters to be more than the most meagre set-dressing . The story is childishly simplistic , and the almost non-stop computer-generated rollercoaster `` horror '' ride that comprises the last half hour would n't scare Scooby Doo in Disneyland . The concluding line - `` It 's all about the family ! '' - is genuinely one of the worst unintended howlers in cinema history.Even without Shirley Jackson 's novel or the original 1963 Robert Wise classic to compare it to , this version of The Haunting is just embarrassing . Save your money , and read Jackson 's novel or watch Wise 's film , instead .	-1
It is in movies like these that I really miss poltergeist , the fog , and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare.This movie is good , in the beginning , when it all is n't so complex.But then , after that , the story really gets really complex , and instead , about evil being just evil , it is really about some old fartknocker who is some marble short . In the end of the movie , it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch , and some bad acting as well.No . The effects are so so . But it does n't matter much if you do n't believe in the movie . Trust me , do n't watch this one , its an experience which wo n't be the worst film you 'll ever see . But hardly the best either .	-1
Shirley Jackson 's novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house story ever written , and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film , but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the author , an inferior descendant of the original movie , and an all-around bad ( bad bad bad ! ) motion picture . Alternating between groaningly , achingly terrible and downright silly , 1999 's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire , obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors , fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel , and squanders a talented cast . Not only is it offensive to witness what was done with Shirley Jackson 's work , this is just a rotten waste of time to see .	-1
When I saw the 1963 version of the Haunting , I was 24 and could not sleep well for 3 weeks afterwards . I am now 28 , and saw the new version lately , and could not sleep well afterwards . Not because it was scary , but because this is what modern filmmaking has amounted to.The original is scary , not just because it works more with suggestion and is in black and white , but because we truly feel that the four people in Hill House truly are there..all alone ... in the night ... in the dark . And it rewards you in the end with a quick flash of ( something ! ) that makes you jump out of your seat.In this 1999 version , the house is full of eyepopping color , fun house like rooms , and four blithering idiots inside . ( If Lili Taylor , whom I usually adore , said one more time that Hugh Crain built this beautiful Hill House for the children to enjoy , I was going to reach into the TV and spook her myself . ) The saving grace of the film are the sets . wonderfully elaborate ( until the house grows eyes and growls with the ferocity of a Hanna Barbera cartoon . Also , try not to laugh when the wooden cherubs contort their mouths into round & quot ; O & quot ; s and say , & quot ; NOOO ! & quot ; You 'll be reminded of Mr Bill from Saturday Night Live . ) I am biased of course , and watched this movie rather mournfully , getting wistful whilst thinkinng of Julie Harris and Claire Bloom . I was not against the idea of a remake in the least ... this has always been a favorite tale of mine since I read Shirley Jackson 's novel . I just wish they 'd relied more on the psychological scares , than the cartoonish ones .	-1
Being a fan of horror movies and having never seen the original 1963 film , I found myself eager to catch this remake , which looked interesting from the theatrical trailer . However , I could have never been more mistaken . THE HAUNTING , with its expensive special effects and large budget , looks more like a 'tamed ' episode from TV 's Goosebumps than an actual feature film . What 's worse is that this incredibly dull chiller lacks what many of these types of films require to work ... chills ! Infact , the only scary thing about this flick is how DreamWorks managed to green-light this expensive dud into production . The paper-thin plot finds a psychological researcher tricking a group of people to staying a night at a haunted mansion in hopes of studying them and their reactions . While the cast seems promising , they are surprisingly wasted ... Neeson especially , with Catherine Zeta Jones offering a pretty face to look at , but nothing more . And surprisingly , I never thought that director Jan DeBont could top the horrendous Speed 2 : Cruise Control , but once again I was wrong . All in all , THE HAUNTING was one of 1999 's biggest Hollywood disappointments and , in my opinion , I would seriously consider that you walk passed this one at the video store . DROUGH !	-1
Do computer generated things scare you ? They do n't scare me.Do sets scare you ? They do n't scare me either.I understand that studios ca n't make money re-releasing old classics in theatres because of home video but why spend all that money trying to remake or even surpass something that is obviously the sum of its human parts , all of whom you wo n't or ca n't reuse ? Is n't that like trying to be the first man on the moon - - - -again ? Some scriptwriters and directors could make a biscuit and a glass of milk frightening.They used a super computer called talent.Please reboot .	-1
I thought this movie would be something more , but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie ! I understood that it was n't a jump out horror movie , but more of a psychological thriller thing , and still , no good . Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room , and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring , and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it . But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end , then this is for you .	-1
This movie personifies everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days . The characters are superficial , the plot anemic , and the special effects vastly overused . Liam Neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction . The house is possessed by the spirit of its builder , who hates kids . That is about it . A terrible remake of the original 1963 classic , which was the best horror film ever made . Get the original , and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot .	-1
Director : Jan de BontCast : Lili Taylor , Liam Neeson , Catherine Zeta-Jones , Owen Wilson , Bruce Dern , Marian Seldes , Alix Koromzay , Todd Field , Virginia Madsen.Running Time : 113 minutesRated PG-13 for intense horror sequences and some language.Director Jan De Bont , whose oeuvre includes such other empty exercises as `` Twister , '' `` Speed , '' and `` Speed 2 , '' has joined the short list of directors who have gotten so caught up with the special effects aspect of filmmaking that they have forgetten that a potent script , captivating acting , and superb cinematography is what truly makes a good picture , no matter the genre . After her mother 's death , Eleanor ( Lili Taylor ) is desperate to get over her feelings of despair . Research Scientist Dr . Marrow ( Liam Neeson ) is searching for subjects to participate in a study on sleep disorder , and Eleanor is a perfect candidate . Accepted , she travels to Hill House , the site of an infamous massacre years ago , and meets up with the other subjects of the experiment Theo ( Catherine Zeta-Jones ) and Luke ( Owen Wilson ) . After the usual introductions are done , Dr . Marrow briefs everyone about what they are doing and the purpose of the experiment . After an accident nearly ruins the experiment , Dr . Marrow decides to carry on . That night , strange banging noises haunt Eleanor and Theo as they try to sleep . The next day , she begins to see and experience strange events in the house . Trying to convince Theo and Luke that Dr . Marrow is n't interested in sleep deprivation does n't work , but it brings Eleanor close to a secret that even Dr . Marrow did n't know about and that could bring the house down around them.Taylor stands out in a dull cast of popular professionals -- Liam Neeson is wasted here , and looks mildly embarrassed , Owen Wilson is a ridiculously bad actor who apparently knows how to hit his marks and has some sort of flair for comedy , but he drawls and squeaks his annoying lines to the detriment of the story , and Catherine Zeta-Jones is voluptuous and luscious and is a complete nothing here . When stacked ( quit giggling ! ) up against the much more elegant Claire Bloom from the original , she becomes even more of a piece of flavorless eye candy . Jones prances about in one bizarre costume after another and the few hints she gives that she 's bisexual and interested in Nell are so pointless and watered down that the edginess of that subplot in the original seems to be even more uneasy and profound than before . Not content with cluttering up the story with CGI effects ( virtually all of which are telegraphed by the previews ) , this version also completely bastardizes the story ( i.e. , Shirley Jackson 's ) . Instead of a straightforward paranormal investigation , we get a study of fear masquerading as a study of sleep disorders . The investigator 's wife , who plays such an important part in the novel as a New Age flake who wants to communicate with the spirits , and in the '63 movie as a total skeptic , is completely absent in this version . The psychological tensions of the original book and film are gutted in favor of too-literal CGI FX for the cast to yell at , plus a cause-and-effect karma that make this more of a remake of `` Poltergeist . '' De Bont succeeds in creating a horror film full of eye-candy and lurring moments , yet fails in executing what should have been a much more interesting , terrifying , and effective haunted house thriller .	-1
The last thing I expect when making a purchase having anything to do with the musical Cats is disappointment . I was drawn to this particular DVD as it is labeled as the Commemorative Edition . Great , I 'll get even more for my dollar , right ? Sorry , not the case here.Having seen Cats on Broadway from the second row , the view I was expecting from this video should have been the same . I felt the editing was poor , it seemed choppy . There were songs missing from my stage experience . The actual music quality was better on my old car cassette player . With today 's audio and video home equipment , my neighbors should have been calling me to turn it down . They did n't because the music was worse than the sounds of alley cats down in any City.Since they did not try to change this DVD into a movie like Hollywood does with many Broadway hits , I was looking for a video of the Broadway show.This DVD failed to deliver on so many levels . We had been so excited ... .. Hopefully my warning will allow you to skip our disappointment .	-1
I love cats , T.S . Eliot , Broadway musicals and a lot of Andrew Lloyd Weber 's work . So , I had great expectations for this , especially when someone told me recently how much she and her whole family adored it ! So ... I wondered what was wrong with me when I just did n't get into it . I kept thinking it would get better but finally I stopped trying.I did n't see the original on stage so maybe that 's the problem . Here I 'm just offering my opinion , for whatever it 's worth . I thought the concept was very clever -- -who would have thought to make a musical from Eliot 's work ? Well , perhaps it there had been English subtitles so I could have read the words which were unintelligible to me I would have liked it better.My main complaint was how visually unpleasant it was ! I just did n't find the sight of people dressed up as cats with hideous makeup very watchable . I 'm trying not to say hideous or grotesque ... .but that 's how I saw them . The costumes were ugly , the colors were ugly . There was nothing warm or inviting or beautiful about the whole thing . The music did n't grab me either . Maybe it got better later but I did n't want to bother sitting through any more of it to find out .	-1
Ultimate Edition my foot ! This is not Andrew Lloyd Webber 's London stage play ; this is some bluenose busybody 's version of it ( most of Victoria 's dance is missing , for instance ) . And there 's other things missing of which others have already commented.This edition is an expensive rip-off .	-1
Overrated picture # 10,000 . Again I see a movie the whole world seems to rave about and where others find art I find trash . Seemingly when I discuss my opinion with others , all they will tell me is `` Well wait until your over forty and you 'll get it . '' Look I GET IT ! But if I have to see this movie again at forty it will be too soon . The gimicky story structure infuriated me with its plot device ridden script ( Was it necessary for the neighbor 's father to be gay ? The plotting of the scene where Chris Cooper kisses Spacey was SOOOO cheap ! ) None of the preformances convinced me one bit . I do n't care how many Oscars this one took home , winning an Oscar does not a good film make . If your idea of a good time is seeing Kevin Spacey toss it in the shower and chase little 16 year old cheerleaders , while a closet homosexual next door beats up his son than this flick is for you . I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I 'm ashamed that I sat to the end.This is ORDINARY PEOPLE for the MTV midnight soap opera crowd .	-1
Well , that may not be entirely accurate . I should n't say that this movie was a HUGE disappointment , simply because I went in with no expectations . And am I qualified to fully review ? -- since I was so bored with this film that I walked out of the screening room after an hour ? Maybe not . But I will say this : AM has been called a sharp black comedy , commenting on current American values . I did n't find the film particularly funny or insightful ( sorry folks -- 'King of Comedy ' and 'Little Murders ' w/Elliot Gould still have more to say about American 'values ' than this picture ) ; I did n't find the story particularly compelling ( it reads more like a quiet , suburban soap opera ) ; and the performances did n't quite jell ( the actors all performed as if in different films , seperate from each other ) . To their credit , Spacey ( far better in t.v . 's WISEGUY ) turned in a rather staid performance , but this role was low on energy and believability . And I 'm a huge fan of Benning , but I will say that she gives it her all in a film that is neither creatively photographed nor emotionally gripping , and certainly does n't do her any favors career-wise . All in all , it 's a pretty toothless effort from a group that should have been able to produce something more.And finally , I can say this : even an episode of FOX 's comedy series 'TITUS ' is sharper and more scathing than this weak effort . Personally , I find it a bit insulting that a British director seems to think this script qualified as any sort of legitimate contemporary commentary , especially for someone working inside the 'Hollywood system . ' But I suppose that being a director for the major studios certainly qualifies him as a keen observer of Midwestern values and the human condition . Is it any wonder the Bristish no longer have a legitimate film community ? We should have seen this one coming a long ways away , and turned it back before it reached the shores .	-1
Two stars for actor performances , the production work et al which is great . However the true meat of a movie is the story and this was a case of chopped pork rather than loin . Suburban bored miserable middle aged man , burned out wife who hates him , the terrible temptation he could not resist , disaster . A plot found in a million books and a million magazines , not exactly ground breaking stuff . Not terrible just a little ordinary in my opinion and not really worth the effort .	-1
Written by a Hollywood hack t.v . writer ( Alan Ball ) whose own grade-b sitcom had recently bombed . And so he thinks to himself : Ha ! I 'll try my hand at feature film writing ! Result : A feature film that plays like a grade-b t.v . sitcom.This film completely and totally panders to stereotypical self-righteous liberal values . `` The emptiness of the institution of marriage , the emptiness of child-rearing , the emptiness of capitalism , the emptiness of life itself . '' And also : `` Do n't blame people , the victims of all of this nonsense and insanity . `` This film completely overlooks the fact that not one of its characters ( and I mean CHARACTERS ) even mildly attempts to lift a finger to find themselves out of their morass . Instead , they wallow in it . Not one of these self-indulgent , self-righteous , hedonistic , self-centered , self-absorbed people attempts to critique themselves and look in the mirror . Their problems are the fault of everybody and everything else.So what are we supposed to think , walking out of the movie theatre ... ? Trouble with your marriage ? Get divorced . Trouble with people at work ? Trash them and quit the job . Trouble with life in general ? Retire to your garage and smoke pot.Empty values , empty characters , empty movie .	-1
I suspect the reason this film is so awful is due to studio politics and the compromises that have to be made to get projects off the ground in an increasingly prohibitively expensive medium . Certainly the director Sam Mendes had to abandon his first attempt , probably because the script is such piffle it 's hard to make it work . He gave it his best shot , fair enough . This is n't the truth about America , it 's one script writer 's view of America and judging by his CV he has not done a great deal other than work in sitcom , which says a lot about the structure , approach and choices made in this film . Trite scenes such as the throwing of the plate ( queue canned laughter ) and Benning 's unconvincing behaviour in selling a house for instance . Nothing works or convinces , especially the fatuous notion that a father should be murdered for 'ignoring ' his sibling . I suspect the writer threw in other stuff garnered from 'Sex , Lies And Video Tape ' and a tasteless who-dunnit element in an attempt to make the picture seem familiar and entertaining for the audience . The bottom line was always money , not profundity.I think I 'm right in saying Geffin had a hand in backing this film and there has been talk recently of a 'gay clique ' in Hollywood and it 's influence behind the film'making scenes . I do n't know if that 's the case here but the gay couple are signalled straight away as being the happiest . The film also plugs the usual gay propaganda that anyone who dislikes gays must automatically be in the closet . The scene where such an alleged person punches his son full in the chest for touching a plate is particularly unconvincing and pernicious . The portrayal of the wife and women in general all seems to come from a certain questionable perspective.The so-called spiritual element about the nature of beauty produces an unbelievably laughable scene involving a bag . One character looks at the blood matter of a brain with a hippy dippy stare that seems to say & quot ; Wow man , It 's so bea-u-ti-ful ! & quot ; I can not believe anyone takes these preposterous contrivances with dead birds and the like seriously . It 's palpable nonsense.All this huffing and puffing just for a reactionary 'Wizard Of Oz ' homily about a family picture and 'there 's no place like home . ' The film then proceeds with some sentimental voice-over guff about leaves and the loss of youth . As the camera pulls back over suburbia and the patronising final sentiments are spoken , we can almost hear the film-makers behind the screen giggling & quot ; My God , are they really BUYING all of this ? & quot ; Well , sadly the majority of people are sheep.The reality is that America has oppressed a large number of weaker and poorer countries over the last three decades in the guise of fighting Communism . Very few people seem to be aware of the real horror that has gone on in central America and America 's hand in it , and the third world in general , at the expense and loss of life of the poorest in those societies . America is not the evil of the world but in the light of this enormous suffering and loss of an experience that only comes once to us all , are we really expected to care about the 'suffering ' of Burnham and his wife and their arguments about damaging the sofa ? Americans love this film because very few of them have suffered real injustice in their lives , the kind you suffer if you 're born in Sudan , for instance . A price has been paid for such comforts and Americans should be grateful for the lives they have , and not whinge . Materialism does not necessarily mean a loss of inner worth or that you can deepen your world . Many have been freed to pursue personal expression , such as making drivel like this film . Be grateful for what you have in the time we have left , which in the face of increasing weapon super-technology attainment , may not be long.American Beauty 's sincerity is disingenuous . It flatters to deceive . It 's purpose is to make Americans feel safe and good about themselves so that the people behind it will be successful and make money . There is a machine that has to be fed and a huge amount of talentless people are out there figuring increasingly desperate ways to do so . 'American Beauty ' incapsulates all that is glib , meretricious and plain wrong about modern cinema and as such , in my opinion , it is one of the very worst films ever made .	-1
I believe the only reason anyone thought this movie is good is because they were told to . It gave a very good illusion that it was saying something new or , at least , very , very deep.. but in reality it was just a stereotypical drama that told you which direction to go in ... and of course , because we are so used to being lead this way or that , we go there . We say how deep it was and we say , & quot ; How true . How true. & quot ; It 's too easy to pull something off like American Beauty . It looked real pretty.. but other than that , I was disapointed.And , if you do happen to enjoy Kevin Spacey 's performance , maybe you would like to watch & quot ; The Ref & quot ; , & quot ; Swimming with Sharks & quot ; , or & quot ; The Big Kahuna & quot ; becuase he plays the same exact stellar role in all of them .	-1
Let 's take a break from the sycophancy no doubt inherent in the reviews below ( as in the media ) and cast a critical eye on & quot ; American Beauty & quot ; , shall we ? The most useful method for conducting this analysis is to compare it to the pro-American movie it slyly parodies , & quot ; Forrest Gump. & quot ; This is not the departure it may seem -- -a key image from & quot ; Beauty & quot ; , a trashbag floating about the street , is clearly a backhanded homage to the feather so prominent in & quot ; Gump. & quot ; One of the main characters refers to this image of wind-borne litter as the most beautiful thing he has ever seen , which should confirm the skewed vision of the film . This movie is the anti- & quot ; Gump & quot ; .For those who do n't recall , & quot ; Gump & quot ; exploded on the scene in 1993 , a pro-family , pro-South , pro-America , pro-military movie which absolutely stunned the critics with its success . It portrayed an America in which people were generally kind and decent , no matter how conflicted and unhappy they could be from time to time , usually through the prevalence of drugs , sex , and alcohol abuse . In & quot ; Gump & quot ; , the protagonist , though not hip or savvy , managed to succeed merely by virtue of being a good man , eventually passing on his homespun wisdom to his son.The success of this film no doubt made a big impression on the creative forces behind & quot ; American Beauty , & quot ; for they sought at every turn to craft a successful , critically-acclaimed movie which would be the complete opposite to & quot ; Gump & quot ; in vision.In & quot ; Beauty & quot ; , the & quot ; heroes & quot ; are a middle-aged , pot-smoking pedophile lusting after one of his 16-year-old daughter 's friends ; his dealer , who happens to be dating his daughter ; and the daughter herself , a shrewish little girl who hates her parents ( with some reason ) . The cast is rounded out by a homophobic , latent homosexual Marine Colonel who happens to be the dealer 's dad ( how original for Hollywood ) ; the main character 's hideous whore of a wife ; and the only character in the film with the least bit of humanity , the object of the protagonist 's perverse affection , played with great talent by Mena Suvari.The movie 's plot is an unholy mess , revolving around the protagonist 's mid-life crisis and how it brings about his demise . This is merely a narrative gimmick to allow the director to string together yet another series of scenes depicting how life in the 'burbs is simply hell on earth.This is typical Hollywood Baby Boomer drivel . The only saving grace of this movie is the fantastic performance of Mena Suvari , who brings brass and vulnerability to the portrayal of her character , a normal girl amidst a bunch of fools . Even the normally superb Spacey is wasted on this script , which calls for the audience to identify and sympathize with a character we 'd loathe outside the theater.Do n't believe the hype . & quot ; American Beauty & quot ; is a terrible movie . If you want an indictment of life in suburbia , pick up & quot ; Doing Time on Maple Drive , & quot ; & quot ; Ordinary People , & quot ; or & quot ; The Great Santini & quot ; instead . If you want a movie which is a true reflection of America , pick up & quot ; Forrest Gump. & quot ; Either way , your time will be much better spent than on this piece of Hollywood pap .	-1
The director deserves credit for the usual things a director must do to complete a movie . And my accolades stop there.This is , on my personal list , the # 2 worse movie I 've seen in the last 10 years . If you are a person of morals and think Hollywood is morally bankrupt and celebrate their immorality then this movie is proof of that belief . It is a microcosm of liberalism where all the & quot ; hero & quot ; or & quot ; good & quot ; characters are disfunctional ( drug users , adulterers , liars , blackmailers , voyeurs , etc ) . This movie won Best Picture for one reason -- payback for Forrest Gump which was widely hated by the Hollywood elite for it 's virtues . Watch at your own risk , but be wary of impressionable children and teenagers watching .	-1
this movie failed to live up to the hype for me . perhaps the title is ironic -- the movie wallows in depression , vapidity and numbness . i bet a lot of people have empty lives ; it 's not a lot of fun to watch for two hours nor did this movie bring me any new insights or empathy . spacey is unquestionably a great actor but i found him unappealing and occasionally bordering on repulsive .	-1
As I watched this movie , my reaction went from & quot ; ok , this could still be ok & quot ; to & quot ; nah ... does n't do it for me & quot ; . I know that this is supposed to be a & quot ; dark & quot ; comedy , but I totally found it to be disturbing and I disliked all of the characters . Kevin Spacey 's acting is great , but his character totally going for his daughter 's girlfriend made me sick . I am trying to understand that it can be a fantasy for this middle-aged , exhausted man to lust after a high school girl , but that is called rape usually . I think that in showing all the dysfunction in family life it is a sad commentary instead of something to be revered or laughed at.Do n't waste your time with this movie . If you have never seen it before and want to get it out of curiosity , I beg you to not waste your time because it is not funny or interesting , but truly disturbing .	-1
This film is hard to believe . Although it is well-made and generally sustains interest , it 's message is poisonous.The `` hero '' is a teenage drug peddler . He sees artistic beauty in things like a corpse with its brains blown out.A neighborhood gay couple is portrayed as blissful and well-adjusted ; by comparison the two heterosexual couples are miserable and dysfunctional . One heterosexual father quits his job during his midlife crisis and starts an affair with a high school cheerleader ( ! ! ) ; the other hetero father is a sadistic control-freak . One heterosexual mother is a materialistic adulterous , the other a zombie . Their kids are lost.It is revealed that the reason the one father is such an abusive hate-monger is because he denied his homosexual tendencies all his life.The overall message of the film rings loud and clear : Embrace homosexuality and you 'll be happy , have a normal family and you 'll be miserable.If you 're a homosexual and want encouragement for your chosen lifestyle , then pick up this flick . All others should avoid like the plague .	-1
A shallow steaming heap . Not much happens , in a plot that creeps along aimlessly , at a pace that is almost as boring as it 's characters . But few things imaginable are that boring . Hapless attempts at being shocking , fall flat throughout this mess . Shockless shock , for shock 's sake ( yawn ) . Maybe in the 50 's we could have been shocked . But by now it has all been seen before , certainly more convincingly as well.As flaccid and full of itself , as it 's progressively more narcissistic star . The only shocking thing about this mess is the acclaim and awards it has received.Pity ZERO STARS is not an option , this one qualifies .	-1
Ah , I really should know better than to trust movie trailers . After being subjected to this one several times while sitting in a theater I actually looked forward to catching it on video . I was lead to believe it would be an emotional yet fun love story . Boy , was I ever mislead.Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis do a fantastic job of bringing to life two totally insufferable people . They are supposedly madly in love yet spend 98 % of the movie hurting each other . This does not make for a pleasant viewing experience let me tell you . I felt drained and frustrated after 20 minutes of this and , sadly , it got far worse before it got better . These two needed to sit down and have one decent conversation but instead they spent the movie picking each other apart . Yes , I realize this is *reality* for most people but , really , who wants to spend their free time watching a couple ( albeit a pretty couple ) hash it out for an hour and half ? Not I . My advice ? Steer clear of this one unless you 're desperate to become depressed .	-1
I remember wanting to see this movie when it first came out , thinking that it looked pretty funny . It tells the story about a married couple who , after 15 years of marriage , are wondering whether they should get a divorce or `` keep on truckin ' `` It sounds like an interesting concept , and one that should really interest the viewer , but in my case , it failed.First off , I will admit there are some amusing scenes , and I think with such talented actors as Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer receiving direction from the equally talented director , Rob Reiner , there are a lot of reasons to think this movie will be wonderful . But there are two problems that the movie has that it never seems capable of fixing . First off , the only effective scenes are the couple 's bad times where they are screaming at each other or slamming doors in each others ' faces . The few scenes that are supposed to be `` good times , '' such as how they met and how they got engaged are so lifeless and done with too much nonchalance to really make an impact . The even bigger problem , as the amazon.com review states , is that the two actors just have no chemistry between them . It almost feels like you are watching a date between two people who , through no fault of their own , just do n't mesh well and in the end do n't hit it off.In short , the movie is hoping the viewer roots for them to stay together , but from my perspective , they ca n't go to divorce court soon enough . It was a very good idea that was not projected well , despite some very able and willing talent . If you are a fan of any of the people I mentioned earlier , there are many better movies to seek out , and not many that are worse .	-1
Here we have a visual retelling of every cliche the canon of fantasy has to offer . Unfortunately , & quot ; A New Beginning & quot ; does not examine its cliches and build a meaningful plot out of them , like the first & quot ; Dragonheart & quot ; did . No , this abominable sequel simply strings cliches together and hopes that something will come out of it . It goes without saying that the film is a total failure.The plot , in a nutshell : an Orphaned Stableboy with Big Dreams of Adventure finds his way into the Mysterious Dungeon under a Monastery which serves as home for many Dour Monks . Down in the dungeon , Jeoff finds a Young , Insecure Dragon , Drake ( who looks very much like an ad campaign for Mattel merchandise ) . Meanwhile , Lord Osric , a Sheep-in-Wolf's-Clothing , is appointed chief advisor to the Senile King . He 's all smiles , but is really plotting to rule the kingdom ( serving under a senile king , has n't he already triumphed ? ) . He 's also plotting to conquer the invading & quot ; Teregoths & quot ; ( a Nordic people most often seen in hokey fantasy movies ) . When , against better judgement , Jeoff gets Drake out of the dungeons , Osric sees his chance for fame . Oh , and there 's something about an Ominous Prophecy , a Two-Tailed Comet , a pair of Karate Masters from the Orient ( one of whom is really a Girl-in-Boy's-Clothing ) , and so on.The acting is atrocious . Half of the actors amble about feeling superior to the material . The other half ca n't act , period ( I am reminded of the scene where Lian walks up to the camera , crouches , and speaks directly into the microphone , & quot ; That 's the stable boy we saw before & quot ; ) . During some of the major scenes , I intently studied the stitching on the characters ' robes ( is that ... nylon ! ? ) .Chris Masterson is very much a one-role man : get him a lifetime contract for & quot ; Malcolm in the Middle & quot ; and get on with it.Oh , and the dragon . The dragon is the worst thing yet . For starters , it does n't look like a dragon . It 's too colorful and its hips are too wide , as if it already is an action figure . Thanks to Robby Benson 's efforts , it does n't sound like a dragon either . Unlike Draco , Drake has no personality , no character outside of what the plot provides , no mystique , and no conviction . He is the essence of un-dragon.What seems most insulting is that & quot ; A New Beginning & quot ; goes through the motions of fantasy without even believing in itself . No suspension of disbelief is even remotely possible . What we have here for our viewing pleasure ( and I use the phrase loosely ) is very-much a cash-in , an insipid , pointless movie with neither ( pardon the pun ) heart nor soul . Its soul has been sold to toy companies and public interest groups that strive to make movies bland , but inoffensive . A heart it never had .	-1
Film : ***** | Blu-Ray : ** What a travesty ! `` Out Of Africa '' is such a beautiful film , in so many ways . The Blu-Ray release of `` Out Of Africa '' has been eagerly awaited by fans of the film , who have looked forward to enjoying it anew in high definition . Now , unfortunately , it has arrived on one of the detested Universal Studios `` flipper '' discs ( DVD on one side , Blu-Ray on the other , no label art ) . The results could not be more disappointing.The image is cleaner , sharper and `` better '' than the past DVD versions . But that is due entirely to the vastly better bandwidth , 1080p resolution and improved codecs used for Blu-Ray . There is unfortunately excessive edge sharpening , and overwhelming contrast boost . In fact , the over intense contrast levels accentuate the excessive sharpening , calling attention to ringing and halo effects . Surface detail and skin tones frequently have a smeared and over DNRed quality.The only other major film that has proved as disappointing on Blu-Ray , and for the same reasons ( too much sharpening , too much DNR , too much contrast boost ) , is the much vilified release of `` Gladiator '' . This has led to a rumored re-release and remasterring of `` Gladiator '' . We can only hope that Universal will wake up and do the same with `` Out Of Africa '' .Universal ought to be ashamed of themselves for not taking more care with the Blu-Ray release of such a major catalog title . It really needed to be remastered for Blu-Ray . But if they were going to use the old transfer then someone should have at least done some adjustments . As it is , it looks like they just pulled the file off the shelf and shoved it out the door , and in a plain case with cheesy looking artwork , no booklet , etc . Shame on you Universal !	-1
Here is what I got from the movie : The lead character , Karen , cant marry her true love ( at the time ) , so she settles for his brother who she does n't love and he certainly does n't love her . They move to Africa , Karen wants kids but ca n't have them because of her lovely husband . He cheats on her , and then she cheats on him . After this it all becomes a blur until the end where her lover ( who refused to marry her after she divoced ) has a tragic ordeal , and they try to make me feel sorry for him ? ? ? He was a jerk , her husband was a jerk , and this movie dragged on FOREVER until it you finally got to horrable ending . Why ca n't I give it 0 stars ... .. ?	-1
I purchased the Out of Africa : 25th Anniversay ( Blu-ray/DVD combo ) sold by Outlet Promotions . There was 1 disc - DVD version of movie on one side and the Blu-ray version of movie on the other side . The DVD side worked but the picture quality was not great . The Blu-ray side DID NOT work - as it was trying to load it would freeze , no sound and then stopped trying to load . I took out the disc and re-inserted it , but it did the same thing . I took a Blu-ray disc for another movie I ordered and it loaded and ran perfectly . I have ordered from Amazon for years and this is the first time I had to return a product . The return process has been very easy so far - I have the return label and I shipped the product back today but I have not received my refund yet . When I filled out the INFO to return the defective product , there was NO OPTION to return for a replacment - all I could do is return for a refund . That tells me others have had to return the defective product . My recommendation : DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .	-1
This new blu-ray release is exactly like the last one : a flipper disc with scratches on the dvd side . Case contains only one disc which is identical to the previous release .	-1
Too bad because while the film was formulaic and predictable ( where any sport might have been substituted i.e . fill in if you like : race car driver , boxer , jockey , long distance runner , tennis player , sumo wrestler ) with some tweaks here and there and a shift of focus upon and including some elaborated nuances of the game itself ... hey , where all the drama was driving the film anyway , rather than allowing the cornball romantic interludes to intrude and diminish it ? It might have been a great baseball movie where very few of the genre exist.And Costner , as he proved in Field of Dreams , was just the guy to pull it off at that particular moment in time.An unfortunate missed opportunity sadly lost forever .	-1
Another big mistake for Costner . Maybe he thought that because he made two baseball themed pictures that were popular and well received by critics and audiences he could fool us into enjoying another . Well , this overly long ( more than two mind numbing hours ) , sappy , and sentimental flick was just more than one person can bear . It might have been okay , worthy of two stars , had the picture shaved off half an hour of the tale which was much more a DULL love story than it was about America 's pastime . ( I would prefer a film about the latter , more like The Natural with Robert Redford and Glenn Close ) . Kelly Preston is almost invariably annoying , and this role is no exception . Somehow the relationship between Preston and Costner 's characters are not at all believable and are completely contrived . Dialogue is very ... superficial and what makes it worse is its obvious aims for something more sophisticated than it was . These relationship films are a delicate sort of thing , and it takes a special skill to pull them off . Costner and Preston do n't have the chemistry to make it happen , and the story is just too ... sentimental . Costner 's character , an aging baseball pitcher , is making what will be his last appearance in major league baseball , and while he is on the mound ( and happens to achieve the grandiose no-hitter as an amazing cap to his , of course-cinematically-amazing career ) he reminisces about his relationship with Preston 's character . Earlier on the morning of the game , he is notified by the owner of the team that the team is changing ownership and rather than trade Costner , the owner thinks it would be a graceful time for Costner to bow out of baseball , while he is still at the top . Just after this , Billy ( Costner 's character ) is dumped by Preston 's character , Jane . Naturally this sends the middle-aged softie ( yes , and in all these memories he so generously shares with us for more than two hours of out lives he shows himself to be the kind of guy we all hope to find ... the guy who loves us for who we are , who loves our children from previous relationships , and someone who really needs us ... which is at the heart of the relationship between Billy and Jane . She thinks he does not need her ) into a middle-aged reverie ... looking back on the good times , and sadly , the bad . But this is all just sugar and spice and everything nice ... even the bad times are not THAT bad , and you wo n't feel compelled to feel anything about these people . It is just another glossy , overproduced showcase of vanity .	-1
FOR LOVE OF THE GAME takes you inside the mind of a star baseball pitcher as he plays in what could be the last game of his career . When I saw the picture at the movies it made me think of the book HEAT , the autobiography of pro pitcher Dwight Gooden . FOR LOVE OF THE GAME and HEAT revolve around thoughts of family and career as the man on the mound , considered washed up by some , finds himself in what could be a no-hit game.Gooden had his dying father on his mind as he was getting the ball past the bats on that day in 1996 . FOR LOVE OF THE GAME 's Billy Chapel , played well by Kevin Costner , had thoughts of his late parents . But unfortunately , the film puts too much emphasis on Chapel 's girlfriend , who may be ending their relationship . Are n't girlfriend stories for teenage boys , not 30-something adult men ? Each time FOR LOVE OF THE GAME 's baseball sequences start to engross you , it cuts to flashbacks about the woman the pitcher has loved so much through the years that , uh , he never married her ? See FOR LOVE OF THE GAME on free or cable TV , where Costner , supporting actor John C. Reilly and the exciting baseball sequences ( the director is Sam Raimi of EVIL DEAD fame ) make it worth a look .	-1
How can someone even mention the brilliant 'Field of Dreams ' together with this overlong , over-sentimental movie ? This is the biggest waste of talent that I 've encountered in quite a while - Sam Raimi , Basil Poledouris , those two are among the best in their professions . And what did they do ? Well , let me put it this way : They took a popular sport , took every energy out of it ( the Baseball-scenes are repeated endlessly , same style , again and again ) , added some of the worst dialogue ever and put a romance at the center of the story . That ai n't so bad , but there 's no chemistry between Costner and Wright-Penn . I could go on , but you get the point . At the end , you 're happy it 's over . No climax , just a needless 'happy end ' . Sam Raimi used to be such a good director , and even in his lesser movies , he had his style . There 's no style here . A flop , financially and critically , Sam Raimi move on ... and give us a good 'Spiderman ' .	-1
One of the few musicals that I regret spending the money on because of the absymal recording quality . The narrator was fairly easy to understand , but some sound track key singers were almost inaudible.The tunes would have been most enjoyable if the technical quality was acceptable.As one who enjoys musicals and muscial shows , I was very disappointed in the recording quality and video quality .	-1
Hmmm ... .how to sum up & quot ; Joseph And The Not-So-Amazing Technicolor Screamcoat ? & quot ; Well , it stars Donny Osmond , Joan Collins , and a bunch of singing five-year-olds . How much more proof do you need that this is a complete waste of existance ? It starts off with a bunch of screaming little kids running around in an auditorium , presumably at an elementary school . This goes on for about fifteen minutes . Really . This was enough to give me a headache . Then again , considering how the rest of the movie went , I would 've been happier just watching that for the next two hours.Why do I hate it ? Well , for one thing , THERE IS NOT ONE SPOKEN LINE IN THE WHOLE THING ! EVERYTHING - YES , EVERYTHING - IS SUNG ! ! ! Yes , I know this is a & quot ; musical & quot ; - but even & quot ; Grease & quot ; has regular spoken dialogue . Also , the makeup and acting - it could not possibly be the least bit cornier . The whole production looks like the kind of dream you 'd have after eating some old enchiladas you found in the back of your fridge . What an insult to everyone and everything.Do I really need to continue going on about how bad this movie is ? I think not . Just do n't watch it , and you wo n't need to run to your local drug store and pick up ten cases of Advil.Snoochie Boochie Noochies !	-1
this is a review of the BLUE RAY DISK -We got the DVD in 2000 and 13 years later we get this CRAP ? WAKE UP PEOPLE.This is NOT Blue Ray quality . I did a side by side comparison.The video quality is very slightly or equal to the DVD quality from the 2000 year release.MAJOR RIP OFF , THIS MUSICAL IS NOT THAT OLD . GO BACK AND LOOK AT OVER THE RAINBOW . ARE YOU TELLING ME THE SOURCE MATERIAL FOR JOSEPH WAS WORSE THAN A MOVE FROM 1939 ? WTF ?	-1
I love the movies . And I can pretty much suspend my disbelief for anything . But when a poorly scripted movie like THE BONE COLLECTOR tells me that a female cop walking the beat is going to be pulled from her position -- because she took some pictures of a crime scene with a disposable camera which are supposed to be phenomenal shots -- and made an instant crime scene investigator ... COME ON ! Top that off with the fact that Lincoln Rhymes keeps making her go into these blackened areas where a killer may or may not be without any backup ... . And top it all off when he tells her he does n't want forensics to mess up the crime scene and he needs the handcuffs that are on the dead victim , & quot ; I need those cuffs . Saw off her hands. & quot ; WHAT ? ! ? That my friends is messing up the crime scene . Since when is a beat cop better at that job than professionals who have trained for years at it ? What a waste of talented actors.If you want to see the BEST serial killer movie , rent SE7EN .	-1
My only reason for wanting to see this film is because Luis Guzman is in it . And if you are a Luis Guzman fan like I am , you will really like the role he plays in this film . He plays a delightful , nice guy , & quot ; Eddie & quot ; , with a New York accent . It was good to see Luis Guzman in a & quot ; good & quot ; role .	-1
how many times do we have to see serial killers , period , let alone serial killers who employ insanely Byzantine methods to kill their hapless victims ? I mean , STEAMING someone to death ? Sheesh ! What happened to good old-fashioned stabbing , followed by snacking , or something ? ( Er , I 'm being facetious . ) A bright spot : Mr. Denzel Washington . In this ho-hum little thriller , he gives what may be one of the best performances of his career . No easy task , when you 're refrained from dipping into the usual actor 's bag of tricks . He conveys a great deal by merely speaking . Impressive work . Ms. Jolie , on the other hand , is far too emotional . How did this cop , as portrayed by Ms. Jolie , get through training ? If you care : the potentially great idea of a bed-confined detective solving murders is ruined by ( as I said ) a ridiculously clever madman ( he even leaves clues -- ho-hum ) who , NATURALLY , has a personal score to settle with the detective . One cliche after another . But a fine performance by Denzel .	-1
What a shame . Totally unrealistic and what a horrendous ending . Washington should have known better .	-1
The Bone Collector is the latest in the overdone , tired , cliched serial killer genre . We only see the killer in dark dank places , we only see him with a mask over his face . Angelina Jolie is cast against type as a woman cop , but unfortunately even that is now becoming a cliche in an overdone attempt at something different . This is strictly formula , been done a thousand times , with flat direction and an utterely boring script . This movie will not be remember as anything great , or even good .	-1
A rookie cop teams up with a legendary ( and paralyzed ) detective to solve a Saw-meets-Se7en serial killer.This film is bad on almost every level . The worst part is the plot , which even if you turn your brain off still produces a bunch of `` huh ? you 're kidding ... '' moments . No joke : documenting the plot holes , deux ex machina contrivance , and just plain inanity of it all would be a Unabomber-length manifesto . Moving past that , however , the performances are wooden enough to make a thousand toothpicks , and the cinematography tries to go for `` dark and creepy '' but just manages to make things to dim to see.I came close to giving this turkey one star , but could n't quite bring myself to do it . There are worse things out there , but there is so much better , too .	-1
With star billings like Denzel Washington & amp ; Angeline Jollie , & amp ; the director , Philip Noyce , I would expect a great suspense thriller but what I got instead is a very average Hollywood formula serial killer movie . The serial killer goes through the motion of killing people whilst leaving clues for Denzel Washington to solve , only to be hinted in the end that the serial killer has got a point to make ( as if the audience could n't figure that out for themselves ) . There 's no tension interplay as I would expect in such type of movie , as depicted magnificently between Anthony Hopkin & amp ; Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs , or even Kevin Spacey & amp ; Brad Pitt & amp ; Morgan Freeman in Seven . Undoubtedly , Denzel Washington 's presence helped to carry this movie to certain extent . On the hindsight , it also leaves us viewers with an after taste about relationships built up between Denzel & amp ; Angeline 's characters which is not been explored concisely . It 's like the director has the intention to carry the intention through but after finding that there 's only a 20 minutes remained , he tries to squeeze all the plots in that much restrained 20 minutes . In other words , the movie overall could have been made tighter & amp ; flowed fluidly .	-1
This movie is such a complete joke . It must have been written by a 15 yr. old . I love to watch Denzel Washington in most of his movies ... but NOT THIS ONE . I can not believe he agreed to sign on to this mess . I am almost at a loss for words to describe how bad this movie is to watch . DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE .	-1
Okay , this movie is heavy on atmosphere , which everyone seems to notice and comment on . But as the movie 's most salient characteristic , it is n't enough to carry it . I found the characters wooden and predictable , and the story even more predictable.The backstory -- which we 're shown in flashbacks -- is fairly standard : forbidden childhood love between a white guy and Japanese girl , which the girl abruptly declares is impossible and walks away from . Hawke 's character is supposed to be bitter , but he does n't seem particularly embittered -- remorseful , yes , but not bitter.And there is also the I-can't-fill-my-father's-shoes element . Yawn.Or course , everyone does the right thing in the end and Hawke 's character 's bitterness is resolved with all the banality and predictability you 'd expect . With all the talent in this movie , you wonder why everyone is so dull ... dull , dull , dull . The only engaging character in the film is Max Von Sydow , who I guess can do no wrong . Has he ever ? I do n't think so.Rent this one on dollar night . Definitely do n't buy it .	-1
It 's not a bad film and is to be commended for powerfully capturing the forcing of Americans of Japanese descent into crudely made , wooden shacks in the middle of deserts or dry lake beds.But the most interesting characters are mere objects/plot devices to push the story along . They are n't allowed to tell their own stories . We solely see them through the eyes of the white characters.The father , played by Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa and his son , played by Rick Yune , have an interesting story to be told -- the father who teaches his son to be strong , silent and have resolve , who is then interned into America 's concentration camps , and the son , a WWII veteran , comes back to claim his father 's land which was sold off while they were gone . Unfortunately , you do n't hear it in this movie . ... This movie is basically about a sometimes whiny man who ca n't live up to his father 's legacy as a lawyer , and like an immature person , would rather hold a grudge than do what is right , that is , until the end .	-1
Snow falling on ceders has all the warmth and cheer of the wet , dismal , cold and foggy weather of the region . Utterly depressing.The plot is plodding and stale . No surprises.None of the characters can one identify or sympathise with . That every group is bigoted is nothing new.The ending not worth waiting for.Scenery is lovely as usual but the only redeeming feature of this film is that it portrays the region as it was that began dying out as I was born . The lumber industry and fishing are no longer what they once were . The ferry boats and strawberry fields are still there but tourism is now the biggy .	-1
Well , the word cheesy comes to mind . I expected more from the main characters . The plot is neither exciting or dull , but somewhere in between . All of the actors have turned in better performances and that they are in this movie is the only reason I watched it . This movie is a ho-hum combo of Star Trek and Star Wars with tidbits of other sci-fi movies of the past .	-1
Yes why ? ! What was Jim Carrey thinking ... ? It 's a very stupid movie . I wish I never watched it . It 's not funny at all . It 's so boring . The only reason why I watched it was because my older sister thought I wanted it when what I actually wanted was the one with Reese Witherspoon . It 's now in my trash .	-1
Oh man , where to start , ok how about this movie is too long . I felt like I was sitting through a six part mini series only I was n't interested at all . Do n't get me wrong , Andy Kaufman was a true innovator and comic genius , but anyone who understood him would know that he must be turning over in his grave knowing that a big budget hollywood bio-pic had been made about him . This movie stands in contrast to everything that Kaufman stood for mayhem , mischief , and improv . Jim Carrey does an admirable job but this movie is a mess . Taxi is just breezed over as are his relationships with the Taxi cast members . Courtney Love is a complete waste of space , her character has no bearing or use in the realm of the story . Pig vomit is pretty good as Bob Zmuda but he ca n't save this train wreck . Do your self a favor and watch the E ! True Hollywood Story on Andy its shorter and much better .	-1
This movie fails on all counts . Why ? 1 ) Jim Carrey is not convincing is Kaufman . Carrey is tall and lanky . Kaufman was short and shlubby . Also , throughout the movie , Carrey gives this weird , letcherous leer that I suppose means that he is pulling a fiendish prank on us , the audience . It 's more of a distraction than anything else.2 ) Danny DeVito plays his manager , yet there are scenes of Kaufman on the set of Taxi with the origional players . How strange is that ? 3 ) Not unlike the the Belushi bio-pic , Wired , the only way to appreciate Kaufman 's comedy bits is to watch the origionals on vhs . Any immitations , even with Carrey , are by definition second-rate.4 ) Dare I say it : Kaufman was n't that great ! His stunts and hijinks were more the result of his LACK of talent . His routines reflect his inability to ENTERTAIN the audience , instead of irritating them . The pseudo-intellectualising of Kaufman after his death is the REALLY laughable thing .	-1
I do not really know what to think about this movie . Jim Carrey is a good performer , in his own way . However a strange sense of humor pervades you as the story unfolds . What do you make of jokes like : `` Why did the siamese twins go to England ? So that the other one could drive ! '' . How about giving a phone call to the Kaufman and Margulies Center for Sexual Research ? ? How about the way this singer appears and performs ? ? I know this is really tough , but I would n't say that this movie is entertaining at all . It seems to be spreading negative ideas ; it 's disturbing ; I felt uneasy after watching it ; not a morale booster ! !	-1
This film should have been a laughfest given Jacqueline Susann 's campy lifestyle and wild excess but things just do n't go well here . Part of the problem is a story which ca n't decide whether to be funny or serious . You feel badly for Susann and her husband Irving Mansfield after their son Guy has to be institutionalized but that sympathy evaporates when they visit the hapless child only to perform their schtick in front of him . Bette Midler is padded and overly made-up to look like a fat yenta but she veers toward self-parody . Nathan Lane is way too effete for his role as Irving Mansfield but Stockard Channing ( who should have played Susann ) and David Hyde Pierce are spot-on .	-1
Hey sorry everyone . I have to rate this movie poorly because thats what it is , a poorly made movie . The acting is predictable , the gags tired , and the humor is so obvious , that you 'd have to be commotose not to get it . It 's not to say obvious humor is bad , it 's just delivered in such poor taste that you begin to wonder why you are watching this . Oh great , we catch him jerking off , ... And the pie scene is probably the most overrated comic scene in this history of cinema . Thats something I do n't really want to see , a guy humping a pie . For all the great movies out their with all the great actors , this movie get a lot of credit in the popularity department because a guy humps a ... pie.Most intellegent people who watch this film realize that it 's bad , but thats not the only reason this movie [ stinks ] . It 's also destructive . It inspired a lot of other [ stuff ] out their now , like 40 Days and 40 Nights . Why oh why lord do movie studios feel that we are so [ stupid ] that we will simply pay [ good money ] to go watch movie about a guys phallis . I know this is the bible to most high school and college students , but let me say as a college student , I hate this movie . So if you are planning to watch this movie , do n't ... Hey , it gets two stars for a few cheap laughs , but thats not saying a lot .	-1
I like to see films that are shocking , insightful , new , genuinly funny or beautiful . This film is neither . I have seen both the R-rated version and the Unrated version ( the fact that the latter was rated NC-17 is further proof of the MPAA 's ineptitude ) and both are tiresome . This being Hollywood , even the & quot ; nerds & quot ; are & quot ; hot & quot ; . There are no imperfect people in this world . The film tries be offensive and gross you out ; and then at the end the producers try add some morality into the film . If your going to make a film about bad-taste - have the balls to go all the way . If you are looking for gross-out comedy , try picking up a film by John Waters or Peter Jackson .	-1
Four high school seniors make a pact to lose their virignity before college.This is the premise for & quot ; American Pie , & quot ; a phenominally successful comedy that 's long on raunch and short on laughs. & quot ; American Pie & quot ; has its moments , though . The scene in which Jason Biggs attempts to make love to an apple pie is hilarious ; the cheesy & quot ; Arabian & quot ; rock band performing & quot ; Midnight At The Oasis & quot ; at the prom is sensational and what normal male between the ages of 12 and 75 could complain about Shannon Elizabeth 's bedroom scene ? This new & quot ; ulitimate edition & quot ; DVD is a bit of a sham , since there 's little difference between the 'unrated ' version and the print released commercially and the special features ( deleted scenes , outtakes , commentaries ) are by no means worthy of TWO discs ! Essentially , & quot ; American Pie & quot ; is a touch of soft corn porn masquerading as a teen comedy and as Paul Mc Cartney once sang : & quot ; what 's wrong with that ? & quot ;	-1
I was advised by a friend who is in my age group ( early 30s ) that this is one of the funniest movies ever made . It is n't . I gave it as much of a chance that I could , but once it got to the scene where Nadia the exchange student is undressing on the webcam and pleasuring herself on that dude 's bed my suspension of disbelief just could n't hold out any longer and I shut it off.Look , you can have gross-out scenes and sophomoric sight gags in a comedy all you want so long as you balance it with some smarts in the script-writing . Too much barf and not enough bite . Pass .	-1
Honestly could have been such a better movie without all of the stupid nudity and sex ! Had a couple of cute spots and that was it !	-1
potty brained swill . Perhaps I am being too kind . OK , I rate it two stars because I actually laughed a few times . But it 's not funny , it 's really sad . Predictable , gratuitous pubescent trash . But I am wasting my typing because it 's obviously the level of much of the American pubic . . er . .public .	-1
This teen film makes the obligatory reference to Shakespeare -- this time to Henry the Fourth , Part One , in a class discussion led by an Asian-American teacher . ( Theere 's a battle over Shakespeare in Porky 's 2 . For other references , see Never Been Kissed , Jawbreaker , The Rage : Carrie 2 , and 10 things I Hate About You . ) Unlike Risky Business , this film does not offer anything by way of an interesting account of boy teen angst over getting laid for the first time . Another overhyped disappointment . If you really want something sexually explicit ( this film is n't ) , go rent a porn .	-1
This film is not funny . It is very poorly scripted . On stepping into the cinema , I was hoping for an evening 's mindless entertainment : and while what I witnessed was sufficiently mindless , it failed to qualify as entertainment . Do yourself a favour and spend your hard earned money on a real life apple pie - and eat it - you 'll be much more satisfied .	-1
I was thorougly dissapointed with this sad excuse for a film . Iam a huge fan of the very talented Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts , whythey choose to do this sickeningly sweet and eerily UNFUNNY picture mystifies me . The plot is thorougly farmiliar . The main flaw is that the Julia Roberts character is THOROUGLY unlikeable ! The film drags and drags . There is even a chase scene which rips off Nine Months . Go for classic Hugh instead .	-1
I expected a lot more from this movie , and as with many other movies , I might do well to watch it a second time to fully appreciate it . It might change my opinion dramatically . For now , though , I can say that the excellent cast and the hype I had heard excited me to the point that this film turned out to be quite disappointing for me . Generally I love all the actors featured here , so I hoped for something a bit more ... compelling.How about I watch it again and make another assessment ?	-1
The best thing I can say about & quot ; Mystery Men & quot ; is that I did not injure myself getting it out of my DVD player . It has good direction and set design , and decent performances , but far , far too few funny bits to support it 's running time . Perhaps if you watch the movie in 30 minute segments it wo n't be so bad but if you do it all in one sitting you will be bored . There are definitely some entertaining parts but they are buried under lots of dull set-up . A good movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon where there is not so much pressure to get all of one 's entertainment from & quot ; Mystery Men & quot ; alone .	-1
I think this is one of the most underrated comedies . It 's very funny , but the HD fizzles big time . This version is exactly like the DVD . No vivid colors , no pop , just blah . Get the DVD version . Do not buy this HD DVD !	-1
Every felt really disappointed . I mean here we have Eddie Murphy & amp ; Steve Martin together , the subject is Hollywood itself with plenty of material for the satarical . An yet I have the impression this movie never really got out of second gear.It is unforunate in the extreme that we 've all seen the performances from Murphy and Martin before . Murphy plays with his usual high energy , a high profile movie actor and his younger goofier brother . But I 've Seen it before . Eddie better films were his breaktrough movie because then it was new and original , now we 've seen him do his & quot ; routine & quot ; a thousand times and it no longer has the same effect . ( Jim Carrey was moving in that direction but The Truman Show seems to offer hopw ) Steve Martin has genuine talent but once again we 've seen him play this character before and again we need a change from Martin as well . Again at the moment his greatest moments lie in the past.The Movie - Just Do n't expect too much , lightly paced with a few laugh here and there . Murphy reaction to all these strange people approching him in the street and seeing Heather Graham sleep her way to the top in 3 days are the highlights . It 's a one watch and then sit in your collection gathering dust movie rather than a movie you 'll come back for more .	-1
Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Arnie and own most of his movies . Okay , Arnold is not the greatest actor to ever grace the screen , but he usually makes great , suspend-disbelief-and-they-are-entertaining movies . Gabriel Byrne is a great actor and usually appears in good movies . Kevin Pollack plays a side-kick as well as anyone and is good comic relief . Between the three of them , you would have hoped that one of them would have read this script and said , & quot ; Oh My God , this story is REALLY BAD ! & quot ; The plot of this movie is predictable and so full of logical holes that it makes one wonder if anyone actually wrote it or if they just started filming a bunch of & quot ; cool & quot ; action and occult scenes and thought putting it all together would make a good movie . The Devil is alternately brilliant and stupid . Arnold somehow manages to outsmart the Prince of Darkness and the New York Police Department , despite being an alcoholic burn-out . And , after watching this movie I am still confused as to who Arnold and Kevin actually work for . As for the number of the beast being 999 instead of 666 and that being why Satan has to mate in 1999 , I am still confused as to what happened in the year 999 . Would n't that have been the end of the thousand years they kept babling about in this movie ? Did the Devil run into an ancient version of Arnold and get his butt kicked then , too ? And if so , why did n't he learn ? In addition to the cast already mentioned , this movie also has other good actors who should have known better . Robin Tunney ( great in & quot ; The Craft & quot ; ) , Rod Stieger ( & quot ; On the Waterfront & quot ; ) , Anthony Fultz ( & quot ; For Love of the Game & quot ; ) and CCH Pounder ( & quot ; Face Off & quot ; ) are all wasted in this suprisingly bad movie.Do n't get me wrong . I can suspend disbelief with the best of them , and I know movies are supposed to be entertainment and not reality . But , at some level , the movie must make sense and fill in the blanks . This movie seems to be just a vehicle for Arnold to kick Satan 's ass . That is not a good enough reason to see this film.If you are a true Arnie fan , you will see this anyway , despite the flaws ( I did ) . But , it is not up to his usual quality , and is best rented first , before bought . Caveat emptor .	-1
This film can be clumped with all the other apocalyptic dramas that came as a direct result of millenial anticipation . This is one of those movies that makes you wonder if Hollywood is cutting back on production costs by hitting up local LA elementary schools for the best writers in the fifth grade classes . The least they could do is hire kids from a good school system.The associations in the film are extraordinarily weak and lack any sort of logical backing , which is actually rather typical of writers who are barely out of the sensorimotor stage . Hopefully those who wrote this & quot ; film & quot ; have at least successfully navigated the travails of object permanence.One prominent example of this ill logic being that Satan is invulnerable to any eartly implement . . . except for a Arnold and his bazooka . That tidbit of knowledge will come in handy during the actual apocalypse . The Four Horseman will be helpless . Oh , and let us not forget the premise : That medieval Catholic priests ( in Rome ) foretold that Satan would come to earth to impregnate his chosen bride on December 31 , 1999 at midnight ( Eastern Standard Time mind you ) thus signaling the coming of the antichrist . Now , as anyone over the age of 10 can see , how could a priest in medieval Rome predict that Satan would go to a continent that had n't been discovered ( N. America ) , to a city that had n't been founded ( New York City ) , at a time that would translate to 5am Rome time . The list of script ridiculousness goes on and on . In short , I have n't seen dog this big since Clifford . This movie is terrible . This movie was so bad that even extensive nudity could n't have salvaged it . There are not many movies that one can say that about.As a general rule of thumb , the more Arnold speaks during movies , the worse it is . Example : Terminator 1 and 2 - Good . Jingle All the Way - Bad . On a related note , avoid all movies with Sinbad in them as well.I recommend that you the movie-going public avoid this movie at all costs and if you really want to see a good movie in the & quot ; coming of the antichrist & quot ; mold , I highly recommend The Devil 's Advocate and The Omen .	-1
Remember Last Action Hero ? Well , this one is better , but that does not say much . Most action films have poor acting and this one is no exception , in fact , this one has worse acting than the usual . Not to mention , the lamest wisecracks this side of Adam Sandler . Do n't get me wrong , there were a few good scenes . Unfortunately , it does not save the film from being just a special effects nightmare . GRADE : C-	-1
The gist of this movie is the battle between good and evil , and the weapon for that battle is faith . Does that sound like a Schwarzenegger film to you ? Explosions and fight scenes abound in this millennial battle for the fate of the world as we know it.The year is 1999 , and Jericho , played by Schwarzenegger , is a former New York policeman who is living on the edge . To illustrate this , our first scene is with him , contemplating suicide . If you have ever seen Mel Gibson 's performance in `` Lethal Weapon , '' then you have seen this part . His personal struggle continues as a question of his faith because of the death of his family.Now that the millennium is coming to a close , the Prince of Darkness has returned to Earth to claim a bride . If he mates with this bride before the new millenium , then the world will end . Jericho gets caught up in the battle to stop him , but learns that his weapons only take him so far.This is not a great movie . Gabriel Byrne plays the Prince of Darkness very well , but the viewer may find him or herself questioning his powers . He can change reality , but he ca n't seem to stop Jericho . He can walk through fire unscathed , but he ca n't keep from getting shot . The movie did n't seem well thought out.I would recommend giving this film a miss .	-1
He said he would be back.Arnold is back , and this time he is not battling other Terminators , but instead Satan himself . Who wins ? Who do you think ? End of Days is another film in the long line of supernatural films of which I think we all have just about had our fill . Arnold plays Jericho Cain who must protect a woman from being impregnated by Satan . Exciting , huh ? Well , the real problem here is you will be bored through most of the movie . Sure , there are some nice action sequences , but none that will stick with after you have left the theatre ( nothing as ground breaking as we saw in The Matrix ) . The characters are dull all except for Kevin Polluck 's character who does have some good one liners.The real problem with this film is that you will get the & quot ; been here , done that & quot ; before feeling all the way through . I sure did . There was nothing original in this film to keep my interest . Plus , the film is long and drawn out . I go to an Arnold film to a ) see him make a fool of himself ( a la Kindergarten Cop ) or b ) see him kill a lot of people . He does neither here.As you can tell , I was just not really impressed with this film at all . Maybe worth a rental where you can talk during half of it while you are waiting for the next action sequence . Otherwise , save your money .	-1
This movie will find a core of obsessed fans who think it 's the greatest thing they 've ever seen , and will watch it eight hundred times a year . ( Kind of like the original Star Trek . ) Pretty soon we 'll have End of Days conventions with Schwarzenegger running around wearing Spock ears.It 's actually a kind of valid comparison . What do non-fans know about the original Star Trek series ? Bad plots ( when there was a plot at all ) , pretty cheesy script , a whole lot of special effects , some decent acting , and James T. Kirk going to bed with every alien who kinda halfway looked female in the universe . Aside from that last point ( Gabriel Byrne only gets to bed two people , neither of whom is an alien ... but it 's a pretty remarkable scene anyway ) , End of Days could well have been a Star Trek movie . The acting is better , the special effects are fantastic , and any chance to see Robin Tunney unclothed should be seized by the masses immediately . But man , ... the script seems as if it were written by a somnambulistic quaalude addict , the plot is ... absent , and the whole thing feels like a rush job designed to cash in both on Y2K and the current rash of religious-themed movies that teens are enjoying . Did you see Stigmata ? Did you see Strange Days ? If you can answer yes to both , you can skip this without a problem . The one truly awe-inspiring thing about this movie is its acting . Schwarzenegger is getting kind of old as the same guy over and over again , but Kevin Pollak is just fantastic , and Gabriel Byrne is ... well , Gabriel Byrne . Both had their share of snappy ( probably ad-libbed , given how bad the rest of the script is ) lines that kept the audience laughing.A word on the much-hyped soundtrack to the movie . It 's good -- at least it 's above average . But aside from one track , played VERY softly ( the Rob Zombie tune , which is in evidence when Gabe is walking across what I assume is Central Park ) , it does n't exist in the movie . The movie 's music is good , but it is n't what 's on the soundtrack . ( Orchestral , standard , but fits what 's going on very well and never gets overbearing . ) For Schwarzenegger/Byrne/Tunney/Pollak completists . Everyone else can skip it and catch Toy Story 2 .	-1
Boring , annoying , downright insulting . Miss it .	-1
Okay , I am not going to totally diss this movie . But personally , I hate movies with Arnoald what 's a netor , or what ... For the story line , and the very very neat graphics this was a let down . It was a little slow , and you had to dig to understand the stuff , and it 's all church , stuff and things , and it was really kind of bad . For me , I did n't like it at all , But for other 's they probally would n't mind . But if someone asked , I 'd say ... No , and that 's what it 's going to stay at .	-1
Buyer beware ! Amazon just shipped our replacement copy of this entire set , and the 2D Blu-ray of Creature From the Black Lagoon is STILL DEFECTIVE.The defect affects both picture and sound at around 59 minutes in . From there on the disc skips and glitches for several minutes . We have two high-end set-ups and neither one of our players , one Sony , one Samsung , play this disc properly . Now that we have received a total of TWO copies of the entire set ( thanks , Amazon , for the prompt replacement ) we KNOW it is a result of Universal 's legendary lack of Quality Control.Otherwise it 's a wonderful if pricey set . But do n't waste your hard-earned money on this until Universal acknowledges this defective disc and promises that they have fixed this disc . ( I can not say if any of the other discs are defective , as we have n't even had a chance to screen them all . )	-1
This is n't a real review of the titles but I could n't resist giving my two cents . I received an email from Universal on the release of Universal Classic Monsters on blu-ray . I was thinking $ 30-40 for the set and was floored when I saw them at $ 144 . I wo n't be buying them but if you do , I hope they look very very good . $ 144 , man ... ...	-1
Viewed : 6/06Rate : 16/06 : Before I will begin commenting vehemently against the 1998 's Psycho , one burning question comes to my mind like nothing else : WHY ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ! ? ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? WHY ! WHY ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? WHY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! To answer such a great question like that , I fail to see any conclusive evidence . Ok , that was one of the few worst films I 've ever watched in my whole life . The picture was made shot for shot except for the masturbation incident , which was like ... a complete desecration of the great original classic . How could the conceivable idea of remaking Psycho exist ? How could that be possible ? How in the world could that be allowed ? Everybody who made Psycho is forever shamed . Every one of them : Vince Vaughn , Anne Heche , William Macy , Julianne Moore , Robert Forster , Gus Van Sant , ... ..all of them . I ca n't image how Alfred Hitchcock must be feeling if he actually had the chance to see it . Anthony Perkins exercised one of the most natural acting imbued into an unforgettable character that remains to be one of the most enduring icons in cinema history . To think of Vince Vaughn trying to emulate the feat that Anthony Perkins adeptly created is to feel complete hatred and loathing with strong enmity towards to the remade picture grouping a team of disrespectful unprofessionals . It 's like as if they referred Psycho as `` oh yeah ... a classic ... all the way through , man.. '' and then proceeded to unzip their pants and piss on it . All in all , 1998 's Psycho is one of the worst pictures with the worst acting imaginable and the worst respect imaginable .	-1
Why ? Why ? WHY ? Why remake a classic horror film ? That means remaking it with exactly the same screenshots , lines , right down to the same camara angles used in the original . The only difference is that this one 's in color . So if they 're basicly the same then this will be just as good , right ? Wrong ! I do n't know exactly what it is , but the remake just does n't have any of the style and flair of the first.I was bored while I watched this movie ( because I watched it before the original . ) The remake of Psycho actually made it into the top 100 celebrity opps ! I dunno , I guess I 'm not really one for remakes ( but I do like the Fly ( 1986 ) ) esp if it 's a remake of a really good movie . Most remake are , because no one wants to remake a bad movie , even though bad movies are the ones they actually SHOULD be remaking.Do n't buy this movie . Well , I do n't know , if you love it then you can get it . But the 1960 version is way better . The acting was also better . Nothing beats Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates , or Janet Leigh ( mother of Jamie Lee Curtis ) as Marion Crane . Also I think the film just 'works ' better in black and white.I 'm giving the remake two stars because it 's still a great story . But the question still remains-why ?	-1
Gus Van Sant is a talented director in his own right , as he proved in his stirring and depressing account of the travails and adventures of a latter-day Henry V `` My Own Private Idaho . '' So why , then , did Van Sant feel the need to make this version of `` Psycho '' , which is n't even a 'version ' , since this movie is a slavish shot-for-shot remake of the original , albeit set in the 1990's.As I 've said on many an occasion , I have no problem with a true remake : a fresh look on an old theme is perfectly fine , so long as it 's well done and has something new to say . But given Van Sant 's directorial talent , and considering the top tier ( albeit underrated ) acting talent involved ( Vince Vaughn , Anne Heche , William H. Macy , and Viggo Mortensen , it 's hard to fathom why Van Sant would choose to use his talents on something like this.It 's worth emphasizing to the incredulous that this movie is NOT a remake , but is , indeed , a SHOT-for-SHOT reshoot of the original Hitchcock classic . Except for perhaps two little inexplicable touches , the film uses every camera angle , and every snippet of dialogue , and all of the characters , in the original film : the only departure from the original `` Psycho '' is that this movie is shot in color . Of the two departures , there is n't much to say : they take the form of brief 'visions ' edited MTV-style into the killing sequences , and include a roiling stormy sky , a masked woman in a bikini , and an ewe.For this we needed a feature film ? What 's more , while the movie itself is at first intriguing as a curiosity ( `` hmmm ... let 's see how Anne Heche plays the shower sequence ) quickly begins to resemble bad dinner theater , and the film and actors , by definition , draw comparison to the original . Lamentably , they do n't do well in the comparison . Anne Heche is tasty as always as Marion Crane , but she does n't hold a candle to Janet Leigh 's subtle portrayal of a libidinous woman wracked simultaneously by greed and guilt . Viggo Mortensen adds more of a Lil ' Abner sensibility to his role than should be decent.William H. Macy , usually outstanding , is just embarrassing in the role of Detective Arboghast , and Vince Vaughn is completely underwhelming and unbelievable as Norman Bates : watching Vaughn exerting himself on the lines that Anthony Perkins made seem effortless , you begin to realize just how supremely well-suited Perkins was for the role . If anything , watching Van Sant 's reshoot of `` Psycho '' is almost the ultimate homage to Hitchcock 's film , if only that you in doing so you realize what a marvel the original was.Van Sant 's reshoot of `` Psycho '' , then , is interesting for about 15 minutes ; after that you begin wondering what the point is . Put the original `` Psycho '' on the hopper instead ; you 'll be glad you did .	-1
Where was Alfred Hitchcock 's name in the credits ? Was the film dedicated to him and I blinked and missed it ? Was he acknowledged in any way , other than his silly cameo ? How much money was Patricia Hitchcock paid to say , in the featurette , that her father would have approved of this movie ? These and many other questions can be condensed into one word : why ? Remaking this , shot-for-shot and in color , was a huge error in judgement made by whomever it was that green-lighted this cinematic travesty . Whereas , in the original , Anthony Perkins , under the guidence of the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock , played Norman as the somewhat disturbed but likeable boy next door and therefore the ending was a shock , Vince Vaughn played crazy right from the get-go , completely spoiling the rest of the film . Viggo Mortensen 's acting could n't have been worse , and what 's the deal with them changing the house ? The old house was sinister and creepy , especially in black and white ; the new house looks like a reject from a William Castle movie . The opening credits , in color , look very nice , but the film slides quickly downhill from there . This film might have worked if only Anne Heche had played Norman instead of Marion . If you 've never seen either version , please see the original !	-1
I watched this re-make immediately after having seen the original and was very surprised and disappointed to see how EXACTLY alike the two are , and yet how horrible this version was compared to the original . Since I saw them back-to-back , I can point out the annoyances in great detail.1 . The casting is horrible . I hate the new Norman Bates ; he is completely idiotic and unbeliavable . Julianne Moore is about the best this film has to offer and sadly , that is n't much because she is confined to using pretty much the EXACT SAME DIALOGUE almost word-for-word ( I 'm not kidding ) as the original . Anne Heche is good in her role , too , but besides these 2 women , there is n't much here.2 . Because so little was changed from the original , it is completely unbelievable that the movie takes place in the supposed & quot ; 1998 & quot ; - 99 % of the dialogue is exactly the same and some words and phrases that were accepted because the original was made in 1960 are not acceptable here because they told us it takes place in 1998.3 . The acting itself is both robotic to the original and annoying at the same time . Amazing how they were able to pull that off , but with the exact same script , I can see how it happened.In short , this movie is definitely not worth seeing , if you are going to see the Psycho movies , begin with the original one made in 1960 and work your way up . This re-make is a waste of time . Which reminds me , even the run-times of the movies are almost identical ; the same exact scenes happen at or around the same times on the clock counter on your DVD player .	-1
If you 're going to redo Psycho , do n't do it this way ! I mean the movie is a shot-for-shot muddling of the classic ... with an exception of the subliminal messages planted in the death of the detective ( who did n't laugh at the cow ? ) this movie is devoid of any creativity what-so-ever ! Vince Vaughn actually makes Norman Bates seem normal ! Well ... not really , but he is normal compared to Anthony Perkins perfect performance as that wacko . Casting Pee-wee Herman as Norman would have been genius . So anyways ... avoid this and stick with the original .	-1
Talk about a re-make stinker ! ! ... .A total waste of film ! Who in the hell was watching the store when this was being made nothing good at all ... Vince Vaughn could n't make `` Norman Bates '' work at all ! ! who cast him for this role ? The whole thing is beyond a down right bad movie re-make ...	-1
This film has few supporters . It is a shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock 's 1960 masterpiece with a much worse cast and performances . Norman Bates is a motel owner and operator with a mother fixation . A beautiful young woman has stolen some money and plots her escape before turning up at the motel . Gus Van Sant had the option to pick any film in the studio catalog to remake and he chose this . Even more surprisingly he filmed it to look identical to the original in every way ( except adding animals , comedic performances and masturbation ) . Despite being based on a true story that provided many more details in recent years than anyone had access to in 1960 , Van Sant refuses to update the material in his homage to Hitchcock ( who might have said , `` you mean fromage '' ) .The most obvious problem was Vince Vaughn could not hold a candle to Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates . Vaughn 's giggling and leering provide nothing to audiences . None of the other star-studded cast members ( Heche , Mortensen , Macy ) seem to take the project seriously either . Every single one of them is better than this . James Le Gros was the best by far and he is only in one scene . They are all having way too much fun for a horror-thriller . Psycho managed to make $ 21.5 million . Unfortunately , the budget was $ 60 million making it a very large flop . Did anyone ask what business they had with a $ 60 million budget for what should have been a very easy to film production with modern technology ? Looks like the stars laughed all the way to the bank . Psycho did not return until the loosely related TV series over a decade later ( Bates Motel ) . I wonder if this movie will ever get a Blu-ray . Read the production notes on the back cover and you will be amazed.As a huge fan of Psycho , Perkins , Hitchcock and the Robert Bloch book I was expecting a real treat . `` This is going to be amazing , '' I assured my friends as we all bought tickets . Just about everyone was confused or laughing all the way through the movie . This was a horror that shocked audiences in 1960 . Now it 's a comedy . Characters exiting out of passenger doors ( needs to be updated for modern audiences ) , Viggo in a cowboy hat , weird inserts during the detective murder , Macy laughing like Pee Wee Herman as he is murdered , Vince masturbating , and worst of all was when Mother was revealed at the end because everyone howled with laughter . The pacing of everything seems off because it 's a shot-for-shot remake not a note-for-note remake so the dialogue , sound and delivery do n't come together . They even tweaked the original ending . Needless to say it ca n't compare to Hitchcock 's masterpiece and it was incredibly disappointing . No one wanted to see the original after I made them sit through this garbage . Another horror legacy imploded . Watch Psycho I - IV with Anthony Perkins to get the real deal.The Psycho remake is better than the Bates Motel TV Movie ( not TV series ) that does n't even get a listing on Amazon because it was so bad . It is stuck on VHS because it was made to cash in on Psycho and did not feature Anthony Perkins . Bud Cort and Lori Petty star in the off-shoot TV movie . In Bates Motel , Norman Bates is dead and one of his fellow inmates in the asylum inherits the motel . The production values are possibly the worst I have ever seen on television or theatrically . The lead actor speaks straight into the camera at times . It 's shockingly bad even for a horror sequel . It almost looks like `` Return to Salem 's Lot '' it is so bland . So perhaps the remake will live again despite getting 2.5 stars from Amazon reviewers ( ouch ! ) .	-1
Watch Gus direct a shot-for-shot remake of one of the greatest shockers of all time ... Watch Gus bring nothing new into the mix ... Watch the cast desperately try to give different line readings to the ( almost ) identical script ... Watch Julianne Moore , William H. Macy & Vince Vaughn blemish their careers ... Marvel at the blinding colour of this farce ... Marvel at the stupidity of all involved ... Pray he does n't try the same thing with THE BIRDS ...	-1
This remake of the cherished 1960 Hitchcock classic is pointless and unnecessary . It 's like remaking Sunset Boulevard ( rest in peace , Billy Wilder ) in color with Raquel Welch and Freddy Prinze , Jr. in the Gloria Swanson and William Holden roles and throwing in a Basic Instinct sex scene for good measure . Psycho is like Casablanca , Laura , It 's a Wonderful Life , Some Like It Hot and To Kill a Mockingbird -- great films where the audience , after seeing them , can never picture other actors playing those roles . For me , Marion Crane will always be Janet Leigh and Norman Bates will always be Anthony Perkins -- period . Hitchcock 's Psycho is a masterpiece that deserves to stand on its own without a shot-for-shot pale imitation to stain its memory . There are many things wrong with this version , but I 'll concentrate on four areas : First , Vince Vaughn has a completely and utterly impossible task of trying to match up to Anthony Perkins ' performance in the original . Perkins ' Norman Bates came out of his own personality . He , like Norman Bates , lost his father at an early age and had a internal conflict over his own sexual identity . He , like Norman Bates , had a clinging , possessive mother . Vaughn , in contrast , is behind the eight ball as soon as he appears on the screen in the remake . Vaughn plays Norman Bates . Perkins IS Norman Bates . Vaughn tries his best , but it is n't nearly enough.The updated touches director Gus Van Sandt has added -- namely the masturbation , vomiting , nudity and the added gore . Instead of making a positive additional contribution to the story , these updates merely seem like a gratuitous tack-on that Van Sandt has added to appeal to modern audiences . Martin Scorcese 's remake of Cape Fear earned the right to deal more graphically with its subject matter than the original . In that case , the added story elements gave that version a depth that the original did not possess . The updates in the remake of Psycho , however , seem like pandering to an audience that Van Sandt fears wo n't accept his version without the modern expected minimum of sex , violence and gore.Van Sandt also makes a concession to modern audiences by filming in color . If there has ever been a film that was destined to be made in black and white , it is Psycho . Whether Hitchcock meant to film the original in black and white for artistic reasons , to save on the budget or merely to spare audiences the gore of the shower scene , the final effect worked beautifully without color . Bernard Herrmann even wrote his brilliant score exclusively for strings , striving for a `` black and white sound . '' A perfect example is the scene where Detective Milton Arbogast ( Martin Balsam in the original , William H. Macy in the remake ) sneaks up to the Bates house . In the original , even though it is still daylight , there is a sense of foreboding due to the black and white photography . The shadows are darker and the house looks even more menacing . Macy 's climb up to the house , in contrast , seems too colorful and too bright . There 's no menace or foreboding to the scene at all . Anyone who finds black and white films unwatchable might change their tune if they see both versions of Psycho.However , for me , the biggest weakness of the remake of Psycho is Anne Heche 's performance . Heche is a good actress , but here she makes all of the wrong choices . Marion Crane , as played by Janet Leigh , is a person who has followed the rules all of her life -- a `` good girl '' who has worked hard and has a good head on her shoulders . We identified with Janet Leigh 's Marion because we saw a lot of ourselves in her . When Marion steals the $ 40,000 in the original , we root for her because Leigh has done such an effective job of establishing Marion as a good person who sees her life slipping away and is driven to her larceny by her desperation . And when she is gone , we all feel the loss of someone we cared about.Heche , in contrast , has stated that she saw Marion as a flightly , scatterbrained person who has no perception of the consequence of her actions . This approach misses the whole point of the character . In the Hitchcock original , there is a moment of indecision by the audience after Marion 's exit over shifting allegiance to Norman Bates . We have spent the first half of the film becoming involved in the fate of a person we identify with and care about . Now , Hitchcock forces us to identify with the person who is covering up her demise . Because of Heche 's approach to the role , Marion becomes a superficial dingbat who elicits no sympathy while she is alive and who the audience does not miss when she is dead . The whole point of the story is that Marion IS a good person who `` just goes a little mad '' when she steals the $ 40,000 . She is n't , as Heche suggests in her interpretation , an irresponsible person who does n't realize the consequences of her actions . Heche 's approach blunts all of the dramatic impact of the story and irrepably hurts the film 's effectiveness.Aside from a performance by Julianne Moore that improves upon the shrill performance of Vera Miles in the original and a performance by William H. Macy that equals that of Martin Balsam , this film has nothing new or positive to offer . Gus Van Sandt is a talented filmmaker who hopefully will avoid projects like this in the future . He should concentrate on establishing his own legacy rather than trying to copy the legacy of Alfred Hitchcock . If he goes up against The Master of Suspense , he 's going to lose badly .	-1
One of the worst ideas ever . Why remake something that is perfect ? Gus Van Sant , you will never be Hitchcock . Your movies will be forgotten , especially this rubbish , ten years from now , as the Master 's will be remembered forever . If you 're going to do a remake exactly , do n't add your own creations such as the woman and the clouds . They make 0 sense and you should not be allowed to ever make a movie ever again . If anyone has not seen the original , do so . AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS .	-1
I saw this film in the theater , and again on video . I did n't like it both times . Despite a great cast ( including one of my favorites , William H. Macy ) and a great director , I think that this film tries too hard to recreate something that clearly just was not meant to be recreated . If you want a real thrill , rent the original . This one takes to many liberties with the meanings behind some of Hitchcock 's original ideas .	-1
I do own this remake of PSYCHO and its not nearly as good as it could have been . A visual pleasure without a doubt but , the story lacks because of the acting . These are all good actors but not in this film , seems to me the actors figured it was going to be a Hit , well maybe if they had tried a little harder with there roles it might have been . Remaking a movie shot for shot can be a bad idea and is in this case . No story changes , caused every momment to be predicted .	-1
In other words , a lifeless corpse of a movie.This movie is exactly like the original , the only differences being that it is not scary , interesting , engaging , or convincing.The movie equivalent of a Paint by Numbers knockoff of the Mona Lisa.Van Sant 's next projects include remakes of the following : & quot ; Gone With the Wind & quot ; with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks & quot ; Citizen Kane & quot ; starring Tom Cruise with a soundtrack by N'SYNC & quot ; The Grapes of Wrath & quot ; starring Bob Saget , Rosie O'Donnell ( as & quot ; Ma & quot ; ) , and George & quot ; Goober & quot ; Lindsey.Hooray for Hollywood .	-1
& quot ; Hey , why do n't I remake 'Psycho , ' shot for shot , but this time , film it in color ? & quot ; said Homer .	-1
I do n't give this 1 star , I give it no stars.What ... were they think ? Well , nothing.Vince Vaughn holds no candle to Anthony Perkins , Vaughn was totally not the choice for the famous role of Norman Bates , only Perkins did that back in 1960 and still does it know 42 years later.Nowonder it took Gus-Van Snat 4 years to make another movie after this piece of ... .Hitchcock 's version is one of the best movies ever made.Do n't rent the ... remake , rent the classic one instend .	-1
... this movie nor do I plan to after reading about on Wikipedia . Hithcock 's Psycho was perfect and did not need to be remade !	-1
This was quite possibly one of the very worst movies I have ever had to sit through . I actually gave up and stopped watching at around the time Christian Bale , the star , began hacking away at somebody to the beat of a Huey Lewis song , & quot ; Hip To Be Square. & quot ; Mr. Lewis , as I understand it , was n't very pleased over the movie 's use of his music and actually tried taking the filmmakers to court . Ca n't say that I blame him.Although based on a popular novel that I will admit I have n't read , the movie just did n't seem to have any real story . Yet , there were people and critics alike who thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread . Go figure . What I find hard to accept is the fact that Leonardo Dicaprio had long been considered for the role Bale eventually won ! I 'm glad he turned it down because , frankly , a lousy movie like this would have easily ruined his career.Rent & quot ; Henry , Portrait of a Serial Killer & quot ; if you really want a chilling film experience . It was shot for half the budget of this one and is far superior .	-1
Well here we go with some originality . A & quot ; comedy & quot ; , or is it a satire , about the Eighties . In my opinion it 's merely an excuse for bloodletting and Christian Bale to strip down all the time . I found it 's intellectual content to be shallow , acting to be marginial , and it 's moralistic overtone to be questionable . First of all why does it require death and violence to be a satire on America in the Eighties and second of all since when has multiple homicides been humorous ? Looking over the reviews I 'm not sure what I found to be worse . the fact that so many talk about the laughs that broke out during the murders or the folks who go on and on about the Eighties soundtrack and clothes . Perhaps the real statement about the American way of life should be the lack of reaction that this movies did n't invoke from people . I dare say we are n't so far removed from the Romans as we may think .	-1
This film was like a very bad made-for-cable movie . There was no plot , and when you think you have a chance of figuring out what is going on , the end comes , and you have no idea of what just happened . Christian Bale is normally a good actor , but in this movie he is a really bad over-actor . The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 are the visuals . Aside from the plot and the acting , the film is the definition of surreal . When else are you going to see a nail gun pointed at the back of a woman 's head or a prostitute being chased by a naked guy with a chainsaw . That 's about all the movie is about , folks . If your feel like wasting time and money , rent ( or buy ) it , but I 'd just wait for cable .	-1
I hated this movie . Perhaps I am not bright enough to get the underlying message . I find violence , blood and gore with a rambling , disjointed story line to be pointless and a waste of my time . At least when we watched the Freddie movies after we screamed we secretly laughed because they were n't to be taken seriously .	-1
Watched first 5 minutes ... did not like one thing about it..ca n't imagine this even got any ratings ... wanted to cancel but could n't	-1
I quit watching it ... .It did n't seem well done.. It was meant to be violent , but it was violent just for the sake of being bloody .	-1
Avoid this film if possible ! The only thing I liked was the male nude scenes . It was quite a bad film : (	-1
I bought this film for a good price having heard alot about it and with the word psycho in the title , I just had to see it . The only good thing about this movie is the bloody killing scenes . Other than that , I found this movie boring at times . To call it terrifying is going a bit too far . Even scary is a bit too far . If you like the serial killer type movies , you might like this one but do n't be prepared to be blown away !	-1
I had the misfortune of seeing part of this disturbing film on cable the other night . I saw the part where Christian Bale has two women in his apt . performing sex acts on each other , while he directs their every move and films them and himself . It was totally degrading and gross . I turned it off after watching in disgust for a few minutes . What a misogynistic piece of garbage .	-1
The only reason I saw this movie is because it was on Mystery science theater 3000 . John Agar is a terrible actor and watching this movie is like waiting in the lobby of a dentist office waiting to get your teeth drilled..	-1

After is saw the 2002 version starring Jim Caviezel and Dagmara Domincyzk , which is my favorite movie ever , I was hungry for more . So I headed to my local library , and found this old tape hidden behind the 2002 one . I was overjoiced . The back says 'A swashbuckling tale of injustice and revenge ' . Swashbuckling my eye ! This movie has one swordfight , yes ONE , at the very end . This version is EXTREMELY boring and slow-paced . Be warned , this is not a good action/adventure . It does n't even have a beautiful Mercedes .	-1
As The Count Of Monte Cristo is my favorite movie ever , this version disappointed me greatly . I have read the book and seen the 2002 movie dozens of times and it FAR superior in every aspect to this one . The 1952 version is even better by a wide margin than this one . Chamberlain is terrific , but the events are not accurate to the other versions or to the wonderful book written in the 1850's.Stephen CourtsColumbus , OhioAugust 19,2011	-1

The movie is OK , I suppose , if you read the book and want to now watch some images to go along with that book . And that is the crux of my criticism ; given the dated production , one can only watch this movie and not partake in it.More specifically , compared to today 's productions of Austen , Dickens , etc . from the BBC and elsewhere , this production is rather bland.The lines are delivered as if they were being read , passion is reserved to the level that one wonders if it exists that all . There is no heated exchange , no believable human interaction , the scenes are devoid of the dirt and chaos of reality.In total , compared to today 's productions , there is no `` suspension of disbelief '' .The best I can say about this production is perhaps it would have gotten four stars back in 1980 when he was released.For now , I 'll keep it on a shelf while I live the most recent realistic renditions of Austin , Dickens , and the other classics.Regards ,	-1
I have seen the movie and had a copy on VHS and have seen on tv and wanted a dvd to add to my collection . What is region2 anyway never heard of it and wanted one to play in NJ area or NY area .	-1
This Blu Ray was a huge disappointment . The film is excellent and deserves a better audio transfer . Thinking a Blu Ray would have great sound , I bought the disc . For the price it cost me , I was let down . ( The DVD actually has better audio , although poor picture quality . ) As I have learned , one really should do extensive homework before purchasing Blu Rays . Many of these old films are cheaply put together for BR . Some old films fare better on DVD . The picture is fantastic , but , again , the audio is terrible . And , there are none of the regular features , such as a menu ; and certainly not any special features to speak of , not even a trailer . Lions Gate needs to release a suitable Blu Ray of this quality film .	-1
Well , as usual , the sequel is a far cry from the original . I thought The Arrival was one of the better sci-fi movies out there ... and then I rented and saw this . One of the great things about this genre of film is the mystery that is involved in finding and detecting aliens from the main characters . This was lacking in this film . In the first one , we saw so much tension before Charlie Sheen 's discovery of other life forms.This movie , on the other hand , totally disregards this and turns this in an & quot ; action & quot ; movie filled with the following : a stupid subplot of Zane 's ( main character from first movie ) brother being this total slacker computer guy who hates then loves a reporter , too much focus on the main characters running from aliens and aliens ( looking like humans ) driving cars and barking out orders to other aliens , a plot that seems to be nonexistent ( I never figured out what the Zane 's brother really was supposed to be doing in the movie , except being cool ) , no real focus on & quot ; aliens & quot ; per se ( as there is only one or two actual alien scenes ) , cheezy one liners and lack of purpose for the characters ( the characters just seem to be going in circles and , as a result , so does the movie ) , no sense of direction.I did like ideas behind this movie , but it seemed like this was just a quick attempt to push another sequel out there and see what happens . I would not recommend unless you are a patient person .	-1
Ok I only have one beef with this DVD , but it 's a HUGE beef . I initially thought the idea of a metal case was a great idea , but after owning this dvd for a day , the actual dvd case is torn up from this metal cover . If you are going to make a metal cover , at least make it a little bigger than the actual case ! ! !	-1
My two stars rating does n't reflect on the movie itself which is outstanding , nor does it pertain to the video and audio quality of this BD transfer which is very good . However , the disc menu is quite another story , starting with a very serious looking intial message to the effect that Skynet has determined that insufficient memory is available at this location and that you need to connect a memory stick with at least 10,000 KB of space available together with `` Retry '' and `` Cancel '' buttons . Having heard that this sort of things does actually occur with certain BDs ( `` Starship Troopers '' for example ) I first connected a USB memory stick and hit the `` Retry '' button several times but to no avail . I was just about ready to return the disc as defective when , finally out of desperation , I hit the `` Cancel '' button which , lo and behold , started the menu sequence . If this is the studio 's idea of a practical joke , I think it is in very very poor taste.From then on the menu sequence keeps going on and on through one meaningless layer after another until finally you get to the `` Play '' button . All of this takes a good bit of time to load and is quite annoying	-1
An average to poor release with only slightly better than DVD Picture Quality and just a standard definition Dolby Digital soundtrack ( probably straight from the earlier DVD releases ) ... Where is the uncompressed LPCM , Dolby TrueHD , or DTS-HD MA audio track ? TheTerminator 2 : Judgment Day ( Skynet Edition ) [ Blu-ray ] ( or it 's Steel Tin special edition version ) is a much better release with better picture and a true HD soundtrack .	-1
Have the whole Terminator series . Love them all . But not thrilled with # 2 version on DVD . Wish I could find the original.If you loved this movie in the theater you will be not happy with this version .	-1
This movie reminds me of something that happened to me when I was 10 years old ( 1979 ) . My stepmother ( at the time ) said that we ( me , my Dad , her , and my two stepbrothers ) HAD to go see this movie that was coming out , and we HAVE to see it the VERY FIRST weekend that it comes out . Well , we waited for over an hour ( in line ) to get the tickets . As it turned out , it was so crowded in the theater that we could n't even sit all together . I sat by myself , while my Dad sat with one of my stepbrothers and my stepmother sat with the other . Well , all the hype about the movie turned out to be just that : HYPE . As we were filing out like cattle , I heard more than one negative comment about the film , and , if I remember correctly , I believe this particular movie was gone from theaters in just over 2 months . The name of the movie ? ? ? -- METEOR . Never heard of it ? Well , there were no crotch shots , or any nudity or icepick murders , but had there been , the movie still would have sucked .	-1
Do n't get me wrong ... .there was great dancing on this movie . The stars were awesome , as well . I just could not stand the plot , and still ca n't . Hate everything about it EXCEPT the dancing .	-1
There is too much swearing . Perhaps this is realistic in some circles , but the constant swearing is too much for me .	-1
I was so happy to finally get the 10th Ann . version home and into my DVD , because frankly it is a movie that I can watch multiple times and still find new things in it . And also there was a commentary track on it , oh and there is one , but it is a & quot ; Interview & quot ; style commentary track , using past interviews with cast and crew . Not what I was expecting , would have loved to have had the Director commenting on the film as it played out in front of him , like in other DVD 's . So again I am let down by a great movie that has been moved to DVD with not much more than archived material .	-1
This movie was terrible . The only thing salvageable was the awesome acting other than that it was just terrible . A weak and convoluted story , majority of the movie is in a warehouse with the characters just yapping away and in the end ( spoiler alert ) they all shoot each other ! ! ! ! I really do n't get why this is a cult classic .	-1
In the p -- sing contest that is fan favorites of all time , Reservoir Dogs garners plenty of praise . Film geeks , Tarantino-heads , cult elitists , and mainstream critics seeking street cred all give excessive props to Quentin Tarantino 's directorial debut . I 've avoided watching it for a long time simply because I knew I 'd have a hard time separating the hype from my ability to enjoy the film.Alas , a good friend brought the film over the other night , gushing about it and warning me that he 'd have a hard time not quoting lines throughout , and I was finally forced to watch Reservoir Dogs . Verdict ? Easily among the top ten most overrated films I 've ever seen . Did n't see that coming ; did you ? The biggest problem I have with RD is that it feels incomplete . It plays like a cruelly drawn out section of what should 've been a larger whole . Characters are two-dimensional , the plot is thin , and the strong suit of QT 's films , his snappy , quotable dialogue , is strained and surprisingly banal . Michael Madsen 's sadistic Mr. Blonde gets most of the choicer lines , but he 's played so robotically that any power the words might have is lost amidst his flippant delivery . The script relies too much on vulgarity and shock instead of his usual brilliant concoction of intelligence , comedy , and intensity . Furthermore , Madsen is n't the only one who seems to be playing a caricature . Buscemi , Keitel , Roth , Penn , and Tierney all play ludicrously typecast characters , rendering RD as something approaching a half-baked Tarantino offering instead of the more nuanced , fully-formed , and complete film I think it could have been.It 's easy to see why Reservoir Dogs is Tarantino 's first film because it has hints of what makes later films so great . It 's baffling to me , however ; why so many hail this as his best when the coarseness of it is revealed in every scene . Then again , maybe that 's what people like about it . For me , it is an average movie at best , and the worst of his canon I 've seen .	-1
The ONLY reason this video is in my home is because it is my husband 's video . The movie lacks a plot , or any real substance . The level of violence is completely unneccessary and gory . Despite starring some of Hollywood 's heavyweights , it is a true let-down . If you are looking for action , appropriate violence and a REAl plot , investigate Tarantino 's masterful `` True Romance . ''	-1
Boring , boring , boring . If you want to turn it on just for the noise factor , go ahead . It does not come with my recommendation . Bad acting .	-1
Oliver Stone yet again tramples and distorts the truth - this time the victim is Jim Morrison and not the U.S. government . Every scene is either blown way out of context or it never actually happened : There was no acid trip to the desert ; Pam and Jim did NOT meet the way it was depicted in this film ; Patricia Kennealy NOT meet Jim at the time and place shown in this movie ; neither did Patricia meet Pam in that ridiculous & quot ; Thanksgiving & quot ; scene ( which , by the way , never happened either ) . Val Kilmer 's character comes across as an airheaded baffoon - never to match the personality with Morrison 's geniusness . Furthermore , Kyle McLaughlan 's performance as Ray Manzarek ( another genius ) is lame ; Kevin Dillon 's portrayal of John Densmore is that of an uptight and neurotic Jim Morrison-hater ; and Robby Krieger is an airhead as well . ALL FALSE ! This movie was not about the Doors , or Jim Morrison 's life , nor was it about America in the 1960 's . The only thing good and authentic about this film is the music . I just ca n't help but wonder why Manzarek did n't make a film about Morrison . After all , Ray Manzarek has a graduate degree from film school and he was with Morrison from the beginning to the end , and they were the best of friends . Maybe one day , huh Ray ? Until then , I advise anyone NOT to see this awful and disrespectful movie .	-1
If you love the real Doors , stay clear of this miasma.The Doors , I always thought were the greatest rock band of all time , but this vapid flick , created by a brain-dead Hollywood dodo makes the late , great Jim Morrison and the rest of The Doors look foolish , idiotic and talenless goofballs.This travesty of a flick basically left me fairly angry . I may just have to re-read ( for the third time ) No One Here Gets Out Alive , and will surely play some Doors music to get rid of the aftertaste left in this viewer 's mouth by the rancid Oliver Stone attempt .	-1
The Doors - directed by Oliver Stone - is a sad story about the 60 's rock group and legend Jim Morrison , lead singer , poet and songwriter . The movie covers the period from 1965-1971 . Val Kilmer stars as Jim Morrison , a very intelligent man who is his own worst enemy . He can not handle the pressures of success . We see a slow train wreck as he turns to excesses in drugs , drink , women and exhibitionism.In the beginning ( 1965 ) he is going to college , but also a Southern California beach boy , writing poetry , finding his first true love . It could be the start of Beach Blanket Bingo for that matter . A friend helps Jim form the Doors rock group ( named after the book by Aldus Huxley `` The Doors of Perception '' ) and from there on it is a marathion of drugs , drink , egotism , confusion and despair . Depending on how much you enjoy the 1960 's counterculture will be how you view this movie . It hypnotizes in the treadmill of drug trips , crazy outfits , California , trendy clubs , Andy Warhol parties , and outrageous behavior.As fabulous as Val Kilmer plays Jim Morrison , the drugged , halucinagenic excess becomes boring fast . The opporutnity lost is that Morrison had talent with words , high intelligence , but spent it on the dark side . Seeing this movie I am wondering if he could have been pulled from the abyss with better handlers and some on-going therapy . Morrison died in Paris at the young age of 27 and is buried in a near-by cemetery for famous artists . Overall , the movie seemed like a long tabloid expose and I felt like this was an intrusion on the Morrison 's privacy.It also starred Meg Ryan ( as Morrison 's girlfriend ) , and the Doors group played by Frank Whaley , Kyle MacLachlan	-1
... and much more Oliver Stone 's vision of what the Doors ' music and Jim 's life was , truth be damned . Supposedly , Stone was inspired by the book No One Here Gets Out Alive ( written by Jerry Hopkins in 1973-74 , but not published until 1980 when Danny Sugerman , Jim 's one-time teenage factotum , did some judicious rewriting ) , but very little of the book , even , is present in this film . I had to see it three times just to believe what I was seeing -- in short , an absolute hatchet job on Jim Morrison , and nothing like the real Jim at all.I honestly have no idea where the scene with Jim locking Pam in a burning closet came from ; nowhere in the Doors ' history does this incident appear . Jim did not meet Patricia Kennealy in 1967 ( Kennealy herself has verified this in her book , Strange Days : My Life With and Without Jim Morrison ) at a press conference ; their first meeting was a private interview in New York City in January 1969 . And she was not the girl who was with him backstage in New Haven when he was famously maced by a cop , then told that story onstage and was promptly arrested for doing so . Jim was not the sadistic , unfeeling creature portrayed in the film -- you honestly do n't feel sorry for him when he dies at the end -- and even the infamous `` Miami Incident '' is misportrayed . He did not offer to show off his penis to the audience , and although he did attempt to do so , he was forcibly restrained from it by one of the band 's roadies . And Pam was not with him during the trial , which stretched out over many months between 1969 and 1970 ; Jim never said of his handfasting to Kennealy that `` I was stoned , it seemed like a fun thing to do at the time . '' He was very serious about his vows to her ( and no , she is not paying me to say any of this . I 've read her book and I 've read some of the other books , and I think I 'm able to judge what 's truth and what 's clearly fabrication ) .Also , we 'd do well to remember that Stone was off in Vietnam while much of this was going on -- his own idea , and given a fictitious-yet-autobiographical treatment in Platoon -- and just apart from that , he tends toward sweeping overstatement . This film is just a mess ; do n't waste your time or money .	-1
Director : Robert KurtzmanCast : Tammy Lauren , Andrew Divoff , Robert Englund , Chris Lemmon , Wendy Benson-Landes , Tony Crane , Jenny O'Hara , Kane Hodder.Running Time : 90 minutesRated R for horror violence , gore , and language.Aimed directly at the `` Fangoria '' crowd , though not much fun for anyone else , `` Wishmaster '' is presented by executive producer Wes Craven and directed by makeup maestro Robert Kurtzman , so it 's no surprise the movie emphasizes makeup and visual effects at the expense of plot and characterization . The story revolves around an ancient djinn ( Andrew Divoff ) , trapped in an emerald for centuries and accidentally released in modern day America , whereupon it takes human form and grants various characters a series of `` wishes '' , all of which backfire in gruesome fashion . For no discernible reason , the monster targets gem specialist Tammy Lauren , whose three wishes can release the djinn 's evil minions from the Other Side . Naturally , she resists and the evil wishmaster goes on a torrid killing spree.Stuffed full of `` Fangoria '' -friendly cameos ( Robert Englund from `` A Nightmare on Elm Street '' , Tony Todd , the evil hooked villain in `` Candyman '' , Kane Hodder , Jason Vorhees from the `` Friday the 13th '' sequels , Ted Raimi , Reggie Bannister , Angus Scrimm , the Tall Man from `` Phantasm '' , etc . ) and visual references to earlier , better pictures ( `` Hellraiser '' , `` The Thing '' , and countless others ) , the movie has the same kind of bland , homogenized script and production design which afflicts many similar movies from the same period , and the results could n't be less appealing . Content to showcase a series of grisly set-pieces , most of which , admittedly , are ingeniously designed and presented , the movie has n't an ounce of depth . Lauren carries the picture with her gutsy performance as the imperilled heroine , and Kurtzman orchestrates the mayhem with enough flash-bang-wallop to hide the scenario 's shortcomings , but the story is worthless , despite a smart climactic twist . Not one of the better of its kind .	-1
I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theatre when it came out . I used a lot of drugs back then , so that explains it . I just watched this again yesterday . Folks , I literally SUFFERED through & quot ; Jacob 's Ladder & quot ; this time around . I could n't wait for it to end . Tin Robbins is usually pretty good , but even he seems bored to death in his role . I would not recommend this film to anyone and I do not understand why it 's gotten such high praise .	-1
Could not figure out what was happening , but then , I do n't think the protagonist could figure it out either.Skip unless you like dark , disturbing movies .	-1
I was so looking forward to see this movie because it featured some of my favorite actors- Sam Neill , Anna Paquine etc . But gosh , I feel so ashamed of dragging my mother in seeing this movie with me . It was the two of the most confusing-ist , boring-ist and disgusting-ist hours of my life.first of all this movie is n't at all difficult to comprehend , a Maori guy blackmails a mute , married woman to have sex with him just so she can get her most beloved possession , her piano back . She falls for him afterwards ( ? ! ) and her husband got jealous ( OF COURSE ! ) and try to win her for himself , but finally gave her up . happy ending yippy ! Why is it boring ? Like so many other people have said , it dragged on way too long , and the scenes are not at all pleasant.I have NEVER been SO DISGUSTED with the nudity and the sex . Usually I have no problem with it at all and I can feel the love . But this time , GEEEEZUUUS , it 's just all porn , nothing else . Why in the world would Ada fall for a guy LIKE THAT ? He 's rude , a pervert , has no respect for women-basically take what he want just for sex , and not to mention all-time UGLY ! Instead of a love story , it seemed to me that Ada , after having sex with the guy , was jonsing to have sex again when she was nuzzling with her daughter and touching her husband 's butt ( which really disturbed him , hmmm I wonder why ) . There was NO chemistry , just erotism.lots of things are unexplained , as for example WHY ON EARTH did Neill 's character marry her ? What 's with the show thingy ? To be honest , Neill 's character was much more sympathetic than the two `` lovers '' ( in quote because I do n't feel like they are , they feel more like `` sex partners '' ) . But in order to make him look like the `` bad guy '' , they had him chop off a finger of Ada's-simply because else-wise ( without extreme violence ) his rage and anger is totally understandable . Unlike Baines , he gave Ada space to become more `` affectionate '' instead of just `` taking '' her through blackmaile . the only thing he did wrong was selling her piano , but that 's only because of the pervert want to use it for Ada 's body and the husband really has no money-sooooo why marry ? ? ? geeez ! the only two good thing I can say about the movie is 1. the acting , especially Anna Paquine and Holly Hunter . 2. the music , the music of the piano theme was beautiful.And NO , the scenery was disgusting as well , it was muddy , dirty and just feel like not the place you wan na go . Also , the whole Maori situation made me have NO respect for their culture , unlike other movie involved natives have.The piano is SO OVERRATED , that 's my conclusion , I even told people if you want your kids to never have sex , make them watch this movie , they 'll never want to have sex ever again .	-1
The Piano bombed . The only positive part about this movie is the music . The parts that some might consider erotic had me reeking . If you like to read maybe you should read this book , for fiery romance , erotic excitement and a good story . While reading it play a CD with lovely piano music . See the link.At My Father 's Knee	-1
First of all , I saw this movie recently again ( albeit , grudgingly ) and still did not like the subject of the film , but I do have to say that the acting was excellent and I give Jane Campion credit for presenting this story on screen in a unique and stylized way . That said , all bets are off from that point on.I do n't understand how Holly Hunter 's character could adore such a man who is using a piano ( the only thing she initially loves and adores ) to bribe her for sex . What exactly is the attraction ? I guess in that time and environment that is the ONLY man that treats her better than her husband . It 's nice to know that times have progressed.The story is very sadistic and not the least bit romantic as was attested to by some of my female friends . AND , the setting in the New Zealand rainforest is dreary , gray , sticky and just unpleasant.Not likely to view this movie a third time , ever !	-1
This is mostly a boring movie . The story line is somewhat interesting and good acting , just had a hard time staying awake	-1
Did n't the United States loose the war in Vietnam ? Or I am just out on a limb here ? Next week : Rambo goes to Afghanistan , to aid al-Qaeda and the Taliban against the evil Russians ...	-1
For me this follow up to First Blood is the worst of the trilogy.Vet John Rambo ( Stallone ) who is in prision convited of various charges is given the chance of a full pardon if he joins into a top secret mission in southeast Asia to take graphic pictures of the vietnamese pow camps and find evidence of American pows held there without entering in combat with the enemy.After his accidental airborne launch he contacts with a vietnamese intelligence agent of his side which leads to the camps.After he enters in the camp and recues some pows he is sold by ruthless mercenaries whom does n't pick up in the site of the landing he is captured by some russian soldiers led by a sinister and sadistic litenaunt who tortures him to death in order to seek who he is and who send him.Rambo made it up and escapes from the camp with some pows and destroy it with a chopper.After killing the Russian officer chopper he gets it right to get things with the intel gov that send to that mission.He destroys all the computers in the control center and with his knife persues Murdock ( Napier ) to locate all pows in this camp or he would locate.Pure routine .	-1
The only good thing about this piece of schlock is that it was n't boring.It does n't do much justice to real life vietnam vets nor does it hide any pretense of portraying realism in war.My favorite scene has to be when RAMBO was in the helicopter and he fired a LAW without taking a shred of damage to himself or his copter.If you want an action movie without much intelligence , check it out .	-1
Due to the great success of `` First Blood '' fans demanded that Stallone grab his knife and bow and return for some action . `` Rambo First Blood part 2 '' did deliver the action , but the story lacked after the increadible story that `` First Blood '' was . `` Rambo First Blood part 2 '' picks up right about where the first one leaves off . Rambo has been in prison for a while . The film opens with him chopping rocks . Col. Trautman comes to tell Rambo that there is some strong emotions invested in the pows left in Vietnam and they are looking for someone who can go into Vietnam and investigate . Rambo excepts this offer as it gets him out of prision and back to what he does best.When Rambo meets the man in charge of this mission , he is not impressed due to his lack of interest in Vietnam , and his lack of knowledge about the topic.When Rambo lands in Vietnam and finds the village he is supposed to take pictures of , he discovers the camp is not empty and in fact there are about a dozen pows . Rambo takes one of the pows to the extraction site and Murdock the man in charge orders an abort of the mission . Rambo is left in Vietnam.Overall , Rambo part 2 fails to live up to the original `` First Blood . '' The plot is not the best and the effort was focused too much on the action .	-1
This is one silly film . It has such daft gunfights that you long for the realism of Buck Rogers.Passes the time , do n't expect luxuries like plot or characters , though.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys	-1
Again , the first movie was fantastic , but this third one was so idiotic ... .well , it just is . Why would any helicopter fly at ground level against a tank ? Please . That part alone destroyed the movie .	-1
& quot ; FIRST BLOOD & quot ; , based on David Morrell 's book , is already a classic , well conducted and convinvent . But after that , the John Rambo character acquired a life of his own in the hands of Hollywood , and the sequels RAmbo II and III sucks , showing Stallone at the lowest level of interpretation an acting and screenplay of his career . Avoid it !	-1
Its funny to think that Rambo 's buddies in this movie are the same people responsible for 911 , well , maybe more sad than funny..Stallone mumbles his way between action scenes ; taking his bow and arrows to Afganistan in search of his mentor who has been taken hostage by the evil Soviets . Stuff does blow up real good.This movie is simplistic and cartoonish but it is entertaining ; just like today 's American foriegn policy .	-1
Best of it kind in the weard fealds of propaganda warfear .

This Movie was absolute TRASH ! ! ! I liked the idea of having Dolph Lundgren as the Puniser and Louis Gossett Jr. was great in this movie like any other . The story was lamb , the punisher did n't even have the skull shirt ! ! ! HOW GAY ! ! ! THIS MOVIE SUCKED . I 'm a major Punisher FAN ! Do n't waste your time on this version . THE THOMAS JANE version is the BEST ! ! ! Please ... if you have this version of the movie , before you watch it ... wipe your ass with it and burn it ! ! ! !	-1
I have never seen such a mock off . The People who made this piece of crap were probably a couple back to the 60 's crackheads who just took a glimpse at the front cover of a copy of the punisher comics and just said hey this looks pretty cool lets just destroy the original story of the punisher and make a completey not well thought of plot and the reason why I call them crackheads because HOW THE HELL CAN YOU THE BLAST'EN SKULL , I mean really the one question that I myself and whoever else actually read at least one of the stories of the punisher have got to ask is that did this movie had anything to do , was this movie suppose to be based on the comic book of the punisher ? You know thank god for the new version of the punisher based on the real story of the punisher with the skull with a kickass better actor starring as the punisher and with my favorite actor , Jon Travolta starring as the kickass villian and if you do n't believe me on that go watch Broken Arrow , Face-Off , and Swordfish .	-1
I 'll admit , Dolph Lundgren is an inspired choice to play the Punisher , but this film just is n't all that good . Lundgren looks bored all the time and Louis Gossett Jr. looks very embarrassed to be in this movie . The plot is about a gang war that erupts in the city and several children are stolen by the Yakuza . The Punisher is sent to the rescue , and there are tons of gunfights , fistfights , and swordfights . One scene is really wasted , though . At one point , Lundgren and Jeroen Krabbe arrive in a room full of ninjas . They simply open fire and kill them all . Bummer . I was hoping for a cool fight scene , not some bland massacre . This movie seems to have a bad case of ADD . Random scenes of violence are intermixed with scenes of Lundgren riding on a motorcycle in the sewers to Krabbe whining about being in the mafia . The script never finds any real focus , and the movie just dies on the screen . There are some cool action moments , but after a while , the movie gets tedious .	-1
Yikes ... what a sad state of affairs THIS was ( and still is ) ! If there was any indicator of the Punisher declining in popularity ( not to mention comic-book revenues ) in the early 90s , this movie is probably as good a harbinger as any ! Sub-standard action sequences , the whole Vietnam-war veteran past of our anti-hero gone , his computer-whiz sidekick Microchip has been replaced by an alcoholic has-been stage actor , and he ai n't even sportin ' the big death's-head skull on his chest ! And where 's Jigsaw , our main man 's most notable adversary ? Aside from Pun himself , this flick has none of the other characters that made up his world in the comics ! Dolph Lundgren 's infamous stoicism works surprisingly well for the character-well , for the most part , anyway . Sadly , when he tries to do a few brief bits of happiness & amp ; fear in this less-than-rousing actioner , it just looks forced , like they 're beyond his emotional spectrum . Which they just might be , who knows . And Louis Gossett , Jr seems to be just biding his time between ` Iron Eagle ' sequels here . His ultra-hackeneyed-and-cliched performance as our anti-hero 's former police partner has been seen many a time before in far better shoot-em-ups.Still , there are those silly moments of cheesy fun , which I like to experience in the movies I watch from time to time . Sadly , there ai n't quite enough cheddary footage here to keep my interest for too long . Fortunately , the remote 's fast-forward button is merely a finger away ... ` Late	-1
This movie is *bad* . The `` plot '' makes no sense , and the ending even less . It is stupid , slow , insipid , and utterny nonsensical . I wish that MST3K had gotten ahold of this film ; only they could have mocked it the way it so desperately deserves to be mocked . This movie is *that bad*.And it 's *boring* , too . Kristoferson and Ladd have absolutely ZERO chemistry . No , in fact , they have NEGATIVE chemistry . Kristoferson could n't act is way out of this script , and Ladd ... well , jeez , what could one expect from an ex-Charlie 's Angel ? It 's also *ugly* . The costumes , set designs , and special effects would have been bad in 1989 , and have n't aged well . Post-apocolyptic futures can look cool ( ROAD WARRIOR ) or even funky ( 12 MONKEYS ) , but here , it 's just lame . And the first `` effect '' in the film -- where two planes collide -- is a sad effort of blue-screening that my high-school film club could have outdone.Avoid at all costs . Waste no money . If your boyfriend or girlfriend owns it , break up with them ; it will be less painful.I have to go sanitize my home theatre now .	-1
This is the only movie I saw at the theatre where people literally went to the manager and asked for a refund . And this was at a dollar movie theatre ! Needless to say if you can avoid this do so . The plot was predictable when it made sense , and the actors looked like they had better things to do . A real time waster .	-1
Millenium was probably the most famous outing for Kris Kristoferson . Starring as a NTSB investigator , he stumbles upon time travelers from a future earth . The entire movie 's concept is interesting and innovative , however the acting is OK with dialog that seems forced and artificial at many places . Probably the biggest letdown of this potential blockbuster was the special effects , all of which seem fake . Everything from the robots in the future , to the opening scene when the pilots in one airline jet look out their cockpit to see another airline jet coming on top of them ; all the special effects could have been improved upon . Overall , an OK flick that is alright for at-home viewing .	-1
What a waste of shiny plastic disc ! Out of all the decent and semi-decent Sci-fi flicks , they pick the bottom of the barrel ! Millenium ... barely a sci-fi movie . Would you give a Kris Kristoferson movie more than 1 star ? Stargate ... OK movie , someone must like it as it now has a lame TV show.Capricorn 1 ... The only shinging star in the set , mainly due to it 's very dated look , and OJ Simpson ! What a load hooey , but in a cheesey , fun way . Without this movie , I would only give the collection 1 star ! Save your money . These movies can be bought seperately for less .	-1
How humbling and yet reassuring that my college-cultivated taste for this sort of mind-numbing , time-wasting art film form has withered completely at age 50 . Three-quarters of the way through this egocentric mess I hit the eject button and slid the offender back in the box . No regrets , however . Whenever I see a film video box with the name Peter Greenaway , I 'll go reach for the original Diabolique for some good old fashioned husband-killing entertainment .	-1
Forget mere historical inaccuracies , the biggest hurdle that ` Young Guns ' failed to clear was to be remotely enjoyable . The film is just bland , with a cast of characters and actors who should have been at least entertaining and wound up being just as bland as everything else . The story of Billy the Kid , much like the story of Jesse James , should be rich with character development and stirring social commentary . If you are n't going to even try to be something intricate and detailed , at least have a smashing good time giving us thrills , chills and gunfights . Sadly , ` Young Guns ' ca n't even get that right . The interchange of characters is dreadfully morose and the action scenes are just mediocre at best . The clich & eacute ; d depictions of the characters are forgettable and at times even cringe inducing , and the repartee between the actors is surprisingly dull . Kiefer Sutherland is the only standout here , but even his steely gaze and developed backstory ca n't save this dreadful ride .	-1
This is an utterly unhistorical movie . The real Billy the Kid was basically a loner who shunned gangs such as the & quot ; Regulators & quot ; bunch in this movie . One of the characters is a deputy marshal who throws away his badge and utters the usual lines about how the law is really on the side of evil . In this case , the ex-deputy joins the rest in a revelry of mindless violence all of which is committed in the name of a good cause , although it is hard to see how the violence did anything constructive.Basically , this is just another empty action flick of mindless violence and mayhem with characters who have deluded themselves into thinking that they are the good guys . Worst of all , the movie basically portrays these juvenile delinquents as being on the right side . The idea that violence is an acceptable thing to engage in if you believe that you are in the right is just simply not the kind of message that Hollywood should be conveying to young people.In summation , this is an awful movie .	-1
The premise is pure recycled Terminator 2 , and the performances lead the viewer to believe Arnold is Oscar-worthy in comparison . Van Damme and Lundgren star as soldiers who killed each other in Vietnam , only to be reanimated 25 years later and continue their battle in present day . If only they 'd stayed dead.The & quot ; plot & quot ; develops nowhere beyond the point when both soldiers experience flashbacks that revive their past rivalry . The remainder of the film is simply a SLOW , boring chase sequence climaxing in the requisite final face-off.Van Damme , believe it or not , fails miserably at acting wooden . His attempt to mimic Schwarzenegger 's role as the Terminator is so bad that it 's not even laughable , just painful - he looks like he 's trying to hold back a giggle the entire time . Lundgren , on the other hand , overacts just as badly , trying to seethe evil as the villain and simply reminds the viewer why he 's best tolerated when he keeps his mouth shut.Considering the & quot ; talent & quot ; involved , however , one does n't come to UNIVERSAL SOLDIER expecting performances and plotlines out of CITIZEN KANE . One simply expects action , and lots of it . And that 's where this film fails as well . For a film about soldiers , there 's little firepower and gunplay to be found . Van Damme 's martial arts skills are barely showcased , save for a brawl at a diner and during his final battle with Lundgren . And Lundgren 's trademark ... wait ... his fighting skills ? ... no ... his muscles ? ... not really ... well , anyway , Dolph Lundrgen spends most of this movie in a truck . I wish a truck would run over this DVD .	-1
I got a chance to see this movie recently on IFC ( Independent Film Channel ) . I was so intrigued by the concept of the plot and have found over the years that almost anything Harvey Keitel is in is well worth watching . Unfortunately , this film was n't one of them . The problem here is not the plot or the acting . It 's the film maker . Period . My impression after watching this was that the director must have been a first year film student who was trying every trick he heard in class without really understanding how it impacts up on the screen.Harvey Keitel plays a cop who 's scraping bottom . He loses consistantly to the bookies and now is up to his ears in gambling debt . Add to that he 's a drug addict and uses his position as a detective to , shall we say , take advantage of underage girls . Basically , he has no redeeming qualities . When a nun is brutally raped the case falls into his lap and as he investigates crime he begins to slowly yearn for a redemption that he thought was beyond his reach.Sounds like a good plot , right ? Well it is , on paper . The possibilities here are just endless . But from concept-to-filming something went very wrong . More and more , as you watch the plot becomes secondary . Director Abel Ferrara throws bad scene after bad scene at a wall , hoping it will stick , and very few do . Two examples of a couple of scenes that really stand out to me as horrible film making : The first , when the nun is being attacked we are treated to a series of quick shots with the camera , first of the nun as she is being raped , then cut quickly to a icon of Christ , then back to the nun as she is screaming , then back to Christ , then back ... .well you get the idea . I 'm assuming that this was suppose be an analogy that the nun 's rape was like the crucifixion of the Savior . Only , it 's really a bad analogy . And the quickness of the cuts may have been done to try and build the tempo of the scene but instead was just plain annoying.But the worst scene , by far , was the full frontal nudity of Keitel . For two reasons : 1 ) with apologies to the actor , it 's just not a pleasent sight . I could have gone the rest of my life without seeing that image . But more importantly : 2 ) Keitel 's nudity really had no reason to be included in this scene . None . It did not , in any way , advance the plot of the film . This specific scene shows him on a drug-induced high and we see him swaying back and forth in this trance . OK , showing him high does advance the movie but the nudity was n't necessary to do that . It was like the director was saying , `` Hey look what I got Harvey Keitel to do . '' To be honest I 'm not a big fan of full frontal nudity , in most cases I think it cheapens the scene , but can at least understand it IF THERE IS A PURPOSE TO IT . Here there is n't . It was a waste of time and film and made a bad film watching experience even worse.Again , this is a bad film . If it were possible to give it zero stars then I would have . I would n't recommend this to any one .	-1
Being a fan of Harvey Keitel , I had to go with my friend 's recommendation to see The Bad Lieutenant . However , I was a bit disappointed . Having seen Resevoir Dogs , Pulp Fiction , et al , I figured this one would be a good one . But it was basically an hour and a half of pervasive drug use , obsession over baseball games , and flat dialog.Yes , I understood the idea of him being a filthy low-life who redeems himself , but it could have been written better , and it was n't as alarming as I was led to believe . The nun rape scene was short and not terribly shocking , and the nude scene other reviewers mentioned was dull and bizarre to say the least . By the end of the movie , you 'll be thoroughly tired of him making noises like a goat in heat.Now , do n't get me wrong , Harvey Keitel is an EXCELLENT actor . I LOVE his work . This one just fell a bit flat . For seedy 'underbelly of society ' style shock value , I 'd rather pull out `` Crimes of Passion '' , or `` Kalifornia '' , quite honestly . ( `` Crimes of Passion '' 's scene with the nighstick , the cop , and the Ivory soap comment is much more vile and shocking than the nun scene here ) .It does get a thumbs up for one scene near the end where he 's yelling at a Jesus hallucination in the church . It 's got quite a visual intensity to it . And for the ladies like myself looking forward to the `` Keitel Beefcake Factor '' , trust me , `` The Piano '' was a much better bang for your buck . Harvey can polish my piano any time !	-1
Keitel has been one of my favorite actors over the years and is the only reason I saw this in a movie theatre , etc . Alas , this flick put me to sleep . Where is the writing ? Does this `` director '' know anything about story-telling/filmmaking ? Does he read at all ? IS HE A READER ? Or is he just another bogus , so-called eccentric hack ? I suspect it might be the latter.Why talented actors ( for the most part ) continue to appear in this `` director 's '' films is totally baffling.Wait a minute -- on second thought , could it be $ $ $ ? Sure . It 's a paycheck . Only it seemsa truly high price to pay .	-1
Do you like Havey Keitel ? Yeah , me too . How about gritty detective stories ? Same here . Dramas ? I know , so do I . Well , this movie is all of that and more and I did n't like it at all.Bad Lieutenant is n't an easy movie to watch and not because of the subject matter , which was bad enough , but because it really does n't have a plot . The story is about a police lieutenant who happens to be . . . bad . In fact , he 's so bad , that if the name of the movie had been The Very Bad Lieutenant it would n't have been an exaggeration . The Lieutenant ( he had no other name in the movie ) is bad in the sense that he drinks , drugs , swears , lies , whores , gambles and pretty much anything else he wants to do without misgiving . Or does he ? The Lieutenant appears to have another side to him that gave me the impression that he knew what he was doing was wrong , and that it was all contrary to everything he was taught growing up , but because he was in so deep there was nothing he could do ( or wanted to do ? ) about it . Or maybe my impression was just me trying to make some sense of his actions . There was nothing in the movie that gave us any insight into the Lieutenant and truth be told , by the end of the movie , I did n't really care . In fact , if a 40-foot alligator would have crawled up from the sewer and started doing battle with Godzilla , I do n't even that would have made me care . The only thing I cared about while watching Bad Lieutenant was the little counter on the DVD player as it worked it 's way closer and closer to 90-whatever minutes . What little plot there was involved a disturbing sex crime and the Lieutenant trying to solve the crime . The Lieutenant 's motive is anyone 's guess because the movie offered no real insight into the character and/or how he got where he was in life . We can make some guesses , but that 's about it.Harvey Keitel is very good in the movie and it 's his performance alone that saves Bad Lieutenant and makes the movie worth watching , but only if you 're a Harvey Keitel fan . Bad Lieutenant also had some nice scenes of New York and there was a baseball subplot that I enjoyed.I would n't recommend Bad Lieutenant anyone other than the absolute Harvey Keitel fan .	-1
They should have ( EDITED VERSION ) next to the title . Very deceptive with entire scenes deleted . If you are looking for the original full-length movie , this is NOT IT ! Okay if they want to edit , but please WARN people before they spend their money .	-1
The acting by Harvey Keitel was solid , but that is the only positive thing I can say about the movie . It is a dark , disgusting , cynical view of humanity with virtually no redeeming qualities . The characters are repulsive , the violence gratuitous , and the story - non-existent . It is a series of violent scenes which make one question why the movie was even made . It is not commercial . It is not artistic . It is simply grotesque , depressing , and painful to watch . I wanted to turn it off several times , but forced myself to watch until the ending , all the while hoping for some redeeming quality , or for an uptick in the movie . I watched with several others , who felt the same way . We picked this for a group of guys as an & # 34 ; action flick & # 34 ; from two decades ago that we had hoped would be a & # 34 ; classic find & # 34 ; , and we were all disappointed that we wasted 90 minutes . Do n't waste your time - this is Hollywood at its worst . And as a group , we generally like most movies and can find some redeemable aspects to most films . For this one , it is 90 minutes of wasting your life . It make the viewer wonder - why was this movie ever made ?	-1
They need to remake this in 3-D. As I write this , 3-D is on its way out ( again ) , but could be saved by the right `` serious '' movie . `` On Golden Pond '' is that movie . I would recommend Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus to play the elderly couple ( in age makeup , of course - or maybe not ) , and Bristol Palin in the Jane Fonda role .	-1
How so many people could give a positive review to a movie that is written , directed and especially acted as badly as this is beyond me . My guess is that most of them were teenagers when this came out and have a kind of soft for it . Unfortunately , that soft spot is in their heads .	-1
I do n't understand why everyone 's giving this movie rave reviews ! The actings horrible , the film 's dragged out , and the cliche 's pile up so high that I could n't even see the movie at the very end ! When I watched the part of `` Chaplin '' sitting in his sofa with a glass of wine contemplating how he could help the common man I wanted to throw up and laugh out loud at the same time -- not a good combination.To reiterate:1 ) Bad , wooden acting2 ) Dragged out storyline3 ) Bad plot ( hard to tell what 's going on at times ) 4 ) Unimaginable amount of cliche'sStay away from this movie .	-1
I kept watching it in hopes it would get better . When it was over , I questioned my intelligence for watching it all .	-1
From the content of a few other reviews I thought this film might be interesting given its taunted mathematical theme . However , there was no real mathematical content to support the story . The main character , Max , never demonstrated any of the intellectual talent he was supposed to possess . Instead he was in essence a mystic who believed in a predictable and understandable mathematical structure of nature but demonstrated only a superficial basis for such a belief . Because the film had little substance , it had to inject Max 's unsuccessful attempts to predict the price movement of individual stocks as well as touching upon deciphering the mythical mathematical code that underlies the Torah in order to meet the length of a feature film . The absurdity of these sideshows further detracted from Max 's credibility as a mathematician.Max , who was mentally unbalanced at the beginning of the film , descended into the chaos of his imagination and became self-destructive . It is unclear how much of this was drug induced hallucination . I would draw a parallel between him and a man who is obsessed with finding a god who is driven crazy by the unfulfilled expectation of actually finding one , thus he falsely claims success . This story is much more about mental illness than mathematical or scientific theory and findings . The injection of more credibility into Max at the onset of the film would have enabled the filmmakers to show a much more drastic decline in Max 's condition . Instead , he only went the short way from very nuts to completely nuts . It might have some appeal to those who have an interest in psychiatry , but I suspect those who have such an interest would possess a scientific curiosity that this film will leave unsatisfied.I would have rated the film with one star , but I must admit I have seen a few that were worse .	-1
... This movie was terrible and I wanted to like it so much . It 's the only movie I have ever seen [ UPDATE : this review was written before the release of A Beautiful Mind ] to show people playing GO . It has alot of fascinating ideas , it just does n't know what to do with any of them . What is so astonishing is that these ideas which the movie barely scratches the surface of , the depth of GO , the Fibonnaci series , are so rich as to be wide open to he possiblity of a really great story . It 's just too bad the writer could see none of it ... or at least how to make a movie about them without resorting to a cheap cop-out ending . Too bad , the ending ruined an otherwise enjoyable movie ...	-1
Kind of like the old X Files gimmick of hinting at deeper mysteries without ever actually getting to an explanation or connection . Sort of like real life only when I 'm looking for entertainment , I prefer complete tales .	-1
as a friend of mine said . The storyline is simplistic , which would be no problem were the imagery not so overused and the dialogue not so terrible ( & quot ; But maybe it 's genius ! & quot ; -- perhaps the director 's wistful thoughts on his own film ? ) .Maybe this is why the movie is as bad as it is : it mixes the storyline of the quest to know the secrets of the universe with a bunch of paranoiac gibberish . It does n't focus enough on the emotional and spiritual consequences of Max 's quest to know the mind of God . We never get enough sense of Max Cohen as a character to empathize with him . Hence my feeling that the movie is juvenile , because it puts him through a lot without allowing us to feel with him .	-1
I didnt get caught up in Pi , it went to the extremes allmost a comic book , Name better than movie	-1
thats all i really wanted to say . this film is the worst . if you like it , there is something very wrong with you . this is a series of clich & eacute ; s that have no reason to be on screen . would rather stab hot needles in my eyes ...	-1
Saw this 1984 film on Netflix . I had never seen it before . Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a cyborg from the future who is not human . His mission is to kill a young woman ( Linda Hamilton ) because these creatures are going to take over the world but the son she will bear in the future will foil their plans . However , Michael Biehn , who also comes from the future but is human is out to stop all this and save the world.What follows are a lot of chase scenes , guns , explosions and other predictable special effects that were available to 1984 audiences . This fight does n't seem fair at first because the cyborg is not human and can grow new body parts when necessary . However there is no doubt how it will all turn out.The plot is simple , actually too simple for me . Once I figured it out I fell asleep and awoke just once in a while to the sound of explosions . I guess I 'm just not into this kind of film . But I 'm glad I tried to watch it just to check it out .	-1
I am a big fan of Peck and Olivier , and I was eager to see this movie so I ordered it as soon as it came out on DVD . What a disappointment . The plot is so ridiculous and the screenplay is terrible . Maybe the book was better but I do n't feel like reading it anymore . What a waste of a great cast . Olivier 's performance is believable but that 's it . And I mean IT . Nothing else is enjoyable in this waste of time and space on my DVD shelf . Poor Peck tries but sometimes I laugh when he recites some of his lines `` kill za boy '' and he is such a clich & eacute ; taken out of a comic book . Avoid at any cost . Bad bad bad.One Good thing though . Steve Guttenberg gets killed early in the movie . The pain was reduced .	-1
Seriously , just read some of them . They 're reviews for `` The Arrival '' not The Arrival II ... .Why amazon is allowing such reviews to even be on this page when they 're for a completely different product ? I do n't know , or care all that much , my guess is that they just do n't actually bother to read the stuff that gets submitted.As for The Arrival II -- it 's a cheesy made-for-tv quality movie that is actually possible for someone to enjoy , if they 're either drunk , or ... . did I already say drunk ? Yeah .	-1
This is nearly Identical to the original only with & # 34 ; unknown & # 34 ; actors that ca n't act yet , Bad effects , and a budget that must be a 100th of the first movie . An incredibly lazy attempt at a sequel	-1
I had forgotten watching this movie several years ago . I thought it thin in several categories , from acting to script . Wasted time .	-1
The script of this movie actually makes `` Category 7 '' seem believable . In a word , it is ludicrous . That said , though , Charlie Sheen 's performance makes it bearable , and at times even humorous and entertaining . The premise of the movie is that aliens have come to earth to set up factories to release massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in order to speed along `` man-made global warming '' to the point they will be able to take over the planet to be used for their own purposes . Ron Silver also turns in an entertaining performance as one ( two , actually ) of the villainous aliens . Silver , at this point in his career , was a political conservative and I have to believe he took this movie because of how silly it makes the concept of man made global warming look . One of his character 's final comments in the movie ( to Sheen ) is something akin to `` we 're only speeding up what you people are already doing to your own planet . what it would take you 10 more years to do , we can do in one . `` If you 're a warmer , chances are you actually will find this movie to be both believable and further `` proof '' of your beliefs . Even if you 're not a warmer , though , you 'll still find the movie to be humorous and entertaining . I watched the Blue-Ray version and thought both the picture and the sound quality were very good , especially for the price . I found it for $ 5 at Walmart .	-1
Good storyline , not great acting . Kind of predictable . Saw movie many years ago . Was worth second look . Was not Charlie Sheens best movie .	-1
Invasion of the bodysnatchers-like storyline . Nothing new but features some decent acting . Some weak special effects detract from the experience .	-1
One review stated `` Greatest movie ever made '' , another `` one of the funniest movies ever '' and , `` I laughed so hard it hurt '' , and another more accurate comment `` I found this video in the CHEAP section of the OLDER DVD 's '' ... daa it was in that section since , while humorous , it must have been made for kids ; Limited killing ( that 's ok ) , limited love interest ( so so ) , SUPER kick boxing ( looked animated ) , with a cute mangy dog that liked donuts . The story used every gag to hook the unwashed . The cranky `` sweet old man '' gets killed first thing , the likeable little kid who like to jump his `` cool '' bike , the fuzzy dog , the stereo typical drinking , loner bad ass cop and nasty boss , villains wanting to take over the world and kill all minorities etc . Watch the staged fights then return the video back to the rental store .	-1
Read the novel by Richard Matheson if you want a good ghost story . This movie is far too Hollywood and does nothing right except two scenes . It also blasphemies by including footage from Night of the Living Dead ! I barely made it through w/o turning off the movie and returning it right then and there . This is one of those movies that feels like it 's trying really hard to give you the finger . And & quot ; Paint It black & quot ; by The Rolling Stones , one of my favorite songs , appears only in one scene and it 's just a lame cover . AWFUL MOVIE !	-1
Alan Rickman does a fine job of being a perfect jerk of a husband , but outside of his great performance , the movie lacks interest . The movie could have had potential , but seems cut-up and fragmented in parts that just do n't make sense or play well with the story line . Those who think they are great at guessing the end of a movie before it 's over will have a challenge and a surprise here . If I had viewed this before purchase , it would never had made it to my personal library .	-1
Denise Austin 's Mat Workout Based on the Work of J.H . Pilates features two workout segments : Mat Workout # 1 ( all Pilates ) , and Mat Workout # 2 ( Combination of Yoga and Pilates ) .Mat Workout # 1 runs for 21 minutes . It features core Pilates exercises such as the Teaser , Leg Circles , the Hundred , and Leg Swings . However , Denise 's almost whispered and breathy instructions leave out many details for performing the exercises correctly . The Pilates method focuses on execution , not repetition , so it is essential that the exercises be performed precisely . While Denise explains modifications for beginners , there is no one in her class that demonstrates them for you . The class , also , features people who are well toned and slim , there are no & quot ; average & quot ; people who are beginners or less flexible in the class.Denise moves very , very quickly , especially in the single leg stretch move of the first mat workout . It is too fast to keep up with at times , especially if you might be new to Pilates movements.The second workout features Yoga moves reminscent of her Yoga Essentials workout . If you are familiar with her Sun Salutations series from Yoga Essentials , you will have no problem with this workout . However , if you have not done these moves before , be sure to take your time learning this segment . It will be challenging for you.The Bonus Features of the DVD include a Buttocks and Thighs workout , Recipes , Trailer , and Pilates Poses segment . The bonus thighs section is not as well produced as the other workouts , it is not polished . For example , the camera is not steady at the beginning of the workout . The Recipes include Island Chicken with Brown Rice , and a Fruit Cobbler . The trailer features all VHS titles , few of the featured workouts are available on DVD.Overall , there are better Pilates workouts out there , especially if you are a beginner . If you are at intermediate or advanced levels , this might be something different to add to your existing routines . Bear in mind that Pilates workouts are isometric workouts . It is essential to complement this workout with cardio and strength training if you want to see results in weight loss .	-1
This documentary was produced in 1988 By Nigel Turner and broadcast on Btitish TV . The station received many angry letters from viewers and from the British government who did an investigation and found out that most of the info on the documentary was not true or made up . Nigel Turner was forced to apologize and the film was not shown on British TV again . Then it was shown on The History Channel a few years ago and many angry letters were sent to the station including ones from former presidents Ford and Carter . The History Channel did their own investigation and found many errors in the documentary and made an apology and would not broadcast it again . Do n't buy this dvd ! !	-1
`` The Men Who Killed Kennedy '' is an interesting series , but in all candor I 'd say 95 % of it is fiction , just like Oliver Stone 's movie `` JFK . '' It 's basically a showcase for pro-conspiracy beliefs , many of which are truly ridiculous . If you believe Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin you are going to be frustrated and annoyed by this program because that side of the story is almost completely ignored .	-1
I do n't get paid for my reviews . When I write one I am moved to do so . In this case , I support James Aux.. Product details : C-3 , Animated , Closed-captioned , Color , DTS Surround Sound , Dubbed , NTSC , Subtitled , Widescreen . That is WRONG . Misrepresented . It is not Wide Screen . And I do n't know anything about `` Disneyview '' but I will look into that and see how that affects the experience . When it 's not something , it should not state otherwise . Just keep your OLD copies and forget this new package ! ! !	-1
typically , whether i like to admit it or not , i enjoy the older disney animated features . this film is definitely an exception to the rule . the first 15-20 minutes are primarily devoted to the mice . 5 minutes of this would 've been more than enough . in fact , the mice pretty much dominated most of the action in this cartoon . cinderella is an absolute pushover , her character is silly and flat.the film does however follow the story closely : the fairy godmother , the wicked stepmother , the glass slipper . this does not save the film , and halfway through i found myself enduring it just to see it through .	-1
There are highs and lows to almost all Disney fare , especially more recent ones . The early days of Disney animation as easier to forgive because of the general majesty that came from the grand depictions of these fairy tales . More recent entries in the Disney archives to feel more stilted and generic than they used to . They are n't as sinister as some of the early films ( ` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ' is still rather chilling today ) and yet they almost lack any real bite to the point where they can become somewhat predictably boring . ` Tangled ' was a refreshing rebirth so-to-speak ; but can they really follow that up ? I 'm still wondering.So that leaves us with ` Pocahontas ' , the 1995 retelling of the European settlers ' first meeting with the Indians . First of all , historically this is rather ignorant and it should not be used to help young ones understand the truth about our founding fathers . This is given the glossy treatment most Disney movies are given and treated more like a Shakespeare play than anything else . John Smith is Romeo , obviously , and Pocahontas is Juliet . Sadly , Disney does n't understand how to change things up . Pocahontas does n't feel like her own character . She is n't any different than Ariel or Mulan or whoever else you want to name out of the Disney Princess archive . She is a free spirit who has a formulistic father and a dead mother . She follows her heart to a man or a path or a whatever that is against all logic and proves to be wiser than everyone else and thus there is that ` ah-ha ' moment and everyone realizes they should have listened to her all along.Bah.The singing , outside of that ` Colors in the Wind ' song is rather atrocious . The actors here just ca n't sing . The color palate for the film is a tad drab and does n't have the usual grandeur that we have grown accustom to with Disney films . Sure , those two little creatures ( I 'm referring to the dog and the raccoon ) are cute , but they are n't the stars of the this movie ; and quite frankly , Pocahontas and John Smith make a boring couple .	-1
We rank this 34 out of 41 Disney animated movies that we own . The most interesting thing about this movie and the smartest character was the sentient willow tree . According to Amazon Sales Rank only 13 of the 41 movies rank higher than Pocahontas and 28 lower . Our family clearly liked this movie less than most . We felt it was a below average effort by Disney except for the artwork and inking .	-1
Now just listen to me here . Imagine the disney movie life as pryimid . First we had Beauty and the Beast , then we had Aladdin , then the Lion King shot the Disney movie quality to the top of the pyrmid . Then came Pocahontas.And Disney took a nose dive.Making the classic tale of Pocahontas into a movie may have sounded like a good idea . But with all the crazy historical innacuricies you need to wonder what story it was actually based on . I 'm sure by now you all know what really happened in the end . And John Smith 's version of the tale was an exageration from the beginning ( I have a friend that 's related to our herione I know ! ) I do give it 2 stars for the music though , that was pretty good .	-1
Even when not compared to it 's far superior predecessor , & quot ; The Lion King II : Simba 's Pride & quot ; falls flat in every way . The songs were terribly annoying and pointless , the animation was some of the worst I 've seen from the modern Disney . Gone were the bright and beautiful mix of colors present in & quot ; The Lion King , & quot ; we were instead served with cheap looking darkened artistry . Disney makes many great films , but even more terrible sequels ... this is certainly one of them .	-1
The Lion King was a great classic that came with a A List of stars followed by a traffic sound track . In contrast , the Lion King II became a terrible recreation where little effort was done to make this movie better than its predecessor . To me , it was obvious that this movie was made to make money instead of investing large sums of money in post production that usually attracts to appeal to good writers and actors . In short , this movie was a flop before they started filming .	-1
Movie is overrated by customers . The movie might of been good back then but compared to the movies now , it is horrible . Lion king has a similar plot and is much much better . I made a mistake buying this film . Now I have to sell it to someone . I am probably spoiled by the great technology of the modern animation films but do n't expect this movie to even compare to the modern animation films now .	-1
LOL Beany , here is one of those films we were talking about in the comment section of my ` Yogi Bear ' review ; the kinds that do n't deserve much explanation . I feel that I need to now that I 've been called out for not in that instance.What can be said though ? I understand that the idea of ` George of the Jungle ' is to be stupid . I get that . I mean , anyone who saw the trailer for the film or was familiar with the original television series would be a fool to expect something more . That being said , it does n't give it a free pass from being criticized for offering nothing of substantial value . I love my kids and I let them watch what makes them happy , I just prefer to put them in front of a film that not only makes them happy but does n't slowly make them stupid in the process . I just see no value in a film that is too lazy to pull itself out of the mindset that regurgitated pit falls and jokes about animal poop is enough to make a good ` kids movie ' . It 's not . Brendan Fraser is goofy in a way that makes you cringe ( kind of like his career ) and Mann is n't much better ( thank god her career took off in recent years ) . The sad thing is that this could be something smarter and still get the laughs it thinks it is earning . I mean , ` George of the Jungle ' is an obvious spoof on ` Tarzan ' , but when you take to mocking a classic you have to be smart about it . Why do you think so many parody films get torn to shreds by critics ? You have to think it through , and nothing about ` George of the Jungle ' is thought through in a way that creates anything worth noting .	-1
When will Disney ever learn that people could care less about Pan and Scan any more and that Widscreen editions are outselling 4:3 ratio by large margins . They could have at least provided both versions on one DVD . Top marks for this campy movie , zero stars for Disney .	-1
ERROR WOULD N'T LET ME FINISH MOVIE . DO N'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED . BUT I STILL WAS CHARGED . I DON UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS CHARGED	-1
I love the first film , but once again Disney feels the need to desecrate another classic . This film is n't bad because no effort was put into it , but rather it seems to have been made with contempt for the viewer . Did we do something to piss off Disney and that 's why we get these bad sequels ? Is it because we made a non-Disney animated film ; Anastasia a box office success ? While this is not the worst Disney sequel ( There are much worse films ) , it 's still a really bad film . Whatever the reason be for hating us viewers ( Even though we pay good money to see your films ) , here 's my opinion for why you need to stay away from this sorry excuse of a film.WHAT IT 'S ABOUT : The films starts off with what seems to be John Smith getting killed , and then the king of England sends John Rolfe to Jamestown to find Pocahontas and bring her to England to try and convince the king not to attack her people . So after she is retrieved , she along with her animal friends Meeko the raccoon , Flint the hummingbird , and Percy the dog as well as a guard from her tribe , sail off to England . It 's there where she stays with John Rolfe and learns the ways of the English to save her people . But the villain from the first film has returned and keeps lying to the king so he can get an armada to attack her tribe and look for gold again . So Pocahontas must try and save her people before it 's too late.MUSIC : I miss the composer and songwriter from the first film so much . Their replacements are terrible . In fact , the singing scenes are at times so awful I felt sick to my stomach . The musical score by itself is boring and does nothing to make up for the awful singing scenes . There is not one good singing scene , which is really bad considering even the worst of animated sequels have at least maybe one or two good musical scenes . But alas , none are to be found . This area is the polar opposite of its predecessor . The first film had flawless music that gave me goosebumps , while this film had music that made me want to vomit from its awfulness.ACTING : While some of the voice actors from the original return , even they do n't care because they know this film sucks . All of the acting is bad , and pretty suggests that nobody gave a damn about this project and were only there for an extra paycheck while contemplating if they will ever get a respectable role in a film again . Once again , the polar opposite of the first film 's fantastic performances.ACTION : This film is also deadly dull . The first film was a vibrant and exciting love story , while this one is a musical nightmare . The relationship between Pocahontas and John Rolfe is completely devoid of the emotional integrity and livelihood of Pocahontas and John Smith . With this relationship , you just do n't care at all . However , that 's not to say this film is completely devoid of interesting moments . There are a few amusing moments and there were some good fight scenes , but that 's about it.OVERALL : If you are familiar with any straight-to-video Disney sequels , then you know the drill . Avoid at all costs , because it does n't hold a candle to its fantastic predecessor in any way . It 's just another bad sequel that will only entertain small children and completely alienate fans of the original . This film will be forever condemned to bargain bins , where it rightfully belongs.THE GOOD : There are a few amusing comedic moments and a few interesting fight scenes.THE BAD : Terrible story , terrible music , bad acting , and it 's boring .	-1
I was disappointed with this movie . The first movie was so good and the music was excellent . The saying , `` some things are better left unsaid , '' is true with this sequel . I think by creating this sequel , it ruined the magic of the first movie . I felt I was better off not knowing what happened after the first movie . This movie was just a waste of the $ 2 I spent renting it . I love Disney movies but I do n't think they should keep coming out with sequels if they are going to be this bad . I do n't understand what happened to John Smith ! ! ! ! They forced a new romance with the other John that just made the movie uncomfortable . I also felt like the entire movie made Pocahontas look bad . She was portrayed as a savage , dumb , and a bit flighty . Do n't get this movie . Rent it if you absolutely must see it .	-1
It 's is fine movie but the production quality is so bad , I do n't like the story . The original was way better . Do not buy this movie	-1
He history in this follow-up is cleverly written . But the trouble is when Pocahontas sings ( what happens all the time ! ) : it breaks the action completely , it seems more like Mariah Carey screaming , it 's a total waste of the plot .	-1
Pretty disappointing dvd . Our family sat down together to watch this very anticipated film . Very s l o w movie . We all fell asleep to it .	-1
I purchased this because I liked Trouble with Angels and Pollyanna , the Chalk Garden and even Parent Trap . I had never heard of this movie and in a moment of nostalgia decided to purchase it based on its high reviews . This movie was clearly a vehicle meant to capitalize on Mill 's popularity in better more deserving movies , but in itself it is just awful . The story makes no sense and has no real resolution . The singing is abysmal and made me wince . Every Disney hackneyed device was thrown into this movie , and that and a bad script pulled it down . I 'm sorry I believed the reviews . Hayley Mills was a wonderful child actress , but nothing could save this vehicle . If you like the worst of Disney cheese , you 'll love this . Otherwise steer clear .	-1
Ralph Fiennes is one of my favorite actors . Juliette Binoche is one of my favorite actresses . I really enjoyed Ondaatje 's novel . Why then , is this movie so dull ? Perhaps it suffers from trying to stick too closely to the half of the novel it tries to depict . Perhaps there is just a lack of chemistry between the actors ( Defoe in particular lacks a necessary dangerousness ) . I do n't know . I just know that I do not care for this movie . I suggest that you read the novel instead . Do n't write off Ondaatje 's work just because of this lifeless ( though critically acclaimed ) motion picture .	-1
The English Patient [ Blu-ray ] the scenery and the old planes I liked.Critically acclaimed and all that.Good performance.Storyline : Fiennes trades maps that will kill many for Rockefeller gasoline and a German plane to save the adulteress.Hmm .	-1
This is bad on so many levels it 's hard to know where to start . I think the most fundamental problem is that you do n't feel any empathy to the main characters so you do n't really care about what they 're doing . This makes the movie seem like it 's dragging on forever , whereas it 's only 2 3/4 hours . ( Ok , so it does drag on forever ) . I 'm a lover of drama and am sick of the current movie trend of eye candy at the expense of plot , characterization , etc. , but there are so many better movies out there that I would n't even rent this one unless you just need a way to waste 3 hours .	-1
I give up . Disney DVD releases several titles on DVD this week , some in widescreen format with crisp , beautiful new transfers , while dumping others on us in bowdlerized full-screen prints . Unfortunately , the one title I most wanted , 1976 's & quot ; No Deposit , No Return , & quot ; belongs to the latter category . As a result , Disney DVD lost a sale . No widescreen = no sale , no matter how much I want the film . Period.For undiscriminating types who do n't care if they 're ripped-off or not , & quot ; No Deposit , No Return & quot ; is a typical '70's-era Disney trifle with a great cast of veterans ( David Niven , Darren McGavin , Don Knotts , Barbara Feldon , Herschel Bernardi , Charles Martin Smith and Vic Tayback ) pulling out all the stops to enliven a mediocre script that , incidentally , contains one of the biggest plot holes I 've ever seen in a Disney movie ( back to this later ) . Fortunately , director Norman Tokar ( a Disney regular ) and the screenwriters throw everything in but the kitchen sink to create a freewheeling comedy that has more than its fair share of laughs . So even though & quot ; No Deposit ... & quot ; pales in comparison to great Disney laugh-fests like & quot ; The Love Bug & quot ; and & quot ; The World 's Greatest Athlete , & quot ; it is still entertaining and will hold the kids ' interest for all of its 112 minutes.How 's this for a contrived plot ? Jay and Tracy Osborne ( Brad Savage and Kim Richards ) are poor little rich kids who attend a typically Disneyesque boarding school while their magazine editor mother ( Feldon ) globe-trots on business . Excited that they will be spending Easter vacation with her , they are crushed when Mom cancels and whisks the pair off ( along with their pet skunk ( ! ) Duster ) to Los Angeles to spend the week with their despised Grandfather Osborne ( Niven ) , who likes them about as much as they like him ( meaning , not at all ) . At the same time , Duke ( McGavin ) and Bert ( Knotts ) , a couple of luckless but kindhearted safecrackers , are trying to crack the safe at L.A. International Airport , but botch the job and set off the alarm . Meanwhile , Duster gets loose and causes pandemonium in the airport . In the confusion , Jay , Tracy , Duster , Duke and Bert end up in the same taxi , tailed by Grandfather Osborne in his limo . When Jay and Tracy figure out that Duke and Bert are harmless crooks , they con them into thinking they 're homeless and letting them spend the night . The kids then work up a bogus kidnapping scheme and mail a ransom note to Grandfather Osborne ( who has his butler keeping an eye on them from across the street ) and con Duke and Bert into going along with it , figuring they 'll split the money , and Jay and Tracy will go to Hong Kong to join their mother while Duke and Bert pay off the menacing loan shark ( Tayback ) they 're in debt to ( which is why they tried cracking the safe in the first place ) . Whew ! What follows is & quot ; Ransom of Red Chief & quot ; territory , with Osborne refusing to pay the ransom and the quartet continually dropping the ransom amount . It is n't until someone tips off the local police ( represented by Bernardi and his by-the-book rookie partner Smith ) that Grandfather Osborne has to start playing the game and making an attempt to get the kids back . What follows is scene-after-scene of typical '70 's era Disney slapstick , including the Disney equivalent of the classic & quot ; Bullitt & quot ; and & quot ; French Connection & quot ; chase scenes ( played for laughs , of course ) , as the entire cast chases each other around half of L.A. and the entire harbor area in a freewheeling slapstick car chase . Of course , everything ends in predictably warmhearted fashion.Actually , were it not for the cast , & quot ; No Deposit , No Return & quot ; would be D.O.A . But Knotts is typically hilarious , McGavin a perfect straight man for Knotts , Bernardi and Smith bicker amusingly and Richards and Savage ( straight off their famous roles in & quot ; Escape to Witch Mountain & quot ; and & quot ; The Apple Dumpling Gang & quot ; ) are cute and professional , unlike some of the other cloying non-actor child stars of the era . As for Niven , he is an absolute delight and plays wonderfully off his sophisticated image to get some genuine laughs . Feldon shows up late and scores points as a mother who leaves a little bit to be desired.As for the production , the opening cartoon-credits sequence and theme music are rather boring compared to the bouncy themes of & quot ; The North Avenue Irregulars & quot ; and the Kurt Russell college comedies . And , like all other Disney films of the era , it plays like a live-action cartoon in which the reality of the era plays no part whatsoever ( Watergate ? Vietnam ? Jimmy who ? ) It 's basically by-the-numbers stuff , though admittedly entertaining.As for the plot hole ? Okay , here goes : If Grandfather Osborne is a millionaire and does n't want the kids around , and Jay and Tracy would rather go to Hong Kong than spend time with him , then why not just ask Grandfather Osborne for the money so they can go to Hong Kong and be with their mother ? If he does n't want to be bothered with them , then why would he say no ? It 's simple : then there would be no movie.I just do n't get it . Lousy titles like & quot ; Cat From Outer Space & quot ; and & quot ; Hot Lead and Cold Feet & quot ; get widescreen treatment , while great films like & quot ; Darby O'Gill & quot ; and & quot ; Follow Me Boys & quot ; languish in full-screen prints . Even & quot ; No Deposit , No Return & quot ; deserves better . So , the verdict : & quot ; No Deposit , No Return & quot ; gets **1/2 while the DVD treatment rates * . As I said before , I give up .	-1
I would have given this a single star ( or none if possible ) except for a few redeeming qualities . Before I rant , I 'll admit that it was n't -all- bad . First , I liked Peter 's voice , it captured his spirit very well . Second , I liked John and Michael , very cute . Third , I liked Nana . That 's all I liked . Okay , first of all , this movie was NOTHING like the story ! The only similarities were the fact that there was a Peter , a Wendy , mermaids , Hook , etc , but none of them seemed to have the same personality as in the book ! Wendy was horribly annoying in the movie , and only slightly so in the book . Tinkerbell was portrayed pretty well in this version ( spiteful and jealous of Wendy ) but they skipped the fact that she mended their differences . In the movie , Peter is a fairly normal type of boy . In the book , he 's wonderful , cocky , strong , and smart . The Lost Boys were just very different in the book . In the movie , they were cartoony , stupid , and slow , unlike the book . I agree that the portrayal of the redman was sort of incorrect in the movie , but it was n't so different in the book . There was respect in both , although I think the visuals were slightly insulting . Hook was also very ugly in the movie , and described as very cold and attractive in the book . Overall , it just insulted me how unlike the book it was . If you loved the book , do n't inch near this movie . If you have n't read it , then proceed to this movie ... at your own risk ! ! !	-1
This took forever to arrive and when it finally did , it did not work on our DVD player . I do not know what part of the world it came from , but I 'll bet this is a pirated version . It was pricey too .	-1
I am sorry to say that the 'new ' version of Peter Pan does not leave out the terribly racist scene depicting Indians as redmen unable to speak in complete sentences , willing to make anyone a member of their tribe and hand out eagle feathers to anyone who comes around . I am surprised this flies now a days , but apparently people are n't bothered by racism when those offended are fewer in numbers . It would be interesting to see what the backlash would be if this were another minority group.If you wish to raise tolerant children , pick another movie .	-1
My daughter really likes this movie but we had to have many reminders that women ARENT & quot ; easy to trick when they are jealous & quot ; and that Native Americans do not act like they do in the movie . I do n't like censorship of any kind but in this day and age I cant just let this movie be seen without a discussion of & quot ; fantasy vs. reality & quot ; .If you want to have this in your collection , by all means do so , it IS a classic story , and in defense of Disney , Barrie was a notorious mysogenist , However , a discussion of stereotypes would be a nice way to offset this sometimes mean-spirited movie .	-1
Robin Williams soaring in the heavens in his cool T-bird is the only thing worthwhile in this remake of the classic & quot ; The Absent-Minded Professor & quot ; . The robot assistant is cute and the dancing flubber shows off the prowess of the special effects technicians , but , as a film , & quot ; Flubber & quot ; insults even the intellect of a three-year-old .	-1
However , I bought this for my 3-year old . We played a Little Mermaid game trial on the Disney Website and my daughter loved doing anything that involved Ariel or Sebastian . I already own the movie on VHS and thought it would be a good idea to get the DVD , especially since it also supposedly contains extras . The extras are totally for adults who are interested in trivia . There is NO game -- not anything that even closely resembles a game . Though there is a section that says `` Games and Activities '' , there are also NO activities . This is a LIE . What 's in the area labeled games and activities is a video feature , a `` virtual ride '' on the Little Mermaid amusement park ride that was apparently planned but never created . There is `` virtually no control '' over this supposed feature . It is in no way a game or activity.The movie is the movie . We like the movie . I 've now purchased two recent Disney releases which are supposed to be restored . I do n't see a difference . I admit , I am not trying hard either . I 'm not a video elitist when it comes to equipment . I 'm an average buyer.I got free lithographs ordering this early from the Disney site , but they had signs of having been handled . The delivery package had no marks , but the lithographs do . There is a small crease in the same spot on all of them.What a disappointment ! I had thoughts that I might have put these in my daughter 's bedroom somewhere , but with this flaw , I do n't know.I do n't think I 'll be fooled by the next Disney package . I have all the Disney full length animations on videotape from `` Snow White '' to `` Beauty and the Beast '' . I have several on DVD . Of these more recent `` restored '' releases , I have two , this and `` Lady and the Tramp '' . I 've been fooled twice . Shame on me .	-1
Old Yeller '' is the heart-wrenching family drama about two brothers , Travis ( Tommy Kirk ) and Arliss Coates ( Kevin Corcoran ) and their faithful golden retriever - Yeller . When the boys ' father , Jim ( Fess Parker ) leaves on an expedition , mother Katie ( Dorothy McGuire ) becomes the head of the household . This is one of Disney 's first attempts at capturing the great outdoors and vitality of the old frontier plains and it is one of their enduring live action masterpieces . Arliss is always getting into trouble - engaging wild bears and skunks and other critter in the brush , only to be saved in the nick of time by Yeller . However , when Yeller contracts rabies it is left up to Travis to do the humane thing and put his best friend out of misery . Upon its initial release the film did phenomenal box office . And there are still those who get a lump in their throats and a tear in their eye when this heartbreaking family drama and coming of age flick is mentioned in mixed company.Unfortunately for DVD-philes , this is n't Disney 's best despite being advertised as part of their new 2-disc `` Vault Disney '' series . In fact , visually it 's not even close to what a film like `` Old Yeller '' truly deserves . For starters , the print used to master this DVD is very softly focused while still managing to be riddled with edge enhancement , aliasing and shimmering of fine details . There 's a lot of pixelization throughout that really breaks up fine detail . Color is poorly balanced , betraying the lushness of many of the outdoor scenes , with greens , in grass and trees shifting color from brownish beige to muddy beige and then back again . Flesh tones are never natural but appear too , too orange . Fine detail is generally lost in the darker scenes . The audio has been remixed to stereo but is very , very strident and forward sounding . At times it 's painful on the ears and really does n't hold in comparison to the fidelity of the period.Disney does gets top marks for their supplemental materials . We get documentaries , isolated scores , vintage advertising and short subjects , a gallery of stills , trailers and television spots and interviews with the surviving cast members . What more could anybody ask for ? A better print of the film , sadly !	-1
After waiting decades to enjoy this film the way I saw it in the movie theater as a child , what does Disney do ? They glibly release the DVD in fullscreen format , even going so far as to list one of the `` Special Features '' on the jacket as `` Fullscreen ( 1.33:1 ) '' . The `` breathtaking Scottish countryside '' mentioned on the box is nearly obscured in the film due to the cropping on all sides.While the image and sound quality are superior to the VHS version , poor Bobby would cry at this fullscreen treatment by Eisner and his cronies . It 's possible that this film was done in fullscreen like Darby O'Gill , but a dislaimer in the box like was done in Darby would be nice .	-1
Be Careful when buying this blue ray , it states its in its old format which is a huge square on your tv ... not like the way its supposed to be shown in cinemascope . buy the old version of the dvd instead ... .the quality transfer is way better and you can pick if you want it in full frame or original cinemascope . trust me !	-1
I will never purchase this video or any film that vilifies cats . I 'm a cat lover and this treatment in the movies of these wonderful animals makes me sick . The people responsible for making this movie had to be cat haters .	-1
This movie was widely applauded when it came out , replete with Oscar Nominations and awards as well . Perhaps I missed something because when I saw this I was expecting something that I did not get . It was n't fifteen minutes before I was asleep ! ! This film is a real snoozer ... .but that 's just my opinion . The only thing good about it is that it cures my insomnia when I have trouble falling asleep !	-1
Are we actually supposed to feel sorry for this obnoxious brat who is the star of this movie ? I am surprised anyone would put up with his attitude for even one day . Will Hunting 's fatal flaw is that he had a traumatic childhood . Poor baby , do you want your pacifier ? And then comes in the annoying , all-knowing , wise guru , Robin Williams , in another usually annoying role ( similar to the one in 'Dead Poet 's Society ) . He thinks he can help Will Hunting , but there are many scenes where they just sit there and nothing happens . Even in the scenes where they do talk , its a bunch of nonsense anyway . To me , the character played by Matt Deamon was really implausable . He seems to be genius in many different areas ; not only is he a math genius , he can read books with stunning speed and accuracy . He can read entire pages just in a manner of seconds . He is also a master psychologist , he can figure out people 's psychological dispositions just by having one converstion with them . He is also a expert historian . Did I mention that his character can levitate in the air ? Oh , I 'm sorry , he ca n't do that . But considering how much of a genius Will Hunting is so many different areas , I 'm surprised the writers did n't put that one the script .	-1
After watching Good Will Hunting , I was struck by two similarities to other works of fiction ( in this case , novels ) that I had previously read : J.D . Salinger 's `` Catcher in the Rye '' , and Stephen King 's `` Rage '' . Unfortunately , I did not enjoy either of those efforts , and did n't take to `` Hunting '' any more pleasantly.For a basic plot summary , this film centers on young Will Hunting ( Matt Damon ) , a mathematical genius ( of savant proportions ) who spends his time mopping floors at a local university before solving a complex equation left on a blackboard and catching the eye of a math professor ( Stellan Skarsgrd ) . However , Will is a troubled young man who lacks motivation , along with a history of violence , and thus is sent to therapist Sean Maguire ( Robin Williams ) , who tries a rather unorthodox approach to salvaging the boy 's unique talents.Although I can see why some people would like this film much more than I ( due to the deep psychological themes ) , I have never been one much for the `` bratty youngster needs a character treatise to understand what he is going through '' type of storytelling . To me , Will Hunting was an arrogant , unmotivated jerk in the beginning of the film , then a whole bunch of psychological terms/scenarios were thrown around , and now suddenly I 'm supposed to believe that everything is okay ? Not quite.To me , the most interesting scenes in this film revolved around Hunting 's potential girlfriend ( played by Minnie Driver ) . I actually felt that her relationship with Will ( and her character altogether ) were the high points of the film , not the `` tense '' client-therapist scenes that were supposed to steal the show.I realize that I am probably in the minority here , but I really ca n't recommend this film to anyone besides those who love to be wowed by psychological scenarios/situations . I found it be pretentious and bloated to be otherwise .	-1
Obviously you want to like ` Holy Man ' . It stars Eddie Murphy , one of Hollywood 's funniest working comedians , and his name alone should warrant honest laughs . Sadly ` Holy Man ' fails to deliver the goods on just about every level.I remember laughing out loud once when I saw this movie in the theater , and when I watched this debacle again the other night that outward expression of enjoyment was turned inward and remained one of those thoughts , you know the ones , the ` oh that was kinda funny ' thought that never goes anywhere but your mind . ` Holy Man ' could have been a brilliantly crafted satire but instead it becomes a joke , but not the funny kind ; more like a painfully unfunny joke that leaves the audience uncomfortably frustrated.So ` Holy Man ' stars Murphy as G , a religious eccentric who is making his way to his pilgrimage when he is traumatized by Ricky Hayman who accidentally almost runs G over . Feeling somewhat guilty , and feeling pressure from his would-be girlfriend Kate , Ricky offers G his home until he is well enough to continue his journey . The kicker is that Ricky is the producer of a home-shopping network that is dropping in points and his new boss is breathing down his neck to either increase ratings or look for another job . Kate , who happens to be the shows marketer , realizes ( after G makes an unexpected appearance on the show ) that G may be the answer to their prayers . Soon G becomes the new host with the most as his eccentric forms of enlightenment draw in viewers and sell , sell , sell.As far as acting is concerned , Murphy is good but he is not all that funny . He really could have taken G to a whole other level but he kept him lowbrow and somewhat boring . He had a few chuckle worthy scenes but the overall film is so painfully underwhelming you ca n't bring yourself to acknowledge the chuckle . Jeff Goldblum never ceases to annoy me ; well he ceases on occasion but as a rule he is generally the worst part of a specific movie . I give him points for actually staying within my tolerance is this film . His neurotic tendencies seem to be a little more tempered and controlled and thus he becomes a little more accessible and so I give him props there . It 's a shame that he decided to make this the movie he matured in . Kelly Presley is a throwaway character here , serving her purpose of clich & eacute ; d romantic lead and moral compass.Blah , blah , blah.In fact the only actor that kept me interested was Robert Loggia who plays Hayman 's boss McBainbridge ( a stark contrast from his delightful boss in ` Big ' ) . I just like Loggia I think so maybe I was blinded to the clich & eacute ; ridden character he was playing . Oh well , at least he was n't boring.In the end I would pass on this mess if I were you . There are so many better comedies out there , even one 's that star Murphy , that to waste your time and energy trying to find a laugh amidst this poor excuse for commercial success is just a crime against your better judgment . I should have let me memory of disappointment guide me far away from ever watching this film again . Next time ; well , hopefully there wo n't be a next time .	-1
I made the assumption that Eddie Murphys films are bound to be funny and worth watching . This film proved me wrong .	-1
This movie is just terrible . Holy Man tries to juggle all aspects of emotions but drops the ball . It 's not funny , it 's not romantic , it 's not warm , and it 's especially not worth your time .	-1
Well meaning and a few funny moments by Jeff Goldblum get this more than one star but the cheesy formula plot and story just do not work . Eddie Murphy is great but this role here just does n't do him justice . I wanted to like it and kept thinking it might get better but it just got worse .	-1
I 'm looking at reviews and people are saying , `` The movie is awful ! Read the book . '' It 's true that the movie is one of the worse films you will ever see , butI advise you NOT to read the book . It 's too difficult to read and it leaves you with a headache . If you 're in school and you 're required to read this book , I suggest you just watch the movie ( get the 2 hours and 52 minutes out the way ) and get Cliff Notes . For real , do n't watch the movie or read the book unless you have no choice .	-1
Tell me what you think of this plot : A child comes back to life to confront the mother who cut her throat , only she is a grown woman , but still talks like a child . Meanwhile this so-called ghost manages to seduce her mother 's `` boyfriend '' who has come back after 18 years . The ghost manages to get pregnant by him . Then the `` ghost '' , totally naked and pregnant is brought out on the front porch by her mother and disappears in a couple of minutes when a group of church ladies start chanting and singing spiritual songs from the road in front of the house . Then the mother goes into depression for having lost the child that has come back to her and her other daughter goes to work for rich white folks to support herself and her mother . That 's Beloved in a nutshell . And let 's not forget another ghost that you do n't see at all ; just her poltergeist activity , except you do see that ghost in the flesh near the end of the movie ( and in flashbacks to a prior time ) . And people think this is a great movie ? It 's a very strange movie and I could n't tell what the message was supposed to be , if there even was one . The one redeeming thing about the movie is the period costumes and scenery , which is very beautifully done . It takes place in the 1800 's and you certainly do feel that you have been taken back in time .	-1
This was the worst movie I have ever seen . I can tolerate bad movies . It takes a lot for me to pan a film but this was bad . I admit that I did n't read the book and I am sure there was a good intention to bring across the message in the book but it just does n't work . Nothing made any sense .	-1
Everything is fine . You 're sitting there feeling good that a `` decent '' movie could be so well made . You are not prepared for the ending which just had to break down into x-rated pornography . I mean it could n't even be two people naked and we get the clue . It had to be graphic.What a loser !	-1
This movie was a cross between Austin Powers ( opening credits ) and The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( costumes ) . The film takes place during the upcoming of London 's glam-rock movement in the early 70 's ( right after flower power and before the punk rock , new wave scene ) .However , I was glad they included music by Roxy Music . During the glam-rock era it was well known artists like Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music along with David Bowie ( Ziggy Stardust ) who fronted the early 70 's with this type of music.Though the characters and bands were fictitious in Velvet Goldmine , it was for this nostalgic value that I rented the dvd as well as for Ewan McGregor 's excellent acting.After seeing McGregor as a doped-up exhibitionist-rock star , it made me wonder if I was not looking at his character from Trainspotting . The storyline was difficult to follow . By the time you try to figure out who 's doing what and to whom , who cares ... Anybody who plans to show this in front of grandma or anybody with a weak heart better think twice ; there 's all kinds of nudity ( especially frontal ) , substance abuse , raunchy rock stage performances , etc . Anybody who thought Prince was raunchy in his Purple Rain heyday needs to take a look at this flick . The film had a very promising story line to tell , yet got muddled or lost . As for seeing it again and again to understand more or discover new information , I do n't think so ...	-1
I have a quest . I 'm a huge fan of Ewan McGregor , so I want to see all of his movies . I was pretty excited to see Velvet Goldmine because I heard it was good . Sadly , I was misinformed . Maybe it 's because I 'm not into glam rock or something , but nothing about this movie really did it for me . I thought it was rather dull , actually . I expected McGregor , as the top-billed actor , to have a larger role , and while I did see a lot of him ( all of him , in fact ... wink , wink ) , I wanted to know more about his character and see more of his performance.In general , I found this movie lacking . There was n't enough plot to keep me interested , and the music was n't good enough to keep it going for me . I thought this movie was rather blah .	-1
As a big fan of both Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Ewan McGregor , I had high expectations for this movie.However , I have seldom spent a more depressing 2 hours watching a film.Nobody is likeable.Star Brian Slade ( a rocker portrayed by hot new Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) is given very little to do except prance about in makeup that makes him look variously like a space alien , the Grinch that Stole Christmas and a refugee from the thrift store.Slade is supposedly instantly charismatic , a trait that often opens doors for him . Yet it is hard to understand how anyone would be drawn to his shallow , manipulating , self-centered character . He has n't a single redeemable feature except for a striking physical beauty , which is n't enough to carry the movie.Ewan McGregor as a washed-up rocker who gets a career rescue from Slade as his drug and alchohol problems peak , pretty much steals the movie , but his character 's motivations are mysterious - and remain so througout.The motivations and inner workings of the people involved are never really explored except through glib cliches.The movie makes the mistake of believing its audience already is invested with awe , nostalgia and reverence for the whole glam rock phenomenon , which many of us missed the first time around.Although its reference to gay issues is woven through the entire movie , it does n't have the courage to openly focus the movie as a & quot ; coming out/coming of age & quot ; movie about what it was like to discover - for the first time - that a pop cultural phenomenon was aimed at a gay and bi audience.That might have been an interesting , uplighting movie.Velvet Goldmine most certainly wasn't.Lady Fushia	-1
I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie I was fairly certain that it would be based a bit on Bowie ( Velvet Goldmine is the title of a very glam-y Bowie song after all ) and possibly Roxy Music . I caught a glimpse of the CD track listing and was a little shocked to find it contained virtually all Roxy Music and one old T-Rex track . Well ok , on with the show I mean Roxy Music was part of the glam scene so so I figured they would weave that in somehow.I can not even tell you how utterly dissapointed I was with this film . It is one of the most contrived things I have ever seen . I will admit that the costumes were certainly glam-y and the overall feeling was certainly early 70 's decadence but could they have over blown the Bowie and Iggy Pop characters any more ? ( That 's rhetorical of course ) . It was so blatant , complete with the annoying American wife who tried to control his career ( can you say Angie ? ) . Next up was the band itslef & quot ; Venus on Furs & quot ; , or some such nonsense ( umm Spiders from Mars ? ) . The whole & quot ; killing off the character thing ( Aladdin Sane , abruptly stopped and out comes the Thin White Duke , for further info . consult & quot ; Bowie Live at the Tower Philidelphia & quot ; ) . They could have made it ever so much more interesting because in reality , it was ... incredibly more entertaining . If you are going to rip of someone 's life , at least try get it right for cryin out loud . Ewan did do a mighty fine Iggy Pop impersonation complete with the writhing and alcohol induced antics and that is what kept me from throwing this DVD across the room . Eddie Izzard , whom I adore normally , was well , less than stellar , but then again look what he had to work with.Probably this film will do well among the very , very young ( under 25 ) who have no clue what , who , when , how and why glam was started . These poor kids probably know Bowie from Let 's Dance , never heard of Iggy Pop or Roxy Music and think that T-Rex is a dinosaur ... .literally . No wonder they could n't license any old Bowie or for that matter Sweet for this film . Since Bowie had nothing to do with this project from hell , I figure it completely redeems him from his & quot ; China Girl & quot ; / & quot ; Modern Love & quot ; fog bank.If you have ANY knowledge whatsoever about Glam ... do n't watch this , it will only make you angry as all hell .	-1
This film is a real stinker . No picture could be as bad as this horrid movie . Adam Sandler stars as a jibbering [ simpleton ] ( again ? ! ) who has a job as waterboy for the local football team . He gets angry and delivers a bone crunching tag on a player which gets him a place on the football team . Now , do n't get me wrong . I like Adam Sandler . I really do . But , this is just too awful . The funny voices he always does get old in the first 2 minutes . A whole movie of it is unbearable ! . It 's also sad to see a great actress like Kathy Bates in this . What was she thinking ? . Same with Henry Winkler . Fonz , this is n't cool ! . Fairuza Balk , as the love interest , is shrill and unappealing . So is this whole movie . A waste of money , time , and talent . Folks , it does n't get any more sickening than The Waterboy . If you like Sandler , I recommend `` The Wedding Singer '' , `` Big Daddy '' , and `` Happy Gilmore '' . Not that those are classics , but they are fifty times better .	-1
one of the worst movies and DVD 's made . Skip it	-1
I 'm a big fan of Adam Sandler 's but man , did this movie ever suck ! It 's garbage ! ... ... there 's nothing good about it . It 's Sandler 's worst attempt at a comedy . And why is the Fonz in there ?	-1
I watched this movie with a bunch of friends expecting it to be of a similar quality to the original - how wrong we were ! This movie was dire , the & quot ; Plot & quot ; , if thats what you want to call it looked like the actors made it up as they went along , most of the lines sounded & quot ; ad lib & quot ; and the bats looked like they were hanging from pieces of elastic band . The effects were bad even for a B movie , I could go on forever picking this mvie to pieces , but I dont have the time or space to do so , the verall quality looked like something from a low budget tv station . Avoid !	-1
Here 's a few tips I gleaned from watching `` FDTD 2 '' that I think should be born in mind by EVERY aspiring filmmaker:1 . Just because a camera angle or tricky move seems cool at the time does not mean you should actually use it . As soon as I saw the scene in this film shot from a rotating fan 's point of view I knew I was in trouble . Take the time to make sure that camera placement and shot composition actually mean something and add something to the scene . If you ca n't come up with a good bit of justification , please just leave the damn camera alone.2 . When making a sequel it is advisable to actually bring something new to the story . Otherwise you are simply a hack marking time . As Joe Bob Briggs once said in regard to the first three `` Friday the Thirteenth '' films , `` They made the same movie three times . '' `` FDTD 2 '' played like a direct-to-video knock-off of the original . The plot was virtually the same with its gang of hoods running headlong into some real evil and getting caught with their pants down . Here 's hoping the third entry in the series actually has something new to say.3 . Robert Patrick can not carry a whole film by himself . I realize this is sure to fly in the face of every X-File-iac and James Cameron obsessed fan on the planet , but the man is a younger poorer man 's version of Lance Henricksen and nothing more . Here his acting his negligible , his charm nonexistent and his part poorly written . Doomed from the start if you ask me.4 . In conclusion let me just say that if you intend to make a horror film you really do owe it to your audience to give them a few thrills along the way . This does not necessarily equate to dumping bucket after bucket of fluids and offal all over the characters . Rather , it means building an atmosphere of genuine tension and dread and setting the story 's machinations a flying . If need be , watch `` Texas Chainsaw '' , `` Phantasm '' , `` Dawn of the Dead '' and the original cut of `` The Exorcist '' until it starts to sink in .	-1
julia roberts plays a lady of the night who is given pity by a rich man and they end up shacking up.every julia roberts movie sucks.dont let your kids watch this filth.making a hooker out to be a good person is pathetic.she asks for 20 mill a movie now.i wouldnt pay her 1 penny to stand in front of an oncoming truck.thank your lucky stars theres no sequel.i dont see what the big deal is.a love story about a dirty woman who knows nothing about love only smut ? come on ! thats hardly belivable.i think shes a pathetic actress and she could make my top 100 babe list if i ran out of entrants around # 98 or 99.shes annoying.i guess thats why its on the movies because its a fantasy not reality .	-1
Perhaps , it 's not at all fair that I review this movie , so forgive me . It 's the only negative review I 've posted , and it 's not something in which I 'd have the slightest interest , and I do n't care for Julia Roberts . I was 'roped ' into watching this film on cable with a friend several years ago . Within several minutes , I could accurately guess the shallow plot which could be summed up as : ignoramous/tramp with a phoney Jersey ( ? ) accent moves to Hollywood and meets pimp ( Richard Gere . ) Big surprise -- they hit it off . Big surprise -- he has feelings for her but she does n't . Big surprise -- she changes her mind and wants him . Big surprise -- she changes her mind again and does n't want him . Huge surprise -- she changes her mind again and off they go into the proverbial sunset . Hopefully , Gere sent her to school to learn to read and write , at least , though that 's irrelevant in her `` profession . `` I had to get away from this thing more and more as it went on , by taking an unprecedented amount of smoke breaks outside ( and just sitting outside for awhile , for that matter . ) By the time of one of the sex scenes -- I think on top of a piano -- he removes her little slip the size of a handkerchief . That was it . I stayed outside until it was over.But I did learn one thing . The next time someone ropes me into something I dread , I 'm gon na say `` Gee whiz , guess what ? I just saw it on TV or VHS or DVD last week . '' That will get me off the hook and out of this kind of situation again . I guess I could have been blunt and told my friend a minute into the film that I could n't withstand it.I 'm not trying to be mean , but this kind of junk just does n't do a thing for me -- give me some quality films from the 50s & 60s ( see my relatively few reviews . ) Hope no one takes offense .	-1
Who could possibly like a movie whose lesson is : & quot ; happiness is having some guy give you free access to his credit cards & quot ; ? Everyone complains about the lack of family values on TV , but what message could be worse than & quot ; shopping is happiness , and love is having someone pay you to be with them & quot ; ? yuck	-1
Blu-ray discs do not have the same country-region issues that normal dvds have . It 's more a question of TV system . I live in Japan , and since the U.S. and Japan TV systems are the same , I can theoretically watch American blu-ray discs in Japan . I bought the U.S. version of Sleeping Beauty , and it played beautifully on my player here in Japan . My only regret is that the Disney `` restoration '' team managed in screwing up the color scheme of the film for viewers in all countries ! Snow White was released on Blu-ray a little bit prior to Japan . I could n't wait to see it , so I got one from the U.S. and put it in my Japanese player . But this time , a screen popped up telling me that certain portions would not be accessible in some territories . The menu came on . I chose `` Watch the film '' with normal view . The screen went black and stayed that way . Then I tried `` special features '' . Same thing . I only attempted these two items . Both did n't work . Disc 2 played wonderfully.So I thought , `` Well -- I guess I 'll have to buy the Japanese version , since I 'm living here . '' To my shock , the items I failed to open in the American disc are now not accessible in the Japanese disc either . It is as if the machine remembers what happened before , and is perpetuating the problem . And so , my friends , in order to see Snow White in Blu-ray , the only avenue open is to buy another player , one that has n't been tainted with this `` bug '' . What I did n't try to access before was the movie with `` Disney View '' . It works , but I find the ever-changing paintings on both sides of the screen very distracting ! ( Well-painted , but distracting . ) Walt Disney 's sole motivation was to make sure the paying public got the maximum of entertainment value from his great works . It seems that the folks at Disney nowadays have an unnatural obsession with micro-managing things so that they control every little thing buyers of their discs get to see or do n't get to see . The changed colors in the Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray are an annoying example.I bought the 70th anniversay Blu-ray edition ( U.S. ) of The Wizard of Oz . Both discs play on my Japanese player like a dream ! THIS IS WHAT BLU-RAY WAS MEANT TO DO.For their wonderful Blu-ray presentation , I give MGM an A+ . For their trouble-producing bug-infested Blu-ray disc of Snow White , Disney gets a D- .	-1

Although I am old enough for not going ga-ga over animated movies , I still enjoy them , I liked Ice Age a lot , Shrek was wonderful , Monsters , Inc was also of my liking , but this lame pice of garbage was terrible . First of all , I think the film was a terrible example for children , why , oh let me think , the two main characters were a pair of good for nothing creatures , Lilo was a spoiled brat who did anything she wanted and here shield was that her parents were dead , come on , so if a kids parents die that means the kid is free to do as she wants and get what she wants , she was a destructive and stupid girl that thought she was so cool just for liking Elvis , so , not that I hate Elvis , he Is the King of Country , which I enjoy , but that was a very lame addition to this already wreck of a film . And the second character , Stitch was a destructive and vicious animal that looked like he had some sort of disease , I still think he should be put down by a vet or something . This characters are `` wonderful '' role-models for children right . In a time when children are growing more and more dumb and spoiled , do we really need to encourage it even more . I think Disney has lost all of its once wonderful quality , Disney was so desperate of getting people to like this movie so they put in the trailer all of the GOOD movies of the past like The Lion King ( the best animated of all time ) and Beauty and the Beast ( the second ) and made it look like if Lilo & Stitch was a spoof , thats why I went to see it , then I saw it , and I went out feeling angry because I spend almost two hours of my life seeing this `` movie '' . Everything in it was awful , the story , the characters , the lame and stupid lines and etc . This `` film '' made it look to kids that the best and only way to be was to be like Lilo & Stitch , my little cousin tried to adopt the style of living of thoose two stupid characters , Disney must remember that children get very infuenced by tv and films and if they imitate the behaviour they see , I have seen it happen many times , and do you parents think is correct to condone indicipline , destructiveness and all of the things that were gloryfied in Lilo & Stitch , you may find it amussing , but kids will make it their way of life . If this film wins best animated movie in the Oscars I will really be upset and do n't see more of the awards because any person or group of people that condone honour this film do n't know anything about movies , I do , I have studied filmaking , and have watched many films , I 'm no master , but I know a little , and that is enough to see that this is junk , worst than junk but I cant curse here , so please , See Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron rather than this , because I think that Lilo & Stitch shows most of the many things that are wrong with the world and encourages these mischiefs .	-1
I was shocked at the way the Lilo character was dipicted in this sickening film from Disney.First off , Lilo brutally beats a little girl mercilessly simply because she disagrees with her.Then , her older sister jay-walks then kicks a car and throws an insult at the driver for no reason.Next , we see Lilo living in a house of pure filth and her older sister leaves the stove on while she 's not at home . It saddened me to see Lilo 's older sister threaten violence against Lilo and then Lilo responds with horrid insults against her sister.This is a very disturbing image of what Disney calls `` an alternative family '' . This film has absolutely no redeeming value can not teach your child anything about life that he or she could n't already learn from the gutter ...	-1
I 'm absolutely stunned at the rave reviews this absurdity has recieved . This movie was comedic where it tried to be serious , it was inexplicable when it should have been realistic , and it was above all irritating to watch . Everyone I was with came to that same consensus . And do n't think I 'm some thirty-five-year-old uncultured religious fundamentalist whining about violence and sex in movies . I 'm a fifteen-year-old guy who went to the movie with other fifteen and sixteen year old guys.First , the good . If all you care about in a movie is hot women , you 've got it covered . The style that the movie was shot in was also quite entertaining . It was certainly a feast for the eyes , which makes me wonder if the critics are that easily swayed by a new idea to give a movie a shining review . If it were n't for the splashes of brilliant color in between all the grey , would the critics have thought it was such a great , groundbreaking movie ? No . They would have said it was inexplicable and humorous , such as I . Now let me move on to the truly awful : Can someone please explain to me why after the main character in the middle segment got ran over by a car twice , shot with a gun over and over and over again , and punched out , he can still get back up and walk around shooting people . No , not just shooting people-killing them instantly with one shot ! Does anyone else see the inconsistency here ? Also , was it truly necessary to have an incapacitated head start speaking in the middle of a serious action sequence ? Was that meant to be a joke ? I could n't tell.Furthermore , is n't the `` hookers run this city and have a pact with the police '' thing a little cliche and played out ? Also , the pulling off of penises made me want to gag.The acting was horrendous , but what else should you expect from Brittany Murphy , Taryn Manning and Jessica Alba ? Even Bruce Willis , a favorite of mine , disappointed ( For a good new Bruce flick , catch `` Hostage '' ) .Without it 's stylized directing and visuals , it would be dubbed a piece of crap by the critics and by audiences alike.But , you could still go for a good laugh , I guess.Grade : D-Cliche-filled cheese .	-1
This is exactly what you 'd expect from folks with past succes whose heads get a little too big . There is virtually no dialogue in this film . The whole movie , from start to finish is narrated . It 's like the directors are playing `` dollies '' with the actors . Or as if they do n't trust the actors to convey the stories correctly or the viewer to understand , so they 're going to tell you exactly what the story is . Ho , hum . And I do n't care how much violence there is in this film , because there is an overabundance they could do less with , it is still a ho-hummer . The movie is apparently a chain of `` pulp fiction '' stories , most of them having nothing to do with anything or each other , other than to stretch the movie out so it wo n't be a short film . I 'm guessing Tarantino 's attempt to remake the Switchblade Sisters fails miserably and unconvincingly . I do n't think the Switchblade Sisters would return as a gang of prostitutes.Skip this movie and read a comic book instead . At least you 'll have fun figuring out the comic book 's story than being narrated by a boring movie with truly sickening characters .	-1
WAIT for the SE ! If you are not a DVD collector , and do n't care about double-disc sets and extras , then go right ahead . Otherwise , this is a bare-bones ploy to get your $ $ $ . ( BTW - movie is 5 stars . )	-1
This movie was simply too boring and stuoid to keep watching . It 's basically a darker version of Dick Tracey.Skip this one unless you like the comic books .	-1
This review refers to the earlier single-disc edition that was released back in August . As much as I am lauding the special edition that is released a mere few months later , I abhorred the way Disney/Miramax treat their clients and customers with such contempt . Do they hate the consumers so much that they expect all of us to double dip each of their title that is released ? Luckily , when I purchased this single disc edition , it was at a huge discount from Amazon , if not , I would n't have bothered even casting a glance at its cover .	-1
Movie is a little annoying , and is overkill as far the violence is concerned , pretty graphic , Rosario dawson is super hot , other than that , there is no incentive to watch , I felt like I was being dragged to through another Quentin Taratino-ish flick .	-1
Maybe I missed something by not seeing this in the theater ; maybe the living comic book visual style of SIN CITY was so dazzling on a big screen that it obliterated any reservations about the sheer banality of its storylines . But I finally got a chance to see this film , a joint effort of graphic novelist Frank Miller and film director Robert Rodriguez , and was frankly bored by it after about half an hour ( and I think I 'm being generous there ! ) . All the storylines -- -Bruce Willis ' attempt to protect a young stripper ( Jessica Alba ) , Mickey Rourke 's attempt to avenge a prostitute 's ( Jaime King ) death , Clive Owen 's attempt to put down a thug ( Benicio del Toro ) and his misogynistic ways -- -are done in a film noir style that is unfortunately ALL style . There 's no psychological depth to any of the characters as there are in other comic book adaptations ( BATMAN BEGINS is an exemplary recent example ) ; it 's all just a soulless geek show . A fantastic looking , often atmospheric geek show , but a geek show nevertheless . If appearances are all that matter to you , than SIN CITY will probably be a ball ( and the visuals are the only reasons I 'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of just 1 ) . But for those looking for something other than just fancy-pants visuals in a comic book movie adaptation , look elsewhere .	-1
I got the dvd as a gift and with all of these teen movie actors in the film ( Josh Hartnett , Elijah Wood , Brittany Murphy , Alexis Bledel , etc . ) , I was expecting something completely different . I was expecting something light-hearted and silly , but Sin City is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen . There are some amazing visuals , but they 're so shocking and brutal . Lots of nudity , blood , gore , violence . It was too much for me.I guess the storylines are interesting and there 's lots of interlacing and they tie together near the end . Some of the storylines are somewhat trite and not that intriguingIf you 're really into visual violence and fantasy , this is a good movie . But definitely do n't watch it if you 're under 17 or if you ca n't stand the sight of blood .	-1
what a dumb movie , do n't see what the hype is about ? Do n't waste your time !	-1
I wanted to like this film , i really did . But it just reaked of some lame video game storyline all linked together . It is true to the source material but when adapting a comic to another formal you need to adjust it to that format . This has not been done here . In essence you get a moving graphic novel . If this was to be adapted to a novelisation would the source material be used so literally . I think not . This film was all style over substance . Bad story , lame characters , lame action . It gets one star for Rutger Heurs great performace .	-1
The visuals are great but the endless worship of violence is sick and pointless .	-1
Film goir maybe . Frank Miller , author of the source graphic novels , was seduced into green-lighting the movie and settled for something even shallower than his graphic novels . I wish he had boned up on Rodriguez ' previous film history before getting compromised in this first-person-shooter computer-game of a movie . But now that Sin City-1 has paid the bills , maybe the sequel will try to aim a little higher.Pros:1 . Stunning hyper-noir black and white visualsCons:1 . Strict fidelity to the graphic novels - comic book stereotypes masquerading as noir protagonists2 . Non-existant Sin City backstory - no depth at all to the weak screenplay3 . Stylized , but endless and numbing ultra-violence including cannibalism , castration and suicide4 . Acting talent wasted with hip , cliche-dominated dialogue5 . Five-minute Tarantino segment embarassing parody of his neo-noir film work.6 . Way too little content to sustain a 2-hour plus movie.7 . HumorlessConclusion : Boring and irritating waste of potentially exciting noir visuals .	-1
How can anybody take a star-filled line-up and produce a clunker like this one ? Fantasy films , shot in black and white , with a splash of color for effect , went out of fashion before they ever could be fashionable . I 'm a Bruce Willis fan to the nth degree , but this loser almost replaces `` Hudson Hawk '' as the worst film he has ever taken a part in . I thought I had seen all of his movies and was surprised to have discovered this movie . Now I wish I had n't . I 'm not sure if I even want to add this to my Willis collection of DVDs .	-1
The first and most important element of any decent Sci-Fi/Action movie is a good script with strong characterisation , plausible dialogue and a believable motivation behind the lead characters . Without these , the film invariably descends into a campy parody of itself , and that is precisely what 's happened here.It does n't matter how closely this movie sticks to the comics that spawned it - when you move to a different medium you need to make changes to reflect the move ( like the cut-down character backgrounds in the X-Men movies , or the plot tweaking and omission in the Harry Potter series - two extremely successful sci-fi/literary adaptation franchises ) , and sadly , 'Sin City ' seems to think it can get away with having the actors spout the same kinds of dialogue as they do in the comics.This does n't work for several reasons . On the printed page , we need to have things spelled out for us that comic art - particularly the kind of comic art contained in the Sin City books , a hugely graphical and stylised look - ca n't capture . Character subtleties , plot development , emotional states - all of these are things that comics more often than not need to have as printed text , and in the comic book medium , this works . On film , these things - character subtleties , plot development , emotional states - are all possible to achieve with visuals - facial expressions , body language , montage sequences , and so forth . The movie of 'Sin City ' has its first major failing , then , in that the characters - grim and gritty men and women of action and consequence - wax lyrical over themselves , their current situations , and their previous histories - until they end up sounding like pedantic Drama majors about to embark on their first audition . The Valkyrie speech ? The White Light line ? The entire opening monologue ? Three of the most horrendous offenders that are so full of their own self-importance that it makes the rest of the script surrounding them pale into mundanity - which is n't too much of a problem since it was all pretty mundane to begin with.The second problem with 'Sin City ' is the amateurish use of spot colours , here and there , to suggest a tie to the excellent style of the comic books . 'Schindler 's List ' used this ploy to great effect , but sadly , here it just looks overdone . Not that this is a bad idea in theory , but thanks to some pedestrian direction ( particularly in the first and second stories ) it seems to be there just for the sake of it , as opposed to highlighting anything actually important . Case in point : the blue eyes of the young hooker in the second plot are just annoying because there are n't enough worthwhile close-ups of her face to make the colour stand out . It becomes a mere annoyance noticing these small splashes of colour against , it must be said , an overall rather effective visual style of high-contrast black and white areas.Direction is run-of-the-mill action fare.Performances are forced and difficult , particularly the action movie veterans like Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke . It ca n't be much fun having to deal with such clunky dialogue as this . They do their best but sadly , as is the case with the more traditionally artistic actors like Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro , fail to deliver the mawkish , over-the-top lines with anything other than palpable disbelief.Two stars for a brave attempt is all I can award this movie , such a potential wasted and with such a horrible , forced script , it 's lucky to get even that . Pick up the comics instead , they 're far more rewarding and not half as annoying .	-1
Pay attention to the other viewer reviews , positive and negative . They 're telling a pretty consistent story . There is little in the way of `` art '' here . Unfortunately , I was suckered in by the professional reviews . This is violence for violence 's sake . Pretty much period . The acting is wooden , the script is lame , and there 's no message to speak of . But if what you 're looking for is over-the-top violence , this is the movie for you ( and possibly even the `` GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE '' ) . Oh , there are also a plentiful number of scantily clad or partially unclad young , attractive women . And as the other reviews make clear , much of the violence is explicitly within the context of sex ( or the sex business , or as a substitute for sex , or ... ) . Some of it was pretty disturbing . Or it would have been if the visuals were n't done in the spirit of the original comic book rather than real life ( oh , I 'm sorry , `` graphic novel '' ) . Of course , that 's the main drawing point of the movie , the linkage of violence and sex . As repellant as I found this movie to be , they did do a excellent job of sticking to their main point . I found it pretty darn misogynistic really , but it just may be your cup of tea . Of course , the black and white visuals with splashes of color was an interesting approach , but not worth sitting through the movie for . I would like to give this zero stars but the system wo n't let me .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , I really like this movie . While there is n't a great plot , it 's so stylish and beautifuly done it 's hard not to enjoy . But , in what is quickly becoming a tradition in Hollywood , the studio plans on releasing this and then a two-disc special edition several months later . Talk about greed ! If I were you , I 'd wait . If you really love the movie , why not rent it or watch it On Demand in the meantime ?	-1
We stopped watching it after five minutes ; it was that bad . Dialog totally predictable , first scene of murder almost made you want to laugh . If we had viewed this in a theater , we would have walked out and asked for our money back .	-1
the viuals were good , the actors were bad and the story line just blows .	-1
The extended version is only aprox . 15 min . longer than the theatrical version . I noticed that the time for the longer one is omited from the Amazon specs . The only way to tell is by going to the store and look at the small print on each of them . Man the Fellowship of the Ring is enhanced by 30 min . this `` new and improved movie '' just looks like tripple dipping by the studio ! ! What a bunch of felgercarb.This is such a great movie but the studio blew it with this version .	-1
Following the massive success of New Line 's `` Lord of the Rings '' film trilogy , Disney has followed suit with this ambitious adaptation of C. S. Lewis ' epic fantasy series . A grass-roots marketing campaign ( to encourage church group bookings ) has begun in the hopes of potentially tapping the `` Passion of the Christ '' audience along with the hordes of Tolkien and Lewis fans . I did n't have a lot of interest in the books as a child , so I thought the odds were better that I 'd like this version.The film starts off well , hurling us into the London blitz that necessitates the removal of the four Pevensie children ( Peter , Edmund , Susan and Lucy - William Moseley , Skandar Keynes , Anna Popplewell , and Georgie Henley , respectively ) to the countryside . This not only motivates a crucial change in their lives , it delineates their conflicts with one another nicely.Their new home is a glum manor owned by Professor Kirke ( Jim Broadbent ) and run by the dour Mrs. MacReady ( Elizabeth Hawthorne ) . It 's an empty , cold , resolutely adult world , and the Pevensies do their best to stick together and circumvent the many rules of the house . It 's during a cautious game of hide-and-seek that tiny Lucy hides in a massive wardrobe and discovers a portal to another chilly , beautiful realm.Narnia , a fantasyland populated by fauns , centaurs , dwarves , and griffins ( among many other creatures ) has been thrown into a state of `` always winter , never Christmas '' by the White Witch ( a perfectly cast Tilda Swinton ) , an icily regal despot who seduces new followers and turns dissenters to stone . What her magic can not accomplish , her roaming wolf packs will.But change is in the air . The true ruler of Narnia , a mighty lion named Aslan , has returned and his supporters are gathering strength once more . It seems that the children are the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy that four humans will one day reclaim their thrones and restore Narnia to freedom . The White Witch will stop at nothing to keep her power over the land , and the clouds of war begin to cast their shadows . It 's up to the children to lead Narnia to victory and freedom.Until recently , the fantasy stamp was the seal of doom for a movie . The remainder bins at your local video store are stuffed with attempts to court this audience - `` Dragonslayer '' , `` The Sword and the Sorcerer '' , `` Fire and Ice '' , `` Dungeons and Dragons '' , and `` Red Sonja '' , just to name a few . Previous to the `` Rings '' trilogy , the two moderate successes that come to mind might be `` Conan The Barbarian '' and `` Willow '' - neither of which inspire much affection.This genre is fraught with pitfalls , and `` Narnia '' is very much a mixed bag . As in `` The Lion King '' , it 's a little frustrating to watch as an entire world waits passively for The Right One ( s ) to show up and save them all . The plot is a Christian allegory , so viewers come to the film expecting a central death and resurrection at its heart . Unfortunately , giving Lucy as well as Aslan the power to breathe life into the dead weakens the consequences of the overall conflict.Not surpisingly for a Disney picture , the film feels uncomfortable with the responsibilities of life and death in war . Peter 's first slaying of a wolf guard - his emergence as the leader of Aslan 's followers - feels more accident than deliberate choice , letting him off the hook for the kill . While I 'm not a fan of gratuitous gore , the battles in `` The Lord of the Rings '' were in the province of adults - they had the proper impact , a true sense of dread and loss . It 's unsettling , then , in `` Narnia '' to see small children cheerfully become proficient with weapons . The bloodless battles creep uncomfortably close to a massive version of `` Capture the Flag '' . We 're supposed to cheer when soaring griffins dump boulders on the enemy , but it 's precisely what we saw the Germans do to England in the opening . It 's tough to sympathize strongly with one army or another , as mythical creatures and animals substantially populate both sides . Are cheetahs `` good '' , and white tigers `` evil '' ? With the hideous Orcs , it was much clearer to know where you stood.It 's tricky stuff to visually interpret this sort of material - there 's a degree of built-in tackiness to surmount . You think 'fantasy art ' , what usually comes to mind are illustrations that grace heavy metal album covers and the sides of 70s vans . With a few exceptions , Peter Jackson 's films escaped this almost entirely , creating a rich , evocative word tastefully . `` Narnia '' , however , is not as fortunate . What may be acceptable on the printed page can feel contrived , illogical or downright ridiculous on the screen . We watch chubby beavers waddle about in full battle regalia , and the White Queen in her polar-bear-drawn battle coach looks like an 80s vodka ad by way of Frank Frazetta.The effects work is uneven . Some characters , such as the griffins , are startlingly well-visualized , others feel rushed or cobbled together from warehouse leftovers . Aslan himself is well constructed but a bit overworked , his mane simulations flapping to distraction , his facial animation constantly pulsing . The design work is accomplished , but not distictive.The film is overly long , and lacks in charm as well as heft . The beaver sidekicks come off as a last-minute `` humor pass '' to the script in an attempt to lighten a fairly joyless enterprise . Lucy weeps so often for her fallen friends that it begins to lose its effect . Most of the supporting characters are thinly developed , so there 's few oppotunities for much empathy or lighter moments . While loyalty was a predominant theme in `` The Lord of the Rings '' , this story requires a fair degree of squabbling , which does n't help matters . Allegories aside , it 's a poor choice for young moviegoers . For the rest of us , the pleasures are visible , but sporadic .	-1
Narnia is an attempt to try to cash in on the success of the Lord of the Rings movies . If they really wanted to make a great adaptation , they should of spent more money on the CGI and makeup . You 'll notice right from the start that the budget for the movie was very small in comparison to LotR . I tried to enjoy it , but it just plodded along to slowly and abruptly.It 's hard trying to describe just how badly they put this movie together . The first 30 minutes of the movie consists of the kids finding the wardrobe . By the time they are actually in Narnia , you wo n't care because everything happens too fast . At one point they are flowing on a river of ice , and within 20 minutes of that event they are warriors and kings.That 's another problem . The kids have the ability to kill minotaurs and witches without any practice . The prophecy says that 4 kids will save the land of Narnia . The way the director shoots the movie , it makes the minotaurs and centaurs look like idiots . The kids become warlords without any training , and the hardy trained soldiers ca n't compete with them . In LotR , the characters have trouble defeating the powers of evil . In Narnia , the kids have the ability to beat evil easily , and it ruins the movie as it just comes off as stupid and implausible in the end.The worst part of the movie though lies in the weak performances of the characters . The kids do not show organic performances . I liked Peter at the beginning of the movie . One reviewer here mentioned how Peter constantly points his sword at everything . It 's true . Every time there is danger , Peter gets out his sword and points it at the enemy . He looks like an idiot when he does this . Edmund comes off as annoying and selfish . Lucy is just too happy about everything , and she gets annoying by the end . Susan is n't even used , as she contributes nothing to the movie except one point near the end.The books had a charm to them , yet the movie fails to capture any of that . I mentioned how the CGI and makeup department both did a bad job . It 's easy to spot when an animal is done with CGI and when someone is dressed up to look like a centaur .	-1
This stuff was meant for children . Please do not watch this if you like the phantasy genre as this is like watching Lord of the Rings with only Hobit action . The four children from the cast do give things a try , but the lines that they are to pronounce are deeply annoying and very likely from another century . Especially the youngest girl truly got on my nerves ! This is probably the clearest resemblence with Lord of the Rings as Frodo and Sam had lots of these tear jerking lines as well . The only violence you will get to watch in Narnia received a Disney treatment and the creatures Disney 's studio came up with here are no fun at all . After half an hour I could not resist to use fast forward anymore . ( SARR )	-1
**SPOILER ALERT ( possible spoilers for both the movie and the book ) **I , like every other lover of the , Chronicles of Narnia books , was very happy to find that someone had finally decided to do a big screen version of the second book in the Narnia series ( as although it was the first book written , The Magicians Nephew is the official first book in the reading order , and rightly so , as it explains the origins of the white witch , and why the professor is not so fast to dismiss Lucy 's claim of having visited Narnia ) .And when I finally saw the trailer , I was even more in anticipation of the films opening ( although , I must confess that the battle sequences shown in the trailer , seemed to me to be bordering a tad too much , on the , Lord Of The Rings , CGI , battles , and I had a slight fear that the film was going to try and cash in on the , Lord Of The Rings craze ) .Then , with popcorn and drink in hand , I settled down to what I though ( hoped , more like it ) was going to be a faithful telling of the great book ( a book that like , Harry Potter was n't just written for kids , but also for the kid inside , and thusly , could be equally enjoyed by both young and old alike ) .Oh sure , I was expecting the odd embellishments here and there , as movies always do , when sourced from a novel , but what they did , went WAY beyond the odd embellishments.Whole lines of amazing dialog , from the book , had been replaced with longer , but crappier lines , whole scenes changed , for no obviously good reason , and the worst part , is that , except for Lucy , all of the other children came off as whiners , who would spend their time in Narnia , wanting to go home and leave the fighting to the poor Narnians.In the book there is one instance where Susanne mentions that maybe they should go home , but when Lucy points out that they have to rescue the fawn who helped her , as it 's her fault that he 's been taken away , then from that moment on , all are intent on seeing it through to the end.But in the movie , it seems every other moment , Peter and Susanne are all for leaving the Narnians to there fate ( `` this is not our fight '' ) and saving their own skins.The only reason that they end up staying , and even fighting , in the final battle , is n't because they suddenly feel for the plight of the Narnians , but because they have no other choice.So at the end , when they are crowned as king and queens of Narnia , it feels wrong ( with the exception of Lucy , who stays true to her character in the book , through out the film ) .Because of the constant whining of Susanne and Peter , you never connect with them , as you do in the book , and thus , do n't really care what happens to them in the film.If you want to see a better telling of the story , then either the BBC mini-series or the animated TV special ( which are both available on DVD ) are much better.Oh sure , the BBC version tends to drag slightly in spots , and the special effects were done on a shoestring budget , but that is quickly forgotten , as the story unfolds , and you get swept up into the magical world of Narnia.The acting is much better ( especially in the case of the White Witch , who is played with over the top glee , by the actress portraying her , as is the way she is portrayed in the book ) and the writers and director , having realized that the book was so well written , that no liberties were needed to be taken , do a much better job of bringing the story to life.Also , the fawn in the BBC production is much more suited to the part , coming across as older and wiser , where as the younger fawn in the movie , just does n't play as true to the character in the book.All in all , I 'd have to say that I was very disappointed with the movie , and advise anyone watching it to either rent or buy , the BBC production , and watch , The Chronicles of Narnia , as they where intended to be seen .	-1
I fell in love with the chronicals of narnia when I was a young child . This movie does the book no justice at all . The computer animations are horrible and nothing near as good as the creatures on Peter Jackson 's The Lord of the rings . The actors are terrible and given a terrible script to learn . There is no warmth or love between the children making this movie very boring and annoying to watch . Aslan the lion is portrayed as a real wimp in this movie . The costumes especially the white witch 's costume look horrible . I 'd say as bad as something from a cheap community play . I do not suggest you waste your money on this atrocious movie unless you are such a huge fan of the C.S . Lewis series and your children do n't know any better . Maybe little kids would love this . Who knows for sure . I did n't like this boring and dull movie .	-1
No way would I be caught dead owning this DVD set , or even watching this series . I ca n't believe that Touchstone/Buena Vista is rushing this to market ( on Valentine 's Day , no less ) but are still stiffing us by not releasing the far superior Season Three of `` Once And Again '' ( originally scheduled for 1/10/06 , now indefinitely postponed . ) In fact , Buena Vista touts `` Once And Again '' in the press release for the DVD set of `` Grey 's , '' while still stalling on releasing the third season of `` O & A '' on DVD . Hypocrisy in the extremus , if you ask me . ( You 're reading this review , are n't you ? ) Come on Buena Vista Home Entertainment . Get off your high horse and give us quality DVD , not this twaddle . If you want to see a real medical show , drop what you 're doing , and write or e-mail 20th Century Fox and ask them to release the last five seasons of `` St . Elsewhere '' on DVD .	-1
grey 's anatomy is stupid and I do n't like it . It 's a girl show and it was put on my watchlist by my girlfriend . I thought I already reviewed it but here it is again . If I have to review each season of this show , I 'm going to go crazy .	-1
I 'm very sad , this movie is not playing correctly ! ! : ( The voice and picture do n't match up and are playing not in sync ONE bit ! ! : P	-1
Stay Alive is piece of garbage . Bad acting and even worse plotline , these bored 20 year olds play a violent video game called Stay Alive . After they play the game , the players start dying and bunch of nonsense ensues . Stay away from this b film , you 'll thank me later .	-1
`` Stay Alive '' is a movie about a video game called `` Stay Alive '' . Beware of the evil video game ! ! ! The premise behind this movie is that once your character dies in the game , you also die in real life . Scary , huh ? Well , no , not really . Ostensibly , `` Stay Alive '' comes across as being an original movie , unless one has seen other horror movies , especially recent ones like `` The Ring '' . `` Stay Alive '' certainly borrowed extensively from the far superior movie known as `` The Ring '' , and this is not a good thing because it 's very difficult to a pull a movie like that off , and `` Stay Alive '' fails miserably in this regard.Unlike `` Stay Alive '' , `` The Ring '' had much better actors in it , a much better story of which the viewer can actually buy into , and , even as far-fetched as it was , `` The Ring '' is actually capable of eliciting some horror in the audience along with making some degree of sense , at least by movie 's end . Oh , `` Stay Alive '' is certainly far-fetched and cliche-ridden , but it 's also very poorly-acted , generic , poorly executed and does not make any sense as other reviewers have already pointed out . `` Stay Alive '' requires too much of the viewer in his/her leap of faith with its gaping plot holes which makes for a ridiculously unrealistic movie . Now the fact that it has bad acting only makes it more apparent that this movie is completely stupid . It 's full of cheap little `` jump-out-at-you '' scares or scare attempts , but the movie is virtually lifeless . Unfortunately , `` Stay Alive '' offers very little in the way of plot , style and substance as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned . Finally , there are NO likeable characters in this movie and no one the viewer/audience can identify with and root for so to speak . All you have in this movie are a bunch of stupid 20 somethings who would not have enough sense to know to come in out of the rain.While `` Stay Alive '' may be somewhat suspenseful at first , it unfortunately spirals sharply downhill in a hurry as it progresses towards its miserable conclusion . All and all , it 's very difficult for the viewer to take this movie seriously ( yeah , it 's kind of a joke ) at all , and while I might recommend `` Stay Alive '' to the video game-obsessed teeny-bopper , I certainly would not recommend `` Stay Alive '' to any serious horror movie fan . If you 've got to watch it , make sure you watch it for free , but I would advise against wasting your time with this garbage .	-1
This has got to be one of the worst movies I 've ever seen. -- Not just bad , but appalling acting. -- Annoying , talentless , no-name actors/actresses. -- Mediocre special effects. -- Abysmal script. -- A production/writing/directing crew so out of touch with reality that they seem to think that what they portray as gaming culture bears some resemblance to reality. -- A total disregard for originality.My absolute biggest gripe was the whole 'legend of Elizabeth Bathory ' thing . I know countless books and games have used her as a basis for their own pathetic scare-fests , but come on - this was just ridiculous . How in the hell do you get a 15th century Romanian noblewoman to 18th century Louisiana ? Huh ? ! ? I 'd think there 'd be enough local color in southern Louisiana to draw on without having to do this . Good God - it was just completely nonsensical . It was as asinine as a group of kids sitting around in Phoenix , Arizona reminiscing about the legends of Genghis Khan riding out of the desert on his Harley with his Apache sidekicks.Take my advice and avoid this movie like the plague . I could feel my brain liquefying as I watched it .	-1
I like a good scary movie as much ( or more ) than the next person . But , truth be told , they are n't that easy to find anymore . Still , as I recently told a friend , I guess I 'll watch anything ! You never know what unexpected delights might be awaiting you , even in the unlikeliest of places . Because that 's just it ! I have hope , hope that I 'll be pleasantly surprised . That hope abandoned me as I settled in to view `` Stay Alive . '' Let 's be honest , this movie is no worse than dozens of other movies that are virtually indistinguishable from it in terms of casting and plotting . Basically , an attractive TV ready ensemble is knocked off one by one . That 's the same description for about 5671 other movies as well . My reaction to `` Stay Alive '' becomes apathetic because , while it may be competently made , there are absolutely no original ideas or images presented.The hook of `` Stay Alive '' is intriguing enough . A new videogame unleashes a murderous spell . If you are killed in the game , you will meet a similar gruesome end in the real world . Bummer . So , of course , our young cast all play the game . And they start dropping dead . One would hope , at least , for some creative carnage . But not here , seen it all before . The silliness that ensues include the requisite bumbling police investigation , the burgeoning romance , and the clues that lead to an immense estate ( that apparently no one knows about ) that resembles the environment in the game . I would say that the graphics in the game are the most visually interesting aspect of `` Stay Alive , '' but this seems rather silly -- I 'd just play a game if this was what was most important.Listen , I did n't hate this movie . The problem is that it barely registers at all . Jon Foster and Samaire Armstrong are likable and attractive enough . Foster , especially , has potential and talent . He was great in the overlooked `` The Door in the Floor '' with Jeff Bridges and a number of other projects . And Armstrong proved appealing in her TV roles on `` The OC '' and `` Entourage . '' I wish them well with future choices.You can watch `` Stay Alive '' if you like these films . You might even find it passable entertainment . But as it blends into the hundreds of similar films , is there anything that will cause you to remember this one fondly ? Nothing stood out for me , except maybe that Frankie Muniz ( from `` Malcolm in the Middle '' ) should n't wear a visor . But really , no one needs to wear a visor -- or should , for that matter ! I did n't need to see `` Stay Alive '' to come to that conclusion . Just like everything else in this routine and perfectly ordinary picture , I 'd figured everything out that I needed to within 5 minutes . KGHarris , 03/07 .	-1
No Country for old men has an interesting plot but you might be very disappointed in the ending ... .there is none ! Waste of time	-1
i 'm amazed at the positive reviews of this movie . it was terrible in my opinion . very slow , could n't understand half what everyone was saying . about as bas as 'the happening ' ... i got nothing out of this movie ... .let the comments ensue lol.i watched it for free and feel like i got ripped off	-1
This has got to be the worst best movie Oscar ever ! ! ! If all you care to see is a psychopathic killer ( how in God 's name did this guy when the best actor ? ? ? ) on the rampage , then this movie is for you . On top of that , the movie has one of the worst endings ever where everything in the movie is left up in the air . It does n't even deserve one star .	-1
just a mellow yellow movie was boring and quite , , loved the story but was kinda daydreaming when it was playing , , , i liked the airgun thing that was neat this just didnt inpress me with all the award crap -- - rent this at the least i wouldnt purchase this one	-1
This movie is pure garbage from start to finish . A pointless and plotless waste of time . Thank God I only rented it ... . Makes you wonder about the Oscar selection process .	-1
This is a review of the DVD quality , not the movie . The movie is awesome . The DVD is ok. A mediocre-quality digital transfer with distracting levels of blurring , over-saturated black-levels , and compression artifacts.The Blu-Ray version looks waaaay better.I 've seen plenty of DVDs that looked nearly as good as HDTV ( HD-DVD or Blu-ray ) . Not this one . There 's a substantial difference here . I use a Toshiba HD-A2 ( 720p ) and a PS3 , on new Pioneer 50 '' Kuro 720p plasma.You 'd think they 'd take care to make an excellent DVD transfer of a new release of this caliber , but apparently they did n't think it was important enough to spend the time and money to do it right since this is `` just '' DVD . Even if it would steal some shine from their blu-ray .	-1
For those of you who enjoyed being scared by Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs , you should really enjoy Javier Bardem in this movie . For those of you who do n't appreciate being scared and believe that movies that show violence should make the consequences of violence , ( grieving parents , disfigurement , ruined lives , ) apparent to the viewer , then this movie is not for you . All it is is scary violence . For two hours .	-1
This movie represents 2 hours of my life that I wish I had back ! Two hours that I could have been dusting my house or listening to Kenny G ! If zero stars were an option , that 's what I 'd give it . I just kept wishing it were over , but out of sheer stubborness I finished watching the entire thing ( not a prudent move ) ! Thank God I checked it out from the library and did n't waste 4 dollars to rent it ! Maybe in 1972 it would have been something to rave about ( cinematography , score , blah , blah , blah ) but it is terribly dated and I can think of a dozen classier ways to get the moral of the story across than this ! Maybe if you 're in film school you may get a shred of something worthwhile out of it ( maybe not ) , but for the majority of us who are n't , it 's a complete waste of time !	-1
I 'm not familiar with Stanley Kubrick and I was n't even born yet when this movie came out . All I can say is that this movie was way too long and I had to force myself to continue watching it to the annoying end . There were also way too many phallic images presented throughout the course of film . Just way too many . If you think the government giving a person medication to change bad behavior is controversial , just wait a few years . Soon your DNA will be collected as soon as your out of the womb . Your DNA will be tested to see if you have a `` criminal gene '' and then off you go to a facility to be given a microchip and medication to control you . I saw this movie once and I never want to see it again . Skip this one at all costs .	-1
I am sure this movie will appeal to spoiled brats who resent their parents and the establishment in this twisted immorality play . The film was playing when I was in college , and although I thought the poster looked neat , I never saw it . I realize now that it was garbage just like all those `` Billy Jack '' movies and the `` One Tin Soldier '' theme song . I saw the movie on Showtime recently and could not finish watching it . It was the kind of crap that only a liberal intellectual could love . I do own 2001 on Blue-Ray and appreciate that movie .	-1
so i finally watched the movie after i heard all it 's praise , and it was n't worth the money . So the book has potential because i thought the story was alright , but things were dragged on incredibly long . Such as the rape scenes , those were show much longer than actually needed . so i say again that maybe the book show more potenial . but as for the movie , it 's another thing ruined by the decade of the 70 's .	-1
I remember this movie from back in the day , however I was too young to watch it . So I thought I 'd check it out . I hated it . It sucked big time . To be fair I could only make it through about 30 minutes . It was too weird and I could n't even get into it .	-1
lots of wacky humor poor quality though not very well made give s bad ideas to kids movie down right is crap	-1
Idiotic storyline ... preposterous acting borderlining on the brink of all characters being insane . Ugly sets and backgrounds . I can not say anything positive about this film other than there was an end to it . I am unmoved and in the dark as to what Stanley Kubrick 's meaning was if a legitimate point existed . The title itself is ridiculous ... I wonder if potent hallucinogenics were involved . Total waste . I will not merit it one star ( if I had the option ) . One last thought ... does Kubrick intend his main character to be so unpleasant and unattractive to watch ?	-1
4-1/2 Stars on Amazon ! What are you people smoking ? ? ? It must be pot because this movie is definitely a child of the 60 's . Tacky psychedelic colors , gaudy sexual artwork , weird music , free love , and a couch shaped like an egg . Yep . We 're in the 60 's alright.Sorry folks , but this movie is a real STINKER . It is HORRIBLE ! I am sure that all you fanboys out there ( I 'm sure there wo n't be any girls ) will say that I just did n't `` get it . '' Pray tell , what is there to `` get '' ? A guy is extremely violent ( so we are told ) , the government changes him to not be violent but in doing so takes away his free will , and then that same government later `` cures '' him of his lack of free will by making him violent again . And along the way we are treated to a few extremely tame rape scenes , some quite boring and untintillating sex scenes , some horrible artwork , a bunch of weird people including a guy who grabs our protagonist 's crotch , some cheesy dialogue that no actual person would ever utter , and a few acts of `` ultraviolence '' that were pretty darn weak . Oh , and I nearly forgot ... Some accompanying classical music . Did I miss anything ? At least I did get to see some boobs . As a guy I can appreciate such a thing . But that does n't redeem this movie , or make it worth watching by any means.I am not a fanboy who grew up watching this . I was born a decade after this movie came out . I decided to watch this movie because I had saw that it was one of the most critically-acclaimed and best sci-fi movies of all time . WTF ? This movie STINKS ! ! ! The things that I enjoyed most about this movie were not intended by the creator . I enjoyed looking at all the pschedelic 60 's crap in the movie . It 's always fun to look at all the funky things that people back then envisioned for the future . A couch shaped like a big plastic egg ? Sure . Weird porno art on everybody 's walls ? No problem . A bar with statues of naked women serving as tables ? Sounds good to me . Something better than a giant record player as a sound system ? Sorry . That 's just too difficult to envision.The acting in this movie was really strange . People said and did things that made absolutely no sense whatsoever , for inexplicable reasons . Their facial expressions also did all kinds of weird things that were nothing that any actual human being could ever relate to . It was slightly comedic at times , which almost made the movie worth watching . ALMOST.I liked watching Malcom McDowell 's acting . He was very energetic and interesting . The movie would have suffered even more than it already does without him . I did n't recognize him as Dr. Soren from Star Trek : Generations , but he plays a great crazy person in both movies . I did find it quite revolting to watch him eat at the end of the movie , however . Hey Orange boy , stop smacking will ya ? But the bottom line is that this movie is the most highly OVERRATED crap I 've seen in a long , long time . This movie has got about as much hype , if not more , than that stinker `` Titanic '' did . I honestly do not know why `` A Clockwork Orange '' gets such rave reviews . Maybe you people are just into weirdness . Well if that 's the case , then this is definitely your movie.Weird people , weird talking , weird faces , weird places , weird actions , weird backgrounds , weird music , weird sex , weird story , and a weird name that is essentially meaningless until you hear the `` Mechanical Orangutan '' story ( given outside of the movie ) that is supposed to explain it.Yeah , sounds like cinematic genius to me.Some people might say , `` Well you either love it or hate it . '' But it 's not that I hate this movie . I just do n't understand why so many people seem to like it so much . It has little redeeming value in my opinion , and certainly has nothing in it that I ever care to see again . The sex was lame . The `` ultraviolence '' was tame . The story was dull . Overall , it is a truly uninspiring bit of awfulness.Speaking of the `` ultraviolence '' , what exactly , are we talking about here ? Here is all the violence you get in this movie:1 . 4 Guys beat up a tramp.2 . 4 Guys try to rape a woman who gets away.3 . 4 Guys beat up 4 other guys.4 . 1 Guy knocks another guy in a 2-foot deep stream and then cuts another guy on the hand . ( Oooh . Scary ! ) 5 . 4 Guys break into one house , tie up the husband to watch , and then apparently ( it does n't show it ) rape the wife.6 . 1 Guy hits some lady on the head with a statue and kills her.7 . 3 Guys beat up the 1 guy.8 . Some lady gets raped by a group of guys , or so we are told.9 . 4 Guys dunk another guy in a water trough ( he survives ) .That 's it . ULTRAVIOLENCE ? Give me a flippin ' break ! I 've seen worse in a Saturday morning cartoon . Sure , the rape scenes SOUND pretty bad as I describe them . But they are actually extremely tame and quite weak . A few clothes are ripped , we get the idea that the woman is struggling , and then it is on to the next scene . I would think that a rape scene should be very scary to watch . These were not scary at all , most of the time with whimsy music playing in the background or our protagonist singing `` Singing in the Rain '' . It just made it all seem very unrealistic , undramatic , and fake . Not to mention stupid.A Clockwork Orange . This is ( maybe ) the worst movie I have ever seen in my life . I wish this was not even called Science Fiction , because it besmirches the name of Good Sci-Fi . It is not worthy of the title . CO is nothing more than an overrated piece of garbage . The only reason it has won so many awards and been so critically acclaimed is that it is supposed to be `` art '' , and somehow if a bad movie qualifies as `` art '' , then it is above reproach . Rubbish ! NOW , LET THE `` NOT HELPFUL '' VOTES BEGIN ! ! !	-1
I saw this crappy movie just out of curiosity about Vincent D'Onofrio aka Goren in his early days . It 's not even worth one viewing . The best part of the movie is the first half , parts of which ( I think ) are viewable online ; and R. Lee Ermey ( a real-life soldier in the army ) is hilarious as Sergeant Hartmann . I really dislike this movie because it 's not a cohesive narrative . There 's not one character ( except maybe Gomer Pyle ) that you can really care about , but even Pyle does n't get enough screen time . It 's just as if there are two parts of an idea assembled in a hurry , and the result is a huge mess . To quote a blurb describing another movie , `` Scattershot narrative . '' Worth only one viewing . Not as bad as `` Scarface '' ( 1982 ) , but almost . Rated R .	-1
I did n't care one bit about anyone in this movie . I found myself not caring about someone going crazy and killing his family ... because I did n't care about him or his family . I just did n't care ... ever . And I did n't find it the least bit scary . I could n't wait for it to get over . I like most King movies ... but this one just dragged on forever .	-1
A mother and son who find themselves trapped at an empty hotel with an axe-wielding killer are the ones I 'm supposed to rooting for , but all the while I 'm hoping he chops them to bits . Then I 'll no longer have to look at their asinine facial expressions . They 're terrified , yes ; if an axe to the face is n't scary enough , the hotel is also haunted by ghosts ; but director Stanley Kubrick does n't seem to realize that it 's possible to be terrified with a straight face . Exaggerated grimaces , especially in the case of the mother ; the pathetic victim type a villain in this type of movie thrives on ; takes away from any potential realism The Shining has to offer.But that 's a side issue . The main problem here is the story itself , which , thanks mostly to an unnecessary reliance on paranormal activity ; `` shining '' apparently means a form of telepathy ; is often nonsensical , or , at best , confusingly random . Is Jack Torrance going crazy or is he really seeing ghosts ? That seems like a valid question until his wife starts seeing them too . Then the answer should be that he 's not going crazy . But he obviously is . So the answer must be both , which is all too convenient for the plot ; a plot that is now allowed to lazily throw logic out of a hotel room window in favor of creepiness for the sake of being creepy.marcellee.com	-1
I 'm not the biggest fan of Stephen King . I 've only read a couple of his books , and find them notoriously difficult to get into . Especially Carrie , get to the point ! My dad has all his books , the only one I think I actually enjoyed was The Green Mile . I do n't remember ever reading The Shining book , I have seen the movie before though with my dad.The first positive thing I will say , is that some of the opening scenes , and the scenery around the Outlook Hotel , is crisp and so gorgeous in High Definition . The opening shots , when the camera is tracking the car driving up the mountains , is absolutely amazing . It 's just perfect.The score to this movie is really atrocious though . It 's not even nice noise , it 's jerky and meaningless . It does n't add to the movie . I could have done a better score . It just does n't work , or enhance the movie in any way.Jack playing funnily enough Jack , is amazing . He 's the only reason for watching this movie . His portrayal of Jack slowly descending into madness ( `` All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy '' ) makes you keep watching the movie , since he 's in pretty much nearly every scene . Up against Shelley Duvall ( who I was n't keen on personally ) , he steals the show , even when she 's doing her wide eyed screaming scenes . He does his utmost to scare the viewers , and he certainly scared me . There is a couple of times I have to look away from the screen - especially one of his last scenes in the movie when he 's frozen . I actually have to turn physically away when that happens , I ca n't watch him , that image is burned into my mind now.There 's something about the late Stanley Kubrick 's work , that I really do n't like . I 've seen this now twice , and I 've also seen Eyes Wide Shut , and neither seems to have anything that resembles a plot . And he was such a perfectionist as well , getting actors to ridiculous amounts of takes ( 127 takes for Shelley for one scene ) . Nah . They just do n't appeal somehow.I do n't understand what all the good reviews are for . I do n't get it .	-1
Could Not Watch it would run 10 seconds of the film then stream for 5 minutes . The quality buttons went from 4 to 1 This continued for 6 tries and then I finally gave up . Just got done reading the book and was very interested to see how the movie was . Is there a way to strengthen the signal so it will not do this ? Also make sure you order the HD version because the non HD is awful .	-1
This film would be great if they had not made such a horrible editing mistake at the start of the film . As you see the main character 's VW Bug driving to the hotel during the opening credits , there are several great helicopter shots . In one shot , you can see the shadow of the helicopter on the side of the mountain . It makes the film appear cheap and not well made . If they would fix this short shot , and edit that out , then the film would be wonderful . I understand this film is good , do n't get me wrong , but little mistakes so obvious take away from the overall effect of the film , and make it look like no effort was put into production .	-1
Stephen King 's THE SHINING , is one of the less suspenseful and less action-packed novels compared to most of his others . Unfortunately , -as with most of King 's flics , which are , generally-speaking , one-star debacles- the movie , `` The Shining '' is n't even half as good as the mediocre novel was.The Shining is flawed in about every conceivable way : With the exception of Jack Nicholson , the remaining actors are far more insipid and less interesting and solid as the book would have you imagine them being . The movie omits some of the novel 's best moments , and when the movie DOES N'T omit suspenseful moments from the book , it either shows it in a very cheesy , unsuspenseful manner and/or does n't follow the book accurately . ( E.g. , Jack Nicholson was supposed to be using a mallet to injure people , not an axe ; the black man arrived at the hotel by way of a snowplow with a roof , but in the book it was a snowmobile , etc . ) All in all , The Shining ends up being the most boring , suspenseless , and one of the cheesiest Stephen King flics I 've ever seen.The movie may be worth purchasing if you are an extremely die-hard King connoisseur , but if not then do n't even consider this disastrous film .	-1

Chevy Chase must 've been EXTREMELY A desperate for money if he stooped this low to make a piece of unfunny trash like this.Watch as Chevy throws away his wonderful acting talent in this holiday turkey.Groan in agony as the unfunny relative makes that sick joke about the family cat being fried-a joke that 's so sick that it would even make a cat-hater shake with pure anger . Avoid this trashy movie , and if you were unfortunate to have this movie , then burn it.If you want a funny movie , go with `` Liar , Liar '' or Jeff Foxworthy videos instead .	-1
I bought the 20th anniversary addition thinking the dvd was getting an overhaul , plus all the cool extras , I was wrong . Its the same 2003 version just with a different picture on the disc and dvd cover and for 31 $ thats not worth it . All the extra stuff is cool and so is the tin , but to reissue the same disc with no extras just is n't very cool , especially when I already own the 2003 special edition . So save your money and buy the 2003 version or upgrade to Blu Ray .	-1
This movie was n't released , it ESCAPED ! How could they mess up a CHevy CHase movie so badly ? All they had to do was put a camera on him and let it roll ! The hard part would have been to edit it down to 90 minutes . This was a disaster movie without the action . PASS ! ! !	-1
Watching this movie is the most fun I 've ever had in my ilfe . It is absolutely the worst movie that has ever been made , and it 's so so funny to see how STUPID they made this . You can tell straight from the beginning . Just listen to that guy 's voice . You know , the guy with so much vibrato you ca n't tell which one of the 10 notes he 's actually trying to sing . I was rolling on the ground in hysterics when I heard his singing voice.The Return of the King was not by Bakshi . It was by the guys who made the Hobbit movie ( which was actually pretty good ) : Rankin and Bass . But there is one difference between the Hobbit and Return of the King : they really messed up in Return of the King . This might be because the cutesy-wutesy-ness actually worked in the Hobbit . But Return of the King is a much darker book . At least , so I thought . Maybe they did n't think that.For one thing , how many Tolkien names can you mispronounce in one sentence ? `` Gore-uh-gore-uth '' , `` Sore-awn '' , `` Sear-ith Un-gawl '' , `` Mine-us '' Tirith and Morgul , etc . etc . etc.For another thing , Glenn Yarbrough should be shot . Although it is quite hysterical to listen to him sing . Kind of like it 's hysterical to watch the auditions for American Idol every year . And Maury Laws should be shot too , at least if it were n't for `` Where there 's a whip there 's a way '' , the only good song in the whole movie . Which is ruined by the funny-looking orc choir , anyway.And how many times can you say `` festering malignance '' in the first five minutes of a movie ? They say that so much that you wonder if they knew what the hell they were talking about . `` Sore-awn 's evil lay over the land like a festering malignance ! `` And the voice-actors should be shot too . I 'm not going to go into that -- it would take me forever.But wait , there 's more ! Where the they get the part about Hobbits eventually evolving into Men ? According to Tolkien , Hobbits are still around today . They did n't EVOLVE into Men ! Seems like a terrible excuse to stick one of the corniest lines in the movie in : `` Men will look back and wonder ... 'Is there Hobbit in me ? ' '' Tolkien must be rolling over in his grave every time somebody turns on this movie.And what 's with the ringwraiths ? Or , as this movie puts it , skeletons with hair.Not to mention the weird voices for people like The Mouth of Sauron and the Lord of the Nazgul . And Aragorn . Speaking of which , why did they turn him into some sort of evil Hitler figure ? And why did he only get a cameo , anyway ? He was more important than that . Plus the fact that Legolas and Gimli are n't shown or even mentioned at all.And what 's with the SAMWISE THE STRONG segment ? Possibly the least emphasized part of the books , if it was in the books at all , has now been turned into the climactic centerpiece of the first half of the movie . Plus the fact that he goes on to console himself with images of little Hobbit babies . And then there 's Frodo 's dream about a free Mordor . I do n't think I 'm even going to go into that , or I 'll start rambling even more than I already am . I mean , seriously , the orc walks by and waves to Frodo as if they were the best friends in the world . And was that a streak of a tear on Frodo 's face as he waved back ? Ugh.And the eye of Sauron did n't look like an eye at all . It looked like an oddly small red crystal ball . Which does n't make sense at all . I did n't even know what it was until near the very end when I saw it was at the top of a tower.Also , the dialogue is absolutely absurd . Just think about this exchange , after Denethor has ordered himself executed.Pippin : No ! You ca n't ! Guard : His word is law.Pippin : I 'll find Gandalf.What spontanaiety.And what 's the point of showing Eowyn with Faramir at the very end , when you do n't even know who the hell Faramir is ? Hello , this is a different movie than the Bakshi Lord of the Rings , and therefore Faramir looks different anyway ! Err ... come to think of it , I ca n't remember if Faramir was even in the Bakshi film . I think he was though.And why does it look like Theoden jumps off of his horse , instead of falling off ? And the horse should trample him or fall on him or something , because a fall of that little magnitude would n't hurt a guy enough to kill him . Especially a tough guy like Theoden . Or maybe that 's another alteration from the book . Theoden is a weakling ? Hmm . Whatever.And their stuff about Bilbo falling asleep and not cutting the cake ? Was that supposed to be funny ? Oh . Ha ha . He 's falling asleep . What in the world could be more hysterical ? That was sarcasm.I could go on and on . In fact , I already have .	-1
I am stunned at all the rave reviews of this , this , well this nonsensical garbage . Do n't get me wrong , its cool that they went through all that trouble to make this flik , but do n't you think if your going to do it , shouldn , t you leave out all the musical numbers ? Which brings me to my next point . Alot of these glowing reviews say that this is much better than Peter Jackson 's version because it sticks more to the source material . WHAT ! Where did that come from ? I 'm sure Tolkien just forgot to write sappy seventies music every other chapter . Oh yeah , and he probably did n't want Legolas and Gimli in the third book anyhow . He just needed someone like Rankin to figure how to write them out . To bad Tolkien was already gone to fix his mistake.Best parts of the movie you say ? Well seeing anything of Tolkien usually gives me goosebumps , and at least seeing the title brings some nice memories of the book and P.J . 's film . ( Finally the bumbling , fat faced cartoon version of Sam is purged from my mind ! ! Thank you Astin ! ! ) Its almost worth viewing just to see the two greatest scences ever penciled on paper . ( Just kidding ) . Frodo 's lovely little dream with the orc wandering by and waving to him as if to say `` thanks for the tea ! '' while he just lounges back against a tree has got to be seen to be believed . And the wonderful little song `` Where thrers a whip , Theres a way '' is hilarious . Orcs singing about not wanting to fight just tickled me all over . Ca n't believe Tolkien left out that part.But wait , there 's more . The Witch King was just an electronic laugh just like in the Transformers . Really it was . And Gandalf ? He was nothing more than somebody reading a script in a nice monotone voice that was even more perfected as the battles rose in a fevered pitch around him.All I can say is that even if you like it ( or dare I say Love it ) , at least strike up the courage to say that the Peter Jackson version is closer to the book.ThanksOh yeah , I gave it two stars because at least it has Tolkien 's name on it .	-1
I hate to say it , but this was not what I had hoped for . The guy who keeps singing , all through the film , over and over again , was mind-numbingly irritating . He really wrecked the whole thing . It was as if Rankin and Bass wanted to make a musical , and not a film portraying the dire events in Tolkein 's tale . There was a song in nearly every scene ! The only things the characters were missing , during these warbling little sing-song episodes , were ice-skates . Ugh ! One other point that spoiled the film was the poorly contrived dialogue . Granted , this word-waxing excess was somewhat present in the Rankin/Bass release of The Hobbit , but not to the overblown , and wretchedly unabashed heights of this production . It just did n't carry very well at all : especially when Samwise is talking to himself , like some Shakespearean sycophant on an amphetamine binge , while Frodo is locked in the tower . The Bible had less & quot ; thee 's & quot ; and & quot ; thou 's & quot ; strung through it 's whole breadth than were encapsulated in that one scene . My advice is to enjoy Rankin/Bass 's version of The Hobbit , ( where exposure to bad singing , and over-emphasis , are muted by some very good craftsmanship ) , then get Bakshi 's Lord of the Rings , ( because THAT is as good a movie adaptation , for this story , as we have gotten : to this date ) , skip Rankin/Bass 's Return of the King , ( it 's just not what it could have been , and if you 're of an age above 10 it will probably nauseate you ) and get ready for the LOTR Trilogy movies , starting Christmas 2001 ! ( Do n't forget Tolkien 's books , though . They are better than any film about them will ever hope to be . READ THEM ! ! ! )	-1
GLIMMER MAN ANOTHER DISSAPOINTMENT , JUST THE TYPICAL ODD AIKIDO FIGHTS WHICH WERE TAME , AND THE ATION SCENES WERE BAD AND THE END FIGHT AS JUST THE ODD HIT AND KILL SEGAL IS TAME AT WHAT HE DOES AND THE MUSIC TO THE FILMS ARE BAD ASWELL	-1
The Road Warrior is a classic , but does n't have Spanish subtitles on the features . I hate when a good moviecomes without this feature .	-1
This DVD ( s ) was a disappointment in terms of selection . Only one song by Janis . No real songs by Crosby-Stills-Nash that were seen , only heard . A lot of the background stories are interesting . I agree that it does take you back to a time that will never return , which is sad .	-1
It is rare that I get offended by a movie . This one did it . Meryl Streep is married to a wonderful husband who she completely fails to appreciate . He 's nothing . Take a hike , jerk . The man she falls for , to the point of insisting on being buried with when the time comes , is some guy who drifted into her life for a week while her husband had taken the kids on a camping trip . Sure he 's a nice guy . But what kind of advantage is that . Who will a woman be more excited about - her husband of 20 years or some handsome new guy who falls for her while hubby is away ? This ditz seems to think that she and her lover are doing the family a favor by not splitting up the family . Who the hell is she ? I hope her husband had a few dozen girls on the side . It would be hard to find a more unappreciative or a stupider wife than the one starring in this movie . He 's a photographer . Whoop de doo .	-1
I know this is a film for women , but I also know there must be some women out there who see this for what it is : overly sentimental schmaltz to the point of ridiculousness . Meryl Streep plays the Italian-American housewife Francesca and Clint Eastwood plays the free-spirited photographer Robert . Streep spends most of the film crying . I 'm not joking ... .there are about 5 10-minute scenes with her silently in tears to the obligatory piano/violin soundtrack . Clint does his best to act like he loves her , but it 's not too convincing . And the film is framed as a flashback by Francesca 's son and daughter , their badly-acted soap opera subplot and their nadir personalities nauseating this reviewer . Robert tries to get Francesca to `` come away with me '' , but , you guessed it , she has a family to consider . Their relationship borders on pathetic . One thing I know ; I would n't want to `` come away with '' the emotionally unstable Francesca.Dirty Harry/Blondy does not belong in this terrible waste of film . And Sophie made the wrong Choice to lower herself to this . Then again neither of these great actors have done anything significant in the last 10 years . Another Streep film even worse than this , believe it or not , is Falling in Love with Robert Deniro with basically the same plot as Bridges . And if you want to see a great Clint ( out of control ) romance see Play Misty for Me .	-1
This is a very good , touching and terrifying at times film about how people use , intimidate and ill-treat each other even among families . A poor , long-suffering lady is close to a mental breakdown and comes to seek out her sister for help but in the end this only leads to a totally opposite outcome . Both Leigh and Brando put in excellent performances here and so does Karl Malden who together with Brando would go on to even better things with `` On the Waterfront . `` The problem is with the DVD which has n't been restored at all making for very , very poor picture and sound quality . With the advent of Blu-Ray , here 's hoping they would take this opportunity to totally remaster this film and to add good bonus features which are totally missing here . Dolby Digital 5.1 surround or DTS THX sound options would be a real treat.This is a good film but I recommend you wait for a much better restored version to surface and not to waste your hard earned money on this very , very poor DVD version .	-1
'The Exorcist ' is a really silly movie . Who in the 21st century believes in devils and demons , and who would actually be scared by such nonsense ? Why has the devil decided to possess this little girl ? Why does n't the devil possess somebody powerful so he can influence other people and take over the world ? What is the devil trying to achieve by taking over the little girl ? The movie does n't answer such important questions.A lot of the movie is just shock value . There is no substance underneath . In 1973 this may have been scary , but now it looks ridiculous . Hopefully , trash like this can disappear and be forgotten over time .	-1
Fat too many people slow down for a car wreck . What is it that they want to see ? Mangled bodies and blood ? Here we have a young girl masturbating with a crucifix and shouting , `` F*** me ! F*** me ! '' to a priest . Now if that 's your cup of tea , you 'll love this movie . Great performances , excellent atmosphere , and technically proficient , but very sickening . After watching `` The Exorcist '' you may have a desire to take a shower to get clean again .	-1
When Exorcist hit the big screen in the seventies , audiences around the nation waited in lines around the block to get into theatres everywhere . This movie revolted , facsinated , and flat out scared the hell out of them , and most of them loved it ! The rest either fled the theatre in sheer terror , or became sick , and went home to turn on all the lights , and head straight for church the next AM . Wow . What a movie , and a stroke of brilliant filmmaking , to get an audience to behave as such . There are many subtle scenes that may escape those who only want to see head spinning and green pea soup . Such as the young priest 's disturbing dreams about his mother . Young Regan fooling around with an Ouija Board , or the nasty demonic visage that keeps popping it 's face throughout the possessed house . Regan eventually transforms into one of the most terrifying monsters in cinematic history . Her possessed 12 yr. old girl character is demonic , vile and pure evil . One can almost feel the chill in her room , or smell her repulsiveness . Dr. Billy Graham himself admitted that the film had a sense of real evil to it . The reason it scares us is fear of the unknown . If one is strictly an atheist , then it is sheer nonsense . But if one has faith in God , or any gods , then possession is a VERY real reality . The fact that the film 's screenplay was based on a real story that happened in the Midwest in the fifties , only adds to the sense of dread and terror that one feels alone at night after viewing this movie . Throughout history , and in the Bible there are many mentions of demonic possession . If these instances werent mere seizures , or mental illness , then perhaps the horror that Linda Blair portrays is chillingly real .	-1
Is there anything to be gained from this genre ? As Bishop Sam Aquila wrote in a foreward to Father Jose Antonio Fortea'sInterview With an Exorcist , * `` Although all Catholics should have a basic understanding of the reality of evil , we should also avoid being overly preoccupied with the topic of the devil . The Evil One is capable of using such a fascination as a means to ensnare us - with despair , fear , or discouragement '' ( p. 3 ) .Right on ! We can be absolutely assured that only God is All Powerful , and He is absolutely victorious over the devil ! In surrendering to God , who loves each and every one of us limitlessly , we find absolute fulfillment and untold happiness.Four decades ago , it appears that the green stuff ( i.e. , the money , not the pea soup ) got the better of the author : * `` while I was working on 'The Exorcist , ' what I thought I was writing was a novel of faith in the popular dress of a thrilling and suspenseful detective story - in other words , a sermon that no one could possibly sleep through -- and to this day I have n't the faintest recollection of any intention to frighten the reader , which many will take , I suppose , as an admission of failure on an almost stupefying , scale ... .I do keep wishing ... that 'The Exorcist ' be remembered at this time of the year for being not about shivers but rather about souls , for then it would indeed be in the real and true spirit of Halloween , which is short for the eve of All Hallows or All Saints Day '' ( William Peter Blatty , FoxNews.com & lt ; [ ... ] > , 10/28/11 ) That 's great Bill , but what about all that money for the crap which was actually put on film ? The simple reality is this : Your best take on exorcism is to be found in theCatechismor theCompendium of the Catechism .	-1
Beware ! `` The Version You 've Never Seen '' is either a joke or somebody 's colossal mistake . There appear to be scenes left out , at least compared to my memory of the original , which makes the plot frustratingly hard to follow in places . By the end my head was spinning and I was vomiting pea soup . The Exorcist is a great film , definitely five stars , but spend your money on one of the other versions . This turkey is going in the trash instead of to Goodwill ; I 'm not a sadist .	-1
`` The Exorcist '' scared me so mucht that it was hard to sleep at night . The movie was too scary to be enjoyable . It is fun to watch movies that are scary , but have some comical or entertaining moments . This movie was just plain horrific violence . What was the point of this film ? To prove that devils can get inside peoples ' bodies and turn them into evil , dispicable , deplorable , and gory half human half demon beings ? I 'm a Catholic , and I have read in the Bible that this has happened . But , what is the point of watching this movie , just to make you sleepless at night and worrying if the devil will enter your body ? I did n't watch the whole film . Maybe there was something in there that explained more detail about it . If so , then I apologize for being so critical of the movie . But if not , I say stick with films that are scary , but still have meaning , like `` Cape Fear '' or `` The Hand That Rocks the Cradle '' or `` Misery '' . Or , if you 're a horror fan , stick with `` The Shining '' .	-1
A modestly entertaining , well-made thriller that has somehow managed to tap into the collective unconscious in a way that few movies ever have.I found the film to be occasionally disturbing ( never once actually frightening ) and generally convinced that it had something serious to say about GOOD and EVIL . What exactly it is that the film has to say about GOOD and EVIL is never exactly made clear . The anniversary edition of the DVD features interviews with William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty , who speak in hushed tones about the conception/execution of the film , as if they were discussing the creation of some deep and profound work of art . However , all of their best intentions/pretensions can not disguise the fact that The Exorcist is , in the final analysis , a deeply silly little horror movie , with nothing really important or especially very interesting to say.Still , there are a couple of good jolts , though ...	-1
OK , I would say this is the worst movie ever , but Blade Runner , A Clockwork Orange and In The Name of the King have those titles . There is no background for the old guy in the beginning . We do n't know why the demon selected this particular child . The younger priest that first meets the possessed chick does n't even try to do it himself first before bringing in the other guy ( again , no real explanation ) . The self sacrifice at the end is empty and really did n't have any value ( they left nothing behind as far as we know ) . The detective is a joke , provides absolutely no value to the story . Only watch if you enjoy movies that provide absolutely no entertainment value .	-1
Because films are frequently the closest contact people have with certain subjects , one must look at how this film approaches a very real and socially escalating problem : `` child abuse '' ( as well as the acknowledged , but never dealt with `` spousal '' and `` familial abuses '' ) and the consequences of such `` abuse . '' Let me state for the record that even though I have taught numerous classes on this subject , and frequently in disagreement with my peers , I find it repulsive that we as a society and nation belittle reality with the term `` abuse . '' It is my belief that there is nothing `` abusive '' about another person assaulting or terrorizing another person , and that it is demeaning , stigmatizing , stereotyping , and trivializing to say it is `` abuse . '' Moreover , I would argue that it is a consequence of not recognizing that the story in the film is about assault and battery , and the terrorizing -- not `` abuse '' -- of children ( and others ) , that the makers and stars of the film were unsure how to present the story in more poignant and dramatic fashion.Despite one 's position ( `` abuse '' versus assault/terrorism ) on the subject mater of the story , the script and theme of the film -- which really is more about how to `` deal '' with the effects of such actions -- can only be described as cynical and pessimistic at best ; and , more realistically , illegal/morally corrupt and vigilantism . Because , as far as I am concerned , what the film is about , when the movie ends , is that revenge is sweeter than either the victim 's health or justice , let alone how to realistically deal with the problem . That is , the film condones the notion that the `` best '' thing one can do as a victim is break the law themselves , exacting revenge on their perpetrators while maintaining the illusion they and others see : that nothing ever happened to them . The failure of such an approach is alluded to at the end of the movie -- two of the boys ( victims ) get killed acting out just as they were treated , and the two other boys become ( depressed ) lost and lonely in society . BUT I question how evident this is to most viewers . Indeed , my gut reaction to the film the first time I watched it was : `` Yeah , that 's how you deal with sicko child predators : kill them ! '' AND this is the movies `` undoing , '' while it is also what gives the film a feel good dramatic effect on viewers.As a society , most people `` feel good '' when revenge -- especially when concealed in the imagery of `` justice '' -- is the conclusion of the story . So what if the prosecutor broke numerous laws to lose the case ; that a priest committed perjury ( which is acceptable , apparently , since the president can do so without consequences ) ; two `` hardened '' criminals -- who essentially admitted to killing the guard ( Kevin Bacon 's character ) -- are found `` innocent '' of murder ; and another man/guard is killed `` street '' style by a drug lord ? In a society that refuses to acknowledge the true nature of `` abuse , '' and therefore coddles said criminals ( as well as allowing so called `` abuse '' to be used as an excuse for the victim 's own criminal actions ) , people -- myself at times , as well -- need an outlet to feel like something is being done.Movies ( and other media ) such as `` Sleepers '' provide that relief ; and in doing so , I think , conceive a dramatic and satisfying exposure to one of our greatest threats to social order , in the movie `` Sleepers . '' As such , this allows the viewer to empathize with the characters and theme of `` Sleeper , '' and come away satisfied or really liking the movie . I think `` Sleepers '' also allows the viewer to ( incorrectly ) believe that the problem is not as bad as it is , and that it is being dealt with by others . As such , `` Sleepers '' essentially provides the viewer a sense that `` Yes , 'abuse ' is out there , but it is being dealt with by `` someone '' else ; so who cares ? `` However , it also keeps the viewer from asking more important questions : Does such revenge help the victims ? Does such revenge help prevent the problem ? Why are we as individuals so willing to view such violence and crime as nothing more than `` abuse ? '' How is child assault and terrorism ( aka `` abuse '' ) effecting other people , in addition to the victims and perpetrators -- that is , to what degree has this problem disrupted/destroyed families , relationships , jobs , beliefs , and other socio-cultural aspects of our lives ? I purchased this movie based on two factors : the amazing cast and other reviews praising how well the film was made , glossing over the subject matter . Unfortunately , the cast -- for the most part -- gave mediocre performances relative to their past portrayals in other films ; although , collectively , they did well enough to keep the drama moving forward . As such , `` Sleepers '' is an average movie , with an amazing cast of stars who , on the face of it , give solid performances ; but really just `` walk '' their way through their scenes , being themselves . But , then again , an average performance by Robert Deniro or Dustin Hoffman is often superior to a really great performance my lesser actors.Update -- 1 July 2008 : If this review was not helpful to you , I would appreciate learning the reason ( s ) so I can improve my reviews . My goal is to provide help to potential buyers , not get into any arguments . So , if you only disagree with my opinion , could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful . Thanks .	-1
Just viewed a few minutes of this movie and stopped watching because of the rough language . Do not believe this kind of language is needed to make a good movie .	-1
Set just after the 1916 Easter Rebellion in Dublin , Neil Jordan 's film follows the life and times of Irish revolutionary Michael Collins ( Liam Neeson ) , detailing his relationships with Kitty Kearnan ( Julia Roberts ) , Harry Boland ( Aidan Quinn ) , and Eamon de Valera ( Alan Rickman ) . It essentially covers the period leading up to the Civil War in Ireland , and ultimately Collins ' untimely death.It must be said the movie proves to be an opportunity missed , considering the budget and all involved . While it is usual for historical epics to have inaccuracies , & quot ; Michael Collins & quot ; is rather a disaster . After a very self conscious opening scene , the film seems to loose it 's way and trods a distinctly uneven and incomprehensible path . It tries to hard to be all things : epic war film , romantic movie , and politically descisive . It fails on all counts , essentially because it is biased towards one side of the argument , and ridicules the other . The script seems to make no attempt at exploring the intricacies of the politics involved which led to Civil War , and the picture ends up like something a not very knowledgable schoolboy would write in primary school . Despite Liam Neeson 's historonics , the casting in disasterous - particulary Aidan Quinn as an americanised Harry Boland , and Julia Roberts resembling a cross between Maureen O'Hara and Tinkerbell . What ultimately comes across from the acting is a cast who just want to pick up their pay check as quickly as possible and move as swiftly as they can onto their next , more serious , production.The film is particulary offensive to those brave men and women who would not accept half measures , and took the view that the Anglo Irish Treaty was not the Republic of Easter Week 1916 . Certain historical figures are missing , especially Arthur Griffith and Cathal Brugha ( although Gerard McSorely appears in a brief scene with a & quot ; mcsorely & quot ; wig on his head which looks like something one would find in the middle of a cow field.The Boland familly in general were outraged by the production , and the film did extremely well in Ireland , but flopped like a pan cake outside our four green fields.It also suffers from the tendency to point to the indigenous population saying & quot ; Is n't this cool , we 're all so important on this production . Yes I played such and such in the movie & quot ; . I myself turned down any part of it with utter contempt , as I have taken the view that regardless of what side one was on during the Civil War , all concerned were heroes with no villins . Was Robert E. Lee any less in greatness then Grant ? Both men are held with equal respect by the American populace.RTE produced a much rounded and interesting production & quot ; The Treaty & quot ; which deals with the period in a more mature , intelligent way . The great Brendan Gleason appears as Collins , and the equally excellent Barry McGovern as de Valera. & quot ; Michael Collins & quot ; is a total fiasco and an embarrasement	-1
This review is not concerned with the film itself - but rather its presentation on DVD . First of all , the disc is packaged in the much maligned Warner Bros. cardboard snapcase - which is easily damaged and impossible to replace short of simply buying another copy of the title.Secondly , it is a double-sided disc and the film is broken up into two parts . As it always is with films released on DVD in this manner ( GETTYSBURG , SCHINDLER 'S LIST ) the break is quite sudden and disruptive to the movie-watching experience.It 's a shame this title has not been re-released with these issues addressed . There are a multitude of films much longer than MICHAEL COLLINS that have fit onto one single-sided disc ( LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and SEVEN SAMURAI spring to mind ) .Still , it 's a budget priced title and - most significantly - the only manner in which to enjoy the film on DVD as the time of this writing.For the record , the fifty minute documentary that is included on the DVD is rather interesting and much appreciated .	-1
As dull and dry as tumbleweed bouncing through an Arizona desert on the hottest day of the year . Arnie coasts , Vanessa is ice , Caan is the same-old , same-old , Cromwell is slumming ( from & quot ; Babe & quot ; to this ! ) , and the action sequences are straight out of every Schwarzennegar action flick from the past decade ( look for the scene that is the exact duplicate of the one with Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies when she 's holding onto Arnold in mid-air ) .In conclusion : rollin ' , rollin ' , rollin , ' keep dese doggies rollin ' ...	-1
warner continues to issue all of their products with the Nasty , NASTY VC-1 codec because it was easy for them to do it both in Blu-ray and hd-dud . And I can see the differences in their releases and other companies who use the FAR more superior AVC . They even stick only to the antiqued douby-digital ! Never have I seen a release with a DTS track in any of warners stuff , and it rubs me raw because I usual see the DTS mark at the end of the credits in most of the movies ! ! !	-1
At the risk of receiving hundreds of threatening e-mails , I will go on record stating that Ridley Scott 's dystopian vision stands as one of the most unjustifiably praised films since the invention of sound . While technically marvelous and full of visual invention ( it does use noir influences effectively ) , the story drags on endlessly and the characters , especially Ford 's , remain aloof , uninteresting , and frustrating . As an exercise in style , it has undoubted appeal , but it must be heavily criticized at the screenplay level . When a story is in service to the visuals , it reflects a lack of confidence at the narrative level . I have never found Ford to be an appealing actor ( he is far too bland to be a commanding leading man ) , but at no other time has his character been so devoid of passion or insight .	-1
I resubmit this review as a service to DVD fans ... Wo n't waste your time with movie analysis , just the DVD complaints:1 . No extras , like commentary , outtakes , etc.2 . No 5.1 sound3 . No DTS4 . Does n't include both versions : with voice over and without.I keep reading a new version is due out . Consensus seems to be wait and see if Warner addresses any of these complaints before buying . That 's what I 'm doing .	-1
the date of this movie is 2007. i wonder when it was originally released ... maybe 1985 ? the tech is so old in this movie it may be older than that . when a movie house digitizes the audio and video they give it a new & # 34 ; Release Date & # 34 ; . i think this practice is bogus . ridley scott directed but , this movie has the tech of the original Alien movie not the second Aliens . that release date of Alien was 1979 i believe . anyway , the movie was soooooo slow such as spending 30sec on a close-up of Ford in a hover craft flying to Hdq w no dialogue or sounds other than a odd bit of music . Akward ! Edward James Olmos was flying that vehicle and he looked like he was 20yrs old . waaaaayyyy before Battlestar Galactica ! they called the & # 34 ; Replicants & # 34 ; ... & # 34 ; Skin Jobs & # 34 ; : ) just too slow ... too old ! !	-1
Blade Runner will always be , at least for coming 5 years , on the top 10 list of best Sci.Fi movies . Shame about the DVD , poor sound and picture ( single layer DVD ) .I have seen much worse movies get released on Superbits , or special edition with DTS , DD ES , duel layer superb picture transferred quality , except Blade Runner.Who is responsible , or who can take the responsibility , to give justice to this exceptionaly good movie and release it in a format that people can watch it with today projectors and sound systems .	-1
VERY DISPOINTING SET HAS THE SAME DVD AVAILABLE ALL READY WITH JUST ONE VERISON , THERE WAS VHS VERSION THAT HAD THE NARRATION AND MORE GRAPHIC SCENES THAT WERE DELETED IN THE THEATRICAL VERSION FOR BEING TO GRAPHIC WHY CANT WE GET THIS VERSION ON DVD WHATS UP !	-1
Okay , on its own merits this is an okay film , but the fact that it completely bastardizes Philip K. Dick 's wonderful Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? , the novel upon which it was based , more or less totally ruined it for me . Virtually all of the rich layers of reality , religious allegory , and *many* significant plot points were completely absent from the film . One of the main characters , Jack Isidore , was entirely eliminated , and the shared messianic experiences and electronic animals were also gone . Also , Rick was married in the novel.If you 're going to see this , you should definitely read the novel as well -- it 's a much richer experience.Neat-o special effects , though .	-1
I had many good things about this movie , but I thought the story rambled and was pointless . Could not stay to the end of this movie . A yawner !	-1
This DVD is a terrible video transfer . I hope some time in the future this great movie gets the attention it really deserves - A DVD set with BOTH versions of the movie , some good extras , directors commentary , and a decent transfer . This is a very poor presentation for an extraordinary movie .	-1
I have to agree with the other critical comments here on this director 's cut . The audio and video quality are no more than so-so , and although that is somewhat explainable because it was one of the first DVD transfers done , I would n't plunk your hard earned cash down for it yet . I 'd wait until a better transfer is available.If you do , you 'll still be rewarded with a great movie . Dick 's vision L.A. is dark , dismal , and fraught with the perils of imperfect science in the shape of the homicidal androids . This future is interesting in that it invites comparison with H.G . Wells 's great classic , The War of the Worlds . Few novels in the history of science fiction portray such a dire , dismal , hopeless , and pretty much depressing fate for mankind throughout the entire novel as Wells 's book does . In many ways , the sci-fi genre was a literature of optimism as it was believed that science could solve all social problems and the future for humans and for society was bright . Wells 's novel is almost unique in pointing out the risks of science and that the universe might be a bigger , more dangerous place than we had thought . Written at the end of the Gay Nineties , Wells 's novel sounds an uncharacteristically cautious and sober note about mankind 's possible future.In Bladerunner , Dick envisions a similarly dark , dismal , depressing , and in many ways , hopeless future . L.A. is even perpetually rainy , which adds to the film noir like atmosphere . We do n't know if this is due to a climate shift or not in the movie , but maybe it 's explained in the book . And like in War of the Worlds , science itself is shown to be a two-edged sword at it sometimes creates more problems than it solves in the imperfect androids , who serve well for a time , but then toward the end of their brief lives run amuck . Furthermore , science is unable to solve the problem and bounty hunters must be dispatched to terminate the androids when they do.Besides the androids , even the other humans are often shown as unprepossessing . The great scientist Tyrell is the ultimate nerd with literally coke-bottle lens glasses . And the dowdy technician , Sebastian , who takes the androids in , has some sort of skin disease that ages his face prematurely . He admires the andoids physical perfection since it contrasts with his own imperfection . And the psychologist who gets killed at the beginning of the movie when he gives the android the test seems smarmy and somewhat arrogant.One of the few positive characters , besides Harrison himself , is Sean Young , the beautiful , young android who does n't even know she is an android . Her design is supposed to fix the problem , perhaps because she 's ignorant of her own origins.Anyway , Dick 's vision of the future reminded me of the great Wells classic from 1897 in its similarly dark , dismal , and depressing picture of the future.One final comment , if I remember right , Dick was married and divorced several times , and to the dismay of his former wives , there is often a shrewish woman in his stories that is no doubt intended to resemble his former spouse . I did n't see anyone like that in this movie , except perhaps for the Darryl Hannah android character perhaps , who is n't quite the same , but anyway , Dick was an interesting writer whose dyspeptic and dystopian visions of the future and on the dangers of science stood in contrast to much of the sci-fi genre .	-1
I only saw Blade Runner because it 's my dad 's favorite movie , and I got it for him for Father 's Day . Anyhow , we ordered pizza and sat down to watch the Director 's Cut of Blade Runner . As the movie started , I was like & quot ; okay , this is n't so bad after all , & quot ; but I quickly took back my optimistic thought process . It was a depressing 2-dimensional action/sci fi flick about ... well , what was it about ? I do n't know if anybody 's sure about it . Another mystery.Anyway , Rachael , the replicant object of Deckard 's affection , has no personality whatsoever . I seriously wonder how he fell in love with her . Maybe he 's a replicant too ... and , miraculously , that 's the amazing question the movie is asking . There is some deep meaning in this film . Is it that Deckard is perhaps a replicant too ? Wow . Too hard to handle , for me at any rate.Most of the film I did n't get , including the white-haired replicant guy who ran around howling with a nail through his hand . He was extremely creepy , if not completely repulsive . The only part in the movie that I enjoyed was the 10-second-long vision of the unicorn . At least I think it was a vision . It was neat , but I 'm not sure how it fit into the story . I also liked the end , because it was not really an ending at all , and because that meant the torture was over . But I suppose this all has to do with some mind impediment that I suffer from . After all , I 'm just a moron with no taste for sci fi flicks , except of course for the coolest movie ever , Star Wars . Well , I guess if you 're like my dad , you 'll enjoy Blade Runner . And if you appreciate real plots and characters with emotions , then you wo n't like this movie at all .	-1
I am a huge fan of Sci-Fi . Not to the point where I can tell you the name of the chick 's aunt who played Cordelia 's third stake in Episode 4,000,258 B of Buffy , but I like the genre just the same , and some of my all-time favourite flicks ( Star Wars , Alien , The Fifth Element ) are true-blue Science Fiction.Imagine my disappointment , then , upon renting this Director 's cut version of Blade Runner , and discovering that not only is it one of the most boring Sci-Fi movies ever made , it 's also pretentious and overstated to the point where you really do n't care if you never see the end.With a potentially excellent premise - the plot , on paper , is exciting and detailed ) and a decent ensemble cast ( with Sean Young doing what she seems to do best , playing emotionless characters ) , Ridley Scott and Vangelis manage to totally negate any character sympathy we might feel through over-the-top panorama shots , long , drawn-out cityscape sequences , and the most awfully Eighties-Fantastic soundtrack ever . Cliches like the Bar sequence abound , and are we really expected to believe Daryl Hannah in her role as the grating , whiney Pris ? At least Splash was mute for a part of that movie ... One of the most annoying features of this film is the performance given by the usually excellent Harrison Ford . I can imagine Ridley Scott telling Ford to play the role as Indiana Jones-without-Humanity , and that 's exactly how he comes across . Boring and wooden , as the central character in a movie whose basic premise is the conflict between humanity and machines , his character is the major flaw in a film full of boring , OTT cliches and unengaging dialogue.One for the Vaults , may it languish there forever more . There are far , far superior examples of Science Fiction available .	-1
This DVD was supposed to be encased in a steel box/case as pictured and promised ; not so . I did not have the time to undo the shipping required for refund or reorder due to this purchase being a birthday gift .	-1
I read that this was the greatest sci-fi movie ever made . I love sci-fi but this movie sucked ! People say it has `` intensely packed action '' . It almost put me to sleep . The themes could have made a good movie but this is a disjointed mess . It takes place where the sun does n't shine , literally , and it rains all the time . Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer do OK with the script they 're given . The writing and directing are the problem . It 's VERY SLOW ! Wan na buy my copy ? Total Recall and iRobot draw the good points from this movie . Get those instead !	-1
put the original version on dvd with harrison fords commentary . it 's part of the movie . it 's great . all you hear is dead silence on the directors cut . i guess we have no choice .	-1
I would guess that just about every film ever made has production flaws also known as `` goofs '' on the IMDB . Blade Runner is no exception . However as another reviewer had stated `` I thought is was a classic back in 1982 '' , I would strongly agree . The updated 25th version production crew did an excellent job regarding correcting the flaws , but it is a totally different film than the original 1982 version . This is my list of complaints : 1 ) The digital scanned print made the 25th version look synthetic and digital not analog , 2 ) The colors were very saturated ( 1982 film stock does not look this way ) , 3 ) The interview production footage did not fit with the mood of the original film . It had a boring set design and to much emphasis was put on the cast and production crew members talking . I would have prefered voice overs with stills and actual production footage . Every extra on every DVD produced that I 've seen uses the same interview format . Very unoriginal . The extra items in the case like the Spinner model , the Origami unicorn etc . were cheap and not worth the wait . I would have prefered a solid production book with quality stills of never before published production images . I think that what makes something a classic is the human component and `` flaws '' within the subject or object . The original should have been left alone . What 's next , removing brush hairs from the canvas of a Dali painting because they do n't belong there ?	-1
Harrison Ford becomes a screen legend off of Han Solo and Indiana Jones and then he does this futuristic toilet of a movie . The story did n't make any sense and it was just a bad movie , you should n't combine film noir with sc-fi , no Maltese Falcon with the Jetsons , or it just did n't work with this movie . Ridley Scott directs great films like Gladiator and Alien , then directs this wasteland of a flick that should n't be apart of the future with or without flying cars . any one who think this is better than Star Wars than get the hell off Amazon . Hollywood Homocide might treat you to better Harrison Ford films . If you want good futuristic movies rent Minority Report or I , Robot . Make a better future by getting rid of `` BAD RUNNER '' Harrison , do n't think less of you because this crap you did .	-1
This is a brainless film . Seriously , if you have anything approaching a decent IQ , avoid it . The plot seems like it was put together by monkeys pulling cliche after cliche out of a box.Early CG effects hold up decently . The gas tanker is probably the worst of the bunch , but still- good work there guys.Several likable actors . I do n't know who to blame for this waste of time . I guess I 'll choose the director for poor performances from the cast and the script writers for one of the worst plots ever .	-1
People , if it ai n't remastered , it 's only going to be a moderate improvement , compared to standard def , unless it animation or shot in high def already . You wan na ' see spectacular , get Blade Runner special edition in Blue Ray ... OMG ... now that 's something to see and WORTH ! ! ! ! ! my dollars . I 've yet to see anything made more than ten years ago come even close to that title . Twister is one of my all time favs that can be watched at least twice a year . I may get this in BR ; but , that 's an exception . As far as I 'm concerned , the movie industry is only porting most of their products in to BR , without much concern about quality , to get more money in their pocket , knowing full well that the end result could be much ... much better if they took the time to remaster each and EVERY title to maximize the end result . For what they are charging we fans , this should be standard practice .	-1
Dont even watch Twister . Its kind of cool the first time you watch it but then it gets really boring . Its just about tornados .	-1
This movie a couple of years ago was the first one that set the path for BIG NATURE CATASTROPHY movies with DARN EXPENSIVE special effects and MINIMAL common sense and TEPID actor performances . The visual effects send shivers down your spine , but unfortunately they make up only max . 30 minutes of the movie , so meanwhile you can take a nap , because sluggish romance between main characters is not persuasive , but there is nothing else in the movie , besides counting scenes that in real life would have killed our heroes : Well , if you do n't know that NOTHING can survive after being crushed into the core of a tornado ( yes , even if Ms. Hunt clutches the buttress of a bridge VERY TIGHTLY ) , you should watch CNN or DISCOVERY channel more often . From the point of view of true-to-life movie , & quot ; Volcanoe & quot ; was much better..	-1
The one-dimensional characters were out of a cartoon book . What a disappointment ! You would think that with Helen Hunt , there could be some character depth . But the & quot ; B & quot ; team was out in spades in this stinker - even the guy whose dad owned the expensive car in & quot ; Ferris Buehler 's Day Off & quot ; was given a speaking part . And with Bill Paxon - well , you just know there 's going to be a lot of hurt and angry looks , and a lot of running around , and no character development . And Cary Elwes of & quot ; The Princess Bride & quot ; showed up as the & quot ; Bad Guy. & quot ; Someone came across these guys waiting tables and took pity on them . But at our expense . Shame ! Next time give us some real actors with a real plot .	-1
This movie was n't bad but it was n't great either . And the fact that it won the Oscar for best picture tells me that the competition that year was extremely weak . But it was n't . This movie beat out `` A Few Good Men '' which is a travesty . It is one of those movies where you really know nothing about the main characters for 1 hour 45 minutes and then the final 15 minutes of the film is for the big reveal .	-1
Be sure you understand that his has captions all the way thru the movie , and , it covers much of the viewing area on the screen . Absolutely dumb to restrict the viewing area of the movie . Plenty of F this and F that right from the start which makes this movie undesirable and 'unforgivable ' . Simply no need for the trash talk .	-1
Coming October 18th are special editions of Batman , Batman Returns , Batman Forever , & Batman and Robin .	-1
Am I missing something ? Please write and tell me if I am , because I ca n't understand why people admire this movie . As far as I can tell , this is what happens in `` A Time To Kill '' : Carl Lee 's daughter is raped and left for dead , and her white tormentors are captured . Before they face trial , Carl kills them . Why ? They would not be convicted , because as we all know a white southern jury could n't possibly set aside its racism . Carl is then acquitted by a white southern jury that sets aside its racism . The film urges us to celebrate this verdict as some kind of race-relations watershed . But beneath the back-slapping , soaring music and soft focus , the take home message is this : `` There is a time to kill . If you think the justice system wo n't give you justice , then revenge killing is a noble option . '' Not only is this one of most appallingly idiotic dictums ever conceived , it betrays an appreciation of the justice system which is , at best , infantile.Let 's apply a little common sense here . What the white rapists did was wrong , and they should be punished for it . What the black father did was wrong , and he should be punished for it , too . Cases closed . Yes , we can empathize with Carl . Yes , put in the same position we might even do the same thing ourselves . No , that does n't make it right . Even if you think Carl was rightly acquitted , the film defeats its own argument : the fact that Jake Brigance gets a white jury to recognise and set aside its inherent racism ( `` now imagine she 's white '' ) demonstrates that Carl 's fears were unjustified . There was no need to take the law into his own hands after all - a black man can get justice from a white court . However , I think a more realistic interpretation of the outcome is that a dumb jury can be sweet-talked by a pretty-boy lawyer into acquitting a guilty man they feel sorry for . And what kind of 'justice ' is that ? Do n't ask screenwriter Akiva Goldsman - this is just another one of his sci-fi scripts . Nor director Joel Schumacher - here , as in his equally insulting `` Batman '' films , he seems more interested in visually molesting his male star than in telling a decent story , and clearly spent most of his time contriving ways to get Matthew McConaughey 's shirt off or setting up lingering butt shots.This film was pitched as an exciting suspense-thriller , nicely cast with a mix of heavy-weights and newcomers , and having the guts to explore some serious social and moral issues . For me , it 's a vile and contemptible little film peddling an equally repulsive morality . What the hell Spacey , Bullock and the Sutherlands are doing here is beyond me . It 's a blot on all their resumes . Go back to your old job as a window dresser , Joel . On the evidence of this film , pretty and pretentious facades are what you 're best at .	-1
I had high hopes for this film based on some of the major talent which is in it . This was obviously a huge production and there is no lacking of `` big names '' . But this ill-fated project obviously had Mystic River aspirations while only having Cagney and Lacey story-line horsepower.In fact , I 'm incredulous that all these people agreed to be in this because I presume the hollowness of the story was apparent from even a brief scanning of the script.Soon into the film I realized it was lacking in any nuance or new insights . From 30 minutes in I could have written the balance of the script . Beyond predictable , it is painfully cliche and bloated in every way imaginable.The hillbilly rapists are totally despicable and repulsive , with no redeeming or mitigating qualities at all . Would n't the story have been better served by some tension as to whether these monsters deserved to die ? Here there was no question at all.Matthew Mc . is a stuggling idealist attorney who is in financial trouble , and who has a sassy but dedicated older secretary who is trying to keep the office financially afloat ; taking on a new case of this nature does n't help the cash flow situation at all , and hardships ensue ... .did n't we see exactly that scenario in `` Anatomy of a Murder '' fifty years ago ? He has some dandy of a friend who wears striped suits whose role is unclear throughout.All the courtroom machinations are as predictable as gravity , and unrealistic to the core : The grumpy judge of questionable ethics and motivations . The politically motivated DA . The last minute arrival of important evidence and the unfair surprise attack on defense witnesses . These characters and events are all tired cliche . Yawn.The Donald Sutherland `` role model '' character seems to again come from `` Anatomy of Murder '' where an old alcoholic lawyer guided a younger attorney with his words of wisdom and various anecdotes . Here the Sutherland character adds nothing . The Sanda Bullock `` true believer '' character adds little as well . Matthew 's wife is totally righteous and beautiful , and any sexual tension between Matthew and Bullock is unfortunate , not appealing.The racial commentary here is unfortunately banal and unconstructive . Matthew was more hip to the plight of the father-defendant than his client gave him credit for being . In fact , given the circumstances of the attack on the girl , almost any jury would applaud the father for killing the perpetrators rather than convicting him for that action . This defendant , at a minimum , would have a `` heat of passion '' defense , which would drop him down to two counts of mere manslaughter . He also would have an insanity option . But the biggest obstacle to the prosecutor would be the fact that what this man did , as the father of a young girl who was brutally gang raped , was quite simply overwhelmingly understandable . People would empathize with his actions . Most fathers would do the same thing , if they possibly could . To suggest otherwise was bogus , even in Mississippi . The accidental shooting of the sheriff , during the revenge killings , was far more interesting in terms of reasonable outcome . Even with that man 's forgiveness , the revenge should have been served without collateral damage to innocent people . The appropriate verdict as to the shooting of the deputy was by far the most interesting legal and moral question in this movie , in my view , and I did like the way they handled it.Most painful of all was Matthew 's closing argument ( alert : paraphrased spoiler ) : `` ... .Then , ask yourself what if she was WHITE ! '' Wow , is that a unique approach ! I 'd never thought of that distinction before ! That really drives the point home ! He got me there , great question , very transcendent and metaphysical ! By golly I 'd never thought of it that way , this guy is good ! -- is that what the jurors were supposed to think ? I think jurors would have already asked themselves that -- like two minutes into the trial . The dynamics of the rape and the revenge shootings were pretty obvious , and I do n't think this pithy little inquiry added any new insight at all . I ca n't recall a movie where the `` denouement '' is so shockingly anticlimactic . Overall : the entire culmination is unbelievably weak , given what must have been a vast budget for this film . I would have chipped off Donald Sutherland or Bullock and used the money for a real writer.Then , Matthew and family are cool enough that they go over to black family 's house for a BBQ after all the dust has settled . Darned decent of them , very open ! A new era in race relations for sure ! Painful , trite , insipid . The movie made it seem as if this were an open and grand gesture when it seemed virtually inevitable to me ; the two families at this point are now forever bonded by blood for all intents and purposes , are n't they ? ? I 'd presume they 'd be lunching together twice a week and bowling on Thursdays for the next twenty years after what they went through together.This movie is a glaring blemish in the careers of all involved . It just resonates way too shallow and offers no realistic or new insight into the types of issues it portrays . One exception , perhaps , would be Keifer Sutherland , who I thought displayed a very convincing manic hatred which you would imagine coming from a KKK lunatic . I give one star for him alone.This movie , overall , is on the same literary level as the statement authored by one Rodney King almost two decades ago : `` Ca n't we all just get along ? '' Good question , important point . I thought Rodney 's simple question was more to the point and more authentic than this pompous , preachy , politically correct 2.5 hours of budget-bloated bombast .	-1
I 'll begin by saying that I bought this edition of IWTV from Amazon and returned it the same week . That might tell you how disppaointed with it I was . Why ? First of all , the picture quality is actually poorer than the previous DVD edition ( the non-DTS version ) . The copy Iwatched was actually grainy ( ! ) , whereas the other version was very , very clean.Secondly , the special feautres . The list looks quite impressive , and was another reason I bought this version having already bought the first DVD release . The sound is the only decent thing about this disk . The Interview Gallery , the Documentary , and the Introduction ( listed as 'A Special Introduction ' on the sleeve ! ) are all culled from the SAME interview clips . I mean , what the hell ? ! What a complete waste of money , and what a huge disappointment for a fan . The Introduction was just laughable . I expected to see Ann Rice and Neil Jordan sitting together saying Hi , Enjoy the movie . But no . It 's just three of the interview clips ( they include one of Antonio Banderas too ) that are used in the Documentary . Please ! It was laughable - ... Now that 's funny.What a piece of garbage . At least the original edition did n't purport to be special.Avoid .	-1
I 'm a Blu-ray enthusiast , and a Lethal Weapon enthusiast . So , I was VERY disappointed in both the quality of the Blu-ray formatting for this ( it looks like DVD quality ) , but what REALLY mad me upset is the fact that it 's not the directors cut . I guess that perhaps it was a bit naive of me to assume that it would be , but come on , this is BLU-RAY we 're talking about here ! I was not impressed . Not to mention that the seller said it was in `` Good Condition '' , but the spine and back of the sleeve was severely crumpled and torn . Had this been a good quality Blu-ray conversion , and it been the directors cut , I would have cared not regarding the crumpled sleeve . However , as it was not the case , the crumpled nature was the straw.P.S . I just checked on Amazon , and there 's STILL no Director 's Cut available . Until there is , I will not be buying any Lethal Weapon films on Blu-ray .	-1
I love this movie since its release back in 1987 . If you ask me I give it 5 STARS but not for the Blu-ray edition as well the DVD edition , those are 0 star , but I had to put something 'cause I 'm supposed to rate the movie . This review is not about the movie but about the censorship that has been prevailing since it 's first release on DVD . And again it 's the same on the Blu-ray edition . I 'll make the long story short : Gary Busey ( Mr. Joshua ) enters Sgt . Murtaugh 's house and there 's Scrooge in a movie on TV asking what day it is and Mr. Joshua screams : `` It 's f ... ing Christmas ! `` , but the audio is altered with noise and the only thing one hears is `` Christmas '' . The VHS edition of the movie has the original audio . And at the end of the movie when Lt. Murtaugh ( Danny Glover ) says : I 'm too old for this sh.. '' , the last word is edited , something that does n't happen in the VHS edition . Can someone tell me why ? Has Disney once again stuck its finger in a movie ? I look at the box , it says Warner . So , after all the killing and blood they want to make it PG 13 or what ? I 've heard much worse things in other movies , `` sick MF '' , `` SOB '' , etc.Studios , leave movies how they are , originally intended , do n't mutilate movies with visual and , in this case , audio censorship . Is the ghost of William Harrison Hays lurking around ? It 's like the James Bond movies . I used to love Sean Connery smoking and drinking . Daniel Craig 's Bond does n't smoke , hardly drinks ... come on , can you imagine Sgt . Martin Riggs not smoking , not drinking and not cursing ? It will be a Mary Poppins movie.I wo n't deny the quality of the image of the movie is better , hell , it 's got ta be , we 're talking Blu-ray here and I even bought it . But , ... I still keep my VHS version of the movie .	-1
There are some parts of this movie that do n't check for me.One major issue is that the screen writer clearly has an understanding for how race plays out in film , yet still deliberately creates a movie that is racially insensitive . Typically , media is viewed seriously for subtle racist messages , and unfortunately , this movie fails although appearing to be just the opposite.Costner is presented as the hero for which the movie can not do without . He has a whole cast of sidekicks to help him to complete the task including the black limo driver that he recruits by informing him that if he does n't become his side kick he will be killed because the `` cocky black soffer '' always dies by being in attentive . The driver is a racial stereotype of a young lazy black man that has to be directed by a white superior . The writer clearly understands that these racist roles are created for blacks but chooses to recreate bad roles for African Americans . I do not know why.The depiction of black women in this movie is also extremely poor . Whitney Houstan is not just spoiled ; she is sexually irresponsible . She is a stereotype of a successful African American female . In one screen she almost has sex with the man plotting to kill her because she is angry at her boyfriend Costner , and wants to make him jealous . Her character is immature . Her sister is so sexually dysfunctional that she attempts also to sleep with Costner even though she knows that she would be sleeping with her own sister 's lover . I have an issue with this . Not only does it reproduce patterns of male domination ( females can not be trusted ) it also depicts black females as being sexually immoral . Like Houstan , her camera sister is extremely immature and needs the guidance of a white male played by Costner.The character of Rachel leaves much to be desired as far as a woman is concerned . She is inconsiderate and abuses the people that work for her . She also sexually harasses Costner and than tantrums on her own employee when he stops sleeping with her . We are supposed to view that in line with her Leo character type , but her character is really just immature . It does n't make sense either since a singer as successful as the one she is playing would have to have a lot of discipline . The portrayal was just unfortunate.Costner 's character is the usual white male come to fix problems all the problems of irrational ( black ) people . That Costner must in fact fix the mess made by these two sisters is reaffirmed when Rachel 's sister ends up being the one behind the murder plot . It is really just pitifully prejudice . Blacks can not have legitimate threats against them without them really being about killing each other . Rachel 's sister is jealous , murderous , and caddy . The actress cast is one of the most beautiful minority women but she is in the role of a criminal that would kill her own sister over petty jealousy . The story is really ridiculous , and sad to point out , but it is a racist movie.I like Costner , but his character also needs tuning . He is emotionally constipated to the point of being abusive . He beats up some man just for giving him lip . He also jilts Houstan after sleeping with her , and this is supposed to some how prove that he is better at his job . It just places him in the position of being in control rather than his female partner . That seems to be the main function of the scenes inclusion ; a white male is always in control no matter how subordinate his position realistically would be.The interracial love story would be interesting if the couple did not break up at the end of the film for no appealing reason . Again , when viewed for a general pattern most of these interracial movies end the same way ; the couple is delegitimized . The Bodygaurd is no exception . The problems with this film could have been corrected easily , by simply making Houstan more mature , removing the jilting scene as it does n't make sense , and not breaking the couple apart at the end of film -- the major change would also be not making another black person really behind the murder plot .	-1
I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of this product . I thought by now , the dvd would 've more enhanced and not so blurry .	-1
I have n't seen this movie in a very long time . My husband and I went to a theater to see it . We both felt like walking out but I wanted to stay in hopes that it would get better . It never did ! Could have been a great movie if they had kept it more realistic . I remember the black people all being represented as very smart and the white people as very dumb . Also the black people did not appear very poor at all . They were seen folding beautiful sheets in a house that was definitelly not a shack . I grew up in a lower middle class family and we never had clothes or sheets that looked so good as what they had . I think the movie did a great disservice to the book .	-1
This movie plays like an incredibly well made , overly long , TV re-enactment . It is based upon the imagination of a moron , filled with exageration , cliche , and caricature . Why anyone would waste their time with this is beyond me .	-1
Since I consider Martin Scorcese 's & quot ; Goodfellas & quot ; the greatest gangster film ever made and one of the all time great motion pictures , it breaks my heart to give the DVD issue only one star ( almost feel like Henry Hill ratting on his friends ) .What could the & quot ; geniuses & quot ; at Warner Home Video been thinking ? The DVD is two sided , which means it has to be flipped in order to watch the 2nd half and there are NO special features to speak of except for a couple of trailers and a few production notes.For a movie like & quot ; Goodefellas & quot ; ( a film that boasts absoutely brilliant acting , writing , directing , cinematography , and soundtrack ) to get such slipshod DVD treatment is inexcusable.How about it Warners ? A & quot ; Special Edition & quot ; re-issue including commentary by Scorcese and/or Nick Pileggi ; interviews with the stars , deleted scenes , and maybe the ENTIRE movie on ONE side.If it 's not in the stores by the end of the Summer , we may have to ask Tommy , Jimmy and Henry to pay you a visit !	-1
NOTE : THE TWO STARS IS FOR THE DVD , NOT THE MOVIE . THE MOVIE DESERVES 5 STARS.Yes , this review does n't really concern the movie . Just know that `` Goodfellas '' is one of my favorite Mafia movies . Everything about the movie is superb , and it deserves 5 stars all the way . So please , DO NOT THINK THAT THIS REVIEW IS ATTACKING THE MOVIE , because it 's not.What this review IS attacking is this terrible DVD . I did n't know I was buying a smaller version of a laserdisk . Why does the movie have to be on two sides ? ? ? I do n't get it . Yeah , it might be a long movie , but they were able to fit `` Casino '' all on one side . So what 's up with that ? There better be a special or collector 's edition coming out soon , because this movie needs one bad . Not just because it 's a classic and a masterpiece , but because it needs to be on ONE side ! When I buy a DVD , I expect just that.Other than the movie being on both sides , the DVD really lacks in special features , the picture quality is so-so , and the sound could 've been improved in some parts.Again , `` Goodfellas '' is a masterpiece in my mind , and it deserves 5 stars . But the DVD is just awful . In fact , calling the DVD `` awful '' is being too polite.Warner Bros. : Come out with a special edition , for crying out-loud ! ! ! If you love this movie , do n't get the DVD . Just get it on VHS and wait until a better version comes out . TRUST ME on this one . Unless they have updated the movie and placed it all on one side . If that 's the case , please let me know and I will have to re-buy it.I will write a real review for the movie in the VHS section sometime soon.Again , the low rating is for the DVD ; NOT the film .	-1
Walter Cronkite came up with probably the most accurate assessment of this Oliver Stone fiasco : he called it `` a bill of goods . '' More fully , Stone plays recklessly with a pivotal and defining tragedy in American history by putting virtually everyone in the `` grassy knoll , '' from the slain President 's successor and even to LBJ 's successor , Richard Nixon . Along with them is the nation 's entire intelligence community , from the CIA and FBI to most every known anti-Castro Cuban-American . `` JFK '' is nothing more than a dangerously misleading packaging of virtually every assassination theory ever developed . For anyone who hopes for any credible reason for the insanity in Dallas Nov. 22 , 1963 , they 're not going to find it here . Instead , we 're left with the dangerous and ( at least because of the lack of evidence cited ) unfounded impression that literally everyone in government service was part of the probable conspiracy that ended the Kennedy Administration . Granted , this is only entertainment . But its subject is too important to play as dangerously loose as Stone does with known facts . Pass this one up .	-1
First , as a movie , you ca n't do better than JFK . In fact , it would be hard to do better than Stone , period , in terms of movie making . This guy is a fantastic director ( and writer ) - imaginative , original , courageous and much more . This movie will absolutely keep you riveted to your seat . In many ways , like Stone 's `` The Doors '' ( a five star effort ) , it will blow your mind . Stone 's creativity , compared to the crap spewing out of Hollywood these days , is truly remarkable.So , why two stars ? The allegations this movie makes ( and do n't be fooled by Stone 's baloney that the movie gives multiple points of view - Stone 's point of view , not subtly delivered , is that the U.S. government whacked Kennedy ) are so absurd , when compared to the actual facts , as to be comical . The completely unfunny part is that many in our illiterate society - particularly the young - will take this crap as real history . The threads of coincidences , etc . which Stone , through nut-case Garrison 's character ( well played , as usual , by Costner ) , tries to morph into facts are so blatantly ridiculous ( if you have taken any time at all to read about or study the Kennedy assassination ) that your mind may be blown in this respect , also.To hear Stone tell it at the time of the movie 's promotion , Kennedy was killed and the Warren commission illegally and under-handedly threw out the lone gunman as fact and no one in positions of responsibility ever challenged that conclusion ( an assertion Dan Rather did a great job of exposing as false in an interview with Stone ) . It would be easy , but probably boring , to point out all of the absurdities in this film - for they are legion . So , my advice would be to 1 ) enjoy the flick , but give it no more credence as history than you would The Wizard of Oz ; 2 ) if you are interested in the Kennedy Assassination , refer to the plethora of great books , documentaries , etc. , which are available from all points of view ; last , as with all things Oliver Stone , consider the source . He is a genius in many ways , but not one who has ever been a champion of truth ... oh , and that Joe Pesci - HOLY COW !	-1
Roger Ebert comments on JFK in his The Great Movies . His writing has moved me to raise my rating of this film ( to 2 stars ) .Roger Ebert acknowledges that the content of JFK is trash , as far as the facts go , but that one should view the film not as a telling of what happened during and after that fateful day , but on an emotional level : How we felt about what happened.Ebert even mentions Gerald Posner 's book Case Closed in his review , a book that fully accounts for all the `` unexplained '' aspects of the assassination , although Ebert apparently missed Posner 's explanation of the alleged 3 shots in 2.6 seconds ( they were fired in 5 seconds , based on the open microphone acoustics revealed in the book ) .So enjoy the film , if you must , but only on the level of `` emotion . `` If you want to find out about the JFK assassination and the subsequent investigations , read Gerald Posner 's Case Closed .	-1
After checking out a myriad of & quot ; must haves & quot ; in DVD , I bought the recommended , and after having enjoyed the theatrical release , and credits , watched terrible dialogue and sloppy moments throughout . After the terrific credits the film is just flim-flam despite photography and actors . Just style ! ! ! ... a remake of regurgitated ideas from & quot ; Taxi Driver & quot ; /the detective side . Stick with & quot ; Law & amp ; Order & quot ; on any night . Loved the credits ! ! ! Considering it was in New York , when can you simply travel to the desert in 1/2 hour ... ... ... . ? Or give a dinner party , and then explain to the guest AFTER dinner that your apartment is over a subway ?	-1
I thought Morgan Freeman ( Ironically a Cheater himself years later in real Life ) and Brad Pitt ( on a roll ) did their part good , the story is unique but overall I found the movie disturbing and over the top when it came to the mayhem , on top of that you have Kevin Spacey ( someone I detest and always plays the bad guy so it is fitting ) . My problem does n't lay with the story but the way it carries itself in total disgust .	-1
I was in angst how to rate this film ... my knee-jerk reaction was to give it 5 stars because of the realistic portrayal of a sick serial killer and the incredible acting by every member of the cast . The film was finely filmed and put together and the acting was flawless , but on the overall star meter I have to ask myself , & quot ; Would I ever recommend this film to anybody , anywhere , under any circumstances ? & quot ; And the resounding answer is & quot ; No ! & quot ; I saw it a few years ago when so many people made such a big deal on how good it was . And good it was indeed , but it has to be one of the most sick , disturbing films I have ever seen . I continued to ask myself , & quot ; Why ? & quot ; Why would anyone feel compelled to make a movie like this ? It offers no solutions , no social redeeming values , it does n't educate , it just reviles and sickens and brings out the worst in humanity . I 've seen some sick & amp ; twisted films before , but never have I felt so covered with mind filth as when I finished watching this horrific nightmare of a tale that is too real in light of today 's violent society.Kevin Spacey is bone-chilling as he portrays the sick serial killer who is out to dispense judgement to those who commit the seven deadly sins . His twisted , perverted mind is very like that of a real serial killer who has their own perception of right and wrong , not realizing how deceived they 've become.The search to find the killer keeps you on your toes , but the ending is very predictable and the movie itself is a disgusting heap of violence , blood , sinew and twisted sexual perversion . I have got images dancing around in my head since seeing this film that I can not remove . If I had known how awful this experience would have been , I would have avoided the film altogether.Film students and horror & amp ; mystery buffs may still enjoy it ( especially if they have cast iron stomachs ) and fans of Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey will not be let down by their masterful performances -- BUT I feel compelled to warn anyone who has yet to see this film ... THINK , think very long and hard if this is a film you feel like you can not live without seeing . Frankly , I would have been better off as a human being had I not seen it , and I certainly could never watch this again . To say the least , this is not a film for kids ... but in my opinion , it 's not a film for people of any age .	-1
This film is absolutely gross . It has some of the most disturbing imagery in any modern film . People who are chained to beds and over days have parts of them gradually cut of and the like.Some horror films have elements of the absurd or are poorly constructed so that the repellent features do n't seem real . Seven is one of the most well crafted skillfully scripted films made in recent times so that it is absolutely effective.The atmospherics and skill with which it is made cover over the plot holes . I saw the film and found that the imagery kept coming back for weeks and made me feel sick . However if you like that sort of thing there is no question it is effective .	-1
See my review for BATMAN . This is more of the same , only even worse . However , it has Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman . She single-handedly elevates this into almost worth watching . I still love her , even though this and FRANKIE AND JOHNNY are her two really good roles ... and THE RUSSIA HOUSE .	-1
Firstly , I hate golf and find it utterly boring . Boring is also a word that can be applied to Kevin Costner who , as far as I am concerned , has n't done ANYTHING of value since & quot ; Dances with wolfes & quot ; . Rene Russo is a good actress , stuck here with absolutely nothing to do . And if this is a romantic comedy , where is the comedy ? Please , do n't expose me to this movie again ! ! ! !	-1
Boring , contrived movie . Always aware that this is a movie that has been heavily scripted . Nothing really seems natural or organic ; the action , dialogue , situations , etc. , all seem quite contrived and scripted ... and mostly in an unoriginal and bland manner . These people who rave high praise about this movie must be easily entertained . If you must watch this , do so while doing something else you need to do at the same time so you at least wo n't feel cheated out of your time .	-1
Batman , what happened ? This film and its sequel are classic examples of when the studio gets involved . After the breakout success and positive reviews of the first film , which was dark and moody , the sequel was given mixed reviews but was still a success . Just not as big as the first . Burton did have a story treatment in mind for a third film , coincidentally also involving the Riddler , but Warners did n't want him to return . Instead , we get Joel Schumacher , who claimed he 's wanted to do an adaptation of Batman : Year One and claims to be a fan of the character . In my opinion , if this was so , he would n't have put nipples on the Bat-suit ( saying he was inspired by statues of the Greek gods ) and , even though he probably was pressured into it , making the film more like the 60s Adam West series ( though a favorite of mine , in this day and age , the campy image can not work ) . I do like Val Kilmer as Batman/Bruce Wayne , as we actually get to see more of Wayne outside the costume and his emotional struggle to have a romance with Nicole Kidman . Chris O'Donnell would n't have been my first choice to play Robin . He complains to much and comes across more as a brat . And when he 's trying to leave Wayne Manor after Gordon leaves him there , Wayne is practically begging Grayson to stay ( no offense to anyone but Batman and Robin have been trying to escape the whole gay thing since the 1950s and putting that kind of innudendo and having a gay director at the helm does n't help the matter ) . Billy Dee Williams ' ( who played Harvey Dent in the first film ) has been paid off ( a clause in his contract stated he could return as Two-Face ) and is replace by Tommy Lee Jones , who plays the character way over the top . This is where the animated version tops live-action . The characterization ( again Jones played him over the top but the script is to blame as well ) , is way off ; referring to himself in the plural and repeatedly flipping his coin to get the result he wants instead of being psychologically bound to what the coin lands on . Jim Carrey , though a favorite actor of mine , does n't work as the Riddler for me . Again , this is where the animated version tops live-action . Riddler comes across as a carbon-copy of the Joker . Instead of playing the animated version/comics version of a subtly psychotic criminal genius who ca n't help himself but leave riddles to his crimes , we pretty much get Frank Gorshin 's interpretation ; a highly-energetic giggling `` menace '' ( though Gorshin 's version was clearly more insane than Carrey 's , just listen to that laugh ) . And Riddler 's scheme comes across as something the Mad Hatter would do . If I had done this film , Riddler would 've been the established criminal and Mad Hatter would 've been the obsessed Wayne Enterprises employee ( much like his B : TAS debut episode minus being obsessed Wayne ) . Nicole Kidman is alright as Chase Meridian ( and I can actually believe her as a doctor and I like better in this as this was before she became an over-rated Oscar-winning actor ) , but she keeps on jumping back and forth between Bruce and Batman . In the first two films , Vicki Vale was attracted to Bruce and Catwoman was attracted to both . I do n't think a doctor would have that much fixation . Michael Gough is still good as Alfred and Pat Hingle is actually in this movie ! The story is OK but I think they could 've done better . Two-Face 's attack on Batman in the Batmobile makes no sense as it does n't add to the story ( just an excuse to show some explosions and the car driving up the wall ) and a lot of stuff ( like the Sonar suit [ which , for a prototype , does n't do anything ] , Bat-Wing and Bat-Boat ) come across as nothing more than toy advertisements . The production design of this movie is terrible ! While Burton 's design had more style , this is blown out of proportion . With Burton , Gotham was a dark , mysterious city that Batman could work in and use to his advantage . In this , Gotham is lit up like a Christmas tree and you can see Batman coming for miles away , especially in the Batmobile . Now to the music , Elliot Goldenthal me-wait a minute ! Elliot Goldenthal ? Why does that name sound famil-oh my God ! Its the man who screwed up the Beatles ! So we meet again Mr. Goldenthal , what kind of musical travesty do you have in `` score '' for us this time ? Well for starters , he throws out his musical superior 's ( Danny Elfman ) classic theme which can be interpreted as heroic and dark and we get ... a theme that 's not as memorable . In fact his score is anything but memorable . He just composed a few pieces of music and then tracked his music for the rest of the film . Well , below-par music for a sub-par film .	-1
Strikingly cheesy dialogue , lousy acting , amateurish fight scenes that look like they came from some 1970s TV movies , a bloated and schizoid script that bounces all over the place -- -Joel Schumacher has made what is by far the worst Batman movie in history ! What a shame to waste a fairly decent cast : Nicole Kidman , Val Kilmer , Tommy Lee Jones , Jim Carrey ... why on earth they 'd cast Chris O'Donnell as `` Robin '' ( other than to attract pubescent girls ) boggles the mind , this kid could n't act his way out of a paper bag ! I rented this movie because I wanted to test out a new subwoofer in my home theater system , thank God I did n't buy it.Especially watching the latest installment , the excellent `` Batman Begins '' -- -the sheer incompetence displayed in every aspect of `` Batman Forever '' is just appalling .	-1
Batman [ Val Kilmer ] comes back to face Two-Face [ Tommy Lee Jones ] and The Riddler [ Jim Carrey ] who 've aligned in an attempt to take over Gotham City with a damaging brain device . Along the way , Batman meets Dick Grayson [ Chris O Donnel ] who eventually becomes Batman 's sidekick Robin . While Carrey is a perfect choice for The Riddler and Kilmer is ok as Bruce Wayne/Batman [ Despite having blonde hair ] , This installment in the series suffers greatly from its poor story , Tommy Lee Jones ' annoying performance as Two-Face , Chris O Donnel 's equally annoying performance as the annoying-in-general Robin [ Batman should always work alone ] , and the very campy direction that new director Joel Schumacher decided to take with this sequel . Like the 60 's series , Batman and Robin spew boring one-liners , Robin acts silly , and the whole atmosphere seems too colorful . Another thing that dogs this film down is the horrible score by Elliot Goldenthal [ Elfman should 've been brought back to conduct the score ] . The movie as a whole is overblown and too hollywoodized for a Batman film . Gotham City here looks much too glamorous as opposed to the dark , gothic look of Gotham in the first two films . The action scenes are tolerable at best , But the movie ultimately brings shame to Batman 's legacy . And Nicole Kidman 's Chase Meridian character serves no purpose whatsoever [ Chase was never even a character in the Batman comics before or since ] . If you 're a fan of the 60 's Batman tv show , You might like this movie . But , If you 're like me and prefer a dark version of Batman , Skip this one and especially disregard the next film , Batman and Robin .	-1
I remember me and my brother going to see this movie in theaters when it first came out . My jaw dropped at how bad it was . Batman and Batman Returns are both classics but the sequel went down the tubes when Joel Screwmacher ( of St. Elmo 's Fire fame ) was allowed to take full control of the Batman franchise . It 's not as bad as Batman and Robin but it 's still kind of weak for an installment in the Batman series.Plot : Edward Nigma/Riddler ( Jim Carrey ) plans to destroy Bruce Wayne for ignoring his idea of a mind control device . Two Face is hell bent on destroying Batman for a freak accident that disfigured half of his face . Riddler and Two-Face team up eventually to destroy Batman ( Val Kilmer ) .Opinion : This movie is so far from what Batman is that it 's insane . Tim Burton 's stunning and dark appeal was traded for light and fluffy approach to the series . The Riddler was bent on confusing people with riddles not a machine that drains IQs from unsuspecting victims like this movie has him doing . Jim Carrey 's role is The Riddler is excruciating and Tommy Lee Jones role as Two-Face is more over-the-top than his role in Natural Born Killers . Nicole Kidman is about as wooden as a Lincoln log in her role as Chase Meridian . Val Kilmer as Batman is like having Brendan Fraser or Pauly Shore play James Bond . Val Kilmer is a great actor but he looked like he was sleepwalking through this movie . The action scenes are somewhat decent but thats it . And when Batman walked away from Chase Meridian with a smile on his face after she said that she was in love with Bruce Wayne is the corniest scene ever . Only get this to complete the collection . This movie is one of the reasons why Batman Begins exists .	-1
Batman Forever is cartoonish , silly and filled with shallow performances . Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton as Batman . He turns in a souless performance , a complete walk through . Chris O'Donnell is the only spark of interest in the film as Robin . The rest of the characters include Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler.Under the direction of Joel Schumacher , the Batman entry looks like it 's based on the campy Adam West series rather than the brooding Dark Night of the comics . The emphasis here is on flashy sets and comic one liners . This is the first dent in the Batman series and it only gets worse from here .	-1
'Chariots of Fire ' is a well-known film with a very memorable theme song . I have known about the movie for many years , but have never gotten around to seeing it - until recently . The experience was underwhelming . The main story revolves around two competing track runners from England around the 1910s and 1920s . One of the main problems I noticed early on was the sound quality . Even though I was watching the remastered DVD , the dialogue sounds muddled and confusing . It is difficult to understand what the characters are saying ; its as though the filmmakers used poor microphones when shooting the dialogue.Another major problem was that the story and the characters are not very interesting . It difficult to understand the motives of the characters and what is going on in the story . Perhaps I do n't understand the history surrounding the story , but I found it difficult to get into what the characters were about . The story was supposed to make us feel uplifted , but I did not get that feeling at all . The movie does have some good moments in it though ; the striking soundtrack created some good scenes .	-1
[ Addendum Nov 03 : Grapevine has it that Warner Brothers has finally come around to doing a special editition , widescreen and all , scheduled for release sometime in 2004 . There is a God ... Until then , my current review stands . ] Dedication , duty and the passion for victory , both personal and spiritual . A magisterial score . Olympian triumph in the waning light of Empire . This film has ( or rather had ) it all.It 's a sad but true fact that were this film to be released today it would n't have even been a `` sleeper '' , let alone an Oscar Winner . It would have quietly been passed over for the latest star-vehicle featuring [ enter movie star of the month here ] . Oh , maybe for costumes or art direction , but that 's it . It would 've remained art house or just gone straight to video.From my personal experience vault : I distinctly remember when I walked out of the theater . I was very young , very impressionable , and absolutely astonished by what I saw . Here was heroism of the kind that only knew from myth and fantasy stories . Here were runners peforming like gods , but they were real , which made their victories ( and defeats ) the stuff of legend , yet attainable on Earth . I caught the bug and became a track athlete.Years later , there was a theatrical re-release and I was hesitant about seeing it . It had been a long , long time since I strapped on my running spikes and stared down the lanes of a track . Would the indelible impression the film made on my young heart be now seen as just a childish emotional reaction ? Would the whole story seem dated and , dare I say it , cheesy ? No . It still evoked those feelings of triumph -- this time , I could appreciate the film for its wider themes of glory , prejudice and redemption . It was more than magnificent.And yet in the end , DVD and the powers that be have robbed this fim of its artistry . No widescreen edition for Region1 ? ? ( And according to one DVD vendor in the UK , there IS widescreen , but alas , R2 only ... ) Do they think that Americans do n't go for `` foreign '' films , even Oscar Winners ? How insulting . Until there 's a proper widescreen version -- with or without special features , I 'm not particular but they would be welcome -- I will , sadly , not have this tremendous film in my library.Attention other film lovers : Do n't give in and buy it , no matter how much you love this film . Maybe they 'll catch on ...	-1
I bought this because of all the good reviews but thought it was awful . I love William Holden and all the acting was good , but this movie just did n't have a good story to it . Everyone and everything was evil , except for the one who wanted to help his village , and there was not enough to that to make this an interesting in any way . Who cares about a bunch of bad guys doing constant evil deeds right to the end while it gets none of them anyplace except to do more mayham and die . There was no other story to it . I just could not like any of the characters at all . I did n't even hate them , I just wished I never wasted time watching the movie . These guys were just too one dimensional .	-1
This movie was for my husband for Christmas . I thought it was a DVD , instead it came as a VHS . It would have cost more to send it nback .	-1
real Movies have great casting and scripts to work with . None of these B-movies have any of that . They are not even scary . They are just so badly made and it ; s no wonder that few if any of these actors ever found work again .	-1
I 'll give it an extra star for Tom Jones ' truly amusing role , some good , cartoony effects , and the occasional Burton touch . That said , this is Burton 's worst movie . It does n't know quite what it wants to be , and in the end it is n't much of anything . It 's vaguely entertaining on first viewing but after that its almost nauseating to even think about .	-1
What a bizarre and campy sci-fi scare flick with some real morbidity thrown in ! So do you think I would really find humor in victims getting slowly turned into brightly colored skeletons by those hideous invaders with their death rays and their families ended up bawling at their funeral - even if they happen to be trailer-dwelling rednecks ? ? ? And think severed fingers , hands , and heads are really funny at all ? One amusing moment , however is when some big-wigged bimbo goes prancing into some guy 's house to seduce him with a few grisly scenes thrown in . Not to worry , though - such ugly creatures with those bulging eyeballs and pulsating brains eventually get just their desserts after a whole reign of inducing death and terror on the poor innocent humans , however cartoon-like they may be . A real wacko circus show for the sci-fi ape , nevertheless !	-1
I 've watched & quot ; Mars Attacks & quot ; several times and each time I watch it , I like it less and less . It 's like Tim Burton had a party , invited Jack Nicholson , Annette Bening , Pierce Brosnan , Glen Close and Martin Short and said , Would n't it be funny if we made a camp movie together , something in the sprit of those great Science Fiction films form the 50 's and 60 's ? We 'll patch in a few other stars , oh , say Sarah Jessica Parker , Joe Don Baker , and Jack Black and take a stab at it ... what do you say ? Well , I 'm sure it sounded like a good idea at the time . Put a bunch of likable Hollywood veterans together in a goofy Sci-Fi spoof and people will come . But the script never got beyond the napkin upon which it was probably outlined.The film makes an attempt at dark comedy and fails miserably . Are the aliens supposed to be funny ? Brutal ? Both ? They turn out to be less than humorous . Then there 's the actors . You really do n't care about any of them . Sure , they 're played out as mean-spirited and selfish themselves ... but who cares ? I wound up not caring if any of them lived or died . I think the point was to have these Martians blast each of these miserable SOBs , as we viewers cheered them on , but it did n't seem to matter one way or the other.On the other hand , the Martians are done up really well . The expressions , the eye movements , the flappy little cheek appendages were all done well . But like the recent Star Wars movies , CGI will only carry a film so far . Ultimately , this one fails . On a grading scale from & quot ; A & quot ; to & quot ; F , & quot ; this is a solid & quot ; D. & quot ;	-1
Lots of complaints about this movie having no sound . I had the same problem . How can Amazon still ship these out with lots of customers complaints without any quality control . Did not order a replacement which probably would have the same problem.Will return faulty DVD and they better not deduct return shipping charges from the return credit .	-1
What can I say about this movie ? I guess it just did n't do it for me . I found it dull and unentertaining . I went in expecting to laugh at satire of alien invader films ; instead I got what seemed more of a tribute to cheesy alien movies . There were attempts at humor throughout the film , but with me they missed their mark.I will admit that in general I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton movies . I just do n't GET his weird dark gothic worlds . I did n't think he ruined Batman , but I would n't necessarily have envisioned him that way . This movie , in my opinion is the worst of the Tim Burton movies I 've seen . I almost swore completely off his movies after this , but that would have been a mistake since he does manage to find stories that fit his weird style , like Sleepy Hollow , occasionally .	-1
I did not find this movie at all entertaining . I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton but I though it might make a cute Halloween movie . Did n't do it for me . It also says the `` F '' word and that is not a word I care to listen to or allow my children to listen to in my home . It seems that things that I found fun and entertaining in my youth are no longer fun and entertaining to me . If you are looking for a fun movie to watch as a family I would not suggest this one .	-1
Lets kill every oldest son , nah too jewish.Maybe this has been on cable way too much , or times have changes , but this just is not as funny as i remember it being . True , it could never be made today given the racial sensitivity of our PC era , but some of the jokes are just not all that funny . That said , Slim Pickens is the best part of this whole movie , every scene with him still shines .	-1
... I thought this was funny but now looking at it as an adult , there 's really not much funny about the bathroom humor and racial jokes . In fact , it 's downright insulting and degrading . And it 's not insulting and degrading in a funny way . There 's no way I can recommend this unfunny nonsense .	-1
Newman is almost always good because he was a man of integrity , which fits his character Luke perfectly . The part and the person are one . Here he plays his standard 60s outsider again , and he 's attractive in many ways , and the men come to idolize him . The problem with this film is that is much too long , unfocused , and for many long stretches just not entertaining . Sure there are some cool lines , and some good ole boy dialog , and even some pretty sunrises ( filmed in Stockton CA not Georgia ) . But it is also full of cruelty , beatings , whippings , and this fairly standard prison story becomes , at the hands of the director and writer , something odd with undercurrents of masochism , sadism , martyrdom , and homo-eroticism . It is all very weighty and too much . The barracks scenes are stagey and awkward , as is the embarrassing scene where Luke talks to God ( gospel of Luke , get it ? sheeesh ... ) So in the end the sum of all these parts does not make a very coherent film or a very good one . Below average waste of time with a star just for Newman 's charisma .	-1
Sorry to be the skunk at the garden party , which for some reason seems to be becoming my wont . But if you are to analyze this movie objectively , I think you 'd agree that it pretty much sucks . I know you 're thinking : `` What ? ! ? How can anyone say anything so outrageous ! It 's a *classic* ! '' Hear me out.First , Newman is n't very believable . It 's not just that he 's too good-looking to be on a chain gang . It 's not that he 's a lousy actor . He 's not , he 's a great actor . It 's just that in this movie his acting is lousy . Think of the scene where Luke is broken by the guard after digging a hole and being beaten . Even a high school drama teacher would blush at that kind of overacting . It 's embarrassing.Another annoying thing is the stage play ( placement of actors within the shot ) . The movie was done in the style that I thought had died out by 1967 , but apparently had n't . It 's a stagey , overly-dramatic style that kills any verisimilitude ( it 's also the sole problem I have with `` The Searchers '' ) . A group of people are lined up on one side of the screen while observing the action on the other side . It 's very unrealistic . After seeing this in the jailhouse among the inmates three of four times , I began to expect at any moment that the other inmates , being grouped together like that , would burst into a rendition of `` New York , New York , it 's a Helluva Town ! `` I also did n't like Newman 's character . I know that a movie like this needs to be understood within its own cultural milieu , and 1967 was a very turbulent time , with lots of people feeling good about fighting the Pow-uh in a lot of really stupid ways . But stupid acts of public destruction are just that , not the archetype of an individual 's struggle against the Man.And heavy handed . Jeez . Lying him out on a table like he 's been crucified ? Dressing in white ? Could you *be* more obvious ? Overall , a really obnoxious , poorly-executed and shallow presentation on a number of levels . By the end of the movie , I was cheering for the guard with the mirrored glasses to put an end to both Luke 's misery and my own .	-1
This movie was long and boring . I gave it one star because I like Paul Newman . Whoever came up with this story had nothing better to do . What a waste of time !	-1
The anti-establishment attitude of the Sixties is personified in the lead character of Stuart Rosenberg 's `` Cool Hand Luke . '' While Paul Newman is indeed `` cool '' in every sense of the word in the title role , the film unfortunately fails to recreate that same restless energy and urgency of `` Rebel Without A Cause '' ( 1955 ) - the spiritual predecessor of `` Cool Hand Luke '' from the decade prior.Luke Jackson ( Newman ) is caught vandalizing parking meters early one morning . As punishment for his deed , he is sentenced to a prison farm chain gang for two years . Unsurprisingly , Luke refuses to conform to the norms imposed on him by both the guards and the other prisoners . His defiance turns him into a folk hero among his fellow inmates but the prison staff is less amused by Luke 's antics since his rebelliousness leads to repeated escape attempts from the camp . Defiant to the end , Luke eventually forces a final confrontation between himself and the system he so despises . `` Cool Hand Luke '' is merely a serviceable vehicle for Newman . He turns in his usual stellar performance but the film is just one set piece after another interspersed with some occasional witty dialogue . The film does have some high-points - co-stars George Kennedy and Strother Martin are great and Dennis Hopper , Harry Dean Stanton and Wayne Rogers ably fill their smaller supporting roles . Also , the interplay between Luke and his mother ( Jo Van Fleet ) is genuinely touching and helps to add tremendous emotional depth to Luke 's character . However , `` Cool Hand Luke '' does not take its exploration of conformity , individuality , and reform far enough . What could have been an in-depth and enlightening intellectual analysis of the society around us and our role within it ultimately winds up as just another routine tale of a spirited outsider .	-1
Ok , so i 'm young and probally thats the reason I really could n't get into this film . Maybe , maybe not . To get to the point , this movie really bored me . I rarely fall asleep while watching a film , but this one was given that honor . If you found your grandparents stories boring , then this film will probally not be on your top ten list . If you enjoyed those long , memories grandpa used to tell , then this one should be given a chance . For me , I did n't like it , but whose to say you won't.Watching two older men fight and squabble over things that should most likely have been forgotten the moment they happened does not influence me in any way shape or form . Plus , the fact that a substantially older ( Younger ? ) love interest suddenly moves into the neighborhood rather made me feel patroninzing than thrilled over the turn of events.What transpires could have been funny if there where just a few less age aproppriate jokes peppered throughout . Age appropriate by being so old , that I either did n't understand them or relate.Definatly a rental movie first .	-1
Julia Roberts is Darby Shaw , the kind of brilliant , beautiful and ambitious character that drive potboiler novels like `` The Pelican Brief '' . A law student at Tulane , Shaw rounds off her legal education by sleeping with one of her professors ( Sam Shepard ) and floating a conspiracy theory linking the mysterious deaths of two Supreme Court justices . When Shaw 's theory - blaming powerful land developers for murder - becomes circulated in a legal brief , she finds her life turned upside-down . Friends of hers - all having have read the brief - die and Darby goes on the run . Meanwhile , the president ( Robert Culp , playing a morally bankrupt chief , less a right-winger than merely in sway of the rich ) tries to squelch an FBI led investigation of one of his friends . Tying the mysterious deaths to a top-level cover-up , a Washington Post reporter ( Denzel Washington ) teams up with Darby to crack the case . They follow the trail that takes them across the country and eventually brings them to the home of a dead lawyer.This has to be one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . borrowing elements of more deservedly remembered Alan Pakula movies like `` All the President 's Men '' and `` Parallax View '' , `` Brief '' is utterly contrived . It 's not as inspired as it is clearly dependent on the cynicism of a jaded public for our leaders and the law . When you look past this flick 's slim thrills and its laughable message , nothing left makes sense . The script tosses in a high-priced hitman ( Stanley Tucci ) only to dispatch him quickly . Others eliminate their enemies with well-placed car bombs . ( We 're supposed to believe that guys who are expert in killing people without raising suspicions will rely on big loud car bombs going off on public streets in front of everybody , and of course they can kill just about anybody but a crusading journalist and a law student ? We 're also supposed to believe that Darby 's brief , based on unsubstantiated suppositions , is enough to warrant her death - you 'd think that those with power are smart enough to know that most routinely dismiss conspiracy theories for that reason . ) Like all so-called thrillers , this one is n't solved - once the story runs out of steam , the script merely dredges up somebody who can explain all . ( `` Brief '' is typical of modern thrillers populated by brilliant characters who nevertheless never actually do any detective work - virtually all relying on some mysterious stranger to walk out of the gloaming with all of the answers . ) Over two hours of overwrought tension are n't enough to match the detective-smarts you 'll get in a single half-hour of Scooby Doo . The final insult is the leaden seriousness that Pakula bathes the script in . We not only have to believe this flick , we have to believe IN it . What 's impossible to believe is how the `` Pelican Brief '' poses any danger at all . You 'd think that a cabal of rich right-wingers could afford to do a better job than a law student could uncover . You 'd also think that had Shaw been brilliant enough to solve the mystery , she would have been smart enough to realize the danger it posed her - illustrating the modern thriller 's other big failing , its reliance on characters who are gifted and brilliant but never all that smart .	-1
Ok- so I can see there are some die-hard Julia Roberts fans out there . Too bad . Just raving about her will never improve her acting skills ( an oxymoron ) . Actually , the poor quality of this movie is astounding , considering its director , the cast ( excepting our girl Julia ) and the book upon which it was based . Though he 's done some much better work , when Pakula threw this film together he was clearly thinking of only one thing : `` Hmm , 'Presumed Innocent ' was a winner . Let 's follow that same formula and do another one . It 'll sell . '' Unfortunately , by the time the story from the book by John Grisham got to the screen , it lacked any of its original punch . As for Denzel , he should be ashamed of himself . He 's about as enthusiastic in this as a turtle heading for the beach . I guess he probably needed the cash for another house . Then again , he 's opposite Julia . No further comment needed -other than , save your money .	-1
This review is for the new Blu-Ray version.The Right Stuff is one of my all-time favorite movies . I have been waiting for the Blu-Ray version for several years . And tonight I finally got a chance to watch it.Lo and behold , the lips of the actors ai n't synchronized with the voicetrack . No kidding . I 've never seen this problem before with a Blu-Ray version.I 'm going to return my copy and ask for an exchange . If the next copy has the same problem , I 'm just going to forget it . I am furious !	-1
The reason this film cratered at the box office is -- -- that it is not very good . The pacing is terrible , scenes drag on endlessly , and a whole lot of stuff could have been cut to make this a good movie.I had n't seen this movie in a while , so I watched it again recently , and man , this is a much worse film than I remembered . Ed Harris is good as John Glenn , and his kindness to his wife and her stutter is touching , and the scene with LBJ is great . Also , all the Yeager scenes are very good with Sam Shepard . But -- -- -that makes up maybe , 30 % of the film .	-1
I am sorry for the other riviewers , I thought the movie was original , and well acted , but also boring and meaningless.This is unless , you are really into homosexual , and feminine men.The beautiful Parker Posey , was a good actor and beautiful as always.I would not buy it or rent it , unless everything else slightly viewable fos already gone .	-1
This movie is n't funny , at least if your I.Q . is higher than 50 . The actors play well but the script is lower than medium . I recomend you just rent this , if you are curious , from your video store and you do n't throw your money out the window by buying it . There are tons of much funnier movies than this . Buy South Park !	-1
Though I consider the first `` Ace Ventura '' film to be perhaps my favorite comedy of all-time , `` When Nature Calls '' is nothing more than a shame to both the legacy of the first film and to Jim Carrey 's career.Likely rushed to the theaters ( only a year after part one ) due to the success of the first movie , `` Ace 2 '' never even comes close to capturing the pure hilarity of the first effort , and ( on its own merit ) is n't even that funny overall . Whereas in the first go-round Carrey was able to do his crazy facial reactions and physical comedy that made him a household name , in this film ( because of the very poor quality of jokes/gags ) he completely overreacts to every situation . I never thought I would say that Carrey could overreact to anything , but he actually does go WAY too far time after time after time.Though the first 10-20 minutes of `` When Nature Calls '' are moderately funny , from there the movie absolutely tanks . The first time I watched it , I actually fell asleep about 20 minutes in , as the jokes/Carrey were no longer holding my interest whatsoever.Thus , I would not wish this film on anyone . If you want more of Carrey 's best performances , stay away from it at all costs , as it will leave you wondering how/why he would even sign off on the script .	-1
Unfortunately I had to return this movie because it kept cutting out and then really messed up the end of the movie - much ofthe movie went black . You made it easy to return and I felt bad that this happened since this was a gift for my Mom .	-1
Story line is not very interesting or funny . Chevy Chase is his usual self but not as funny as he gets older .	-1
This is a really poor attempt to revisit the characters from Christmas Vacation , and the plot , lines , and characters are pretty weak . I really ca n't recall a memorable line or scene . I 'd recommend watching Christmas Vacation a 50th time rather than watching this one .	-1
Despite the glowing reviews for this fourth Griswold outing , I beg to differ . The Griswold trilogy ended on a high note with 1989 's CHRISTMAS VACATION . Unfortunately this production is as robust as using the same coffee grounds repetetively.By the title alone you already know the story . Almost every movie or television show that has an episode in Las Vegas has the same basic plot . You saw it with Elvis Presley , the Flintstones , the Saved by the Bell gang , and films like Honeymoon in Vegas and Indecent Proposal and so on . It 's no surprise the Clark is going to gamble away more than he should , put stress on his family , and win it all back at the end.It was great to see Clark , Ellen , and Cousin Eddie again together again . They could have scripted a better cinematic vehicle for them . Forget the side stories about the kids . The Griswold kids in this film are virtual strangers . Wayne Newton and Beverly D'Angelo intially show promise in what what could have been a satire of INDECENT PROPOSAL , but that subplot never really goes anywhere . Randy Quaid is the sole redeeming feature of this film.There are brief flickers of the Griswold magic , but never enough to carry the whole film . This film is worth seeing , but VEGAS VACATION is no more a `` Vacation '' film than CHRISTMAS VACATION II . Keep this DVD separate from the original trilogy .	-1
I first saw Vacation when it was released 30 years ago and thought it was hilarious . Thirty years have changed me , but Vacation remains the same and today I see it as uninteresting , banal , and a few scenes as racist . Of course , I 'm no longer a drunk having a mid-life crisis . Today I 'm a sober senior citizen at peace with myself and with the world . So what I found entertaining back then is no longer appealing to me .	-1
LETHAL WEAPON 2 is Director and Co-Producer Richard Donner 's worst movie -- until Joe Pesci saves the day ! ! ! Richard Donner has had an amazing career , with lots of successful movies that made a lot money and are pretty good art , too , like SUPERMAN : THE MOVIE , and THE OMEN , and his first LETHAL WEAPON movie was the proverbial tough act to follow , but LETHAL WEAPON 2 is awful until Joe Pesci steals the show ! I do n't know what Joe Pesci 's got in LETHAL WEAPON 2 -- he does n't have it in LETHAL WEAPON 4 -- but in this movie he 's funny , he 's clever , and he 's a likable third wheel for Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as they return to their roles as policemen Riggs and Murtaugh , with Pesci as a federal witness for them to protect , and you can guess where things go from there ! This time the villains are n't mercenaries , they 're South Africans making counterfeit money , and one of the film 's best lines is when Pesci brings Glover into the South African Embassy where an Afrikaner informs him , `` But ... but ... you 're black ! ! ! `` But when Pesci 's not in the scenes , there 's just none of the fire of the first movie , and instead of the nonstop action of LETHAL WEAPON we 're left with scenes like Gibson spending quality time at the Murtaugh 's house chopping vegetables and nonchalantly talking about the death of his wife , a major part of his character in the first movie . Maybe by LETHAL WEAPON 2 Gibson and Glover are simply tired of playing the roles , because they just do n't have any of the magic of their first movie together , but when Joe Pesci 's in the game , one thing 's for sure : LETHAL WEAPON 2 IS JOE PESCI 'S BEST MOVIE ! ! !

i got this for my husband as a christmas present . i watched these with my dad as a kid ( the TV version ) and did n't enjoy it as much as i remember . plus the F word was mentioned maybe 50 times in the movie . a turn off for sure .	-1
There is nothing special about this film at all ... ... Harry is no vigilanty ; I really thought he was this cop hunting down the bad guys and killing them ... .he 's just after this one guy.I wont recommend this at all ... I really am not sweet on this at all.One Star ... .certainly not enough to light up my movie world .	-1
Clint Eastwood has , over the years , quite cleverly hidden a speech impediment that hampered his early forays into acting . His technique is based on an old French teaching about the linguistic problems experienced by some people , such as Jonathan Ross . Both Clint and Jonathan have difficulty pronouncing the letter 'w'.Whereas Rossy just dives on in and has made it a feature of his persona , Clint has used the Fleuron approach where the letter is pretty much negated and often not pronounced at all . In 'Dirty Harry ' , his line about feeling lucky , to the punk , he says , ' ... to tell you the tooth ... ' , note 'tooth ' , not 'truth ' . To most ears this sounds acceptable and normal but in all of Clints films , use of 'w ' words is kept to a strict minimum.The music in this film is also quite grating , possibly to cover for the woeful dialogue . A chap called Lilo Shafter did the music , and from scant listening it sounds like music from a skin flick from the same era . All in all I can not see one good thing to recommend this excellent film to others to miss it.The story is entertaining , the acting is bad , the special effects are terrible , editing and lighting is adequate given the equipment used but unforgivable in this day and age of DVD 's and MP3 's . All in all , I would give this film 3 stars , minus two for the reasons above , plus 3 for Clints acting , minus 2 for the title , add three for the music , take one for the bloke out of Hellraiser being in it and finally minus 2 for the use of the Fleuron approach to the 23rd , and sacred , letter.Ramsey Tupper - ( c ) 2006 - Re-hashed by Mr Bus	-1
Do n't blame Bob Fosse for his direction . Do n't blame the song `` Money Makes the World Go Round '' . Do n't blame the incredibly spooky yet intensely real Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies . Whatever you do , do n't blame the choreography . So , why is n't `` Cabaret '' a better film . Where should the blame fall ? As a first time viewer of Liza Minnelli , an amateur young Michael York watcher , and my only experience with Bob Fosse was the dramatic experience of `` Lenny '' , `` Cabaret '' boasted big songs , big ideas , and big actors ... yet it felt long , dull , and convoluted to say the least . Edging on the historical , but focusing mainly on a squabble of young love , the muddled themes of originality , independence , and sexual revolution seemed to take backstage for overacting , choppy editing , and a twisty story that begs for more but desires nothing . In the Oscar world of `` The Godfather '' vs. `` Cabaret '' , the obvious winner is Coppola 's film - but how did `` Cabaret '' even get in the running ? As it took me nearly three viewings to conquer this behemoth , one has to question the 1972 value , and whether this musical stands up next to the others nearly 40 years later . In this reviewer 's opinion , it is an obvious `` no '' , but arguments will apparently follow.Where did `` Cabaret '' work ? If discussing this film around the cinematic water cooler , there would be no doubt Joel Grey would be discussed . His portrayal , as small as it was , as the infamous Master of Ceremonies has yet to be repeated in any film to date . In various moments `` Cabaret '' felt like it was directed by Terry Gilliam , complete with the flash and darkness subsequent in his features . Joel Grey brought it to the table , and will forever be a frightening , yet influential image in my mind . He made the nearly 2-hours redeemable . The excitement in his swagger coupled with his level of pizzazz completely overshadowed his co-star Minnelli whenever the two shared the screen . His performance alone , the transformation itself , is what made `` Cabaret '' worth a view . It was he and Minnelli 's duet of `` Money Makes the World Go Round '' that saved this film from utter obliteration . It was reminiscent of a modern day `` Moulin Rouge '' , but it was the surrounding story - without surrounding characters - that caused the pain known as `` Cabaret '' . One must also applaud Bob Fosse for his direction , for without him , these dark scene filmed with Grey would have just been as bland as the story . Fosse took this flimsy story of three characters that we are emotionally void for , and pulled in some great song and dance numbers to buffer the pain that was sure to follow . His work on `` Lenny '' was outstanding , and while this did n't speak as greatly , you could see his influences on the script and final edit . Thank you to Fosse and Grey for transforming this drab film into cinematic mediocrity.To bookend the positive , one must also ask `` Where did ` Cabaret ' fail ? '' Without wasting pages of words , `` Cabaret '' failed because of the sloppy editing , the poorly developed historical slant , and due to the massive disappointment from the actors . This could have been a memorable song-and-dance rooted with historical symbolism-esque film , but instead fell flat thanks mainly to the horrible nature of Liza Minnelli . Her flat voice matched well with her disassociated character , which carried no emotion , flaunted no values , yet tried to win our heart . She sang decently , but I just could n't stand behind her as a central focus . Her entire relationship with Michael York is flippant . Does she love him ? Does she love money ? What is her true background ? What does she want from life ? Mix these unanswered questions with the uncomfortable hint of sexuality between York and Minnelli , and you have nearly 90 % of this movie . From Minnelli 's undefined character , to the passive aggressive York duel-jobbing as both language educator and African safari supporter , there just is n't a character you can stand behind . As we get close to the middle of the film , our writer seems to realize this and the extremely vague Maximilian is introduced as a man who enjoys the company of both Minnelli and York . For `` Cabaret '' to work , there needed stronger characters for us to follow - ones that were defined , yet complex , not just jumping from emotion to emotion . How did Minnelli win an Oscar for this mess ? In addition to the horrid acting , the story felt rushed and unfocused as we try to keep up with the blend of music and drama . Outside the of intermittent use of Grey , our writer - Jay Presson Allen - tried to incorporate what was happening in Germany at the time with the Nazi movement , with the chaos of a cabaret show . In theory , this would be a great idea - but it failed because of again , the lack of focus with our characters . In one scene we are troubled by York 's disagreement with one of Minnelli 's haphazard choices ( a big decision that was diminished by choice ) and in the next , we are dissecting the idea of a German Jew . It just did n't flow well together . In another scene , we are forced to listen to a young Nazi soldier sing a ballad that evokes singing from everyone - and our characters just drive away . For me , to best summarize this film would be one of the final scenes between York and Minnelli as she takes him to the train station . She leaves by merely waving her hand , demonstrating her care for the characters and ours as well . When this film was over , I took it out of my player , walked away waving unemotionally . `` Cabaret '' failed because there was nothing for the audience to hold onto . When the breakout actor was someone that did n't speak but merely sang that should speak about how the film as a whole turned out.VIDEO : This DVD is old . If you can say that a DVD has aged , then this would be the example . The transfer was poor , the special features were dated , and like the film itself - it left quite a bit to be desired . As an Oscar-winning film , I felt there should have been something more substantial.VISUAL : Again , whoever put this DVD together should be fired . This was cropped on all the sides , providing a small box within your screen to watch the action unfold . There was quite a bit of graininess and lack of color that hurt the final production of this film . Beware for those who loved `` Cabaret '' , this is not the format in which this film , or any film , should be viewed.SOUND : Obviously , a key element to the film - it actually sounds decent here . While the picture may be utterly distorted , the music felt vibrant and clear.EXTRAS : What do I hate more than a poorly planned musical made in 1972 , how about page flipping extras . While there is quite a bit packed into this single disc , most is page turning instead of actors talking us through the process . There are two instances where we have the opportunity to speak to York , Minnelli , and Grey ( as well as a slew of producers ) about their experiences , but they are double-dipped . We hear them talking in one special feature , then in the other - the reiterate the same experiences . Dud.Overall , both with presentation and delivery , `` Cabaret '' failed . Minnelli 's acting and eyes told a different story , and portrayed a character that just did n't fit for a feature film . What was attempted as original just felt stale after the first several scenes . Fosse 's direction and Grey 's performance are the only two saving qualities of this film , as the flakey York does his best as a love interest . The dual sexual roles are just too abashing for both the actors and the viewers . I was eager to witness this film , but nearly 40 years later , this film has not held up . Bravo to small part and big directors , `` boo '' to those that think Minnelli can carry her weight as an Oscar winning actress . ( Does that hurt anyone else to say that ? ) ** Waves eagerly as you leave this review **Grade : * out of *****	-1
This is one of the most awesome films of all time . Winning critical praise and 8 Oscars to boot . It is the ultimate `` musicalwith a message . '' Yet still no truly restored Blu-ray version of this important film is available and I wonder why ? From the reviews I 've read here for years now the DVD versions of Cabaret that are available are a real let down for consumers and fans of the film . Comments range from `` terrible quality '' to `` not worth '' buying . Does anyone know why the Warner Bros. studio refuses to release this film in a format it so richly deserves ? I 'm giving 2 stars because I do n't like the fact that no Blu-ray of Cabaret is available after more than 40 years .	-1
If your interested in the down side of humanity , the darkness of societies acceptable evil , this is your movie . As it moves from scene to scene , it continues to introduce more episodes of social and lifestyle choice dysfunction . You may have to shower to clean after this one .	-1
OK , there are times you want to relax by watching something easy and entertaining , so you go for a movie with a bit of this'n'that : action , violence , humor , romance . This was my premise when choosing this movie . I was hoping for very uncomplicated fun , with some mystery , action , intrigue , romance , etc . Let 's face it , we might love gourmet cuisine , but every once in a while a hotdog sounds really good . Well , this hotdog was a real dog . Sure , this is a straightforward movie , with an easy to follow plot , and with many of the ingredients listed above , but the end result was bad . Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor , and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy , decent but not very bright , getting in trouble ( as usual ) . Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor . The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself . But in summary , this movie was way too lame and predictable , better left on the shelves .	-1
It amazes me how so many viewers can find the antics of a man behaving like a spazstick so hilarious.Jim Carrey 's character in this movie is so irritating and stupid you want to smack him.The story is pathetic , the acting makes you feel sick , and there is not a clearly defineable `` joke '' in the whole movie.In my opinion , this sort of movie should only appeal to a maximum age limit of 2 year old children , and anyone else who laughs at it should seriously grow up.Carrey 's future hits , Dumb And Dumber and The Mask , have only worked on their premises , definetely not on this `` comics '' individual comedic talent.For comedians with far superior laugh inducing abilities , may I recommend the likes of Leslie Nielsen and Robin Williams.Please avoid this unbearable film and it 's wretched sequel .	-1
This is one of my favourite films starring Jack Nicholson . One generalised thing that gets me is that a lot of the people I know have n't seen it . Believe me , it 's a classic.Jack plays McMurphy , a new edition to a mental institute . This is due to a rape and five charges of assault . About ten minutes into the film , when McMurphy 's talking to the doctor about why he 's there , McMurphy says 'I think we ought to get to the bottom of RP McMurphy ' . This certainly happens by the end of the film.OFOACN ( it 's as difficult to abbreviate the title as it is to write it out ) is plainly shot but smooth . The colouring is bleak and drab . It 's like when you come out of a cinema , where you 've just seen a special effects film , and you see the colour of real life.It 's a film about breaking the rules ( like Brando 's The Wild One ) but it 's also hilarious . It 's difficult to concentrate on the meaning because the film is so enjoyable to watch . In my opinion , OFOACN is questioning sanity . How can you class people as insane when it 's so difficult to describe sanity ? Hell , just look around you.Over the years , you can watch it again and again . Frankly if you 're interested in film and do n't see this you must be insane .	-1
Unfortunately , the image is cropped to full screen . Ironically , the trailer included on the disc is in 16X9 !	-1
Had I known this was not widescreen I would never have bought it . I knew it was a flawed film , but I wanted to see the performances AND the artistry of cinematographer Sven Nykvist -- which is ruined in this cropped version . Apparently the film has never been released on DVD in its original format . Also , for those who refer to the Lana Turner version as the `` original '' version , you should see the Italian film that preceded the others , called `` Ossessione '' by Luchino Visconti .	-1
I dont know why people say this one is good . its soo bad . The only good things is Tommy Lee Jones , who does a really good performance . And thats all thats true about what i heard . There is not so much fight scenes as i expected , I thought this would be like 100 times better than the second , but it wasnt . The only fight scene worth to watch is the knife fight in the end ...	-1
After seeing this movie I developed a tumor the size of Seagal 's ego . I have since had it removed and chemo seems to be working . But I must warn you to check your health insurance to see if it covers treatment for Steven Seagal based cancer of the soul .	-1
Husband and wife attend a faculty party ( husband is in history dept , wife 's father is president of university ) and get drunk . Walk home , drink some more , yell and demean each other . Wife mentions she has invited another couple over ( at this late hour ) . Other couple arrives , they all drink , reveal personal information , drink some more . Lots of yelling and derogatory talk . Love/hate relationship with first couple . They need a divorce.I found nothing meaningful in this film . It was quite unpleasant to watch .	-1
I did not like it and deleted it before it finished . What more can one say if it was not interesting enough to watch .	-1
With the big name actors and actress ' I thought this would be a really good movie . Well it was n't . It was just really dumb . It was supposed to also be a comedy . . .but I must have missed the humor.I gave it two stars because at least it was n't filled with foul language and nude scenes !	-1
Clearly this movie has an all star cast . The story line is awful . I did finish watching the movie but I also played games on my Kindle during the whole second half because the movie is so bad .	-1
HIGHLY overrated movie . The presence of Will Freidle is what kills this movie . He 's bad in Boy Meets World and he 's even worse as the star of this film . The only redeeming factor is Jennifer Love Hewitt , who as always stands out amongst crowds . Maybe it 's because I watched Overnight Delivery right before checking this movie out but the two are very very similar , complete with matching humvees by the lead females . Oy .	-1
Man , hearing Joel Schumacher say that during the audio commentary makes the purchase of this dvd all worthwhile . That being said , his apology does not justify his 1997 abomination `` Batman & Robin '' , by far the worst movie I have ever seen.This film is bad : bad acting , bad plot , bad set designs ( Gotham has become an outdoor Studio 54 ) and a bunch of other bad things . It 's not worth it to even go into any of them . Now , here 's the real kicker : in addition to an already bad movie , there 's some bad extras . I did n't even get through watching the extras because they are so bad.So why buy this dvd ? To hear Schumacher apologize . That just makes buying this dvd worth it . It does n't justify this film 's existence , but it 's fun to listen to him do it .	-1
Once upon a time , there was a film called Batman . It was a dark , moody film , about a dark , brooding figure trying to find some kind of revenge for the death of his parents . It was about urban decay and the need for romance and mystery in tawdry , hum-drum lives . It starred two of the greatest pieces of casting of the eighties - Keaton as Batman , and Nicholson as the Joker . And what have we arrived at ? A children 's film , starring superheroes who attend parties , villains who must n't be allowed to die , and lines that Pee-wee Herman would reject as improbable . Tim Burton was the man for this series - Schumacher is not . Ladies and gentleman , I give you one of the most badly written , trashily directed , awkwardly acted , stupidly plotted , and nauseatingly conceived mangled finger-painting of a film it may ever be your misfortune to gaze upon in disbelief . Be warned .	-1
In one of the worst comic book adaptations in recent memory , director Joel Schcmacher effectively destroyed the Batman francise , caused a slump in sales of Batman comic books , and CDN.The film is so horrible , it made the direct-to-video Marvel films ( The Punisher , Captain America ) look like genius in comparison.The film is so cheesily contrived , it made Howard The Duck look like Star Wars.The film 's dialogue is so bad it makes Jean Claude Van Damme 's dialogue look like it was written by Quentin Tarantino.But enough venting.Here is exactly what 's wrong with this film . 1 : The characters.Tim Burton 's Batman ( 1989 ) and Batman Returns ( 1992 ) each featured a manageable three core characters ( Batman , Joker , Vicky Vale , and Batman , Catwoman , Penguin , respectivly ) .Batman Forever ( 1995 ) had five ( Batman , Robin , Riddler , Two-Face , Chase Meridian ) .B & R had the most ( Batman , Robin , Batgirl , Mr . Freeze , Poison Ivy , Bane , Alfred , Julie Madison ) .While some film franchises do succesfully add characters ( Star Wars , for one ) it is due to the fact that the characters are familiar.With all of these characters venting their excess baggage , it 's impossible to get any feel for the characters . Which brings me to ... 2 : Faithfulness to the source medium.Bane was supposed to be the most deadly Batman villan of all , paralyzing Batman from the waist and temporarily ending his crime fighting career.Instead of being Batman 's intellectual and physical superior , he is reduced to a monosyllabic buffoon in the movie , who 's dialogue consists of `` bomb ... bomb ... bomb '' ( or , pehaps he was referring to the box-office totals ) .Batgirl was supposed to be Commissioner Gordon 's daughter , who originally wore the costume for a Halloween party.Here , she 's Alfred 's niece who becomes Batgirl after finding a CD-Rom with the Batman secrets on it.Do n't even mention the fact that Bane uses the `` Super Soldier Serum '' ( does the name `` Captain America '' ring a bell ? ) ! 3 : Overall tone.Apart from the characters , the film has nothing to do with the current issues of Batman being put out or the first two films.Gone is the dark , gothic tones of the comics and the Burton movies , replaced by the gaudy , campy tone of the 1960 's TV show with Adam West.Both Shumacher and WB failed to realize that comic books have since grown up , and so has the moviegoing public . 4 : Dialogue.Instead of intelligent speech , we 're subjected to stupid one-liners : '' Let 's kick some ice ! `` , '' How about slippery when wet ? `` , '' Stay cool , birdboy ! `` `` Kill the heroes ! `` , '' It 's the hockey team from hell ! `` An Adam Sandler movie has smarter dialogue than that ! 5 : Action sequences.Schwarzenegger and Clooney were given thirty pound costumes that severly resticted their movement and made fight scenes virtually impossible.So , in lieu of real fight chorerograghy , the audience is given quick editing to give the illusion of a fast and furious fist fight.NOT ! Sloppy editing is no substitute for real fight choreograghy . 6 : '' Humor '' .Batman flashes his credit card and says , '' Never leave the cave without it ! `` .Robin repeats a line from the previous film , '' Chicks dig the car ! '' .Mr . Freeze gives Batman a cure for a disease and says , '' Take two and call me in the morning '' .Batgirl finds Batman 's secrets , to which Robin comments , '' I guess were going to have to kill her '' .This was intended to be humorous , I merely groaned.The two times I laughed was when Dr.Fries ( played by Arnold Schwarzenegger ) falls off a ledge into a liquid vat and screaming on the way down , and when Batgirl ( played by Alicia Silverstone ) starts fighting with Poison Ivy ( by Uma Thurman ) .Unfortunately , I do n't think those was intended to be funny . 7 : Marketability over substance.Sure enough , the film cost over $ 120 million to make , much was used to pay the big named actors astronomical salaries.It had a hot soundtrack with tunes by the then-big thing Smashing Pumpkins.It had Happy Meal plug-ins , a theme-park ride , and a bunch of t-shirts to be made from.But with that much money , they could have made a much better movie . 8 : The gratuious crotch , rear , and breast shots.There are two unnecessary sequences where Batman and Robin ( at the beginning ) and Batgirl ( near the end ) are getting into costume.The camara focuses on butts , crotches and breasts caused me to STOP enjoying the film.As soon as I saw Chris O'Donnell 's and George Clooney 's vinyl covered butts on screen , I felt the need to run away screaming from the theatre.Unfortunatly , I would have had no way of getting home if I did ( was with family at the time ) .Surely enough , I was not the only one who felt this way , as poor reviews and suicidal word of mouth promptly sunk this film 's box-office grosses , causing it to barely recoup its budget and marketing costs , and causing WB to consider dumping the franchise.Later on , Joel Schumacher would go on to blame the movie 's box-office failure on the `` unpoliced internet '' and on the die-hard comic book fans who did n't embrace the lack of faithfulness to the original source medium.George Clooney would later blame himself for the destruction of the Bat-franchise.Judging on who the two lead players of the movie choose to lay blame , the one the audience can lay blame on is obvious .	-1
I did like this film some but it 's not a great movie . In this movie MR Freeze blanketed Gotham City with ice that he shot out of the telescope . It is impossible to shoot ice through a telescope . That was stupid . When Batman tried to thaw Gotham by shooting sunlight out of the telescope , that would 've been possible.In a scene Bruce Wayne told Dick Grayson that Alfred was dying . During this scene , George Clooney had a smirk on his face . That was bad acting on Clooney 's part and bad directing on Schumacher 's part . This entire scene should 've been reshot.Batgirl starred in this film . But she did n't become Batgirl until around the end of the movie . And she wore a tiny mask instead of a cowl that I expected her to have.I did n't hate Batman & Robin but I have to admit that it was n't a good movie . I give it a 2 star rating .	-1
I do n't remember much about this movie . I just remember back in 1997 I saw it on opening night . By the time the ending credits rolled , I walked out of the theater feeling horribly , horribly used . I felt cheap . I had allowed myself to be used as a pawn in a cynical , cash-making Hollywood scheme . I was ashamed of myself.First of all , Governor Schwarzenegger ( aka : & quot ; Der Gropenfuhrer & quot ; ) did not deserve top-billing for this piece of garbage . The frickin ' movie is entitled & quot ; BATMAN & amp ; ROBIN & quot ; ! Arnold does n't play EITHER of those characters ! What the ( * @ # & amp ; $ ( * @ # * $ ! ^ ? ? ? ? Secondly , George Clooney needed the cash . Period . He was an up-and-coming star at the time . He was still & quot ; Mr. ER & quot ; from TV . After chastising the media for its alleged role in Princess Diana 's death ( and conveniently stealing that week 's headlines ) , Georgie-Porgie-Pudding-and-Pie needed some cash and some publicity and he got it . Wa-hoo , George . Fortunately , he later hooked up with Steven Soderbergh and turned away from poo-poo platter like this movie.Third : Chris O'Donnell . UGH ! I am ashamed that I share a common Irish heritage with this pud ! BLEH ! Fourth : Alicia Silverstone was in this movie ? Wow ! Remember when she was going to be the next Julia Roberts ? Whatever happened to her ? Was she on & quot ; The E ! True Hollywood Story & quot ; recently ? Fifth : Uma Thurman . I like Uma . The green eyelashes do n't do her justice . Let 's just forget she was ever in this movie . It never happened.And , last -- but not least : BANE . Truly the most horrifying screen villain since Gary Coleman . Why is he called & quot ; Bane & quot ; ? Well , you see ... he 's the ... BANE ... .of society . Get it ? Bane ? Of society ? I can see you 're shaking in your boots . Please stop now.Anyway , the bad guys try to take over Gotham City and the good guys ( Batman & amp ; Robin ) are out to stop them . Throw in the usual & quot ; Will Bruce Wayne reveal his true identity ? & quot ; plotline and blah blah blah blah blah . You can see why they never made another & quot ; Batman & quot ; movie . This one effectively killed the franchise . Praise the Lord !	-1
With `` Batman Forever ( 1995 ) '' Warner Bros. decided to take the Batman franchise in a much lighter direction , more `` kid-freindly '' , if you would . What emerged was a flashy , shallow , tepid Comic movie , lacking the psycholigical , and overall adult-oriented approach of Tim Burton 's first two films . And while Burton 's films can be seen as > character studys/social satires-consisting of Burton 's consistancy of theme and explortion of- '' the Outsider '' & lt ; , Shumacher 's film , when one happens to dig a little deeper , represents his own inflatuation with Batman . The Riddler being Schumacher-The Riddler being obssessed with Batman . It 's sorta like some of the many hidden agendas of Director James Whale 's `` The Invisible Man ( 1933 ) '' , but please lets at least spare Whale for NOT comapring him to Shucmacher . Besides there was a difference -- Whale was a genious , Shucmacher was a happy-hack at best . Anyways , lets get back at the subject at hand . Now Batman Forever -- as a comic book film adaption , it pretty much is a piece of rut . As a movie in general , on a technical standpoint-it was well made , and can be quit entertaining . So lets just say it 's a good ol ' popcorn movie at best , providing some good harmless fun . Now `` Batman & Robin '' , not only is it the piece of rut `` Batman Forever '' was , but techincally there are no saving graces what so ever . The film is poorly executed at best , the editing job it just plain Horrid ! And aside of Michael Gough 's wonderful perfomance as the dying Alfred Pennyworth , the acting is more wooden then a baseball-bat . Once again the film features false characterizations-Like `` Batman Forever '' -Mr . Freeze is not some flameing Ice-cap who goes around spewing out corny one-liners . But a very-serious , cold tragic villian who only yearns for to be with is wife again , even if that means taking the lives of others ( Pick up and read a Batman comic book , and then you 'll know what I 'm talking about , ... better yet , if one would actually go out of their way to reading a Batman comicbook , they would have the common sense to know THIS is NOT Batman-period ! ) ( ... ) P > ( ... ) ( ... )	-1
OK , first thing - it 's obvious that semi-literate trolls with nothing more to do than sit in mommy 's basement and type stupid things on the net are abusing the anonymity of the `` kid 's review '' feature . Flood Amazon with complaints when you see idiocy like the `` review '' below.That being said , I can name one simple reason why this movie utterly failed - they tried to turn Batman into Spider-Man . Not physically , but verbally . Suddenly everyone is making jokes , including Batman . Batman does n't say funny and witty things . He 's the brooding Dark Knight . That 's what they finally got right in Batman Begins - Bruce Wayne had a few humorous lines , but never while in the Batman costume .	-1
Did n't Shumacher care that a lot of real Batman fans would notice this obvious change ? For future Batman movies ( ca n't wait for summer 2005 ! ) ... WB should ignore BOTH Clooney 's portray of Batman and the existence of Batgirl in those movies .	-1
Although Batman and Robin was a mockery , of a tragedy , of a film it did have it 's high points . Like when the credits first rolled . Imagine it . You 're back in that theater , the lights dim . You 're an avid Batman fan . The opening credits roll and the title flashes , BATMAN AND ROBIN . You almost throw your popcorn in the air with anticipation . And then the movie started and you caught up on some lost hours of sleep . But the n movie ended , and that same feeling came back . Because you stared death in the face and survived . Ahh , to be young again .	-1
This movie is so BAD ! It 's nonsensical rubbish with Schwarzenegger ( who was paid a whopping $ 26 million for his three weeks of work on this film ) fitting in nicely with this offensively bad chapter in the Batman film mythos . His version of Mr . Freeze is utterly laughable ... and not in a good way . Mugging his way through lines like `` The ice man commeth , '' Schwarzenegger is arguably the biggest offender this film offers.Talents like George Clooney , Uma Thurman and Alicia Silverstone are completely wasted under the direction of Joel Schumaker . While the sets and costumes are expensive looking , the movie in its entirety comes off as a cheap , boring ripoff of the old TV show that starred Adam West , Burt Ward and Yvonne Craig . This is easily the worst Batman film ever ... .and that 's saying something , because `` Batman Forever '' is just awful , too .	-1
I bought this movie purely to help me design my Poison Ivy Halloween costume . This has got to be the worst Batman movie ever made	-1
This is and will always be THE worst superhero movie of all time . Joel Shumacher made this Batman so ridiculous , naive , unappealing and laughable . The costume , the acting , the plot , the whole thing was a downright failure . I watched this movie when I was 8 years old and I found it stupid . 16 years later , I find it worse . This interpretation of Batman for me is atrocious and ridiculous.Joel made a foolish and comedic Mr.Freeze . In the comics and even in the cartoons , he 's made as a cynical , vengeful human being . In this movie , you see him dancing and cracking jokes ? Poison Ivy was passable , was not that bad . Bane was a joke , a green , ivy drenched small in stature character with no lines but screaming and saying : `` Bane '' .Then you have Robin , O ' Donnell did a good Robin , I ca n't complain , Robin is mostly whiny and vengeful character so his interpretation and role was good . Batgirl was horrible , first of all being blonde kinda changed the whole aspect of the character , secondly , Batgirl was n't such a rebel like in this movie and third , making her Alfred 's niece ? What a turnaround is that ? ! This movie was more of a spoof , a horrible movie all in all . Scenes like the Batman credit card , Batman catching Mr.Freeze , Mr.Freeze saying these one liners that deal with ice all the time , the secondary characters were almost non-existent , a complete failure .	-1
Okay so , Batman & Robin ( 1997 ) one of the worst , if not THE worst superhero movie ever made . If you look up `` BATMAN & ROBIN/ JOEL SCHUMACHER '' on YOUTUBE you will find director Joel Schumacher ( PHONE BOOTH , 8mm ) actually apologize for this movie . I hate to say it , but , his apology simply is n't enough ! The only thing this film was lacking from Schumacher 's vision was the `` BAM ! `` , `` POW ! '' subtitles we used to see in the 1960 's Adam West television show . Arnold Schwarzenegger ( THE TERMINATOR , END OF DAYS ) plays Mr . Freeze and my God is he just awful . The great Uma Thurman ( PULP FICTION , THE AVENGERS ) who plays Poison Ivy , is ALMOST as bad as Schwarzenegger . Then there 's Chris O'donnell ( BATMAN FOREVER , THE CHAMBER ) as the `` boy wonder '' Robin . Need I say more on him ? George Clooney ( FROM DUSK TILL DAWN , THREE KINGS ) is an okay actor , not very diverse , but , okay never the less . However , casting him as Batman is just a horrible joke on the audience . And then , just when you think we 've seen all the horrible B.S . Schumacher can throw our way , him and his trusty screenwriter Akiva Goldsman ( BATMAN FOREVER , A TIME TO KILL ) throw in ... .Batgirl ! Yeah , that 's right , freakin ' Batgirl , played by the lovely Alicia Silverstone ( CLUELESS , EXCESS BAGGAGE ) . Trust me , the only thing going for this joke of a movie is it 's looks . However , looks can be decieving and Batman & Robin fall flat on their heads .	-1
What happens when a film franchise starts off with a massive success , follows that up with a smaller , somewhat unfocused sequel alienating some moviegoers , then comes back with a completely different tone , actors , director , etc. , all of which leaves the movie studio ( Warner Brothers in this instance ) believing that lighter , more family friendly fare may be the way to go ? Well , in the case of the once successful Batman franchise , the end result of this chain of events is the utterly campy , ridiculously acted , slap-in-the-face to the comic book fans , excuse of a movie titled `` Batman & Robin '' . `` Batman & Robin '' follows the Dynamic Duo ( George Clooney as Batman and Chris O'Donnell as Robin ) on yet another adventure as they must take on the villainous pair of Mr . Freeze ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) and Poison Ivy ( Uma Thurman ) . With Mr . Freeze attempting to freeze all of Gotham City 's population to death so that Poison Ivy can remake the city in a more Earth-friendly image , Batman and Robin , along with newcomer Batgirl ( Alicia Silverstone ) joining the Bat-family , must work together as only a family can , in order to save Gotham City 's citizens before time runs out.Where to begin ? This is a tough one for me to determine a good starting point for my critique portion of the review , mostly because the movie is just so horrible , with very few good points , that I find myself unsure of what to criticize first . Oh well , let 's just take the plunge and see what happens.First we have the story , written once again by screenwriter Akiva Goldsman ( `` Batman Forever '' ) , which is one of the campiest , lamest one-liner ridden , with the cheesiest action scenes , little to no drama , and poorly acted , pieces of comic book garbage that I have seen come out of Hollywood since either `` Superman 3 '' or `` Howard the Duck '' . The plot is the thinnest of all of the four Batman films in the franchise , leaving me to wonder if Akiva did n't really feel all that into writing this installment and perhaps allowed a child to do most of the work for him , that 's how low the quality is for the overall story in this movie . I thought perhaps given the tone of the previous film being so much lighter than the first two movies in the series that perhaps the franchise was heading into the direction of the 60 's television series , but I held onto hope that no one wanted to see that again ; apparently I was way wrong . Now , I ca n't blame the writer completely for the lighter direction this franchise took with this last installment ( although I can blame him for how horribly it was written ) ; apparently Warner Brothers felt that because with `` Batman Returns '' audiences complained about it being so dark and twisted , that with `` Batman Forever '' the tone needed to be much friendlier towards children and family audiences . So , due to the success that `` Batman Forever '' enjoyed , which was considerably more than that of `` Batman Returns '' , the WB decided that the fourth installment in the series needed to go even lighter , essentially making the movie funnier , more outlandish , and almost completely devoid of any semblance of drama , basically just recycle the 60 's television series with new actors and you 'll have the movie `` Batman & Robin '' .The second set of problems that I had with `` Batman & Robin '' is with returning director Joel Schumacher ( `` Batman Forever '' ) , who took everything that I did n't enjoy about his previous effort , `` Batman Forever '' , and multiplied it by ten for this movie . For instance , in the previous movie , Schumacher used a lot of neon and bright colors to lighten up the movie 's atmosphere , which felt completely out of place in a Batman film ; so , in `` Batman & Robin '' everything is brighter and utilizes tons of neon , to the point that it feels like every scene has some sort of neon color in it . Another issue I have with the director is that once more Joel chose to leave nipples on the costumes for Batman and Robin , and once again I say to this , `` No nipples on the suits ! Never in the history of the comic books or even in the really good film adaptations ( which would exclude Joel 's attempts ) have there been nipples on the costumes , there 's just no point to having them there ! '' My last major gripe with Joel Schumacher 's direction was that the action scenes were so phony and cheesy that I had to roll my eyes as I watched some of the absolutely ridiculous things both the heroes and villains do in this movie . Every stunt has the feel of obvious wire work , and not very good wire work at that , and all of the fight choreography is so telegraphed that you can see what 's coming a mile away ! One last thing regarding the stunts , whoever decided to have Robin 's motorcycle bust through a wall leaving a hole in the shape of the Robin symbol really should be slapped ( and I 'm thinking the guilty party is you , Joel Schumacher ) , because that is so stupid , that even kids point at that moment and laugh at how ridiculous a stunt that is.My third and final batch of complaints must be aimed at the cast of `` Batman & Robin '' , all of which act as if Jim Carrey had been their acting coach , or should I say `` over-acting '' . Now , I understand that given the lack of a decent script and questionable direction from the writer and director respectively , that the actors did n't have a whole lot to make do with ; however , this is n't the first time a group of actors have had to make something out of nothing , and it 's been done successfully many times over , just not in this movie . George Clooney who had n't done very many feature films prior to this one , was n't the greatest actor at this point in his career ( today he is much more accomplished at his craft ) , and without a doubt George gives the weakest performance as Batman within this franchise . Michael Keaton knew to establish Bruce Wayne and Batman as two discernible characters , the same with Val Kilmer in `` Batman Forever '' , but with George there was no distinguishing between Bruce Wayne and Batman other than the costume , because he played both sides to the character the exact same way . Chris O'Donnell was good as Robin , though not as interesting as he had been in the previous movie . This time around Robin seemed more like a spoiled brat than a superhero , which made Batman seem more like a nanny than the Caped Crusader . Michael Gough portrayed Alfred once more in this installment , and provided the only true source of drama for the entire movie , but even that aspect was n't executed near as well as it should have been.With `` Batman & Robin '' we were also introduced to several new characters , none of which come close to capturing the true essence of what made those characters so great in the comics . Alicia Silverstone ( `` Clueless '' ) as Batgirl was an alright choice , she would n't have been my first pick ; however , she 's a decent enough actress that I thought maybe she could do a good job . Well , she was n't great , but that 's not completely her fault because the story arc she is given is fairly weak all across the board , but her line readings were mostly flat and uninspired . Not to mention the fact that her origin has been altered to make her Alfred 's niece instead of Commissioner Gordon 's daughter , a decision that served as just another problem , in the already far too long list , this movie had going against it . Along with Alicia we also have Uma Thurman ( `` Kill Bill '' ) as Poison Ivy . Now , I thought that Uma definitely looked the part of Poison Ivy , but the constant use of Earth inspired references throughout her dialogue began to grow tiresome , and she apparently felt that because she was playing a villain it would be the perfect opportunity for her to practice the Jim Carrey art of over-acting in every scene in hopes of getting attention , most of which fell pathetically flat . Lastly , we have Arnold Schwarzenegger ( ` The Terminator ' series ) as one of the worst bits of casting I have seen in a comic book inspired movie . In the comics , Mr . Freeze was a skinny man in a mechanized suit with a big freeze gun ; obviously Arnold could n't pull off the skinny man routine due to his physique , so his resemblance to the character 's appearance was nowhere near accurate . Although , to the Casting Director 's credit , DC Comics did change the appearance of Mr . Freeze to resemble more closely that of Arnold in the movie , so maybe the choice was n't all that bad , to me it was just another example of how everyone associated with this movie did not take the source material seriously at all . Aside from Arnold 's obvious physical difference to the character 's initial appearance , his acting in this movie was alright , but just like Uma Thurman 's character of Poison Ivy , writer Akiva Goldsman apparently felt that including as many ice-themed one-liners into his dialogue as possible would be a good idea . Wrong , all that decision did was made his character become incredibly annoying at an even faster rate than Poison Ivy's.Well , you may be wondering when I will get to the good points regarding this movie , because so far it 's all been mostly negative . I do have a couple of positive things to say regarding `` Batman & Robin '' , first I must say that as pathetic as the story was , it did contain some decent elements in regards to trust and family issues that Batman and Robin must face , although sometimes even this was done a little too heavy-handed that it was a bit on the annoying side . Another standout achievement for the movie , was that the special effects ( given that this movie is 11 years old now ) were very good , especially for the numerous `` ice covered '' or `` freezing '' sequences featured throughout the movie . The last good thing I can say for this movie is this ... It ends ! Yes , that is probably the best aspect this movie has going for it , the fact that eventually the movie ends . On the flip side of that , is once the movie ends , you 're left with the nagging feeling of having wasted two hours of your life away that you 'll never be able to get back , other than that it 's all good though . `` Batman & Robin '' , if you have n't figured it out yet , is absolutely the worst installment in the Batman franchise that spanned from 1989 through 1997 ; however as pathetic as this movie is , for some reason it has the same appeal as that of the 1960 's television series and movie . The movie 's like a train wreck , you know the results are going to be horrifying , yet you ca n't seem to bring yourself to look away ; although , this movie does push the limits of that sentiment a few times . `` Batman & Robin '' is rated PG-13 for violence and sensuality .	-1
Will someone tell me how this ended ? I did n't get to finish cuz it was SO BORING abd STUPID ! Way too many characters ! We got three villains ! Mr.Freeze , Poison Ivy , and Bane ! ( LAME ! ) You have Batman & Robin ( duh ) and then they throw in Batgirl ! ( MEGA LAME ! ) Come on ! How lame can this movie get ! ? And also , in the mix , Alfred has a disease is dying ! ( ULTRA LAME ! ) Way too many things happening in this movie ! They shoud have only had Poison Ivy ( Mr.Freeze and Bane do n't need to be in this movie ! ) , they should 've gotten Batgirl out the the movie , shes completely pointless ! And then forget Alfred dying ! That would be a movie that I would watch , instead of this !	-1
What were they thinking ? This movie was all wrong from the beginning . The origins of the three villains was wrong . Batgirl is Barbara Gordon not Barbara Wilson , Alfred Pennyworth had no living relatives . The Dialogue was pathetic . If the movie was darker and the dialogue believable it might have worked . I just hope that the sequel to Batman Begins does n't become a dissapointment . The fans ca n't deal with that again . Trust me .	-1
1997 marked what is more than likely the end of the Caped Crusader 's series of live-action films with the ill-fated release of the fourth film , `` Batman & Robin '' . Taking up the role of the Caped Crusader in this film was the completely unsuitable George Clooney . Unlike his live-action predecesors ( Adam West , Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer ) who each gave a marked realism to the character , Clooney 's portrayal of Batman/millionaire Bruce Wayne was uninspired and pallid , as well as being very poorly acted . Returning from the third film as the Caped Crusader 's sidekick is Chris O'Donnell as Robin/Dick Grayson . Like Clooney , O'Donnell 's performace was equally uninspired , but it was also disconnected from the sorrow and seemingly misunderstood teenager that he portrayed far better in the third film.In this film , Batman and Robin are faced with two deadly enemies : Poison Ivy/Dr . Pamela Isley ( portrayed by Uma Thurman ) and Mr. Freeze/Dr . Victor Fries ( portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger ) . Not only did Uma Thurman overact her part ad nauseam , Schwarzenegger 's ineffectual acting only contributed further to the film 's failure and disappointment . In at attempt to make up for the film 's paltry story , predictable plot and bad acting , director Joel Schumacher repeatedly fills the screen with a collage of fluorescent color and black lighting . If he was attempting to make the film resemble a comic book , he failed miserably because the further lack of realism from the first three films only contributed to the film 's inability to engage the audience.Overall , I can only give this film 1 star for its very poor acting and completely unengaging story . My advice to anyone who has n't yet seen the film is to not bother watching it . The first three films are far better than the fourth . If you have already seen it , it 's easy to see why it unintentionally brought an end to the Caped Crusader ever being on the big screen again .	-1
Batman and Batman Returns both were excellent movies . But this movie failed in so manyways it was ridiculous . I particularly hated the scene with Batman and Robin usingthe whatevers as surfboards coming down from the sky . And poison ivy well ... . lets justsay she was mediocre . And Robin too ... . ( I forgot if they had batgirl in this movie as well ) but this movie , in *my* opinion stinks !	-1
It seems , that Hollywood figures as long as they get a bunch of famous names playing the characters , they can just go and make a flop and still get sales ! ! ! When , I first saw this when I was I do n't know about 6-7 years of age I really liked it , but as I matured and grew I realized that `` Batman and Robin '' was n't actually that good ! ! ! In my life , I 've had the chance to see all the Batman movies from : Batman ( 1989 ) , to Batman Returns ( 1992 ) , Batman Forever ( 1995 ) , Batman and Robin ( 1997 ) , and the brand new Batman Begins ( 2005 ) , and I must say `` Batman and Robin '' , by far is the worse.Joel Schumacher the director of `` Batman Forever '' and `` Batman and Robin '' went a little overboard playing director . `` Batman Forever '' was okay but you could see the change from Tim Burton 's first 2 Batman creations : `` Batman '' and `` Batman Returns '' . Instead of picturing a darker view of Gotham City , he painted more of an exotic comic book style to his two films . In , `` Batman and Robin '' something went wrong changing the storylines and characters ; along with making the film to ploty and out of control , horrible costume design , and he plainly produced a piece of crap . Hey ; maybe if it was in a comic book it would n't be so bad , but this is a motion picture.You may ask : `` Why is Batman and Robin so Bad ? `` ; well believe me it is n't that hard to answer the question ! ! ! First , of all they changed the sacred Batman storyline . Barbra ( Batgirl ) played by Alica Silverstone ; is not Alfred 's niece ; she is Commissioner Gordon 's daughter . Second of all Batman barely uses any of his gagets , yeah once in awhile but Batman and Robin look like a bunch of whimps through out the movie . What 's with the statue of the giant naked man doing in the middle of the city ; gosh cover your eyes.I really never got why Mr . Freeze ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) hideout is at a local Ice Cream shop , ... . how stupid and uncreative can you get . I also do n't get why he has a bunch of eskimos following him around for as well , the whole hockey part at the begging was kinda stupid and uneeded ! ! ! Schumacher really screwed up on Mr . Freeze 's character big time . He even added the whole diamond thing in which kind of ruined the whole movie . Mr . Freeze never needed diamonds in the comic books , so why now ... just make the film all complicated yeah ! ! ! The diamond part was okay and may have added something to the movie but uneeded and unauthenic to the original Batman.The film also made the police look like a bunch of idiots , as the cops go running up to Mr . Freeze with sticks and try shooting him with whimpy pistols . Hey Commisioner ever heard of SWAT or the Army ... . yeah real nice . Well , it was a bit like a comic book would depict the police . Yeah , I got a kick out of it , because it was so stupid it was funny . Any , cop that took the time to watch this was probably rolling around with laughter.Besides , that what is with the costume design . Scumacher took the time to put nipples on Batman and Robin 's costume , what 's with that . Now Batman and Robin look like a bunch of cross dresser yippie ( sarcasm ) , ... ok the costumes still looked cool somewhat ... the nipples though ruined the whole outfit design , and where 's Robin 's classic R symbol , yes it is gone as well.Yes , they have Uma Thurman playing as Poison Ivy , good choice . Yes a few plot changes and such . I never really got how Bane and her got together . In , the comics Bane was n't a slave , ... but still depicted well . Poison Ivy was always a woman , with a heart of stone , and ice in her vains ; she is n't constantly trying to kiss someone , like a girl on spring break ... . hey I did n't have a problem with her personalty change ... . the thing that cracks me up is this ... . If Mr . Freeze did freeze the world , where would she plant her mutant plants ... .. any ideas ! ! ! Yes , there is some eye candy in the movie , but the whole storyline is all messed up and ruined by Schumacher , as he either tried to change the story or do something to exotic . The cat fight between Poison Ivy and Batgirl , was fun to watch . The best part of all was the motorcycle race , which was out of this world . Yeah there are a few other cool moments , but this movie is still a disgrace.On another , note George Clooney did n't give Batman any kind of character . Micheal Keaton from the first two movies did awesome , along with Christian Bale from `` Batman Begins '' , but Schumacher did n't do a good job selecting a Batmans . Val Kimmer , why the hell was he Batman in `` Batman Forever '' , anyways George Clooney was n't the best choice for the part in my opinion.I will give `` Batman and Robin '' a 1.5/5 horrible movie that threw off the whole Batman franshise ! ! ! Yes a cmic book feel , but nothing else ! ! ! See `` Batman Begins '' instead or the 3 before this one . Just forget that this film was ever made ! ! ! -Rogue Fox `` Rogue ''	-1

It was supposed to be the big box office hit of 1997 . It did n't turn out that way and when I saw the movie I found out just why . They turned it into nothing more than a live action cartoon . I shudder everytime I see a scene of this movie	-1
The first three Batman movies were n't too bad , by superhero standards . In fact , despite some glitches and missteps ( let 's not talk about that whole Penguin thing , OK ? ) , they remain among the best comic book adaptations on the market.That said , No . 4 was a mistake . Batman & amp ; Robin manages to spend 125 minutes without a single redeeming scene . Even the big bat battles are disappointing , looking campier than those from the old '60s TV series .	-1
Honestly , how did this one get into theaters ? My GOD , Arnold Schwarzenegger is atrocious here , and the acting is pretty corny/cheesy/horrible throughout . It 's overdone - it 's like the actors knew what a bad job they were doing and parodied themselves.The latest editions of Batman ( Batman Begins , The Dark Knight ) do a lot to rectify this movie , bringing a seriousness and a validity to the story and the developments that this film utterly lacks . Thank everything for Christian Bale and our dearly-missed Heath Ledger ! George Clooney must still be cringing over this one , and it 's no wonder Ah-nold went into politics ...	-1
Batman & Robin i didnt watch this movie since i was a kid.i used to like it when i was a kid but now nope.you can tell it 's a bad movie when you are older now.i like how the movie looks but that 's all i like about it the rest of it is just bad.the acting is bad and you dont care about batman & robin that 's bad for a batman movie.it seems like they focuse on the villians more than the heros.i hate how posion ivy talks it 's so anoying it kills the movie alot.the movie laste a little too long and the story isnt good and the actions seens are boring and slow this movie is a pass .	-1
Personally this is my least favorite movie starring Meg Ryan . Meg does really good playing the tough biker girl , but the movie has a hard time catching up with her in every aspect . The acting is not very good on the exception of Meg . Matthew Broderick is very boring , bland , and overall bad . The plot is unrealistic , and all in all is only good to watch one time . One thumb down , and one thumb up for this movie . Sorry .	-1
& quot ; Contact & quot ; began with promise . The first 30-40 minutes told a compelling scientific detective story . I looked forward to seeing the science team interact , detect , and piece together the alien signals . Sadly , the intelligent characters were cast aside and the plot moved to Washington , D.C. , not known as a mecca for bold , original thinkers.With all the richness and possibilities inherent in cinema , I was frustrated to witness so many scenes revolving around TV news screens and the lingering reaction shots of the cast . Great scientific discoveries were being made , but the director chose to show the characters having dull meetings and watching TV . & quot ; Contact & quot ; was weighed down by sappy music throughout.It was n't possible to take & quot ; Contact & quot ; seriously after the tedious second act . The main character was diminished by the filmmakers ' unimaginative reliance on crudely caricatured antagonists . The sets and special effects were well done , but there was no need to dwell on them.Big Moments happened every 7 minutes , and the story 's power was diluted by the time Dr. Arroway began the space voyage . When there was no turning back and her face was at maximum contortion , I thought she finally understood the true meaning of the cryptic Vega message : It 's a cookbook !	-1
Before I review this film , I am going to say this . If you have n't seen this film - do n't . Track down Disney 's 80s made-for-cable `` Flight of the Navigator '' and be happy with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday night . But if you must ... Contact is a difficult film to review . Based on Carl Sagan 's serenade novel to the stars , the ambitious , and occasionally moving , story of Ellie Arroway taps into the romance of stargazing but fails to explore the larger implications of the Pandoras Box it opens . Like a black sheep family member , I really ca n't hate this film , but it is also so difficult to love it.In many ways Contact is a concept film - a `` what if '' statement on a slice of Kubrick 's 2001 : A Spacey Odyssey . `` What if '' somebody made an entire film on somebody discovering the monolith from 2001 ? `` What if '' the monolith and signal is a radio transmission telling us how to construct an advanced piece of technology ? `` What if '' we ditch the stark soundtrack of deep breathing sounds and add pulsing radio transmissions , romance and a sad story of a little girl losing her dad ? This is the movie Contact is . On paper , it all sounds so interesting , but somehow it all goes very wrong.Jodie Foster invests heavily in Ellie and so does the audience . She is stubborn , driven and also charismatic . What I am not persuaded by is the script 's tacky father-daughter story laced so sloppily into the plot . What I feel , is there is a greater story to be mined here , but the father-daughter angle rings hollow . John Hurt is wasted as a Yoda inspired bald genius and every other character in the film seems recycled from One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest institution staff . There are too many villains and the only supporting character with more than one dimension is Matthew McConaughey . This is one of those movies where everybody is crazy and evil but Ellie . Everybody knows better than Ellie - they know so much better , they do everything she says and in the end , still make her think she is crazy . Ellie discovers the sound , Ellie discovers the bomber , Ellie ... well you get the idea . All the males are paper cut out bastards and little old Ellie is the perpetual victim . It is one of those movies where you are continually frustrated by the contrived characterizations and idiocy of the characters and writing rather than engaging into the story . Yes it is one of those movies.The film is based largely on the idea and euphoria of discovery , but the film offers so little of it . Director Robert Zemeckis tries desperately to resolve questions about aliens and religion within the social conscious , but instead we are given long lectures , congressional testimonials and emotional schlock more fitting to the Young and the Restless . Like a bad episode to the TV series LOST , there are many exciting ideas in Contact but they end up flushed by filmmakers and writers who are afraid to take on these ideas , or even any of Carl Sagan 's ingenuity or conjectures from the novel , with any seriousness or dedication . The filmmakers take the easy way out and play out melodrama instead of insight . The novel 's intricate plot is ditched for a `` are you kidding me ? '' laugh-out-loud `` alien '' beach rendezvous and intelligent writing is ditched in favor of teary-eyed soliloquy to tug at your heart strings . The search for intelligent life in movies continues.The finality does n't do justice to Ellie Arroway any of the deep ideas proposed by the plot or ultimately to the intelligence of the audience . There is , however , one brief redemption . There is a moment in the film where Ellie is lying in the Plains of San Augustin under the VLA telescope listening to static . This is when the first pulse of the alien signal hits . Ellie 's eyes grow large and so do ours . It is an incredible epoch . It is the only moment in the two and a half hour film where Contact actually makes some .	-1
Carl Sagan , the scientist , had a lot going for him . Apparently people cut Carl Sagan , the novelist , a lot of slack because of it . I ca n't think of any other reason that & quot ; Contact & quot ; was n't resoundingly laughed out of bookstores , much less theaters . I know my friends and I were reduced to helpless tears halfway through.The very notion that Jodie Foster is listening to the various frequencies that SETI is scanning for signs of extraterrestrial life is foolish enough , but then the flaws are compounded by repeated improbable meetings with priest Matthew McConaughey . Apparently , his character 's dialogue with Foster 's is supposed to be thought-provoking and challenging . Apparently , the screenwriters have never actually had a thought-provoking or challenging conversation.The payoff to all this foolish mumbo-jumbo is a machine the alien message provides for communicating with them , followed by actual contact . Sagan boldly goes where few esteemed figures have gone before , and rips off John Varley 's novel & quot ; The Ophiuchi Hotline & quot ; for the idea of the aliens giving out plans for an interstellar communication device . Then we get the note-for-note theft of the climax of & quot ; 2001 : A Space Odyssey. & quot ; Space turns out to be Heaven , where lonely little girls can meet aliens-shaped-like-Daddy . It was a foolish concept in & quot ; 2001 & quot ; and it does n't smell any better second-hand.I urge everyone dazzled by this film to pick up works by Arthur C. Clarke and John Varley . At the very least , you should be enjoying the ( far superior ) original source material , rather than regurgitated nonsense .	-1
... when it becomes at turns drearily predictable and unpredictably schmaltzy.The best thing about this film is Jodie Foster ... so easy on the eyes , and such a talented actress to boot ! She projects a very attractive spunkiness and tenacity which fit her slightly masculine features perfectly . The rest of the cast , which includes James Woods , Angela Bassett , and Matthew McConaughy ( sp ) , are pretty competent but they can do only so much when the script goes south towards the end .	-1
I like Jodie Foster . She 's a terrific actress if given the right script ( Silence of the Lambs springs to mind ) . But , like any other human being , she is n't perfect . Contact , apparently her creative child , ought to pop whatever & quot ; genius balloon & quot ; the folks in Hollywood have tried to pin on her sleeve . This movie is slow , overbearing , and not very interesting -- quite an accomplishment for a movie involving inter-stellar travel and first contact with intelligent life outside of Earth . All in all , Foster holds her own compared to the insufferable performance from Matthew McConaughey . Simply put , he is awful , attempting to portray an intelligent representative of the religious point of view . He simply is n't up to that task , and comes across as more of a dumb hick way out of his element . ( Has he ever been good in anything ? Not that I 've seen . ) So Contact just drags on and on , preaching this , prattling on about that , spoon-feeding us the life story of this preeminent scientist ( Foster ) , showing us stereotypical intrigue between those who want scientific progress and those who do not . Added for good measure are some sophmoric attempts to engage in philosophizing about & quot ; big & quot ; issues ( which end up being just plain dumb ) and an ending that simply is n't worth the wait . The long , long wait as Contact crawls to its anti-climactic conclusion .	-1
Silly , self-important nonsense masquerading as deep profound Science Fiction . Jodie Foster plays an utterly humorless and emotionally icebound BUT totally brilliant young woman ( a type of role she is becoming tiresomely expert at ) who is supposed to be carrying a torch for the appallingly inept Matthew McConaughey . The lack of chemistry between them makes a significant part of the story rather hard to swallow . Namely , one ca n't believe that Foster 's walking iceberg has any interest at all in the McConaughey 's inane all-purpose guru.This movie is to serious science fiction what a Hallmark card is to Shakespeare . Slight , admittedly rather efficient , but ultimately forgettable .	-1
Despite an all-star lineup ( Julia Roberts , Mel Gibson , Patrick Stewart ) this movie totally falls flat.It starts out promising . A delightfully disturbed Mel Gibson is a cabbie who rambles incessantly about conspiracy theories to his passengers , himself , and occasionally , no one at all . At the end of the day , he sits in his car and spies on Julia Roberts as she works out on her treadmill . Mel apparently also has a habit of bursting in on Julia at work ( Dept of Justice ) , doing more ranting , and being escorted out of the building . OK , an intriguing opening , what will happen next ? Next we 're thrust into a weird , trippy sequence of Mel being kidnapped , tortured , and interrogated by Patrick Stewart and his unidentified cronies . Mel escapes , runs back to Julia 's office , rants some more . The rest of the movie is a bunch of convoluted chase/capture/escape scenes , with a little awkward romantic tension ( and I mean AWKWARD , Mel and Julia have absolutely ZERO chemistry ) , a bit of dramatic emotion tossed in for good measure ( who killed my father ? OMG tell me who killed my father that the audience has never seen and cares nothing about ! ) , and ... That 's it.We never find out exactly who or what the heck was happening through the entire movie . The whole movie is `` who are you , REALLY ? '' and virtually no answers are given . A hasty bit of explanation here and there , but nothing that congeals the story together and makes it make the least bit of sense.The movie closes with Julia mourning at Mel 's ( supposed ) grave , and her last words for him ? `` I miss your face . '' I 'm not kidding . That 's the most poignant line the writers could come up with , apparently . I was laughing out loud.Of course , then we see Mel lurking alongside Julia as she rides her horse , in a huge black obviously-government-issued SUV , and she has NO CLUE that he 's there . Even though he 's on the road right next to the field she 's riding in , and no other cars are in sight . He 's invisible ! Right ? *cough*A messy story with a way-too-hokey ending . Spare yourself and watch something else .	-1
`` Steel '' , the comic book clunker starring basketball player Shaquille O'Neal , would best be titled `` Steal '' because it manages tie together disparate quotes -- FROM OTHER MOVIES . It even has the lead of `` Shaft '' make Shaft jokes ( ! ! ! ) that are n't funny . O'Neal stars as a soldier whose buddy turns evil ( Judd Nelson ) , and injures his friend Sparky ( Sigourney Weaver lookalike Annabeth Gish ) in the process . Unlike most superheroes , Steel does n't become one until waaay late in the film . Luckily , Sparky gets a cool action sequence in which she blasts the bad guys with her weaponized wheel chair . That is an awesome scene . Steel blunders his way through it . This movie certainly heralded the end of comic book movies for a good long time , and for a good reason . It certainly was n't comic . `` Steel '' only steals your time -- which you ca n't get back .	-1
I just finished watching this abysmal excuse for a movie on TV with my kid . All I can say is that I enjoy my kid 's company , so the 2-plus hours spent on `` Steel '' was not a complete waste of time , but no thanks to this turkey.Folks , we all know Shaq 's acting is on a par with his free-throw shooting , so expectations are pretty low going into a movie like this . In fact , low expectations account for my giving two stars instead of one -- - this actually could have been worse.However , while Shaq 's acting is what we might expect , the movie as a whole displays a sloppiness in overall production that makes what could have been a mediocre effort a downright bad one . It looks more like a made-for-TV effort than a theatrical release -- - bad editing , mediocre sound , amateurish camera angles -- - the production values are bargain basement . Actually , I have seen After School Specials that were more professionally executed than this.Thank God I did not have to waste money on this . Nobody should be monetarily rewarded for this badly-produced piece of junk .	-1
The movie was so filled with filthy words that we turned it off after about 20 minutes.What a waste of money ! !	-1
Can not comment on the film since the disc was bad and would stutter , skip and just lock up and not play after the first three minutes .	-1
Richard ( Artsy ) Linklater , poet laureate of Gen-Nexters , is the kind of director who could be great - if he was n't so lousy . He has a refreshing desire to take risks , defy convention , and flat out ignore devices that have served storytellers for millennia . In Tape he locked three people in a room and held them hostage , along with the audience . In Waking Life he merged morphing animation with stream of conscious dialogue to create a dream within a dream within a college freshman 's philosophy term paper . In Before Sunrise he shows us a brief encounter , ( characterized by the inappropriate illusion of intimacy frequently experienced when traveling ) , during which absolutely nothing happens.Failure is commonplace , failing magnificently requires courage.There are good things to say about Before Sunrise . Vienna looks lovely . Celine , Julie Delpy , looks equally lovely , and acts her part , what there is of it , beautifully . The film is replete with attractive train and trolley shots and even re-uses the marvelous Ferris wheel made famous in The Third Man , ( a movie that actually had a plot ) . The Austrians on the bridge are funny , and the `` milkshake '' poem was wonderful.Things crash quickly after that . Even the colorful street scenes , palm reader , belly dancing , etc . look blatantly staged , you can almost see the grips and gaffers stringing cables one foot out of the shots . Ethan Hawke needs to be told that his scruff does not give him that cool , dangerous Trotsky affect ; it just makes him look like he sleeps in a culvert . Though his acting is workmanlike , he was the wrong choice for a film that depends entirely on the glossy superficiality and shared insanity of romance.When two people speak and listen to each other , that 's called a conversation . When interesting , well-developed characters talk to each other and do things to each other , thereby revealing themselves and being changed in the process , ( and there 's a cameraman on hand ) , that 's called a movie.When two-dimensional characters talk endlessly about whatever in a way that accomplishes nothing and only serves to explore the full extent of their two-dimensionality , that 's called a Richard Linklater movie .	-1
Performances were OK , cinematography was fine , story was OK . Lacked sexual or emotional chemistry . He was an immature little boy by his own admission ; she was a co-dependent perhaps but even so too good for him . What did these two find in each other ? ! Other than company to be walking around Vienna with ? Everything she loved , he belittled or hated ... the fortune teller , and the beautiful poem . The hell with him . They should have made the girl just want him for a romantic roll in the hay.I guess all the rave reviews come from women so desperate for a good romantic movie , they are easily impressed.I too would like to see Hollywood do more in the romance arena , even some adaptations of favorite romance novels , but alas `` BEFORE SUNRISE '' is not one of these masterpieces.Good , OK , worth seeing , but not worth the hype .	-1
There could n't be many movies more pedestrian , predictable and paint-by-the-numbers than this one.Gee , do you think he 'll meet someone on the train ? Think that palm reader will give them a reading ? Will that poet write a poem for them ? Will they have their obiligatory argument ? Will they go just one scene with something original ? Do n't waste your time with this turkey .	-1
The image is cropped , especially on the top and sides . I do n't like seeing the tops of heads cut off in every other scene . It 's grotesque.The dark areas are too dark . Much detail is gone.I 'm new to blu ray . I thought they were supposed to look better , not worse , than DVDs .	-1
This review is to address the blu-ray quality of this movie.It is awful . Grainy , flat , milky . If you want this movie , buy it on DVD , not on blu-ray . Paying extra for blu-ray is a waste of money in this case.As everyone knows , old movies just do n't transfer well to blu-ray ... .but this one transferred worse than most .	-1
I 'm doing a term paper on Mozart for an elective course , and I must say , the film `` Amadeus '' is so far from fact that I could n't really enjoy it . Just do n't watch it thinking you 're going to learn much of who Mozart really was.He and his wife produced six children , for example - the movie shows only one . Would n't the death of 4 of his kids in infancy made him slightly less chipper ? Of course I loved the snippets of music ; who would n't ? But it was more like a smooth melding of `` Greatest Hits Melodies '' than a chance to really get into his music.Can someone recommend - can someone MAKE - a movie that really does Mozart justice ? This movie is really a Johnny One Note .	-1
Another trip for the Griswalds . It just does n't work in Europe of course , and neither does the plot . So not funny .	-1
I should have known better than to rent this turkey as soon as I saw that Rutger Hauer was in it , but none of the listed films seemed any more attractive to me . Stupid plot , bad acting ( on everyone 's part ) , and silly antics on the part of the & # 34 ; thief & # 34 ; in this story . Pass on this one .	-1
This is one of my favorite movies . However my copy skips all the way through it . I was really disappointed .	-1
I am a big fan of Spacey so watch most anything where his name appears . But this one was too much for me and I just could n't make it to the end . You 'll have to watch it yourself to see the ending ... .if you can make it .	-1
MIDNIGHT in the GARDEN of GOOD and EVIL : I kept waiting and waiting for this movie to get interesting . Every time it seemed like it was going to , nothing seemed to follow . And I mean NOTHING ! What 's up with the UGLY transvestite ? Is that the best looking black drag-queen Hollywood could mustar up ? This sick looking slog looked like he was either on crack ( no pun intended ) or was in his last days of his HIV years . Probably both ! It made me laugh every time people acted surprised this sickly looking , bag of sticks , was really a man . People acted shocked and surprised that what they thought was a & quot ; woman & quot ; with a deep voice , ugly as a bulldog and had no figure , was really a man . SHOCKING ! And he kept refering himself as a & quot ; lady & quot ; . Oh that was funny , but I do n't think it was supposed to be . Sorry Clint , no sale here . I was a cab driver for about a year in Tulsa , OK and seen better looking drag-queens than the one , that was supposed to be a diva , in this snore fest of a movie.This movie is miserable and I do n't see why it was even released to DVD ? There are so many more movies that truly deserve the attention and they chose this slop ! The picture quality is very poor , as well . I paid $ 6 for it and got ripped off ! In final : This movie truly is BORING and very hard to watch . If you 're going to watch it , good luck . It 's definately no treasure of the South , that 's for sure .	-1
Noticing the movie was given an overall 4 star rating by other Amazon reviewers we purchased and watched this movie . I had no knowledge of the movie other than what I 've seen here , on Amazon . Kevin Spacey and John Cusack are first rate actors ... .. when they 're in a movie with some substance . Midnight in Garden of Good & Evil is not a movie with substance.The overall plot was disjointed and difficult to follow . A writer is engaged by a magazine to write about a society party in Savannah . That 's about the only `` normal '' event of the movie . The people of Savannah are made to appear like fools . There 's an underlying homosexual agenda that is unwanted . There 's a `` voodoo '' priestess slipping in and out of scenes for no apparent reason . Her character is not well defined nor is the reason for her occasionally popping up.The movie is poorly written with most scenes leaving the viewer wondering what they 're talking about or trying to figure out why the actors are doing what they 're doing . The actors are inconsistent with the characters they portray because of poor writing.The one kinda bright spot in the movie is Lady Chablis as Chablis Deveau . Great role , great acting here and the only reason I give the movie 2 stars instead of 1 .	-1
Honestly , I watched this movie for Russell Crowe . If that 's why you 're here , rent the movie and watch the first ten minutes . After he 's finished licking Salma Hayek 's toes , hit rewind , then play . Repeat a dozen times , then return the movie . The story is sour and depressing , and follows a doomed relationship . There are enough doomed relationships in the real world that I ca n't find a fictional one entertaining . On the plus side , Russell does a nice subtle New York accent .	-1
I was moved to rent this flick after watching James Lipton slobber all over Kim Basinger on Bravo 's Actors ' Studio.What a letdown . Although supposedly set in the 50 's , this movie was intended to invoke the nostalgia for film noir , and ride that wave to big box office receipts.Where to begin ? The flat color of LA Confidential does no homage to the brilliant black-and-white work of true film noir . Outdoor time-placing was accomplished by setting a fedora-ed , wide-lapel-ed guy in a vintage car , in front of some LA neon . It was always a tight shot , to avoid revealing the Taco Bell lurking next door . The indoor scenes were littered appropriately with old fans and furniture , Remington typewriters , etc.The cops were all given a wounded-child persona , which , I suppose , was meant to give a psychological edge to their characters . Pure cardboard.None , NONE , of the characters were worthy of any empathy . How can a movie connect with an audience like that ? Kim Basinger is a major babe , and , from what I hear , a wonderful person . But she is , alas , a so-so actress . She supposedly researched the hell outa Veronica Lake , yet failed completely to capture that lady 's smoldering sexuality . More cardboard.Danny DeVito plays an oily little rat . So what else is new ? Oily cardboard . James Cromwell 's brogue ( Scottish , Irish ? ) waxes and wanes comically throughout the movie.The patois splattered throughout the dialogue was derived from every decade EXCEPT the 50's.The identity of the Big Baddie was telegraphed the moment he appeared on the scene.. No suspense there.No chemistry between the femme fatale and her amours . None , zip , zero , nada.Of course there was plenty of shotgun-toting and gore , bodies splattered everywhere . A distraction from the total lack of a worthy story ? I kept thinking of a vastly superior cops-gone-bad movie , & quot ; Witness & quot ; .Raymond Chandler must be rolling in his grave .	-1
I did n't like this one at all . I finally got up and ordered a pizza and returned later to see if it had gotten any better . It did n't . Kim bassinger is lifeless . She has been and always will be a lady totally bereft of any acting talent whose put on stage because she 's ... and looks good in an evening gown . The whole story is really flat .	-1
I love this movie but hate the format . Have ordered twice now from sellers which advertised DVD as fullscreen . Both times turned ou to be letterbox , which I hate .	-1
I loved Lee Marvin in `` The Iceman Cometh '' , `` Point Blank '' , `` The Killers '' , and `` Cat Ballou '' , and I can understand how he was picked , as former Marine , to play the lead in `` The Big Red One '' . Sadly , though based on Fuller 's experiences , the script and direction substitute cliches for reality . Compounded by poor cinematography , it has all the feel of a cheap , '60s , TV production . If you appreciate , great military films like `` All Quiet on the Western Front '' , `` Das Boot '' , and `` Paths of Glory '' , `` Twelve O'Clock High '' , then you will not be rewarded by `` The Big Red One '' . ( I donated my copy to the library . )	-1
The butchered theatrical version is in 1080p - the ( flawed , but admirable , and definitely superior ) reconstructed version is NOT ! Admittedly , the hi-def screencaps of the feature look great , miles ahead of the DVD , but the decision to offer only the theatrical cut in hi-def is a mystifying and deeply frustrating one . This movie deserved a lot better and Warner usually does a lot better , but this just reminds me of the lack of respect they 've shown Ken Russell 's catalogue.TBRO is `` semi-autobiographical , '' so how biographical is that ? While Fuller represents himself over a quartet of fictional characters , all the major campaigns and incidents are represented in his autobiography 'A Third Face ' - an essential read , by the way , as it 's like having Fuller at your elbow telling story after story from his very full life in his inimitable , instantly identifiable and endlessly entertaining way . So until someone does this the right way , I recommend picking up that book and reading it to get the story behind this film . The novelization of The big Red One is also worth reading.I was hot to purchase this until I found out that the reconstruction was in standard def . Forget it .	-1
Terrible . Absolutely terrible . The 4 and 5 star ratings here are shocking , but I assume you are rabid Stephen King fans who were re-living the book as you watched the movie . I did n't read the book , so the movie had to stand on its own . This is no reflection on Stephen King because his books are so much deeper and more complicated than can be portrayed in a movie , nevertheless , this is still terrible.Yes this movie is `` old '' , but that 's no excuse for this . The characters were weird , the acting was bland , and the ending was laughable . I only watched the end because I had so much time invested in it . No doubt the book was exponentially better than this movie . How could n't it be ? I have read enough of his books to know that his supernatural horror books have rarely translated well into movies ( with a few exceptions ) . Misery , for example , was a great movie , but it was a thriller , not a horror movie.My recommendation is to skip the movie and read the book ; or spend 3 hours cleaning your gutters , it 'll be much more satisfying .	-1
i am so disappointed by this movie . this is nothing like the book . the casting was done horribly . i think the only people who were even cast correctly as thier discription in the book was Richie ( played by seth green ) and bill ( the kid from the never ending story ) . everybody else did n't even look the the way they should . like stanely uris ' mom . she should n't been fat in the movie she was an skinny old lady . dam n't kids ca n't we just do what the book says ...	-1
Stephen King 's `` It '' had potential to be a pretty good horror movie , but it ultimately fails to follow up on its early moments of horror that it creates . Pennywise is creepy at times and other times , he is stupid , but overall , he is a convincing horror movie villain who symbolizes evil.One of the biggest problems this movie has is that there is so much reminiscing by the individual characters and that overshadows the actual present action of the movie ... this hurts the movie in my opinion and drags the movie out longer than it needed to be . I understand that a certain amount of looking or dreaming into the past is necessary in order to make the movie work , but I think this part is overdone and the viewer really has a hard time ascertaining the essence of the horror that the movie is trying to create.The acting is not bad at all , but the directing is poor at times , especially in the end . The biggest criticism that I have for this movie is that with the somewhat scary atmosphere that this movie is able to create throughout the movie , it all comes to not and is pretty much destroyed by the movie 's ending which is absolutely ridiculous because the manifestation of this monster in the end is a total joke.Pennywise , as a clown , was creepy enough , but this monster in the end looks ridiculous and is completely unconvincing . The ending makes the movie look like a farce if you take it on face value . I mean a big spider ? ? That 's pretty lame folks and makes what could of been a good horror movie into an average horror movie , at best . I give this movie a rather weak TWO stars for the creepiness that is built up throughout the movie , but the ending deserves ZERO stars .	-1
I gave this movie 2 stars only because John Ritter was in it . I would have given it 5 stars if Don Knotts was in it . But it sucked anyway ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'm gon na be like the two reviewers below and make constant exclamation points ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
( There may be minor spoilers herein ) The book 'It ' is one of Stephen King 's most enduring classics even if it is 500 pages too long . He establishes strong characters , strong scenarios , and frightening attacks over 1138 well-developed pages . The book is massive and gets silly at times , like most of King 's work , but it still has the strength and power to outlast any minor issue.The movie , on the other hand , is not so good . Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace , John Carpenter 's close friend ( editing Halloween and The Fog amongst other credits ) , the film lacks the power and depth that the book contained due to it 's strange array of actors and overacting children with wooden dialog.There are good parts of the story however . Most of the 'Stand By Me'-esque story is done fairly well , considering . But where the story really seems strong is with the adults ; most of the time . The ending is a bastardization of King 's original story , making me cringe and wonder why there was ever a 30 year wait to try and destroy THAT evil.But the best part of this film adaptation is Pennywise the Dancing Clown as portrayed by Tim Curry , who plays the murdering vampiric clown with evil glee . He is most definitely the best part of the movie which makes it upsetting when he shows up sporadically . But when he does show up , he most certainly steals the scene.Since this is the only adaptation of 'It ' out there , its definitely not the worst thing in the world , like I said , there are good parts . But it does n't live up to the story and themes in the book . Themes that are as poignant as ever , no matter where and when you grew up . Themes of childhood , adulthood , and corruption . Themes of a dark town that hides it 's evil secrets in a blurred past . The movie misses this , even at it 's extended length . I can see how the film is loved ; it 's a nostalgic viewing for many . But for those of us who wish to remove those rose-tinted glasses , we see how flawed the film truly is .	-1
This movie is so far off from the book its not even funny ! ! Pennywise 's suit is wrong , they added stuff in , took stuff out , put the events in the wrong order and in the wrong settings , etc . The acting is horrible ( except for tim curry ) so all in all , its just BAD ! B-A-D ! I absolutely loved the book and was looking forward to seeing this movie , and I was pretty [ darned ] dissapointed ! Stay away from this movie at all costs and just read the book .	-1
All right , after having watched this again this weekend , I 've come to the conclusion that it just is n't that good . There is a lot of good lead-up , and even some good creepy moments during the first half . However , there just is n't enough background to understand the overall take of the movie . I found the ending was both abrupt and unclear.If this had been given the full mini-series treatment that `` The Stand '' received , it probably would have equalled it in quality ( which was pretty good ) . However , this film was just too short to give adequate coverage of the story . If we 'd seen more and longer details of the childrens ' lives , it might have made more sense in the overall scheme of things - instead we get memory moments for each of them which are fleeting and not very descriptive . They only serve to say `` This happened back then , '' rather than giving you a true feeling of what exactly went wrong.Tim Curry was good , but because no one really is given enough time to expand a character , his evil clown act comes off as being angry and stupid rather than creepy and threatening.I ca n't really say that this is worth buying . If you 're a die-hard SK fan and you are curious , rent it . Otherwise , you 're better off with another choice . Like The Stand.T	-1
At this point in time , the Hammer-Dracula series should have been put into the coffin for good ! Breaking tradition , Dracula is put into a modern setting amongst groovy 70 's party-dudes and babes , one of them ( the busty Stephanie Beacham ) , just so happens to be grandaughter of Professor Van Helsing ... and guess who comes looking for her to avenge her grandad 's wrongdoings ? You guessed it ... the bloodshot-eyed , contact wearing Christopher Lee . Although this is a terrible film , its kind of campy if you look at as a ( ahem ) & quot ; period piece. & quot ; Dig that extra-cool soundtrack too !	-1
Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Are Awesome this movie is n't , A Plain bore that pretends to be cool with silly smelly Hippies and a Awful band , I hate the tie-in of it , only the two heavyweight actors are worth watching the movie , Thank God the days of Free Love ( STD 'S anyone ? ) and Awful folk music are over , Look elsewhere for Scares or A Good Dracula Film .	-1
Hammer really plumbed the depths with this & quot ; updated & quot ; entry in their Dracula series . Not even the considerable talents of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing ( which could make a commercial for potato chips thrilling ) can save this pic from the trash heap . The acting , previously mentioned thesps excepted , is terrible . The attempts at making the film relevant ( you know , hip , man ! ) only serve to hasten its turning old and rotten . The score has a way of causing the teeth to rattle . The sound of metal pole being struck with a baseball bat would be preferable . All in all , this is a terrible film that makes one long for the earlier days of Hammer . For a much better '70 's vampire flick try COUNT YORGA , VAMPIRE or see if you can obtain a copy of the ultra-rare GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE .	-1
when this movie starts it is so dark you ca n't even see anything . The only way you can know what is going on it to read what Amazon tells you.After that it is just stupid .	-1
We usually love romance films but this got ta be one of the worst we 've ever seen . It 's extremely slow and boring and predictable .	-1
If you like the book like I did , you will HATE this movie . What a terrible adaptation !	-1
SPHERE is one of those movies that you watch , thinking , how can such a talented actor as Dustin Hoffman find himself in this quixotic , eccentric and ill-conceived movie . Dustin tries , but can not pull off this role , as the script offers nowhere to go . Crichton 's novel was equally confusing , but not as blatantly as the film version . Samuel L. Jackson sleepwalks ( again ) through a role that could have been pivotal ; Sharon Stone does well considering she 's not given the opportunity to explore her mental imbalance , and there 's no chemistry whatsoever in her scenes with Hoffman . Peter Coyote needs to stick to voice-overs in commercials ; he portrays all his character 's emotions on one level -- flat . Director Barry Levinson has crafted some beautiful scenes ; the sphere is gorgeous ; and some of the action scenes are riveting . Too bad there 's nothing to support this . With one of Crichton 's best novels ( Timeline ) coming to the screens later this month , I hope Richard Donner and crew breathe a little more life than that deoxygenated in SPHERE .	-1
Boy , can Michael Chrichton write a bad movie . This one ranks up there with Mortal Combat : Annihilation , Steel Dawn , or the 13th warrior ( also by : guess who ? ) . The movie starts off pretty interesting , i wont bother to write it all down , just read someone else 's reviews for the particulars . But what amazed me was the movie 's innability to do ANYTHING with the material it was given . The scene where the alien talks to the crew over some sort of typing program is pretty neat , but then when they explain who is really typing to them later in the movie it makes absolutly no sense ( watch it yourself , pay attention to the placement of letters and the contridiction with the explanation they give ) . The acting in the movie sometimes resembled an episode of & quot ; who 's line is it anyway & quot ; where the actors just stood and one place and threw random lines at eachother . I remember one night at the theatre when me and my friends were arguing whether to go see & quot ; sphere & quot ; or drive to a another theatre 30 miles away that was playing & quot ; as good as it gets & quot ; . All i will say is that I 'm totally happy that we made the right decision .	-1
This movie starts off with an extremely fascinating plot : a vessel has been located 1000 feet down on the ocean floor ; its very large - a fin alone is 100 feet tall ; it has a perfect sphere inside.These items alone would give any competent film-maker the necessary material for a very good movie . Not-so the makers of Sphere.A great deal of the movie is spent dazzling the viewer with very good special-effects . An equal amount of time should have been spent including many of the dialogues , from Crichton 's book , the crew has with the alien intelligence . As it is , the movie does drag . As compensation , of a sort , I did learn a lot about the toxic properties of marine life on the ocean floor , and thats worth something ! The DVD picture is beautifully clear , and the 6 ( uh ... 5.1 ) channels of digital sound will put your home-theater system , and your neighbors , through their paces.For a Science-fiction fanatic like myself it was okay . It should have been Great ! ! END	-1
This movie started out well with promise of being an intriguing sci-fi . Unfortunately , the interest soon wore off and it became apparent that & quot ; Sphere & quot ; is just a repackaged version of various other alien orientated movies . It 's & quot ; Abyss & quot ; , & quot ; Alien & quot ; and & quot ; 2001 & quot ; thrown together with a couple of different actors . We have a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean and there is something malevolant on board that starts to manipulate the crew . Yawn ! It drags on and on and on with characters doing things for no particular reason . Why did Jackson enter the giant gold golf ball from outer space on a whim ? Why , seeing what it had done to Jackson did Hoffmann follow him ... and hang on ! What was Hoffmann doing in this rubbish anyway ? I mean you can see the other maronic actors taking the job but why dear old Dustin ? He must have a severe gambling debt , or something ! This film did n't require his talent ! ! ! However it was adequately suited to Stone 's and jackson 's lack thereof ! There is supposed to be some interesting & quot ; past & quot ; for Stone and Hoffman but it just does n't work in the film . It is not intriguing and after the two or so hors when it reaches it 's climax , you are asleep anyway . This is a very poor movie . OK , so it has & quot ; effects & quot ; but which movie these days does n't . That means it deserves nothing above a 1 star . Give this one a miss !	-1
Pretty violent . The plot really sucks you into the story , and the characters are engaging . Def not a family movie .	-1
I do n't know . I gave this one 35 minutes before I shut it off in frustration . From the plot description , I imagine it was gon na go somewhere I would have enjoyed but I was getting ticked that it was taking so long for anything to happen . Anything ! I imagine I may have cheated myself from some entertaining twistivities but do n't make me wait more than a half hour to even warm up ! I mean , NOTHING was happening of interest ! I 'm a deep thinker . I can appreciate elaborate plots , the necessary setup , the look into how a dark mind is forged but ... nope . Could n't last the warmup .	-1
I waited and waited to be drawn into this story . It did n't happen . I have sat entranced through MY DINNER WITH ANDRE , so I have an open and generous mind for a movie -- - but Butcher Boy did not work for me . Some boyhood-surrealist themes work -- -- CINEMA PARADISO -- but with those you know you are watching surrealism ; Butcher Boy never establishes its genre.I also am uncomfortable with the movie 's un-judged acceptance of a boy `` hero '' whose response to a father 's brutality is to adore the father and glibly rechannel his true feelings into brutally murdering another woman -- - hello ? I thought we had dealt with this kind of neurotic evasion a long time ago . Nothing I saw in the movie suggests that Neil Jordan is conscious of what he 's saying .	-1
Sometimes actors and indeed all types of artists seem to have a need to create pieces simply to flatter their own sense of self-importance or vanity . The Postman seems like such a vehicle for Kevin Costner . Maybe not to quite the magnitude that John Travolta 's Battlefield Earth is , but it is still an overly long , dull , and completely ( and needlessly pretentious ) film . I read the reviews and often the `` official '' reviews do n't at all reflect what an average movieviewer would think , so I reserved my opinion until I saw the film for myself , which I eventually did . I am not the biggest fan of Kevin Costner to start with , so this skewed my opinion , but I am definitely a fan of receiving postal mail , so I thought ... well , maybe at least having mail delivered is a good reason to watch the film . From the beginning til the end , the dialogue is totally inane , the characters are one-dimensional , and Costner 's inability to act is at the worst junction of his career . I think the story could have been simpler , and the ending ... oh , heavens to betsy , the ending ! At some point in the film , Costner is enslaved by some sort of tribe that lives by a set of rules . This tribe rides through the land demanding tribute from the villagers . I do not remember the name of this group , but it seems its members were tattooed with certain numbers ( maybe it was 8 ) and any member of the group 8 could at any time challenge the leader of 8 for dominance of the group . Whatever the case , when Costner 's character becomes a slave in this tribe of 8 ( or whatever it is ) he manages to escape , which is when he finds a wrecked postal truck , the skeleton of a dead postman and a bunch of undelivered mail . He dresses in the postal uniform and attempts to deliver mail to a nearby walled-in village , which is greeted by both skepticism and hope . Fair enough . The scene at the end , however , which culminates with the most idiotic fight scene I have ever seen on film , is between Costner , ( who is , naturally , the Postman ) and the leader of this tribe of 8 ( Bethlehem , played by Will Patton who seems relatively unknown although he appears everywhere , including in No Way Out with Kevin Costner . Costner , who is tattooed with the symbol of 8 , challenges this leader to a fight in order to gain leadership himself . You can imagine how hokey and completely unbelievable this is . You can also imagine that Costner wins and creates a new , just , and democratic society ... whatever .	-1
Its baffles me that anyone could think this a 3 star movie , but 5 stars ? This plays like a hodge-podge assembled from two or three different scripts based on different short stories , with casting giving it a PC spin , probably done to try to deflect the deserved harsh criticism . Of course , the entire story of the savior postman is enough to make most sane people embrace the apocalypse.Perhaps if Tom Petty had starred as the singing postman it might have worked better as an intentionally funny send up of pop culture fashioning new messiahs .	-1
I say this is the second worst movie ever made because I actually sat through the whole thing whereas I finally turned off `` Play It to the Bone '' in the last fifteen minutes . Of course , when I was watching `` The Postman '' , I had just had oral surgery and was n't much into moving.Nevertheless , this movie is bad . Imagine a post apocalyptic Pacific Northwest . Think of an odd marriage between an Ewok village and rejects from the cast of `` Road Warrior '' , and you will get the basic feel for the setting of this movie.Kevin Costner finds a bag of undelivered mail and a postal uniform and inexplicably begins to deliver the mail . He becomes a hero to the people , now caught in a struggle between bad guys that look like they did n't make the cut for `` Road Warrior '' and are still upset , and the good American people trying to make the best of their brave new world.Radiation poisoning has sterilized men , so naturally , a local woman and her husband ask Costner to try and impregnate her . He obliges them , but the would-be stepdad is killed two scenes later signaling a romantic interest for Costner.This postal service is propped up by Costner 's lie that the US Government is starting to reform and get itself together , and soon , a bunch of villagers , including the token funny black kid named Lincoln Mercury , are delivering mail.Perhaps the only amusing part of this movie is Tom Petty , playing himself , his post apocalyptic career being the head of a peace loving community . The only reason this is amusing is because I am a huge fan of Tom Petty 's , and someone who is n't will not even care.Not only is the acting horrible , the plot stupid , and the characters difficult to like , but this mess drags on for a very long time . If you want a good post apocalyptic movie , get `` Road Warrior '' and `` Mad Max : Beyond Thunderdome '' . This Costner effort makes `` Water World '' look like a timeless classic , and when you are through watching it , you will conclude that you sat through it at all because it 's just fun to rank on it .	-1
`` The Devils Advocate '' ( 1997 ) I used to like The Devil 's Advocate . I used to think it was everything a movie needed . Then I saw it again , and I can safely say I was n't really that impressed . This movie is necessarily bad , but its not great either , its on the so-so level of filmmaking . But with a great cast , a neat idea and promising adverts , The Devil 's Advocate should 've been much more.I 'll start with the things that really got to me the second time round . One of those things was the acting in the film . Keanu Reeves is not my most favoured actor around today . Unfortunately with The Devil 's Advocate , Keanu can just tick off another character he ca n't play - a lawyer . Reeves provided no suspense or fun with his performance , and he just really bugged me . Charlize Theron overacts horribly . At the start Theron is very good , but after she falls under the spell of the devil ( Pacino ) , her character gets very mentally unstable and Theron goes over the top . Jeffrey Jones 's character was just there to be another infamous cast member , but I thought his character was boring and I did n't find his performance as enjoyable or stylish as his other roles . Pacino is the only leading cast member who is able to find some juiciness to his character , and he is a greatly entertaining Satan . There is no comparison to his other performances , but he 's pretty cool in this role.The lead character is another problem with the film . You might be able to put this under the `` Keanu-Reeves-can't-act-category '' , but Reeve 's Lomax is a dumb leading man who always puts himself first and is a selfish and senseless idiot . I feel this problem may be more with the silly and recycled script than Reeve 's acting , but the film suffered because of it.The ending is probably the worst thing about the movie . Not only is it totally confusing and typical , but it takes the easy way out . The Devil 's Advocate is not a movie that can challenge itself . It always has to finish sequences by taking the quick way instead of giving the audience something to think about.All that said , there is always the stylish directing , some good visuals and special effect sequences , nicely done law scenes ( which are strangled by Reeve 's over-acting ) and a few excellent and very modern editing . The movie looks and feels great . All this is unfortunately mustered and busted by the horrid character development , lots and lots of plot holes and the fact that the film actually has no message . Maybe its good to see how people react to temptation in some scenes , but I came out of the film still really confused about what the movie was actually about and why the hell all the stuff that happened in the film was really happening . So , my conclusion of The Devil 's Advocate is this : a poor excuse to see lots of nudity and sex scenes . Miss this over-long bore , even if Connie Neilsen naked is a bonus.MY GRADE : C	-1
I am truly amazed that this show ever made it to 5 years based off of the pilot . Some of the parts of the movie were a bit campy , but you do have to consider that the technology available to do special effects were limited . The content was ok , but ... I 'm glad B5 was n't judged solely on the Pilot ...	-1
Truly the worst moment in the B5 franchise . Bad acting , bad story , cliche beyond belief . Not even recommended for completists . What were they thinking ? They made G'Kar into a flamboyant , lispy homosexual , just short of wearing a feather boa ( or did he ? ) ...	-1
I have to agree with the other reviewers . `` Legend of the Rangers '' looked promising but ultimately did n't deliver . The sets and effects are excellent and the actinng 's not bad . And of course it was great seeing Andreas Katsulas reprise his role as Narn ambassador , now citizen , G'Kar , however these three elements could n't save the film . The mysterious alien race threatening the Liandra 's crew were too much like the Shadows of the series.If you 're a die-hard B-5 fan you 'll want this film , but if you 're looking for an introduction to B-5 go with the season box sets.All-in-all not JMS ' best . Which is sad because it had promise .	-1
I bought this one because I had a coupon . I had read all the reviews here and saw how they all uniformly panned this TV movie . But I had nothing else to watch ! Yet I have to say , that I found it to be just right for light late Friday Night movie fare . You really ca n't expect them to top the Shadow War -- so everything that comes out of the Bab 5 Universe will always be overshadowed ( Pun not intended ) The `` We live for the One , We die for the One '' line was eye-rolling overkill . Fortunately , you can sense when the script is getting ready to barf it up and you can go : Yeah-Yeah , Rah-Rah , [ Fast Forward ] and not miss anything of value.And as for the Weapons Tech -- That bit actually made me LAUGH . In my mind , the mistake made was that they did not follow the general SCI-FI rule for Fighting Females . She should have been dressed in a MinBari leather Battle Bikini or something . Then the male half of the audience would have accepted the antics with quiet concentration . Hey -- it works for the Star Trek Universe ! Beyond that , I was intrigued by the notion of a billion year old bad guy . Obviously , this TV movie was a pilot attempt that never bore fruit . But what the hey -- Straczynski already hit one home run past the corporate entertainment suits . Win some- Lose some .	-1
After reading more reviews about The Searchers I had to watch this movie again to see what I was missing ... and it continues to disappoint . If you are a true fan of the pre-1960 's western film style , especially with John Wayne and his typical band of old horse opera cronies [ Ward Bond , Patrick Wayne , Ken Curtis & Harry Carey Jr. ] then you may really like it . Unfortunately I still found the opening vistas of Monument Valley to be the most exciting part of this movie . The combination of too many sappy/cheesy moments , such as the wedding fight scene between Jeffrey Hunter and Ken Curtis , and actual native Americans only being used in minor , uncredited supporting roles , hurt this movie badly . They took The Searchers way off point , cost the movie its credibility , and seriously reminded me of F-Troop . I really wanted to like The Searchers , and I have tried watching it several times , but each time it peters out about 1/4 of the way into the story and I just ca n't finish viewing it in one continuous sitting . The cinematography is excellent , the opening scenes are great , but after that you can place The Cowboys or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance in the DVD player and watch better examples of John Wayne 's work with fresher , stronger actors like Bruce Dern , Jimmy Stewart , and Lee Marvin . For my money 's worth , Shane is still the best western ever made .	-1
the indians show up and the one who is apparently to grab the little girl is obviously a white guy with utterly lame 'indian ' makeup on . I just ca n't stand this kind of crap . It 's what makes so many of these old westerns unwatchable . Plus the comic relief 'old guy ' is pitiful .	-1
Finally , this convoluted film makes sense ... Ethan 's five year search was not , primarily , for his niece ( more accurately his daughter ; consider the bedroom-eyes between Ethan and Martha Edwards , and Aaron 's awareness of the escaping pheromones -- - > that 's why Aaron shoves precious Debbie out the window but keeps the other two kids with him ) . But , I digress.Ethan had no intention of performing an 'honor killing ' . He was on a more profound quest . He sensed that time was fickle.Look carefully at Chapter 30 ... you will see an automobile driving along the river road behind the troops fording the frozen stream . Note , also , the backhoe tracks in the snow ( plowed trail and the mounds of ice ) . Ethan quietly noticed all of this , and more . The Brazos River blurring into the San Juan ; flowing one way , then 'tuther ' ... or Texas morphing into Monument Valley . Or riding like hell for years only to end up a half mile from Edwards ' cabin . Materializing Navajo blanket on the hitching-post in the opening scene . The sun 's erratic motion . Look's/Martin 's 'honeymoon/divorce ' camp beside the reservoir , only a few hundred yards from Jorgensen 's future ranch house . Laurie 's red label Levis . Consider the way the Navajo-speaking Comanches decamped and re-camped in the twinkling of an eye in the final battle . These are but a few of the reasons Ethan looks so angry , perplexed and confused throughout the film ... People , objects , buttes and mesas were materializing and de-materializing right before his eyes from the opening scenes . Nothing made sense.Unfortunately , Ethan 's collaborations with not-yet-conceived physicist Hermann Weyl were cut by the film 's editor . What was he really searching for ? Exigent Ethan was 'searching ' for wormholes ... gates through which he could rearrange the family 's tree , and his place beside Martha . What was Ethan doing during the three `` lost '' years ? Studying holes . They were scattered all over the place . Scar , obviously not of Native American descent , was a pharaohic high priest of the Ancient Mysteries . Alas , Aaron 's pesky adopted son kills him . It is Sca'R of Thebes who Ethan sought . He would have to find another initiate . Five years utterly wasted . Wasted ! Perhaps Debbie knows ... perhaps she possesses a key . She must survive.Why does Ethan turn and stumble away from the reunion in the final act ? He knows something they do n't , and he knows he can not tell them . All of the cows and horses that were beside the water , which they had just ridden past , have up and disappeared.Classic sci-fi masterpiece . Remarkably ahead of its time , subtle and universally misunderstood .	-1
Let me just start out by saying that I was literally raised on the Addams Family . I can recall looking through Charles Addams ' Homebodies before any other cartoon book . The original TV series was a favorite in our house . The first 2 movies were a delightful surprise of good acting , directing and and one liners from the old Charles Addams New Yorker cartoons.So when I saw that Tim Curry was playing Gomez in this made-for-VHS version I snapped it up ; should have noted it co-starred Darrel Hanna . The same thing hit me every time she was on camera , `` Oh god , that Darrel Hanna in a back wig ! '' This is undoubtedly the most unfunny movies I 've ever seen . I do n't think there 's one single adult laugh . OK , maybe one . The reason I 'm giving it 2 stars as opposed to one is that it actually has merit as the most painful movie I 've ever sat through and for THAT it 's memorable.I recommend it as a white elephant gift , birthday present for you annoying mother-in-law or a sure fire way to get your kids to go to bed . `` But mom , ca n't we watch just one more movie ! ? '' `` It 's a school night , but OK just one more . We 'll watch Addams Family Reunion . '' `` Yawn , it IS late . Good night mom . ''	-1
OK , I saw it . Made it thru pretty much . Yes I was right it did suck pretty bad . Supriseingly Hannah was pretty good . I think she tried to get to the original Morticia . While she is obviously no Angelica Huston she would have been good if I had not seen AH first . Tim Curry totally sucked . Whats her name who played Wednesday could not hope to shine Christina Ricchie 's boots . Fester was lame too but who could possibly live up to Christopher Loyd ? So just do n't bother , there are only 2 Addams family movies .	-1
From the lovely people who have conned you for years , comes another reduction of an international film scaled down to easily consumed bites by the people who hate you . Wim Wenders masterpiece & quot ; Wings of Desire & quot ; has been re-made . Why not ? Gus has re-made & quot ; Psycho & quot ; and I 've heard Bergman 's greats are under revision as well . Has Hollywood finally become this pathetic ? Surprise ! History has always been written by the most underhanded and greedy . & quot ; Wings of Desire & quot ; was the upside to the only slightly less successful & quot ; Far Away , So Close & quot ; . The upside , of course , is always more profitable . With the success of the inhumane series & quot ; Touched by an Angel & quot ; , certain suits saw Wender 's international hit as an idiot 's goldmine . The stars are redundant . Box-office ecstasy ! There is only a skeleton here of the ORIGINAL , as angels and humans alike deal with more & quot ; carnal & quot ; concerns . Unfortunately , the only telling critique I can give is to compare it to the original ( and the sequal ) , but subtitles are so hard to read . Maybe it is best , after all , to swallow . ( By the way , 1 star is the lowest I am allowed to give ) .	-1
I love , love , love `` Wings of Desire . '' I went to see this remake hoping it would at least approach Wim Wenders 's ethereal vision and joy.Shot `` Wings of Desire '' in the kneecaps is the feeling I left the theater with . Dark , dismal and downright appalling.Please , please , please see `` Wings of Desire '' before you comment on this movie . You 'll be doing yourself and everyone else a favor .	-1
An angel of death ( Nicolas Cage ) falls in love with a surgeon ( Meg Ryan ) and wishes he were a real man.I like love stories , but this was just too corny for me . Meg overdoes her perky-girl-next-door persona . When she flashes her big trademark grin or lets a single tear trickle ever-so-slowly down her beautiful face , it feels like she 's just posing . I did n't buy her as a real person ; there 's too much staring thoughtfully into the camera and spouting trite dialogue . And who races downhill on a bike at the edge of a cliff with no hands and eyes closed ? I 'm still wondering why Nic Cage is a star . He plays the same gosh-gee-whiz angel that Brad Pitt did inMeet Joe Blackminus Brad 's good looks , charm , and sex appeal . His unwavering nobility is way too precious and those lingering close-ups - please ! The movie is burdened with a clich & eacute ; d script that constantly implores us to Appreciate Life ! Dare to Love ! Reach Out and Touch Someone ! Eat a Pear While There 's Still Time ! There is nothing to balance the sticky sentimentality except for Dennis Franz as an annoying ex-angel . I liked the use of the beautiful song , `` In the Arms of an Angel , '' but ca n't recommend this movie .	-1
TERRIBLE ! Was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . My girlfriend and I went to see it at the movies and neither one of us said anything the whole movie but after it was over we both said that we wanted to walk out . We both hated it , and she usually cries at these type of movies . She did not shed a tear . It was not a long movie , but it seemed to drag forever . You do not get emotionally involved with the characters at all.Do not buy this , do not even watch it . There are much better things to do with your time . BEWARE !	-1
*Warning : Spoiler*I can not believe people , excuse me , some women are giving this movie four and five stars.Interesting premise , and it could have been a good , believeable movie -- but it was sooo syrupy . If this is what it 's like to be in love , please somebody shoot me ( note : I 've been in real love for 27 years now . ) I got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a 3 and a half until the very end . Why the blankity-blank-blank does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a `` good movie '' ? I felt like I was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over . Would n't it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out ? That , at least , would have made the movie more intriquing , believeable and redeeming . If ever a movie was made to force tears , this is it.This movie stinks and I do n't mind telling you so -- and it 's not just because I 'm a man either . Imo , there 's not much difference between this movie and a stupid , blatant Steven Segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it 's the elixir of heaven . Same coin , different sides.The movie should be given a `` one '' -- no a `` negative one '' just for the stupid ending , but other redeeming factors make it a `` two . '' Still not worth seeing -- i.e. , unless you 're into infuriating yourself . ** Note : Even my wife and daughter -- both chick-flick connousiours -- hate this movie.I have n't checked yet , but I think my dogs do too . **Another note : These two good actors needed a better movie . See Ryan in the superb `` Courage Under Fire '' , or the Jim Morrison movie , or `` When Harry Met Sally '' -- which I do n't categorize as a `` chick flick '' but as a good romantic comedy , i.e. , not contrived.And Nicholas Cage , star of the greatest movie of all time ( Raising Arizona ) , I 'm so tired of him I wan na puke . Anytime I see a movie trailer with him starring in it my unconscious immediately thinks `` Nicholas Cage stars in it ? ... Not wasting my money on that one . ''	-1
I thought ( from the previews ) that this would be so much more . I felt it had great potential in the start-up , but as it progressed , it just fizzled out.I would even go so far as to say that Matt Dillon was not at his best in this role -- and felt the chemistry between the male/female leads lacking.To sum up , Mr . Wonderful was not the `` wonderful '' romantic comedy that I anticipated .	-1
Got my Music Man Blu Ray disk in a hurry . Problem is it does n't work on any blu ray player I 've tried it on . There 's the deal .	-1
I saw this movie a day after I saw `` The Fugitive '' . This movie had alot of laughs . Like the Marshall who is supposed to play the Tommy Lee Jones character was halarious , they made fun of him very well . I also like Leslie Nielson style of comedy . The thing is in the last 15 minutes the movie just stops being funny . This is n't one of the best Parodys I have seen . Go see some of his better movies like The Naked Gun and Airplane . Overall see this movie if you want some good laughs but when its over you wo n't be totally satisfied .	-1
Wrongfully accused is the dumbest comedy that I have ever watched . The jokes where far and few between , and most of them so corny you had to think a minute before erupting ( or not ) into laughter . Or tears of frustration that you actually paid good money on something so cheesy.Unlike Hot Shots , Wrongfully accused has to walk a long way to discover the formula to make us interested . The plot was lame and the acting even more so . Except for Micheal York who died ten minutes into the film anyhow . What a bummer.Unless overused jokes tickle your funny bone , I do n't think this one is up your alley . Believe me when I say that this was likely the longest film I ever watched without finding a glimmer of laughter or sense of good scripting.Do n't rent , do n't buy , let Wrongfully accused stay that way .	-1
I love Leslie Nielsen especially the Naked Gun series but this movie is just awful . No belly laughs . No laughs . Maybe a chuckler here and there but that 's it . Save your money .	-1
Wow . I thought I was in for a treat when I saw the previews for & quot ; The Avengers. & quot ; At least the previews were entertaining . The beginning of the movie started out pretty good , but it was downhill from there.Can we say , & quot ; movie turns into a fashion show ? & quot ; For crying out loud , every single time Uma left a scene and came back , she had on a new hot little number for an outfit . If I wanted to see a fashion show , I would have stayed home and turned on my cable.I absolutely love Ralph Fiennes and Sean Connery . Most of what they have done I have found wonderful . I was sorely disappointed by Sean Connery 's role in this movie . His lines were stilted , he seemed extremely uncomfortable in what he was doing , and I started to feel sorry for him midway through the movie . Was this supposed to happen ? I do n't know.I do understand that this movie was supposed to represent the quirkiness of the original TV show , but I did n't buy it . Perhaps it was starting to grate on my nerves every time Uma showed up in a different tight-fitting outfit.The special effects were about the only redeeming quality in the entire movie . The bubbles they walked in , those big mechanical bees , and the high-flying act at the end were all pretty dang cool . I just wanted more out of the characters . I wanted more out of the plot . I wanted more out of Sean Connery 's villain . I wanted more out of the relationship between Uma and Ralph . Perhaps I wanted too much , but when coming right down to the nitty gritty , that 's usually what the criteria is for making what most people consider a & quot ; good & quot ; movie .	-1
I got caught up in the nostalgia and hype when this movie was first released . I 'm one of the few people who actually saw it in the theaters . The line that best describes this movie came from another reviewer ( ca n't remember who ) : & quot ; Not only does The Avengers make you think that the filmmakers never MADE a movie before , it makes you think they 've never even SEEN a movie before. & quot ; That about sums it up . The film has a temporal problem - it 's a 90 's movie that 's a remake of a 60 's tv show and it 's not entirely sure what decade it 's in . It looks kind of 60s-ish then it looks kind of like it 's taking place in modern times . The generic 60 's English thugs with the mod haircuts look like they 've been on ice for a few decades.Sean Connery is pretty much wasted in the title role . He 's blustery and over the top , but it 's mostly a great sound and fury signifying nothing . Connery 's not nearly as wasted as Ralph Finnes ( excellent in Strange Days ) . Uma Thurman shows that she ca n't hold a candle to Diana Rigg . She ends up in the leather catsuit but does n't have much to do once she 's in it.There are some odd bits in the middle where the movie gives a nod to some of the more mind-twisting elements of the series , but with no real effect . The cgi killer-robot bees are at best laughable and at worst downright embarrasing.The final mano-a-mano battle royal at then end is pretty forgettable .	-1
Seeing Sean Connery in such a silly role is kind of worth it just as proof that it actually happened . Otherwise , I was surprised to see that Eddie Izzard is in this as well but is completely wasted as they gave him only one line in the entire movie - come on , he is a stand-up comedian ! Anyway , silly story , not greatly acted , and sub-par pacing makes this one to avoid for the most part .	-1
Let 's face it ... this movie is terrible , whether or not you compare it to the brilliant sixties series . I went in with an open mind , knowing that Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg will always be John Steed and Emma Peel . I thought the addition of Sean Connery as the villain would be a delight . WRONG . The tv shows ' wonderful theme by Laurie Johnson is used quietly in a couple of scenes , but the main theme is another one of those preprogrammed pieces of musical nothingness . Uma Thurman acted like she was on Prozac and Ralph Fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was John Steed . And Sean , what a lousy performance..you know you could have done better . I did like the mechanical bees sequence ; the only true original touch in the movie . The teddy bears was preposterous and almost worked , but since the whole movie was such a drag , I 'm not sure anything could save it . Macnee was smart in his invisible cameo role . Too bad Uma did n't back out and get replaced by a more lively Mrs. Peel .	-1
How can you improve on perfection ? The original series with Diana Rigg was one of the best ever . It was campy , perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design , worldview , and style , and told good , short stories . It was a wonderful world unto itself.By contrast , this film tries for camp without synching with the times , for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces ( Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension , but everything else was implied , never shown ) , and for a weird yet believable story . But it fails utterly.This film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book . Not only do Fiennis and THurman utterly lack chemistry , in spite of their great talent , but the plot is simply and stupidly unbelievable . I think that this is the worst tv-remake I have ever seen . That answers the question : you should n't try to exploit perfection by slapping together a stupid film.Not recommended . THere are far better things to waste one 's time on .	-1
i love the avengers ... of course i 'm talking about the tv show.patrick macnee and diana rigg were always charming and sly , making the plot almost secondary , but always interesting.now on to the movie ... .mr.fiennes and ms.thurman are neither charming or sly , and neither they nor the plot is interesting . even sean connery , the BRILLIANT sean connery , who has given us such memorable performances in such movies as : the rock , medicine man and , of course , bond , james bond , this time just gives us a headache . the basic plot is that sean , playng the villian , sir august dewinter ( subtle ) wants to control the weather . the sad thing is even after you watch the movie , you 're not really sure why . there 's also an & quot ; emma peel & quot ; twin on the loose , and poor patrick macnee as the invisible guest . do n't ask me to explain it , really ... it 's just so ... i ca n't even say contrived , that would give the plot too much depth..it 's more like a defrosting refridgerator with the food left in . and is it just a coincedence that uma has been in the two worst films of all time , ( & quot ; batman & amp ; robin & quot ; being the king , and this coming a close second ! ) , or is this a case of the odor in the elevator every time she 's in it . i do n't know , but all i do know is , DO N'T WASTE TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS ! ! ! ! not even connery could save this one .	-1
As soon as I saw that Ralph Fiennes ' head was too small for his bowler , I knew `` The Avengers '' was going to be a mess . Terribly miscast as superspy John Steed -- Fiennes is charmless in the role that Patrick MacNee so ably brought to life on television -- he resembles a child wearing his father 's hat ( and not too happy about it ) . Uma Thurman fares little better . While she was terrific in both `` Kill Bill '' films , she 's way out of her league looks-wise and charisma-wise when compared to Diana Rigg 's simply scrumptious Emma Peel . And then there 's the story , or what passes for it , something about a scene-chewing though not particularly convincing Sean Connery controlling the world 's weather . Director Jeremiah Chechik and whoever is willing to take the blame for the script get some of the surface details of `` The Avengers '' formula right but completely miss the boat with regard to the TV series ' wit , style , and sophistication , another ( typical ) modern misstep of focusing on form and ignoring substance . To be fair , a lot apparently was cut from the film before its release , but it 's hard to imagine anything salvaging `` The Avengers '' -- and the DVD is sans deleted scenes , so the point is moot . Eddie Izzard pops up looking like a mod , shrunken Oliver Reed but gets the film 's best line , though a brief sight gag featuring `` Mother , '' the spy agency boss , also actually made me chuckle with the film and not at it . At least poor Patrick MacNee was smart enough to make sure his cameo did not require him to actually show up on screen ; Diana Rigg was smarter for turning the film down outright . Why anyone bothered to remake `` The Avengers '' is beyond me , as the show worked fine as it was , and I ca n't think of any actors today who could embody Steed and Peel as well as the originals .	-1
What a mess . I was so disappointed by this film ( especially since I invited a group of friends out to see it ) . There 's got to be a story behind how this movie self-destructed.And it 's too bad , because , when it came out , THE AVENGERS could 've out-sluethed both Austin Powers and James Bond . It could have had the bizarre Avengers flair with the 007 intrigue and thrills.Personally , I thought Uma Thurman was a mistake as Mrs. Peel , only because the built-in audience ( those familiar with the popular British TV show ) would 've expected an English girl.Ralph Fiennes is a great choice and Sean Connery should have been the ultimate villian.But the movie is incomprehensible.I 'd read that the director was relatively new , having directed only a couple of small , independent films . Was he overwhelmed by the massive production or did the studio take it away from him to cut it to pieces ? What makes me wonder if it was the former is that Sean Connery 's first scenes have him talking with weird , exaggerated tics and such -- and then they 're gone . Connery just walks through the rest of the film . I 've always heard that Connery did not suffer fools on a movie set : did he turn on his young director ? I 've read the script ( which is available online ) and I 'm still wondering just what in the world happened to this film. & quot ; Mrs. Peel , we STILL need you ! & quot ;	-1
Danny Glover and Mel Gibson are terrific . Chris Rock survives on his big , vulgar mouth , Very abrasive . I was very disappointed that Glover 's character was harboring illegal immigrants . I was upset seeing an anti-NRA propaganda poster . No person , group or organization has done more to save children 's lives than the NRA.As soon as I saw the poster on the wall in the 'police department ' I ejected the disc and dropped it in the trash	-1
In the direction we see a burgeoning auteur . I do n't think this film quite holds up today but nonetheless a Bluray viewing is mandatory.I do think it would be average with critics if it came out today because the acting is only okay , the editing is average , and many of the film 's best scenes are too subdued for their own good , too low budget for me to really take them in . Malick today would really make this film sing imo.By this I mean the picture is dated . Many pictures from the 70s are not dated to this point . This one sadly does n't make that list in my opinion . We have done killer films better before and since . I will admit that Malick was young and I respect what he did at this point in time and even what he tried to do . That does n't have anything to do with valid criticism though.And beyond that , these characters are not very well written or believable in any realistic context , and even Malick is nowhere near his best , which , should be obvious for any young filmmaker at this point in time of a career . His cuts and transitions leave a lot to be desired if you are coming from his later films.The direction and cinematography here , while sufficient and very well done in places , simply can not mask the mediocre writing and the way the actors approach the script . It does have some beautiful scenes no doubt and Malick does his best with the material as a director , but something here is n't doing it for me.I bet if he revisited this material today we would see a true masterpiece .	-1
I purchased Badlands expecting a widescreen presentation on par with Days of Heaven or Thin Red Line . Not so . It says 1:85 Widescreen on box but the movie is in pan and scan . And very grainy besides . There seems to be an earlier version with both formats . Get this instead.The movie itself . Seems as if Malick is trying to create a boring , poorly acted , pointless movie . If it has artistic or other redeeming features they are beyond me . But I only went to college for 8 years so what do I know . See the Starkweather bio instead for real horror .	-1
I just could n't appreciate the characters . Fine actors playing jerks . Nice cinematography . Natural Born Killers was much more fun . Worth a watch but this disk will go into the give away pile .	-1
this was a pretty lame attempt at depicting charles starkweather without actually saying that it was , but I knew .	-1
I chose this movie because Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actors , but this was n't quite what I expected .	-1
I defy anyone to explain the story of this movie without stammering and possibly giggling . This movie is boring . It has no energy . Even really bad movies have energy , but this one 's just a rock . They managed to make a boring story out of supernatural people . Congratulations . Also , they managed to make us feel comfortable with Sandra killing a guy . And then we see her SOOOOO upset about her upbringing that it causes her to ... open a store ! And what 's with that & quot ; he 'll have these color eyes , & quot ; thing , and then the guy does n't have the right color ! Nice touch .	-1
As someone who actually cares a lot about the environment , I am usually a pretty easy sell on the idea that oil companies are evil . However , I did n't buy the nonsense that this silly , illogical piece of fluff was peddling to the audience . `` On Deadly Ground '' stars Michael Caine as the demonic head of an oil company . He was the sole shining star in this stinker of a movie . How he ever got talked into starring in this film is one of the greatest mysteries known to man . Caine 's character was really scummy but you almost had to like him since he was the only one with any acting skill up on the screen.Steven Seagal , who also directed and produced this film , was his usual one note superhero/killing machine character that he always is . He single-handedly seemed to be killing more people than any oil spill has ever done.The plot is simply laughable . Evidently , some oil companies purposely sabotage their own drilling facilities , hold press conferences where the reporters do n't ask any questions , and even murder unarmed Eskimos in front of dozens of witnesses without batting an eye . Please . `` On Deadly Ground '' may have been trying to pass on an important message but it went about it the wrong way . People who go to the movies do n't want to spend their hard earned money watching something that looks and sounds like propaganda . There is also so much violence in this movie that it 's hard to swallow the `` harmony with nature '' ideas that are presented to us . Perhaps Seagal should have toned down the massacre just a touch . Watch `` Under Siege '' if you want to see Seagal at top form .	-1
Not even multi-academy award winner Michael Caine could save this movie from Steven Seagals acting deficiencies . Who ever heard of the last name Seagal , in reality it was little Stevie Segal getting kicked around everyday on the playground . You can look at him in this movie and tell that he knows the real meaning of a swirlie . The plot , there was n't one . The action was formulaic . Seagals acting , well it could have been worse , it could have been Van Damme . The movie does , however , answers one question . If you 've ever wondered if akido was good exercise , just check out the gut on Seagal .	-1
Very dumb plot and silly acting ; no one to really give a darn about so ya just do n't care who gets offed .	-1
Oh , the joys of trying to make a good movie ! So much can go wrong that it makes farming seem like a safe bet . Home Fries has all the elements needed to make a great entertainment , save one . It 's badly miscast . As I watched its comically bizarre story unfold , I found myself recasting it.Being miscast and being a bad actor is not the same thing at all . Everyone in this movie has proved themselves to be good in a number of other projects . They simply are not adapt at the maniacal kind of performing that this movie requires . It 's in the same genre as There 's Something About Mary , in that a serious subject is not to be taken seriously at all . These are what are often called screwball comedies.Drew Barrymore is Sally , who is mine momhs pregnant She works in a fast food restaurant . Her lover lied to her by claiming was not married . To further complicate matters , Mrs . Lever is lethally jealous . She convinces her son Dorian [ Luke Wuksin ] and her stepson Angus [ Jake Busey ] to scare the devil out of the old man by chasing him down a county road in a helicopter . Unfortunately , this gives Dad a fatal heaty attack.The rest if the movie has to do with Angus ' trying to save Sally from his totally mad famly.The story is madcap , and the dialog is crisp . Both the photography and the editing are sharp . So we return to the casting problems.Parker Posey would have been ideal as Sally . Kathleen Tuner would have been great as Mrs . Lever . Cast Brad Pitt as the psycho brother , and Keanu Reeves as Angus , and you would have had a gem of a movie .	-1
based on earlier reviews I watched the movie but for some reason it bored me . Maybe its the kind of film that needs an audience .	-1
Sorry -- I 'm not buying it . I do n't mean the video ( although that 's true , also ) -- I mean all the apologists here who are defending the & quot ; misunderstood & quot ; film against myopic critics and uninformed ticketbuyers . I do n't buy the arguments.Yes , of course , Billy Jack himself is no pacifist . Of course it 's incorrect to say that he preached love and peace while practicing violence.But Billy Jack the character and & quot ; Billy Jack & quot ; the movie are two different things. & quot ; Billy Jack 's & quot ; message , ultimately , is that peace is worth compromising for . But the trouble is , the movie does exactly that with all its violence . And not in the name of peace , but in the name of profit.Nobody I have ever talked with about this movie has commented on the force of its & quot ; message & quot ; or Delores Taylor 's performance or even the stop-the-plot-dead-in-its-tracks antics of The Committee . People talk about the action sequences . & quot ; Billy Jack & quot ; is an action-adventure , and a very shrewd one , because between it and the earlier & quot ; Born Losers , & quot ; Tom Laughlin evidently figured out that in an age of peace and love , a ... Western needs a bit of flower power to draw the masses . And that 's what he added to the second movie . That 's the big difference ( and the reason for the difference in box office ) .If you think I 'm wrong , take this simple test . Ask yourself which movie made more money : & quot ; Billy Jack , & quot ; which contained violent action with a message of peace and love , or & quot ; The Trial of Billy Jack , & quot ; the next sequel , which shifted its emphasis almost entirely to the message alone . Which was the absolute bomb ? I wonder why .	-1
I was twelve years old when I saw this on the big screen and loved every minute of it . Today I feel a trickle of cold sweat whenever the movie is mentioned.It is n't so much that BILLY JACK is a bad movie as it is an awesomely pretentious one rife with hypocrisy . The story of non-violent native Americans and flower children saved from hysterical cowboys by Billy Jack ( who wants to be non-violent but always has to kick butt ) is well-intentioned , but from a modern standpoint it is more than just a little embarassing . The production values are so-so , and the cast is merely adequate at best . If you have fond memories of this film , keep them by leaving BILLY JACK in the past : do n't see it again . And if you have never seen it ... leave well enough alone .	-1
Like many children of the 70 's , I was fascinated by this yarn in the day . I saw it several times and dutifully saw `` Born Losers '' ( a exploitation re-release that features Billy Jack 's character , and a far better film ) as well as `` The Trial of Billy Jack '' ( the third installment and even worse than this outing ) . Years later , it 's enlightening to realize what we have outgrown from our youth . The acting , directing and production is pretty awful , but forgivable . The ideology spouted in this stinker is a fast food bastardization of the worst `` hold hands and sing together '' hippie trash.Tom Laughlin plays the title role of former Green Beret and reclusive `` half-breed '' ( their words ) protector of a southwestern `` Freedom School '' where love interest/head schoolmarm Jean ( Delores Taylor ) and her doltish charges harbor runaways , perform dreadful improv and guerilla theatre and generally get under the skin of redneck cowboy law enforcement in their town.When Jean protects the runaway daughter of local lawman , tension come to a head and Billy Jack must step away from the pacifism he and Jean cherish and lay gratuitous Kung Fu beatdowns on local bullies.For martial arts fans , the payoff are far and few , if you enjoy rape scenes ( and I sure hope you do NOT ! ) there are a couple of man-with-knife-doing-bad-things-to-women scenes that appear as salacious panders to this element.If watching the Freedom School kids travel around like a Marxist Partidge Family in their stupid hippie bus does n't make you dread Flower Child nostalgia , you will surely be disgusted by the use of violence to market non-violence , the lecturing moral high ground tone of the films message and the all around insipid style of this useless atrifact . ( NOTE* all martial arts in the film are performed by Laughlins stand-in , the great Master Bong Soo Han , and if you look closely you 'll notice a distinct physical disimilarity between Laughlin and the man doing great roundhouse kicks )	-1
Amateurish hippie crap . The only good things about the movie are scenery and the ... and the uh ... .hmmmm ... .let me think for a while . Of course one side had to be totally good and one side totally evil . And we ca n't have Tom Laughlin 's wife 's freedom school losers be the evil ones can we ? This movie is basically a repetition of every hippie myth propagated by the left during the sixties and seventies about all those wonderful losers er dreamers who wanted to sit around do drugs and sing awful neo-folk songs and the ( gasp , shudder ) the establishment ( boo , hiss ) who only want to shoot things like horses and puppies and kittens while acting like violent racists towards everybody who is n't a member of the Elks . A really awful movie . But I love the western scenery , so I 'll bump it up to two stars .	-1
Sometimes a movie is so bad that it 's unintentionally funny . However , that does n't seem to work with `` Billy Jack '' because so many people seem take it seriously . I know . I saw it when it came out and I remember many people I knew who thought it was a fantastic movie . I have forgiven them and have moved on with my life . Still , the movie comes to mind from time to time as an example of leftist hypocrisy.The main problem I have with the movie is its ' stereo-typic generalities . I realize that this could be a condemnation of 95 % of movies ever made but , in this particular case , I figured that the creators would rise above it . Yet here we have a rural Southwestern town of moderate size with all the `` bad guys '' of the 60 's and early 70 's . We have the rich man who runs everything , the law enforcement officer who seems to take more orders from the rich man than from his own superior , the redneck rowdies who attack hippies on signal , the spoiled rich kid who could have been `` real '' but failed to take the right turn , the yes men who all kiss up to the rich man , etc . etc . etc . Then we have the good guys at the `` school '' . This motley crew of misfits is really too much to believe . They are `` students '' at this school where the only thing that seems to be taught is creativity . Creativity is nice but not as a sole source of learning . Anyhow these hippies seem to always get beat up , harassed or humiliated whenever they go into town . That 's where Billy Jack comes in . The kids never stand up for themselves and , frankly , the way the characters are laid out , they 'd probably only get beaten up worse if they did . But Billy Jack , a `` half-breed '' former Viet Nam veteran generally comes to the rescue and kicks some major butt . He 's sweet on the `` school '' director and she is sweet on him . Lots of things happen during the movie . They are designed to make us hate the `` establishment '' and love the hippies . For example , the movie opens with the bad rich rancher and his followers rounding up wild horses into a corral . They all are ready to shoot these penned-in animals until Billy Jack makes his first appearance and faces down all of these armed men . The horses are freed and the rednecks are mad and it just gets worse from that point on . The rich man 's son rapes the `` school '' director ( I hope I 'm not giving too much away here ) and the force of good ( Billy Jack ) meets the forces of evil ( just about everybody else not associated with the school ) . Guess who wins.The main objection that I have with this movie is that is disguises violence in a pacifist coating . The same people who would ridicule John Wayne movies as pointless violence seemed to regale the karate beatings delivered by Billy Jack . He was fighting FOR us so whatever he did was OK . I heard plenty of that from my fellow college students at the time the movie came out . The stereo-typing of really bad versus really innocent bothered me as well . We have few people who fit into any sort of middle ground . There 's the Sherrif and a few townspeople and that 's about it . The `` students '' seem to be orphans who were abused by society or their own families and have found a haven ( read heaven ) at this `` school '' . This whole `` school '' concept is a make-believe extremity of some of the farther-out thought processes at work in those days . Viewed today , I assume that the concept becomes more laughable than it was 30 years ago . Finally , it seems that the whole concept was a self-created `` star vehicle '' for the creators of the movie . That 's not the only time such things have happened ( try watching `` Good Will Hunting '' ) . However , the whole scope of the work of Tom Mclaughlin and his wife seem to all center around this one character . I 've never seen any of his other movies . I do n't have to ; the titles tell me what I already suspected . If I were to have to come up with one good thing to say about the movie ( and if I were a student at the `` school '' , I 'm sure that could be my assignment ) , it would be the very good work of a comedy troupe whose professional name escapes me . You 'll recognize Howard Hessman as a part of that group in one of his earliest roles.Well , thanks for listening . After all these years it feels good to get this off my chest .	-1
This film is exactly like its original only this time the mob is after them . And also instead of Michael Hui , Jackie 's capilot is Richard Kiel ( the giant who played `` Jaws '' in 2 James Bond Movies : `` The Spy Who Loved Me '' and `` Moonraker '' ) . But then again it 's quality is very poor ... if you want to buy it do n't waste your money on the expensive DVD edition , buy it on the cheap VHS edition . Jackie Chan still appears in a few cameo appereances but this time a few more .	-1
I enjoyed the original Cannonball Run , but this film should never had been made . It should have been torpedoed in the planning stages . There was very little that was enjoyable about this bomb . I enjoyed the Tim Conway and Don Knotts cameos , but that 's about it . Even the angry ape was n't funny especially after the news of the ape that horribly attacked that woman a few years ago . Take my advice and skip it .	-1
Justly forgotten , `` Cannonball Run II '' ( 1984 ) is a glorified home movie that displays its all-star cast in a spectacularly poor light . Production values are nonexistent and the anticipated Rat Pack reunion ( with Frank Sinatra barely showing up ) falls woefully flat . After sinking to the depths of `` Stroker Ace , '' Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham end their screen partnership on a wretched note . Sad to say , Dean Martin 's last film appearance .	-1
The movie starts off nicely but ends up to be ridiculous and unconvincing . The actors are basically wasted . The only good thing about this film is James Newton Howard 's fine score .	-1
I ca n't imagine anyone being able to adapt `` The Power of One '' into a film . The book has too many important characters and events for a single film to cover the material without feeling rushed.That said , this movie misses the mark so badly that if I had seen it prior to reading the book I would never have read the book .	-1
Why did they produce such a cheap transfer ? There is some artifacting , the blacks are not solid , there 's lots of edge enhancement , but most of all , it 's full frame !	-1
Far from the best Angelica Houston movie I 've been able to see , however it is written for kids . My seven-year-old refused to go to the restroom for a few days after seeing it . Whether you 're searching for funny or scary , I 'd keep looking .	-1
I saw the movie yeas ago when it came out . Somewhat entertaining but pretty much invents a lot of Roy Bean 's adventures . Bean did have a number of adventures and led a full life , but was basically was a decent guy who in later life helped his community and lived by the rules of his time . He actually only sentenced two men to hang but one escaped . So the hanging judge is not accurate . I think his real life was more interesting than the movie .	-1
Robert Altman once again demonstrates his inability to comprehend the essence of his film 's subject . The dismal story of this would-be-Western is only matched by the dismal photography by Vilmos Zsigmond . This film helped destroy the iconic myth of the American West . I do not like this movie at all .	-1
While I thought the story itself and the cinematography was good , I was totally unimpresed with the dialog given by Altman to Beatty and Christie . Beatty basically has mumble dialog and Christie business dialog . I never really could get involved with the characters . I also thought Cohen 's 1971 sounding music was annoyingly out of place for this early century movie . I think this is the clear failing of the director and wonder how much better this movie could have been had someone other than Altman ( Huston , perhaps ? ) directed & controlled the screenplay/movie .	-1
I have to remember NEVER to go back and watch , as an adult , those movies I loved when I was a kid.First , let 's say a few positive things : It 's got a cute gopher ( who is hardly in the movie ) , a great Rodney Dangerfield ( likewise wasted , except for his wonderous opening scene ) , an almost funny Bill Murray ( at least he 's trying ) , and a catchy-as-heck Kenny Loggins song.All else is abominable . Ted Knight , a great and undervalued comedian , is left painfully stranded ( after this , `` Too Close for Comfort '' was a major step up ) . The whole , poorly acted , half baked ( and unresolved ) teenager subplot makes MEATBALLS seem profound by comparison . It even fails as a sex comedy . And do we really need a seduction scene with Chevy chase and massage oil ? How masochistic did the producers think their audience was in 1980 ? As for the the ludicrous , accompanying dvd `` documentary '' : is it just me , or are Harold Ramis and Chevy Chase competing for the most self-satisfied , smug position in Hollywood ?	-1
I dont care what anyone says , Im sick to death of much older men with very young girls . Yuck . He seemed ridiculous to me , the aging Romeo . After the appeal from her own father-he just had to rob the cradle anyway.I can think of scores of better actors than Cooper for that role . The orchestra following him everywhere was funny ; but not enough of make this age difference palatable to me . There must be 30 years between them !	-1
Viewed : 12/10Rate : 412/10 : After seeing Murder in Three Acts , I was eager for more from Peter Ustinov and went ahead with Thirteen at Dinner . Needless to say , I was disappointed with the film . I was hoping for a great one because Faye Dunaway starred in the film as well . As a matter of fact , I do n't feel it was either 's fault that the film fared out poorly . It was rather the following of the story that had me hopelessly lost . The director failed to have me engaged , so the plot became more and more faraway , thus leaving me uninterested to the end . In a way , the ending was pretty typical of any murder mystery film : sum up the facts and produce the killer . That 's exactly what Peter Ustinov did as Hercule Poirot . Comparing Thirteen at Dinner to Murder in Three Acts , the latter was simply more interesting , had better cinematography and better lines , and was more engaging and easier to follow . All in all , I am only giving the film a ` 4 ' because of Peter Ustinov and Faye Dunaway ; they were excellent as usual . Meanwhile , I just have to point out a stupid error in the film : the killer happened to use the glasses of another person for impersonation , but it 's impossible that prescribed glasses will suit the killer 's eyes so perfectly well as it does on the other person . Common sense will say that the killer will only wear it when necessary .	-1
Peter Ustinov returns for the third time as Belguim Detective , Hercule Poirot , since his portrail in DEATH ON THE NILE ( 1978 ) and EVIL UNDER THE SUN ( 1982 ) . Thirteen At Dinner is a 1985 tv-movie . The cast includes Faye Dunaway and Lee Horsley ( Matt Houston tv series ) . Poirot is interviewed by talk show host David Frost , who has just interviewed Lee Horsley as & quot ; Brian & quot ; . A surprise on the talk show is Horsley 's co-star Jane Wilkenson ( played by Faye Dunaway ) . But after a few dramatic lines , we find out it is an impersonator . The real Jane Wilkenson ( also played by Faye Dunaway ) is at home watching this live on television . She invites them to her house for dinner , including the impersonator . The real Jane Wilkenson is also known as Lady Edgeway by marriage . She wants a divorce from her husband . later that night , Horsley confides to Poirot a strange woman has been following him . The next morning , we find out that Lady Edgeway 's husband has been murdered last night . On the movie set , we se Lee Horsley in his & quot ; Matt Houston & quot ; role ( listen for the in-joke ) . Horsley thinks Lady Edgeway did it and , of course , must be replaced on the movie.Folks , if you do not have this one figured out in less than 10 minutes , you were into your ice cream . Okay , I 'll give you 24 minutes . If you are too good , you have been watching & quot ; Columbo & quot ; .Followed by , with Peter ustinov as & quot ; Poirot & quot ; : Dead man 's Folly ( 1986-tv ) , Murder in Three Acts ( 1986-tv ) , Appointment With Death ( 1988 ) .	-1
With an exceptional cast Like Dustin Hoffman , Vannesa Redgrave , Timothy Dalton you would think see a fine film , not so in this case . Hoffman plays a swarmy news reporter ( with a slick hairdo that makes him look like Alpaha from the Rascals ) who investgates the mystreoius 11 day dissaperence of famed author Agatha Christie . The producers had a good story but loused it up with boring melodrama and phony background music that will either make people laugh or fall asleep . Michael Apted was notin full swing here , but did a better job directing Sissy ` s Spacek in COAL MINER ` S DAUGHTER As for AGATHA this film lacks oringality and any decent performances	-1
`` A Perfect Murder '' , inspired by the great Alfred Hitchcock 's `` Dial M for Murder '' , boasts a first-rate cast and not much else . Directed by Andrew Davis ( `` The Fugitive '' , `` Collateral Damage '' , `` Holes '' ) , based on the `` Dial M for Murder '' script by Frederick Knott , written by Patrick Smith Kelly ( `` Do n't Say a Word '' ) , and starring Michael Douglas , Gwyneth Paltrow , and Viggo Mortensen , one just has to wonder how such talented people could churn out such a mess of a film.I had no empathy for any of the characters in this film . I felt very detached from all the characters in this film and thus did n't really care what happened to any of them . This eventually leads to boredom , as it did in my case.Boredom : another thing that plagues this film . In a desperate attempt to make things more interesting , the writer throws in a bunch of twists and turns that failed to shock or interest me in the least . Frankly , this film got downright tedious . During some of the more `` suspenseful '' sequences , I often found myself checking my watch . No good.The sole redeeming factor of this film is the trio of A-list actors we get to watch . Michael Douglas is pitch-perfect as a scheming , greedy businessman . The eternally elegant and ethereal Gwyneth Paltrow is mesmerizing to watch and brings a little bit of light into this otherwise dark film . And then we have VIGGO ( Mortensen , that is ) . Incase you 've been living under a rock for the past few years ; we all know and love Mortensen as Aragorn in `` The Lord of the Rings '' trilogy . Though Viggo had been in many films prior , this is probably the biggest role he 'd ever had in a mainstream film at the time . It 's fascinating to watch the man who , in probably only a few months , would be on his way to New Zealand for the role of his career .	-1
What a propaganda job . The imagery at the start makes the murderer ( Kevin Bacon ) look like Jesus in The Passion of the Christ . The film claims to be based on the true story of Henry Young , but claims he was an innocent prisoner tortured in a dungeon in Alcatraz . It turns out none of that 's true , the real Henry Young was in fact previously convicted of murder , and was never confined in a dungeon as the film depicts [ ... ] . The movie , having stated it 's based on a true story , leaves gullible audiences with indelible yet totally false impressions of the American penal and justice systems . As science fiction , it 's great ; good acting , well contrived story .	-1
This & quot ; thing & quot ; should n't even had been called a & quot ; movie & quot ; , so bad it is ! MAybe if you watch it as a comedy about action movies , you 'll enjoy it a little bit .	-1
... and no one will get hurt.How anyone gives Ken Russell the money to make a film is beyond me . I guess stranger things do happen in the world of film beyond Hollywood . Altered States is silly , dumb tat masquerading as metaphysical cinematic art . `` Lair of the White Worm '' at least had more entertaining camp .	-1
This movie was boring as all get out ! ! ! ! The Muppets Show have better special effects ! William hurt should be forced to watch this film over and over again until he wets himself and promises never to do it again ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The synopsis on the jacket was promising : & quot ; Research Scientist Eddie Jessup ( William Hurt ) believes other states of consciousness are as real as everyday reality . Using sensory deprivation , then adding powerful , hallucinogenic drugs , he explores these altered states & quot ; This is a subject that intrigues me , so I really looked forward to viewing this film . I was disappointed . It is evident that the writer did no or little research on the topic . Professor Jessup takes a mushroom used by a mexican tribe ( presumably based on the tribes that Robert Wasson investigated in the late 50s whose ceremony centers around eating a psilocybin mushroom ) . None of this is realistic ... he goes on a fantastic trip and completely loses consciousness of everday reality ( which is not how it happens ) ... he drinks the mushroom from a brew ( looks like they got mushroom use mixed up with ayahuasca ... there were the cosmic serpents to boot ! ) , he kills a lizard and does not remember it.He also experiments with sensory deprivation using the John Lily floatation tanks ... However , he can speak to the lab assistants outside the tank ... which does not make it & quot ; sensory deprivation & quot ; does it ? During one of the hallucinatory experiences , he discovers that he can exteriorize the & quot ; trip & quot ; and he starts to have some kind of morpho-genetic changes ... .namely he becomes some kind of early hominid , escapes from the lab and finally ends up in a zoo , where he kills and eats one of the zoo 's sheep . He eventually changes back to his normal state.On another trip , he regresses to the cellular level and then goes on further to become the Big Bang.I dont know if the director Ken Russel intended it that way , but this movie is as full of misinformation about the psychedelic experience as & quot ; Reefer Madness & quot ; was about marijuana . It is equally misinformed about Floatation Tanks.While I found this film to be ridiculous , poorly researched and a candidate for Drug War Film of the Year , it could be fine comical relief for a group in a college dormitory looking for a good laugh.Thomas Seay	-1
i have to say i had high hopes for this flick . was i totally let down . while i liked the wolves killing people , i did not like how they added a indian type of theme to it . not my cup of tea . if you like werewolf movies and thinking that what you are going to get out of this one , do n't buy it .	-1
Finally released on DVD ; I guess to cash in on the new Poseidon movie . Producer Irwin Allen returns to the scene of his greatest triumph . Released in 1979 , seven years after The Poseidon Adventure broke all box office records and started the entire 'disaster movie ' genre.Beyond The Poseidon Adventure could have been so much better , ( not that it is ALL bad ) but with a better script ( possibly looking at some of the other survivors and their attempts to escape , and a rescue attempt ) it would have been an excellent sequel.However , here Allen resorts to all the old cliche 's : looting , guns , ammunitions , shooting , pilfering and something about 'plutonium ' all this on a sinking upside down 81 000 ton ocean liner ... please . It certainly has a good cast Sally Field , Michael Caine , Karl Malden , Shirley Knight ( wasted ) and some new up and coming actors at the time ; beautiful Veronica Hamel and fresh faced Mark Harmon but they are all given thankless roles . There are one or two gripping scenes , but the whole story and plotline involving Telly Savalas and his looting of the Liner and resulting shootouts etc are tedious to say the least . The sets are well done , and it does pay homage to the original by including a scene or two ( see if you can spot them ) but the lighting is a bit bright for ship on emergency generators , and surpisingly the ocean around the over turned liner is pristine ... no wreckage , oil , bodies , nothing.It 's for the disaster movie completist ( and I am one ) and fans of Master Disaster Irwin Allen . I guess its time to put 'When Time Ran Out ' on dvd too .	-1
I grew up watching these all star disaster movies and even if this one is bottom of the barrel , it 's fun to watch . If you want something that makes sense look someplace else , but if very bad disaster movies are your thing then kick back and enjoy .	-1
This movie was horrible compared to the original & # 34 ; The Poseidon Adventure & # 34 ; why does Hollywood keep remaking oldclassic movies . This version was horrible ... .	-1
I remember the first time I saw this uneven and mostly unfunny sequel to the classic original . I felt violated and wanted redemption for the injustice that was bestrode upon me ! I must admit that I have mellowed over the years on this movie and I feel it does have a few moments . Randy Quaid is by far the best thing in this movie and his negotiation scene about the ( The Peter Blunt System ) zoning laws is hysterical . Jackie Mason is no Dangerfield , but he does have a few moments . This is not essential viewing by any means , but if you have seen the original as many times as I have , you may be able to find some redeeming moments in this luke warm sequel .	-1
Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield were smart to stayaway from this flick and Ted Knight smartest of all ! Judge Smails croaked before it even began filming.Cheap Trick fans may want to get the Beattles coversong from it .	-1
Caddyshack will probably forever be one of the greatest golf comedies of all time . Caddyshack II will be known as the WORST golf movie of all time .	-1
Disappointing adaptation of Lawrence Sanders ' breakthrough bestseller squashes the story down to an under-two-hour format , leaching out the characterizations and offering only a few bare facts . The result is a flat , tepid thriller without much suspense.In his final dramatic film role , Sinatra shows why he was so highly regarded as a screen performer . Despite a poor script and limp direction , his charisma is sufficient to make this watchable . He conveys genuine emotion and makes it possible for us to empathize with an underwritten character.Faye Dunaway , unfortunately , is limited to a few scenes , all of which take place in a hospital bed , as she plays Sinatra 's dying wife . In the novel , Mrs. Delaney 's scenes served as a poignant counterpoint to his search for the killer . He discusses the case with her , sharing all the details , and Sanders paints a powerful portrait of a cop who defeats the killer , but it powerless against the disease that is killing his wife . In the movie this does not come off at all , and viewers not familiar with the book may wonder why these scenes were included.The DVD is a bare bones , full-screen transfer , with no extras.Sinatra fans may enjoy this film , but I 'd recommend reading Sanders ' novel instead if you 're looking for a gripping hunt-for-the-killer mystery .	-1
The acting is fine and the direction competent . But the script is extremely weak . Oh , Nora , you failed us again . There are very , very few laughs .	-1
I guess I 'll be the only one here with a bad review of this Hitchcock movie.Though we have a very original story here , I was amazed at feeling that the actors were saying their lines at the camera , not at the opposite actor . And flatly at that ! Never have I seen it show as much ( and I have seen a lot of movies ! ! ! ) . Nobody seemed convinced of what they were doing . We all know that Dietrich is not the best actress in the world ( more an extraordinary personality ) but here , she is cold as ever . Wyman is better ... and Sims is the treasure of the lot , with much life to his character.However , at the risk of looking a bit out of order , I still encourage you to see it . I am not a Hitchcock fan , but I believe we learn to appreciate by viewing many different movies ...	-1
This adaptation of Tom Wolfe 's controversial bestseller joined the ranks of infamously bad movies ( many of which seem to feaure Bruce Willis ) within its first week of release ; it died a dog 's death in theaters and shuffled morosely to video four months later ( which , at the time , was a pretty fast turnover ; these days it 's much more common ) . As the director who got handed this vast steaming pile of a script , Brian De Palma does everything in his considerable power to keep himself and us amused , and you 're grateful for his efforts . But it does n't amount to much . Even the opening tracking shot works against the movie ; it 's there for its sheer De Palma-ness , and it steals the movie 's thunder.The leads were picked not because of their rightness for the roles but because of star power . This is n't a movie , it 's a package . It might seem insane to cast Tom Hanks as Sherman McCoy , the arrogant trader who accidentally runs over a black kid and sparks a media war , but Hanks is n't actually all that bad . But Melanie Griffith ( with her now-you-hear-it , now-you-do n't Southern accent ) and Bruce Willis ( playing an alcoholic journalist who was British in the novel ) are very much all that bad . De Palma 's idea of avoiding charges of racism is to turn everyone into a cartoon regardless of race . Towards the end , when the judge played by Morgan Freeman makes his big , insufferable brotherhood speech , De Palma just seems to give up in disgust ; he points the camera at Freeman and lets him drone on and on.As was brilliantly reported in Julie Salomon 's book & quot ; The Devil 's Candy , & quot ; the movie might as well have been pronounced dead the moment Michael Cristofer was hired to perpetrate the screenplay . Fortunately , most of the people involved went on to better things , so that nobody really holds this movie against them anymore ; released in late 1990 , it has come to be seen as the last gasp of shallow '80s commentary on shallow '80s values . For a sharper look , rent & quot ; American Psycho & quot ; ( a reverse case where the movie was better than the book ) .	-1
this movie is pretty dull and a good example of a bad film adaptation of a kind of okay book . sometimes it 's laughable when it 's not supposed to be , hahaha ! ! i laughed .	-1
Contains full frontal female nudity . Meg Tilly used a body double.This is the third film of its kind , beginning with Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1956 ) starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter.Remade in 1978 as `` Invasion of the Body Snatchers '' ( 1978 ) with with an all-star cast : Donald Sutherland , Brooke Adams , Veronica Cartwright , Leonard Nimoy and Jeff Goldblum . Kevin McCarthy returned as a frantic man in the street.This 1993 remake , `` Body Snatchers '' ( 1993 ) is not thrilling nor suspenseful as the brilliant 1978 version , but Meg Tilly does give a memorable performance.The Malone family is on the road to their new house on the Army base . They stop at a backroad gas station so Marti ( Gabrielle Anwar ) can use the bathroom . As she enters the one-light bulb facility , a hiding black soldier ( Kevin Smith ) nearly assaults Marti , but only wants to warn her , `` They get you when you sleep '' . She tells her family , but upon inspection , the man has disappeared.At the base , her father , Dr. Steve Malone ( Terry Kinney ) is told as he is taking toxic samples from what use to be a river , is warned by Major Collins ( Forest Whitaker ) that people here are afraid to sleep ... afraid of their families ... afraid of themselves . Marti 's brother , Andy ( Reilly Murphy ) is found by a nice soldier Tim ( Billy Wirth ) . Andy was running away from the `` bad people '' in daycare.The mother , Carol ( Meg Tilly ) becomes the first victim of the `` Body Snatchers '' .Also in the cast : R. Lee Ermey and Kathleen Doyle.Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1956 ) Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1978 ) Body Snatchers ( 1993 ) THE INVASION ( 2007 ) starring Daniel Craig , Nicole Kidman , Jeffery Wright , Veronica Cartwright , Jeremy Northam was released August 17 , 2007 .	-1
I adore this movie and have since my teens , and had been waiting for at least 10 years for it to come out on DVDBut now I have a copy it will not play . Tried our DVD player , my boyfriend 's Xbox and even my PC , no diceReading some of the other reviews this appears to be a common problem . Buyer beware !	-1
Just straight up bad writing , bad acting . When is someone going to realize you cant beat the one and only original . This was another pathetic attempt to mine scares from the vastly superior original . This effort just comes of as another pale imitation .	-1
Although this third sequel had a few return characters , unlike the second sequel , it was as confusing as number 2.Even George C. Scott could n't save this film.There was no ending , no closure.I would n't buy it or even accept it as a gift.Stick with The Exorcist original and leave it at that .	-1
... You watch it and find yourself sucked into an otherwise story by numbers movie ( hey , the old guy says `` no sunlight , water or food after midnight '' so you 're warned what to expect already ) . Main criticism of course is its lack of focus on the hilarious antics of the evil Gremlins ( something the sequel did a little better ) who destroy a good portion of a town , but are n't seen nearly enough to make you detest them - instead they 're little more than pests . The level of gore is surprising , which is how you can tell that this is n't technically a `` kids '' movie , so care should be taken with young children ( but saying that I 'd have been 7 when I saw this and had no problem ... .but then Nightmare on Elm Street might have desensitised me a bit by that time ) but it 's essential viewing if only so that you can watch the sequel too .	-1
This movie really was not my cup of tea at all . Could n't follow it and was kinda of boring . I usually like the me movies he play in but this was a no go..for me .	-1
Now , this should have been a great film about the ( seemingly ) futility of the White mans rage in a increasingly non-White society and how this frustration can be unleashed in fits of brutality , both domestic and sociopathic . But the movie NEVER displays any faith in this conviction . Its primary offense in this regard is making Douglas ' character less of a typical White man than he is a typical psycho . It 's not just the bad haircut and pocket protector ; we eventually learn that Douglas was a man who would get extremely upset if anything did not happen precisely as he wanted it to , who had been fired from his job a month ago , and who still left his mother every morning pretending to leave for a job which he no longer held . If Douglas had played a more normal person , than his acts of rage might have been more challenging ( and understandable ) . And after the ridiculous scene with the Nazi-survivalist surplus store owner , you realize that the script has lost it totally , and the rest of the movie simply winds down into the generic and typical social statement that we 've all seen and hated before.A weak and total cop-out of a film - Forget it .	-1
I have a daughter , too - like the protagonist in this film.She 's studying English composition in high school , and I was helping her study . There was a list of composition terms , like `` exposition '' and `` suspense '' and `` resolution . `` One was `` Sentimentality . '' It made me think of this movie . The writers were trying to place the audience in sympathy with Bill Foster , and did so by creating circumstances around him that middle class white people have heard about or experienced.The warped edge of sentimentality is that , once you 're hooked by it , you can be manipulated by it . So , interest in dramatic quality gets sidetracked by our own visceral need for resolution . We can set aside our moral objections and hope that Bill just kills somebody.Of course , that 's exactly how the makers of the movie reel us in . Gradually we are manipulated into shifting our identification from Bill to Robert Duvall.What makes this a weak movie , though , is that good movies do n't manipulate audiences with sentimentality . Audience identification is welcome and maybe even essential , but who likes to feel outsmarted or manipulated ? When it was first relased , the film succeeded commercially by capitalizing on the sensationalism of its main theme . Now , so many years later , we see how the end result leaves you cold .	-1
Not a very good movie . I know the story , it is the cinema version that I do n't like.Bad direction .	-1
NOT MY CUP OF TEA . VERY MORBIT PLOT THAT WAS DEPRESSING . COULD NOT GET INTO THIS FILM . MUCH TO MORBIT .	-1
It astounds me every time I see a movie based on a classic and very popular book that completely changes the storyline and characters and makes it into nothing more then a cheap imitation . The Omega Man is one such film . Based on a book of great influence by Richard Matheson , I Am Legend , the only true similarity between the book and this film is the fact that the ghouls , or `` the family , '' can only come out at night ; after that the similarities end.The film starts out with our hero , Neville , driving down the streets of an abandoned city in his bright red convertible , dodging stalled cars and overturned trashcans . The empty are very early and manage to set up the apocalyptic feel very early on . For the time it was made the abandoned street scenes during the day were actually quite good . The problems with this film start once night falls and Neville is caught outside in the dark as the `` zombies '' started to come out . he gets into a few fire fights with the ghouls , and then goes inside as if staying out after dark were n't such a big deal.the biggest disappointment I found with this extremely silly film were the ghouls themselves , if you can call them that . In the book they were real vampires who sucked blood , were repelled by garlic and crosses , burned to death almost instantly in sunlight , and needed to be killed with a stake as opposed to a gun . The vampires in this film have absolutely no vampire qualities , except the hatred for sunlight . Think of them like the borg from Star Trek who share a common mind , live as a family , and like to go around killing people . These vampires are the silliest movie monsters I have ever seen in my life . They where black robes and sunglasses , play with fire , and ( I kid you not ) build catapults and fire rocks at Neville 's house . They are n't mindless blood thirsty vampire creatures like in the book , their just a bunch of emo goths who do n't like technology . sunlight does n't even do them much harm ; in many instances you could see them walking around in bright light with only a slight sensitivity.This film does just about everything badly , from the script , to the annoying music , to the horrendous acting , nothing goes right . The characters actions will have you scratching your head in confusion and asking `` okay , now , why did they just to that ? '' and no answer will come to mind . This is one of the most incomprehensible and flat out silly films I have ever seen in my entire life . I 'm not a fan of the new filmI Am Legend ( Widescreen Single-Disc Edition ) with Will Smith , but given the choice I 'd take it any day over The Omega Man .	-1
The Omega Man is not a very good film , but there are scenes of great power , as well scenes of great cheesiness . Chuck Heston , in slightly toned-down & quot ; Planet of the Apes & quot ; form , is humankind 's savior yet , as usual with Chuck 's film alter-egos , the viewer 's reaction to him is , at best , ambivalent . Nevill has been part and parcel of the destruction of the human race , is arrogant and reactionary , yet he is also a redeemer and a man of accelerating conscience . The movie revolves around his bleak , yet self-imposed state of existence . Nevill 's mercenary clashes with his decrepit enemies , much of the dialogue , Nevill 's relationship with Lisa ( a neat pairing ) , and the classic Christ-like final scene are interesting and speak to larger moral and social issues eloquently ( if a bit hammily , at times ) , but the film fails to capture the viewer . There are a number of dramatic lapses in the movie , the editing is poor , and the & quot ; zombie & quot ; enemy is a hackneyed , and , in the end , silly antagonist . The movie also has the same dingy , low-energy atmosphere that characterized & quot ; Soylent Green & quot ; . This atmosphere helps the film at times , yet also stamps the movie irreversibly as a product of the early 1970s ' ambitious yet generally unsuccessful & quot ; pessimistic future & quot ; genre of films . Finally , the score is truly horrendous . It is funny for a while , but then begins to really get on the viewer 's nerves , and it does nothing to help in already dull , poorly directed scenes . In short , the movie is dated and directed with minimal energy and skill , but it is worth a look if you want to see a period piece of a jaded time in the & quot ; sci-fi & quot ; genre , a fun Chuck Heston performance , and flawed ambition .	-1
Scientist Robert Neville ( Charlton Heston ) is the last man on earth after a reaction from a vaccine left the world 's population dead . A few survivors have mutated into a group called `` The Family . '' These people despise the last living man of the human race and blame him for the massive outbreak which left them unable to function in sunlight.This film is absolutely silly with very little resemblance to the modern remake I am Legend . Here Neville tools around in random convertibles he finds along the roads of the city by day , weilding an automatic rifle at all times . He likes to shoot , but not really at anything in particular . He also enjoys walking around shirtless and berating inanimate objects . The concept of `` The Family '' is frightening in theory , but in application , the group resembles a cult of Jawas from Star Wars . The death scenes in the beginning are far from chilling . In fact , the twisted looks on the faces of the dead and dying humans are laughable and ridiculous.Fans of I am Legend might find themselves interested in this film to compare the two , but there really is no comparison . The remake is action packed , thought provoking , and emotional . The Omega Man should be taken as seriously as an episode of Walker Texas Ranger .	-1
There was something about Charlton Heston that made him perfect for the role of Taylor in `` Planet Of The Apes ( 1968 ) '' ( 1968 ) and `` Beneath The Planet Of The Apes '' ( 1970 ) , two of the greatest sci-fi/adventure flicks of all time . So it 's no wonder that the producers of 1971 's `` Omega Man '' chose Heston for what is essentially the same role in this film about the supposedly last man on earth living in L.A. after a war waged with biological weapons , loosely based on a book by Richard Matheson . Unfortunately the third time 's definitely not the charm and the film holds little interest beyond an early 70s period piece or nostalgia.I remember catching `` Omega Man '' sometime in the 90s and expecting a great early 70s sci-fi flick with a great protagonist and all I remember was being extremely disappointed and ( I think ) not even finishing the flick . Well , I decided to give it another chance last night , fully braced for an underwhelming experience , and my original impressions were pretty accurate.The film starts off well with Taylor , I mean Neville ( Heston , ) wandering around a deserted Los Angeles , muttering to himself , watching `` Woodstock '' for the 100th time , etc . but the horribly dated 'hip ' score is the first bad sign and then night comes down and these cloaked albino vampire-zombies appear , which is what turned me off the first time I caught the film . Just listen to their dialogue . I wanted to run away in horror , and not in the good way.But , from there , I hoped , that the film would settle into its own groove , as long as I overlooked the bad music and corny villains or just accepted them as a part of this period oddity . `` Omega Man '' does settle into a groove , it 's just that it 's not all that engrossing . And what 's up with Heston taking off his shirt every 8 minutes ? The flashbacks to how this apocalyptic scenario originated were interesting , as well as Neville 's run-ins with others , but the film never rises above the mediocre and heavily dated.One might argue that `` dated '' is an unjust criticism given the film 's age , but all good or great films are able to transcend their eras even while clearly being from their eras , like `` Lawrence of Arabia , '' `` Ben-Hur , '' `` King Kong , '' `` Jaws ( Widescreen Anniversary Collector 's Edition ) , '' `` Apocalypse Now , '' `` Night of the Living Dead , '' `` One-Eyed Jacks , '' `` Runaway Train '' and `` The Blue Max . '' `` The Omega Man '' miserably fails to accomplish this.Overall the film feels more like a mediocre made-for-tv flick than a theatrical release of its time . It almost has the look and feel of the original `` Star Trek '' series , but without the great writing and characters . The albino villains with their dark hoods and cloaks are reminiscent of the 'villains ' in the episode `` The Return of the Archons . '' In fact , believe it or not , the average Syfy flick is more interesting than `` Omega Man . `` But it has its points of interest : a black female protagonist ( Rosalind Cash ) , a worthy sidekick of sorts ( Paul Koslo ) and the desolate scenes of L.A. , but its main appeal is as a period piece.The DVD I have ( dark blue cover with orange lettering ) features a 20-minute ` making of ' piece , a trailer and a couple other insignificant features.The film runs 98 minutes.GRADE : D+ or C-	-1
Many of the other reviewers here have given this movie high marks , noting that it did what it could under television contraints ( less violence and gore ) . I do n't agree with them . The movie ( or rather the miniseries ) should stand up on its own and not use the television guidelines as an excuse.My problem with this movie is that it did n't frighten me at all . When the vampires showed up , I laughed . Their makeup was horrible , especially the makeup of the head vampire Barlow . He has some weird buck teeth instead of & quot ; normal & quot ; vampire fangs . Another big drawback of Barlow 's character is that he does n't talk . In the book , Barlow was an enticing bad guy . In the movie , he 's pathetic . The acting is just ok , nobody really stands out . Overall , I was really disappointed . I love horror movies , especially vampire movies , but this one was just a waste of my time.I admit , though , that I have a bias . I have read , and enjoyed , the novel Salems Lot , written by Stephen King . The problems of the movie are glaringly obvious when compared to the book . The movie/miniseries combines too many characters into too few characters . Part of the novel 's appeal was that it described a small town slowly dying . In the miniseries , we only see around 10 people in the town . Straker turns into some superhuman man in the movie . His appeal in the book was that he was a normal guy , not a vampire . That was what was frightening.The DVD itself contains only the US miniseries and a trailer . The quality is OK , maybe slightly better than television broadcast quality . Sound is in mono.Bottom Line : Forget the miniseries . Read the book . The best parts of the book have been cut out , or changed , making this a very disappointing miniseries . To see a miniseries based on a Stephen King novel done right , get The Stand .	-1
This film is a World War II drama that lacks romance and the action one might expect of a war movie.Even the isolated attempts to be humorous fail , as a retired group of veterans volunteer to board three German freighters , anchored off the coast of India . One has been transmitting locations of British shipping to a predatory German U-boat.The story is true and the plot is sound enough . However , the screen writing and direction wastes the acting talents of Gregory Peck , Davin Niven , Roger Moore , Trevor Howard , and Patrick Macnee and reduce the overall film appeal to much less than what is otherwise could have offered had these actors been given a free hand . ( And it was clear they did not have that luxury ) .Roger Moore has a romantic scene or two with Barbara Kellerman that is non-romantic , dull , and without either purpose or expectation . And so goes the entire movie.Do not listen to attempts to compare this film with `` The Guns of Navarone '' or `` The Dirty Dozen '' . Those were great movies , and although the theme of `` Sea Wolves '' could have offered the same interest , it did n't -- it did not .	-1
David Spade plays the typical David Spade character here : a smarmy , semi-witty wise guy who is deeply self-involved and frequently unscrupulous . Sophie Marceau plays a cellist with a little dog . Guess who takes her dog so that he can `` find '' it and earn her gratitude ? Guess whether anything will go wrong with the old-hat plan ? Guess who eventually gets on Mlle Marceau 's good side ? So much for the `` plot . '' As a comedy , this is pretty tired stuff . Sadly , to prep the ever-adorable Sophie Marceau for her part as a cello virtuoso , the director seems to have had her coached in bowing and fingering for about five minutes . ... Of course , we usually do n't go to comedies or heroic adventure films for the realistic musicianship of the actors -- but the sloppiness of this element in THIS film is just one more insult to the audience . After all , duh , the e-a Marceau is supposedly playing a professional cellist .	-1
I saw this old classic in my film class several years ago and since I am hearing impaired , I simply never had the chance to learn its story that seemed to hold the audience spellbound for several generations . So here I just sat and stared as the dull b & amp ; w scenes rolled slowly right by and nothing much seemed to happen . But at least I recognized the famous scene at the very ending where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman turned to look at each other by the plane - but that 's all . Sorry , but it was a very very bland experience for me as the deaf viewer .	-1
popular big screen love story . There is little chemistry between Bogart and Bergman characters . The Germans just appeared to be too stupid in the movie . If Bergman 's so called on screen freedom fighter husband is so important , why do n't the Germans just finish him off when they had the chance rather than just trying to keep him from getting to Lisbon , duh ... Ingrid Bergman is mesmerizing though , she deserves 5 stars .	-1
Humphrey Bogart ( Rick ) is a master of the outer cold/inner warmth style . Ingrid Bergman ( Ilsa ) glows in her authentic softness.In the end , Rick makes the best ( right ) decisions for the individuals involved , and because of this , their actions are also good for society . This movie really deserves five stars .	-1
A classic ? I do n't think that I have ever seen such an artificial and boring love story in my entire life.I did n't cry . I moaned and groaned , and waited to get these two people that I did n't care about off my T.V . screen . I just did not like any of the characters . The actors were like lifeless cardboard cut-outs , reading their lines.It 's an old classic to some , but definitely not for everybody .	-1
How on earth did this movie ever become such an icon ? It 's a low-budget , grade B , black-and-white movie almost all of which is set in a bar . It 's even got a fake airplane . The only thing it 's got going for it is a couple of big name actors . And they delivered routine performances . What , pray tell , is exceptional about this film ? It 's essentially a stage play and not a very good one at that .	-1
Every artist has a bomb in them . This is one of Hitchcock's.No good purpose is served by pretending to like this movie-seems like the editors and a good chunk of reviewers put metaphorical horse blinders on while watching because an ostensibly `` great '' director is overseeing it . It 's a dumb movie no matter who is at the helm . The comedy is sub-par , Cary Grant is given inane and foppish dialogue as he tries to woo Eva Marie Saint 's character , and the intrigue is nonexistent ; you can get much more adventure out of the worst of the James Bond films.We all look back fondly on the classics in any medium . That said , a critical eye should separate the wheat from the chaff . Finding this glass-jawed lightweight a great timepiece of the 50s memorable lacks discernment . I will give it one thing ... the score is superb . It does alot of the work in terms of atmosphere that the visual part of the flick is unable to provide.Bottom line , if you 're on a classic movie tear , save yourself a painful 2+ hours and do n't bother with this malarkey . Liberate thyself from the tyranny of blind artist worship for the sake of banal vanity .	-1
It 's not the fact that they allow reviews to be published before a review is even out . That annoys me . It 's not that they sometimes do n't put aspect ratios up or put the wrong aspect ratios up . That annoys me . What REALLY annoys me is that they take reviews from other previously released discs , in this instance old DVDs of North by Northwest , and link them to a new disc like this ( which is n't even out as I type this ) , the WBs 50th anniversary North by Northwest DVD . I guess the braniacs at Amazon.com and Amazon.UK do n't think that anyone cares about the disc itself . Anyway , this is why I am giving Amazon 1 star . I would give them a 0 if they allowed me to . A pox ...	-1
First let me say this : I AM NOT A KATHARINE HEPBURN FAN . I find her mannerisms , rapid fire speech , twittering high pitched voice and her hyperactive personality too much for me ! She gets on my nerves and the best scene in this movie is when Cary Grant pushes her through the door and she falls flat . I only wish when she had fallen she would n't have gotten back up and the film would have ended right there . For this reason I have never been able to sit through an entire showing of this film , despite the star power of Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart who make up for what is lacking in its leading lady ... ( Just my opinion ) . I know I 'm in the minority here and we all have different tastes , so please , no offense to Hepburn admirers . I actually have two movies of hers that I love her in ... ( Stage Door ( 1937 ) and Dragon Seed ( 1944 ) . Its because in those films she toned down her mannerisms and was n't unlikeable . Perhaps its just the hyperactivity that gets to me , I do n't know . I ca n't give this film an honest critique because I 've never been able to sit through an entire showing of it . I either fall asleep or get too much of Hepburn ( who in my opinion was severely overrated as an actress ... .of all the golden era actresses , needless to say she is my least favorite ... . ) . So this review of & quot ; The Philadelphia Story & quot ; may be unfair and biased . One thing is certain ... .the Oscar that Jimmy Stewart won for this was given to him because the Academy overlooked him the year before in & quot ; Mr. Smith Goes to Washington & quot ; . His role is truly secondary to Hepburn 's and Grant 's . The Oscar that year by Stewart 's own admission should have gone to Henry Fonda for & quot ; The Grapes of Wrath & quot ; . As I said , I 'm in the minority here but we all have different tastes . If you 're like me and do n't like Hepburn , then stay away from this one .	-1
One of the greatest movies ever made . One of the worst DVD transfers of a major movie by a major studio . Parts of the movie have a crystal sharp picture than one would expect of a DVD . Others scenes are grainy beyond belief . I have all of Ed Wood 's movies on DVD and the picture quality is overall superior . What kind of a world do we live in where Ed Wood movies are restored and John Huston movies are treated like a $ 20 mule ? I saw a laser disk of this years ago that had reasonably good video . Wish Warner had borried it instead of whatever they used . Of course it 's a great movie . The movie deserves 500 stars and the DVD zero . And to quote Bogie & quot ; Fred C. Dobbs do n't say nothing he do n't mean. & quot ;	-1
I received the case and the second CD with the specials on it but did not receive the movie . I wrote through Amazon twice to get some satisfaction and never heard a word back from the vendor . I am kind of shocked to be treated like this as I have ordered through Amazon many times and have never had someone be so uncaring as to not even reply when I have sent two emails about my dissatisfaction . I will never order from this vendor again .	-1
My goodness , I ca n't believe I watched this entire movie . I kept waiting for it to improve , and nope . Awful the entire way through .	-1
I am not a big fan of black comedies and it was difficult for me to imagine Cary Grant and director Frank Capra would team up to produce this movie . This comedy is appropriate for the Halloween night but you do n't get scared by the gentle humor and boring run ; at times you may feel it is a drag . I did not enjoy the humor strenuously portrayed by Cary Grant . The movie has constant morbid atmosphere in the air , the house is located right on a cemetery , and his new wife lives next door and his two aunts have 12 dead bodies of old men in the basement ; a part of their mercy killing with wine laced with arsenic.Mortimer Brewster ( Cary Grant ) , a New York critic of drama marries Elaine Harper ( Priscilla Lane ) , the girl next door . Before heading off to Niagara Falls for the honeymoon , Mortimer stops in to see his aunts , Abby Brewster ( Josephine Hull ) and Martha Brewster ( Jean Adair ) , two sweet little old ladies who donate toys to charity and care for their nephew Teddy Brewster ( John Alexander ) , a bugle blowing nut-bag who thinks he 's President Roosevelt . To make matters worse , Mortimer 's deranged and dangerous brother Jonathan ( Raymond Massey ) , while on the run from the law , stops by with a dead body in the trunk of his car and a drunken plastic surgeon named Herman Einstein ( Peter Lorre ) . The place is constantly visited by the local police in search of a missing cop . Officer Patrick O'Hara ( Jack Carson ) as a bumbling cop adds plenty to the confusion and some humor , and the character of Jonathan Brewster which clearly is a direct tribute to Boris Karlof . Peter Lorre as his drunken German sidekick is a riot ; bugging his eyes and flinching through the entire film does his best to add a depth to the morbidity of the film.Stanley Kubrick worked on 'Dr . Strangelove ' and Frank Capra did the same with this movie . But I still feel Capra is more suited all the great classics he ever made , and Cary Grant is suited for all the romantic movies he made with some of the most beautiful and talented women of Hollywood . If you are not a fan of horror films , then you have little to enjoy this movie.1.The Premiere Frank Capra Collection ( Mr. Smith Goes to Washington / It Happened One Night / You Ca n't Take It with You / Mr . Deeds Goes to Town / American Madness / Frank Capra 's American Dream ) 2.The Cary Grant Signature Collection ( Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House / Destination Tokyo / The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer / My Favorite Wife / Night and Day ) 3.The Cary Grant Box Set ( Holiday / Only Angels Have Wings / The Talk of the Town / His Girl Friday / The Awful Truth )	-1
I tried to watch this and could n't . Anne 's legs kept distracting me from the mind deadening godawful dialog -- -and her legs were n't even that good . Despite the scenery , effects and main idea , it 's still not worth watching as a film . Want a great SF film ? Watch Fifth Element or Aliens	-1
There are a handful of 1950 's sci-fi movies that have a big reputation - `` When Worlds Collide '' , `` The Thing From Another World '' , `` Forbidden Planet '' , and `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' . Unfortunately , only `` The Day The Earth Stood Still '' really stands up ( except the robot ) .This movie has big concepts , and none of them work anymore , if they ever did . Part thriller , part drama , part mad-scientist melodrama . There are just too many things going on , and all of them `` supposedly '' explained in long-winded speeches that answer nothing . `` Forbidden Planet '' starts off looking much like Star Trek TOS , including the transporter . In reality , ST : TOS creator Gene Roddenberry admits this movie formed part of the basis for Star Trek . In a nutshell , a United Planets space cruiser captained by Leslie Nielsen lands on Altair , against the wishes of its inhabitant , Dr. Morbius , a remnant from a previous expedition . He and his 25 year old daughter ( Anne Francis ) are the only humans on the planet . There is also a robot called `` Robbie '' , of course , similar to that of the `` Lost in Space '' series . The doctor reluctantly shows the others his discovery about an ancient extinct race called the Krell . The `` big '' ending is too weird and funny to be described.The entire robot aspect and the tasks he performs is just silly ( in the `` Lost In Space '' vein ) . Earl Holliman 's character of `` Cookie '' was put in for comedic effect - unfortunately most has to do with his dealings with the robot - including getting the robot to make bourbon - which only adds to the silliness.The actors are quite serious and for the most part are OK. Leslie Nielsen plays it straight . Anne Francis is entertaining as the daughter who is initially somewhat innocent and ignorant of sex . As might be guessed , the captain ends up with her.The sets are incredibly hokey . The all-electronic score does not help . Ambitious , atrociously fake special effects that probably were OK in 1956 . Possibly the goofiest sci-fi movie ever . Do n't get me wrong - this is a well-made and well-intentioned movie , but as with `` When Worlds Collide '' and `` The Thing ... '' , it is recommended only for a laugh.A further insult is that the robot is not accurately depicted on the DVD cover and he never holds anyone in his arms .	-1
The blu ray version is barely superior to the DVD ... it is very grainy.Not worth the upgrade .	-1
Five short stories that come from a boy 's haunted comic book , which are all are ridiculous and boring . This movie was supposed to be funny , and I guess it is . It is so pathetic that you just have to laugh at how hopeless it is .	-1
Both feature little tales mixing horror with comedy . Both were written by famous writers and directors . Both presented good actors playing the characters . What does both do n't have in common ? Creepshow is bad but Tales From The Crypt do n't . I feel like I was cheated by the cover , title and the [ garbage ] lines written in front an back of the cover . If you 're looking for intelligent horror comedy , featuring different kinds of morals , look elsewhere , better yet , go watch Tales From The Crypt . Watching Creepshow you will feel really dumb because the tales do n't have a meaning at all . You do n't need to own it just because you 're a Stephen King fan ( like me ) , do yourself a favor and read his books instead . 0 stars !	-1
Dispite the presence of the fantastic Vicent Price ... this movie looks like a high school play ... People stuck in a so called Haunted House and yet go wandering off by themselves and putting themselves in danger..I can see the script for Carolyn Craig ... '' lighty scream '' 'BIG SCREAM ' 'light scream ' 'unfinished scream ' ... It is so bad , it would a great film to rent for a party and just sit and make fun of it ...	-1
How does one enjoy a movie when there are no characters to like ? Perhaps if we were not to think these 'guys ' were likable , I would have felt differently . But , sadly , that is not the case . Pathetic , selfish men trapped in marginal film .	-1
I love the picture quality . The color and grain are perfect for my taste . But I 'm having a huge problem with the musical numbers . The soundtrack is fine during the dialogue , but as soon as a musical number starts , the vocals drop . I have tried every single sound channel , and this does n't fix it . I have the sound coming from the tv as I ca n't afford a sound system at the moment . I 've even tried changing the sound on the tv . Any ideas ? I tried contacting Warner Home Video months and months ago , but they have never responded .	-1
I was pleased to find this film at a local store ; I 'd seen the `` New York , New York It 's a Wonderful Town '' scene a dozen times . Now I know why : it 's the only really good song and dance number in the whole movie . I love Hollywood musicals and have always been a huge Gene Kelly fan . `` On The Town '' is incredibly insipid when compared to other Kelly movies and a miserable waste of Ann Miller 's wonderful talent . Go buy `` Singing in the Rain '' and `` Kiss Me Kate '' to find out what these two people can really do ; save your money here .	-1
`` Boy Meets Girl '' was a successful 1935 Broadway play and looks very much like a Marx Brothers film from that same period , with Marie Wilson and Bruce Lester playing the love struck couple , Dick Foran playing the rival , and Jimmy Cagney , Pat O'Brien , and Ralph Bellamy in the Marx Brothers ' roles . Unfortunately , the Irish Mafia , despite their many talents , were no Marx Brothers clones , so the film does n't really jump and shout with the Marx Brother 's zany brand of comedy.Nonetheless , the film does have its moments , and Cagney 's on screen hamming it up is surely worth a look . Marie Wilson 's `` dumb blonde '' routine serves her well , and there 's even a short sequence with Ronald Reagan at a film premiere.BTW - the film being premiered is called `` The White Rajah '' which is an inside joke among Warner Brothers staff about a terrible screenplay that Errol Flynn wrote and wanted to turn into a film . Flynn is also called an `` Englishman '' when of course he was an Australian . Flynn was a member of the Irish Mafia , and a good friend of Reagan , so the insults are clearly meant to be taken light heartedly.The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon who directed more than 100 films between 1922 and 1954 . He was part of the Warner 's production team that cranked out a half dozen films a year , most of them B films . Among his notable films were `` The Singing Fool '' ( 1928 ) , `` Knute Rockne All American '' ( 1940 ) and `` The Fighting Sullivans '' ( 1944 ) .Bacon has the unusual distinction of being the main director for Cagney 's non-gangster films , like `` The Oklahoma Kid '' ( 1939 ) , `` Devil Dogs of the Air '' ( 1935 ) , `` Here Comes the Navy '' ( 1934 ) , `` The Picture Snatcher '' ( 1933 ) , `` Footlight Parade '' ( 1933 ) , etc.1938 was a pretty good year for films . The top grossing films were `` You Ca n't Take it With You '' , `` The Adventures of Robin Hood '' , ` Boys Town '' , `` Alexander 's Ragtime Band '' , `` Sweethearts '' , and `` Marie Antoinette '' . The Oscars were to `` You Ca n't Take it With You '' ( Picture , Director ) , `` Boys Town '' ( Actor ) , and `` Jezebel '' ( Actress ) . Other notable films released that year were `` Algiers '' , Cagney and O'Brien in `` Angels with Dirty Faces '' , John Garfield 's film debut in `` Four Daughters '' and Gable and Tracey in `` Test Pilot '' .The NY Times said `` the picture has retained humor and a few gustily playful touches '' but `` The Benson & Law writing firm as portrayed by James Cagney and Pat O'Brien has lost some of the finer edges of characterization it had on the stage ... '' Bottom line - a treat for Cagney fans , but otherwise a forgettable attempt at screwball comedy .	-1
Max Reinhardt 's sound-film career started and ended with A MIDSUMMER NIGHT 'S DREAM ( AMND ) . Reinhardt ( originally Goldmann ) was a noted European stage director/producer who tried to make the jump to sound film . Not everything that was successful in live theater ( especially on European stages during the 20 's and 30 's ) ended up a cinematic hit ( especially with American film audiences ) during the same period . AMND is an expensive exhibit A. Reinhardt was in the midst of preparing his next film for Warner Bros. ( working title appears to have been `` DANTON '' ) when the disastrous box office results came in from AMND . This , among other things , lead Warners to promptly terminate their film-directing arrangements with Reinhardt.AMND was puffed up with some of Warners ' major stars of the time , but it is difficult -- make that painful and plain embarrassing -- to watch them in such a silly film . Apparently , Warners was apprehensive from the start . At least two featurettes or shorts were produced by the studio to plug its own film ( both are included as extras on this DVD ) .Film restoration and transfer are suburb , complete with digital sound . Obviously a fair amount of money and effort went into this release . The question is , why ? Warner Home Video has not done the same for many/most of its recent releases of classic films on DVD including the shabby treatment afforded THE ERROL FLYNN SIGNATURE COLLECTION.The extras make this DVD worth buying . They include the promotional short A DREAM COMES TRUE which includes the only known appearance of classic film-score composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold in a sound film ( a tad brief at only 49 seconds ) . Plus an early Olivia de Havilland screen test ( there are two scenes ) . While it is obvious that the tests have nothing to do with AMND , apparently they were directed by Reinhardt perhaps in preparation for his second sound film ( which was never produced ) . Each scene is a bit long , but both are delightful to watch as a plucky and pudgy de Havilland delivers over-the-top performances . Separately , the DVD extras rate at least three stars , the film barely one.William Flanigan , Ph.D .	-1
Scene clips are great . The & # 34 ; Stars & # 34 ; hosting this this movie are annoying.I could only watch half of this movie because it is long , and amazon on gives you a 20 hour rental .	-1
To be fair to this movie , I have changed over the months . I now find watch shoot-em'-up stuff to be very unpleasant . As a seriously religious person I am totally turned-off by fake religion/magic events . I was told this was a great movie , and before becoming sensitive to violence , I might have liked it . Too much reliance on special effects/violence and magic for my taste .	-1
What 's all the ballyhoo about ? Genre defining ? Maybe if the genre was SUCK . How could 50,000 [ MATRIX ] fans be wrong ? For every reason in the book . I guess you have to be hooked up to a hoover vacuum cleaner to really enjoy this useless , dead-fly-on-the-sill , dust-ball-in-the-corner , two-year-old-christmas-tinsel of a movie . I can just hear one of the ten-thousand copies of THE MATRIX video talking to me as I pass it by in the local rental store , `` Why do you hate me ? Why do n't you just simmer down ... '' First of all , Keanu Reeves is about as wooden an actor as you can get . Even Mark Hamill had some depth playing an everyman , blank slate of an action hero who takes a similar archetypal journey . I 'm just surprised Keanu had brains enough to take the correct pill so this shinola-load of a plot could continue . But I digress ? Larry `` Laurence '' Fishburne plays his part like he 's recording a books-on-tape version of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY . I 'm surprised , because he worked out so well in SCHOOL DAZE and APOCALYPSE NOW . But I ca n't fault the actors really , they were handed this shlock of a script to a movie which has every yo-yo thinking they are better off somehow for having experienced this ? I guess this flick is about as challenging , mentally , as that other over-rated junkpile GLADIATOR . Does all this cheap philosophy really get the brain tumors worked up ? Its like dropping a shiney object in a pond and watching all the fish clamor after it . This movie was actually pretty bland and full of holes if you remove the special effects . I found the references to ALICE IN WONDERLAND heavy-handed and cheesey . I love ALICE IN WONDERLAND and recommend sitting down to read that book as an alternative to viewing this snooze of a movie . I was surprised they did n't use the Jefferson Airplane song WHITE RABBIT - or at least have a techno-monstrosity version of it ? Maybe they did and I was too zoned out of boredom to notice . `` Wow , we are really in an faux-reality controlled by the very machines we created ? Sheesh - you do n't say ? Better roll out some special effects to put a hurtin ' to these roving mongoloid footballs ... '' THE ORACLE should have tried cooking up some fried eggs , because the cast was certainly wearing it on their faces . I guess the only redeeming ounce of quality in this thing was the certifiably cool robo-villain , AGENT SMITH . I was amazed by him - he was like a DEVO record actualized . Stomping , in his own special Agent Smith way , on the skulls of our thinly drawn heroes . I imagined Agent Smith wearing a huge DELETE button around his neck , erasing this movie as he went along . Then , there were so many of him in the sequel MATRIX RELOADED - THE SEARCH FOR MORE MONEY , I felt certain at least one of the Agent Smiths would have a DELETE button stowed away in his breast pocket ? That would have been worth the eight bucks . But now I 'm obviously getting into SPACEBALLS territory . I could n't get this far without offering some alternative selections to cure a paying audience of this infection , now could I ? For starters : in addition to SPACEBALLS , 2001 : A SPACE ODYESSEY , EMPIRE STRIKES BACK , BLADERUNNER , ALIEN ( S ) , TOTAL RECALL , STARSHIP TROOPERS , CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND , MARS ATTACKS , 12 MONKEYS , THE THING , THEY LIVE ! , TIME BANDITS , THX-1138 , ENEMY MINE , PREDATOR and ROBOCOP - I offer the darkly brilliant DARK CITY . Yes , this movie will be observed as slow and boring by the five star gushers here ; but in terms of originality , vibrance , and just plain storytelling know-how - well it leaves THE MATRIX slithering in the dust . DARK CITY was like Alfred Hitchcock had returned from his deep carbon freeze , slipped on a pair of nice fitting SCI-FI shoes and went to bat for us one more time.So , to answer the video copy of THE MATRIX sitting on the local store shelf , `` why do you hate me so ? '' Well , I do n't hate you . I just think you are a mindless twerp of a movie that champions every idiotic impulse imaginable in the American psyche . This thing is about as sophisticated as a Broadway musical . NEO is a vapid , mindless puke of a character if I ever saw one - and the casting of TED LOGAN in that role was probably the only right move the directors made ? CAPTAIN EO - sorry , I meant NEO - wants to rock and roll so badly , that it hurts . Better call Deputy Van Halen in to save the day ! This movie deserves half a star - but I gave it two stars only because they represent the two hours of my life I will never get back . This is the only consolation I could find ... for now.Good luck boys , I 'm sure the series will be a hit .	-1
I almost gave this movie three stars , but I just ca n't . Kudos to the filmmakers for having a little more imagination than most who attempt to bring science fiction to the screen , but to me this movie was stupid to the core , and all the balletic violence and the beautiful slow-motion fall of thousands of shell casings ca n't make up for the stupidity . From the absurd notion that human bodies are power sources ( just ask a physicist to estimate the thermodynamic efficiency of human metabolic processes ) to the Deus Ex Machina resolution ( Keanu as Messiah - & quot ; He 's the one ! & quot ; ) , the noise and banality overwhelms what is original in this film . It is a visual feast , and the Oracle as cookie-baking Mom was fun , but I think this film is highly overrated .	-1
This was a horrible movie . It was n't exciting until the last 30 minutes and even then I did n't jump off my seat . Most of the things I did n't even get . Making a trilogy out of the Matrix is a horrible idea .	-1
Along with Face/Off this is one over rated pilesof Hollywood garbage , instead of watching this painfull excuse of a movie rent out Dark City for basically the same plot premise but with alot more thought .	-1
The Matrix ( The Wachowski Brothers , 1999 ) So it had been five years since I saw The Matrix . When I originally saw it , I was unimpressed by it ; I did n't notice the special effects . ( Some people think I 'm exaggerating when I say that . I honestly had no idea what people were talking about when they mentioned the bullet-time effects in the movie until almost two years later . ) I obviously did n't notice much else , either . I gave it the most lukewarm of positive reviews . But because it has entered into the popular culture as such an influential reference , it 's stayed on my mind . The ideas behind the film are intriguing , and I did finally figure out what bullet-time was after watching The Art of War , which was mediocre , but ( when I first saw it ) superior to The Matrix . Because of all this , when it popped up on a movie channel a couple of nights ago , I decided to give it another go-round , figuring I 'd change my opinion of the movie.I have . It 's even worse than I originally thought it was.The ideas certainly remain intriguing , but the Wachowski brothers take Morpheus ( Apocalypse Now 's Larry Fishburne , no matter what he 's calling himself these days ) , who 's supposed to be a kind of zen master , and has him spell everything out so that his disciple , Neo ( Keanu Reeves , looking about as full of emotion here as he was in Dracula ) . The love-interest subplot between Neo and Trinity ( Memento maven Moss ... Carrie-Anne Moss ) has so little meat on its bones that the brothers have to resort to a tear-filled `` I love you '' scene so the audience gets any clue there 's a romantic subplot at all . The human special effects are unbearably cheesy ( wire-fu looks even stupider when in slow motion ) , and the bullet-time has been done so much better in so many other movies I wonder that anyone noticed it . The only special effect that impressed me is the only one that impressed me five years ago , the rushing racks of guns.That it has inspired five years of discussion about its meaning is not in any way a testament to its value as a film ; Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is still being discussed after a quarter-century . A better film could have easily inspired the same amount of discussion . More , in fact , and it would have had even more levels . This one just happened to get lucky . **	-1
I ca n't understand why everyone is so dedicated to this movie . I do n't see anything so original about this very familiar story . I liked it the first time when it was called Star Wars , or Alice and Wonderland , or even THE BIBLE . Do n't get me wrong , I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne , he was a bad mother ; shut your mouth . The special effects do n't really do it for me either . The idea of several cameras set up to capture a fluid action is n't a new one . This was the whole idea behind the advent of the motion picture camera , so just get over it people please . There are so many other quality pictures out there so just pick those up instead . THAT 'S IT I 'M DONE !	-1
I had high expectations for this movie ! Everybody kept saying that it is the best movie of all time . Well , this movie is one of the worst if you ask me ! Sure the idea is great , but plot holes , a lot more talking than action , and the way the film was handled just made this one total crap ! The only exciting part about this movie is the last ten minutes when Neo and Trinity go out and save Morpheus . That 's it . Otherwise , it 's not worth your time and money !	-1
NOT VERY HELPFUL TO ME , BUT DOESNT MEAN IT WONT BE FOR SOMEONE.MY CLASS WAS VERY BORED WIITH THE MOVIE , BUT NOT THE BOOK .	-1
If this DVD is an example of overseas quality control , I choose to have nothing to do with it . Not once , but twice I found this product to be unacceptable . The video quality is below average and the audio quality leaves much to be desired ( including hearing it as the volume fluctuates all over the decible scale ) . Not on my must buy list !	-1
If you 're a sword-and-sandals movie fan , you do n't need me to tell you about the movie 's content . But the Korean pressing is , in quality , only so-so ( I got better results , including better sound and deeper color , by DVD-recording off of Turner Classic Movies ) , but it does carry English subtitles , though laughingly attenuated . If this is your only access to Peter Ustinov as a bearded Nero and sylphid Deborah Kerr as the willowy damsel Lygia under chase by the black bull , then you ca n't do much worse than buy this copy . The original movie was pre-Cinema Scope so the ratio is 1:1.33 and you 're not missing anything , widescreen-wise . Call it the poor man 's tour of ancient Rome : fire , circuses , crucifixions , and all -- the stuff that makes your TV screen pant and sweat and earn its wattage .	-1
After viewing the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao I must agree with the March 10th , 2000 reviewer who states strongly that this is just a solid `` B '' film.When I was growing up I spent many hours in movie theaters watching Fantasy and Sci-Fi films . George Pal movies were always among my favorites and still are . To make statements that the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao was George Pal 's greatest film is unfounded . Have these people ever watched the Time Machine or War of the Worlds ? If we are talking about great Fantasy or Sci-Fi movies , which George Pal should be remembered for , then you do n't get much better than these two.The only credit to this film is the scene where Dr. Lao shows the town 's people the movie clips of the Roman city being destroyed by a volcanic eruption . The eruption scenes are taken from another George Pal classic fantasy film , Atlantis the Lost Continent . Now there is a great film to entertain the children . The only problem with Atlantis the Lost Continent is that for some unknown reason it has not yet been released on DVD . For those of us out there that still enjoy great fantasy films from the past , drop the studio a line and lets get this one on the market .	-1
Ok , I had high hopes for this movie , especially being a cool plot idea where Allied spies infiltrate a hard-to-reach German stronghold . Starring Clint Eastwood also added to this hope . In reality , this hope was dashed by annoying acting performance from both Clint Eastwood and most especially Richard Burton , who now is top of my list of most annoying actors ever ( alongside Hayden Christensen ) . The problem here , is that Burton takes the lead in a condescending `` father-knows-best '' style , and is n't even cooperative with Eastwood in the movie . For 2 guys that are supposed to be on the same side , I found myself asking through the entire movie what Eastwood was even doing there.Pros : - Breathtaking scenery- Cool ideaCons : - Poorly executed- Major historical inaccuracies ( this is more forgivable since , afterall , it *is* a movie ) - No actual German spoken in the movie . Subtitles are fine . Why not use them ? - Eastwood hardly speaks in this movie , is portrayed as woussy second-fiddle to Burton , which is not Eastwood at all . Eastwood should be the alpha male here . Who knows why he took a backseat role in this movie.- Burton = Stilted wooden vacuous acting . To even call it acting is bequeathing Burton a glorious compliment that I do n't wish to gift to him . Annoying acting and voice . The lines he utters when walking into the German training camp make me shake my head in disbelief that people like him can be regarded as quality by anyone of reasonable or greater intelligence and standards.Overall , there 's far better WWII movies out there ( such as Saving Private Ryan , Kelly 's Heros , The Dirty Dozen , and the Band of Brothers series ) , so I do n't see any point wasting time with this one .	-1
Typical blockbuster war flick from the mid-60s . A couple of big-buck movie stars ( Richard Burton & Clint Eastwood , ) exotic foreign locales , lots of big explosions , and a roach nest of enemy soldiers who , conveniently , seem incapable of hitting the broad side of a barn . From ten feet . With a 100-round sub-machine gun on a tripod . With a back wind.The set-up 's fairly intriguing : An American general with a great deal of knowledge of the pending Allied invasion of Europe is captured by the Germans and held in the remote stronghold Schloss Alden . High in the Swiss Alps , Schloss Alden is a practically impregnable fortress , guarded by a regiment of highly trained Germans . Enter British Major Richard Burton and American Lieutenant Clint Eastwood , a pair of special forces types who , along with a few only highly trained soldiers , plan to parachute into the region , penetrate the castle in which the general is being held and kidnap the captor to safety . Hopefully before he talks.I wanted to like WHERE EAGLES DARE , but could n't . In fact , until I started writing this review I had it pegged at ( a weak ) three stars , but I found I had nothing good to say about it . This movie might work if you simply want to shut down your frontal cortex and enjoy an exciting , escapist movie with a lot of action and some thrills ( major one happens on the cable car the boys take up to and down from the castle . ) I do n't need war movies to be quasi-documentaries , but they do need to have a minimal degree of plausibility . I did n't believe a minute of this movie . The first instance of implausibility occurred early on , with the introduction , as the tagline has it , of `` The Beautiful Frauleins ( who ) are Allied Agents ! '' Why female agents ? They are n't vital to the plot , so my guess is they ( Mary Ure , the British special agent , Ingrid Pitt , the undercover resistance fighter ) are there to add spice and appeal to a wider demographic . And besides , they give Richard Burton a chance to growl a titillating `` Take your clothes off ! '' to Ure for a trailer tease . And tease it is , since in the movie he quickly follows that line with `` Not the way you think I mean . '' Another , larger , implausibility is the movie 's host of double- and triple-agents , suspected moles in MI-5 , and deceptions layered on deceptions . It 's a Cold War motif grafted onto a World War Two movie , and it does n't really fit . Nor did I buy the ease with which Burton and Eastwood infiltrated their way into the German army . They don German uniforms and poof , they 're new arrivals from somewhere who are instantly accepted as real Germans . The language and accent issue , probably wisely , is virtually ignored by the movie , with the hope the audience will do the same.I could go on , but I 've wasted enough time watching this movie and do n't want to spend a lot of time dredging up unpleasant memories . Burton was the bigger star back then , and his role is proportionately larger . He 's given pages of dialogue to read , is allowed to figure out what the enemy 's up to and how to outwit them , while Eastwood is pretty much left to snarl an `` If you do n't tell me what 's going on I 'm out of here ? '' every ten minutes or so . I did n't hate WHERE EAGLES DARE , but I fought it almost every step of the way .	-1
This film marked one of the first starring roles for film legend Humphrey Bogart . Bogart plays a gangster , Duke Mangee , who with his gang , is on the run from the law . The film starts out when Leslie Howard wanders into a small desert gas station to get some food and runs into Bette Davis . They almost instantly take to each other . They discuss the book of poetry she is reading and he tells her he used to be a writer , but he has n't written anything in a long time because he is uninspired . Davis , who has spent most of her life in the desert and wants desperatly to move to her birth place in France , finds the stranger very intriguing . They talk and she asks him if he wants to run away with her to France , but he has been there and does n't want to go back . Then touble strikes when Howard catches a ride with a couple and they run into Bogart and his gang down the road . Bogart takes the couples car and leaves them all in the desert . Apparently he has picked Davis 's gas station to rendezbous with his girl . Howard rushes back to tell Davis they are coming . Of coarse , they are already there . Bogart holds them hostage while he waits and drinks . Howard decides he is love with Davis and strikes an interesting deal with Bogart for her life . The film ends with a fatal shootout.This movie was suppose to be serious , but time is catching up to it . Davis and Howard are good , but their affair is almost comic . Bogart totaly overacts as the tough guy , Duke . The rest of the cast is okay at best . The ending of the film is anticlimatic which pretty much sumarizes the whole film . This is a film that would interest young Davis and Bogart fans .	-1
I watched this movie in my 7th grade class last year and it is BAD . It does n't even have a decent story line . Oh , wait . Scratch that . It does n't have a story line at all . It is about as deep as a normal family 's vacation video because that 's pretty much what is . Two spoiled little girls run around Paris for week and meet two French boys . Sound interesting ? It is n't . The French boys are the only characters that make this movie worthy of one star . The script does try to squeeze some humor into the movie and does n't do very well . All the humor apart from the French boys ' bad English is very childish . The movie even ends with the most stupid climax I have ever seen which involves a & quot ; clean water treaty & quot ; ( the girls ' grandpa is the U.S. ambassador to France. ) . The Olsen were probably more interested in the trip to Paris than making a quality film when they payed for it themselves . If you 're a fan of the twins , you 'll probably like this movie , but if you want a great movie that you 're kids will always love , look elsewhere . How this movie actually made the top selling videos chart is beyond me . Even the price is horrible . I bet that more than half of the families who bought it watched it for two months ( or until the next Disney film ) and then let it sit on the shelf forever .	-1
This movie was disgusting ! For one thing , what stupid parent would send their kid to Paris if they do n't know what 's going on in the real world ? Not to mention that they were rude , bratty and sarcastic . The hairdos and makeup was nice , but unfortunately that was all I liked about it . I mean , hello ? There was absolutely no plot to this movie ! The Olsens are just getting worse and worse . This movie is a far cry from the rest of what the Olsens have produced . Rent this if you want to throw up !	-1
Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn star in this stomach-turning film based on Nicholas Sparks 's sappy novel . Penn plays a Chicago Tribune researcher who finds the title `` character '' on a beach . After her boss publishes the mushy contents , other messages appear . Penn and her associates track down the cheesy Romeo , and she travels to his home on the North Carolina 's Outer Banks . Of course , she does not reveal the reason for her visit , and falls in love with him . You can imagine the dramatic possibilities that follow . In fact , you 've seen them before.Almost nothing in the film rings true . Every twist is predictable and unbelievable , devised only to tug at the heartstrings . Could Costner truly be this obsessed with his dead wife and still love Penn- a woman with whom he has nothing in common ? Possibly , but the filmmakers make no effort to show what draws these two very different people to one another . Instead , their attraction is assumed . Without it there 's no film . The idea that anyone , let alone Penn 's educated newspaper-woman , would even consider speaking with Costner 's brooding , troubled , and occasionally violent boat-builder strains credibility . Instead of a man with a romantic nature , we get a man caught between obsessive-compulsive disorder and a coma.Only the supporting players survive with their dignity intact . Robbie Coltrane does a nice turn as Penn 's boss , and Paul Newman triumphs over the material as Costner 's crusty father .	-1
`` Then I dried her . '' ( Was she a salt cod ? ) `` She flew away '' ( wings flapping ? ) . For the record : `` I 'm scared '' is not a line to be repeated eight times in two hours by adult actors . Shame on a smart cast for mouthing the worst dialogue of all time . Shame on the people who funded this plodding , plotless potato . Nicholas Sparks writes plain ( read `` dull '' ) talk . He never met a cliche he did n't like . I never met a better person . She never did a bad thing . Her hope was like a flower in the wind . Her smile lit up a room , a city , a planet , a universe , a black hole . He never wrote an interesting word . When I think of the money spent on this waste of celluloid . People might have been fed , New Orleans saved , a tree spared . Be scared . Be very , very scared . Did this tragic nothing lead to a great actor 's death ? You 've been warned : `` Message In A Bottle '' ( glug glug ) will give you mental indigestion . Do n't overestimate your ability to swallow bilge ( note boat reference - get it ? get it ? Am I being too obvious ? Hmm . Wow . Oh . ) Whispers : `` I love you . '' Murmurs : `` I love you , too . '' They kiss . Roll over in bed twice . Her foot gets stuck in his crotch . Dawn . Betrayal . He leaves . Paul Newman blows a big one . Message This .	-1
Wanted to escape this world for a while with an overly sweet romance and stiff alcoholic beverage . Generally a Nicholas Sparks movie will scratch that itch . Ended up balling my eyes out in a bad way ( This wer n't no Notebook yew all ) . And Kevin Costner really could have buffed up a little more for this movie ( Come on Coster , you know method acting . You were a ship builder in this one . Which means hot with & # 34 ; large & # 34 ; muscles not & # 34 ; lard & # 34 ; muscles -- maybe something got lost in translation in the directors notes ) . Sheeeesh . BTW Robin Wright was marvelous which is why I gave it one star because she was the only one star in it ... bada bing ...	-1
Wow . I have a real dilemma here . I 'm sitting here trying to figure out a way to say as delicately as possible that this movie is a real piece of crap . I could start in on some sarcasm , because I really enjoy being sarcastic at the right moment ... .something like , go ahead , watch Message in a Bottle if you are on death row and have nothing better to do . Before I get too nasty , maybe I should explain.First off , no , I did n't read the book . Maybe that would 've helped . I think practically everyone I 've ever known who read the book before seeing the movie , still said , `` The book was better . '' So , knowing that , I say the book HAS to be better because the movie was so bad.Message in a Bottle begins in a somewhat interesting fashion . Theresa , played by Robin Wright Penn , is jogging along the beach and finds a message in a bottle . It appears to be a love letter of sorts to a woman named Catherine . Theresa is so intrigued with this letter that she shows the lady at the inn , her co-workers , that dog of the neighbors that bites everyone ... .sorry , this sarcasm just takes over my body sometimes.So , Theresa does research for a Chicago newspaper and a columnist for the paper decides to print the letter . It 's content is intriguing to everyone , so , since she found the letter , she starts researching its origin . This is one of few things I found sort of interesting . The methods employed in tracking down the author of the message in a bottle kept me interested . But unfortunately , that part of the movie lasts about 5 minutes tops . Then , I was instantly bored again.So , she tracks down the origin of the message , and goes on a mission to exploit , I mean FIND , this Ernest Hemmingway of bottled messages . Kevin Costner , who plays Garet Blake , churns out his usual monotone performance . Do n't get me wrong . There are some Kevin Costner movies I really like . Honestly , I do . But , those have been the movies where the storyline fashioned itself around his calm , everyman demeanor . This movie moves too slowly and has too few other characters to support his usual `` no acting is good acting '' method . Kevin , buddy , just for fun , put some emotion in your character the next time.I 'm no psychologist , so I really do n't know the professional theory on whether it 's men or women who hold grudges longer . I think everyone will agree no one can hold a grudge longer than a teenage girl , but I 'm talking about grown men and women , and their relationships with each other . However , talking about forgiveness , there is a really nice moment of forgiveness between two men in this film . Like I 've said before , you love those moments in movies when your heart stops , just slightly . This is one such moment , even if every other moment stinks , this one is good.For those of you reaching , hoping for something to love , you can love Paul Newman . He is the only reason to watch the movie , if you really feel you have to . He plays , Dodge , Garet 's grumpy , surly father . You may be pleasantly reminded of the old codger in your life . So , it 's kind of fun to watch movie characters who remind you of someone you already know . His role , though small , is practically the only redeeming part of this film . There 's not much more I can say regarding plot , what little there is anyway , without spoiling the movie . I think this movie was supposed to be a chick flick , but , being a chick , I could hardly stand it . There is n't one shred of testosterone in this movie , so for those of you who enjoy a healthy dose of that , you 've been duped . The whole movie could have been avoided if , instead of retreiving the message , the character of Theresa watches Martha Stewart and turns the bottle into a fabulous Christmas gift . Or maybe she could skip the creative stuff and just put some liquor in there and drink herself into a stupor instead . The plot moves along at a snail 's pace and Robin Wright Penn and Kevin Costner deliver subpar performances . If I could put a message in a bottle about this movie : Forget It !	-1
In Hollywood , anything worth doing is worth doing twice . In other words : Remakes that nobody asked for.In this case , it 's a remake of `` House on Haunted Hill , '' a classic Vincent Price thriller where you ca n't tell where the humans leave off and the ghosts begin . But the remake has not a shadow of the nasty charm , and so it merely trots out the gore and bad CGI to fill up the time.An oddball millionaire ( Geoffrey Rush ) invites several people to an old lunatic asylum , which is said to be haunted -- if they make it through the night , they will each receive a million dollars . They think it 's an easy way to make fast cash , and that the gruesome stories of torture and death are just to mess with their heads.But , of course , ghoulies and ghosties and things that go bump in the night begin to surface , and the guests start to suspect that they may not survive until morning . Especially since the millionaire and his cunning wife ( Famke Janssen ) may have murder on their minds . Will anyone escape the house alive ? When the original movie starred Vincent Price , it 's pretty hard to compete . So `` House on Haunted Hill '' simply does n't try . In fact , it goes in the opposite direction -- it becomes so amazingly bad and cliched that it 's actually kind of fun to watch , in a morbid way . It 's so over-the-top that it becomes a parody of itself.The problem is that `` House on Haunted Hill '' tries SO , SO hard to scare viewers , they overshoot the mark by miles . The writers and director trot out every loathsome visual and horrific bit of history , and jam it up in the viewers ' faces . Buckets of gore , deformed faces , atrociously phony CGI , and lots of bad scripting.Most of the cast is utterly forgettable . They yell , they curse , and they get photogenically filthy , and most of them die . And before they die , they stand around shrieking about the bad situation they 're in . `` The house does n't care what 's fair , who lives or dies . Know why ? Cause it 's a f**king HOUSE ! '' one of them wails . A real pearl of wisdom.The only saving graces are Rush ( as a Vincent Price homage ) and Janssen , who have a creepy kind of chemistry , and all the best lines ( `` ever since I first laid eyes on you , I have always loved ... your money '' ) . Rush gets a bit hammy in some scenes , like the bulletproof vest scene , but at least you can remember his name . `` House on Haunted Hill '' is not just bad compared to the original movie -- it 's bad on its own merits ( or lack of them ) . It does n't just fulfil the cliches -- it wallows in them , and invites you to do the same . Funny in its badness .	-1
Quite a tedious movie I must say . For fans of horror this film fails to show anything truly scary . Chris Kattan displayed some terrific acting though . But the whole idea was it to be scary and it failed to do that for me .	-1
No sex , horror , scary moments . This must be one of the fake scary movies PLEASE do NOT buy SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY .	-1
Making a good haunted house film is very difficult . For me , at least , it is very difficult since I compare everyone I see to the classic The Innocents . The newly updated version of House on Haunted Hill is no classic.My main problem with this film is that it is too unpredictable ! I know , I know , that sounds crazy , right ? Is n't what is wrong with films today is that they are all carbon copies and you already know the plot as soon as you sit down ? Yes , but in this film they go the opposite direction to an extreme . The plot is constantly changing back and forth , back and forth . There are twists every two minutes , and after awhile they lose their effect and become annoying . I wanted some good old fashioned scares , and all I got was an excercise in plot twists . Needless to say , I was not amused.All the performaces are stoic and not very entertaining at all . Geoffery Rush , what were you thinking ? This film ends up being like a good carnival haunted house . You are moderately entertained , never scared , and at the end of the ride you ca n't wait to get off .	-1
House on Haunted Hill is a terrible movie . It starts out like a moderately decent remake of the original , but about twenty minutes into it , things go out the window . After a creepy opening scene , the plot goes out the window in favor of meaningless shocks and laughable fx . Just when one thinks this joke of a horror movie ca n't get any worse , it does , with a poorly animated 'ghost cloud ' thats presence goes unexplained and its defeat comes effortlessly and questionably.With the exception of Geoffrey Rush 's wonderful performance as Mr. Price , House on Haunted Hill is a joke , a great cast ( Famke Jannsen , Jeffrey Combs and Peter Gallagher ) ca n't save the remaining untalented hacks , the fx laughable and the plot-nonexistant . Do yourself a favor and buy the 1958 version with Vinent Price and leave this turkey to the brain damaged teenagers who think that Urban Legend is also a good movie .	-1
I felt that this film did n't have any original scares and surprises . The film starts out in the one and only scary scene where a group of doctors are performing an autopsy on some one who is still alive in an insane asylum . Then the inmates break loose and kill the doctors and are killed as well in a fire . After some years later Geoffrey Rush and wife Femke Janssen invite 6 people to the now converted asylum for a night of terror in which if the participants live through the night they each win 1 million dollars . You can guess where it goes from there people die and lots of needless gore . Through out the film as I watched it I found that a lot of the scares were taken from other movies such as the ghost man that shakes his head was taken from Jacob 's Ladder . This was another Hollywood remake that should have never been made . The original was far scarier and who does n't love Vincent Price . If you can avoid this film like the plague do it its not worth the time or the money to rent . If you want good horror see something like Jacob 's Ladder where the scares are constant and is also a moving film .	-1
I rented this film and I was very very very much disappointed in it . First of all , the plot was just plain stupid and the acting , ugh , the acting was frightning . I thought the movie was supposed to be that but no . It turns out that House on Haunted Hill is a frivolous 1hr and 30min mess that sould of never been put out again . If you want to laugh really hard then buy it . It 's not my money . If you want to be thrilled or scared out of your witts then buy something else because House on Haunted Hill just does n't cut it . . .at all . It blends comedy , horror ( ha ha ) , and unnecsessary nudity ! COME ON !	-1
In 10 words or less , this movie was terrible ! I mean it had no real plot and just kept dragging on and on . If you 've ever seen a horror film in your life , you 'll predict everything that 's going to happen . The only thing I was surprised about was how the final & quot ; evil & quot ; would look , but other than that , it was totally not scary . The movie basically begged you to turn it off & quot ; End me ... End me ! For God 's sake , end me ! & quot ; I would n't recommend watching this movie or think about watching it unless you need a cure for insomnia .	-1
Normally , I do n't give animated movies one star . But this movie is just so worst case scenario that I ca n't help but utterly destroy it . I know I 'm going to get lynched by Pokemon fans for this , but let 's face it . This movie stinks ! No , I 'm not the kind of person who thinks Pokemon are creations of the devil or whatever nonsense they 're saying these days . I like the cartoon . I find it charming . Unfortunately , some things should just stay as a cartoon series . The animation style of the series is so wretched that it could n't possibly look good in a full blown movie . Pikachu 's Vacation is cute , but it 's incomprehensible and horridly strange . The main movie itself is slow , boring , and inane . It also rudely jackhammers its message into your poor brain . The soundtrack ? Dumb . More excuses to show off pop sensations . All in all , I really do n't care if this movie is entertaining to Pokemon fans . That 's not enough for me or for those who are n't . As a movie , this is one of the worst . It just shows such a complete lack of any creative thought one would expect from proper storytelling . Get far away from this monster and do n't look back .	-1
I 'll keep it simple . Do n't waste your time . This was the worst movie that it has ever been my displeasure to view in a theater . By the end of the show I wanted to strangle whoever it was banging on that [ ... ] piano ! If someone other than Kubrick had done it would have went the straight to video route .	-1
The movie begins earnestly enough , with the story of a marriage in serious trouble . Doctor Tom Cruise flirts shamelessly with two young models while wife Nicole Kidman exchanges innuendo with a suave older gentleman at a swanky dinner party . What follows over the next two plus hours is a movie which takes a surreal look at the decay of a relationship and the drives of the man and woman involved.While not without it 's entertaining moments , & quot ; Eyes Wide Shut & quot ; is a meandering film which loses it 's audience as quickly as it intrigues it.Ultimately , the movie 's slow pacing lingers far too long on an extended subplot involving a bizarre , ritualistic sex cult.Unfortunately , director Stanley Kubrick passed away prior to the completion of this film . What remained of his final vision for this movie is debatable , but for the casual viewer , & quot ; Eyes Wide Shut & quot ; will likely prove to be a confusing piece with marginal entertainment value .	-1
An overrated movie from an overpraised director . Still , it 's sad that the man behind Dr. Strangelove finished his life and career on this low note . What is the point of this movie ? Is Kubrick exploring the psycho-social ramifications of orgiastic sex ? Is it a statement on the subterranean mores of cosmopolitan wives ? Is it a warning that a dangerous cabal controls the sexual topography ? Is Kubrick enjoying a private joke at the expense of Tom and Nicole 's acting abilities ? Even the film 's ardent admirers ca n't say . But why should we fault them ? Kubrick himself seemed confused . If you are someone who likes to see some examination of virtue ( as well as decent acting ) in a drama , you will find very little of value in Eyes Wide Shut .	-1
Is this the artiest porn film ever ? A commentary on the opti-centric male brain ? The sexual revolution seen retrospectively through a fin-de-siecle Viennese novella ? I saw `` Eyes Wide Shut '' in its theatrical release and pretty much hated it . The dialogue is made up mostly of banalities which harkened back to the intentionally non-informational dialogue of `` 2001 '' ( but in that film it a point was being made about man 's misuse of tools in general ) . Also , I thought Kubrick 's direction of the actors in EWS terrible : everyone speaks with tremendous pauses , as if every line were fraught with gravity ( which of course jars against the aforementioned banality of what they are actually saying ) . I left thinking `` so what ? '' which is not something I 've ever associated with Stanley Kubrick ... I recently saw it again , and maybe I was a bit tough on Kubrick the first time around ( hence bumped up from one star to two ) . After my redux , there seemed nothing unnatural about the dialogue 's pacing -- given the weight of the events which happen to Dr. Hartford , whether they are inner fantasies or actually happen to him over such a short period of `` real '' time . The film is beautiful visually , no doubt about it , and you can see the meticulous care of every detail in the framing . And his taste for repeatedly using the same piece of music is here , but with increasingly annoying effect.This is the kind of movie it takes multiple viewings to fully understand ( if one can stomach the way Kubrick deliberately made it ) and it 's probably not worth the investment . It would have been transgressive -- had this film been released in the 60s or 70s , say . But 1999 ? It 's like an obsolete and dusty treatise discovered after a revolution has completely transformed a society . I think it would have been a far more powerful film if Kubrick had n't chosen to digitally obscure the orgiasts ( at the least ) or made the orgy scene truly shocking , unlike anything we 've ever seen before , filling Hartford -- and the audience -- with a sense of immediate horror and danger , instead of the trick of his being `` threatened '' with physical harm by the revelers . But Kubrick was going for something more subtle than that , and in the absence of clarity lost his hold .	-1
In addition to the strange story line , this movie moved so slowly you could take naps periodically and never miss a thing . In addition , the music was extremely annoying and we had to turn it down several times to reduce the annoyance factor . We never finished watching it because it was just too boring .	-1
'Eyes Wide Shut ' was the final film of the legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick . Kubrick 's films probably have had greater disagreement among film lovers than any other movie maker in history . Just for that he deserves to be remembered . Those who love his works call him a genius , while those that hate his films call him a charlatan . Regardless of what people may think of him and his movies , it is no doubt that his films continue to fascinate the movie fanatics . 'Eyes Wide Shut ' is no exception , although this reviewer will sympathize with those do no like this film.Most of this movie is very difficult to watch . No doubt , Kubrick 's impeccable craft is still there . The lighting , editing , music and a creepy atmosphere stays throughout the film , as it does in many of his other films . What is horribly lacking in the movie is a screenplay , story , and most importantly , a point or moral . The screenplay is downright awful . I swear Tom Cruise repeats everything another character says to him . It is as though Cruise 's character is absolutely clueless and has ADD . It is as though the screenwriters could not find anything better to write . The story is a absolute mess . Each scene is drawn out three times longer than it should . There are long pauses in the conversations , even though the characters are talking about the most mundane things . Rumors exits that Kubrick was a control freak . These rumors might be right . He was so obsessed with photography and technique that he destroyed any kind of spontaneity . The plot of 'Eyes Wide Shut ' ? Tom Cruise walks around `` New York City '' all night long encountering one bizarre sexual encounter after another . Many of these scenes are embarrassing and painful to watch . None of these encounters seem to bring any kind of point , except things most people already know.Although this movie has many bad things going for it , other things stood out that saved the film from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Tom Cruise , Nicole Kidman , and Sydney Pollack do a fantastic job in their acting . Their performances are powerful and convincing , and salvage a badly written story . Stanley Kubrick once again shines in his directing , as the orgy scene and the `` billiard room talk '' are both hair-raising and brilliant film-making . In the end though , 'Eyes Wide Shut ' is pretty much a waste of time . Kubrick died before he finished editing the film , so maybe what we saw was n't what he really intended . Nonetheless , even if Kubrick had completed the movie before his death , I do n't see how the final product could have been any better .	-1
This is , by far , one of the most boring movies I have ever seen . Halfway through the movie , my friend had to exclaim & quot ; What is happening with this movie ? & quot ; I said maybe we can wait for another 15 minutes to see if Kubrick had enough heart to entertain . Well , we were wrong . Maybe orgies are his fantasies so he made it as a complex movie to fool anyone who is stupid enough to believe this is a form of art.Tom Cruise is good . Nicole is gorgeous but her acting ... .. ! To summarize my review , everything ... . in this movie !	-1
The movie is slow , plodding , glacial , superficial and dull.The celebrated `` orgy '' scene is cold and clinical at best.Cruise and Kidman are both quite wooden/flat in their roles.It just all goes on and on and on ad nauseum - with no point.Final note : WHY WHY WHY is it the only America is forced to watch a CENSORED version of Kubrick 's final film ? If the director 's original intent was to show explicit SEX during the film 's central set piece , WHY ca n't WE as Americans who are blessed with `` FREE SPEECH '' be allowed make up our own minds ? This is why the MPAA is totally OUT OF TOUCH with today 's culture and sensiblities - they should definitely re-release this on DVD so at least we can finally see the `` naughty bits '' !	-1
Just about every director produces a turkey at least once in his career , even near geniuses like Hitchcock , but this thing was Kubrick 's last movie and that makes it very sad . Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play a husband and wife who seem to have gotten bored with one another but their on screen chemistry was so non existent the viewer was left wondering when these two characters had ever been in love in the first place.Nicole 's character informs her husband that she had an elaborate erotic fantasy about another man . Tom 's character , Dr. Bill reacts like a 15 year old boy instead of a sophisticated man . He spends the rest of the movie looking to get even and blunders into one sexually charged situation after another . None of these situations is ever carried to fruition and the most famous scene of the movie -- -the orgy turns dangerous for him.Now about that orgy scene . Why did all the women look like starved horses ? Perhaps it was Kubrick 's little joke but all the female orgy attendees reminded me of the dead woman in the bath tub from The Shining . Has an orgy seemed ever been filmed in a more unerottic way ? Dr. Bill does n't seemed shocked , amused or even excited so much as analytical . The whole scene , and indeed most of the movie seemed cold and silly in turns.There are two really good scenes and that 's it . The first is when the gossipy desk clerk falls for Dr. Bill 's charms and tells all about the strange men who took the doctor 's musician friend away and the second is when a hard looking man follows Dr. Bill throughout a remarkably empty and sanitized looking New York street.By the time the movie ends I did n't care about silly Dr. Bill or his frosty wife or their marriage or even what he was going to do about the possibly criminal aftermath of the orgy . As much as I loved Kubrick 's work and as much as I 'd like to say otherwise , Eyes Wide Shut stinks .	-1
Years had elapsed between one of his films and the next , yet to all , even his detractors , a new Stanley Kubrick picture was always anevent . Perhaps the most intriguing of directors , his films were so fewand far between because Kubrick , unlike every living filmmaker , had toinvent a new language with which to tell his bold , perplexing andalways rewarding stories . Few people agree on the merits of hisfilms . Yet , as I dislike some of his work , I can understand people 's appreciation of it.What a shame it is then to see Kubrick 's Eyes Wide Shut . Abloodless , joyless and yes , shallow whimper of an exit . The reviewsfor the film have a morbid fascination all their own , theysystematically and often passionately analyse and search for meaningfor what is essentially eye candy . These reviews say more about thereviewers then they do about the film . Kubrick 's weighty name hasprompted film lovers to offer explanations , excuses and delusionsabout the undoubtedly profound journey of one Dr. Bill Hartford ( TomCruise ) , who after hearing his wife 's all to brief confession tofantasising about another man , goes on an all night odyssey to regainhis sexual prowess . The meaning of life must be in there somewhere . Onthe face of it , a film that inspires this much reflection , even if itis for the wrong reason , can only be a good thing . Then again , applythat level of sincere analysis to a soft-core cable show , and theresults will perhaps yield greater insight.But Eyes Wide Shut istoo lifeless to be compared to soft-core , although the dialogue isoften reminiscent of those embarrassing late night excuses for ashag . Dr. Bill 's bizarre habit of repeating the last sentence saidto him in almost all his conversations aside ( my guess is that thecharacter is supposed to be a little dim or perhaps untainted by thepolitics of life ) , the character is about as human as you can get in aKubrick film , which puts him a few notches below Hal from 2001 . It istempting to blame the stars , who often resort to furiously rubbingtheir temples to suggest inner-conflict , but that would be unfair . Inthe brief documentary that follows the film , Kidman says that Kubricklet the actors try as many things as they liked before both , theactors and Kubrick jointly , decided which take to print . Try as theymight , with this strangulate script and this fatal precision , theresimply is nothing there.Eyes Wide Shut is not without merit . Thefilm 's washed out colours , the elegant tracking shots , the patientmise-en-scene , the incendiary and brilliant use of music promise greatmystery , a foreboding malice . An absorbing prevarication that flirtswith the border that seperates dreams and nightmares , but is undone , at a snail 's pace with a plot that can only be calledpreposterous . The disappointment is not unlike that of RidleyScott 's The Duellists , a striking film whose aesthetic richnesssimilarly proved to be a glossy ribbon around nothing . In a film aslacking as this one obviously is , the presence of good scenes likeKidman 's confession and the grandiose orgy sequence ( censored inthe US version ) are a juxtaposition to its shortcomings . A good storytouts and justifies the style in which it is told , a bad one hidesbehind it . Kubrick , once the inventor of filmic language has regressedinto the age old story of insecurity of two married hollowmasses . Consequently , Eyes Wide Shut is a dramatic , artistic andemotional dead zone .	-1
Stanley Kubrick 's & quot ; Eyes Wide Shut & quot ; is a disaster but one that only it 's legendary director could have made . I was intrigued when I found out that Kubrick had used Schnitzler 's & quot ; A Dream Story & quot ; for his source material . In this short story , Schnitzler very gracefully orchestrates a journey between the conscious world of a successful doctor ( Fridolin ) and the dream-like world he moves into during his nighttime odyssey . There his combined feelings of sexual jealousy and sexual terror lead him to imagine ( or to overreact to ) a menacing masked ball that he 's secretly gained entrance to.What 's wonderful about the Schnitzler story is that it has the pull and logic of a dream - situations are not resolvable or explicable and yet the action is guided by some unknowable force . It 's a delicately etched mystery ( what happens to the costumer 's daughter ? who are the masked ball partipants ? who is the dead girl ? ) that Schnitzler conjures and dispels without tying up loose ends . Much like the & quot ; Nighttown & quot ; chapter in Ulysses , the characters that Fridolin encounter seem as much as projection of his subconscious fears and desire as they do actual people.Very few directors have ever been able to successfully merge dream worldswith the actual one and , sorry , Kubrick is n't one of them . & quot ; Eyes Wide Shut & quot ; does n't have the graceful lyricism of & quot ; Beauty and the Beast & quot ; nor the haunting starkness of & quot ; Persona & quot ; nor the surreal comic touches of & quot ; Belle de Jour & quot ; It is as stitled and unconvincing a film as & quot ; The Shining & quot ; and for much the same reasons . Since Kubrick keeps us at a clincal distance from his characters - especially the poorly conceived Tom Cruise doctor - the viewer can never really associate the nighttime odyssey with anything that 's supposed to be going on inside his head . And consequently , Cruise 's nighttime odyssey seems all too arbitrary - even the masked ball does n't make much sense - and , what is worse , even moralistic ( good sex is staying at home , bad sex is Satanic orgies ) . Worse still , Kubrick corrupts the mystery in Schnitzler 's novella - the costumer 's mysterious clients in Schnitzer become two Asian buffoons in & quot ; Eyes & quot ; , the fate of the pianist is explained in the movie and Kubrick links the woman in the morgue with the orgy ( never done in Schnitzler ) . For a film that wants to put us in a dream world , Kubrick cancels out all the mystery that might have engaged us ( imagine , for instance , in the last scene , when Nicole tells Tom that there 's something they must do right away : how much more enticing it would have been if Kubrick cut to the credits before she gave her answer ) .Far worse than the material 's outdatedness is the fact that Kubrick , rather than accepting the challenge that it presented , subjected the story to the Full Kubrick Treatment . The visuals are superb and Kubrick handles the camera like a master but his Olympian approach to filmmaking is wholly inappropriate here . Those who like Kubrick 's work ( as I generally do ) probably see this as a masterpiece because he 's given his standard treatment to a wholly new subject matter ; I was rather hoping that & quot ; Eyes Wide Shut & quot ; would mark a departure for Kubrick , a recognition that not everything could be rationalized and explained under his critical gaze . Instead of appreciating Schintzler 's nuances and rhythms , he kills them and drains the life out of the story and & quot ; Eyes Wide Shut & quot ; consequently is like a beautiful corpse lying in the morgue .	-1
I think Kubrick was aiming for a Terry Gilliam style surrealism . I think . Whatever his goal , he seriously missed it . The dialogue is stilted and dull , the characters are 2D ( if that ) the plot bizarre and pointless , Cruise 's character is an oddly zombie-like Mr Perfect and we 're supposed to believe Nicole Kidman at her most stunning is a lonely housewife.I 'm a Kubrick fan , I loved & # 34 ; Dr Strangelove & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Lolita & # 34 ; and am totally fine with his more random and bizarre moviemaking moments . But this was n't bizarre . It was just lame .	-1
I hated this movie and am only giving it 2 stars because Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman acted well.The problem is it is poorly written and too far out there even for me ( and I like unusual , artistic flicks ) I do n't want to give away the plot - oh wait , there is n't one ! I guess the main reason I hated it was it was too long , too hard to follow , and just sickening.A man tries to prostitute his pre-teen daughter , and that is just one of the disturbing things in the movie.I 'm pretty open-minded , but they went just a little too far .	-1
I still ca n't believe that it took nearly TWO YEARS to film this lame art-nouveau piece . The plot is not cohesive , the acting is in slow-motion and the eroticism is vastly overhyped.Stay away . Check out any other Kubrick film first .	-1
The film opens with a ship on a foggy ocean . It is dedicated to the Free French who are fighting Germany . Next they show the Germans using the old audio device for detecting aircraft ( instead of radar ) . Bombs drop on a chemical factory . `` Till we meet again . '' A journalist from London , Mr. Manning , visits the Free French airbase . The Flying Fortresses are prepared for a night mission . [ Are those miniatures ? ] Captain Fressenay tells Manning about Matrac . This story starts on a tramp steamer where they talk about the Maginot Line . In the Caribbean they spot something , a small boat with exhausted men . Are they fugitives from Devil 's Island ? Or miners who want to return to France ? `` The man is insufferable . '' The Captain of the ship warns the men about their status . They tell him their stories . [ This pads out the film and provides personal backgrounds . ] Will the old man help them escape ? They tell about Matrac , a journalist who was against the Munich Agreement . Crowds attack his newspaper office while the police ignore this riot . Political oppression ? [ Do some of the scenes recall `` Casablanca '' ? ] Will Matrac be framed for a crime ? Will he survive in solitary ? The prisoners escape . But there are too many for the small boat . `` Good Luck . '' News tells of the fall of France . Captain Duval has taken command of the ship , he noticed the changed course . [ Never underestimate your enemy . ] This tramp steamer is armed with Lewis guns and a cannon . [ Protection against pirates ? ] Will a German bomber find their position ? `` Man the guns ! '' They fire a cannon at the bomber that returns fire . Then the bomber is hit and crashes . Matrac fires at the survivors to destroy them all . Captain Fressenay finishes the story and tells what happened after they reached England . One bomber has not returned with the others . When it lands there are casualties ; one does n't make it . There is an inspirational speech at the end.This is not a good story but reflects the thinking of many at that time . Was the death of Matrac done as a punishment ? Would any tramp steamer carry a cannon or even machine guns ?	-1
another wash out with Norma Shearer in the lead . Well , it 's not her fault . I 'm sure that many times I sound like a Shearer dissenter but here , again , she is woefully miscast and so is Leslie Howard . Both are too old for these romantic and classic roles . They do the best with a bad lot . Shakespeare and MGM should never have married , but here they have and this is what we get.An overplayed Shearer and a bored Howard . Production values are first rate but the glorious words of Shakespeare are lost on this duo . They try , and really make a valiant stab at it , but all for naught.The production qualites are excellent . And George Cukor directs the mess . Poor George.Norma really could n't play anything . Classic or modern , she 's the same in every film . And Juliet was far beyond her grasp , even though she tried like a sonofabitch to get through it . She does n't get through it at all . A lame attempt to keep a-going , keep a-going.Leslie Howard , wonderful in `` The Scarlet Pimpernell '' is lost here as well . Too gaunt and to fluty to really capture the character of Romeo . He tries , but the very fact that he tries is trying on the audience . He needs a vacation after the second scene but still manages to , somehow , make a valiant stab at it.If he makes a stab , then Norma Shearer is the one he stabs . She 's terrible as Juliet . Another vanity production for the untalented Shearer.For those who have asked , I do NOT hate Norma Shearer , but if she and Loretta Young and Ginger Rogers could win an Oscar , well , then anyone can . Meh .	-1
This cheaply-animated garbage is a cruel mockery of the beloved Batman we all grew up with.The backbrounds are cheaply animated , the characters are overly violent and overly dramatic nad there 's no plot whatsover.This is definately not a children 's show , and I doubt adults will be able to sit still through this disturbing cartoon.The whole '' Batman Beyond '' setries is a very disturbing cartoons-not even a psycho would be able to enjoy this series.If you want a GOOD Batman show , go with `` Batman & Robin '' or the original 60s Batman TV series .	-1
So the 2000 Batman Beyond film finally received an un-cut release . If you did n't enjoy the original cut , you 'll be surprised by the rather brutal flash-back scene . Other than that , Return of The Joker just an extended episode of a very poor animated series.The basic plot of BB : ROTJ is straight forward but cleverly inserts a twist but let 's get to most significant aspect of this film . The Joker has returned years after his death witnessed both by Batman and Batgirl ; However that night the was already marred with tragedy . The Joker weeks before managed to kidnap Robin ( Tim Drake by then ) and transformed him into his `` son '' completely devoid of sanity . This is where the film were was primarily censored in it 's initial release and needless to say , the uncut version is leagues ahead . The highlights includes an extension of Joker 's `` home movie '' of Robin being electrocuted and last but not least The Joker 's death when he is shot by Drake with a trick `` Bang flag '' gun loaded with a spear . The Joker 's final words were just mellifluous ; He spouts `` That 's not funny , that 's not ... '' before collapses to the ground . I can never get enough of this scene and truly mean it . Bruce Timm was always prevented to take The Joker under his true extremes because the restrictions imposed by network television , this is the shining moment of the character 's animated career.However , this film is just not par with this shining moment.Terry Mcginnis is a pretty dull character who 's personality can be summarized as `` teenager '' . You think Bruce , Barbra , and Tim Drake would be the main focus of this film but it 's not the case . They are virtually little more then plot devices to be used to just cover the back story ; You do n't feel any of their personal investment in this film and as result , you could care less about any protagonist in this film.Now I will admit I did like the fact that Tim Drake was ultimately exploited as the host body of Joker , hence the reason of Drake 's ordeal that fateful night . However that takes away a lot of the chutzpah of that great flashback scene . The Joker wanted little more than his own self-preservation and this all points to Bruce Timm 's Joker as a very flawed incarnation of the character . In Timm 's Joker episodes , excluding infamous `` Joker Fish '' , he has always been too logical and worst of all , obsessed with killing Batman . What makes the best incarnations of The Joker so endearing in the comics , especially by Stephen Steve Englehart , is that he is NEVER after anything that could make sense to anyone else or material gain . He also could have cared less about his own well-being which is what makes him so dangerous , he 's willing to loose it all just for that one sick `` laugh '' . Most importantly The Joker realizes that a world without Batman is no fun , as Joker once said in comics `` Who would I humble ? Mere Policemen ? '' . Granted , at the very least The Joker 's plot in ROTJ is ultimately chaos but where is his trademark panache ? A giant laser making a smile face ? Where is the sadism ? Where the dark humor ? It 's just not Joker , it 's just far too mundane unless you actually care about J 's targets that included everyone Terry cared about but I certainty did n't , not even Bruce who simply sat around during the whole movie.Overall , I 'd say this film is a miss . I 'd only recommend it for the flashback scene but to stomach the rest of the film would mean loosing the impact of it .	-1
terrible movieafter the doctor told the mafia boss not only where he 's going for vacation but also which hotel I knew this would be a bad movie -- insult to intelligence - cheap plot - yuyks .	-1
If you analyze this movie , you find the very stereotypical character played by De Niro , wasting his time doing God knows what . The psychiatrist played by Crystal spouts some Fruedian nonsense that is neither humorous , nor serious . At the movie progresses all actors seem to conspire to overplay their roles -- they almost compete against each other as to whose mannerisms will be more pronounced . The end is contrived , which is probably the logical conclusion for this lame movie . It symbolically self-destructs , having managed only a few laughs along the way .	-1
that Judy Garland did not appear in this film . After the phenomenal success of `` Easter Parade '' , the powers that be thought for certain ( rightly so ) that a follow-up pairing would be just as wonderful for the MGM coffers . For whatever reason ( s ) , Garland could not essay the role , so the powers that be felt that a reunion with Ginger Rogers would be right up Fred Astaire 's alley.So they hauled out and dried off Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire , under contract , had little say in the matter . He went along with it ; a company man.This film allows us the thrill and appreciation of enjoying the once-in-a-lifetime pairing of Garland and Astaire all the more . This `` reunion '' between Fred and Ginger falls flat . Very flat . In their RKO musicals they were elegance personified but here they are MGM 'd and Technicolored to the max and it 's garish . Not worthy of them . Certainly , by this time ( 1948/9 ) Rogers needed something - anything - to further her career and a `` reunion '' with Fred seemed like a sure bet.I think the film is dreadful and I 'm glad Garland did n't do it . Supposedly , a few songs had to be dropped as Rogers could n't do them . I 'll stick with `` Easter Parade '' .	-1
Boring movie . There was no action at all .	-1
To me it 's hard to believe that this simple and obvious film was endorsed by the master Oliver Stone himself . The film is not worthy of his reputation.And do n't stone me but Al Pacino is not the image of football coach . They have a certain personna and presence that Pacino just did n't embody in this film . Nor did any of the great NFL legends who appeared . Come on ... Johnny Unitas as a coach . Please . He , Jim Brown , LT ( who actually was perfect for this film ) , and Dick Butkus just did n't fit the mold . Are they all worthy of adoration certainly but from the film 's perspective they were out of place.The characters are n't sufficiently developed and the intensity is lacking not to mention the fact that the pace of the film and particular scenes moved entirely to rapidly . Too many images in too short of a period of time.A disappointing effort .	-1
Romeo Must Die was a let down . While entertaining to a degree , the movie suffered from the typical ridiculous plot ( most of which had nothing to do with 'Romeo & amp ; Juliet ' ) . Like most Hong Kong movies , the fights had alot of wires stunts . But with all the hype and money put into this movie , I was expecting better quality , not bad acting from Aaliyah , over the top computer graphic fight scenes and a terrible ghetto rap soundtrack . Skip this one .	-1
I like Jet Li but this movie is so faked it was impossible to get into the story . We are suppose to beleive this is the Bay Area of California but we see the Vancouver B.C . 's skyline , and locations and mountains , scene after scene , only the license plates and flags have been changed to protect the innocent . I just could not take any of it seriously . Lets have more truth in location . Pleeeease !	-1
FREEJACK is on my list of Top Ten Worst Movies I'v ever seen . I 've been seeing so many four- and five-star ratings for things on Amazon that I thought I 'd look p something truly horrific and see if people really had general bad taste.They do .	-1
The film 's message seems to be killing people is an acceptable `` lifestyle choice '' . Saving people from a violent death is worthwhle only if you love them and they love you otherwise ... it 's none of your business.Even Bruce Willis could n't save this turkey.This film went straight from my DVD player to the trash can .	-1
I felt like I was watching an extended sitcom and if that 's what you 're looking for , you 'll like this film . I wo n't belabor the film ; others have done that well enough . I 'll just concentrate on the DVD features . The DVD did n't have much in the way of extras . The interviews lasted less than 5 minutes per person . I did n't see a ` Gag reel ' . I must have missed it ? The trailer is just about standard now for DVDs . The commentary by the director was interesting , pointing out tidbits like when lines were improvisation . Overall , I did n't see anything that made me want this in my collection . I 'd say unless you loved the film I would n't bother .	-1
This movie is just awful . Matthew Perry is not an actor ; he plays the role of Matthew Perry . Rosanna Arquette has never shown herself to be more than a pretty face and her acting here was atrocious ... . the fake French accent was , to put it mildly , distracting.Several reviewers here have bored us recounting the movie `` storyline '' which I found weak and predictable . The characters are not credible and the movies ' dialogue should embarrass the film writers.The movie is billed as a comedy but I did n't get so much as a single chuckle.I find no redeeming value in this movie .	-1
Henri-Georges Clouzot 's `` Les Diaboliques '' -- or just `` Diabolique '' to American viewers -- is a classic suspense movie on par with Hitchcock . It 's a gritty , haunting story with an astounding twist at the end.So how did Hollywood ruin the remake ? Well , they decided to `` Basic Instinct '' it . In other words , they decided to remake it as yet another 1990s erotic thriller , and even cast Sharon Stone in one of the central roles . But the most unforgivable aspect of `` Diabolique '' is the drastic changes to the central plot -- which render most of the plot twists illogical and predictable.Vicious Guy Baran ( Chazz Palminteri ) runs a boarding school for boys , but the school is actually owned by his frail , pious wife Mia ( Isabel Adjani ) . Since he believes she will never divorce him , he has an open affair with one of the teachers , Nicole ( Stone ) . He does n't realize that the two women are secretly conspiring to kill him , and that Nicole has concocted a foolproof plan.So using the threat of a divorce , they lure him to a distant apartment owned by Nicole , drug him , and drown him in the bathtub . When they return to the school , they immediately sink him in a disgusting algae-filled swimming pool , having given themselves a pretty decent alibi . But when the pool is drained , the corpse is missing -- and someone sends pictures to Mia indicating that they were seen.It 's almost painful watching `` Diabolique '' at times , since it 's a perfect example of how most Hollywood remakes turn out -- crass attempts to `` modernize '' timeless material , with lackluster directors and actors attaching themselves to it . It 's pretty much impossible to not compare the remake to Clouzot 's original , and find it lacking in every way.It also has the pacing of a wet sandbag -- director Jeremiah S. Chechik tries to rack up the suspense , but instead we end up with a painfully slow movie about two women bickering . There are a few scenes that are genuinely suspenseful ( such as the police helping Nicole , with the corpse in the back ) , but most of the time it just feels like a slow trudge of `` clues '' that add up to nothing.And since it was the 1990s , Chechik also tried to make it more `` extreme '' than the original . The scene where the women drown Guy is unintentionally hilarious as he repeatedly bobs up and down in the tub , only to have them squash him back down again . And there is bucketloads of lesbian overtones ... no , the word `` overtones '' is too subtle for what is injected in here . It often feels like Nicole does n't want to rid herself of a troublesome lover , but wants to get rid of the competition for Mia.The plot is also drastically changed in several key ways , including the legendary twist ending . Unfortunately , this rips open a bunch of plot holes -- and oddly enough , rids the plot of all suspense . It 's incredibly easy to tell what the twist is , so when it happens it 's wildly anticlimactic.The one good thing about this movie is Isabel Adjani as Mia -- she has the pure , almost angelic appearance of a pious invalid , and she gives a lovely performance as someone tormented by her conscience . Compared to her , Stone seems cheap and wooden , and Palminteri chews scenery like a termite . However , Kathy Bates does give a nice performance as a jaunty female detective who begins sniffing around for Guy . `` Diabolique '' is indeed diabolical -- a slow , witless erotic thriller that fails to even be a decent suspense movie , let alone a good remake of a classic movie . The only good parts are Adjani and Bates .	-1
gritty , though it is , this movie is very boring . caine turns in an ok performance , but the only saving grace of the movie is some quite beautiful nude girls . other than that , nothing else worth mentioning . stick with the godfather if you want a good crime movie	-1
I 'm in England & although this is actually available from Warner UK as of today , I ordered this U.S blu-ray as it was slightly cheaper & I happened to be ordering a U.S DVD & so the postage cost was hardly any more . But to my regret ! In the opening scene where Carter is drinking scotch & watching a slide show , the two other men sitting in the room with him were completely voiced over by two stupid voices ! Unbelievable ! ! ! And for Warner of all people to mess the film up ! They even added some dialogue : `` Your brother 's dead and gone '' - that was not in the film ! ! ! They replaced another piece of dialogue with that . Caine 's dialogue remains the same . There are a couple of cockney expressions spoken in that scene which obviously Warner in the U.S decided that American viewers would not understand . But I think they would 've done and I 'm from South London , in fact a short distance away from where Sir Michael Caine was from ! How dare Warner tamper with this great British film ! I got a refund & I then ordered the [ region free ] blu-ray which Warner UK released here on Monday this week . But same problem ! ! Warner used the same master for both the U.S and UK blu-rays ! I mean , if Warner in the U.S think that American viewers wo n't understand our British lingo or expressions , bloodywell put optional sub-titles on the blu-ray , do n't ruin the audio track ! ! ! Disgraceful , shame on Warner ! Do n't buy this but wait until Warner have re-issued it in the CORRECT AUDIO ! As they did in the U.S with the DVD , they can always leave the silly dubbed track as an OPTIONAL EXTRA in case a viewer in the U.S really ca n't understand our cockney lingo but even so it 's highly unlikely as it 's not that hard to understand , by anyone who understands fluent English !	-1
The first Clint Eastwood film not to be given a cinema release and go straight-to-video in most overseas territories is a lightweight but amiable enough star vehicle that casts him as a skip tracer tracking down Bernadette Peters , who has skipped bail and headed for Reno in her recidivist husband 's pink Cadillac unaware that the boot contains $ 250,000 of his neo-Nazi friends ' money . The presence of the star 's green t-shirt and blue jeans outfit from Every Which Way But Loose clearly signposts it as one of his periodic redneck comedies , but unlike the superior Honkytonk Man and Bronco Billy , there 's no depth of feeling here . It 's all on the surface and ambles along predictably , but does n't really have an ending , with action scenes that are decidedly tame and lame and a main villain who 's decidely unthreatening ( for all their posturing , the bad guys do n't really do much more than waste their time on target practice ) .A more restrained Peters than we 're used to gives better than she gets from the script , but Clint is clearly having a whale of a time with a part that enables him to show a lot more range and extrovert good-humoured charm than much of the rest of his career put together . That said , some of his disguises are a bit hard to take - especially when he dons shades , spats , gold lame suit and Charlie Parker jive - although he does make a worryingly convincing inbred Southern gumby at one point . With the Malpaso stock company represented by Geoffrey Lewis ( as a spaced-out hippy that really should have been played by Dennis Hopper ) , Bill McKinney and Mara Corday and with bit parts from Jim Carrey as a casino entertainer and James Cromwell as a none-too-bright desk clerk , this is clearly one for the money rather than one from the heart . If the script could have done with a tune up and the film benefited from tighter direction and a little pruning , this still just about passes as pleasant enough Saturday night fare for all that , though chances are the only thing about it you 'll remember an hour later is the end title song .	-1
Okay , so you are in the mood for a `` Dirty Harry '' flick . which one to choose ? ? ? ? I 'll save you the trouble , and unless you 've already seen the other four `` Harry '' flicks , pick one of those instead . `` The Dead Pool '' is okay , but compared to what came before it in Clint Eastwood 's iconic series , it 's a huge letdown.The basic storyline is that someone is targeting local San Fran celebrities , and using a B-movie director 's Dead Pool list as targets . ( For those who do n't know what a Dead Pool is ; it 's when you take bets on which celebrities will pass away within a given time ) . Eastwood 's detective somehow makes the list of celebrities who may not survive the year.So this time around , Harry gets saddled with an Asian partner , and his love interest is a local journalist . Oh , and just to add to the mix , Harry has also been targeted by a local mafia boss . Sounds good right ? Well for the most part it 's not bad . I liked the idea of `` The Dead Pool Killer '' , and the cast is fantastic , with Patricia Clarkson playing the journalist who catches Clint 's eye , and Liam Neeson as a bad B-movie director . To top if off , if you 've ever wanted to see Jim Carrey die in a painful manner , then `` The Dead Pool '' will deliver , as Carrey does his best to channel every over-the-top 1980 's hair metal lead singer featured on Headbangers Ball.But right into the middle of this mix , someone dropped one huge of a turd of a car chase that blows everything that came before and after in the film . How bad could it be you ask ? Well , it 's a car chase between Clint 's Le Baron ( or whatever unremarkable 80 's sedan he was driving ) and a remote control car . Yes , a toy . I know you have to suspend belief when watching a `` Dirty Harry '' flick , but this pushed the limit of credibility right out the window and you can almost hear the film come to a screeching halt . It 's so genuinely awful , that it ruins what could have been a decent film.So unless , you just want to see the Swan Song of Dirty Harry as you 've watched the other films , or if you are morbidly curious to see Jim Carrey in a scene with Liam Neeson , then skip this lame entry in an otherwise great series .	-1
One man parks a van outside a country cabin . A stranger appears to kill them both ! He has emotional problems . There is a comic event in a restaurant . Then an `` all unit '' alarm for a liquor store robbery with hostages . [ Believable ? ] Will they get a car ? Yes , and Harry too . There is a big bill for damages ! Harry is transferred to Personnel . [ Was there an aptitude test ? ] the Mayor has new policies to implement . One candidate comes from Personnel and Resources . [ Experience ? ] She knows the law ! Some villains are planning a burglary to win arms and ammunition . [ `` Radicals '' have replaced organized crime as the villains du jour . ] These criminals leave one of their crew behind . `` It 's a war , is n't it ? '' Frank has a clue for Harry . There is a tape from the Revolutionaries . Harry is back on ` Homicide ' again , with a new partner . There is a demonstration of a Lawes rocket . [ Product placement ? ] Why does Harry lose his partners ? They witness an autopsy . `` Welcome to Homicide . '' They chase a suspect down empty streets , then to the rooftops to create action . [ Was a double used ? ] Does the use of a church show a hidden agenda ? Will Harry get info on Bobby Maxwell ? There is a police raid , Captain McKay makes a suggestion . Can you believe official news ? Harry does n't play the political game , and suffers for it . [ Was the Mayor of San Francisco as big a boob as shown here ? ] Is there a plan to attack the Mayor ? A tape is left in a phone booth . Captain McKay seeks Harry 's help , Harry seeks help from Mustafa . Harry looks for Wanda and gets a lead . [ Is there a political agenda in using that church ? ] Harry and Kate visit Alcatraz for a shoot-out . [ No back-up ? ] Kate rescues the Mayor , but suffers in the line of duty . Harry launches a rocket at the tower . Will he get a letter of recommendation ? A helicopter arrives with the ransom money , a nasty comment on civilian politicians.The story drags in spots and repeats cliches from earlier films , as if they are running out of ideas . It has a very cynical outlook that could be nihilistic . This film seems to lack the production values of earlier films . Were you happy when it was over ? This is more of a cartoon than earlier films .	-1
`` Dirty Harry '' was a gritty , brilliant suspense movie . `` Magnum Force '' was more of a Hollywood product , but still a solid timeless thriller.Sadly `` The Enforcer '' is the first misstep in the classic Dirty Harry series , skewing the series in all the wrong directions -- we 've got dated villains , a weird soundtrack , and an oddly defanged Harry dealing with TV-drama woes ( oh no , he 's got a WOMAN partner ! And she 's BY THE BOOK ! ) . Clint Eastwood is as cool as ever , but he seems to be sleepwalking through large portions of the story.After getting in trouble ( again ) for using excessive force , Harry ( Eastwood ) ends up exiled to the personnel department , where he 's forced to deal with inexperienced cops being made inspectors . But when his newest partner , Frank DiGiorgio ( John Mitchum ) , is fatally injured by an extremist group called the People 's Revolutionary Strike ( what ? ) , Harry is launched back into the fray.To his dismay , his new partner is Inspector Kate Moore ( Tyne Daly ) , who has never made an arrest or worked a real case . But because she 's a woman , the publicity-hungry mayor wants her on the case . And when a bomb is set off in the Hall of Justice , the uneasy partners are forced to go after the people responsible -- with shocking and tragic results . `` The Enforcer '' does n't really feel much like the previous two Dirty Harry movies . In fact , it sometimes feels more like an overlong episode of a '70s cop TV show -- just look at the whole subplot about Harry getting an `` odd couple '' partner who , of course , complements him well . And let 's face it , the whole revolutionary bomber thing has not aged well , nor are any of villains very memorable.And James Fargo does n't really inject much life into the lackluster story . There are some humorous moments that elicit laughter ( Freddie the Fainter ) , but the more script is n't as witty or tight as you would expect . And the action scenes are completely derailed by the soundtrack -- we get this weird cheery jazz music that sounds completely out of place . Whose idea was that ? That is n't to say that there are n't some powerful scenes -- there is a very intense scene when Harry speaks to a dying friend , and Eastwood pulls it off with a real sense of repressed rage and grief . But they 're too few and far between.Eastwood himself seems to be going through this one on autopilot , probably because Harry seems oddly defanged in this one . Oh , he 's still awesome and hard-boiled , but he just does n't seem as menacing or independent here . Tyne Daly does a pretty good job as Kate , though , and the inexperienced but brave cop does complement Eastwood 's hard-bitten Harry well . Too bad she did n't appear in any future movies . `` The Enforcer '' stumbles badly by having very little in common with the previous two Dirty Harry movies -- it feels strangely generic , as if it were a copy of a copy of a Clint Eastwood movie . Watch only if you want to see the complete series .	-1
Third Dirty Harry picture feels more dated than the previous two with its portrait of crazed radicals as the bad guys none of whom register as believable or menacing villains . The picture feels more like a violent TV episode from the era . Like in Magnum Force , Harry is made into more of a conventional cop hero than the extreme personality from the first ( and far and away best ) film . The whole show here is his relationship with Tyne Daly as his partner . These scenes are the best in the movie and both actors deliver .	-1

Not one of our favorite movies , acting was so-so and the movie was slow and really not our cup of tea .	-1
I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters way back . This movie always comes to mind whenever I think of the worst movies ever made . The worst scene is when he welds some 1/4 '' steel plate around the driver 's seat of a bus and drives through a gauntlet of cops shooting at him from roofs . He miraculously makes it through , walks up some stairs and decks a guy . Pretty silly .	-1
I enjoyed the movie when it first came out , but quit watching part way through remembering I did n't like the supporting actress who appeared in a lot of Eastwood films during the 70s and 80s .	-1
There are a lot of good Clint Eastwood movies out there , but this is not one of them . Instead , this is one of the weakest of his seventies crime drama movies , an ineptly written and generally boring movie.Eastwood plays Shockley , a Phoenix cop assigned to extradite a prostitute from Las Vegas . As a bit of silliness right off the bat , it turns out that there is even a wager at the sports books that he will not make it back to Phoenix alive . From that point on , the dumbness continues , with Shockley blindly going from one trap to another , hardly piecing anything together without being led by the hand . On the other hand , all the other cops are equally dumb , willing to shoot first and ask questions later.There are lots of bullets flying in this movie , but interestingly , Eastwood does not fire a single one at a person . Instead , he shoots doorknobs and motorcycles . Actually , Eastwood does n't get more than a few punches in ; those expecting Eastwood kicking butt will be sorely disappointed.This movie is strictly for Eastwood fans only ; all others should go elsewhere for a good crime movie .	-1
Heartbreak Ridge , 1987 filmThe story begins with newsreels of the war in Korea . There is a scene in a jail , a man is challenged and fights . `` This is your last chance . '' Gunnery sergeant Tom Highway had some problems in his past . He is sent to a new unit by bus . There are scenes that are not funny . NCOs must `` lead by example '' . Highway introduces himself to his men ; they are not enthusiastic . Highway meets an old friend in a bar . We see differences of opinion in this bar . Highway drills his men . Follow the leader . `` I never heard of that school . '' A jammed rifle ? Highway shows his leadership skills . There is a training exercise . The AK-47 has a distinctive sound . The Recon group plans an ambush . The Major objects to these tactics . Are the Recon troops trained for a real war ? A general arrives , like a deus ex machina . One soldier has a problem . Highway visits his ex-wife and talks . The story continues in a bar , then in jail . Later there is a parachute drop and a race to the top . Which group is the winner ? Will the Recon group testify against Highway ? No . A party is interrupted by a recall of soldiers . These Marines are sent to Granada , a small country in the Caribbean . There is little resistance at first . The Cubans resist , but are defeated . They arrive at a `` School of Medicine '' . Students are freed . Next they recon a hill . An armored car fires on them . Can a credit card bring help ? Helicopters arrive to knock out an armored car . Next they attack an old brick fort from the 18th century . `` Just enjoying the view . '' Back in the states there is a greeting for the returning troops.There were many better war movies in the 1940s and 1950s than this one . It seems to lack a unifying viewpoint . The island of Grenada had Cuban engineers to build a 7,000 foot airport , This would allow jumbo jets to land and bring tourists to Grenada , competition with other resorts.This invasion ended those plans . So what happened over the next thirty years ? This military action was famous for its ban on reporting by newspapermen .	-1
Now I see whyUnforgivenand the Eastwood work actor and director since is rightly considered such a renaissance . Heartbreak Ridge encapsluates every negative stereoype about Eastwood that saddled him before 1992 when Unforgiven arrivedEastwood acting is fine here as a hard boiled marine , but the writing is cliche , you could be watching a Chuck Norris flick . The serviceman encounters the hippy and the new gaurd officer , all with predicible sarcasim . So what.Eastwood had done far more nuanced work before -- Dirty Harry and a lot of the Leone westerns -- and it is disappointing to see the master working so far below his capacity.But also kind of fun . Seeing this now shows you how much Eastwood redefined homself in the 1990s , making morally complex films that define him as one of the best in cinema .	-1
Clint Eastwood is Gunnery Sergeant Highway , a Korea and Vietnam war veteran who survived a horrific battle in Korea referred to as Heartbreak Ridge and received the Medal of Honor for his actions . He 's a warrior on the battlefield , but his aggressive , hard-drinking , and frank attitude has cost him promotion and his marriage . Nearing retirement , he receives orders to return to his elite specialty of Force Reconnaissance . Upon arrival , the battalion 's operations officer treats Gunny as an outdated warrior , and he finds his new platoon comprised of misfits . He also learns that his ex-wife still resides locally earning a living as a cocktail waitress . Gunny commences to whipping his young Marines into shape while tangling with his ex-wife to repair their failed marriage . Meanwhile , Gunny is one step away from being under-mined and kicked out by his nemesis . The film culminates with Gunny 's Marine battalion deployed to intervene the crisis on the Island of Grenada ( actual operation in 1983 ) , with his reconnaissance platoon leading the way into combat . It is here where the plot unfolds to reveal if Gunny 's training has worked , and if his wife will return to him . The story is likable , but it suffers from immature male humor , and a lot of profanity . The feature has significant technical flaws such as an absence of other officers in the battalion , and Gunny 's dangerous training methods that would probably result in his being relieved from duty - not to mention a particularly disturbing scene during the Grenada operation when Gunny is portrayed killing a wounded enemy soldier . The movie is entertaining , but definitely not to be taken seriously .	-1
Ready to Rumble is not a good movie by any means . As a comedy the jokes are very sophmoric and the two leads give wrestling fans a bad name . However there are some redeeming factors that in some ways make this a better movie.The plot here is that the current King of Wrestling ( Oliver Platt ) is brutally dethroned by the an Evil promoter and his henchmen Diamond Dallas Page . From there two bumbling fans go on a quest to get Jimmy King back to the top . Along the way they encounter variouse WCW talent as well as other interesting characters.Easily the best moments come when either they show wrestling matches and when Marlon Brandow is on the screen . Yes Marlon Brandow is in this and is so over the top that in my opinion steals the show.However despite the cool wrestling moments and Marlon Brandow there really is n't much to look at here . The only thing worse than what this movie was a majority of the time was the fact that it spun off into a real WCW storyline that really sucked and made to some fans a hated man out of David Arquette . Past that if you really should , rent this ... or else I will lay the smackdown on you ... wait wrong promotion .	-1
God , this movie was ... .lame . I mean , it was lame . It limped ; it struggled , it staggered . I lost track of the cliches during the first five minutes . The really graphic sex scene that indicated the girl was gon na get killed ? Check . The sleazeball guy getting killed ? Check . The sleazeball guy practically begging for death ? `` Here , doggie ... '' ? That 's eighty minutes of my life I 'll never get back .	-1
I watched this because it was on a & # 34 ; top 10 & # 34 ; list of werewolf movies . What a mistake ! I think the writer/director had a hard on , not for Ms Hemmingway , but for the dog in this movie . The stupid movie is shot from the POV of a dog , and is so maudlin and emo that it induced nausea every time the dog is on screen.The special effects are decent and from a different perspective ( non-dog , more human ) this could have been a decent film , but as it stands , it is simply a movie directors love for a german shepard , put on film .	-1
Stay away from this awful movie . although Eastwood 's done a lot of great work in his 40 + years of filmaking , this is one movie to pass up . Donald Sutherland 's hippie character is a complete waste , while Carroll O'Conner 's character is simply a caricature of an inept army general . Eastwood does his wooden impression of a concerned soldier . Sadly , Savals and Rickles are the best actors in the whole movie . Poor attention to detail throughout : no one gets dirty or has a five o'clock shadow , despite marching through the French countryside for days . Also , after being strafed by an American plane , the soldiers call it the `` air force '' ( which did n't exist until after the war ) instread of `` air corps . '' No battle tactics displayed by the German soldiers who die by the score . Not one of them takes any cover or concealment . And were the Germans so deaf , dumb , and blind as to not see the Americans creeping up on them or their tank rumbling through town ? The final showdown between the German tank driver and the Americans ( Eastwood , Savalas , Sutherland ) is a poor joke , modeled on the man-with-no-name shootout scenes . They 'd been trying to kill each other for an hour and suddenly they and the German hatch a plot together to blow open the bank 's doors . Not even funny or in the least bit interesting . JUST AWFUL ! Stay away from it	-1
One great striptease scene , but even then you wo n't see any full flesh.Rent it if you have to watch do n't buy it .	-1
meaning it starts with what 's an extremely interesting plot , loaded with great possibilities , and instead of becoming a great film , sinks into illogical sludge . It 's a shame , too , because DePalma obviously has talent ... he just seems to lack follow-through . The ending is n't wry or clever or cinematic art -- it 's senseless and leaves the viewer feeling cheated .	-1
I loved the music but could n't stand the sex parts could n't keep watching it after about 20 minutes i just shut it off .	-1
This is one of the worst film 's to come out of that era . This film treats women like objects and not human beings with feelings and emotions . The film 's only point of view is from the perspective of John Travolta and if he can win the prize . And what is the prize ? Not clear ! That does not say much for the spirit of man .	-1
This 30th anniversary special edition might have been re-thought when John Travolta decided NOT to be in the documentary . There have been MUCH better retrospectives on TV . The small section on the Music which DOES feature recent interviews with Barry and Robin Gibb ... is okay but big time redundant ... and the BEHIND THE MUSIC on VH1 which was put in excerpt in the 25th Anniversary Edition would have been MUCH better than all the useless junk on this edition . This was an important ( I know that is an overused word ) movie for my generation ... with big themes of growing up , friendship , career , family , and moving out ... among others..and the special features of this edition reduce it all down to clothes and dance steps ... THOSE THINGS did n't make this movie important ... they missed the boat entirely.John Travolta is NOT in the bonus features ? Oscar nominated for his performance ... .he 's missing from this `` special '' edition..and for my money..if he 's not participating ... WHY make it ? and if I 'd known he was n't in this I would not have wasted my money ... the 25th Anniversay Edition is frankly ... much BETTER ! instead of the DELETED Scenes on the 25th Anniversary Edition we get dance lessons ? YIIIKES this stuff stinks ! the 25th Anniversary Editioncommentary , a very very good half hour behind the music documentary with interesting interviews and Travolta plus never before seen rehearsal footage , deleted scenesthe 30th Anniversary Editioncommentary ... no behind the music , no deleted scenes , no Travolta.no way ! !	-1
First off it was made by a Perv , Second it is creepy with everybody in on it type of thing , and it 's representative of the era and Hollywood 's Obsession with The Bizarre and Plain dumb . Masterpiece ? NO .	-1
Maybe I am just too young to get it , but it was not scary , not clever , and just not good.I watched the movie anticipating that it had to end well , but the ending made the movie worse.This is my first review . I just had to speak out against this movie .	-1
There is no doubt that Polanski is a brilliant film-maker : he is skilled at creating horror , particularly through suggestion ( there is very little graphic horror here ) . `` Rosemary 's Baby '' is suspenseful and scary throughout . Especially impressive is his ability to create unease and terror through some of the most ordinary , non-supernatural elements of the story , for instance , the isolation of a young woman from her peers.I must admit , however , that this was one of the most unpleasant and disturbing film experiences of my life . There was nothing entertaining here , only shocking and terrifying . For ultimately , Polanski 's seminal horror film signals a marked departure away from the redemptive themes of earlier films of the genre ; Polanksi 's vision is Christless , redemptionless and despairing , the ultimate expression of the `` death of God '' era to which the film occasionally refers . `` Rosemary 's Baby '' may be technically ingenious , but it it is finally bleak , hopeless and , as such , empty .	-1
I purchased this movie by mistake because I failed to recognize it . I had watched the beginning before , but soon abandoned it . I thoroughly dislike Italian westerns made in Spain , especially by Sergio Leone . Spain is not the American west , which is an interest in itself . The trains are European design and are badly phonied-up in a paltry attempt to make them look like 19th century American ttrains , as though no one would notice . Any substantrial buildings are nothing like what would be found in the U.S.A. Those westerns fall short because they fall apart .	-1
We thought this film would be great with big name stars and good reviews . It started well with wonderful photography and an interesting sound track but after about 15 or 20 minutes the really slow pace with lots of close ups of evil looking cowboys was just too much . The whole effect , while very arty just was a bit too s l o w for us . We quit at that point . Maybe it would have gotten better had we waited . The art of what we saw was very good .	-1
too many people gave positive reviews of this movie as did a few of my good friends . i was warned by one of my friends that it would be slow but worth it ... .no ! that is not this case . it was slow but it wasnt worth it . overrated movie big time . clint 's movies are classics , this was ... barely watchable ... and i only finished watching it because i spent 7 bucks on it .	-1
It starts out with a stranger rolling into town with 3 men waiting to kill him . NOBODY in this story knows who this guy is including the gang that killed him . Does that make sense to you ? That 's pretty much the way the whole movie is to me . A bunch of people talking to each other , fighting each other , then allying with each other , then fighting each other again . In this movie was some story about a railroader trying to gain control of a piece of land . I also found the harmonica music very annoying . Now , it may not help matters that I was doing other things while watching this movie , but still , I found the storyline very unorganized and confusing.Very long and drawn out .	-1
Read some good things about this movie , so I bought the DVD on a lark . $ 15 down the drain . Apart from the opening sequence , which showed some real promise , I ca n't understand how anyone could call this lumbering beast a great movie . Painfully slow , as it introduces the main characters with minimal dialog - a lot of people staring at one another . An undistinguished plot that is leisurely revealed , cumulating in a big nothing . Another cookie cutter storyline , the sort that put the western on life support before Clint and Costner made it respectable again . I never believed for a minute in any of these characters . ( *Spoilers* ) Charles Bronson 's motivation is not revealed until the end of the film , and it has nothing to do with the rest of the story . Tacked on justification for his inexplicable behavior . Jason Robarts ultra-lame death scene is laughable . Particularly after he must have been wounded for quite some time and gave no indication that he was injured in his previous scene . Henry Fonda is an effective bad guy , until he opened his mouth . His characteristic drawl is forever linked to the likes of ` On Golden Pond ' and ` Mister Roberts ' and no steely blue eyes or two day stubble can change that . The only high point is some interesting camera work . Unfortunately that is only one piece to a very incomplete puzzle . This film does not even belong on the same shelf with ` A Fistful of Dollars ' or ` The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly ' . I was wondering why I had never seen it before . Now I know .	-1
Plenty of good actors but weird imagery , bad acting , strange settings . Does not represent the true American West of the time .	-1
worst movie I have EVER seen . I only gave it one star because there is no zero . the actors are great , but the whole story could be told in 10 minutes . no one said more than a paragraph for every 30 minutes .	-1
not a good movie at all , slow and boringwould n't recommend this movie to anyone at6 all . They justkeep dragging it out	-1
Like most late Preminger ( the entertaining `` Advise and Consent '' the notable exception ) , this is a huge turgid bore . Not much well-staged action , certainly no memorable character moments . Even Jill Haworth 's suicide generates little audience shock or reaction simply because the surrounding characters do n't seem to give much of a damn ( Haworth 's death as Kitty in `` Exodus '' seemed much more affecting ) . Even the reliably terrific Jerry Goldsmith 's score is none too interesting , and Kirk Douglas , Patricia Neal and other stalwarts are wasted . Preminger 's reputation has diminished since his passing , perhaps because this oversized personality was always his own greatest hornblower .	-1
Ford gives his take on how law and order came to the western frontier and it is believable if you do n't know much history except what you have seen in Westerns . It may also be his answer to High Noon and the theme of one man having to take on outlaws without help from his friends and neighbors . A statehood issue is shoehorned onto this theme . John Wayne is in his usual western character and costume and James Stewart plays his usual B movie character ; both are too old for the parts they play ; but do give their usual very professional performance . The doctor and newspaperman , as in most westerns , are the town drunks . The plot and subplots are stale , the townspeople are stereotypical of early to mid-20th century westerns . Sadly one scene even confuses the Declaration of Independence with the U.S. Constitution . This movie is vastly over-rated by most reviewers on this site .	-1
`` El Dorado '' might more aptly be called `` El Gordos '' as the two stars are clearly over weight and out of shape in this 1967 Howard Hawks film . Or you might call it `` El Doublo '' since the film is clearly a remake of the far superior `` Rio Bravo '' ( 1959 ) that also starred Wayne and was produced/directed by Hawks and written by Leigh Brackett.In this film , Wayne plays a deputy sheriff to his old friend Robert Mitchum and he is assisted by a young man ( James Caan ) who is nick-named after a state ( Mississippi ) and a grouchy old man ( Arthur Hunnicutt ) . They are besieged in a small town jail because they hold land-grabbing Ed Asner who is responsible for ordering a man 's death . The gang is led by gunslinger Christopher George . Mitchum plays a drunk . There is a half hearted romance involving Charlene Holt.In Rio Bravo Dean Martin plays the drunk and the deputy and Wayne is now the sheriff . They are besieged in a small town because they are holding the brother ( Claude Akins ) for murdering a man . Akins is the brother of a land-grabbing rancher ( John Russel ) . Wayne and Martin are assisted by a grumpy old man ( Walter Brennan ) and a young man ( Ricky Nelson ) who is nick-named after a state ( Colorado ) . There is a half hearted romance involving Angie Dickinson.FWIW - Wayne wanted to play the Sheriff in `` El Dorado '' but Hawks wanted Mitchum.We think of Howard Hawks ( 1896-1977 ) as a Western director , but in truth , Hawks made all kinds of films , including comedies , gangster and war films . He was nominated 3 times for a DGA award for `` Red River '' ( 1948 ) , `` The Big Sky '' ( 1952 ) and `` Rio Bravo '' ( 1959 ) and he was Oscar nominated for `` Sergeant York '' ( 1941 ) . Among his other notable films were `` Scarface '' ( 1932 ) , `` The Big Sleep '' ( 1946 ) , and `` Gentlemen Prefer Blonds '' ( 1953 ) .Leigh Brackett ( 1915-78 ) was a science fiction writer who also worked on screenplays . She was nominated by WGA for her work on `` Star Wars V '' . She worked with Hawks on `` The Big Sleep '' , `` Rio Bravo '' , `` El Dorado '' , Rio Lobo '' , and `` Hatari '' . She said - `` When I write a novel I am God at my own typewriter and there is nobody in between . But when I write a screenplay it must be a compromise because there are so many elements which are outside the writer 's province . `` It 's hard to believe that Hawks and Wayne made `` Red River '' ( 1948 ) when you watch this film . There is very little in this film that will attract anyone . Christopher George is a villain only in name . We see nothing to convince us that he is dangerous , so when he is gunned down by a crippled Wayne falling out of a buck wagon , who cares ? And Ed Asner hardly evokes any fear or awe.In 1967 the top grossing films were `` The Jungle Book '' , `` The Graduate '' , `` Bonnie and Clyde '' , `` Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner '' , and `` The Dirty Dozen '' . Oscars went to `` In the Heat of the Night '' ( Picture , Actor ) , `` The Graduate '' ( Director ) , and `` Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner '' ( Actress ) . Other notable films that year were `` Bonnie and Clyde '' , `` Cool Hand Luke '' , `` Camelot '' , `` I am Curious Yellow '' , `` To Sir With Love '' , and `` Point Blank '' Westerns released in 1967 included `` A Fistful of Dollars '' , `` For a Few Dollars More '' , `` The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly '' , `` Hombre '' , `` Hour of the Gun '' , `` Welcome to Hard Times '' , and `` The War Wagon '' .Give this one a miss . Everyone has done much better in many other films , so why spend your time and energy on this one .	-1
I ordered El Dorado with John Wayne and as a Christmas gift for my Grandfather , but when he opened it , a completely different movie was inside ! Absolutely disappointing . I have no idea why this happened , but I know I will not order from this seller again .	-1
the writer of this movie is well known but this one is one of his bad stories . the only thing i enjoyed about this movie is how they showed how an aircraft carrier works . other than that the story sucks . the ending is awful . watch the movie & # 34 ; bataan & # 34 ; and you will see the comparison on how these movies compare .	-1
Too much unnecessary violence . Bloody gore , We do n't need this type of movie . I 'll pass on movies of this type which have no redeeming qualities .	-1
Charles Bronson is realistically nervous taking on NYC 's muggers , robbers and assailants after the murder of his wife , but what was once a shocking expose of big city crime and ruthlessness now merely looks ugly and sad , with only detective Vincent Gardenia 's pungent asides to give the film a little humanity . Bronson ca n't seem to go for a walk without a vicious thug picking him out , and while the film is n't very dated , it is over-the-top in its cheap nastiness . The brackish color and dawdling pace are other handicaps that make the whole queasy enterprise slightly stultifying .	-1
The big claim made for this movie is that it is realistic . That is the usual claim made for movies that have little else going for them . The definition of `` realistic '' relied on for such movies is : boring , dirty , and ends unhappily . ( That there are other aspects of reality does not seem to occur to them . ) So , all right , I give the movie a star for realism . I ca n't give it a star for `` gripping '' because it is n't . I ca n't give it a star for `` moving '' because it is n't . I ca n't give it stars for photography , music or acting because these are adequate but not outstanding.Even the `` realistic '' claim wo n't stand scrutiny . Are we supposed to believe that a seriously wounded man could walk through snow with no clothes on all the way back to the cabin ? Are we supposed to believe that these three stereotypical villains would wait two days for the lady to make up her mind ? Nonsense ! They 'd rape her then and there . Are we to believe that a real down-and-dirty cowpoke would turn down a beautiful woman ? This is n't realism . This is chivalry ! This is a Romantic Hero ! And of course , the biggest cliche of all : the cavalry riding to the rescue at precisely the right moment -- only in this case it is Will 's two friends who have ridden for days and just happen to show up at the precise second that he needs them ! The only reason to watch this film is to study it in contrast to Shane . After all , the movie strains to be another Shane . Why is n't it ? Why is Shane all of the above and more and this movie is n't ? Why do the characters in Shane stick in your mind the rest of your life and you ca n't remember most of the characters in this movie the next day and none of them the next year ?	-1
i read many of the previous reviews and could n't wait to see the mini series . what a let down . the entire cast need an electric probe in the rear . there is so little dialogue , & # 34 ; Pug & # 34 ; Henry , is so stiff and says hardly anything . they all claimed Ali McGraw was bad , but i think she had more spunk than the rest of the cast put together . i have only watched the first three DVD 's and it is so slow and boring it it not funny . The book is brillant , but this 14 hour serious lost the plot somewhere . i am so disappointed . i think most of the cast our out of their depth . Pug is meant to be shorter than his wife @ ! He towers over her . The two sons are so sullen and lack all animation . Never mind , those that like the series must see something i do not . Palmer Kirby and Rhoda are meant to be lovers ! what happened to all of that @	-1
45 years after a movie was released & the movie could n't be released in its ' original format ? ? ? what did they know in 1968 that the company that released this dvd does n't know today ? if you want the movie wait till they release it . the is the abridged version . 1 star dvd & 4 stars the movie	-1
This movie did not make any sense . Dean Martin singing in a western ? I did n't even finish watching the movie . At least have some interesting poker games .	-1
The DUKE must be rolling in his grave ! I rationalized that the quality could n't be THAT bad . Well . . . the other reviewers are RIGHT ! In some ways my DVD versions of these films are actually better . Believe it or not , I just tossed this `` BLU-RAY '' collection in the trash !	-1
I bought this box set of `` John Wayne Collection `` because ever since i was a small boy i have been a big fan of the Duke ( J.Wayne ) that most of his early films have never been seen in London , England ( Great Britan ) . so for many years they have been showing nearly the same films over and over again ( E.G Rio Bravo , The Alamo and True Grit ) .When i saw this box set i was very happy until now : 5 discs , early 1933 films ( great i thought , never seen them in my life ) And now that i am watching the first dvd while writing these words ... .. Here is what i am thinking What the hell was the company thinking of , this box set is cheap very bad picture quality so dark ... .. it 's like a bad vhs to vhs copy then transered to dvd , I can not see the actors.Let alone the scenery and even the sound is bad very low . please if you are interested in buying the collection stay away from the 5 pack ( madacy ) collection it 's so bad .	-1
One of my favorite movies of all time . I 've had it on VHS and was thrilled to get it on cd but the disc itself is bad and wo n't play.I '' ve purchased many other movies with no problems at all but not so much luck on this one .	-1
I was always certain that this movie was an action film , but really there is hardly any action in it . Despite an excellent cast , including some small roles for quite well-known actors , this film just did n't seem to work . I have n't watched it enough timesa to remember what it 's about , because it 's just too boring . Maybe , there are one or two small tense moments in the film , but not many . I thought the jump from the helicopter to the sumbmarine scene waas good and the last ten minutes were quite good , but I feel the action gets rushed.But , if you like submarine movies you will like this . And , if you like Connery you will like this , but the film just does n't work for me .	-1
Harrison Ford has been much better in other films . There 's not much going on here , really , but the Clear and Present Danger is even more important to consider now .	-1
This movie is the a bunch of junk . First William wallace was not a highlander most of the soldiers at striling were lowlanders and they would be simirally dressed like their english counterparts tough a little more poorly . The scottish aristocracy would be dressed like knights like englishmen . Many of the scottish nobles held lands on both sides since the arrival of norman knights to scotland on urging of the rulers there . There is no evidence that highland tartans ever existed . Edward longshank would not be afraid to fight wallace he was noted for his strength and bravey and always getting into the thick of the battle . The French princess would not be able to hide her thoughts by speaking French since that was the only langauge Longshank spoke , his mother was french he had lived in France and the English nobles still spoke French as there First language . William wallace was no fan of Robert The Bruce he was a supporter of John Bailliol , Bruce was n't a confused idealist he was a brutal ruler like mosts , and had even murdered another claimait to the thrown , and the highlaners were not that loyal to the scottish crown , some of them were still in allegiance to the king of Norway.the only good part of this movie was proably that sophie marceau was in it . All in All total junk .	-1
Who is William Wallace ? He is Scotlands National Hero , there is even a statue in his honor at the field of Stirling Bridge.This was one of the two most major engagemnts fought against the english in which William Wallace was commander of the forces of Scotlands army.The other major fight was at Falkirk which was a disservice to honor and glory and in truth was to allow for the subsequent martydom of William Wallace.In the film Braveheart , liberties are taken with history so that what we are asked to consider is in fact a motion picture and not an attempt to tell history with a historical purpose.I would recommend to anyone wishing to know better , to go to Scotlands national web site and there you will find a good deal of factual information about the life and history of both William Wallace and the nation of Scotland.It is of worth noting that the archives could not verify the claims made in this picture which sought to take the very heart out of the marraige vow , with an edict that allowed for the compelling motivation of war.In a manner of speaking this is very nearly baseless showboating and what makes this so very difficult to get out of the way of is that this is a very violent film with so much political rhetoric that the emotion just sort of grabs you , to me this is unfortunate.The film though is correct about a few things and that Wallace was betrayed at Falkirk by the underclass which ruled from behind closed doors.This underclass , if you will , is referred to , as the nobility.There ties where to there lands and titles which had been given to them by the Crown of England.They sought to protect there interests by betraying this very brave man in William Wallace.Though these are but a thousand words William Wallace deserves better and you will find honest information elsewhere.It may not be a popular opinion but to me Braveheart is a dishonest film and it does have the distinction of wining a best picture Oscar.However it will keep your attention and perhaps like it did to me , provide the reader with motivation to know who this William Wallace really is , and better yet you might be able to get out from under the problems mentioned and learn something about the politics of the silver screen.There are so many items that were this to be possible , you would find a different result if in fact the truth as to history and the truth as to Braveheart were written that what is perceived at present would differ considerably with what would be the truth .	-1
I do n't want to slam this movie , but I just do n't understand why so many people like goofy , cute stories like Forrest Gump . It was so far-fetched for me that I never watched it again . It was not quite as bad as The Terminal.Like the reviewer below me said , this movie beat out The Shawshank Redemption at the Oscars . Unbelievable .	-1
I could never understand why this film was and still is so popular.The story is not even that great.Some slow inbred southerner lives through different eras ... while playing college football , going to vietnam , saving his ungrateful lieutentant 's life , showing Lyndon Johnson his bullet wounded ass , falling in love with his whorish drug headed hippie girlfriend ... blah blah blah . Its just stupid . There are other Tom Hanks films out there , that are so much better , compared to this overhyped big waste of time.PHILADELPHIA , THE GREEN MILE and CASTAWAY ... just to name a few . Check out Hanks ' other movies and do n't bother with this boring piece of crap .	-1
Particularly memorable idiocy from this abysmal sequel to `` Escape From New York '' includes : belligerent feds mocking Snake with `` do our mission or else '' disguised as holograms cuz `` did you really expect us to be that stupid ... muahaha '' , Snake spontaneously surfing alongside a beach-combing Peter Fonda in front of a cheesy green-screen tidal wave , a life or death coliseum-style game of basketball free-throws , a goofball third-world dictator leader of L.A. and his ride pimped out with doll heads , some of the worst CG ever captured on film , Stacy Keach 's hairpiece , every time Steve Buscemi appears onscreen , the not-so-breathtaking hang-glider attack on the dictator 's compound sequence , a guided missile that only wipes out passengers in the back-seat of Snake 's escape helicopter ( who were those people ! ? ) , a supposedly mega-sophisticated piece of tech on which the fate of the free world hangs in the balance that looks like a Pez dispenser , a film score that sounds like a collection of generic .wav files somebody downloaded from the internet ... . for free , and finally the ending itself ( would n't wan na spoil that ) .I felt really bad for Kurt Russell as I watched this . : (	-1
Barely a plot and when it occurs , it 's full of holes . The 1 star reviews here point them out . Kurt ranges around the film as anxious husband and a cat with 9 lives who escapes about dozen ways to get himself killed . No character development outside of looking anxious . The hilly-billies of Bracket are dead pan or corney . This film is looking for any and every way to squeeze action out of itself . Must be an action film then .	-1
This film is reminiscent of 'The Silence Of The Lambs ' and 'Seven ' , both much better films . The editing , narrative style , atmosphere and screenlay are all handled wronly . The only good thing are the commanding performances by Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman . Formulaic , tedious and overlong . Could of been better , but the ending really brings it down , it seems dumb and out of place . From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 5 !	-1
Nothing very original here , I 'm afraid ; it 's a potpourri of themes taken from a dozen or more psycho-thriller dramas that 's preceded this -- The Collector , Dirty Harry , Silence of the Lambs et al . I recommend 'The Collector ' made in 1965 directed by William Wyler as an absolute standout classic film in this genre . See this film , it will truly chill and shock you without the cliched Hollywood gimmicks that are so de rigueur today . I agree with other critics ' comments about this film being 'hackneyed ' and deja vu .	-1
althought it is a great movie and i would love to see it again i have a blu ray player , updated and one of the newest ones and the bad thing is that the player does n't read the disc ! i do n't know why , so i have it there but ca n't see it .	-1
Do n't need to review the movie itself : if you are a fan of `` Grease , '' you do n't need to be sold on its pleasures . The Blu-ray `` Rockin ' Rydell Edition , '' however , requires some comment.The overall picture is very good : colors are sharp , not overly saturated , good detail . No complaints -- the video transfer is pleasing.The AUDIO , on the other hand , is awful . The soundtrack musical numbers are clear and actually improved upon in 5.1 surround . But the dialog track is astonishingly muddy . There is a noticeable difference between the audio quality of the dialog and that of the musical numbers . I thought it was just my imagination until , after viewing , my wife made a comment about how hard it was to hear the dialog . This was a major disappointment , and for that reason , I would not recommend the Blu-ray edition.Have n't watched all of the extras yet , but they are as expected , fun but nothing you probably did n't already know if you are a fan of the film .	-1
Considered one of the greatest musicals out there , this film adaptation of the smash hit play , & quot ; Grease & quot ; , has today become a classic . But not for me . While the songs are exciting and fit for a party , their old-fashioned , 50 's style of tune makes them real annoying ! Well , what 's the story . I must say that it 's nothing , except the story of two teenagers , whose life stories their senior high school are told through rock 'n ' roll music . Actors are mediocre , John Travolta stunk . So if you enjoy musicals , this one 's for you . But , if you are easily annoyed , watch something else .	-1
I 've been waiting years for this DVD , so I bought it the first day of release . The wrapper promised high quality Digital Remastered image . What went wrong ? They apparently did n't think to clean the film of dust ( there are some real whoppers that flash by ) , and spots reveal that the lenses were dirty as well . I 've got DVDs of 1930 's movies that look better than this . Shame on Paramount ! Rent this before you buy , check it out , and see if you really want to reward them .	-1
Yes , I watch this film religiously , each time in the hope that our Leo lets Ms Winslett drop to her watery doom . Want another reason for just the 1 star ? Celine Dion .	-1
If ever there was a film which should have been whittled down to a 25 minute all action/no nonsense cut , it 's Titanic . As for the remaining 2 and a half hours , well , those reels should have been stored on the mother of all boats , and set on a collision course with the nearest sizable iceberg ...	-1
Instead of sitting through Titanic , I could have done something productive like watch grass grow , watch paint dry , or just sit in a pitch black room and stare at the wall . The plot drags , much of the acting is terrible , and before it even begins ... WE ALL KNOW HOW IT ENDS ! There are still people who are surprised ! What did they expect ? The ship hits the iceberg , then magically sprouts wings and flies away ? Of course it sinks ... of course DiCaprio dies . In fact , that and Kate Winslet 's artistic nudity are the only two things that make this drivel even remotely watchable.If no stars was an option , I 'd click it .	-1
this movie is ssso disterbing , i mean 1 star is too much for a movie like this . it does'nt worth a half star or even half the half star , i mean common it 's so very BAAAAAAD ... ... see ya .	-1
While this movie will never replace & quot ; Santa Claus Conquers the Martians & quot ; or & quot ; Plan Nine From Outer Space & quot ; as the worst Hollywoodmovie of all times , it certainly ranks as one of the most BORING.Director James Cameron 's target audience is obviously 11-16 year old American girls . If you have anything more sophisticated than they do going on in your head , there is not much for you here besides dazzling special effects . I say this because the love story which forms the sole raison d'etre for this movie is as hackneyed and cliched as can be . Hollywood has done variations on this theme of & quot ; doomed love & quot ; dozens of times throughout the 30 's , 40 's and 50 's , and done it better . Everything about this movie , the size of the cast , the special effects and wardrobe budgets , is HUGE , but , ultimately , empty.Cameron should have cut the size of his cast in half and invested the money in a better script.There is only one fully-developed character in the whole film , and that is the character of Rose , played by Kate Winslett . Rose is an anachronism , a 1990 's American feminist in Edwardiantimes , trapped in an arranged engagement for money . Anyone whohas read their Henry James is familiar with this scenario . They are also aware of the subtle and obvious differences in attitudes between the women actually in these circumstances at that time and the attitudes of Rose . By making all the other characters in the drama , even Leo DiCaprio 's Jack Dawson , two-dimensional at best , whatever conflict that could develop in the plot lapses into a morass of cliches that you 've seen a dozen or more times before . When the self-centered fiance and his evil , toady butler meet their fates , your reaction is not : & quot ; Good ! & quot ; but & quot ; So what ? ! & quot ; The problem with a one character-driven plotline , is that the audience does n't care one way or the other about any of the other characters , so what happens to them is unimportant . If you find the central character to be totally implausible or ridiculous , there 's nothing to hold your interest in the story . This flaw is compounded by the fact that we know in the first 10 minutes of the movie that Rose survives the Titanic and Jack does not . Therefore , the only real suspense generated by the film is : & quot ; When will it be over ? & quot ; Just as annoying is the way Cameron treats all the really interesting themes which could have made this story interesting , the arrogance of wealth , the hubris of technology , the corruption and greed of vain ambition , as mere peripheral ornaments . Everytime Cameron 's camera finds something of interest to focus on , it cuts away . & quot ; Okay , we 've shown you that , now back to our love story ! & quot ; The conflicts between White Star Line heir Ismay and Captain Smith , which could have formed aninteresting secondary plot , are given 10 minutes of cursory , obligatory attention , like mere factoids . & quot ; Oh yeah . This was going on , too. & quot ; See the 1953 version with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck . It 's got a love story , too . It also has 3-dimensional characters you can care about and a storyline which involves you !	-1
why did it take 3hrs to tell this story.i could tell it in 2.2 minutes =maiden voyage of a self proclaimed unsinkable ship , bunch of snooty rich people abord suddenly are in danger because , oh my , the driver probably really was drunk and had too much courage in a bottle and thought he could ram a glacier like `` garrr , blasted glacier , get out of me way '' boat sinks , thousands die.the end.the best part of this movie was when find reotardo diCrapio frozen in the water . haha	-1
Just like The English Patient , this is just another in a long line of semi-retarded chick flicks that appealed wonderfully to women on an unprecedented scale , but left the guys wishing Kate Winslet had done the entire movie in the nude . Of course , just to be fair , James Cameron would have had Kathy Bates show up in the buff too . Any way you slice it , this film is for chicks who want to sleep with 100-year old male vampire pedophiles . This film 's core audience moved on to Twilight following this . They 'd dig sleeping with Bigfoot , too . Hopeless romantics .	-1
How can cinematic excrement like this fool so many people ? It'sbeautiful , but there is no substance underneath the beauty . TITANIC proved that popularity does not equal greatness . Thisfilm was made for people with negative IQs , and of course , so utterly precalculated as to include an oh-so-tragic lovestory between two dippy teenagers who belong in a John Hughes movie .	-1
This film is all bark and no bite . I have no idea what everyone sees in this movie . I do n't think that it really deserved all those Academy Awards . It was too long and drawn out , all icing and no cake . It was unrealistic and had bad acting on Leonardo DiCaprio 's and Kate Winslet 's part . I also found the dialog cheesy and laughable.It was exceedingly hard to sit through , let alone take seriously and as a result I 'm forced to give it a 1	-1
I shall resist the temptation to let my strong emotions ( hatred ) influence what I say and review this film objectively , showing how I came to a two star review.I will not rank on the framing of this tale , which could have been interesting . It sets up a modern day crew that is after the glory and fortune associated with being able to excavate Titanic , a sunken luxury liner . An old woman says she was on the ship ( is disbelieved ) and eventually adds humanity to this tragedy of long ago . These characters are interesting . They have needs and goals and , eventually , change . But how this happens gets buried in an unoriginal plot and over-done cinematic spectacle.After two and half hours of love story and tragedy , Bill Paxton , the head of the excavation team , says meekly & quot ; ... all these years I thought about Titanic and I never let it get to me. & quot ; Paxton 's character is supposed to be our 'in ' - he is modern man . When he says that , the audience should feel a similar since that this old tale has stirred their emotion . Yet , that does n't happen . Why ? The stroyline of the back-story ( most of the film ) is dreadful with very little character drive . Jack and Rose are flawless youngsters who stand in defiance of old world fogies . Convenient , huh . Their convictions of early on are only enforced by the circumstances around them - never challenged . Is this drama ? A disaster flick , if is not purely commercial and for the sake of spectacle , can only do one thing - show the stuff the characters are made of in the face of doom : in this film , this is no different than what they are in the beginning ( brash youths ) . Do they grow up ? Did Rose ever ? Does she realize that more often than not they would grow to hate each other , realizing how shallow they are ? Now , all of you Titanic fans will say , & quot ; Surely you must admit this film is a technical marvel of moviemaking and visually captivating & quot ; Again , I raise my fist in defiance and issue a bold : NO ! Titanic 's computer animated effects look exactly like what they are - computer animated . Early on , in overhead shots , little simulated humans move about the digital luxury liner and I sat frozen in my seat , thinking : are they kidding me ? All the while I was expecting the camera to zoom out and see that this is all recreation on a screen that the excavation team was watching . How disappointed I was that this never happened . Pay close attention to these details in your next viewing of Cameron 's unfortunate blockbuster : the cartoon dolphins in the water , the long shots of the sinking ship ( more importantly the never changing computerized horizon in the background ) and most disgusting was the iceberg itself ( which suspiciously resembles the computerized berg that 's shown earlier ) . The computer generated imagery was a huge hack job.In conclusion , a period piece often features lavish costumes and music and makeup and more often than not it is in an effort to create a distinct time and place - one that matches the way the characters feel and think and act . Two recent movies that succeed in recreating there time and place are the severely wronged L.A . Confidential and Elizabeth . The actions and thoughts of the characters and background were so in step with there period and location that you actually become a brief tenant of 1950 's Hollywood and Elizabethan England . But something is amiss in Titanic - the costuming and music and makeup may be nice but it 's all for naught - the motion picture around it is deliberately forgetful to the time and place . The characters are simply disembodied voices moving about some timeless netheregion with occasional stupid barbs such as Hartley saying nothing will come of Picasso when he had already made a splash on the Paris art scene at that time . This is a bad story people ... very bad . The only reason I give it two stars is because the massiveness of the production of this meaningless corporate product has contributed to the surrounding economy .	-1
First of all may I address the hacks of Hollywood : CA N'T YOU PEOPLE SPELL ANY OTHER NAME BUT JACK ? ? ! ! ! Come on , it 's the most overused name and it 's in almost all the movies ! I think there 's a button on your word processors that spell `` Jack '' and all you have to do is press it and it will print it over and over in your script , kind of like the `` F '' word that you folks use in place of actual LANGUAGE ! It was bad enough that Cameron could n't use as characters people who actuall LIVED ; he had to go and invent the most BORING characters who ever ate up 16 hours of my time ( well , it FELT like 16 hours ! ) First of the casting ! Leonardo DiCrapio looks like ( and always will ) an aging teen-ager . If Leo strained really , reeeeally hard , he might sprout a 5 hair mustache ! He 's just another of the aging boy types Hollywood is all agog about : Jude Law , Colin Farrell , Orlando Bloom and others . The only real adult male actor around today is Russell Crowe and he has totally karate chopped his career as brutally as he does hotel employees.And Kate Winslet ! Lord , in terrible need of an extreme makeover ! Nose needs refining , body needs to drop 45 pounds at least ! She looked more like the older girl next door than Leo 's lover , or maybe like his sister which is incest and that 's just eeeeewwwwww ! ! And the hair color on Winslet and her `` mother '' who bore absolute NO physical resemblance , but they tried to `` fool '' us by dousing both with Lady Clairol Un-natural Tangerine Red # 45.As for the excrutiatingly irritating `` love story '' that seemed to suck all the attention and lenghthen this stupid movie , listen up all you ditsy teen-age girls . Here 's what really happened if Jack had lived : Jack and Rose run away to New York to live by the sea ... in a cardboard shack with a corrugated tin roof . Since Rose has STUPIDLY put love above security and Billy N.Zane 's ( well , that 's the characters he plays ! ) millions of bucks , she 's paying for it now.She 's had one kid , added another 60 pounds and has another Little Leo in the oven . New York summers are very HOT and humid , especially if you live in a hot tin box . Leo never comes home from the bar where he hangs with his mates because the big cow beats him up for not working to give her the rich life she almost had . Unfortunately there are no phones , so she ca n't call up Billy N.Zane and beg him to let her come back , but Billy 's into appearances and does n't want a fat broad on his arm who has un-natural orange hair and is breast-feeding ! But I think Billy mercifully drowned before he had to endure to the end of this dreadful flick . I do n't know , do n't remember , do n't care.So to make ends meet , Rose must scrounge aluminum cans so she and the little King Of The World wo n't starve.So much for Happily Ever After.This is reality girls , so make this movie a lesson in life ! Go for the money ! Now as for the title of this review , if I 'd had a dollar for each time Rose was screaming Jack , I 'd have paid this month 's mortgage ! And why was she , with the generous body fat , floating on the raft/door when the skinny meatless squirt was in the ice water ? You 'd think she 'd have taken turns . I was hoping someone would just shove Leo into the water so she 'd stop yelling `` Jack , Jack , Jack ... .. ! `` like yelling your name in your face will keep you from freezing.And dropping the big jewell into the ocean ? ? ! WHAT ? ARE YOU CRA-ZEEEEEE ? ? ! ! Absolutely no way ! You think Jack is down there alive thanking you ? ? No , put that baby in the bank for nine decades , draw interest , if you do n't want the money , give it to the victims of Hurricane Katrina for God 's sake ! Sheesh , this movie just got dumber as it went along.Anyway , my 2 cents and this could have been good if it had only stuck to what really happened . Maybe someday someone will make this story correctly .	-1
New specially developed special effects were used in great ammunt to make the public forget that fact that this is not but one of the silliest love histories ever told on screen ! THe director was smart enough to take a plot ( the sinking of Titanic ) that ever aroses interest in people ( like sharks , for example , or the murder of JFK ) to bring the audience into theaters . Then he filled it with special effects and no histories at all . By the way : at the end of the movie , Billy Zane 's character , that at best could be defined as a rich person full of prejudice , transforms himself almos into the Devil himself ! Absurd !	-1
Titanic has to be one of the worse films ever . There is no two ways about it . It is dreadful and I do n't care how much money it pulled in at the box office or how many Oscars were showered on it . The plot is corny beyond belief . You will find stories of more sophistication and credibility in a Barbara Cartland novel . The portrayal of the Irish ( below decks , of course ) is patronising beyond belief . The special effects are not particularly special . ( The computer generated Titanic looks like a badly drawn cartoon . ) The acting is okay but everyone is miscast . DiCaprio , who looks as if he has come straight out of choir practice , does not convince as the Jack London figure he is obviously suppose to represent . Kate Winslet is not quite young enough to be the innocent abroad . However , they tackle their miscast roles with greater skill and artistry than James Cameron tackles his.I sat through three hours of this monstrous tripe wishing like mad that a U-Boat would come along and sink this turkey . Now that would have been a revisionist plot twist that could have saved this movie . Where is the German navy when you want them ?	-1
It 's so hard to put into words what an utter piece of garbage & quot ; Titanic & quot ; is , because it so shamelessly offends so many of one 's senses simultaneously . Wow , what a stinker.What honestly frightens me is the overwhelming success and accolades it achieved . I had the same sickening feeling when it swept the Academy Awards , as I did when I heard the first OJ verdict.Sinking the boat was well done and they clearly spent a bundle on it . That part was fun to watch , but I 've seen better plot and dialog on daytime soaps . The entire mess was a nicely conceived way to get as many people as possible into the theatres , like a politician that tries to please everybody at the same time . Unfortunately , the end result was actually painful to observe . And what was with that insipid song ! It was nauseating once , but who is buying this thing ? Celine Dion released that hunk of poo on multiple albums and every one of them went mega-gazillion-platinum ! What is going on here ? Two stars for overall production value , for making the huge boat and then sinking it , and just because I still like Cameron for having made Terminator .	-1
Ok mouth breathers ... so you think this is a good movie , huh ? ! There are about 1200 reviews for this movie . They are all to be dismissed ! Here is the TRUTH : James Cameron is a ... This movie is brain-dead . And it 's fans have the mentalities of ... ...	-1
This is a bad movie I do not understand why it won best picture of the year or best director , the acting was so bad as was the writing and story.If you do want to see the best picture for that year watch L.A.Confedential .	-1
Quickreview : This movie sucks and is exploitive . Why ? Great visuals are punctuated by opaque characters who act badly ( on many levels ) mouthing a stupid screenplay ( you gettin ' this Cameron ? ) all wrapped in an inane plot causing victims to turn in collective grave . Upshot : Cameron and Co. make big bucks from horrible historic tragedy using eye candy Leo and Kate for bait . Furthers exploitation of actual wreck which is now being dismatled for worldwide showing .	-1
& quot ; Titanic & quot ; won so many Academy Awards , but why ? Everything about it makes me sick . The direction , script , acting and music ! Sirens to my ears ! I was disappointed that James Cameron directed this overblown 'epic ' about two lovers whose love survived the sinking of the great ship . You know what ? It would 've been great if Arnold Schwarzenegger was in this because he would 've defeated the iceberg . Forget the two hundred year-old woman and her necklace . That 's obscenity . An insanely disappointing movie !	-1
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thats my reacion to this film . I expected a lot more from this movie then some depressing borefest . Its hard to believe that they refused to send nukes up to hit this rock as contigency plan C through Z . Obviously a politically correct self righteous narrow minded film crew made this movie . Not to mention that the special effects [ were bad ]	-1
I 'm sorry , but this is supposed to be a disaster movie ? Since when does a disaster movie have the & quot ; disaster & quot ; in the sub-plot ? ? ? This movie is actually a love story between the ( then ) 18 year old Elijah WOod and 15 year old LeeLee Sobeiski . Nothing more , nothing less . You 'll be eager to see the astronauts on their heroic mission , instead you 'll be tormented by Elijah staring at LeeLee . This movie also disguisted me , for instance , the point of attack ( when the actual movie 's meat started ) comes during a hyper-close up of a fat guy 's cheek blubber shaking as he sloppily eats pizza . The camera is pretty much sitting on the guy 's top lip for about six minutes before the guy looks at at screen and realizes an asteroid is about to hit . I give it two stars only because of a moving scene on a beach between a daughter and father .	-1
The premise of the movie is frightening and captivating at the same time . I expected tremendous special effects , action and drama from a panicked public and government . Instead I got an overated snore fest.Do n't waste your time .	-1
If you think that going to the market and buying canned corn will provide you a gourmet meal an hour later , then this is your film ... and , boy , is it loaded with corn as well as sap and anything else that can be heaved into a movie to make it trite and cliche . Ca n't quite knock it down to a one star level since those sorts of movies are `` special '' in their own right but this one was pressing the boundaries . The ending scenes that were supposed to be so deep and emotional I kept on picturing as being a part of `` Airplane '' or `` Blazing Saddles '' and expected the actors to produce on screen a bottle of syrup in order to enhance the effect of their weeping .	-1
This is a depressing movie about people who do n't like their lot in life so instead of working to better themselves they destroy other people around them . It might have had some redeeming value if one of these characters had learned something along the way . Instead it goes on in a fatalistic hopeless way .	-1
You know , I really like this video , but I hate that I ca n't play it on my Android device . I wonder if Amazon will ever release their Video App for use on Android .	-1
This is a beautifully photographed movie that frustrates me with its laconic pace and unsatisfying relationships between its main characters . I wo n't recap the story here , but will point out that it is essentially a young poor girl 's view of life and the young actress who narrates the movie does an outstanding job . I found myself wanting to continue watching , more than anything else , to hear her voice . He childish take on life around her combined with her unique accent cast a spell that will draw you through this movie like a zombie smelling brains . Lush landscape , historically accurate & amazing narration .	-1
I bought this version . During the entire film a banner across the top advertised some teen movie . Of all the cheap , sleazy hustles we 've been groomed to expect from the dvd revolution ( whatever happened to `` multiple camera angles '' ) the cheesy inclusion of ad banners onto clasic movies heralds a new low for the greedy . Bad buy !	-1
We are currently reading about Moses in our Bible Story Book here at home , and my oldest daughter and I keep smiling because whenever we read this story , and it speaks of Moses and Pharaoh , we picture Charleton Heston and Yul Brynner ! Like a lot of people , I grew up watching this every Easter on TV . I was n't a Christian then , but year after year of viewing , the images just stuck in my head . My oldest daughter ( 21 yrs . ) saw it only once when a child , but certain images of this film stuck with her too . My two youngest had never seen this film , so we went and rented it yesterday . We thought they might like to see the scenes with the plagues . However , we brought it home with the WARNING : THIS FILM IS NOT BIBICALLY ACCURATE . We watched it with Bible in hand , to read aloud what REALLY happened in the inaccurately portrayed scenes . It was disappointing to see so many big and even little details portrayed wrongly . So for this reason , this film will never be owned by us , for I doubt I will waste my time watching it again.It was interesting that my children and I all liked the Egyptian Royalty scenes best . I did as a child too . All those over the top costumes and performances were just fun to see and watch . The parts with the plagues were good too , but my son was sad that it did n't show ALL the plagues . He especially wanted to see the plague of frogs.I found the 2nd half boring , as I remember I did when a child . I think Charleton Heston was sort of a boring Moses . I do n't know if it was the way he talked or what . He kept getting older and whiter-haired while his wife and princess love and mother and Rameses never aged a bit.I do n't know what else to really say , I found it interesting in that after watching it , I felt somewhat upset and agitated , probably due to the many inaccuracies , and probably also because I wasted good time watching something not really worth all that much . Yet I felt it was a good lesson to my children to make sure to check anything we see or read that is portrayed as & quot ; Biblical & quot ; with the real truth of the Bible . We can not trust any man to give us the truth of God . All must be checked beside the truth in the Bible.So I would not recommend this film at all from a Biblical point of view . I would n't even recommend it as good entertainment really . of course there were the interesting points I mentioned above , the crazy costumes ( some looked a bit too Roman ... maybe Cecil re-used some from his earlier epic , Sign of the Cross ? ) , the Egyptian sets , and the dialog ( now some of that was worth hearing ; very dramatic and even funny ! ) .	-1
I agree with Roger Eberts Review in which case Old and Young Love the Rugrats , The old try to hide it but they still do.The problem is Rugrats Movie does go directly more for kids , and it would be in my words over shadowed by the greatness of it 's sequel.It represents itself as more of a musical and frankly that was just annoying for me .	-1
I do n't understand why this film gets 5 stars . This film is n't very exciting , it dons n't have a very good plot and when your 10 years old about half way through you 'll realize that it is n't going anywhere . anouther porblem I have with the film is that at the begging you see the babys smach in to a window-wall , that part is totaly unneed ! Plus the drama is realy bad as well as the animation theres something wroung with if , I think it has something to have to do with it being darker animation then the show and it more rufe anaimation . I hape Rugrats in Paris is better .	-1
Basic summary of movie : Dil is born . Rugrats get away in Reptar wagon . The adults find them . The end.As you can see , I left out the plot and all the detail . Why ? Because there was NONE TO PUT IN ! ! Geez , ever since the Rugrats series took a four year break , the entire thing became an overrated pile of junk . Go use your money on rocks . Or even paper clips .	-1
Opinion here on Amazon is divided as to whether it 's okay to review a book or film you did n't make it to the end of . Personally , I 'm of the view that if you gave it an honest shot but just could n't make it all the way to the end , it 's okay to say so.I did sit down and try to watch this . Twice . Both times I got about 30 to 40 minutes in before I just could n't keep going . From what I did see , it seemed almost a case study on how not to turn a TV show into a feature length film.Basically , all the characters do exactly the same things they do on the TV show . It 's just that the writers try to give them more `` serious '' problems to tackle . Something to try to put everyone a little out of their comfort zone . To create the illusion that this time , things might not quite work out . Or at least to give our heroes problems that might plausibly take more than half an hour ( or 11 minutes ) to resolve.Somehow , like so many TV show to feature film conversions , it just does n't work . Maybe half an hour ( or 11 minutes ) of watching the rugrats do their tricks is enough . A format that makes perfect sense as a half hour TV show does n't often translate terribly well to feature length . I 'm not even sure why myself . I 'd welcome comments on this review from anyone with a theory about this.But whatever the reason , somehow ... it just doesn't.Theo .	-1
This is the Worst double dipping ever . worse then the Star Wars . at least he changed things with the feature . digital remastered . Here all that was done is change the Box Set . from The Adventures of Indiana to the Indiana-THe Adventure Collection , and added one or two never before seen bonus material . First of all ? Is there a Mystery collection ? horror Collection ? of course its called the THE ADVENTURE COLLECTION . its Indiana friggin Jones.seriously , if you want the first three get the other set its cheaper . or wait till christmas , when ALL 4 will be in a Box-SET.TRIPLE DIP !	-1
Despite high powered talent both in front of and behind the camera , & quot ; The General 's Daughter & quot ; emerges as a tepid , run-of-the-mill murder mystery set on a deep South army base . The murder victim is the ( to put it politely ) sexually loose daughter of the camp 's highly distinguished general ; Travolta portrays the investigator , torn between loyalty to the military and to his civilian duties , whose job it is to unravel the mystery of her bizarre death.Though based on true events , the film 's screenplay fails to develop a particularly compelling or surprising story , settling instead for a gallery of essentially stereotypical characters . We have , for instance , the cynical , but essentially decent tough guy investigator , the hard-as-nails female helpmate , who , of course , has shared a failed romantic past with the hero , and the by-the-rules-at-all-costs military father , willing to sacrifice his daughter 's life on the altar of doing what 's best for the institution . In addition , the film lines up the usual array of red herrings , false leads , and strawmen suspects that Travolta 's character must bat away before the final solution is revealed . That resolution comes in the form of a ludicrous , barely credible scene in which the guilty person , as always , pointlessly explains to the investigators every detail concerning the execution of the crime.Given nothing in the way of fully developed or fleshed out characters to portray , the actors are left to essentially sleepwalk through their roles . It is obvious none of their hearts are in these dull proceedings . Travolta needs perhaps to begin challenging himself a bit more in more demanding roles and stop settling for such routine assignments as the one he has found in & quot ; The General 's Daughter & quot ; .	-1
First the good - the actors are fantastic . James Woods , Timothy Hutton , James Cromwell ( that sweet old farmer in Babe ) John Travolta , Madeleine Stowe - they are all wonderful performers . The movie really builds up in the first half and you 're thinking , oh wow , who did it , how 'd it happen - the suspense is great - but the second half just kind of falls flat.The plot line , in it 's whole , is more than a little implausible . The military is made up of normal men and women , most of which are good decent folks . I doubt *the terrible secret* could have been maintained - as this movie portrays.And the graphic sex scenes and violence against women were too much for me . I do n't see how that added anything needful to the plot.The second half and the ending were very disappointing . Kind of left me looking at the VCR timer and wondering - how much time is LEFT on this turkey ? I gave it two stars because of the acting , the music , the first half ... But 1.5 stars would be more appropos .	-1
I knew this movie would have a lot of holes in it when , in the beginning , the title character changes a tire WITHOUT A JACK . Wow , if she could do that then the writers are n't paying much attention and , after awhile , neither was I . None of the people here are in the least sympathetic so we really do n't care who did what and why . So the film meanders along with a few seemingly shocking developments but comes to a silly end to the relief of all . Everyone here is diminished by this one .	-1
The General 's Daughter , promised to be the next great action thriller from John Travolta turns out to be nothing more than a sick perverted twist on films that ended like it , such as L.A . Confidential . Anything and everything is shown in this film , from sadmasicism , to rape , to a woman ( The General 's Daughter ) sprawled out for all too see on the ground . The story plays out fairly well the first half , The General ( played by James Cromwell ) has ignored his daughters rape for years , so that he can move ahead in the military . John Travolta comes in to investigate something , does anyone know ? Well besides the obvious , with the exceptions of a few good performances by , James Woods and Travolta , this was a very poor movie , and sick in my opinion . I left the theatre with a very bad taste in my mouth . My advise , by Phenomenon !	-1
Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones are two of the most talented actors around these days , and while they , like everybody else , have to make a living , it is sad that it has to be in pictures like this . Yet another in the line of wrong-fully-accused-innocent-oridinary citizen who develops amazing detective skills while fighting to avoid unjust punishment . This movie is about as long and bad as that last sentence.Ashley is great , and for some of her fans , just watching her for an hour and a half might make this movie . But , she and Jones are wasted in this & quot ; thriller & quot ; . Anyone who does n't know how this movie will end ten minutes after it started has n't seen a movie since Carter was President . The plot is bad , and the ending is so obvious , anyone can call the action before it happens.If you want to see a thrilling , seat of your pants movie about somebody wrongfully accused , go back and watch & quot ; The Fugitive & quot ; again . This is just a cheap imitation of that excellent film . If it were n't for Ashley and Tommy , this would n't even merit two stars .	-1
I watched this film hoping that there would be something good about it ( no matter how samll it was ) that could help justify how this film made so much money . Unfortunately I sat there on my couch for 90 minutes ( it seemed more like a prison sentence ) , stupefied , frankly appalled at everything I saw.I ask what was going through anyone 's head when they made this ? Ashley Judd , a solid actress who did a fine job in & quot ; Heat & quot ; is absolutely wasted in this film . She plays a Mother , wrongfully accused of murdering her husband who is locked up for seven years . Her husband has of course framed her so he can collect insurance money . Tommy Lee Jones who has given great performances in both & quot ; The Fugitive & quot ; and & quot ; Under Siege & quot ; is completely wasted as well . He basically is playing a meaner version of his Sam Gerrard & quot ; Fugitive & quot ; role . Bruce Berresford , the director of & quot ; Driving Mrs. Daisy & quot ; seems completely incompetent . Not only is this movie poorly made but it is not even marginally entertaining in the slightest fashion . Stop trying to make thrillers Brucey ( you made Silent Fall too ) , because a two year old could produce a better film than this.This movie plods along in the most dull , contrived and predictable fashion . It single handedly indulges in just about every film cliche known to man . Ashley Judd is a mushy character not nearly as hard-edged as the trailers might suggest.I could rant and rave about this film for hours . This movie is basically a TV movie that somehow made its way to the big screen . The only people who could possibly enjoy this film are the ones who have never seen a good movie before in their lives and believe & quot ; I Still Know What You Did Last Summer & quot ; is a great piece of art .	-1
In all , this is a nice to watch film . It kinda reminds the Tommy Lee Jones classics The Fugitive and US Marshals , but Judd 's interesting quest to find her betraying husband keeps us up to pace , really eager to see what she 'll do when she finds him ! Or will Jones find her first ? So , in all , it 's a good film , but both the Fugitive and US Marshals rate better than this one !	-1
I was very disappointed , after watching Double Jeopardy . The movie is about Libby Parsons ( Ashley Judd ) who is framed for her husband 's murder . While in prison Libby finds out her husband is alive . She is eventually paroled and begins to seek out the whereabouts of husband . Libby 's parole officer ( Jones ) feels Parson can not be trusted . Parsons eventually eludes Jones and goes across the country looking for evidence while Jones is hot on the trail . This movie had all the elements of the Fugitive . Tommy Lee Jones acting was subpar . The entire storyline was very predictable and hard to believe . Save your money !	-1
Double Jeopardy is n't particularly bad or good , it 's just kind of there . While watching it I kept wanting to reach for the remote to see if anything else was on ... and then remembered that I 'd actually rented it.The movie wants to be & quot ; The Fugative & quot ; or any the other & quot ; man/woman wrongly accussed & quot ; flicks , but it ca n't live up to the real thrills that & quot ; The Fugative & quot ; had , and Ashley Judd simply ca n't hold a movie like Harrison Ford . Tommy Lee Jones is competent , but not nearly as compelling as he was in that earlier movie.The plot ranges from tolerable to utterly implausible , combines with the lackluster acting to create a movie destined to be show again and again at 3 p.m. on Sunday afternoons on the & quot ; Million Dollar Movie & quot ; .	-1
Have n't watched yet ! tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorites ! I think my hubby ordered this movie , I will watch in the future !	-1
`` Double Jeopardy '' has such a high `` check-your-brain-at-the-door '' quotient that you have to wonder if it was made by adults . I could see a bunch of clever fourth-graders coming up with the plot of this movie , but anybody know knows anything whatsoever about the legal system , even the legal system in movies , will want to flush this epic . Ashley Judd and her amazing one expression plays a loving ( but incredibly stupid ) wife and mother who is convicted of killing her husband and sent to prison . There 's no body , but the court takes the prosecutors ' word for it . Then in prison she learns that hubby set her up by faking his own death , and is now shacked up with her best friend and her young son . Of course , she ca n't tell this to anyone because the system has no interest in reopening cases . But on the advice of a fellow inmate , a one-time lawyer and husband-killer , she does manage to convince the parole board that she 'll be a good little girl , so they let her out of prison after serving six years of a murder sentence . Sure , why not ? She goes to a halfway house run by Tommy Lee Jones , who is so inept that she manages to steal his gun from him , and then sets out on a quest across the country to track down hubby and get her child back ( hubby has already murdered the best friend/surrogate mother ) . We are led to believe her goal is to really kill her husband this time , since she ca n't be charged twice for the same crime , under double jeopardy ( and what better way to impress your ten-year-old son than reemerging as a stranger and blowing away his dad ! ) . Jones tracks her as she leaves a trail of destruction ( Judd 's character never met a car she did n't wreck ) and thievery all across the US . In most scenes Jones seems to be wincing , perhaps as he remembers winning an Oscar for a similar role in an infinitely better film called `` The Fugitive . '' This film is reminiscent of an old Saturday morning serial wherein the good guys leave wrecked cars , exploded buildings and bodies strewn all over both sides of the highway in their quest for righteousness , and nobody else seems to notice . Criticizing `` Double Jeopardy '' in detail is like shooting the proverbial fish in the proverbial barrel . It 's just that lame .	-1
Elizabeth Parsons ( Ashley Judd ) is a happy woman . She has a handsome husband , who 's popular with the local community , a son , Matty , she treasures , a beautiful seaside home , and a friend , Angie , who her son loves . This is a woman who you quickly feel has it all . Just as quickly , something goes terribly wrong . Her husband , Nick ( Bruce Greenwood ) , surprises Liz by showing her a large sailboat and suggests that they take it out for a spin before he buys it for her . We next see Liz happy at the helm of this boat and all seems idyllic.What happens next is not so idyllic . Liz , who has been drinking , wakes up to find her robe , the bed , the floor , and just about anywhere you can look covered with blood . There are blood trails , bloody handprints , bloody footprints , leading out of the cabin , up the stairs , and over the side of the boat , now shrouded in fog . Liz looks down at the deck , sees a bloody knife and makes her first apparent mistake ; she picks it up . Just as she does so , a Coast Guard cutter pulls up and compels her to put the knife down.A few scenes later , with no sign of Nick 's body , Liz finds herself under arrest and also finds a healthy dose of evidence that she did the deed . Without much ado , Liz is convicted and sent to prison . She asks her friend , Angie ( Annabeth Gish ) to adopt Matty because she knows Matty loves Angie . This accomplished , Liz sees Angie and Matty for a visit or two when suddenly Angie stops bringing Matty to the prison . When Liz calls Angie , she finds the number disconnected.So far , so good . However , now the contrivances kick in . Without so much as a disguised voice , Liz calls the school district where Angie works pretending to be Angie verifying the address of & quot ; her & quot ; severance checks . From this call , Liz discovers Angie has moved to San Francisco . So , Liz calls ; Angie answers ; a heated discussion follows . Finally , Liz gets to speak to Matty . While talking , the apartment door open and who walks in but Nick , presumed dead . Matty says & quot ; Daddy ! & quot ; and suddenly , Liz realizes she 's been set up.Apparently , she tells all of this to two inmates who have taken Liz under their wing even though there 's no compelling reason for them to do so . Roma Maffia and Davenia McFadden play the inmates , respectively Margaret Skolowski and Evelyn Lake . Skolowski , a convicted murderer who happened to be an attorney , tells Liz that she can actually kill her husband since she 's already been convicted of murdering him anyway , a provision of the Constitution 's Fifth Amendment.Now , for those of you who 've read my earlier review of The Negotiator , some of what follows may sound familiar . All of this action to this point has taken place in the span of a half-hour ; notice , nowhere have I mentioned the character played by Tommy Lee Jones . That character is Travis Lehman , her parole officer who is portrayed as a no nonsense guy who does n't give second chances.What follows from here to the end is a film I could n't help compare with 1993 's The Fugitive . Lehman pursues Liz across Washington State , Colorado , and New Orleans , as she herself follows the trail of her missing son and the husband who framed her.This film had the potential to be a great thriller and one reason it got even two stars was for a marvelous Hitchcockian sequence in a New Orleans cemetary that was actually pulled off by director Bruce Beresford . The climatic scene was near-perfect as well . What falters is the overly contrived script by David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook , who were responsible for The Rock , where they did a much better job . Weisberg and Cook sets up situations and then do n't follow their own rules . So , instead of a taut thriller where you wonder how our heroine is going to accomplish her tasks , the whole thing comes off as kind of lethargic.Jones gives a journeyman performance as Lehman , the parole officer who comes to realize that he 's pursuing an innocent woman . Judd is excellent and does everything that 's asked of her , although at times , she seemed a bit subdued . Bruce Greenwood imbued Nick with a kind of charm you could almost love if you did n't know what he 's done to his wife.I love mysteries ; I wanted to highly recommend this film , but in the end , I ca n't . Double Jeopardy may be an OK way to spend a rainy afternoon , to view at a discount movie house , or to rival a TV-movie , but as a top-notch thriller , it does n't make the grade .

Good lord . What an awful piece of work with an excellent premise . Libby Parsons ( Ashley Judd ) and her husband Nick ( Bruce Greenwood ) have their minor problems , like every married couple , but they 're okay , or so she thinks . One weekend , Nick rents a boat , and they go out for a weekend sailing . Libby gets drunk , passes out , wakes up with blood covering her clothes and no husband . She is convicted of his murder ... and finds out later he faked his own death in order to take their son and run off with her best friend Angela ( Annabeth Gish ) . Under American law , a person can not be convicted of the same crime twice , so Libby decides ( with a little help from a co-con ) that when she gets out of prison , Nick needs to die . After all , she 's already done the time.I want to see Judd , Tommy Lee Jones , and especially Greenwood ( who plays just as good a total slimeball here as he did playing a fine , upstanding gentleman in Fox 's excellent series Nowhere Man ) reprise their roles in a remake of this film directed by someone who could have done it right -- Hideshi Hino ( Guinea Pig ) . As it stands , this is a thoroughly boring jumble of Hollywood cliches that dies n't even rate a video rental . Avoid at all costs .	-1
Gere is interesting as a gigolo caught in a thriller situation . However , I found it a bit depressing . If you are a woman who likes an attractive guy , maybe that 's enough . It gets a bit desperate in coming up with twists that do n't pay off .	-1
For anyone who read the novel by Frank McCourt , `` Angela 's Ashes '' would 've been one of the most anticipated movies of the year . The book , which is terrific , takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride without cessation ; there are passages so gripping it becomes almost unbearable at times . The movie , however , directed by Alan Parker and starring Robert Carlyle and Emily Watson , unfortunately does n't come close to capturing the desperation , hopelessness and pathos of the book . McCourt 's autobiographical account of growing up in extreme poverty in Limerick , Ireland , is a gut-wrenching experience ; that he even survived his childhood under such conditions as he recounts is a minor miracle in itself . His father , Malachy McCourt Sr. , ( played by Carlyle in the movie ) , was n't a bad man , in an evil sense ; he was just no good . He loved his family , but was too weak , prideful and irresponsible to even begin to look after them at all . Though reasonably intelligent , apparently , he was nevertheless lazy to the point of slothfulness , could n't keep a job even if he lucked into one , and most of the time did n't bother looking . He never had money to keep bread on the table , but somehow always managed to have enough for tobacco and for a `` pint '' at one of the local pubs . Carlyle , a fine actor ( great in `` The Full Monty '' ) , never seems to get to the core of this admittedly complex character ; the ability to mine the depths of what really made Malachy tick somehow eludes him . His performance is passable , but it 's all on the surface . Emily Watson fares little better with her Angela . A Gifted actress ( Breaking the Waves '' and `` Hilary and Jackie '' ) , she handles what she is given to work with aptly enough , but there is so much more that simply goes untapped . She , too , never really seems to get to the soul of Angela , whose whole life was nothing less than tragic . And with such rich source material from which to draw , it 's puzzling as to how this movie failed to deliver the emotional impact promised by the story . That Parker chose to use the same voice as the novel to tell it is one reason , possibly . The matter-of-fact , stoic narrative that worked to great advantage in the novel simply does n't translate well to film , at least not in this case . Here , it merely falls flat ; somehow it gives an ambivalence to the proceedings that keeps the young McCourt , his family and their circumstances , at arms length throughout . Visually , the movie is stunning , though ; the cinematography successfully captures the bleakness of Limerick and the surrounding countryside . Parker , however , fails to blend it all in sufficiently enough with the actual story to make it effective . Using the same approach for visual content as he does for the emotional , he succeeds only in presenting an image without enticement . He asks his audience to bring more to this than they can , given what they are being offered ; it simply is n't enough . Still , it in no way diminishes the artistic merit of the photography , which is , in fact , the high mark of this whole endeavor . The young McCourt is portrayed in three successive stages of his youth by Joe Breen , Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge ; all able performances . The supporting cast includes Ronnie Masterson ( Grandma Sheehan Keating ) , Pauline McLynn ( Aunt Aggie Keating ) , Liam Carney ( Uncle Pa Keating ) and Eanna MacLiam ( Uncle Pat Keating ) . For those who have n't read the novel , `` Angela 's Ashes '' will provide some touching moments , though nothing particularly memorable . This should have been a ten-hanky movie ; instead , it leaves the tear ducts dry and the heart just a little empty . This is an unfulfilling rendering of McCourt 's acclaimed account of his childhood and , on a larger scale , the failure of society and of the Church to truly minister to all it 's members . The humor , which is laced throughout the novel , is lost here as well , which is nothing less than negligence on the part of the filmmakers , because they have excluded what was undoubtedly one of young McCourt 's basic tools of survival . In the end , then , this film , which should have been remarkable , was one of the biggest disappointments of the year . And it 's a pity , yes . ` Tis .	-1
Paramount should have been shut down for making a film that glorifies a woman with total disrespect for her fiance ( s ) , men in general , and everyone else in her life . Roberts is her usual strange self and should be sent the bill for all the resources wasted finding Jennifer Wilbanks after she decided it would be cool to imitate this braindead movie .	-1
The contrived and utterly predictable plot is not the problem of Gary Marshall 's disappointing & quot ; Runaway Bride & quot ; . Few romantic comedies , also the terrific ones , are known for their original story . Much more important is HOW you embellish the standard plot . & quot ; Runaway Bride & quot ; does not a good job in this department.First of all you have to say that the characters in this film are neither appealing nor interesting in any way . This makes it difficult to be captivated . You do n't really care about any of the people on screen . Especially Robert 's role is poorly written and Gere does the best he can in his thankless part.. Only some of the supporting actors , for example the scene-stealing Hector Elizondo have at least one or two good scenes . This is not enough to save the film which is also far too long . The creators just did n't manage to conceal the schematic nature of the film well enough. & quot ; Runaway Bride & quot ; was a huge success at the box-office , mainly due to its high-voltage star duo . It is however very unlikely that it will become a classic like the 1990-hit & quot ; Pretty Woman & quot ; , which at least had a certain freshness when it was released .	-1
that 's the best thing you can say ; very cute , and just fine if you liked Pretty Woman ; Richard Gere is very charming and sometimes funny , and Julia is Julia ; there 's cameoes by Larry Miller and Hector Elizando ( ! ) ; check out the soundtrack , featuring Shawn Colvin and the Dixie Chicks - it 's not bad	-1
Geez . What a disappointment . I saw this flick in the Theatres and fell asleep . My date thought this movie had so much potential but just did n't deliver . The previews made the film look so wonderful , so funny and so romantic . But it turned out to be just another cheesy and cliche-ish flick . A total bore . Richard Gere plays a tell-it-as-it-is reporter . He lives a simple and snappy life . His quick and witty responses to everyone is humorous and reflective of his outgoing nature . Julia Roberts plays an enigmatic and gorgeous country-girl who gave up a potential big city career to take care of her alcohol loving dad . Well , she 's also The Runaway Bride and instead of asking why , everyone just makes fun of her . She 's not a & quot ; ditz & quot ; but she takes it with a smile ( well , duh ! she 's still not an air-head cause she 's JULIA FREAKING ROBERTS ) . Anyhow , the story goes downhill from there . Sounds silly ? I thought so ... The cast is brilliantly cast . Problem is , only Hector Elizondo and Rita Wilson showed any spark or originality . The others are just shells of sterotypes . The movie is directed by Super Director Garry Marshall . The problem is , we are all so emersed in the credits , what comes on screen is just smothered with potential and never really fills our appetite for a good film . I love Julia Roberts . I love Richard Gere . But this movie is just terrible . Terribly cliche-ish and Boring ! Not an ounce of fun or humor or originality or romance . Oh , the Romance , did n't mention that in this Romance-comedy . Well , there is NO spark or chemistry between Roberts-Gere . They are acting to a void . In fact , Roberts and Gere acted BETTER individually than in the same screen . Honestly . Gere was brilliant in NY and Roberts was acting great in her hick town . Then they got together and the movie went down the tubes . This was a sell-out . It made tons of money in the theatres but it 's nowhere near as good as it seems .	-1
Richard Gere plays a newspaper reporter who ahs been sacked because he ca n't write , er , good articles . When Richy hears about a Runaway Bride named Maggie Carpenter who likes to dump grooms ride at the altar , he decides it is the perfect story to win back his job . So , he immediately goes down to Maggie 's home town . She is currently engaged , and he is not leaving until she runs from that chapel again ! However , when our Richy falls for Maggie , things get more and more complicated . Is he still in love with his job ? Or is going to go for Maggie instead ? Runaway Bride has a perfectly good idea , but the script is poor and weak . The direction from Mr. Marshall is not near as good as the effort he put into Pretty Woman . The leading actors have good names , but unfortunately their performances are n't good enough to give this film an extra star.Do not waste your time on this unbearably stupid trash !	-1
I was dragged kicking and screaming to this one by a lady friend . I have actually found a few chick-flicks watchable and mildly entertaining , but found this one especially cheeky , corny , and predictable . An excrutiating looong 2 hours !	-1
I think there reaches a point in the lives of many a movie star , where they get too big for their britches and decide , `` Gee , I 'm so famous . Everyone loves me . My movies are always the best . I get paid millions per picture . '' I have had it about up to here ( imagine my hand at eye level ) with Julia Roberts . I am of the firm belief that beauty and charm do not an actor make.Allow me to expound on some of the sickeningly contrived plotline for you . We first meet Ike Graham ( Richard Gere ) , a columnist for USA Today , whose inspirations for his column come very last minute , and often as a result of an interesting conversation with a tavern drunk . The audience tags along on just such a day when Ike learns from a barstool companion about a girl from his hometown who has left somewhere in the neighborhood of seven or eight men at the alter.Fast forward , Ike writes a woman-bashing article about the hometown girl , Maggie Carpenter ( Julia Roberts ) which is nothing short of slanderous . She takes umbrage with this bit of irresponsible journalism and fires off a letter , stating she has left three men at the alter and is planning to wed soon , attempt number four . She also attacks other aspects of his article , point by point.One must ask ... .would n't this person have people above him in the chain of command at USA Today who would never have allowed such reckless journalism to go unchecked ? Never fear , justice prevails ! Per the recommendation of legal counsel , USA Today kicks blasphemer Graham out on his can . Although , his editor probably deserved some kind of reprimand as well . Even big shot columnists need to remember , sticks and stones may break your bones , but WORDS can hurt just as badly . So , licking his wounds , Graham goes after the REAL story about Maggie Carpenter , black widow of brides . He is seeking to redeem his good name when he makes the trek to Hale , Maryland.Idiotic premise number one : since when does rural America mimic a Norman Rockwell painting ? As a denizen of rural Iowa , I am disgusted with the Hollywood stereotype of small towns . Not everyone drives a tractor around town , not everyone knows everyone else , and not every small business owner hangs a cute little homemade sign in their shop window that says , `` Be back in five minutes '' so they can go see Earl at the corner barbershop for a quick shave and a haircut . A good example of Hollywood 's rural misconception is another Julia Roberts flick , Sleeping With The Enemy . This story took place in Cedar Falls , Iowa . A town I know and love , having been born there and having finished my elementary school years there . Cedar Falls is a town of about thirty-five thousand , in addition to being home to the University of Northern Iowa , which boasts a student body of nearly fifteen thousand . Yet , in that lame movie , there are bright smiling people standing around with their cows watching the American flag being raised in the town square . Gim me a break . Last time I checked , many towns have a leash law for dogs . Taking your favorite bovine for a stroll downtown is not in the cards folks . Idiotic premise number two : a woman who repeatedly leaves men at the alter is still loveable and cute , just a little mixed up . Hello ? I thought about going to [ ... ] to find out what a psychologist might have to say about such a person . But , I thought the better of it and asked a psychologist friend , actual real live guy , and asked him.Is a woman who repeatedly leaves men standing at the alter screwed up in the head ? YES ! He did n't use the phrase `` screwed up in the head '' , that 's what I said , he said some doctor stuff that I 'm not smart enough to recall , but he basically concurred with my observation that Julia Roberts ' character is cuckoo for cocoa puffs ( this , also , is not a technical term according ) and in need of some therapy.Idiotic premise number three : Julia Roberts and Richard Gere only make great movies . Those two together in a film does n't necessarily mean the movie is going to be any good . It might make a lot of money , sure , but as for artistic integrity , not one iota.You may be hoping to see an updated , slightly different version of their first go-round Pretty Woman . While Pretty Woman was a stretch story-wise and basically cornball , it was well-thought out and endearing anyway . The mega stars seemed to put a little more stock in that one , with well-rounded characters and following the story through to the end . Runaway Bride seems to have been an ant at a picnic for Gere and Roberts . Annoying , but not much they can do about it , so continue on with the picnic . Their acting is without conviction and about as multi-dimensional as a piece of paper . In a nutshell , Runaway Bride is a predictable , blah movie . There are some nice moments but they do n't come often enough to pick things up .	-1
Christopher Walken is good but everything else ( except the cinematography ) ( is bad ) . Ricci seems to serve no purpose except to hold up her wig . The screenplay is disjointed and pointless .	-1
This film lived up to its name ; Sleepy and Hollow . This is a movie for teenagers with bad taste . It 's hard to believe anybody takes this film seriously . Yes , visually it was pleasing but the characters were one-dimensional and hyperbolic with few exceptions . The suspense was poorly paced.Yes , the cinematography and costumes were very nice but hardly a reason to endure the bordem .	-1
Blu-ray holds such promise , and this disc fails to deliver on it . Granted it was one of the earliest titles , but as mentioned it is grainy , and the colors do n't exactly pop and sometimes it seems darker than it is probably supposed to be . I did not do a direct comparison with the DVD which I used to own , and while overall it is probably better looking due to increased details , i.e . you really see people 's lines in their faces , etc. , I 'd suggest waiting until the re-do this and do it right unless you just must have it . Sounds good , but does n't have the latest in audio either , such as an uncompressed track . It 's also a 25GB , which is pointless when all Blu-rays with content of this length should be 50GB .	-1
I watched this movie last night having heard that it was a really good movie . But , I guess I was n't watching the same movie because the movie that I saw was n't good . The movie had a great cast with Tom Cruise , Ed Harris and Gene Hackman and a great plot . The plot is about a Harvard Law graduate who takes a job from a small Memphis firm . The firm offered him lots of money , a mercedes and a nice house . So life is of course perfect for the graduate and his wife . WRONG . After two men from the firm mysteriously die , the FBI contacts the grad . and ask him to retrieve classified documents from the firm . I do n't want to give away anymore or else I 'll give away spoilers , but the movie is a dissapointment . The editor 's review from Amazon says it 's fast paced . On the contrary . The movie is very slow , quite boring and very confusing . The whole plan that the grad . sets up is very confusing and is n't well explained , and the movie progresses VERY slowly . Besides being confusing and boring , the music was also annoying . It did n't go whatsoever with the movie Towards the end , at one suspensful moment , there 's the happy weird music that does n't at all go along with it.The acting is great but everything else is just terrible and this movie does n't seem believable at all .	-1
... because The Firm was actually good . One of my favorite books . As for this ? It might not be as bad if you 've never read the book , but if you have you will most likely not like it . Think about any plot point from the book and chances are it 's been changed either a little or a lot in the movie version . The basic events are the same , but some things are changed so much it 's rediculous . I would go into more detail , but I 'm trying to stay away from spoilers.Conciseley : characters given a lot of time in the book get hardly any in the movie . And some in the movie are featured a lot more prominantly than in the book . Long scenes and memorable parts of the book are gone and boring ones that seem out of place of sketchy appear in the movie . I do n't remember Terrance being bald . And the ending was absolutely different.I 'll surely never watch this movie again . Do n't buy it -- get the book . If you do n't like reading , skip over this entirely . It 's just not worth your time , stale acting and poor characterization aside .	-1
What a horrible movie ! I can believe Matt Damon was in this . There were only a few elements which were tolerable , the rest was pure garbage .	-1
Oh , boy . I have to say that I hated this movie . I could n't believe how poor it was compared to the book . It 's a shame because I really do enjoy the work of the actors . I appreciate artsy movies as much as the next guy who pretends to like artsy movies but there comes a point where something has to happen . The problem is that when it does 'happen ' I just did n't care anymore.As my dad used to say while watching The Young Ones with me & quot ; Why on God 's good name ... . ! & quot ;	-1
So many positive reviews for this film . it was one of the worstmovies I have ever had the displeasure of seeing , Matt Damon ... did an ok acting job . thats as far as the positives goes.. The plot is just ridulas everyone else looked more like fools trying to act . by the way did I mention how Horribal that Plot was.. Normally I 'd say rent this movie before buying it , But dont even bother , its not worth the 4 bucks for one viewing let alone multiple ones .	-1
This movie , picturesquely set in a well depicted recreation of the Italy of the fifties , was an incredible desecration of the classic style of Hitchcock 's film noir observations of the pure evilness of certain types of psychopathic id . I am recalling & quot ; Strangers on a Train & quot ; and & quot ; Shadow of a Doubt & quot ; .I was really looking forward to seeing Matt Damon portray the primary character , a non-entity who takes on the personality of a Princeton reprobate ( Jude Law , nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor ) living in idle luxury off his & quot ; allowance & quot ; in Italy , together with his fiance , played by Gwyenth Paltrow . Paltrow seems to have studied Audrey Hepburn 's breathy voice and mannerisms to portray her role as the fifties style , pretty , but weak and overbred , upperclass fiance . She does a good job , but the role is essentially minor . That the role is minor is a typical deficit in this off balance movie.Jude Law , as the Princeton & quot ; bad boy & quot ; , does a good job as well , but he is not worthy of the nomination he got for supporting actor . Why ? Because the script is perfectly awful and he is forced to play his part within the major limitations of the script . I liked seeing him tear it up in a jazz dive but the charisma he is supposed to have , and the classy background he was supposed to be born to , was not conveyed clearly enough to me . He was as ill served as Paltrow in this movie.Now , on the the greatest disappointment of this film . This was the film I intended to watch to decide if Matt Damon is really any good as an actor . I am sorry to say that he was incredibly inept in sustaining my interest in this movie . He portrays , here , the lousiest psychopath I have ever had the non pleasure of watching onscreen . It is usually interesting to find out why an amoral person is capable of doing the awful things he or she does . What were his motives ? Well , if you can stand the boredom of waiting this movie out , Damon will spell them out for you about five-eighths of the way through . I dare you to care at that point . His facial expressions run the gamut from his usual teeth baring , ingenuous , open smile , to that half sneering , half open smile he had in & quot ; Good Will Hunting & quot ; . How has he gotten so far as an actor ? I am astounded that this movie got any good reviews at all . It was interminable , poorly written , and had only one thing going for it : the scenery of Italy lensed through a big pile of American movie money.best , jean	-1
i saw this movie in the theater when it came out because i like that matt damon and philip seymour hoffman . however , after what seemed like 9 hours waiting for something to happen in this film , it ended . maybe i missed the point , because it seemed to me the point was to make the audience very bored !	-1
I Did n't get the Fuss over this Picture.I Just Rented it & amp ; I Did n't get what The 50 's , Jazz , Italy , Homosexuality , etc.. had to do with this Picture.I watched this Film & amp ; I Discovered that they Showed a Miles Davis Album Called Tutu that was Released in 1986 not the 50 's ? also a John Coltrane Album that was Put out in the 60's.but the film Ended so Fake.Nobody put Matt Damon as The Killer.it was Too Slick & amp ; Shallow.Gwyneth Paltrow was alright but nothing Special.this Film lacked Tension it was Boring from the middle to the End.Will Smith 's 6 degree 's of Seperation was far more COnvincing than this Film .	-1
Although , I like Mike Myers i the & # 34 ; Austin Powers & # 34 ; movies , this movie was so & # 34 ; STUPID & # 34 ; ! I did n't get the function ofthese guys characters ! Also not a & # 34 ; Dana Carvey & # 34 ; fan ! No biggie , gave it to my daughter/her husband .	-1
Funny movie , but this is so dumb I can just give it two stars . That does n't mean I did n't like it , trust me I did . But it 's not a serious film so ... Dana Carvey is hilarious as always , where has he gone ? He has so much talent . Sequel is just about the same , almost better with the help of Chris Farley .	-1
I had never seen an Elvis movie before , but had heard that the King 's film career was a mixed bag . Still , I bought the DVD of & quot ; Blue Hawaii & quot ; in a spirit of fun , not expecting Shakespeare , but maybe a bit of light entertainment and a few good songs . What I got , however , could be summed up in three words : hokey , hokey , hokey ! Honestly , who was the audience for this movie ? I ca n't imagine anyone but someone 's grandmother ( and I apologize to all those hip grandmothers out there who are in my corner on this one ! ) going in for the silly gags , inane story , and goofy characterizations , as they hum along with the ( mostly ) mediocre songs . Hey , you know you 've got a problem when a movie goes for laughs with an out-of-control garden hose . I wanted to check the credits again to see if Sherwood Schwartz produced this thing as training for & quot ; Gilligan 's Island & quot ; and & quot ; The Brady Bunch & quot ; . It 's hard to imagine that Pat Boone-ish fare like this contributed to Elvis 's stature as a sex symbol and international star . Okay , I will say that the scenery was nicely photographed and one or two songs stood out among the filler , so I 'll try to keep an open mind and give another Elvis movie a shot . But this one gave me a real education , and the lesson I learned was this : let the buyer beware !	-1
Good very good loved it what Elvis movie is n't good . But blue Hawaii is one of my favorite Elvis movies.. Love the songs.. ,	-1
On paper , BOTD seems to have everything going for it -- a decent budget , a screenplay by Paul Schrader , a strong cast and one of the most acclaimed directors of all time . It also happens to feature striking cinematography and a few audacious set pieces . And yet it bombed in the theaters for a simple reason : it fails to engage the viewer . The plot of the film is a straight line , with a distinct lack of narrative tension . Nick Cage 's blank , shellshocked expressions may properly represent his character 's emotional state , but they do n't really express anything , and they do n't draw us in . As if to compensate for this flatness , the film contains pages and pages of Cage 's monotonous and portentous voice-overs , which are mostly irritating . A lingering shot of his character 's bookshelf , that allows us to read every spine , is an appalling way to convey to the viewer that he 's a & quot ; deep & quot ; thinker.There are actually too many appalling things in this film , mostly compromised attempts at solving intrinsic problems in the subject matter . For example , there 's the problem of maintaining a coherent story through the inherently random and discontinuous episodes of ambulance driving . Solution : a few recurring characters , the most egregious being a raving lunatic who , except for Cage , appears in more scenes than anyone else in the film , becoming increasingly more annoying with each unlikely encounter.And then there 's the unbelievably heavy-handed religious allegory , culminating in an immaculately-conceived birth . The parents are squatters ( no room at the inn , of course ) , and the mother is named Maria . Jesus.I do n't get it . What possessed Scorsese to fill his film with so much amateurish garbage ? And how did he , a native New Yorker , manage to create such a cliched and blatantly unrealistic picture of the city ? I 'm generally a fan of Scorsese and Schrader , but this has to be their stupidest and least entertaining film . It 's full of hokey philosophizing , but one ca n't help feeling that they 're simply and rather crassly milking the main character 's proximity to dying people without having anything interesting to say about it .	-1
A long disheartening look at an occupation one would normally count on in a crisis . However , after watching this film I have my doubts . If the intention was to skewer the medical profession , this succeeded admirably . I do n't ever want to count on a hospital or ambulance drivers/paramedics ! If it was meant to be satire , it was n't funny.Well made , yes , especially the arresting imagery , but , on the whole unrelentingly depressing . Left a bad taste in my brain.And no , I did n't think it was a zombie movie . But it is a strange title .	-1
Nicholas Cage is a great actor . I admit that but this movie has so many flaws i ca n't list them in one review . it 's just really crappy .	-1
In viewing the film , I happened to miss the opening titles , but in sumbmitting this review , I was shocked to find that John Schlesinger , one of my all time favorite directors , had something to do with this nonsense . Plus it hardly has a happy ending . Gay man and straight woman try to raise young son ... all is not well on the homefront ! Madonna , first off looks horrid . Despite a well toned body , she has become frightening for me to look at . Though her acting is always slightly above average , the trite dialogue is not pulled off by either her or the always fine performances of Rupert Everett.On another note , I 'm actually beginning to believe that Neil Patrick Harris is gay . ( Did n't he turn up on Will & amp ; Grace last season ? ) This actor is so talented ! After all , we all believed that Doogie Howser really WAS a doctor ! His emotional performance of a man that looses his lover to AIDS should not go unnoticed.A few years back , there was a film that was similar in subject matter called The Object Of My Affection , with Jennifer Aniston , which ran circles around this movie . Mainly because it included something known as & quot ; a good script & quot ; . Something this film clearly does n't have.On the plus side , you have to give Schlesinger credit though for bringing to the screen what other directors would never in a million years . Next time John , read the script first .	-1
She keeps on trying does n't she , our Mads , like the trooper she is . No matter how many times the critics trash her . Honestly , this movie had a lot of potential , with an interesting story line that tackled a kind of a modern day re-definition of family units and the moral dilemmas and choices involved . With its very worthy supporting cast it could have really gone somewhere but just failed to get there.Madonna god bless you , I truly wish you could read this because I have two bits of stern advice which I 'm sure many others would agree with , to help your ( flailing ) acting career , if it 's not too late . Firstly , get some major voice coaching ! Your delivery of dialogue is so unbelievably stilted and wooden at times . It 's like you 've just learnt the script . And what is up with this phoney pseudo half British half American accent you put on ? Was that supposed to be part of your character development or research ? . Even though her gay best friend 'Robert ' is British , the audience would assume 'Abbie ' is just an American living in LA . Besides which , it just sounded so fake . I mean we know you 've become a bit of an 'Anglo-Phile ' now that you 're married to a pom ( Australian slang for 'English person ' ) , but you do n't have to make it part of every character you play now do you ? Concentrate on your acting craft before you start with the specialty accents luv . Meryl streep you aint . Secondly , if you want us to believe in Madonna the actress you 've got to leave out Madonna the pop star just for a moment , and quit with the mindless marketing of your pop image , just for the sake of selling more records . My god woman , why does nearly everyone of your movies have to feature your music in the soundtrack somewhere ? That scene early on in the film , where you all sing American Pie , at the gay friend 's lover 's funeral , was just sooo embarrassingly contrived and unnecessary . And quite frankly , fond as I am mostly of your music , your recorded version of 'American Pie ' was very weak . Just lifeless.I know I am being a bit harsh but someone really needs to tell you these things , or rather you really need to hear them , 'cause I have actually been a fan of yours from the beginning . Despite your money hungry commercialism , you 're an amazing artist and woman in so many ways . I see the potential in your performances often and you have an incredible presence on stage and screen that can not be denied . But when it comes to the craft of acting a lot more subtlety and discipline is required and you need to learn a bit of humility darling , come down to earth.Now , as for the redeeming features of this movie , and there are some . I would love Rupert Everett in anything he does . He 's so cleverly sardonic and witty in that classy British way . Unfortunately though he is sold rather short here due to a poor script and mediocre direction , but I still enjoyed his performance . I must say I did feel awfully sorry for Robert near the end . He must have felt , intentionally or not , tricked and used by Abbie in a way . I mean she really should have taken responsibilty to ensure who the father was initially , do n't you think ? . Benjamin Bratt is most easy on the eye and a welcome hetero-sexual addition . Also , I loved the colourful 'Sante Fe ' style design and setting . As well as Madonna 'hippyish yoga teacher ' chic , ( though the yoga thing is also somewhat contrived , no doubt Madonna 's influence ? ) Lastly , there are moments ( yes some ) when Madonna 's acting and character are believable . I always find her the most convincing in her character 's more casual , fun moments . Which makes me think she is better suited to lighter comedic roles like earlier on in her career . The kid who plays Sam is quite natural and cute . In reality though that poor child would be left feeling so torn and confused after all that had occurred . He 's faced with the prospect of three fathers ( or at least father roles ) in his life . Overall I quite enjoyed the first part , but really lost interest when the 'same old , same old ' court room battle scene came around . This movie is n't a total waste of time and it 's always interesting to see what 'Queen Madonna ' will come up with next .	-1
This appeared to have the 4 major holiday Peanuts specials . It was expensive enough . And looking at the cover , there are 4 photos on it . Missing is the Easter Beagle show . They do give you one or two extra Peanuts shows of some sorts , but it would have been far better to just put the Easter special on it . Disappointed .	-1
I 'm sorry if the header is cruel , but I sat through this film twice just to see what I was missing . I still did n't find what all the praise was about . This is a well-meaning film that is well-written and well-acted to show ordinary people with ordinary situations they have to cope with in their lives . But that 's the problem . Everything is too ordinary.The main story is about what happens when a grown-up brother and sister are reunited after a lack of communication for awhile . He is somewhat of a drifter , and she is a single mom who works at a bank . The bond they share is that their parents were killed when they were young , and they 've depended on each other for mutual support for many years . When the brother returns , she has to make a decision on whether it is a good or bad influence on the son . Complicating matters are the identity of the father of the child , the current dull boyfriend , and a new boss so finicky he needs standard computer screen colors for his entire staff.I 'm looking at these events compared to those of my own life . I have four children , and it seems like every week we have some kind of crisis that makes anything that happens in the movie seem tame . I mean , her brother takes the kid out to a pool hall . Maybe if he were turning the kid on to the pot he smokes in the movie it would be a big thing , but I find myself saying that this woman has no problems.While the portrayal of her new boss is dead-on accurate , I myself has a boss that makes this one look like Jim Belushi . I live with my situation , and once again , I 'm trying to find out what the problem is here . For the record , I 'm not having an affair with my boss , and I guess showing her having her affair is to show her as a flawed , human character.In conclusion , I do n't think the brother is so bad , I do n't think the boss is THAT bad , and I do n't think the mother is that over-protective . If the writers would like some REAL things to be worried about , they can ask my family , or better yet , watch & quot ; Malcom in the Middle & quot ; , which is much more realistic than this film.By the way , my wife watched it with me , and also asked what the big deal was .	-1
The original Wizard of Oz movie was horrible . It is very loosely based on the original Wonderful Wizard of Oz book . A new movie series should be made.MGM changed so many things from the book in this movie it 's ridiculous . Here is a list of just some of the things that are not true to the original book.1 . The magical shoes Dorothy gets at the beginning are the Silver Shoes ( Not Ruby ) .2 . The time spent in Oz is real , not a dream.3 . The three farm workers , story teller , and miss gulch , do not appear in any Oz book at all.4 . The Wicked Witch of the East and the Wicked Witch of the West are not related at all.5 . The Wicked Witch of the West does not appear in the book until Dorothy and friends travel to the West on the Wizards orders.6 . They went to the West to kill the Witch , not to take her broom stick.7 . Glinda is the Good Witch of the South , not the North.8 . Glinda does not appear in the book until the final when she tells Dorothy how to use the Silver Shoes to get home.9 . Munchkins all wear blue.10 . The road is called the Road of Yellow Bricks , not the yellow brick road.11 . The journey to the Emerald City is much more dangerous and long than depicted in the movie.12 . No one sings in the book.13 . The Silver Shoes can be removed while still alive.14 . The unnamed elderly Good Witch of the North greets Dorothy when she first arrives in Oz.15 . All witches in Oz wear white , not pink or black.16 . Dorothy was not rescued by the Scarecrow , Tin Man , and Lion at the Witch 's Castle , she rescued them after killing the Wicked Witch.17 . Glinda does not come to the Emerald City at the end of the story , Dorothy and friends have to travel to the south to ask for her help.18 . The Wizard appeared in more than one form , not just a giant floating head.19 . The four companions visited the Wizard one at a time , not all at once.20 . The four companions stayed in the Emerald City for several days.21 . Dorothy was the Witches captive for several days , forced to work for the Witch.22 . The Winkies , the Witch 's slaves , all wear yellow.23 . The Winged Monkeys are only bound to serve the Witch three times as she owns a cap that controls them . After performing a task they leave.24 . Dorothy takes the cap of the Winged Monkeys after killing the Witch and uses it herself.25 . When using the Silver Shoes magic , Dorothy clicks the heals together three times , and wishes to go home to kansas , she does not say there 's no place like home.26 . The Wizards balloon was dismantled after he arrived in Oz , and Dorothy and him built a new one out of green cloth.27 . The Wizard was from Omaha , Nebraska , not an old Kansas man.28 . The Emerald City did not exist when the Wizard arrived in Oz . When he was first made the ruler of Oz the Emerald City was built on his first order.29 . The keeper of the gate to the Emerald City did not deny Dorothy and friends entrance to the city.30 . The Munchkins thought Dorothy was a Good Witch because she wore a faded white and blue checked dress . White being the color of a witch and blue being the color of the munchkins.31 . Dorothy 's house landed in a ditch no where near a Munchkin village , and only somewhat near the road of yellow bricks.32 . Dorothy 's house never returned to Kansas.33 . All Munchkin houses are painted blue.34 . The gift given to the Scarecrow was not a diploma , but padding in his head to mimic brains.35 . The gift given to the Tin Man was not a heart clock , but a stuffed satin heart put into the Woodsman 's chest and then patched over with tin.36 . The gift given to the Lion was not a medal , but a bowl of liquid said to be courage that the lion drank.37 . The Wicked Witch of the West did not have green skin.38 . The Wicked Witch had only one eye.39 . The Wicked Witch melted from water because her wickedness had dried her blood out of her body years ago.40 . The Good Witch of the North gave Dorothy a magic kiss on her forehead that protected her , that is why the Wicked Witch of the West would not harm her.41 . Dorothy was saved from the poppy field by field mice , not by Glinda.42 . When Dorothy returned to Kansas the Silver Shoes had fallen off over the desert surrounding Oz.43 . In the final chapter , Dorothy tumbled into Kansas in a field near her Aunt and Uncle 's farm , and a new farm house was already being built by her Uncle Henry .	-1
I was fooled . This is 4:3 FORMAT . I could not adjust it to my TV for widescreen viewing . This movie is great but I bought the blueray because it said was widescreen . Beware , buyer .	-1
Amazon recommends this for ages 3 to 6 ? Who decided that was a good idea ? I think I was six when I first saw this movie and it left me with nightmares ! I have never held any great affinity for the great classic Wizard because it traumatized me so , but then again , I was also terrified of the Snow White ride at Disney when I was about three . Everyone has to see it simply because it 's such an integral part of our great American lifestyle -- there are so many references and spinoffs concerning it , if you have n't seen or read the story everyone around you will think you 're an idiot -- but if you 're with a child who 's watching it for the first time , be sensitive to the fact that some of the stuff in it is rather disturbing , and be sure to talk about it afterwards with your little friend . Sorry , people , but this surreal stuff for kids ( like Alice In Wonderland and Dr. Seuss ) always makes me wonder what drugs the authors were taking when they conceived some of this stuff . I can endure Wizard and the like now and be bored , but a 3 to 6 year old might grow to fear flying monkeys for awhile or green witches who crumple and dissolve like salted garden slugs . Classic American weirdness . Was it really just a dream ? Run , Toto , run ! Why own it anyhow ? It 's played with a lot of pomp and hype at least once a year on regular tv . D'ya really need to see it more often than that ?	-1
I do n't own this DVD , but watched the movie on a black-and-white TV screen . And I was already disappointed to watch the movie in the defective 4:3 format . To put their dirty hand and cut short of this wonderful masterpiece , how dare they , when they are given such a media like DVD ! I should just wait for the widescreen version which I do n't know when to come out.I meant five stars for the movie , and no star for the DVD .	-1
So you think this is good eh ? Well , it stinks ! There is'nt much point in watching it . This movie should be a movie only babies watch . For some reason , my sister likes this movie ! ? ! Now tell me , what could be more pointless then watching a little girl and other stupiod characters ( tin man , scarecrow , etc ) going to a castle where the Wizard turns them back to where they belong . Boring ! Graphics 0/5The worst graphics in history . Even movies like Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer had cooler graphics . When I 'm watching it , I force myself to see once I get to the castle part ... .. woooosssshhhh I run out of the room so I do n't see this totrure.Sound 1/5The sound is okay . But difinitly not the bestOverall 0/5Whatever you do , do n't buy this If you do , you are giving me your money and I 'm going to buy you the Increbles . You will and I mean WILL be sorry if you by this	-1
Amazon and box descriptions state the movie is in widescreen 1.77:1 format , which is a lie . Further reading of the box description states the movie is in & # 34 ; 1080p High Definition 16x9 1.37:1 & # 34 ; ; a paradox . The & # 34 ; widescreen & # 34 ; statement is opposite the 1.37:1 statement . The Warner and Oz start splash screens are 16x9 widescreen , but the entire movie is in 4:3 . I thought that I might have chosen a wrong setting . However , no screen format options exist in the movie 's menu . The image quality is grainy , being worse in the B & W ; part of the movie and getting a bit better in the color part.The box states audio is & # 34 ; DTS HD MA , English 5.1 , Dolby Digital & # 34 ; which is also a lie . The audio is terrible and barely qualifies for simulated stereo . That pales in comparison to my recently purchased & # 34 ; Billy Joel at Shea Stadium & # 34 ; disc which is fantastic in 16x9 widescreen and HD audio ( not a hardware problem with my home theater system ! ) .I 'm very surprised at all the high ratings for this disc . Apparently , most reviewers are just so in love with Oz that the false claims of widescreen picture and HD sound just do n't matter . They do to me and that 's why I 'm returning the disc for an instant refund ASAP .	-1
Not a Brosnan-as-Bond fan to begin with , so factor that in , but this is probably the worst Bond movie of the entire series IMO .	-1
Number 17 in the Bond series is pretty much a compilation of 90 's action films and as a result has dated considerably . I consistently see this film put among the best Bond films in fan forums , particularly among the 18-30 age group , either for the sake of nostalgia or the fact that they loved the video game this spun-off of . I do n't hate Goldeneye but I am rather annoyed by this film 's so-called `` classic '' status among Bond fans , and non-fans , alike.I am just going to be frank , Pierce Brosnan is dead-last on my list of Bond actors . He never brought anything worth value to the role of Bond except having the right looks . It seemed like the previous actors did everything else for him and he was just there to fill in the empty slot . Even Roger Moore , who was a bit too much of a comedian in his Bond films , had a remarkable talent of making the dumbest lines and moments dignified no matter how bad his films got . Brosnan is n't a bad actor but he was a total non-entity . He felt like a coporate logo as opposed to a character.The film itself moves quickly enough with a standard larger-than-life scheme that would impact the world . A former 00-agent , 006 Alec `` Janus '' Trevelyan played by Sean Bean , betrays Bond and manages to take control of a EMP weapon housed in outerspace . The weapon , dubbed Goldeneye , has the capability rendering electronic items useless . Trevelyan was alledgely billed as `` the man who knows James Bond '' but the writers never took advantage of this . He does every Bond villian cliche . Does he leave Bond to die in a escapable trap ? Yes . Is he surprised every time he shows up alive ? You bet . Alec even pulls a `` Blofeld '' and lets Bond stay in the control room to screw up all his plans . On an ironic note despite my mis-givings of Trevelyan , I always thought that Sean Bean would have made a far better Bond . Bean is a little rough around the edges but he carries himself far better than Bronsnan in this film and actually having the better dialogue.Basically , this is a very standard action film . Natalya was a decent Bond girl , the other minor villians ranged from great like Ourmunov to the very annoying Xenia and Boris . There seems to be echoes of major action films from the 90 's like Terminator 2 , No Escape and yes , even Jurassic Park when the film shifted to Cuba inside Trevelyan 's base of operations . Eric Serra 's film score is lagerly inappropriate making some scenes just far too moody and there is a litter of general James Bond cliches . There were better Bond films made and Goldeneye is n't one of them.As an aside note , why did this film look so cheap ? They spent far more than they had on The Living Daylights just eight years earlier and yet Goldeneye looks like a TV movie . Sure there was a few good shots in Monte Carlo and Cuba but everything else looked like rubbish . Then what further exacerbated the film 's cheap look was the excessive use of minatures . Practically everything that blows up or flies in this film , and it was a lot on both counts , clearly was just a model . If you think I exagerrate Special Effects Supervisor Derek Meddings , who died before the film was released , himself stated he made more models in this movie than any other film he worked on and he had worked on many blockbusters over his long career .	-1
Pierce Brosnan , who did a spectacular job with `` The Thomas Crown Affair '' , makes a surprisingly weak James Bond . He 's almost a perfect splicing together of one of the better Bonds , Timothy Dalton , and the all-time worst , Roger Moore . That 's too bad because Brosnan is a fairly good actor . If the producers had tried to portray Bond as Dalton and Fleming did , I think he would have done a fairly good job of it . Once again , `` The Thomas Crown Affair '' demonstrates how good Brosnan can play cool , ruthless and debonair.The movie itself is n't very good and does n't really reference Fleming except in the title . They took one plot element from `` Moonraker '' and that 's about all of the Fleming you 'll find in `` Goldeneye '' . That 's too bad because a lot of Ian Fleming 's ideas have never made it to the big screen.The first four Bonds and OHMSS are fairly faithful to Fleming and that 's about it . `` Live and Let Die '' , `` Living Daylights '' and `` For Your Eyes Only '' also feature a few of Fleming 's ideas but not enough to make them worthwhile.The new `` Casino Royale '' had quite a bit of Fleming in it , particularly in the center section of the film . That 's a good thing . Remakes of `` Live and Let Die '' , `` Moonraker '' , and `` Diamonds Are Forever '' would be welcome , particularly if the screenwriters use the Fleming novels as actual launching points , as they did with `` Casino Royale '' .	-1
I labored to get through this film . I have a sense of humor , but this film was devoid of anything resembling humor . Nathan Lane is one of the most overrated actors on the planet . He is n't funny at all , period . The story in this was predictable and silly . I did find Pricilla Queen of the Desert to be a much better film than this one , I laughed alot at that film . The Birdcage should get pooped on .	-1
The original French film , La Cage aux Folles , was so good that The Birdcage falls on its face , much like Benny Luke 's hilarious Jacob in the farcical French version . Robin Williams is disappointingly unconvincing , and somehow the humor of the French lines fizzles in the English translation . The cast tries hard , but this remake is ponderous . Skip it and see La Cage aux Folles instead .	-1
Robin Williams is one of my favorite comedians , but this movie was somewhat disappointing for me , even though there are a number of hilarious scenes in it . The gay Guatemalan house & quot ; maid & quot ; is absolutely hilarious and the fact that ultra right wing colleague of moral majority politician Gene Hackman died while visiting an under age , black prostitute made me howl with laughter.Unfortunately , Robin Williams is not able to play a convincing homosexual man with a long-standing relationship . I have never seen a homosexual couple where there was so much distance between the men .	-1
I liked parts of this movie- but Robin Williams character seemed cold and selfloathing and too cold to his fabulous partner . Where has the warmth between them- actually- where was the warmth from Robin ? I do n't see why his partner would love him as he was verbally abusive and the only warmth I saw was one tiny scene where he actually holds his partners hand for one whole second ! Robins was miscast in this role - it would be better if someone else had his role . Then maybe we could have an actual believable love between the couple . Otherwise this is just mainstream media trying to make a buck of the gay community .	-1
Here you go for all the people wondering the EXACT spcifications for this `` special edition '' . 5 Stars for the movie , 5 stars for the E ! Documentary shown in Oct. the past few years ( I 'll be watching IT for sure again ) , and Negative 666 stars for the extras.Presented in Anamorphic Widescreen with its soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby 2.0 this 25th Anniversary Edition of Poltergeist also includes the They Are Here : The Real World of Poltergeists Revealed documentary in 2 Parts : Science of the Spirits and Communing with the Dead . Also on the disc is the Theatrical Trailer.Audio and subtitle options are English ( 5.1 and 2.0 ) , French , Spanish ( both 2.0 ) and Portuguese ( 1.0 ) . Chinese subtitles are also included .	-1
Love the cast , love the ideas , but this movie never scared me over twenty years ago when it came out and it definitely does n't now . It felt more like an amusement park ride than a horror film.There were rumors at the time of its release that Tobe Hooper had been fired or barely showed up , giving control of the film to Steven Spielberg . I 've never heard any follow up to that , but it 's obvious that this movie is more of a Spielberg film ( cute kids , harmless thrills , constant tracking shots , etc . ) than a Tobe Hooper film ( think of the dark , mischevious cynicism of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE ) . I do n't know.All the whispering scenes drove me nuts . Did they think the ghosts would n't hear them ? The `` experts '' in the story did n't seem afraid of anything and made the supernatural sound fun and fulfilling . How can you feel any dread when Beatrice Straight and that crazy little psychic are all giddy ? THE EXORCIST makes POLTERGEIST look like an afterschool special on Nick at Nite .	-1
Part of this is ripped-off from `` Alien '' and part of it is a corruption of a very fine sci-fi idea now probably forty-years old . Premise : a message from outside our solar system gives the DNA code for an alien species to grow within a human reproductive cell or embryo . Not able to resist such juicy stuff , scientist Ben Kingsley ( as wooden as you 'll ever see him ) follows the recipe and lo and behold a beautiful monster is reared . And escapes . Naturally.So far so cute . She leaps over fences and crashes through windows and grows from pre-adolescent Michelle Williams to fully ovulating adult Natasha Henstride in days . She has one thing on her mind : reproduction . Anything that gets in her way she kills . She can give a mean lingual kiss that goes out through the back of your head should she feel threatened.Well , if this is a metaphor for the urgency of the feminine reproductive imperative I think they should have played the Power Station ( ? ) song with the lyric , `` She wants to multiple/Are you gon na do it ? '' in the background.Anyway , as usual the plot deteriorates into a drawn-out chase scene that Hollywood thinks the mass mind craves along with the usual stupidities . I could watch only because Henstride is sexy enough to forgive a few bad alien genes .	-1
The Natasha Henstridge vehicle that was supposed to make her a star arrives dead on arrival despite good performances by Michael Madsen and Alfred Molina . Henstridge 's acting is unbelievably abhorrent . We follow her , along with Fitch ( Ben Kingsley ) and his crack team of academic superstars , as she maims and kills , always pre-coitus . It 's every man 's worst nightmare , and the worst idea a writer ever had to lure in a male audience : thinking you 're going to get laid and actually dying instead . When Henstridge and Molina 's cultural anthropologist manage to put enough time together , the third act problems begin , and so did my tension headache . This movie is so unerringly bad , I found myself wishing for an ET cameo , if only to teach Henstridge 's alien some manners .	-1
Not a good movie at all . Was very disappointed . I understand this is an older movie but I do n't think I would have liked it back then either	-1
What a let-down . I had never seen the orginal movie in 1969 - finally bought it and was really disappointed in the overall movie . I really did n't see what the fuss was all about . Jon Voight and especially Dustin Hoffman gave terrific performances but I thought the movie style was really odd ( was probably very cool at the time ) and overall was very disappointed when I finally viewed it . Watched it once , will never watch it again probably .	-1
The cinematography is great , but the movie is boring , tiresome and vulgar . Save your time and money	-1
Only five films should really be considered a part of the Pink Panther/ Inspector Clousseau series : 'The Pink Panther ' , 'A Shot in the Dark ' , 'Return of ... ' , ' ... Strikes Again , and `` Revenge of ... '' . Forget the Alan Arkin 'Inspector Closseau ' movie and the films that postdate Peter Seller 's death ; they are all terrible and not worth your time . The first two , the original 'The Pink Panther ' and 'A Shot in the Dark ' are very entertaining , incredible comic masterpieces - well worth inclusion in anyone 's DVD collection . Not coincidentally , these two were made within a year of each other when both Sellers and producer/ director Blake Edwards were at the their top form . Unfortunately , when the pair reunited a decade later for the first of three sequels , something was lost . While the final three films were financially more successful than the earliest two , each sequel in succession ( starting with 'Return of ... ' ) increasingly diminshed in quality in every way - in the writing , direction , acting , plot , and comic charm.While ' ... Strikes Again ' does have its moments , it is hardly an excellent film , let alone one of the better 'Panther ' or Sellers movies ... Much of the comedy just does not work , especially most of the ( former ) Chief Inspector Dreyfus ' Bond-like mad villian plot , and the Gerald Ford scenes which may have been topical at the time ( and was probably a SNL/ Chevy Chase rip-off ) , but certainly do not pass the test of time . I blame much of the failure of this film on the sub-par writing and direction.As mentioned in several other reviews , this film was inspired by the James Bond series and in turn proved inspiration for the Austin Powers series ( and I do not intend that to be a compliment ) . It 's unfortunate that Mike Myers was not inspired more by the Seller 's and Edwards ' better work in the earlier films . I would suggest that you rent 'The Pink Panther Strikes Again ' before purchasing it . I recognize that one 's taste in films is subjective , and if you thought the Austin Powers movies were hilarious , you 'll love this one as well . ( By the way , 'Revenge of the Pink Panther ' - the last sequel - is worse than ' ... Strikes Again ' . ) The picture quality of the DVD was extremely disappointing . While MGM 's 'The Pink Panther ' and 'A Shot in the Dark ' appear to be remastered/ restored versions , ' ... Strikes Again ' appears to be merely transferred from a VHS edition of the film , and not a very good one at that . Also as other reviewers have pointed out , this DVD version probably is not the complete film but an edited version ( perhaps for televison or a revised theatrical release ) . This is surprising because MGM is marketing their four Panther/ Clousseau DVD 's as a series . You would think that more care and consistency would be made for each one . Perhaps someone decided that this entry in the series just was not worth the effort .	-1
Someone at the telecine operator at MGM/UA must have been asleep when this gem of a movie was transferred to Blu-ray . Amazon states the aspect ratio as 2.35:1 , which is the way this film is supposed to look . But the back of the Blu-ray package says 2.20:1 , which is in fact the aspect ratio you get here . But the Technirama system should be 2.35:1 , so what is the effect of all this ? Well , the image on the Blu-ray has been vertically stretched , so all the actors have thinned - yes even all the famous cars used in the film look thinner than they should . What a pity , as the transfer apart from this mistake looks splendid .	-1
The Phantom is a notorious cat burglar who robs jewels from the rich . He 's become the passion of Inspector Clouseau ( Peter Sellers ) , a bumbling detective in Paris . He 's the foremost expert on the man.Which is why Clouseau takes a trip to a Swiss ski resort when Princess Dala ( Claudia Cardinale ) does . The princess is the current owner of the renown Pink Panther Diamond , a jewel sure to be a target for The Phantom.When Clouseau and his wife ( Capucine ) arrive at the resort , they meet Sir Charles Lytton ( David Niven ) and his nephew George ( Robert Wagner ) . But what Clouseau does n't know is that plans to steal the diamond are already in motion . Can he figure out what they are and who the villains truly are ? I 'd heard about this movie all my life . After enjoying the remake , I was even more interested in seeing the original . I needed not have bothered.Let 's start with the fact that this supposed to be a comedy . There were two funny scenes , one of which started off funny but went on way too long . The other of which was way too late in the movie to redeem it.Then there 's the caper plot . This is n't a true mystery , which is fine . But the caper was boring . It stalls for about the middle hour . I mean , nothing really happens . This movie could have easily been cut by half an hour without losing a thing . Heck , the musical number added nothing to the film to start . And do n't even get me started on the horrid ending or the illogical holes in the plot.I 'll stick with the modern version of the franchise . This one was a big waste of time .	-1
I had seen this many years ago and thought I remembered liking it . It was really stupid -- plot , situations . I wish I had spent my money otherwise	-1
I was probably too distracted to focus on this movie and missed a bunch of the gags , but I did n't enjoy it as much as I 've enjoyed many other Peter Sellers movies .	-1
This movie stinks . It is about a crippled Vietnam vet who turns Jane Fonda into a cheater . He rolls around her house in his wheelchair with his shirt off and it makes Jane get wet and slushy all over.The part I like best about this garbage is when Jane 's husband comes home and blows the creep away with a shotgun hole in the middle of his exposed chest . That part is really cool . Unfortunately , it was left out of the version I saw , so there are no saving graces to this film at all.It ends with the cheated-upon husband running into the sea with his backside jiggling . Thank you for that unforgettable junk.Jane is as wooden as a soup ladle .	-1
As if to counter-balance `` The Deer Hunter '' , good old Jane Fonda starred in `` Coming Home '' ( 1978 ) with Jon Voight . Saved by the pure benevolence of American goodwill from a treason trial , she was allowed to pursue her craft ( she is excellent at it ) . `` Coming Home '' seemed to be the realization of the self-fulfilling prophecy she created in 1972 . It was that year that she traveled to Hanoi , the heart of America 's enemy , and allowed herself to be posed on Communist tanks , wearing an army helmet . It was blatant `` aid and comfort '' provided to an enemy during a time of war . Jane did not stop there . Like a modern day Tokyo Rose , she got on the radio and told the troops their wives and girlfriends were having sex with hippies and protestors back home . To this day , the G.I.s have never forgiven `` Hanoi Jane '' . She tried to apologize and say she was wrong , but her heart was never in it.Eventually she married CNN founder Ted Turner , a man who may not be the anti-Christ ( but may be ) , and may not have achieved his success by invoking Satan ( but may have ) . When Turner saw CNN employees adorned in `` ashes '' to worship Ash Wednesday , he went ballistic about `` Jesus freaks '' in his employ . Such a crime ! Jane , in the first move she ever did that I liked ( other than wearing skintight sex clothes in her hot-selling workout vids ) , declared she was a `` born again Christian . '' That was the last straw for Turner , who divorced her . There is no word on whether Christianity took in Jane 's life , but I wish her well.In `` Coming Home '' , she portrays the very cheating wife she described to the boys in her `` Hanoi Jane '' days . She tries to pepper the performance with an apology to her officer husband , Bruce Dern , but it ends up being more of an explanation , which in light of what we know about Vietnam does not wash. Two thumbs down .	-1
Somebody running away from something scary in a gimmicky setting with twists and turns ; that 's Westworld . One-dimensional characters , inane dialogue , cheesy costumes , predictable machine goes berzerk `` story '' , and generic sets are the essentials that provide the thrills in this over-long movie . Like a majority of scary movies and the stories from which they are derived , the premise is to pile very contrived problems onto the harried protagonist trapped in a `` Bloodybones is on the first step-Bloodybones is on the second step-Bloodybones is on the third step ... '' dilemma ( Michael Crichton and Stephen King are the masters of the genre } . There 's nothing new under the sun and there 's nothing new in Westworld .	-1
Watch amoral Hollywood elites live out their fantasies - I think not . The only redeeming quality is watching technology turn on the Moabites .	-1

Just shows that you ca n't trust anyone anymore ! Not in the land of DVD , anyway . Based on my positive experience with Goodtimes ' superior transfer of `` Angel and the Badman , '' I went with Goodtimes for their version of this nice old Lassie flick.At first , all looked well -- the title screen and the chapter preview pages are sharp and colorful . Imagine my shock when I selected `` play movie '' and a murky , ghost ridden , dirt speckled image darkened my screen ! This is absolutely the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen . Looks something like an old 8mm print projected on a bed sheet and transfered to video with a VHS-C camcorder ! Three additional things : First , I had to wait 3 months for it to arrive . Second , a tiny blurb on the rear of its el cheapo keep case reads : `` Discs replicated in Hong Kong or Taiwan '' ( I 'm not sure this means anything quality wise ) . And three , there is a disclaimer in the opening titles that reads , `` Transfered from the best available material . `` Bull tangy ! There is a beautiful VHS version of this film that was put out a few years ago -- colorful and sharp ! When VHS looks worlds better than DVD , something is very wrong ! Admittedly , the price of this Goodtimes offering is low -- $ ... Hmm ... do you think maybe consumers are supposed to swallow an unwatchable mess like this just because it only put them out $ ... plus postage ? The message very clearly is this : Steer clear of cheap DVDs , just as you would very wisely steer clear of cheap VHS movies , which are usually recorded in EP mode . The penalty in DVD land for low price seems to be that quality is extremely variable and unreliable . Sometimes the DVD will be okay , but often the quality will be just good enough to toss into the trash.In fact , that 's what will happen to this DVD of `` The Painted Hills . '' I 've opened it , so I ca n't send it back . It 's so awful , I ca n't sell it on eBay or give it to anyone . The only thing left to do is to give it to the trash man ( without his knowing it ) .A total waste of money ! But a lesson well learned.BTW , sorry to have to give this `` dog '' one star . There really should be a BOMB option .	-1
That 's it . Do n't expect anything more than a bare unoriginal storyline . Loads of inconsistencies , like showing the same boat sometimes appearing to go North , then South , then inland and sometimes in the middle of an ocean .. I do n't know . It pretty much summarizes the movie . Lots of fight scenes interspersed with random cuts to scenes that for the most part are just filler and barely tie what plot there is together.Not being an admirer of fight movies , I ca n't claim to be an expert , but I 'm sure I 've seen better in older films .. and the settings are so contrived , I thought I was watching a video game.Good points : It was n't so bad that I could n't sit through it .	-1
The best way to give you an idea of what this movie is like is to mention that the final fight between Van Damme and Bad Guy takes place in the rain , at night , it is cold and muddy , and Van Damme takes his shirt off . Unfortunately , he does n't get pneumonia , his kick-boxing career does n't end , and we end up having to watch at least six bloodsport sequels . Oh well.If you need to know more than that , keep reading . Van Damme plays a dumb guy who likes to jump kick , who has to protect a female cyborg from evil post-apocolyptic guys who are trying to re-destroy the world . Personally , I do n't really know if it MATTERS if the world is destroyed AFTER the apocolypse . I mean , if everything is radioactive and plagued and un-civilized already , making everything radioactive and plagued and uncivilized AGAIN wo n't make very much difference . But I digress . It 's a stupid movie . A very stupid movie.Maybe if the evil guys were trying to prevent the female cyborg from un-destroying the world . That would be more logical . I must confess that I did n't really leave the movie with much of a sense of the plot , as I was too busy throwing popcorn at the TV screen , hoping a piece would go through the screen and lodge in Van Damme 's eye , get infected , and cause him to stop making movies . If you think that makes perfect sense , this movie is right for you .	-1
I feel this is one of those movies that everybody calls a classic just because they would n't dare go against it . Well , I will . Except for the hilarious opening , with Judy Holiday trying to kill her husband , I just did n't think this movie was that funny . The dialogue between Hepburn and Tracy is amusing , but not laugh-out-loud funny . Some may disagree , I know . But watch this movie not thinking it 's a famous grand comedy , and you may find that it 's not really all that funny . I do n't know ... . it could just be me . But be warned ! For a good Hepburn film , see Bringing Up Baby . For a good Tracy film , see Inherit the Wind . For a good movie about Bruce Campbell fighting zombies , see Army of Darkness .	-1
This was billed as a comedy but most of the jokes do n't age well at all . They belong in the `` may raise a smile here and there '' category but you 'll rarely find yourself capable of raising even a polite laugh throughout . The only `` joke '' that I thought was good was when Kip tells Amanda that lawyers should never marry lawyers because it eventually leads to more lawyers . Otherwise , it 's just another one of the arguments for equality of the sexes which I found boring and barely entertaining . I you want to find a good film with both Hepburn and Tracy doing an excellent acting job together you 'll have to look for `` Guess Who 's Coming To Dinner '' which ironically happens to be Tracy 's last film . As for this film , it does n't age well and I found myself impatiently waiting for it to end.To make things worse , this DVD version has n't been restored and so picture imperfections abound throughout the film where we frequently get an irritating black circle that keeps popping up around the top right hand corner of the screen in addition the the white spots everywhere else . The sound quality is very , very poor as well and coupled with no Special Features worth talking about as well makes this a poor value proposition indeed.If you are a die-hard Hepburn/Tracy fan and still want to get this farce then I would recommend waiting for a much better restored version to surface . As it is here , I would n't recommend this DVD as worthy of being a coaster for your coffee cup.Not recommended !	-1
First of all let me say Katharine Hepburn is my favorite actor of all time . Now let me say how much I despised this movie . I had high hopes for this film since I like Judy Holliday and Jean Hagen , however i can not begin to describe to you how ludicrous this film is . If you have not seen this film save yourself see any other Katharine Hepburn film , or read a book , just do n't watch this film . The plot is boring and contrived , and although this film is trying to make a statement about equal rights for women I think it fails . Katharine Hepburn relies too much on Spencer Tracy and the end of the film is a complete let down .	-1
This is one of my top 20 , desert isle , favorite movies . Gibson , Weaver , Hunt , Weir , composer Maurice Jarre ( with a track by Vangelis ) , are all marvelous . It 's an adult romance , with conflicting desires ( `` All is clouded by desire , Arjuna , '' Billy recites to Guy ) , political obligations , and personal ambitions . Add to that , Weir directs this film as if the protagonist is passing through a dream , echoing the film 's allusions to the wayang , Indonesian shadow plays , retelling myths as dreamlike performances.Just bought this disc on closeout at Wal-Mart ( unopened , sealed by the manufacturer ) . Alas , this release is mislabeled by Warner Bros. as containing an English stereo track . FALSE ADVERTISING ! The Dolby Digital track is only one channel ( as well as a French mono and Spanish mono tracks ) . Doubly disappointing because the soundtrack , and Jarre 's music , were lush and vivid on this film . This DVD release ( part number 65068 ) also states it contains pan 'n scan STANDARD as well as WIDESCREEN versions on the disc . The DVD only has a 16:9 anamorphic widescreen version . This is n't Amazon 's fault , but something I will take up with Warner Bros. directly . Buyer beware ... .	-1
The film is great , the DVD completely outdated and the film in desperate need of a new HD transfer . Hopefully soon on HD disc . This transfer is 90s garbage . Not much better than VHS .	-1
A particular Elvis fan favorite ? C'mon ! I 'm a huge Elvis fan , but this lousy film is in no way better than his previous films , except for the aspect of eye candy for the guys ... in the form of Ann Margret . She is definitely the star of this movie , and it 's quite obvious that the director purposely exploited Margret 's beautiful face and figure to overcompensate for the terrible script . It starts off interesting enough , albeit quite corny in places ( especially in the songs ) , but I expected that and accepted it for what it was . However , the story just gets weaker and weaker , until the end where the time span between the climax and the end of the movie is about 30 seconds . And absolutely no twists or turns in the plot to make it interesting ... just blah , the end . Just an awful movie , sorry.I really like Jailhouse House and King Creole -- those were great flicks , and not just compared to Elvis 's other movies . Even Blue Hawaii was much better than Viva Las Vegas . 4-1/2 stars as an overall rating ? ? ? Unbelievable . I guess all 4-1/2 stars go to Ann-Margret rather than the movie in general . If you want to salivate over a young , hot Ann-Margret , I recommend this movie . If you want an overall good movie , you wo n't find it here .	-1
Terrible music . Elvis Presley started out with soul and these movies just sucked the very essence of his being out of him . Ann Margaret was too talented for this script also .	-1
Ryan ( Mario Yedida ) is a 12-year-old boy with a bad leg who is bullied by the high school football champion . His only friend is a Chinese cook ( Dennis Lun ) , Ming , who tells him stories about warriors who fight for honor . One night , the boy accepts a foolish initiation dare , only to find himself transported to a mystical land called Tao , inhabited by strange creatures and human beings . The life springs of this world have been all but mined by the evil warlord Komodo ( Angus MacFadyen ) , and only one of them , reigned by wise Master Chung , remains . The only ones who can protect this world are the titular heroes -- human-sized kangaroos ( I swear , I 'm not making this up ) who kick , punch , swish , and swipe , kung-fu style whenever they are in action . But the warriors themselves have been separated because one of them broke a vow never to kill , and it seems as though the only way to stop Komodo is a manuscript which Ryan received from the aforementioned cook . But with the latter relic in Komodo 's hands , it wo n't be easy.This 1997 fantasy action flick should have made a pretty good family movie , but unfortunately it falls very , very short of its mark . Most critics have accused WARRIORS OF VIRTUE for ripping off STAR WARS , THE WIZARD OF OZ , and THE NEVERENDING STORY combined , and elements of all three stories are obvious for trivia buffs . That itself is not the problem ; the real issue is that the screenplay comes across as rushed , with sudden shifts in tone and plot that feel erratic and unnatural . It also comes across as rather childish , particularly in the use of profanity . One scene , in particular , uses an obscene phrase for laughs in a rather distasteful manner . Another happens earlier in the picture when the bully says to Ryan `` Did you say something or did you fart ? '' There 's also a lot of parts that feel very unexplained , although this could come across as part of the aforementioned tone shifting problem.Then there 's the characterizations , who are pretty much as cardboard cut as one would get . The warriors themselves ( subtitled the `` Rooz '' ) are rather indistinguishable in personality ( despite some exposition provided by Master Chung on each of them ) , and as such , come across as lifeless stiffs . The only time they come to life is when they are in action , but even then , there is something about them that is not particularly convincing . They look more like donkeys instead of kangaroos and their mouths are badly lip-synched to their voiceovers . Ryan could have been a compelling protagonist , but the script casts him in rather cliche territory , and as such , he never really comes across as sympathetic as he could be . It 's not Yedida 's fault ; he does the best he can , but he hardly gets much to do in the role . Komodo had the potential to be an interesting villain : he 's alternatively seductive and psychopathic , but he spends most of the time bellowing and mugging the camera to be truly menacing . Much of that can be attributed to MacFadyen ; he chomps on every scene he 's in with such exaggerated craziness -- much more than he can swallow -- that he quickly takes Komodo into self-parody territory . His climactic showdown with the Rooz ( where he shifts into five clones ) is particularly embarrassing ( `` Warriors , come out and PLAAAAY ! '' he screams in a campy tone , shortly after blubbering like a monkey ; way to kill any sense of genuine terror ) .There is one character who potentially emerges as believable ( a girl named Elysia , who is torn between siding with the good and being seduced by Komodo 's charisma ) , but the script quickly discards her without providing much of a chance for her to develop into a compelling personality . In all fairness , Marley Shelton does the best she can , but her actual role feels very underdeveloped . Furthermore , Elysia 's sudden switch to the dark side comes completely out of nowhere , even if her actions are motivated by her brother 's death . The best performer in the film is the Chinese cook played by Dennis Lun , who gives a warm charisma to his character . He also does an admittingly skillful karate-cooking stunt -- arguably more exciting than the actual fight scenes in the film . Sadly , he disappears after his opening part , which is a shame , Lun 's presence is arguably one of the strongest parts of the film.Speaking of the fight scenes , therein lies another problem with WARRIORS OF VIRTUE ; for some reason , Ronny Yu decides to film the fight sequences in slow motion . This could have been an interesting technique , but the problem is that he uses it CONSTANTLY , to the point where it both becomes tiresome and even makes matters confusing . It 's choppy on the eyes as well . I was especially baffled by the scene where Komodo suddenly becomes weakened after mortally wounding Master Chung in a fight -- even the explanation that the use of his energy drains his powers momentarily as a result of mythology such as `` to take a life , you lose a part of yourself '' is n't very clear at all . The special effects also feel very shoddy , despite being filmed on an elaborate budget of $ 35 million.I hate to sound like I 'm coming down on this film , because I honestly wanted to enjoy WARRIORS OF VIRTUE . That said , I did find some saving graces . One of them is Peter Pau 's cinematography ; despite the aforementioned jerky stop-motion issue , the actual visuals are rich and quite haunting , especially the world of Tao itself . The shifting angles during the kung fu sequences is also a haunting touch . ( The film was directed by Ronny Yu , a Hong Kong veteran of kung fu flicks , which explains much of the influence of the action here . ) Then there 's Don Davis ' score ; it 's gorgeous and breathtaking , warranting a listen on its own . It 's nothing like the composer 's later work for THE MATRIX , but it 's a symphony that deserves a listen.WARRIORS OF VIRTUE had the potential to be passable family fare ; even with the arguments that it comes across like it 's channeling TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES in its approach with a mixture of MIGHTY MORPHIN ' POWER RANGERS , a certain charm can overshadow that . Sadly , the scripting , directing , and acting faults ultimately bring it down to a `` nothing to write home about '' kind of film . It does provide some great cinematography and moments of imagination , but otherwise , it 's only so-so .	-1
I 'm sorry , but I absolutely hated this film . I can see that the people who made this film were inspired by Eastern philosophy ( using the five Chinese elements instead of the four Greek ones ) but this movie was just a total wreck . The one female Warrior is presented stereotypically , with flowers and everything . It was obvious she was just the token female character and nothing more , and the villain was downright laughable , and the whole 'virtue ' thing is overplayed . This film is so cheesy I could slice it and put it on my crackers .	-1
... so I rented and watched it again -- and I was every bit as bored and unimpressed as I remembered feeling after having watched it the first time ! Having read this book more than once ( it is my favorite Thomas Hardy book , and one of my favorite books of all time ) , and having seen both filmed versions , I have to say that this version ( with Alan Bates , Julie Christie and Peter Finch ) can not hold a candle to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre remake , released in 1998 , with Nathaniel Parker , Paloma Baeza and Nigel Terry.This Bates/Christie version was a great disappointment to me . Julie Christie was too old for the part of Bathsheba , did not fit Hardy 's description of her at all , and has never impressed me as much of an actress -- an opinion which has only been substantiated by her high-school-calibre performance in this film -- a MAJOR casting faux pas ! ( and a slap on the hand to the makeup artist who made this supposed 19th-century character even more farcical by piling on the makeup until she looked like a Vogue cover girl , rather than the mistress of Weatherbury Farm ) .Peter Finch 's performance , as Boldwood , was admirable ( actually the best of the film , in my opinion ) , but just did not elicit the strong feeling of empathy from me , as Nigel Terry did in the Masterpiece Theatre version . In all fairness , Finch did not seem to have as much screen time , so character development was lacking.The greatest surprise to me , in regard to this film , was that I also felt the same about Alan Bates ' performance as Gabriel Oak -- he just did not convey the emotions and the quality of Oak 's character , as described by Hardy in the book , and I found his portrayal to be PAINFULLY bland and boring . He seemed as though he was reading his lines straight off a teleprompter -- emotion and warmth were virtually non-existent ! ( a STRIKING contrast to Nathaniel Parker 's sensitive , powerful , heart-wrenching portrayal of Oak in the 1998 film ) .Part of the blame would have to be shared by the director of this version -- the actors APPEARED to be acting , and neither they , nor the director , seemed to have a firm grasp or understanding of the explicit emotions and personalities of the characters , which Hardy had gone to great effort and detail to describe in the book.I highly recommend to anyone who has seen only this version -- or to anyone who has never seen either version -- that you rent or buy the 1998 Masterpiece Theatre film , which is truer to Hardy 's book ( although some changes were made in that adaptation also , due to time constraints , it was n't nearly as & quot ; choppy & quot ; as this one ) , and is a quality production in every way , and brilliantly acted , from the main players right down through the supporting cast .	-1
I 'm not normally one to complain about movies but thought I 'd go out of my way to warn people of this terrible , terrible movie.It dragged on for ( what seemed to be ) forever , was not funny and was lacking any sort of direction.I 'm normally a fan of Billy Crystal and usually find him funny and quite entertaining . In this movie however he was nothing short of irritating . Talk about a career killer.Seriously folks , save your money for something decent .	-1
My wife recently found on Netflix Child 's Play 2 but this one was not listed , and both Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus did not have this . Amazon had it to rent , and after seeing it this time , I told my wife , & # 34 ; This is so stupid. & # 34 ; A man 's soul trapped inside a plastic doll that somehow has the strength of The Hulk , is able to bite and run like an Olympic athlete . And it 's not because I am older , as It by Stephen King brought an unexpected chill up my spine when I saw it again back in 2011 . Garbage , pure trash , so unless you know someone who has this , do n't even bother spending your money on it . You 'd do better to turn off the lights , hide in your closet and wait for someone to come home and jump out , & # 34 ; BOO ! & # 34 ; Even if you get clocked in the eye , the reaction will be better than watching this .	-1
Ok , we all know dvd is quickly going he way of VHS and if you are like me you kick yourself every time you waste your money buying a `` has been '' format , I buy this one thinking `` no way they will blu this one '' then a couple weeks later the blu comes out ... oh well . Fun Movie though .	-1
In a slow paced overacted snoozefest that does n't feel like it 's going anywhere . I turned it off so I cant tell you if there were thrills and spills after the first half an hour .	-1
`` I am the feminine in you , Carlsen '' sayeth the space girl . Judging by all the shouting , bullying and hysteria displayed by Carlsen throughout the film , I can well believe it.I saw this saturday night in the West End when it was first released . The entire cinema was in uproar . Of course , I would have prefered to have paid money to see a good movie but I feel sort of privileged to have witnessed the Plan 9 of our generation . You notice in the first few minutes that everything seems slightly 'off ' . Then when Bukovsky makes his very long dash down the various corridors of the 'European Space Research Institute ' , theatrically pulling each door open as he goes , you sense something special in the making . By the time the cast decamps to Thurlstone asylum , Lifeforce takes an appropriate turn for the lunatic which it thankfully does not recover from . The film 's peculiar timing will have you in fits of giggles . Just before Carlsen 's carousel with Dr Armstrong gets underway , Lamson walks into the room centre frame . I do n't know why it is funny , it 's just the film 's peculiar genius . When all hell breaks loose he enters the room a second time and his expression is just priceless . Casting helps . Aubrey Morris , playing the Home Secretary , has a strange expression on his face even when nothing 's happening.Peter Firth , playing an SAS Colonel whose effeminate and mannered announceation gets more worried glances than those aimed at the vampires , confesses to being a natural voyeur . I thought people joined the SAS to get where the action is , not to enjoy standing back and watching , but it is a D notice situation after all . After liberating Britain from the energy sucking vampires , I can well imagine Colonel Caine behind enemy lines in the Falklands , blowing up railway tracks and the like . Job done , he returns to Oscar Tango Brava Two Zero Zero base camp for a debriefing followed by a bottle of mineral water and a fist full of Barbara Streisand CD 's which to his disappointment he already owns . His pantomime dame reaction to the sudden appearance of a giant bat long forgotten by the tired regiment . Lets face it , becoming an actor is a risky business . But when you see Steve Railsback bury his face into Mathilda May 's bosom ( the only time in the movie he actually shuts up ) , you rather regret your decision to become a frogspawn breeder.Ps . Love the Union Jack patches on the astronaut 's boiler suits .	-1
This is one of the most truly execrable sci-fi/horror flicks ever made ( and I generally love bad sci-fi movies ) . It 's badly written , badly edited , and the acting is truly awful . The special effects are so-so and the plot makes no sense whatsoever . There are only two reasons to buy this video : to watch a beautiful woman walking around naked , including full-frontal nudity ( sexism alert : the handsome male vampires have their naughty bits blurred out ) , and to see what Patrick Stewart had to suffer through before becoming Jean-Luc Picard .	-1
This film does n't belong on anyone 's top 100 . The humor is obvious . It is uncreative . The gags are n't funny . The best thing about this film , and in fact the only thing good about it , is Marilyn Monroe . She 's adorable and beautiful . Aside from that , there is no reason to spend two hours with this mediocrity .	-1
Dialog must have sounded smart and fresh when made . It seems pretty dated now . Shocking behavior during that period seems pretty tame now .	-1
I have been born in a very small village and have always hated big cities . I do not understand the city mind and living . The greatness of Annie Hall was lost for me . It was a bit difficult for me to identify with 5 ft Woody Allen being 6-5 ft muscular country-boy . How about City Slickers ? I have been riding on a horse as a young boy . That was a great feeling . No wonder , then , that I began to enjoy traditional westerns . So I decided to try this film . It was shown in Finnish TV . Of course I checked its ratings in IMDB and Amazon . These were full of glowing reviews . This film was supposed to be very funny . The film began with some rather poor jokes about family life and parties and half-witted men with personal crises . I did not like any of the main characters . Were these typical big city men ? If I do not like the main people , a lot is lost for me . Maybe this film gets better when the trio leaves the city and stars to drive cows , I thought . Soon I noticed that I am not slick enough to enjoy their discussions about sex and women . It was great to see Jack Palance , but it was not enough . After seeing about half of it I gave up . I did not enjoy this film at all . Why watch , then ? Perhaps I was too hasty , because the reviews tell that these mixed-up men might learn something about life . But if that is great comedy , the skill of making good comedies has been totally lost . Of course there is an alternative interpretation . My taste is about 40 years behind city slickers . That may be the reason I mainly watch films made 40 and even 80 years ago . - Thus my rating concerns about half of this film . Remember , I do like American films . I could easily list 10-20 five star films . The second star is for Palance .	-1
Like others have indicated I also have a beef with Amazon on this title . First they sent me the standard edition in the standard edition packaging while charging for the Collector 's edition . It was returned upopened and then they sent me the so-called Collector 's edition . Only the case was the collector 's ediiton , the disc inside was the original release with none of the special features . Is this an accident or is it deliberate ? It certainly happens enough to raise the question . It ssems like the line between doing business and out right dishonesty is getting razor thin . I recently purchased two blu-ray players from Amazon and both were defective . In the future I will continue to purchase from Amazon.com but only from selling partners .	-1
Yes , this movie is broken . It ` s boring , dragging and sleep inducing.The acting is bland . The dialogues are insipid . The pace drags and drags . I agreed with reviewer , Steven Kuroiwa , when he said this was the worst movie of Marlon Brando . I ` m glad I did not rent it . I borrowed it from the library instead .	-1
This video has too much nonsense and too much confusion of what is supposedly happening . This videowas n't worth watching , and I did not watch all of it .	-1
I love Marlon Brando , I consider him to be the greatest actor ever . He was/is my favorite actor . But I must be honest about this movie . It 's not good . I barely have words to describe how disappointingly bad this movie is . The pace of the film is off ( the movie itself is off ) , as well as , the tone . The script leaves much to be desired and the editing is perfunctory at best . On the whole the movie is boring , but the scenes with Brando provide SOME comic relief . But it 's like watching two different movies at once . The movie seems as if it is patched together with a lot of puzzle pieces missing . It was frustrating to watch . And the ending scene with the horses and carrots was beyond bizzare and Brando 's bonnet scene was simply disturbing . I sat through the movie wondering if Brando was high , or still recovering from the nervous breakdown he had after Last Tango in Paris , because I know that movie virtually destroyed him psychologically and had a profound effect on how he chose his future movie projects . I do n't know what he was trying to accomplish in this film ( if he was trying to accomplish anything at all ) or if this is the direction the director wanted to go in . Whatever the answer this is not a movie I will be watching again .	-1
I watched this movie a few days ago at a time of night when infomercials are most prevalent . I began watching the film with no real expectations , but still happy that I might have stumbled upon some cinematic gem at 2 or 3 in the morning . But as the movie progressed I could only justify my further viewing of it as the choosing of a lesser `` evil '' . Sadly , this movie joins a long list of other films where a cornucopia of talent was assembled , but the result was ... . So many of the actors in this film are wasted on the material given them , and the only perfomance that really makes an impact ( Brando 's ) is simply laughable . One can catch a glimpse of the sad state Brando 's career will ultimately reach while watching this film . I 'm not even going to get started on the dull , meandering plot . Basically , just do n't watch this movie , at least if there 's something else better on ... like a Juiceman infomercial .	-1
Harris reprises his weak and tepid role of an 1800 's gentleman who ca n't stomach modern life in England so he goes back to the Plains to find his adopted tribe of Sioux Indians . He finds them on the verge of extinction , starvation and he is there to lead them to new hope , which means bowing to his leadership . Why the Sioux did n't kill him in the first film goes beyond reason . More silly stuff from hippies in the 1970 's in this second installment of the wildly popular but empty & # 34 ; A Man Called Horse & # 34 ; saga . Look for a psychedelic scene where Harris is & # 34 ; behind & # 34 ; naked while emerged in color shots of eagles flying in the sky .	-1
Went to see `` An American in Paris '' last night on a large screen ( which squeezed the image tight ) with 1000 other people and a grating unidirectional sound system blaring as if it had been turned up for 600 hearing aids . Some of the audience applauded after each of the film production numbers . I forgot just what an awful film this is - wonderful only for its costumes and set design . There 's virtually no story ( Alan Jay Lerner ! ) , no acting , no continuity , no feeling , and much dubbing , with Gene Kelly playing his usual aggressive , manic , I-deserve-it self . His choreography though Olympic-sized is dull - the tap dancing looks ridiculous on the fak e '' Parisian '' streets - and would do an army battalion proud.No chemistry exists between Leslie Caron and Kelly , and Gershwin 's music , except for the Oscar Levant interlude , is never given its due . One song , in fact ( `` By Strauss '' ) is unbearable , musically . Only Levant , Technicolor and the inventive French Impressionist-themed sets save the film . It 's hard to imagine how or why it was made . `` Midnight in Paris '' is about 100 times better . Despite this film 's legendary status ( why , why ? ) it 's Minelli - obsessed with surfaces - at his most embarrassingly shallow .	-1
If you would like some great entertainment then get the original - The Philadelphia Story with Cary Grant , Katharine Hepburn , and James Stewart . You wo n't be dissapointed .	-1
This movie has one of the best looking females EVER ... Phoebe Cates in it ! If that 's not enough to make you want this film , your dead from the waist down ! Ok , the movie is dorky and laughable at times , but you 'll be too busy drooling at the skimpy costumes she wears , the naked waterfall scene ! The naked underwater scenes ! Enough said.. Own this film ! And pray to God it finally get 's released onto an American DVD release . There is a Japanese company doing a DVD release of this ( She 's real popular in Japan ! ) but it 's a region 2 DVD so unless you have a region free player , your outta luck . Also , not sure of the quality either .	-1
This film asks the question : what could you do if America was invaded ? Do not expect a realistic answer from this film ; it seems to have been made as scare tactics for the 1984 election . ( No pictures of a wandering bear . ) It is possible for people in a mountainous terrain to resist an invader ( Yugoslavia , Afghanistan ) . This requires a hardened people used to living in rude conditions , and the support of the civilian population . This film does not mention the problems of supplies : food , medicine , arms , ammunition , replacements , and intelligence.This film is so naive as to be funny . Invasion by the Cuban and Nicaraguan armies ! Who could believe that ? Maybe those who think Houston is the capital of Texas . Could an amateur band of irregular forces conquer a larger force of trained and disciplined soldiers ? Resistance during WW Two involved sabotage and intelligence gathering on occupying forces ( France ) . The exception was the Yugoslav Red Army and the Soviet Partisans who operated as military units.A box of food falls off a truck , and is gathered by these resistance fighters . This leads to their attack by `` flying tanks '' . Did n't they learn about the Trojan Horse in High School ? The fate of this band recalls the stories of outlaws in the Old West . Placing most of the scenes in a rural setting suggests a low budget . The film ends ambiguously , as if they ran out of ideas or money . It makes guerrilla warfare seem like a weekend of hunting .	-1
This movie was , is and always will be one of the biggest jokes of a movie , an insult to the intelligence of anyone with half a brain , including so called `` military experts '' who stand by the feasibility of this horse dung . Thank God we have the likes of Jennifer Grey and Patrick `` beefcake '' Swayze to save the day ! He and his `` team mates '' chase what amounts to the Keystone Cops invaders , who for an invading force show all the genius of the Marx Brothers in `` Duck Soup . '' Thank God the invading coalition was nice enough to allow the boys to visit their dad in a prison camp before letting them go back and arm up . That this movie actually frightened anyone at it 's `` realistic possibilities '' shows you why Eisenhower said , `` beware the military industrial complex . '' Only thing wosre than a loopy , paranoid gun owner , is a loopy , paranoid military . Boy , if this movie scared tham , I imagine `` Top Gun '' had them running for cover , and oil to cover themselves with in case they take up a volleyball game of course . Do n't let the `` all-star cast '' fool you . Lots of early efforts by future brand names look like early efforts . I watch almost anything Lea Thompson 's in . This is one I skip . The Schlocky Patrick Swayze shows why he was chosen for an even cheesier role in the extreeeeeeemely over rated `` Dirty Dancing . '' Each movie i mentioned ranks ( literally ) in my top 10 list of over rated drek as far as movies from the 80s , but Red Dawn laid the groundwork . This movie is essentially Walt Disney goes to war . These kids would have been dead in days , but hey , thank got they were able to obtain guided missles , grenades , automatic weapons and infinite amounts of shells to outsmart those stupid commies . Hammy , corney , cheesy ... there just ai n't enough adjectives to denounce this stinker . By comparison , our `` liberation '' of Grenada looks like Normanday .	-1
Without question , probably the silliest piece of dreck I 've sat through in a long time . Never mind the terrible overacting , the lack of script , or the tedious sameness of the `` action . '' Where is even the remotest sense of credibility ? A fantasy movie like this is supposed to make you at least almost sort of believe it coulda , woulda , mighta happened . This one , no . Where is the rest of the ginormous US military ? I suppose it was off fighting elsewhere , as we are led to believe by the gap-filling dialogue delivered about halfway into the movie by the shot-down American pilot . The sets are just too fake . The bazookas too unreal . The Rooskies and the others too stereotyped . It is a hoot to watch these very young future stars `` acting '' in this mess . Give it a laugh , if you must .	-1
Russian/Cuban forces in the 1980s parachute into a small Colorado town and begin eliminating the inhabitants . ( Really - Russia would need/want Cuba 's help , they 'd start in a small town in Colorado and bother exterminating its populace ? ) Patric Swazye and friends grab a pickup truck , stock up on supplies , and head for the hills . Meanwhile , the town 's remaining men are held at the local drive-in . Then the teens emerge as a vengeance-seeking commando unit known as 'Wolverines ' and rescue the town from Communist occupation - after Washington , D.C. Kansas City , Omaha , etc . were already obliterated . Sometime later , the U.S. drives the invaders out , per the film 's epilogue . Laughable.The 'good news ' is that , per others , this version is n't as bad as its 2012 remake .	-1
OK , so I keep hearing about how great this movie is and , other than the 'message ' it was trying to send , the movie is HORRIBLE . While it does show the drama of a people who are used to the joys of freedom trying to cope under tyranny , mass executions , the loss of family , etc , it does it in a truly terrible way . The terrible acting , horrible action scenes , and the HORRENDOUS music score tear at your nerves the whole time.The worst part is everyone screaming , `` It was great for its time ! '' No , no it was n't . Just because it 's a movie you can reminisce about from when you were younger does n't mean it was a good movie . When I saw it back in the '80s I saw how cheesy it was , and that has n't changed.Again , the message was the only good point in the movie . How our own government , even when they are trying to 'help ' us , can set us up for failure ( ie : Gun registration being used to hunt down people who had the ability to resist corruption and tyranny ) and how fleeting our alliances and worldwide friends can be ( ie : NATO/Europe failing to help us despite being friends and allies ) .Should you see the movie ? Sure , why not ? Should you expect this to be an amazing movie ? No !	-1
This movie is a & quot ; classic & quot ; among the fans ( for terrible reasons I must add ) :1- It 's just a bad cartoon , not a Bond Movie.2- Moore did it only for the money . Period.3- It has the ALL time worst Bond girl ever . She played a CIA agent if the CIA was ruled by Forrest Gump or Rain Man.4- Rio de Janeiro as it appears on this movie is not the REAL Rio de Janeiro . It was an example of poor research , like Santos Dumont Airport named San Pedro Airport ( ? ? ? ) .5- Bond producers did the impossible : turned Hugo Drax , one of the most Fleming 's interesting villains into one of the worst of the Bond series . Let 's see if they fix the error putting Drax personality on the new villain of DAD.It 's the worst , folks . It 's simple as that , ok ?	-1
I 'm sorry , but this is in no way , shape or form a Bond movie . It is a Roger Moore movie , it has his puns , but lacks the style that makes James Bond the greatest spy of film history . If your image of James Bond is Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan , Moonraker is not for you . focus on the fan favorites of Connery ( Dr No , From Russia with Love , Goldfinger , Thunderball , You Only Live Twice ) and Brosnan ( Goldeneye , The World is Not Enough ) and you will appreciate the character that is Bond . This movie , this strange , bizarre movie `` Moonraker '' is lucky it never made `` Mystery Science Theater 3000 '' .	-1
This was the worst movie I ever watched . I kept watching it thinking there would be SOME moment of redemption , something worth the cost of the rental ! I wished at the end that I had given up on it as quickly as the characters gave up on themselves . I think the character Nicholas Cage played was as addicted to self-pity as he was to alcohol . Okay , maybe there are people out there who let themselves get this bad , but do the rest of us really need to watch it for 2 hours ? I could n't believe this movie won so many awards .	-1
I generally steer away from a Disney movie . And Mary Poppins for the Grandkids ? I 'll leave the room . Lifetime channel where all men are beasts and women are out on the front lines trying to preserve civilization . Keep it . But I also draw the line at 100 million dollar films that want to tell me that life is hard . I have learned this . And I 've also learned that alcohol , in some hands , kills . It kills the person who drinks it and it often kills the people around him or her . It is as much a disease as cancer , MS or emphysema . I do n't need a brilliant actor to show me what 's under the rock . I 've seen under the rock . It is n't very pretty . Nor should you.That Nick Cage wins an oscar and Shue should have , should not be the criteria for this novel turned movie about two weak people who lacked the courage to turn their lives around . That 's the movie . Human courage in the face of adversity . Failing . Losing . Not the ultimate giving up . Not the peddling of your flesh and your soul . I missed the gun at the head of Cage or the noose around the neck of Shue , urging them to continue degrading themselves . No . The criteria for this movie should be John O'Brien , the author , who committed suicide before the movie was completed.Sorry . I do n't get it . Struggled with it . I do n't know why people would be interested in it . Tell me in 20 years if it 's brilliant , or just a lot of Hollywood people jumping on the ooing and aahhing band wagon . People ought to come to their senses . 1 star . Larry Scantlbury	-1

I 've lived in the suburbs all of my life , and I would n't live anywhere else . As I look back over the years , some neighbors were quirky and most experienced some form of difficulty in their lives , but most were very decent people . Was there a secret `` dark underbelly '' to the 'burbs ? Not really , except for the dads who hid Playboys in their offices , couples who divorced , and parents who aborted their unborn children , deemed `` defective '' through amniocentisis.In fact , as often as not , most people that I remember lived lives of quiet heroism , not desperation . Does this film reveal anything besides a diseased mind ? None that I can think of . Like most celebrated modern artists , intellectuals , and writers , Lynch 's work probably reflects his private vices more than any existing reality.Sure , David Lynch can present intriguing , dark and mysterious images . But in the end they 're just that , a string of intriguing , dark and mysterious images , ultimately leading nowhere . If the idea of walking through a dead-end labyrinth appeals to you , then you 'll like this movie .	-1
This movie comes from a different time . Our culture has changed so much that it just is not as relavent anymore .	-1
After witnessing the empty spectacle and failed futuristic warnings that permeate much of Norman Jewison 's & quot ; Rollerball , & quot ; I 've come to one conclusion : either you 'll be enthralled by the director 's eerie envisioning of a world in which no one makes their own decisions , or you wo n't believe a word of it.The film is a cross-stitch of science fiction , action , and human drama , all pasted together in what could resemble a construction paper school project made by an elementary school student , with little care devoted to its character development or central message . What we 're left with once the film reaches its drawn-out conclusion is a bland , unmoving , lifeless piece of filmmaking that desperately tries to be quietly powerful , but never succeeds.The film 's opening sequence is the true test of patience , serving as the defining moment when audience members will make the choice to stick it out or just abandon the concept entirely . It introduces us to the sport of rollerball , which , we are told , is a blend of football , motorcross and hockey , providing an outlet for the angst felt by the majority of citizens in a world where corporations have taken power over previous political rule.Some questions arise from such facts : how does this game provide a vent for such furor if the players in the game are heralded by the corporations who are seemingly the cause of their hardships ? Do they have any hardships at all ? What is the corporation , and what are its intentions and laws ? Also , what are the rules of the game ? What are its guidelines ? For what purpose do people partake of such a sport , other than to cheer at the senseless and brutal violence that they bear witness to ( and they call today 's movies violent ) ? At the center of this surrealism is revered rollerballer Jonathan ( James Caan ) , known by rollerball fans and the corporate heads to be the best of the best when it comes to this sport . Underneath his wallow in fame and fortune , Jonathan has a distinct love for the game , as well as a longing for his long-departed wife , who was taken from him by the corporation to serve as the wife of an executive.Soon after his latest bout , Jonathan is informed that the corporation intends for him to depart from the sport of rollerball in a television appearance that will air around the world . Defiant of those who would try to prevent him from doing what he loves , he presses on with the game , despite the inclusion of a new set of rules and pressure from all around to do what everyone else thinks is sensible.This also bring about a second set of questions : again , why does the corporation so strongly wish for him to leave the sport ? The movie explains it as a fear of his growing popularity , but nothing in-depth is ever revealed . Also , if the corporation is as powerful as they are portrayed , would they not have the ability to remove him without giving him a choice ? Perhaps , but this would prevent the inclusion of the film 's tedious third act , in which Jonathan does some soul-searching to ponder life in such a hostile world. & quot ; Rollerball 's & quot ; main problem lies within its inept storytelling . There 's not a single moment in the film that provides its audience a reason to understand its so-called message about the future of our world , much less believe in its main character 's struggle to prove his aggressors wrong . The overall feel of the film is empty and listless , devoid of the emotion or plausibility needed to sell us on its ideals .	-1
Not good.Soylent Greenoffers a better rendering of futuristic corporation-run society , andThe Running Manhits the sweet spot of ultimate reality gaming . Either one is a more satisfying film experience than Rollerball ; you could even make it a double-feature.Blade Runneris of course the classic dystopian vision.Fans of James Caan will be better served byThief . Here he seems less sure of Jewison 's direction , less sure of himself , even . On the other hand , John Houseman ( `` They make money the old fashioned way ... they earn it . '' ) is quite good.Nice reduction in ambient nose in the championship game , but it 's too little , too late , in my opinion . Tons of worthless dialog and plenty of unanswered questions . Maybe I 'll give thebooka try sometime .	-1
We started to watch this movie but it did n't hold our interest and we cut it short and watched something else . [ Half Light ]	-1
This movie is very well acted and it held my interest throughout . Donald Sutherland 's character is insipid , which is , I suppose , what he is supposed to be , so I ca n't hold that against the actor . Stockard Channing is very real in her role , and Will Smith basically carries the movie on his shoulders even though he is n't in all of the scenes . He plays the role of an insane young man who pretends to be Sidney Poitier 's son in order to wedge his way into the homes of wealthy people . He gives them quite a ride , and gives himself one as well . Obviously the story is farfetched , but not so farfetched as to be impossible . Perhaps someone from an inner city background could pull that off , though I doubt it . At the end we are informed that the Will Smith character is insane , as shown in a pathetic phone call from him to Stockard Channing in which he makes it clear that he actually believes himself to be who he is pretending to be . His deepest , and pathetic , desire is to be a member of that wealthy society.This is a 4 or 5 star performance that ran into one of my biggest pet peeves in theatre , thereby dropping it to only 2 stars . It failed to tie up loose ends and give us an ending . We are n't told how it all turned out . We are n't told if Will Smith is even alive at the end , and we 're led to believe he may have committed suicide . That 's too big a loose end to leave dangling . We are n't told if Stockard Channing is able to re-establish contact with him.If the movie industry was n't in the habit of doing that to us , I 'd perhaps consider it creative and original of them to leave us hanging on the ending , but they do it so often that it has become a cliche , and an annoying one . In that final scene , when Stockard Channing finally walks away from her empty shell of a husband , I realized that `` they were doing it again '' about the loose ends and failure to provide an ending , and I just said `` roll the credits '' because I knew they would . It was one of those scenes where they always roll the credits , in this case with Stockard Channing walking down a New York City street , away from her husband . It was such a predictable cliche.In their sorry attempt at being creative with the ending , all they did was fall into a timeworn and extremely uncreative cliche . You just want to slap the director for pulling that nonsense on us . We have just given the director a couple of hours of our leisure time , and in turn we just received a slap in the face ourselves , not told how the story ends , not told if the character we have grown to care about is dead or alive.Not good work . A fine movie ruined by a poor and unsatisfying and cliche ending .	-1
A highly affected couple drone on about their life with never-ending flashbacks . Intellectuals ( pseudo ) seem to see some deep messages an analogies in this stage play made into a movie . I was done when Stockard Channing discovers a very young Will Smithnaked and going at it with another guy in bed . Deep thoughts ?	-1
This movie is awful - so awful that you ca n't turn it off because you are amazed at how awful it is . Not even one single likable character in the entire movie . This movie is pure garbage . Maybe someday MST-3000 will have fun with it , if they ever sink that low . One star is much too good for this movie . Makes a great gag gift though .	-1
It will make me unpopular to say this , as if I am not already wildly unpopular , but this was a terrible and totally overrated movie . In light of Marlon Brando 's semi-recent death I thought it high time to see some of his best known works . Cited as a classic in many cases , at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release , this film was flat , left me dazed , it was useless . I hated it . It was strange , mumbling , sleazy . The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting , anyway-was mediocre at best . Where 's the story ? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered `` art '' and `` decent '' . To me , it was just a monumental waste of time , like roughly half of Bernardo Bertolucci 's work .	-1
Thank goodness for the actitivism on women actors part to protect their rights from abuse and exploitation in films . This movie is very depressing .	-1
As of 2006 , `` Last Tango In Paris '' should be left to the dustbin of history . Even if you 're a total Brando fanatic , you should n't have to subject yourself to this torturously slow film , which has no discernable point outside of its supposed shock value elements , which are only shocking because they 're so tastelessly crass and boring , making the film utterly dated . Brando 's character in the film feels miserable throughout , and I think I felt at least twice as miserable while watching . Even more annoying though are the laughably unconvincing scenes between Maria Schneider and Jean-Pierre L & eacute ; aud , the latter of whom turns in an utter ham act . After sludging through the first hour of this film , which drags on listlessly and at a snail 's pace , you find that you just do n't give a damn anymore what happens . Although I ca n't exactly give Brando a thumbs up for taking on this role , I place the blame for this atrocity squarely on Bernardo Bertolucci , who directed and co-wrote the screenplay -- having seen a bit of Bertolucci 's other work as well , it seems that this guy should have his filmmaking license revoked . About the best that can be said is that the picture quality of the film really is stunning , but even that ends up not being an advantage because it just makes the whole thing seem even more annoyingly 'arty ' and pretentious . `` Last Tango In Paris '' is a life-draining movie-watching experience that ca n't be recommended , period .	-1
The characters motivations are disgusting and the acting is poor . I decided to watch this film since its supposed to be a cult classic and everyone talks about how Brando did such a find job.Call me crazy but when watching a film I like to at least like one of the characters . Here I felt like I was at a party with a bunch of people I did n't like but could n't leave . Talk about No Exit.I guess some of you will like this film but unless you 're one of those bleeding heart , artsy farsty people I suggest you save yourself the pain of trying to watch this film .	-1
This move is good ( ? ) for misogynists and those with sophomoric brains . I remember when it first came out , but never saw it until now ... ca n't believe the hype that was made about it 40 years ago .	-1
The plot of the film is simple . The Marlon Brando Character is depressed over the death of his wife . He gives a performance of grief at the grave side . He goes to rent and apartment and meets the Maria Schneider character . He rapes the Maria Schneider character , but that okay , cause you know that women really like that sort of stuff.Maria and Marlon agree to meet , just for sex , no names at the apartment . Is this maybe Loehengrin and not a Bertolucci film ? Of course this makes tremendous sense . Marlon is middle aged and not to attractive . Maria is 20 something and drop dead gorgeous . Marlon also comes across as a self pitying dope who can not string two words together . In another scene he violently sodomizes Schiender . The plot of this film could only exist as a fantasy of a middle aged man.The climax of the film ( an expression one hesitates to use for a range of reasons ) is when the Brando character falls in love and wants to continue the relationship . Schnieder rejects him rather forcefully end of film.The film has sparse dialogue , Marlon looks dreadful overacts continually and one wonders how anyone took it seriously . Probably because it came out prior to the women & # 8217 ; s movement . It is hard to think of a contemporary director who would produce such a unrealistic portrayal of a female character .	-1
Back around '72 , when people were being conned into watching foreign art films and believing they were seeing something other than cinema verite ' vulgaire , this scatological piece of film movie garbage might have been `` It . '' Brando was a tremendous actor , but he must have been doing this one for lunch money . Schneider , who plays the 20 year old in bad need of a landscaper in her `` lower forty '' has all the acting range from A-B . Her boyfriend is a pseudo director twit , and perhaps the most moving performance in this cinema sin was given by the dead rat held up by Brando . Also , plot point . His wife is dead , they do an autopsy on her , and we find her back in her hotel bedroom surrounded with flowers ? Not very likely , although since this is a movie taking place in France , we need not consider the hygiene aspects too closely . Brando mumbles his way through this , and the only saving grace in this flick is the Gato Barbieri score .	-1
I remember that this film caused a big fuss when I was a kid , so I decided to check it out . Bad mistake . So bad I could n't even watch it to the end . No plot . Terrible acting . Do n't waste your time .	-1
The movie was unbelievable for two reasons : There actually were few gunfights in the Old West.Nobody but Burt could shoot straight.Should have called it Low Noon .	-1
Foxes is a coming of age drama about four teenage girls growing up in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles . It attempts to be a gritty behind the scenes look at the sex , drugs , and rock and roll of teenagers in the late 70 's , but it comes off more akin to another force feeding of aerosol cheese by director Adrian Lyne . Jodie Foster is like the den mother of the Foxes in question , and while she is always interesting in whatever role she is playing , this is a tremendous waste of her talents . She tries to manage the situations and solve all the problems of her three friends , but it is beyond her capability . While she seeks to control the personal lives of her friends , who they date , and so forth , what of her own love life ? The closest she comes to a love interest of her own is Brad , who is almost like a mascot for the Foxes . He is too cute and short to be taken seriously by Annie ( Cherie Currie from the all girl rock group The Runaways ) . He is also too cute to be taken seriously by the audience . The whole time he is onscreen you are thinking , Happy Days , Joanie Loves Chachi , and Charles in Charge . Mostly though you are thinking , what is Chachi doing in this movie that purports to be a gritty behind the scenes look at the secret lives of teenage girls ? Cherie Currie , as the stoner girl that Jeannie ( Jodie Foster ) is always trying to rescue , either from bad boys who get her drugged up for date rape , or from her psycho cop father , is a disappointment as an actress . You 'd think that a rock star from the legendary rock band The Runaways would have some stage presence , but sadly she is totally lacking in charisma . It is so hard to be sympathetic for such a shallow , stupid , and doomed character . They should have picked Joan Jett , if they needed someone from The Runaways so badly . Even Lita Ford , judging by her subsequent musical career , would have been a better choice.Another bad choice : Angel , the rock band , really added little to the film . Were they supposed to show the total lack of creativity and inspiration the youth of 1980 had to draw on ? If so , maybe it was a great choice . I do n't remember Angel at all , and judging by what I saw in Foxes , I am grateful for the memory lapse . Speaking of bad musical choices , though , they chose a couple of songs that were totally inappropriate , just really bland pop music that did n't seem to have anything whatsover to do with anything that was even happening in the film . It was as if they owed some songwriter a favor . Was it The Beckmeier Brothers ? There were some tunes by Angel that were lame , and lots of stuff by Giorgio Moroder . The only song that worked at all , and then only for a bit of late 70 's nostalgia , was `` More Than a Feeling '' by Boston.Finally , they slap in a totally gratuitous car/skateboard chase , and a totally contrived ending . This was a very ill conceived project . The only reason to watch it is if you are totally obsessed with Jodie Foster , like Hinckley , or if you just want to confirm what a rotten director Adrian Lyne is , has been , and will always be . Foxes is one of his early efforts and also one of his worst . A far better use of your time would be to watchValley Girl , which does n't aspire to be any more than a light hearted comedy , but is vastly more entertaining ; and has a great soundtrack featuring The Plimsouls ( who perform a song live ) , Josie Cotton , The Psychedelic Furs , Sparks , and Modern English . Plus , you get Nicolas Cage as a Hollywood ( the actual city , not as in Tinsel Town ) punk rocker.FILMS DIRECTED BY ADRIAN LYNNEFatal Attraction ( Special Collector 's Edition ) ( 1987 ) 9 1/2 Weeks ( 1986 ) Flashdance ( 1983 ) FILMS AND ROLES OF JODIE FOSTERNell ( 1994 ) ... .

This was made by director Adrian Lyne before his breakthrough with Flashdance , and features the same dreamy soft-porn lighting he would use in Fatal Attraction , Indecent Proposal and 9 1/2 Weeks . However whilst Lyne 's later titles had ideas that captured the public imagination , with themes of crime and punishment circa Cecil B DeMille , this first film suffers from a screenplay that goes nowhere , and interminable pacing . This take on teenagers in LA having a superior moral code to their parents is highlighted by Sally Kellerman describing her daughter Jodie Foster and her friends as & quot ; short 40 year olds , who look like kids but do n't act like 'em & quot ; . The tale centres on Foster 's friendship with 3 other schoolgirls and their efforts to create a & quot ; family & quot ; since their parents are either divorced , abusive or uncast . The group focuses on the drug-taking habits of the most put-upon , whose fate is practically predetermined by the TV movie standards of the narrative . As the natural leader of the group , presumably because she has more acting experience , this is one of Foster 's last child roles before she temporarily abandoned Hollywood for Yale and John Hinkley . It 's indicative of Lyne 's seeming indifference to his performers that he can even make Jodie Foster look bad , though she does yell back well at Kellerman . Kellerman herself is one of the mean adult figures , possibly given even worse material than a thuggish policeman father , and it 's a miracle that Lois Smith as another parent manages to invest some character in her brief appearance . The idea of casting Jodie Foster and Sally Kellerman as mother and daughter is probably Lyne 's most provocative contribution . Lyne came to work in the USA with a group of British directors who all graduated into film making via advertising , and he does present some early amusing observations of Hollywood oddball streetlife . This is about the only time the screenplay comes up with anything approaching wit - with the girls referring to a woman they see as weird - Mary Weirdo - then sing the Merry Widow waltz ; and one line about a pimp & quot ; He could hypnotise you like a cobra and the next thing you 're out on the boulevard dressed like the Pointer Sisters & quot ; . This film introduced the Janis Ian/Giorgio Moroder classic song & quot ; Fly Too High & quot ; but Lyne barely uses it , which considering the lyrics are apt to the theme , tells you how clueless Lyne is .	-1
The movie was terrible . Every time you thought something did n't happen is being very depressed . By the time you get to the end do n't really care what happens because it 's so lousy . And why would you go back to The guy that way . That you 're upset because you left because of how that he treated you ? Strange .	-1
unreal , unimaginable - old school day dream for someone - did not like the acting - both are capable of so much more	-1
Mickey Rourke and Kim Bassinger are caught in the spider 's web of a sado-masochistic affair . There is n't very much going on in the movie except a string of highly charged and seamy sex scenes . On the whole , the movie adds up to a big zero .	-1
What a disappointment . The book was not only better ( surprise surprise ) but oddly different . The only reason for two stars was that Mickey Rourke was easy on the eyes .	-1
9 1/2 WEEKS reminded me of that birds and bees joke . That 's where the Dad told the son about sex in very graphic terms , finishing by asking , & quot ; Have you got any questions ? & quot ; Then the kid says , & quot ; Yeh , Dad . How do you keep from laughing ? & quot ; Well , this movie was a little bit funny about the sex parts . A guy on a bar stool sort of blushed when Basinger and Rourke engaged in some foreplay at the bar . Mostly , however , the movie & quot ; story & quot ; was demeaning to women . It was not entertaining . It was boring . I give it two stars because of the locations . The movie shows off a side or two of New York City , and the evening photography was excellent .	-1
The most shocking thing about `` 9 1/2 Weeks '' is that it was actually made by adults ! When this came out in '86 , I was 18 and I LOVED it , but NOT for the reasons you might think . I was a sucker for visual style at the time , even over content ( Miami Vice , etc . ) , and I saw it many times in the theater . Having not seen it for about ten years I thought it would be fun to re-visit . What I found was a deeply dated film on the verge of self-parody . Certain episodes in their `` obsessive '' courtship are sitcom-ready but it 's the characters themselves that just do n't ring true . Kim Basinger , as Elizabeth is just kind of thick-headed . She 's best in the final scenes but , prior to that , she 's frustratingly naive and I do n't buy her as an art dealer for a second ! Mickey Rourke is equally annoying ; answering most lines with his trademark smirk . Who would really put up with that ? ! What 's interesting is how great he is when he 's given a moment to improvise ( as with the kids on the boardwalk ) but then he 's out of character . I like Mickey Rourke , and before Michael Madsen made a career out of stealing his whole shtick ( right down to the mannerisms and delivery ) he was truly unique ( his cameo in `` The Pledge '' with Jack Nicholson is heart-breaking ! ) , but he 's not given enough room here.Another problem is the music . This movie would be 50 % better without ANY music , not just the pop songs but the whole sappy score as well . There 's a nice Al Green intro at the beginning of the titles and Stewart Copeland , of The Police , wrote a cool instrumental for some Wall Street exteriors , but everything else should go ! Of course , coming off of `` Flash Dance '' , ( the movie pretty much responsible for pop song soundtracks ) , I guess it 's not a surprise , but the top 40 pop hurts this supposedly edgy , adult drama.What does work is the brilliant casting of every other character in the film . From the sales woman in the department store ( an AMAZING performance ! ) to all of Elizabeth 's art world friends . Visually the film holds up alright but not as flawlessly as other , more imaginitive , visual films of it 's day like `` Blade Runner '' . It 's a nice picture-portrait of New York at the time , though.The truth is that the mid-80 's were full of fluffy dramas and this one had the promise of going beyond that but , in the end , the director , or the movie company , totally betrayed its potential which is really too bad . As it sits , it 's an achingly self-conscious and timid set of music videos .	-1
Usually it 's not my game to publish spoilers on this site but fret not , there is n't much to spoil here ( were it not for film-like credits and sporadic bursts of tub-thumping music , you might in fact mistake this for a soft core video ) -- they meet at a butcher 's , eye oh so suggestively , then meet again , and again , and again . That 's your film there . Humble apologies.Both Rourke and Basinger should look fetching to their respective audiences . Their attire showcases delicious variety over all the rendezvous , ranging from wet and clingy to missing in action . Yet they traipse through their shenanigans like cyborgs , hissing much of the time and looking so painfully unsure one has an uncontrollable urge to furnish an obligatory smack on the head and a pointer to get on with it already.I 'm delighted for reviewers here who found something to enjoy in this teenage fantasy yarn -- the delicate vicissitudes of romance , the subtle games thereof , the dynamics of eros , all that jazz.Frankly , this reviewer would much rather have some semblance of a story , thank you . That failing , some goofy chitchat of the Before Sunrise variety would be fine . But all play and no talk makes 9.5 weeks an awefully dull time . I watched it with a 4x fast-forward , stopping at strategic locations as fitting , but that hardly makes for a recommendation does it .	-1
Clearly anyone who read the novel of NINE AND A HALF WEEKS will not enjoy the film version . The casting of Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke would get one 's hopes up ... but the writing and direction completely undermines them.This is not a story that should play like a 1980s MTV video.Let me repeat that again , THIS IS NOT A STORY THAT SHOULD PLAY LIKE A LAME 1980S MTV VIDEO.But it does . The filmmakers took a dark , erotic story where a woman is temporarily liberated by her sexuality just before she 's degraded and enslaved to the breaking point and instead made a sleek , empty love story , devoid of characters and their power plays.I blame this film for the career of Zalman King or whatever his name was and all the terrible `` erotic films '' where the sex scenes are filmed with blinding , flashing lights , blaring , obnoxious saxophones , and spastic , jerky editing.Check out SECRETARY with Maggie Gylenhaal and James Spader , a straight forward film about sexual power plays and kinkiness without the ridiculous light shows and blasting music.Maybe someone will someday remake NINE AND A HALF WEEKS and just film the story .	-1
Hands down this was the worst download of ALL TIME ! ! ! ! I have ben watching the no name movies for so long I do n't notice the little things that some claim take away from the quality of this movie genre . I have never ever been picky about all those little things you hear the new digital generation complain about . However this movie is the worst I have ever seen after making the purchase and downloading it under the assumption it was viewable . By the time I spend/waste all the time trying to get my money back it would be an even bigger mistake than the download . From now on I preview ALL movies I am going to purchase no matter how many times I have seen them on VHS , dvd , etc . Word to the wise people	-1
One of my favorite childhood films is ruined in this full screen DVD edition . Please release this fillm in its widescreen version as well ! Why not offer both versions so that consumers have a choice ?	-1
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on DVD but NO WIDESCREEN and no bang for your buck.Why issue a classic widescreen epic on DVD if you are not going to present it in its original aspect ratio ? This DVD is presented in Full Frame.The Laser Disc was in Widescreen . I made the mistake of waiting for it to come out on DVD . VHS will do for now . Thank you very much.Another stone cold waste of DVD . Count Zborowski must be as disapointed about this DVD as he was when he lost the original Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang in 1922 .	-1
I am really sick and tired of people saying how wonderful this movie is and how it 's the greatest childs movie . Well your wrong , this is a pathetic movie that is trying so hard to be a big hit like Mary Poppins it 's unbelievable ! I saw this movie when i was a child and hated it as it was so long and boring , and recently i watchd it on TV at christmas , i was very very bored O.K ! And was i the only one hoping the child catcher would lock up the children forever as i was fed up with their dreadful cockney screetchers.Dick Van Dyke was no good in Mary Poppins and is no good in this . Sally Ann Howes was meant to be the Julie Andrews of the movie , but was n't half as good an actress or singer to potray the character convincingly.I hate this movie , but love Mary Poppins and yet people say that they are similarWHY ?	-1
Leonard DiCaprio carries off his role in Aviator with aplomb . As for his role in the Man in the Iron Mask he 's a bomb.A King of France with an almost squeaky voice ? Should n't have accepted the script Leonard , you did better as `` The Kid '' in '' The Quick and the Dead '' and that was n't completely believable , but then neither were Hackman , or Stone , both too over blown.Back to `` Iron Mask '' the whole thing seem too contrived . Russell Crowe , the Preacher who swore off killing gunning down his opponents , for Pete 's sake take the bullet Russell you 'll still get paid.The Iron Mask needed somebody who could be suave and nasty as all get out , and young sir , you did n't have the chops for either of those qualities at the age you were when you made that film . Daniel Day Lewis , Alec Baldwin , or Tim Roth are names that pop into my mind who could be nasty and suave , that is to say perfidious enough to carry off the role.Old Timer	-1
Oh my , this is bad . Historically , the story is way off . Trust me . Richelieu and Mazarin , the real powers behind the French throne in this era , are n't even mentioned . The uprisings in Paris at this time were called the Fronde , an attempt by the nobles to win back lost power , not bread rioting which would take place nearly 150 years later . I could go on and on . Biographically , the script makes a mockery of the famous Dumas novel . Period ! The likelihood of having an actor of Swedish-Italian/German stock playing the rising `` Sun King '' of the 17th century has all the odds of a true Elvis sighting . Poor Leo might try portraying Leif Erikson next time.Nobody in the picture speaks French . Several minor characters have accents , but it 's basically `` California , here we come '' . Some of the costumes , especially at the ball , are alluring , but this is n't Gene Kelly 's `` An American in Paris '' circa 1950.This release is easily Leo 's weakest acting performance , one that he 'll hopefully never repeat.I suspect that the high ratings are merely a reaction to `` Titanic '' , votes of sexual attraction over true substance . They 'd better be . The world is full of those who make it , then break it .	-1
This 1955 film adopted today 's exortations to conserve energy and use as little as possible , which is how everybody interprets their roles in this film , including Mitchum 's horse . Mitchum rides into town at 2 kph on a spiritless nag with huge , wide haunches and sunk deep as a sofa . He stays out of the saddle after that -- - mounting the second time might get him to wheezing or passing out , even with the stepladder in place . The person who deserves the most credit for this film is the tailor who designed clever garb to disguise Mitchum 's potbelly , wide hips and broad beam behind , with boxy trousers having a heavy assignment . But alas , nothing can disguise the couch potato slowness of his heavy walk . Impossible to suspend enough disbelief to accept him as a one-man town tamer who 's ready , all by himself , to take on the Big Man and his innumerable hired guns who strangely never come into town en masse , but just dribble in to keep the odds low . There 's a ludicrous moment where Mitchum stands between two mounted tough guys who have the drop on him and and he takes control by fast flat hand slapping their thighs until they do what he wants ! This is the high point of Mitchum exertions in the film . Otherwise he resembles someone blurred out by a disabling hangover . We 're used to Mitchum 's laid back style , but it 's a safe bet he took this role because he knew ( from the advance script ) his pulse rate need never pass 55 anywhere in the film . Jan Sterling also just goes through the motions in the lacklustre script , trying to stay awake to earn her salary . Here is a western that never redeems itself and probably would n't do so even if Mitchum cared enough to put some snap into reading his lines -- - which he does n't . The producer of the film is Samuel Goldwyn JUNIOR , who seems not to have understudied his father carefully enough . Stay miles away from this 1955 limp noodle , crippled further by a semi-blurred sound track and no subtitles .	-1
Not much of a story and the actors must have felt that they really did n't need to act . And plastic poker chips in the 1800 's ? Please .	-1
I was expecting more with the cast but this movie was unrealistic and frankly pretty dumb . Same old outlaws without any personality . All Hollywood and fantasy . Not worth watching .	-1
Sequels are usually never as good as the originals , even though rarely they are as good . & quot ; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 & quot ; however is nowhere near as good as the first & quot ; Texas Chain Saw Massacre & quot ; which was very influential even for its low budget . & quot ; Massacre 2 & quot ; fails in every thing that it tries to do , from the corny opening scene to the joke of an ending . There is nothing good about this movie from what I can see . Although it stars Dennis Hopper and the original & quot ; Chainsaw 's & quot ; Jim Seidow , it is a very , very bad movie for three reasons- one is that it has no point , another is that it ca n't decide if its a horror or comedy , and the third is that is does n't really have the same feel as the original.First , even though it was directed by horror genius ( Texas Chain Saw Massacre ( 1974 ) , Poltregiest ) & quot ; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 & quot ; is not entertaining and has absolutly no point . It does show the family a dacade later , an angered family member of a victim , and a disk jockey who hears a murder , but it shows them , among other things , in really stupid ways . Leatherface is in it , of course , with his brother Chop Top ( was in Vietname during the original ) and the Cook from the first . Grandpa is also still around , and rediculously so . Dennis Hopper stars as Lefty , a deputy or park ranger or something who wants revenge on Leatherface and his family for the murder of his wheelchair bound nephew ( Franklin from the original ) and the tourment of his neice Sally ( the survivor from the original ) . Caroline Williams joins him as the annoying disk jockey named stretch who heard a murder while on a broadcast . There was no reason to make this movie . & quot ; The Texas Chain Saw Massacre & quot ; did fine without a sequel for 12 years , it could have gone on.Second , the question came down if this was a comedy or a horror . It was a campy horror flick that spoofed the original , but it was also a movie made to scare you a little . This movie did n't scare , and it did n't make me laugh either . It was just pathetic . At one point Leatherface attacks Stretch , and she 's cornered , then Leatherface has an orgasm on the saw ? What was going on there , and at another point a woman is eating Chile cooked by the Cook and she finds a tooth inside of it ( hinting its human meat ) . Another scene shows Dennis Hopper in a hardware store and he 's trying out chainsaws in a style that makes him look like Rambo or some big action hero . The movie was a joke , not in a funny way , but in a sad , pathetic way.Third , sequels usually carry on a story or at least have the same feeling as the original- & quot ; Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 & quot ; did n't . & quot ; Halloween & quot ; had the same type of feel as its sequels did . & quot ; Friday the 13th & quot ; had the same feel as its sequels . & quot ; A Nightmare on Elm Street & quot ; had the same feeling . & quot ; Texas Chain Saw Massacre & quot ; is a completely different movie from & quot ; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 & quot ; . The original was a dark , very scary movie about a family of psychotics in the backwoods of Texas . & quot ; Massacre 2 & quot ; was about a family of freaks living under an amusement park in Dallas Texas ( or maybe it was Huston ? ) .To conclude , do not watch , buy , rent , or think about this movie . There are much better movies out there ( i.e . the original & quot ; Texas Chain Saw Massacre & quot ; and the 2003 remake ) . It has no point , no feel , and no genre . The only thing that should have been cut up with a Chainsaw in 1986 was this movie .	-1
The idea is frightfully unnerving and executed with appropriate panache for a film of this type , but the unnecessary delineation with ridiculous black comedy completely destroys any praiseworthiness this movie can aspire to ... Hooper needs to concentrate less on comedy and more on artful frightening of people if he wants to make a good movie ... The Halloween series is much better than any of the garbage in the series of overrated flicks this turkey belongs to ...	-1
This is one of those movies that gore fanatics and Fangoria readers rave about . For them , this movie delivers . For others this is just a rehash of the original with plenty of gore injected to make up for what is lacking in the script . I did get the impression that Hooper may have tired of being nagged to do a sequel to his classic and instead did an over-the-top send-up to put an end to it . Unfortunately this just gave fuel to the idea of a sequel for others to do one . In this sequel the family , now named the Sawyers , has relocated to another texas community . Sally and Franklin 's uncle , a Texas Ranger , played by Dennis Hopper , is on the trail of the family . He enlists the aid of a lady DJ nicknamed Stretch ( yes , have as much fun with that one as you would like ) to draw out the family through her radio broadcasts . Leatherface , now called Bubba ( why ) , takes a liking to Stretch and really wants to show her his chainsaw ( I am not kidding , the chainsaw becomes an overly obvious phallic image in this movie ) . Leatherface also likes to dance when he attacks with his chainsaw by using a move he learned by watching a few too many ZZ Top videos . Beyond this point the movie consists of a lot of gore and redone scenes from the first movie ( hit her grandpa , hit her ; and even the chainsaw dance at the end ) . The technical inaccuracies with regard to special effects and continuity with the first film are abundant ( anybody familiar with the first film will laugh at the sight of Franklin 's flashlight , and let 's not even talk about pickups doing 100mph in reverse ) . If Hoopers intention was parody , he partly succeeded , but with such extreme gore in contrast to the original . The first movie succeeded so well by leaving the gore to the imagination of the viewer ; this movie puts all the gore on-screen and suffers for it.-Bob	-1
this movie is nowhere near as good as the original , this movie is long , boring and unbelieveable , whoever they got to play leatherface was a disgrace to the work gunnar hansen did in the original , just stick to the original if u want a good horror movie	-1
The Secret of NIMH was a dark story filled with dark acts and even darker characters . Secret of NIMH 2 is a complete and utter disgrace . NIHM 2 has nothing in common with the oringal . Timmy would 've been better of dead then star in this awful movie .	-1
Want a good laugh ? Scan through these reviews and read all the ones with *five star* ratings . What is WRONG with these people ? ! ? Don Bluth 's original NIMH is ( deservedly ) an animation classic that does n't underestimate the audience 's intelligence and is n't afraid to engage a deeper sense of worldly honesty that most animated features wo n't touch with a ten foot pole.The best that can be said for `` Timmy To The Rescue '' is ... well ... actually , nothing.Everything about this shameful excuse of a sequel screams `` lowest common denominator '' which can be verified by the few positive reviews listed in here . MGM should be slapped ( hard ) for contributing to the dumbing down of the masses by pereptuating such inane , anemic garbage like this . Sadly , thanks to the WalMart inspired `` git'r dun '' dummified mentality of the poor souls who flock to and support such substandard drivel , those of us seeking intelligent and thought provoking entertaiment have to dig deeper.Horrible .	-1
Robert C. O'Brien would be deeply offended at such a disgusting piece of garbage . He 's probably turning in his grave right now . As for Don Bluth , he probably cried when he saw it , as it trashed his legacy for the next generation . As a serious Secret of NIMH enthusiast , I find the film to be a gross manifestation of the phrase & quot ; You killed it. & quot ; I watch the fisrt movie on DVD at home , praying that children who are at the age I was when i was first touched by the film are n't watching this cheap trash . How can an animated film be this bad , you ask ? Read the books , Watch the first movie , and you will be as appalled as I am . What was MGM thinking ? Is this how they repay the greatest feat of animation their sorry corporation has ever witnessed ? By trashing it ? Uh uh . I think MGM owes the NIMH community , the children whose ideas of film they just warped , and most of all , Don Bluth , a BIG apology ... Nevermind the Amazon rating , I give it negative 5 stars , if that .	-1
Clive Barker is a genius , but Lord of Illusions just does n't work for me . You have this guy Nix who calls himself The Prophet ; he can do all kinds of real magic , yet he seems to be content in assembling a handful of incompetent cultists in the middle of nowhere , kidnapping a young girl , and juggling fire . He walks around in a T-shirt woefully incapable of covering his huge beer-belly , so it 's hard to take him that seriously . Just as we 're getting to know the guy , his former disciple Swann and three other escaped cultists swoop in and manage to bind him , after which they bury him deep in the ground so no one will ever find him . Now we jump ahead thirteen years . The kidnapped girl is married to Swann , and both begin to worry when a member of the Nix vanquishing party is killed , sensing that someone is trying to bring The Prophet back . Here 's where private detective Harry D'Amour steps in , stumbling his way around the major events ( and deaths ) that have to do with Nix 's `` death '' and imminent return . His detective skills and the magical abilities of Swann are n't enough to keep The Prophet in his grave , and the movie ends up coming full circle back to its beginning , featuring a final showdown between Swann and Nix.Personally , I think Scott Bakula was a bad choice to play D'Amour ; he is just not the hard-nosed private detective type , and his character 's lack of any real identity or personality makes him seem an illusion of sorts himself ( despite the fact he is supposed to be the protagonist ) . The romantic link that develops between D'Amour and Dorothea Swann ( Famke Janssen ) is simply lifeless . The clues he finds along the way basically fall into his lap , and I am hard pressed to explain how he figured out where to go and whom to talk to about a subject he knew very little about early on . This serves to highlight the fact that the script just is n't very good , even though Clive Barker himself wrote it . There is very little character development , several discoveries and arbitrary actions are presented without explanation , and there are plot holes each step along the way . You would think that a movie called Lord of Illusions would actually feature some impressive illusions-you 'd think so , but you would be wrong . This is most unfortunate because I think the concluding special effects were meant to offset the weakness of the plot . Many of the special effects were patently fake and highly disappointing . It 's hard for a movie to succeed with a combination of bad casting , bad plot , and bad effects . At the end , you may well be asking yourself what this movie was really about .	-1
O.K . Picture this ... you 're a Hollywood director and you 're going to make a film adaption of a smash Broadway musical about a Broadway musical and further adapt it so it rides the crest of a bunch of '80s pop culture dance movies ... the only problem is , you want the movie to have a bunch of & quot ; Flashdance & quot ; style crossover hits , and the smash hit tunes in the Broadway musical ... well , they 're too broadwayish for your taste ... so what do you do ... ? How about this - - cut 'em out ... replace them with a few feeble attempts at'80s pop radio crossover then take other tunes and dance numbers and have them actually written as dialogue or start them for a few seconds and fade to another scene ... and voila ... there you have it ... Friends ... if you 're buying this film to see your favorite numbers fromt he musical , flip a coin , they may or may not be there . A few are ... in fact , I 'd probably give the film only one star if it were n't for the fact that atleast they left & quot ; T*ts and *ss & quot ; and & quot ; Nothing & quot ; relatively untouched ... & quot ; At The Ballet & quot ; is there , but the 0-value production values hurt not help even the best numbers in this film . - - If you really want to experience the musical , either pray for a Broadway revival or go out and get the FANTASTIC soundtrack ... and if you happen to be into '80s pop culture , go out and rent FAME or FLASHDANCE ... both are infinitely better ! ...	-1
A CHORUS LINE : THE MOVIE has it 's best moments when it is simply music and dancing -- particularly when it stays true ( or close to ) to the incomparable stage version , as it does in the opening number and the closing showstopper , & quot ; One. & quot ; The main problem I have with the film is the fact that the stage show was about & quot ; dancers and love of the theatre , & quot ; while this movie is specifically focused on & quot ; kids breaking into showbiz. & quot ; This is most glaringly apparent in the depiction of the song & quot ; What I Did For Love. & quot ; In the show , that song was about those dancers expressing their passion for dancing and what it would mean if being forced to give it up . Here , the song 's meaning is cheapened by treating it as a character love song.Paul 's timeless , heart-breaking monologue is ripped to shreds ... and the most energetic group number in the piece ( & quot ; Hello Twelve ... & quot ; ) is given over to the Richie character for an unecessary song called & quot ; Surprise Surprise. & quot ; Even the mesmerizing & quot ; Music and the Mirror & quot ; is junked for the lesser & quot ; Let Me Dance For You. & quot ; I hope that someone gets the idea in their heads to re-film this beyond classic musical the way it was meant to be seen ... perhaps for public television ... .or simply revive it for Broadway where it belongs , with dancers , forever kicking those legs as the footlights come down night after night .	-1
I stupidly purchased this DVD on Ebay . The only astonishing thing about this movie was how much weight Gary Oldman lost to play the part . Nancy ( Chloe something or other ) was absolutely terrible . She whined her way through the movie putting my teeth on edge . I thought Gary 's acting was up to par and quite believable but this Nancy girl was a joke . And my head was spinning with questions such as where does a heroin addict such as Nancy afford to buy leather clothes and have her hair perfectly coiffed in each shot . They nearly burn down their hotel room yet the manager shoves them downstairs and still lets them stay . Where was Sid 's managers/PR 's ? ? ? ? ? ? ? He was 'SID VICIOUS ' ... ..He was someone . Why did n't he have a minder except for that whining girlfriend . Okay ... I 'm done .	-1
I do n't want to trash Brosnan ; in many ways he 's the ultimate Bond ( though some 10 years too late ) , but this film is without a doubt the worst 007 movie in history . Nothing against the cast ; they do what they can , but the thing that I never thought could take place in a Bond movie , happens here endlessly . -Boredom ! . It began with & quot ; Goldeneye & quot ; , and it 's gotten worse . James Bond movies have started to look like a big-scale Dolph Lundgren action-flick , or something . Where 's the imagination of the Moore-era ! ? . Where are the interesting characters ? . Where 's the good story ? . They 've become just another big-budget & quot ; blow 'em up & quot ; -actioner . Boring ! . They 're too serious , too dark , running from one desperate explotion to the next , lacking any kind of humour or memorable scenes . It 's the end of 007 , I 'm afraid . You may resign now , & quot ; Mr.Bore & quot ; .	-1
Lot of action in this one with very little thought going into the storyline . Not near as good as the earlier ones , this one falls flat on its face , gets a big thumbs down .	-1
Do n't get me wrong . I think Pierce Brosnan is still the 2nd best Bond ever -- no one replaces Sean Connery , naturally , but Brosnan does a pretty good job.However , I take issue with the story here . It 's what I like to call `` Cookbook Bond '' with every lack of originality of stories associated with Roger Moore , et al . Oh , another nuclear weapon ? Surprise ... I 'm not sure , but MAYBE THIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE ! ! And that 's not everything . Our villain is hardly menacing to say the least . `` There 's no news like bad news . '' Was that meant to sound evil or effeminate ? It 's hard to tell , because the line was delivered so badly.I was so disappointed in Jonathan Pryce , a fine actor whose talent really shines in movies like Brazil , but is really wasted here as the `` media mogul '' whose mission in life is to make headlines . All rightie ... let 's waste a few million people ( potential ) customers to basically hold on to a few more customers that we may glean from this ridiculous venture of mass murder.Whatever.I 'm thankful that Bond is still alive , but get original PLEASE ! ! At least Goldeneye had the semblance of originality ... financial chaos caused by an EMP strike was interesting to say the least .	-1
After resurrecting the Bond franchise singlehandedly with a bang in 1995 's Goldeneye , Brosnan hits the big screen for his sophomore outing as the larger-than-life superspy James Bond 007 in 1997 's Tomorrow Never Dies . Despite the hype of commercial endorsements and Teri Hatcher 's highly anticipated appearance as a Bond girl , Tomorrow Never Dies was a rather surprising setback to the Bond series.In this eighteenth Bond flick , Bond is off to investigate an incident off the South China Sea , where a British ship appeared to have crossed Chinese waters , eliciting a warning from the Chinese military , which amounted to retaliation on both sides . Deducing that one of the media sources , the Carver Media Group had released the news of the incident in question suspiciously earlier , Bond deduces that Eliot Carver ( Jonathan Pryce ) , the media magnate and owner of the Carver Media Group , had something to do with this international incident . It turns out that Carver is manipulating the news , in some way , shape or form to start a World War III for astronomical worldwide television ratings . Bond must stop further escalation of war by thwarting Carver 's plans.Tomorrow Never Dies is not exactly up to par with the Bond movies of the past , as a rather incompetent cast , an extremely over-the-top storyline , and a horrifically dull screenplay drag what could have been a solid Bond film into a forgetful disaster . Brosnan is probably the only saving grace of the film , as he turned in a decent Bond outing , although his performance in Goldeneye was far more superb . The blame does not lie squarely on Brosnan 's shoulders as his supporting cast was a big letdown . Michelle Yeoh of Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon fame is a solid martial artist , but rather static in personality , making her lines corny in the process . Teri Hatcher portrays the forlorn , tragic Paris , Eliot Carver 's husband and Bond 's old flame and it is quite disappointing that she is not only not the leading lady , but that she will go down as an uneventful Bond girl , since she does not get a whole lot of screen time in this film . As for Eliot Carver himself , he is the most disappointing character of the film as he is quite undeveloped and he winds up being a wimpy , whiny control freak megalomaniac . His henchmen are n't that much better either . Carver 's main henchman , Stamper ( Gotz Otto ) relies too much on his machismo , hence more unimaginative and plastic in his dialogue and portrayal . The short-lived Dr. Kauffman comes across as a formidable henchman , but becomes nothing but comic relief villiany fodder.As for the story itself , it is rather complex , in the sense that it alienates the viewer into ever being involved in the film 's purpose . The screenplay and dialogue are surprisingly poor and they drag on . However , Tomorrow Never Dies scores points for ingenious gadgets , in particular the trackpad-controlled , voice-activated BMW 540i and Carver 's boat drill . The action sequences are solid , with the pre-title sequence and the motorcycle chase standing out as highlights . In summing Tomorrow Never Dies up , it is not a bad film to watch and relax to on a Saturday night , but there are even better Bond flicks to not only sit back and enjoy , but to get you involved in the film .	-1
The history of the latter Bond films is one of false dawns , with sporadic good or near-great Bond films promptly followed by horribly disappointing ones . OHMSS was followed by the lazy Diamonds Are Forever , The Spy Who Loved Me by Moonraker , For Your Eyes Only by Octopussy , and sadly Pierce Brosnan 's enjoyable Bond debut GoldenEye remained true to form in being followed by another clunker . Tomorrow Never Dies was a famously troubled shoot , with a constantly rewritten unfinished script the most visible of its many problems . It 's that classic ` inbetween good Bonds ' film that just feels like its treading water while they recharge their creative batteries for the next one . The premise may sound absurd - Jonathan Pryce 's media mogul tries to start a war in Asia to boost circulation and viewing figures in return for local TV concessions - but it 's a scam that William Randolph Hearst pulled for real in the Spanish-American War with his infamous telegram to a reporter `` You supply the pictures and I 'll supply the war . '' True , he did n't use a Stealth Ship or a guided drill-torpedo to do it , but the film almost pulls it off as a framework for a Bond movie . The problem is that , aside from David Arnold 's excellent score , not much else really works.Pryce is n't exactly a threatening supervillain and his henchmen are a rather bland bunch with the exception of Vincent Schiavelli 's master assassin , who opts for broad overacting rather than menace . It may be an inspired idea to cast Michelle Yeoh as the leading lady , but with only one brief fight it seems rather pointless hiring one of the best action stars in the world if she does n't get to do much . Worse , the action scenes are distinctly hit-and-miss . The pretitle sequence is terrific and the remote-controlled car chase one of the more enjoyable gadget showcases , but somehow the motorbike vs. helicopter chase through the streets and rooftops of Saigon never works nearly as well as it should : the footage is good but there 's something almost haphazard about the editing that robs it of much of its potential . The film 's big finale is little short of disastrous . Reputedly intended to be on a larger scale but scaled down because the effects shots would n't be ready in time for the film 's opening date , there 's literally nothing at stake by this point - with WW3 safely averted , all that 's left for a somewhat bored Bond to do is walk around a badly designed and unappealingly photographed set shooting extras like he was in a bad video game before killing an old man with glasses.Throw in lazy plotting and some of the worst dialogue in the series history and even the few promising ideas thrown up along the way tend to get lost in the hurry to get something releasable in the can . While Die Another Day is most Bond fans ' choice for Brosnan 's worst Bond , that at least threw up some good ideas in the first half - this feels like a film where no-one had a decent idea between them but were contractually obliged to deliver a movie in time for Christmas anyway . Horribly disappointing.There 's not a great deal of in the way of new extras to justify an upgrade if you have the previous special edition - aside from the extras carried over from that , there 's a featurette on Moby 's Bond theme remix , some redundant clips from the movie and some weak deleted scenes . Among them is an extended briefing scene in M 's car where everyone is drinking cocktails that is so clumsily executed ( every shot ends with them raising a glass to their lips ) that it looks like an outtake from the old Thunderbirds TV series , so the film could clearly have been even worse , but that 's scant consolation . As per all of the Brosnan Bond DVDs , there 's no proper making of documentary either , just the odd puff-piece from its first release . One for the bond completists only , really .	-1
Carrie was NOT scary , once again stephen Kings novel was better than this movie . I only enjoyed the ending wen the pigs blood was poured on her , because it was the only good and funny part of the whole movie , my advise is to see the remake ... its way better . *~SMG FAN~*	-1
Am I the only one who remembers the 3 Laserdisc CAV box set that came out in the late 90 's with ALL THE MIRACULOUS Bonus features for Logan 's Run ? 100 's of stills , 2 mini docs , stills and script from Deleted Scenes and a whole lot more . Warner owns the same MGM material , there 's absolutely no reason for them NOT to release it on this Blu ray . Pathetic	-1

Based upon an outstanding book by Cornelius Ryan , this movie tells the story of Field Marshall Montgomery 's ambitious but very risky plan to invade Germany in the fall of 1944 , by dropping airborne troops to take strategic bridges , and sending an armored column to link up with the airborne troops . The plan required too much to go perfectly , it did n't , and the plan failed . The movie is told mostly from the British point of view , but that is appropriate because the British planned the operation and took most of the casualties . The British 1st Airborne Division , commanded by Roy Urqhart ( Sean Connery ) was dropped 64 miles behind enemy lines , right on top of a Panzer division , and was nearly wiped out . Only 2,000 of the 10,000 men in the division made it back to allied lines.This is a war movie in the grand tradition , made before moviemakers could cheat with digital effects . Thus , the massive air drops , for example , were real . ( The same airdrop portrayed in the recent HBO series & quot ; Band of Brothers & quot ; relied on digital effects to paint in many of the parachutes in the background . ) Unfortunately , the film that this DVD was mastered from was in dreadful , really terrible condition . There are flecks and white spots galore , all throughout the picture . These white flecks can be digitally & quot ; repaired , & quot ; but no one bothered to do that on this DVD . Consequently , this is just about the worst looking DVD I have ever seen . A movie this magnificent deserved a better DVD treatment , authored from a cleaned up , fully restored film . My grade of two stars is for the DVD only ; the film is easily a five star film , especially for war movie and WWII movie buffs .	-1
A Bridge Too Far has been one of my favorite films for a long time . It was the first more-or-less realistic war movie I saw as a kid and has held its own against more modern movies ever since , giving up its spot at the top of my list only to titles like Saving Private Ryan . That said , I was dissatisfied with the old DVD release , and looked forward to this special edition as a chance to get a better transfer of the film.No such luck . The picture quality vacillates between decent , acceptable , and unforgivably hazy . Some scenes look like a badly compressed JPEG image , and others look as though someone had just breathed on the lens ( not a problem in my old VHS release , which still manages to look better than this DVD ) . The special features are nice , especially the interviews with Richard Attenborough , but then again , I did n't buy A Bridge Too Far for the special features , did I ? Still waiting , patiently , for a better transfer .	-1
The low rating is for the Blu-Ray , single disc edition : Very grainy image on about 60 % of the movie , particularly on the dark scenes.Other than that the movie is quite enjoyable : great cast , good to great acting , very convincing setting , exciting and very well filmed battle scenes , and a solemn message ( in my opinion ) about the unpredictability of the outcomes of war . It is about a real historical operation ( the Market Garden operation ) which seemed well crafted and promising , but which proved to be a failure due to the many uncertain factors surrounding it ( favorable weather conditions , low German morale , efficient radio communications , etc ) .The movie is quite long but extremely enjoyable , if you can ignore those grainy scenes . I especially love that it does not present the Germans as soulless monsters , but instead it fairly portraits them as patriots doing their best to fight a lost cause in the most chivalrous and less villainous way possible . One of the most humane and balanced war movies I have ever seen . Second only to Full Metal Jacket in its effectiveness to transport the viewer into a major military conflict.Buy it on regular DVD , unless this single Blu-Ray edition is priced below $ 10.Note : There is a two disc Blu-Ray edition , but I have not read comments on its image quality ( or lack of it ) .	-1
Did Patton make this movie ? Because it seems like it was done as a hatchet job against Richard Montgomery and the great people of Great Britain and Ireland . I love how they turned an operation that was 90 % successful into a defeat . The anti-British racism in this movie is disgusting . The Germans are portrayed as great heros fighting against all odds stopping Market Garden . Montgomery is portrayed as the blundering fool . Watch this movie if you get WWII mixed up with the American revolutionary war .	-1
This is a cheesy vcerson of the Christmas carol . It messed up the story line from the past to . Characters are alive that are supposed to be dead . Carface is supposed to be in Hell he got pulled down into it at the end of the second one.If you are 5 or older . The good thing about it is a lot more approapriate than the original and is rated corrected . I think the first one should have ben PG13 and the second should of been PG . Unfortunatley back then the did not have any pg13 rated cartoons until Beehives in Butt do America can out.It would have be better Ive they had put the king gator in it . Belonda is okey she is evil and wicked . But I 've seen betetr . If I had a top hundred villians list see would be the 11th on the list .	-1

When I finally got the chance to see this so-called great Bette Davis flick , I could'nt believe how disappointed I was . The beginning of the story was wonderful , Bette playing the wicked southern belle . There were a few good scenes and bam ! The movie was over ! I was like where is the rest of the story ? ? ? I felt truly short changed and I wanted more Bette ! Of all the Oscar caliber Bette Davis performances The Letter , Deception , All About Eve , The Old Maid , and Now Voyager , she wins the Academy Award for this dud !	-1
Ninotchka , 1939 filmThe film begins with a view of Paris . Next there is a hotel with people entering and leaving . Three men make small talk about their views . The Russian Board of Trade sent them to Paris . Their valuable suitcase must be locked in a vault . The hotel waiter seems interested in their conversation , and leaves to make his report to the Grand Duchess about their jewels . They bargain over the price for the jewels . An attorney shows up with the papers to stop the sale . You can guess the events by the servants who enter the room . [ This is a comedy . ] Moscow sends them new orders and an extraordinary diplomat . `` It wo n't be long now , comrades . '' She is all business , no humor , and assigns new tasks . `` You must have been smoking a lot . '' Are the stairs faster than the elevator at the Eiffel Tower ? [ In this movie . ] Ninotchka shows her attitudes . A subject for study ? `` What do you do for mankind ? '' [ Does Ninotchka talk like a machine ? ] `` What kind of girl are you ? '' [ Just who is being spoofed here ? ] `` You 're very talkative . '' Ninotchka visits a restaurant for lunch . The talk is n't that funny , now . `` Ha-ha . '' [ The moon joke is still funny ! ] `` What 's so funny about this ? '' Later Ninotchka laughs during a legal discussion . It that hat meant as a joke ? [ The talk is not that funny , the film starts to drag . ] They meet at a fancy restaurant . Leon is with a well-dressed Ninotchka . The Grand Duchess shows her attitudes . Leon has a new task : get Ninotchka out of the powder room . Later , the Grand Duchess comes to visit , and Ninotchka learns the jewels are missing ! There is talk about the ownership of the jewels . [ State laws vary . ] Will there be a long drawn-out court case ? Not if Ninotchka leaves for Moscow . Will she do it ? `` Never complain , never explain . `` Leon wants to visit Moscow , but they are afraid of saboteurs . [ Would this attitude pass the TSA inspection ? ] The May Day celebration goes on . [ International Labor Day . ] The conversation is about clothes and underwear . Different clothes for different times of the day ? `` No music . '' [ Really ? ] The talk implies a housing shortage ; three girls share a large room . Ninotchka gets a letter from Leon - it is all censored . Those three men are sent to Constantinople to trade in furs , but they need to be watched . Ninotchka is sent on this job . We see these three men have opened a restaurant to go into business for themselves ! [ Will there be conflict ? ] Leon meets Ninotchka , and has a plan to keep Ninotchka there . Will it work ? [ Is this movie worth watching ? ] The events in 1939 Europe limited its marketability . It is not that funny either , if it was then . Any film that deals with a volatile situation runs a risk of becoming dated . An undefined country will not go out of style due to political changes ( `` The Lady Vanishes '' , `` The 39 Steps '' ) . Part of the humor comes from the differences in style , like when someone comes from a small town to the big city ( `` The Beverly Hillbillies '' ) . Was Russia really selling off the jewels of the aristocracy to buy products that would benefit the people ? Their `` Five Year Plan '' resulted in massive industrialization that prepared for the future , winning instead of losing .	-1
I was 4 years old when this movie was released , but I vividly remember Irene Cara 's smash song of the same name in 1980 ( especially the chorus of , `` Fame , I 'm gon na live forever '' ) and , after so many years , I was really looking forward to a great movie and boy was I disappointed.I was thoroughly bored during the first half-hour . The audition sequence should have been cut down by half the time because it got boring after 15 minutes.After this painful sequence , the movie finally gets underway . I tried to stick with the movie for the next hour and could n't do it . I appreciated what the teachers had to say about the performing arts ( it IS hard work - everybody 's an actor , dancer , and/or musician but only a very small percentage actually make a living doing it ) , and I definitely appreciated the part about having to keep up your academic studies while pursuing a career in entertainment , but the movie just did n't flow for me . Perhaps it would have to do with the fact that I 'm not one of those people who is n't proclaiming to anyone who 'll listen that I 'm an `` actress '' ( and who rolls their eyes at those people who do ) .Besides the slow pace of the story , `` Fame '' is very dated . The off-the-shoulder top ( that became the rage of the early-80s due to Cara 's video ) and the depressed backdrop of the decaying inner city that characterized that `` wonderful '' decade known as the 1980s gives a potential viewer the incentive to stay away from this movie.I do n't get the hype about this film at all . - Donna Di Giacomo	-1
Alan Parker has spent much of the last fifteen-odd years complaining about why he has n't had the respect that he feels he deserves . Movies like this are the reason . He 's a bloody awful director.He 's a bloody awful director not because he does n't have an eye for a cute project ( a gangster movie with splurge instead of blood , and kids instead of adults ; a hopeless Dublin soul band who only fail to make good by sheer bad luck ) - clearly , he has a producer 's sense of what could make money . But , given every chance , he consistently fails to deliver , thanks to a persistent lack of interest in what it 's actually like to live the stories that he tells . His training in advertising means that he continues a shot , or a scene , for exactly as long as he reckons it will take the least dim person in the audience to get the basic idea , and no longer . Performances in his films are given no room to breathe . The editing is brutally economical and consistently curt . He is not really interested in the people in this film , or for that matter any other film he 's made ; he just wants to sell the idea to the audience ( in the case of this movie , Youthful Exuberance and How Talent Should Be Given A Chance ) .There might 've been an OK movie in this , but Parker 's failure to feel anything more than mildly avuncular interest in the characters ruins the whole thing . Plus I hate the songs , but OK , that 's just me.I went to a drama school . It was nothing like this . This is like a two-hour-long bad pop video . And I like pop videos . Something went very , very wrong somewhere .	-1
& quot ; Fame & quot ; is the electrifying drama/musical from Alan Parker . It follows a troupe of wanna-be students through their trials and tribulations and it positively sizzles with memorable performances , potent songs and dazzling dance sequences . Criticized upon its release , & quot ; Fame & quot ; nevertheless managed to do boffo box office and made the successful transition to the small screen , becoming one of the most talked about and watched television series of the 1980 's . Remember that name , Fame ! Unfortunately there 's nothing to stand up and cheer over with Warner Brothers lack luster transfer . It 's softly focused , features a bleached out and faded color scheme , excessive film grain and some minor edge enhancement . During the dimly lit scenes fine details disappear into a muddy mess of blues , blacks and browns . Skin tones are often quite orangy and there is nothing natural about the color balancing that swings wildly from total saturation in some scene to incredible desaturation , almost to the point of looking black and white or , at the very least , tonal gray , during other moments . The soundtrack is remastered in 5.1 . It 's dated and strident but on the whole an ample job of a vintage 80 's recording.Extras : The back advertises a & quot ; Class Reunion & quot ; feature which in actuality is a collective audio commentary track with various cast members spouting off , sometimes needlessly , about their experiences in making the film . Also incl . - a vintage featurette that has dated badly and the film 's original theatrical trailer . Come on , W.B . - you 're slipping.Bottom line : If you 're a fan of this movie and ca n't live without it , buy it . But if you 're looking for superb DVD mastering and vintage image quality - look elsewhere !	-1
Having examined other reviews on this site , I can only explain some of them as the result of voting for attractive people . After watching this movie , this convinces me that if I ever commit some horrible crime , that I should get Katie Holmes or James Marsden to defend me.The review ... this tries treading Stepford Wives/Lottery ground by being a chilling picture of conformity & amp ; savagery . It attempts to be scary , but seems to rely a lot on this camera trick where eyes glow neon red . It reminds me of a sports drink commercial . So if this kind of thing scares you , then this also might.Characters are badly written . The janitor 's supposed to be a genius feigning retardation in order to study people closely , but he seems to be inserted into the movie like a fish into a sandbox ... you do n't rightly understand why he 's there , but someone put him there for a reason . Basically , he makes 'plot ' advance & amp ; it 's his only reason for being in film.Katie Holmes may not be the greatest thespian , but I could n't rid myself of the idea that all her 'bad girl 'tude ' had more to do with a contempt for herself for appearing in this film . Really . Contempt seemed to ooze out of my tv screen and I almost got up to wipe it got so bad . She was either working so hard on getting this 'emotional tone ' right or betrayed that she , like the rest of us , had a cable bill to pay and this lousy job would cover it.The box cover betrays that this movie is basically a series of situations that attractive people get into . If you 're shopping for narrative , shop elsewhere . If you want situations for the sake of situations and shot without a lot of regard to logic , then watch this movie.Audio of poor quality and made dialogue hard to hear , but considering the quality of what I DID hear , I did n't bother rewinding.Oh , someone quotes a Pink Floyd song in an odd moment & amp ; this is good because it is unintentionally funny.James Marsden 's & amp ; Katie Holmes ' character do n't seem to have much reason for falling in love or whatever beyond the fact that they both have good cheekbones.Oh , and the outdoor shots showed a very beautiful woodland area.k	-1
I was n't impressed with Disturbing Behavior . It held my interest ( to a degree ) for just about an hour , but after that my attention faded almost completely . This film was unoriginal and the plot was weak and quite vague . I ca n't say that the acting was poor , it was okay . This movie was n't completely bad , but it was below average though . The most impressive thing about Disturbing Behavior was the opening scene with the night sky . Skip this one .	-1
This movie is quite horrible , just as horrible as Bergman 's own experience with these people I guess . Given the `` realism '' of this movie it is very useful in order to avoid all the crazy , oppressive people described in it . Moreover , it could be useful to create change within Norwegian society . It is political in that way . The family described here is no better than the one in `` Texas Chainsaw '' . Have a good one , Norway .	-1
I know the critics love this movie . They consider this film to be a great movie . I did not like it I do not feel it shows how real people react in real life . I realize that Europeans have a different attitudes about sex than Americans . However , when a married man chases a maid and the wife , who loves him , does n't care , and then the man comes home and has sex with his wife-well , it was too much for me . Real people do not act this way in real life . Not recommended .	-1
Poor John Frankenheimer ! Forced to defend a movie he has obviously directed to pay his taxes . Allright , at that time ( 1985 ) , few directors have resisted the Cannon Group pressure . This company hired well-known directors , screenwriters and actors and produced a lot of bad ( when I say bad , I 'm still nice ) movies.Now , we have a Robert Ludlum novel about a nazi conspiracy , a good actor , Michael Caine , two or three old public favorites , Lilly Palmer and Mario Adorf and an action movies director : John Frankenheimer . Result : great cinematography but a marmalade thriller which will not be the highlight of Frankenheimer 's filmography.Too bad MGM chooses to present this movie because sound and image are first rate . Berlin and Lake of Geneva 's country are well photographed and the first five minutes of the movie , shot in black and white , are the only reason why I do n't give a 1 to THE HOLCROFT COVENANT.An unnecessary DVD .	-1
`` The Holcroft Covenant '' is a 1985 film starring Michael Caine with Victoria Tennant , Lillie Palmer , and Anthony Andrews . John Frankenheimer directs from a 1978 Robert Ludlum novel of the same name.John Frankenheimer ( 1930-2002 ) directed more than 50 films from 1957 to 2002 . He was twice nominated for a Golden Palm ( `` All Fall Down '' and `` Seconds '' ) and 6 times by the DGA ( `` Manchurian Candidate '' , `` Birdman of Alcatraz '' , `` Grand Prix '' , `` Andersonville '' , `` Path to War '' ) . He won Emmys for `` George Wallace '' ( 1997 ) , `` Andersonville '' ( 1996 ) , `` The Burning Season '' ( 1994 ) and `` Against the Wall '' ( 1994 ) . Frankenheimer is well known for his use of non-traditional camera angles , which he employs extensively in this film.Michael Caine is a film icon and veteran of more than 100 films . He won two Oscars ( `` The Cider House Rules '' and `` Hannah and her Sisters '' ) and was nominated 4 more times ( `` Alfie '' , `` Sleuth '' , `` Educating Rita '' , and `` The Quiet American '' ) . He won the Golden Globe 3 times ( `` Jack the Ripper '' and `` Little Voice '' ) and was nominated 8 more times . Caine played in several films about WW2 and the cold war ( e.g. , `` The Ipcress File '' , `` Funeral in Berlin '' , `` The Jigsaw Man '' , `` The Fourth Protocol '' , `` Midnight in Saint Petersburg '' ) . Caine does an adequate job , but he certainly has done better.Victoria Tennant has been in more than 40 films , most notably `` Best Seller '' ( 1987 ) , `` Whispers '' ( 1990 ) , and `` All of Me '' ( 1984 ) . She was nominated for a Golden Globe for `` The Winds of War '' ( 1983 ) . She transitioned from films to TV in the 90s . Never known for her consummate acting skills , she provides an attractive love interest for Caine.Anthony Andrews is primarily an English stage , film , and TV actor . He won a British Oscar and a Golden Globe for `` Brideshead Revisited '' ( 1981 ) for which he also received an Emmy nomination . He 's probably best known for his recurring role as Tony on TV 's `` Love Boat '' . Andrews does an excellent job as one of the Covenant administrators.By now you 're asking yourself what 's up with a film about an American in Germany when the three lead actors are British . Good question . Apparently the leading role was to go to James Caan who walked out at the last minute and Michael Caine took over.For a spy thriller , the film is n't exactly very thrilling . Some parts are deadly dull , and the attempts to liven it up ( e.g. , a Prostitute festival ) look and feel artificial . Moreover the plot has holes big enough to drive a tank through ( e.g. , if Caine 's father believed that Caine would not be sympathetic to Nazi ideology , why did he name him as the principal administrator of the trust ? ) . There are far better `` what are the Nazi 's doing now ? '' films , such as `` The Boys from Brazil '' ( 1978 ) .	-1
I rented `` Holcroft Covenant . '' If you are a Ludlum junkie and you 've got to see the film , I do n't suggest a purchase until you have seen the film .	-1
This wretched , utterly boring ninjas-on-the-loose fiasco has all the markings of a lowbudget mid-70 's drive-in cheapie -- ugly cinematography , incoherent plotting , large body count and comically inept slow motion action set pieces . There are plenty of movies from this era every bit as bad as THE KILLER ELITE but what makes this particular title stand out from the rest of the lowly bunch is that it was directed by Sam Peckinpah , one of America 's greatest film artists.Peckinpah had managed to work a great deal of magic out of similarly banal thriller material a few years before in THE GETAWAY , thanks to his trademark rapid fire editing of some furiously violent suspense sequences ; that film also benefited from a typically cool performance from the charismatic Steve McQueen . With ELITE , the director clearly did n't care at all and shot everything as quickly and perfunctorily as possible . He appears to have forgotten even his most rudimentary of cinematic skills , clunkily filming everything with a generic , TV-Movie obviousness . Peckinpah is n't helped at all by James Caan and Robert Duvall , two normally fine and powerful actors who , undoubtedly due to their vaguely defined characters , give frankly dull performances that completely fail to draw us into the proceedings . The end result is a film that is easily tied with CONVOY as Peckinpah 's most infuriatingly awful effort ; its truly sad seeing such a major talent waste himself away on such utterly substandard rubbish.Its a real shame that this film would inexplicably get a proper DVD release while absolute masterpieces like THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE , BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA , CROSS OF IRON and PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID continue to languish in the vaults .	-1
James Caan And Robert Duvall Star in This revenge thriller about two spies one betrays the other and the other plots to get even with him . Another peckinpah disater . No dialouge just dumb action sequences pretty lame i have ever seen . See Caan in Rollerball instead . As for duvall his talent is truly wasted here .	-1
Poor Jessica Lange . Who can explain her absurd movie choices ? This one , by Sam Shepard , is one of the most ill-thought , sadly written , and depressing attempts at 'thoughtful comedy ' that I have witnessed in perhaps the last ten years . The screenplay , which , plainly put , is dull , silly , and ugly , does nothing to better Langes ' performance . She is the best thing in this movie , though she deserved to be in a better production.Everything reeks of pseudo-sentimentality and stupidity . The fathers ' morbid desire to kill his horse , the mothers ' dreary nostalgia revolving around the missing male members of the family , the niece 's pathetic attempts at getting laid , and Lange 's miffy relationship with her comatose father . These are situations that look bad even on paper , but on film , they just 'do you in ' , as Liza Doolittle would say.The worst scenes are those with Lange 's father and uncle walking the railtracks talking . That , and yet another scene between the two arguing in the hospital room while sharing a bottle of alcohol could well be one of the most idiotic sequences ever put to film . This is pointless , insipid moviemaking , and the director should be arrested for whatever charge can be fumbled upon him.This is an excellent example of how a bad screenplay can ruin an already lifeless film . As for Lange , sure , its a much better role than her other breathtaking turn in 'King Kong ' , but she would do better to forget family alliances and concentrate on far more worthwhile projects such as her recent 'Titus ' .	-1
In fairness , it is only Schwarzenegger 's presence which lifts this movie out of the 1-star category . There are some fairly good fight scenes , a few nifty sets , and some nice location filming . Other than that , however , it is a waste of time . There are numerous technical errors and other indications of slipshod production values . Nielsen 's acting , if you are so generous as to call it that , is embarassingly bad . Sandahl Bergman , normally pretty competent , overcooks it completely as the evil queen . If you like this type of heroine , it would be preferable to spend your time watching Xena , which though far from high art , is much better than & quot ; Red Sonja. & quot ;	-1
I saw this picture a few times in the theaters when I was a big fan of violent action movies . & quot ; The Soldier & quot ; is merely another violent B-movie.An antiterrorist ( A pre- & quot ; Wiseguy & quot ; Ken Wahl ) and his team set out to thwart a Soviet plot to detonate a nuclear device in the oil fields of the Middle East. & quot ; The Soldier & quot ; is simply another forgettable low-budget action movie . The film is extremely violent . Viewers who merely want to see blood and gore will not be disappointed by this picture ; the film graphically shows people being shot or burned to death . In one particularly offensive scene , the movie literally shows the audience how to make an electrically-charged incendiary device . The picture is n't particularly exciting or suspenseful . The dialogue between the characters sounds unrealistic . Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a cameo appearance as a treacherous foreign agent. & quot ; The Soldier & quot ; is simply another trashy and forgettable action movie . The film is only for those who merely want to see violent action . For a superior antiterrorist thriller , see John Frankenheimer 's & quot ; Black Sunday. & quot ;	-1
Strange Brew is a fun and entertaining bit of Canadian slapstick . I give the movie 4 stars . It 's the DVD that I 'm unhappy with.The Bob and Doug McKenzie characters were honed on SCTV ( Second City Television ) back in the late '70s . Their skits revolved around Canadian stereotypes ( especially their appearance and speech idioms ) , coupled with an insatiable fascination with beer . Layered on top was a charmingly navet & eacute ; and a classic brotherly rivalry . Doug ( Dave Thomas ) invariably dominated the diminutive Bob ( Rick Moranis ) , both physically and mentally . Think of them as a kinder , gentler , Canadian dumb & dumber.The comedy of Bob and Doug transfers surprisingly well to the big screen . Even so , the movie is not nearly as funny as the SCTV skits . Still , it 's funny enough to be worth owning for those who enjoy slapstick and camp , as well as for folks who are already Bob and Doug fans . It 's also interesting to see some of Rick Moranis ' early work , given that he 's become such a big star in the past few years ( Honey , I shrunk/blew-up the & lt ; whatever > , Ghost Busters , Space Balls , Little Shop of Horrors , and MANY more ) .The DVD is another matter . Based on the information I 've seen , there are no extra features on this DVD . It looks like this will just be the movie . I would have loved to have the two `` hosers '' themselves doing a commentary track ( in character of course ) . That worked brilliantly on the Spinal Tap DVD , and would have been a great bonus here.Deleted scenes would have been nice too . Alas , it looks like an el cheapo production , where they just slap the movie down on DVD to take advantage of the booming DVD market without having to invest any effort . I HATE it when they do that ! However , I will buy this DVD anyway , because this is something of a cult flick , and it 's unlikely they will do a better job with it any time soon , if ever .	-1
I FELT REALLY CHEATED VIEWING THIS FILM AND THE TIME IT TOOK FOR ME TO YAWN THROUGH.THE PROBLEM HERE IS THIS SCRIPT , IN WHICH THE FIRST HOUR SHOULD HAVE BEEN BURIED UNDER 100 POUNDS OF STEEL ! THE BEST PART WAS THE LAST 15 MINUTES WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN IT 'S BEGINNING.THIS HAS NONE OF THE EXCITMENT THAT `` BODY SNATCHERS '' OR `` THE OMEGA MAN '' HAD.I FELT NO INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR ANY OF THESE CHARACTERS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EDWARD G. ROBINSON 'S WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MAIN CHARACTER.HE ALWAYS LOOKS PAINED IN HIS ROLES AND IN THIS HE HAS REASON.IN MOST OF THIS FILM BETWEEN YAWNS I KEPT WONDERING `` SO ? `` .AS I HAVE SAID..THE FAULT HERE IS A MEANINGLESS SCRIPT.SOOO ... GO OUT AND ENJOY ANY OF THE THREE `` BODY SNATCHERS '' INSTEAD .	-1
I ordered it and something came up on the screen saying I was getting it for free with order , so I cancel it on my orginal order and I never received it . I do n't know what happened or what was going on .	-1
Heard about it through the movie grape vine . It 's worth a watch but not a purchase . Not sure what I was expecting . Maybe some type of cult classic or looked over sleeper movie . In my opinion it is neither . I 'd rather re-watch THX or Logan 's run .	-1
This film had great potential , but it blew it badly . Everyone by now knows the plot and the famous catch phrase `` Soylent Green is people ! '' ( it 's now cinema folklore ) . While the idea of the film ( overpopulation , evil corporation ) is excellent , any impact the film may have is thwarted by bad dialogue , cheesy music , uneven editing , and worst of all , Richard Fleischer 's lumbering , ponderous direction . Fleischer is a particularly bad director ( he directed such awful films like Che ! , Doctor Dolittle , and the wretched The Jazz Singer , yes , the one with Neil Diamond ) , and here he really ruins the film with questionable camera moves , bad framing , and just an overall sloppiness to the filmmaking.The film has good performances . Charlton Heston is excellent ( as usual ) as a cynical , tough cop . Edward G. Robinson has a poignant role as Sol . This was Robinson 's final film . He had cancer , and he died a mere 9 days after his role was completed , which gives his death scene here an extra poignancy . There 's a scene in an orphanage where Heston talks to a burnt out priest that is especially powerful . But scenes like this are few and far between , and it 's a shame , as it could have been much more .	-1
Hard to watch . Depressing and poorly done . It was made in the seventies but a story of the future in 2022 . It was n't very realistic as the phones , tv 's etc were all old and not new tech . There was nothing good about it . I thought because of the actors it would be better .	-1
My 13 year old son read the book as required reading in school . Near the end of his reading of the book we watched this together . There is an older version in black and white that might be better , but we chose this later version honestly at random . I am nearly a senior citizen now and had to read this book in my youth as well . After many decades of life and literature under my belt , I am not sure why this story withstands the test of time . The movie is true to the book ( more or less ) in its major storylines . It still is morbid and cruel in its themes . Fortunately the movie is without the overly heavy descriptive prose of Golding 's novel . If you never read the book nor see the movie in your lifetime , you would never regret it . There are many more stories about children with elevating and inspiring themes to inspire one 's spirit .	-1
I did n't realise that this movie was a pedophile movie . The boys ran around in their underwear for most of the movie .	-1
One can not criticize the cinematography of this move . It is , at times , lush , humid and tropically , oppressively beautiful . All of which are good things ... ... but that 's all I can say good about the film.Golding originally conceived & quot ; Lord of the Flies & quot ; as an xploration of Human nature , and how people are inheirently evil . To drive this point home , he took English school boys ( some of whom were members of a church choir ) crash landed them on an island during a wartime evacuation and said , & quot ; Have at it ! & quot ; ( metaphorically speaking ) . The book and indeed the 1963 movie version asks how if even children can become cruel and violent and evil with very little prompting , are humans as advanced as we like to think ? Are we really all that different from animals ? Readers/viewers are shocked to see how far such a small child can fall.Weeeeeeeeellllllll ... This , the 1990 version of Lord of the Flies , puts American military students on an island during a conflict of some sort , so when the first blow is struck it 's not all that surprising . This removes the impact of Golding 's ideas , and this becomes another adventure story ( of sorts . Like & quot ; The Hun Family Robinson & quot ; ) . Further , the & quot ; updated & quot ; material does n't really work : the glo-sticks , kids talking about watching & quot ; ALF & quot ; on TV ( which seriously dates this movie . I guess the screenwrighter thought ALF would be around forever . Another example of the narrowness of this version . It is already obsolete , while the book perseveres . ) , Simon having a vision of a stealth bomber , etc.. It 's all a bit too uneven , too naive almost , but totally lacking in charm ( if such a word can be used here ) . In essence , this is a visceral film that lacks guts.Nothing upsets me more than movies that violate the basic premise of a book ( & quot ; The Handmaid 's Tale & quot ; also comes screaming to mind ) , and this movie goes out of its way to be & quot ; different & quot ; but identifibe by its title . Really , this should have been called something else for as much as the story is like the book ; perhaps & quot ; Ishtar & quot ; would be more appropriate.One weird editing glitch I noticed was an image of a sunrise - the viewer sees it from a cliff with a tree interveing the space . Well , that night at sunset we see the same tree , the same cliff , but reversed ! ! Like the sun rose and set in the same place in the sky and the tree had turned to meet it . It 's very disconcerting.So , unless you 're taking a class in comparative cinema , do n't bother with this one . An , whatever happened to Balthazar Getty ? I thought his name guaranteed his career longevity . Weird ...	-1
How do you turn a book as visceral and gut-wrenching as the Lord of the Flies and turn it into Hollywood mush ? If you want the answer to that question , watch this movie . Otherwise , do n't bother . The acting is not exactly Haley Joel Osment quality , the scenes of savagery are played down IMO so they lose some of their horrific nature , and some of the dialogue and scenes are dumbed down.One area where this movie does get it right is the sets and the cinematography . The stunningly beautiful scenery does provide a nice offset to the action on screen . Leave it to Hollywood to get the look right -- enough to suck you in with a great trailer -- yet fail to deliver the goods .	-1
I ca n't believe anyone would rate this movie worth five seconds of their time ! ! ! ! Broderick Crawford as a fast gun ! ! ! ? Good god , I never saw an actor so out of place in any movie . And that name , VINNIE HAROLD ! ! ! Who the heck thought that one up ! ? My kids and I laugh our heads off every time this movie comes on TV . To us , it 's as ridiculous as `` Blazing Saddles '' , and might be funnier . As for Glen Ford , an actor I usually like , his performance could n't be much more overwrought if he tried . I love westerns in general , but this is a real stretch . Horrible movie .	-1
Here 's where it all began : the first of director Sergio Leone 's `` spaghetti westerns '' and the movie that launched Clint Eastwood 's career . Leone and Eastwood would go on to have many triumphs both together and apart , but when this film is stripped of its historical importance what 's left is an average-at-best western . A low-budget affair marred by ugly photography and bad audio dubbing , FISTFUL 's thin plot is cribbed from Kurosawa 's YOJIMBO ( and , indirectly , Dashiell Hammett 's novel RED HARVEST ) but lacks the artistry of its sources . The result is a disappointingly dull , uninvolving film . Even its meager compensations -- some decent action sequences and a great Ennio Morricone score -- would be topped in later efforts . This has none of the operatic grandeur or masterful vision with which we associate Leone ; if you 're looking for a good entry point into his work , check out the brilliant ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST . This one 's safe to skip .	-1
The second half , since that 's the one that let me down the most and ruined the potential for some actual interest.The Dark Half is a film that had a ton of potential in the beginning- you see a little boy who enjoys writing . One day while his mother sends him off to school , she looks outside the window of her home and sees her son fall to the ground and have a seizure before getting on the school bus.Then suddenly , while at the hospital , a flock of sparrows bang against the window . So far the story sounds like it 'd pack a SERIOUS amount of suspense , but then ... They flash ahead 23 years later when the boy becomes an adult and *then* the actual storyline kicks in.This actually completely destroys the suspense and the potential the storyline COULD have had . Now the movie becomes nothing but another boring mystery/detective film involving a writer and a series of murders . The head cop is convinced the writer is connected to all the murders taking place , but he just ca n't prove it . That about covers what the storyline is about . Giving the writer a family ( wife and two babies ) was just totally pointless and did nothing of interest to make the storyline any better.Unfortunately the constant appearances by the sparrow flocks ( always appearing at the silliest times ) , the poetic and unbelievable flow of the overdramatic plotline , and the poor writing add up to one MAJOR disappointment . This is the only Stephen King film I ca n't get into no matter how hard I try . All the characters are just so boring it becomes a chore watching the movie . A fairly generic storyline by Stephen King 's standards does n't help matters either . Come on , he 's certainly capable of coming up with something better than this . Just ... really bland .	-1
There may be something that one can glean from KILLER 'S KISS , but I think it will be lost on anyone that is not already a die-hard , Kubrick fan . That is to say , if you have n't seen any of Stanley Kubrick 's films , do not start with this one under any circumstances . I kept asking for more . The fact that Kubrick had directed it raised my standards far too high . I kept waiting for a complexity in the story to arise , for the characters to grow some depth , for the subtle `` turn '' in the plot . But nothing ever came . And then the film ended , after only 67 minutes . As the credits rolled , I sat there in shock before finally muttering : `` I guess that was it . `` Of course , there are some highlights in the film . The lighting is great , the shots are nice , etc . But compared to his later work , KILLER 'S KISS fails to meet the director 's own standards . So what is the use in seeing this film ? I agree with one reviewer who commented that this film is like an artist 's early `` throwaway '' sketches . While you can catch glimpses of Kubrick 's later glory , on the whole the film lacks heart and should have been left on the drawing board . But a star does not emerge overnight-we must take his early , inexperienced work with his later masterpieces . Thus , if you are interested in Kubrick , the director , you might enjoy dipping back into his filmography to see where he came from . But if you are interested in catching a good noir , I would recommend over a dozen films before KILLER 'S KISS would even make the list .	-1
Which `` Hitchcock '' inspired this ? Some of Alfred 's camera work , perhaps , the sort that has become a cliche in serial killer flicks . This script , however , has far less subtlety than `` Seven '' and few surprises . Moreau is always appealing in some way , but she is so businesslike in this role that the apparent fascination that her victims show for her is not credible even as comic parody of predatory men . Two of the revenge killings had promising storylines . One of these worked well . In the second she was an artist 's model in a character that parodied the men , but the parody was n't highlighted , the episode missed opportunities for added interest and thus seemed too long for nothing . Same for the film .	-1
If ever there was a movie about nothing , this is certainly it . The setting is a small , French town . The characters are the townsfolk , many of whom are school kids . The story ... .Well , there IS no story . This is a movie about absolutely nothing that goes on for an hour and 45 minutes ! It 's incredible that this made it to DVD and at this point , Amy Tan 's & quot ; The Joy Luck Club & quot ; hasn't.Maybe this was someone 's idea of a joke ? If so , I want my 18 bucks back . My wife and kids are laughing at me for having bought this DVD . I 'm not kidding . I could have made a better French movie . Even the translation stunk.Good grief !	-1
there are just so many nasty parts in this movie.if they would of left those out , i would have liked this movie.like when woody harrelson threw up.and when randy quaid was flossing and chunks of food flew everywhere and all over the mirror .	-1
For some reason , a good friend of mine recommended this film to me ... probably because he knows I like to go bowling . The little bit of bowling that takes place in this movie is about the only thing worth while ... and when it comes down to it , nothing is really worth while in this mind-numbing flick.Roy Munson ( Woody Harrelson ) was groomed by his father from the time he was a young child to be a professional bowler . As he reaches adulthood in the late 70s , he quickly becomes well known as the best bowler in the state , and the hero of his home town of Ocelot.He soon teams up with Ernie McCracken ( Bill Murray ) , a bitter , manipulative con man who would be the top bowler if it were not for Munson.The short-lived partnership turns to tragedy when , thanks to McCracken , Munson is attacked and loses his right hand . This is supposed to be a comedy - even the scene in which he loses his hand is intended to be funny . Do n't get me wrong - I understood the humor , and maybe if I was incredibly drunk , I would laugh - but nothing about someone being permanently disfigured is funny.Non-stop slapstick jokes are used throughout the film , using Munson 's prosthetic hook . This worked in the Peter Pan re-make , & quot ; Hook , & quot ; but does not work here.The film fast forwards to 17 years after his disfigurement an not much has changed - he has been drinking himself into sorrow the entire time . This is also made out to be a comedic element - a man so devastated , that he drinks his life away in utter despair and loneliness . Funny , huh ? Even though he ca n't bowl , he loves the bowling experience and is a struggling salesman to bowling alleys . During a sales call , he encounters Ishmael Boorg ( Dennis Quaid ) , an Amish farmer who has snuck to the bowling alley to re-live an experience he had with his grandfather years before.Munson convinces Boorg that he is a bowling genius and that they should go to Reno , Nevada to a million-dollar bowling tournament.A worldly , drunk , selfish man takes a selfless , naive Amish farmer across the country in a beat-up wreck ... a recipe for humor , right ? About every cliche you can think of happens - before the film is over , Ishmael has been dressed in drag , gotten drunk , gotten grotesque tattoos and been in fist fights . As though it were by osmosis , Munson suddenly becomes less selfish and suddenly sober.The viewer is bombarded with tasteless gags , disgusting bedroom humor , implied animal abuse , and foul bathroom humor.I have a great sense of humor , which is why this film did nothing to provoke me to laughter.The acting was as good as it could have been in such a story . Like another slapstick , bathroom-humor film , & quot ; There 's Something About Mary , & quot ; the Farrelly brothers try to have a tongue-in-cheek approach to this movie . The characters are almost winking at the audience . The difference is that in & quot ; There 's Something About Mary , & quot ; the comedic timing worked and the gags were not predictable.In order to rally bowling fans to see the film , many pro bowlers , including the legendary Mark Roth , are given cameo appearances - but none of them have more than 1 or 2 seconds of screen time and none of them have any dialogue.This film is a true waste of celluloid and talent ... and worse , a waste of time to watch .	-1
Except for the drug addict , there was little emotion shown in this overlong , plodding tale of robotic actors . Mumbling their lines , pausing too long for vacant stares that were supposed to show deep thinking or feeling , the actors showed nothing worth watching and no one with whom one could identify . The mass production of honey was mildly interesting for those interested in such things . The main character , the aging , emaciated Fonda , was the personification of end-stage depression as he slowly went about his bee-keeping honey business . When confronted by the bad guys , one almost thinks he wants them to end his miserable life , and they nearly do at the ending . Do n't watch this miserable waste of time .	-1
What seemed to have worked so well in `` Coffy '' just does n't here . Yes , we get to see Pam Grier , and she 's fine , but the script just does n't give her a whole lot to do . Furthermore , the villain in this one just is n't scary , with her overwrought lines and lame `` I 'm in charge '' banter ; the sleazeball from `` Coffy '' was better because we did n't know exactly how the chips were going to fall until the very end . That tension is missing here , save for one scene where Grier is tortured and abandoned in a gruesome way . We actually get to feel a little tension.However , I still feel that this below-average `` follow-up '' is more than a little disappointing , especially since `` Coffy '' really set a high bar , with a great cast driven by a lot of exciting dialogue and plot twists . See this only if you just need to watch another Grier vehicle because it 's just not as good .	-1
The movie started out poorly and went downhill from there . The acting was less than stellar . The plot was soporific . I quit watching about half way through waiting for it to get better .	-1
I love DVDs and watching movies . This is one I wish I had never seen , and there are not too many of those . If you are tempted to buy it please please please rent it first and use the money you saved to buy a good movie !	-1
I do n't like to review a lot of movies but had to write something about this one . One of the worst 15 movies ever made . If you want to watch a movie for its accents , that 's disturbing . I suggestif you 're so much into accents go visit the place and , talk to the real people over ther . It will be much more rewarding . - '' for a little bit of money , there is more to life than money '' - I think that 's been known for a longtime now . I would say for sure at least since 1932 . Money ca n't buy you love , anyone . It looks like this movie is favored by teenagers who are learning about life . The gore in this movie is in there to make the crowd feel good by them thinking , 'that 's how reality is , real crime is like that , now people will understamd what real crime is , after watching this movie '' By making the story disconecting , they are trying to make those who are watching the movie feel smart , because the audience think that there has to be some kind of message or point to all this boredom , stupidity , confusion , meaningless action , nonaction etc . Even by watching a rock get hit repeatedly by wave after wave of ocean water one can finally make oneself believe that those waves hitting that rock has an important meaning in life .	-1
I started to watch this movie but it is such a lousy movie that I had to stop watching . That was a surprise because I usually like De Niro movies .	-1
I always found this film boring . Aside from a great chase sequence , there 's really nothing too memorable about it . The title has always irked me . There 's a reference to the 47 Ronin here , but the only reason that I can think of as to why it was included in this film was just for the screenwriter to make himself feel superior . The story of the 47 Ronin has nothing to do with the characters here . Ronin is a term meaning masterless samurai . It initiated between 2 Lords , Asano and Kira . Kira was an older master , and he treated Asano very shabbily . Asano had tried to please Kira , but lost his temper and attacked Asano with a dagger . Asano did no real damage , but an attack like this was forbidden by the laws at the time . Asano was ordered to commit seppuku , which he did , but Kira escaped punishment . Out of Asano 's 300 Samurai , 47 decided to take revenge for this injustice . They killed Kira , and then they themselves were executed , but they became heroes and remain heroes to this day in Japan and around the world.The story of the 47 Ronin is much more complex and powerful than anything in this film . This film is really a mediocre thriller that has a great chase scene in it . You can safely skip this one , and read a book on the 47 Ronin ...	-1
I do n't care what he does - he ca n't do wrong in my book . Comedy , drama , action - it does n't appear that he can not transform himself to fit any role . I 'd call that talent , skill , professionalism , ability , flexibility , too many positive adjectives to type here.I did n't even watch the on-line version but I did watch the movie nearer the time it was originally released . I just remember that the movie never disappoints and it seems like he brings his co-actors into a higher state of performance . Nothing really specific for you to latch on to in my remarks but talent is talent . Period.Buy it , watch it , enjoy it , in that order : ) I bought it , could n't watch it , could n't enjoy it . The first disc , with the movie on it , would n't play in any of my players - it would n't load or display anything . Of course since I did n't open and try to watch it until after the refund period I got screwed on this purchase . No refund , no movie.From now on , try every product you purchase from ANYWHERE within the first week ...	-1
The Silence of The Lambs is an extremely well written and realized film . I bought the 2 disc collector 's edition and I was not disappointed by the film transfer or the extras which are extremely in-depth and interesting.The Blu-Ray is a disappointment because all the extras that were on the 2 disc collector 's edition are NOT ported over as I 've read in other reviews . There is a 3 part interview solely with Demme and Foster which is not on the Blu-Ray.A major reason to upgrade is picture quality AND the behind the scenes featurettes , and commentaries that most studios are actually taking time and care to produce . There was nothing wrong with the collector 's edition transfer.Had I known before hand , and I do read and take note as to whether or not the Blu disc contains the same extras as the CE ( hence my not bothering to purchase the Blu-Rays of classics like The Thing , and The Usual Suspects ) I would not have made the purchase.I 'm sure that at some point in the near future complete versions of existing bare-bones Blu-Rays will appear with the collector 's edition extras.Studios should take care and note that DVD picture quality is now extremely cost effective , and acceptable . Blu is better but not at the c-o-s-t of the featurettes and commentaries .	-1
I am not going to discuss the movie itself because I agree with most of you that this movie is so GREAT.But this `` Criterion Collection '' is an expensive DVD that should at least satisfy us ! Well guess what , it is not DTS , it is not 5.1 channels , IT IS 2.0 CHANNELS ! Not only that , there is no subtitles and the deleted scenes are so worthless ! The best thing I liked about this DVD was the Voices of Death & FBI Crime Files , which are so great but can never justify the high price or the `` Criterion Collection '' title !	-1
This is a movie I was looking forward to on BD . Unfortunately my Panasonic BD player does not play the disc . There seems to be a compatibility problem with Blu Ray discs and older BD machines . I wo n't be buying Blu Ray anymore as I have no certainty it will play on my player that I bought for 1000 EUR ( ! ! ) 2 years ago . Way to go Panasonic and BD Association ! Get your standards set before you launch a product !	-1
Lightning releases killer worms on unsuspecting locals including scantly clad girls.This film polarizes people 's opinions . It is either so awful that you like it or so awful that you do n't like it . I personal found it difficult to complete . You could easily mistake this for a Lucas film . It has family interaction , a down to earth challenge , and an electrifying effect on the landscape . There are several `` stay in the car scenes '' and plenty of opportunities to say , `` do n't do that '' .So reiterating , for some people it will worm its way into their harts ; for their people it is a gross opportunity .	-1
A horribly boring horror ... .geeze ... the conversations that they have are so stupid , and then the wormsdevours the town ... .and they make them all one bunch ... a swarm of worms ... that sound like a Sesame Street horn when they move ... ..Ah ! A Worm ... . ( stomp ) ... lol	-1
This was painful to watch . I wanted it to end . NOT funny , maybe some parts were , but that does n't make up for the pathetic story line and characters . Twilight is a better comedy then this ! ! Watch the Hangover , Horrible Bosses or just about any other comedy then this , as I 'm sure it will be 100 % better then anything this could produce .	-1
There was really only one selling point for this movie to begin with , and that would have to of been the fact Claire Danes was in the movie . The fact that I only wish that I had slept through it is another matter . Save your money , go buy something else . I have no time to bash or flame , just to say that I am disappointed with a boring movie .	-1
It took me three sittings to sit through most of Navy Seals , and I still dozed off through a few minutes of it . Yes , boredum the movie 's biggest problem . This is by far the dullest action movie I 've seen in years , maybe even of all-time.What 's the plot ? Who cares ? It 's just bare bones enough to string up some action sequences , but unfortunately , the action scenes smell of made-for-TV quality . Heck , some of the stuff that 's made-for-TV these days features better action ( i.e . Band of Brothers ) . Director Lewis Teague obviously does n't know much more than the good old point-and-shoot method , meaning he 's got no style or , for that matter , a sense of direction . People shoot , get shot , and it 's a basic , routine pattern that continues for all the gunfights . There are no cool stunts , outrageous situations , or edgy tension during all these scenes.The way it is for me is that movies involving commando teams are rarely ever exciting , mainly because it 's a bunch of tough guys who seem invincible , even when a couple of them get killed . Oh , do n't get me wrong , there are notable exceptions ( such as the nail-biter Executive Decision ) , but Navy Seals sure is n't one of them . The film never builds up any suspense because the villains never seem like a threat . None of the bad guys are even the slightest bit menacing . Already , at least half the movie 's effectiveness is gone.But the `` heroes '' are just as lame and uninteresting . For these parts , acting 's what you 'd expect . Charlie Sheen plays himself , annoying and idiotic as usual . Michael Biehn is the tough-as-nails commander , a role he can do in his sleep , though he plays the part so straight he might just induce some sleep in the viewers . Nobody else makes an impression , not even the usually funny Bill Paxton.I do n't have much more to say about Navy Seals , other than its third-rate , silly crap that fails on every intended level . It 's dull plot and premise wo n't make this an enjoyable movie to trash in a crowd , and its boring execution will put a lot of viewers to sleep . Definitely one of the nadirs of awful modern action filmmaking.1/2 out of *****	-1
The lineup of cast members are really impressive , minus Charlie Sheen , who again makes it to the script 's boat motor and pulls and pulls the string , breaking it . My two fav actors are Biehn and Paxton ( real life friends ) and I must say that this flick was not worthy of the cast , especially these two . Joanne Whaley , Cyril O'Reiley , and Rick Rossovich , also good actors , were wasted . Some scenes , like the debut of their skills , during the rescue of the remaining 2 American G.I . 's , and the skydive to the coast , were great . Too many of the other action scenes were not believable or tactically true . Biehn is always on the ball , although his dialouge and scrpit matter fail to let him shine . Dennis Ranbert , too bad he was knocked off by Sheen 's carelessness . And then Hawkin 's is still allowed to be on the team ? Is the script stupid or what ? I vote for a remake , but with the same cast-I know they 're older , bu so what . And the lines by Sheen ? He 's not THAT bad ... and it 's not his fault : it 's the scriptwriter and producers ! Sheen just seems to eat up the dialouge like a dinner-he really seems to be having fun with the garbage can script.Biehn : `` Cool off ! `` Sheen : `` You should see me when I 'm hot ! `` Rescue the cast and put this NAVY adventure in a kiddie pool with water guns .	-1
I 'm not reviewing the movie here , but rather the quality of the blu-ray version . While the picture quality is adequate , the sound is simply horrible . I also have Navy Seals on DVD and the sound is great , but on the blu-ray the voices are extremely low in volume compared to the other sounds . ( like the gunfire/explosions ) It 's unwatchable !	-1
What the heck was this mess ? A three hour movie with no plot until over half way through ? Voice overs like a Godzilla movie and lame dialog . This must have been awesome for Clint Eastwood because he has only about 10 minutes of dialog in the whole movie . My wife and I watched this whole movie just to see if the ending made it , but nope ... we could n't figure out why this movie is so popular . The only think I can come up with is the music . There is just nothing here , and its so long and boring . Ugh , next time I 'll watch static for a more entertainment .	-1
the good , bad and ugly disc on this three disc collection is flawed ... .it will not play and jammed my DVD player ... .reading `` disc is dirty '' ... .so I sent back the trilogy , and received a new one ... .and that new disc did the same thing ... would not play and jammed my DVD ... ..the others were ok..	-1
I have bought this dvd because I read other reviews and I understood that the quality of this edition was very good . This is one of my favourite movies and I was very unhappy with the original VHS I had . To my surprise I found out that the quality of the dvd was not better . The movie is presented in a letterbox format but the information that we are given ( even on the dvd 's case ) is Widescreen ! ! ! Try it on a good DLP projector and see yourself the difference ... This is the worse quality I have ever seen . I do n't know if I am more ungry with MGM or with the customers that wrote the reviews I read . If you are not able to appraise the real quality of a product do us a favour : keep your opinion for yourselves !	-1
I think it is one of the weaker of the WWII films . It does , however , portray an important incident in the defeat of Germany and is valuable from an historical point of view.My main objection is in the depiction of the American soldiers . They sem to be a surly lot , bickering and throwing digs at each other ; but who knows , oerhaps that was the case . The Germans seemed to be a better organized group even though they lost the battle.But is it nowhere near s bad as & quot ; The Battle of the Bulge. & quot ; That bummer rates a minus five stars .	-1
When I read the intial reviews of this film , I knew that it was not going to last long in the theatres so I rushed out to see it , fearing that it would be yanked and disappear forever . I was right , as it left my local theatre the next week and most national movie chains the week after . I was the only one in the theatre ! What I saw was the movie on a big screen . Here is what I thought : It was a gorgeously filmed , beautifully scored mess with a few striking set pieces ( the roller skating scene , etc. ) . It was almost impossible to figure out . I still have little idea what the early scenes in harvard have to do with the rest of the film or why the prostitute ( idealized by Hollywood , as usual ) had such a large , meaningless role . I also have no idea why the peasants were shot . The movie either does n't explain these things or does so in such vague ways that you will miss them . Much of the dialogue was unintelligible ! The dialogue soundtrack was muddy and the acting appeared to be drug influenced ( later stories about the filming stated that drug use was widespread on the set ) . If you have nothing better to do , you might get a kick out this for the big scenes but have your fast forward button close by , you will need it . A bewildering , sometimes stunning , often tedious film .	-1
`` Heaven 's Gate '' is remembered today as `` the film that sank United Artists '' and one of Hollywood 's all-time biggest box office disasters . Written and directed by Michael Cimino shortly after his success with `` The Deer Hunter '' , its budget escalated from $ 7.8 million to over $ 40 million when UA , in a shockingly shortsighted contract , allowed Cimino unlimited cost overruns . Cimino shot an outrageous 1.3 million feet of film and edited the film to 5 hours and 25 minutes , then to the 3 hour 39 minute version on this DVD for the premiere in November 1980 . It was almost universally panned by critics . A 2 1/2 hour cut was widely released to theaters and all but ignored by filmgoers . Michael Cimino 's career was essentially over , as was United Artists shortly thereafter.I was prepared to like this film . American critics in 1980 thought that it had no redeeming value . French critics years later praised it to the heavens . I thought the truth might be somewhere in between : a mediocre film that suffers from excessive length . The Americans may have punished the film for Cimino 's behavior . The French make a point of loving everything Americans hate . Perhaps the shorter cut that flopped at the box office was too short for the style in which it was filmed . No such luck . When I finally saw `` Heaven 's Gate '' , it was worse than I expected . In addition to the litany of problems with the film itself , this is a terrible script . If it had not undone United Artists and served as a symbol of artistic self-indulgence , `` Heaven 's Gate '' would not be remembered at all.In Johnson County , Wyoming 1892 , an organization of wealthy ranchers , the Stock Growers Association , is frustrated with the tide of homesteading immigrants who are poaching their cattle . Under the leadership of the well-connected Frank Canton ( Sam Waterson ) , the Association draws up a death list of 125 homesteaders and hires 50 mercenaries to execute them . Sheriff Jim Averill ( Kris Kristofferson ) is sympathetic to the plight of the immigrants and tries to ensure the legality of the Association 's actions . The Association 's foreman Nate Champion ( Christopher Walken ) , a rival of Averill 's for the affections of one Ella Watson ( Isabelle Huppert ) , is becoming wary of his employer 's violent means . Angry ranchers , desperate immigrants , and all hell is going to break loose.As to the veracity of the events depicted in `` Heaven 's Gate '' , the Johnson County War really did happen , sort of . The battle between immigrants and mercenaries employed by the Stock Growers Association was averted before it could take place . Many of the characters in the film take their names from real people : Ella Watson , Jim Averill , Frank Canton , Nate Champion , W.C. Irvine . But the roles they play in the film are entirely different from those in reality . Watson and Averill were dead by 1892 . So the film is fictional except for the general circumstances of the conflict in Johnson County . `` Heaven 's Gate '' consists of scenes that run too long and scenes whose purpose is mysterious . There is just a lot of footage that does n't accomplish much . The dialogue is corny and cliched . One major fault is that the film fails to make the immigrants sympathetic . They are an unruly cabal of hot-headed peasants whom we never know and certainly never like . Another failure is that Jim Averill is entirely opaque . We do n't have any idea why he is in Wyoming or why he does anything . I ca n't imagine why Canton is hauling Billy Irvine , a drunken thorn in his side , around with him either . Actually , I do n't know why Irvine is in the movie . This film is just like that . It does n't make sense.When people ca n't find anything else good to say about `` Heaven 's Gate '' , they praise Zigmos Dsigmond 's cinematography . He is one of the great talents of his era . This film is in color but almost sepia-toned , so brown is the predominant color . In the print that I saw , the brown had an unwelcome pink undertone . I do n't know if it 's a problem with the transfer or if the film really looked like that . There is much artistic rendering of dust or , less commonly , smoke . For 3 hours , I wondered how Zigmos Dsigmond kept the dust out of his camera . There is no denying that Dsigmond 's photography looks good if I ignore the pink . ( The pink was bad judgment if it was intentional . ) But this is n't his best work , and it is very self-conscious at times.Whatever its faults -and they are many- `` Heaven 's Gate '' ultimately fails because no one or thing in the film is compelling . It has compelling moments , but they are fleeting . Each time I saw one , I hoped the film would take off from there . It never happened . This is basically 3 3/4 hours of texture . A script with bad dialogue , nebulous characters , and actions without motivation should never have been green-lighted . In his book `` Final Cut '' , Stephen Bach , who was one of UA 's heads of production , places blame for the film mostly on Michael Cimino . I do n't dispute that , but Cimino would n't have had the opportunity to run amok if Bach had not liked this lousy script . The only bonus feature on the MGM 2000 DVD is a theatrical trailer ( 1 min ) . Subtitles are available in French and Spanish .	-1
Just watch , study , and learn and you will see how to make a bad 'Western ' movie . Back 31-years ago , it 's hard to figure what exactly just what went wrong , but here goes : bad script , bad screenplay , bad directing , bad editing . What a long , boring film ! The incidental scenes were totally unnecessary ; and added NOTHING to the film as a whole . The whole thing could have been accomplished as a 30-minute short story , and that is problematic for the whole effect . Just how long does it take to walk through a door ? ... or to put on a jacket ? ... or to mount a horse ? ... or to open a bottle ? The incidentals are what KILL this film . I know in the '70 's , that realism was the key to good directing and production ; but one can watch and appreciate only so much 'realism ' in a film , in a story , without wanting it to be concluded . Christopher Walken looks like a 'martian ' and will ALWAYS look like a martian . He was the WRONG choice for Nate Champion . AS for the rest of the cast , anyone could have pulled it off easily . It 's not a complicated story . You 're better off watching `` The Johnson County War '' with Tom Berringer for a more accurate portrayal of events .	-1
This movie is terrible . Just awful.Let 's give credit where it is due . This film looks great . The photography is great and the sets and costumes are great.The picture looks great . But * * *The story of this movie is very poorly told , barely told , really . Here is the story . Some rich guy graduates from Harvard in 1870 . He goes west to bring civilization or some such thing to Wyoming . He becomes a law officer in Johnson County , Wy . A bunch of immigrants have moved into the county and become farmers . This upsets the rich cattle interests , because the farmers are taking `` their '' land . So the rich guys decides to run the immigrant farmers out of the area , or to just plain kill them . The farmers are a sympathetic group and they are not doing well financially . Many are starving . The cattle men are scum and they are rich . So we have the ingredients for a good movie . But what we get is just awful.Here is why this movie is awful . It takes forever for the movie to make a point , to tell just part of the story , to communicate what is going on . It reminded me of the late comedian Andy Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby to his audiences during his stand up act . The audience hated it because , after a very short time , there was no point to it . That is what Heaven 's Gate is all about -- not making a point or taking forever to make a point . This horrible movie just goes on and on and on and on.I could not even figure out why the movie is called Heaven 's Gate . There is a roller skating rink in the movie by that name but I ca n't figure out why that was the film 's title . It could just as easily been called Hell 's Bells . Or This Movie Smells.Watching this movie is like watching the paint , on a beautiful picture , take forever to dry .	-1
Despite the big named actors in this film and director Ronald Neame , this movie is surpisingly bad . Neame , who just passed away in June of this year , directed such classics asTunes of Glory - Criterion CollectionandThe Poseidon Adventure ( Special Edition ) apparently just could n't do anything to make Meteor even an entertaining film . The film picks up for the last half hour , but it was too late to save this less than mediocre film .	-1
This movie really depresses me . The scenery , the acting , the old songs . BLEAH !	-1
The Bagdad Cafe is a wonderful movie . The problem here is that this version ( 95 minutes ) has cut out over 10 minutes of the film . Nowhere did it say that this version was edited . I feel that I am a victim of false advertising . I checked Amazon to see if I could purchase the German version ( 108 minutes ) , which is the full feature . The other box with a different picture does not say run time or if it is the German cut . Bad , Bad , Bad ! I usually give reviews on something I liked or if it was a good specific gift . I ca n't let this one get by without stating my disappointment .	-1
Pretentiously morbid and opulently crafted . Not for me .	-1
Pregnant Louisa ( Chloe Webb ) spoke the above line to her husband , the architect Kracklite ( what a name - played by Brian Dennehy ) when he asked where she was going to go , when she announced she was leaving him ... she then proceeded to tell him where she was going ( to live with his nemesis who would take care of her until the baby was born - apparently after that he would throw her and the baby out ) . Louisa told her husband she was leaving him because she did n't want to `` drop '' the child too soon - because she was due in a month and his exhibition was in twelve days . Her character definitely did not have a way with words or common sense . I could n't believe such horrible writing existed , but Ms. Webb 's acting is even worse - I mean much , much worse than a first grade play.Dennehy is an architect in Rome , who becomes ill , and even his own doctor is mean to him , showing him ( he has the busts ) how other artist 's died `` foolish '' deaths ( in his opinion ) . In my opinion , they just died . Maybe the doctor was trying to say that they lived their lives foolishly , but as I said , it 's bad writing.No wonder I never heard of this movie . It 's awful . Dennehy is the only decent actor , so that he looks and sounds absolutely wonderful in comparison to everyone else , but he ca n't save this junk .	-1
This is a cult-classic ! Unfortunately , it was released on a disc ofpoor quality.It wo n't play in any of my DVD-players.Not Happy	-1
A somewhat admirable but sadly disappointing attempt to bring gothic vampirism into the 70s , Count Yorga Vampire lacks the suspense , action , and plot necessary to make the endeavor work . Robert Quarry stars as the title character , a Bulgarian bloodsucker who poses as a medium to ensnare new victims . Quarry 's performance is one of the film 's strong points , alluring yet undeniably monstrous . Some effort is taken to make the victims into more than statistics ; the movie looks at their lives and interraction in surprising detail for this sort of movie . Unfortunately this actually works against the film , as the protagonists are actually a rather boring , infantile set of 70s dullards who fail to inspire much compassion in the viewer . As a result , the shock ending , which should leave the viewer with a last electric jolt of fear , is more of a period than an exclamation point and does n't really carry much impact . In fairness , the lack of quality performances is due more to mediocre characterization and dialogue in the script than due to any fault on the part of the actors , who seem to give their roles an honest effort . Finally , the special effects are weak and as is typical of many vampire flicks , the vampires seem to just miraculously impale themselves on every wooden point in sight . This is n't the worst vampire movie out there , but I ca n't recommend anyone buying it . Aside from Quarry 's magnificent performance , Count Yorga Vampire is a rather slow , emotionless bag of missed opportunities .	-1
Boris Karloff 's sinister presence can not save this disappointing H.P . Lovecraft adaptation . & # 34 ; Die , Monster , Die ! & # 34 ; plods along until its effective climax , with mad scientist Boris disintegrating in classic fashion . The AIP production is somewhat reminiscent of Karloff 's 1936 sci-fi thriller & # 34 ; The Invisible Ray. & # 34 ; Though he was determined to keep working , the aging horror icon should have been more selective in his choice of projects .	-1
Maybe somebody can invent a word for a movie that has `` scenes too shocking to be shown in theaters '' , but yet the scenes are shown in theaters when the movie was originally released ; but when the DVD of the movie comes out all the `` scenes too shocking to be shown in theaters '' are edited out of the DVD . This is the second DVD that I bought ( The Mad Bomber being the other ) where what you get in the theater is the unedited , uncut version , but what you get on the DVD has all the good & most memorable stuff ( think sex & nudity , with perhaps some violence and so-called disturbing images ) edited out.A nationally known reviewer ( aka Roger Ebert ) listed Invasion of the Bee Girls ( along with Emmanuelle and other movies that I forgot ) on his list of Guilty Pleasures , but I 'm sure that he saw a very different Bee Girls . I do n't know for certain that all the good stuff was edited out of the DVD , because I never saw the original Invasion of the Bee Girls when it first came out in theaters in '74 , but my 6th sense tells me that all the honey and all the honeys have been edited out of the Bee Girls on the DVD .	-1
`` The People That Time Forgot '' ( 1977 ) is the sequel to `` The Land That Time Forgot ( 1975 ) . Both titles were borrowed from Edgar Rice Burroughs along with the basic premise , a prehistoric tropical paradise in the heart of Antarctica ; inhabited by dinosaurs and cavemen . Burroughs detailed how volcanic activity kept the region warm and how a rim of mountains protected the land from the frozen temperatures that surrounded it . The film does not bother to include these scientific details nor much else from the original Burrough 's stories so do n't think less of him just because some hacks borrowed his idea and make this movie.The movie features an expedition to find Bowen Tyler ( Doug McClure ) the main character in the 1975 film . The rescue effort is not exactly massive , it is a tiny four person expedition led by Tyler 's childhood friend Major Ben McBride ( John Wayne 's son Patrick ) . The pairing of these two actors was probably an effort to demonstrate to the world that there was actually an actor out there with less talent than McClure . Wayne peaked at age 18 with a bit part as the youthful Lt. Greenhill in his dad 's film `` The Searchers '' and mysteriously managed to find a succession of acting opportunities in vehicles so bad that even he could not damage them to any great extent.The bottom line is that this movie works best as a mock party feature ; complete with laughably bad special effects , Saturday matin & eacute ; e serial quality production design , and high school play quality acting . Also good for some laughs is Dana Gillespie as cave girl exploitation element Ajor . Dana was a British singer , best remembered not for her tunes but for her lingerie clad presence on the cover of her album `` Were n't Born a Man '' . Despite her enormous talents I always thought she looked too `` Butch '' .A young Sarah Douglas ( of `` Superman '' fame ) plays the newspaper reporter accompanying the expedition . Douglas was extremely beautiful at that age and has a fair degree of acting ability as well . I 'm not sure what is the most out of place , a classy young woman heading into the jungle with this group or a competent actress being included in this lame ensemble.Then again , what do I know ? I 'm only a child .	-1
THIS IS THE PETER FONDA MOVIE BEFORE EASYRIDER , IT IS LOOSLEY BASED ON THE ADVENTURES OF THE RED AND WHITE IN THE 60 'S ITS ONE OF THE VERY FEW MOVIES THAT NANCY SINATRA WAS IN ( THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING FAME ) AND ALSO STARS BRUCE DERN , IT 'S OKAY BUT NOTHING TO RIGHT HOME ABOUT .	-1

The painter Goya said : `` When reason sleeps , monsters are born . '' This movie seeks to silence the critical faculties of the mind . It is hard to take seriously something which makes no sense . The Mother Superior in Calcutta ( and in the movie there is nothing to make one think that these are `` Protestants '' as some say , perhaps basing themselves on the book ) sends into a difficult situation a nun which she and Sister C. wonder about and both see as a problem . Nun goes mad , not surprising , they all forsaw the possibility , and they got what they wanted . So , logically , the Mother Superior is a fool . If you do n't think so , then something very deep must be going on . But , unfortunately , it is obvious that she is a fool if taken seriously , or that things do n't make sense , then it is not deep , it is just silly , or really , somewhat sinister . And in the movie , nothing makes sense . As the `` old general '' says , Europeans want sausages , so that is what the nuns are going eat ; sausages when they arrive , when they are there , and when they leave . This is more or less a direct quote . He is quite right . So , as the script says , Everyone , but Everyone is to be fed baloney . The Nunnery ( formerly a monastery , and before that a really deluxe brothel , no kidding ) is set at a high altitude , thousands of feet up , but surrounded by tropics reached by a few steps . Not real . You ca n't have it both ways . It is either at 8,000 feet or a jungle , but not both . The Nuns complain about the bad plumbing . Yeah . right , plumbing . The wind is supposedly always blowing but never ruffles anything . It is supposed to be cold , but the resident Englishman wears short hot pants , short sleeves , or no shirt , but a fur lined vest . The Nun who goes mad appears with her hair done . ( Hairdressers in the remote himalayas ? ) Which becomes undone minutes later when she unsuccesfully pushes Deborah Kerr off the cliff . The bell is set next to a cliff with a drop of , oh thousands of feet ; a perfect place to put the bell . The mad ex-nun , crazed by jealousy and desire , falls off instead of Deborah Kerr.The `` old general 's '' uncle is a catatonic `` holy man , '' acually a member of the Order of the British Empire , who sits and stares into space all day . The young `` general '' comes and sits with children to learn `` physics '' and `` Russian '' in the nunnery school . We see him learning French , very badly , of course . The Nun 's school teaching basic literacy in this underdeveloped setting happens to include French lessons . Of course everyone should speak French , but that is obviously ridiculous in that situation . This is more than Nutty but not surreal . Reminiscent of the `` English Patient '' who is dragged with the army from Egypt to Italy , along with the army on the front line instead of being sent away from the front lines to a hospital , and an army nurse who decides she is going to stay put in a nice villa and care for one patient only ; desertion ? What nonsense ! The nunnery , actually , is quite luxurious , a sort of Shangri-La . It really should not have been difficult for the nuns to make a nice go of it , send regular progress reports , and enjoy the scenery , the view . Better than Calcutta , really . Here a nun can even get a fetching red cocktail dress mail order delivered by post . ( Sister Ruth gets just that . ) The movie runs on the melodrama of sex-crazed nuns . Now the National Enquirer will not accept certain kinds of explicit ads ; this is because the people who read it think that they reading something like the New York Times , and the National Enquirer does not want to break the spell . People who enjoy this movie are actually kidding themselves ; it is lurid , and was meant to be lurid , while disguising its real intentions under the pure white habits of the nuns and the wan smile and alarmed looks of Deborah Kerr . The device which makes it succeed , with those with whom it does succeed , is that they are indulging in an unseemly pot-boiler while pretending to be innocent.Now , if it were supposed to be a `` Cabinet of Dr Caligari '' where it turns out everyone is the inmate of an insane asylum , the old General , the young general , the natives , the Holy man , certainly the nuns , including Deborah Kerr , that would make artistic sense . But here , there is no way out ; the viewer who takes this seriously , is also part of the asylum . The sets are very good , the technicolor is beautiful . But to enjoy it one has to enjoy unreality and lack critical judgement . The Anglo-Catholic bit is neither here nor there ; it was just meant to make it easier for the British market to swallow the very idea . This is , of course , not a `` helpful '' review for those who want live an illusion . But waking up is better than a bad dream , even a technicolor one.In Indian movies , one can show thirty dancers , dressed , simulating intercourse . But you can not show two people kissing . When that was done by an American actor on stage in an attempt to shatter a taboo , the reaction was shock and anger and possibly riots . In Black Narcissus the numerous illogicalities are deliberate to disorient and confuse the mind . It allows the viewer to enjoy forbidden feelings , lust and sadism , and yet deceive themselves into thinking that they were engaged in some innocent activity . The movie peddles self delusion . In that sense Black Narcissus is as great as , say , Triumph of the Will . As a fantasy it is unhealthy . But it is very interesting to see such delusion in action .	-1
This movie did not make a lot of sense to us . Maybe we are not that keen on that period of history , but it was tiresome and boring .	-1
Little goodies of dialog like that pollute the supposed tension throughout the film . It might 've be tragic if it was n't so funny . It might 've been funny if it did n't try so hard to be tragic.When I first saw the Lion in Winter in Western Civ class , I thought it was the worst movie I 'd ever seen . The rest of the class seemed to be in agreement . After a second viewing , I offer a full retraction . The story is actually very good , as are most of the performances . Unfortunately the film lacks the focus to be effective . While most of the actors did a good job in his or her own right , the chemistry between characters is on the level of a middle school production of Shakespeare.Some of the scenes have a Python-esque charm to them , but the direction does n't compliment it . And it should n't . It 's not meant to be a spoof , but the more serious scenes lack the intensity of anything better . One of the biggest problems with the film is that it provides no emotional anchor with which the viewer can sympathize . It also sidesteps the personal conflicts in favor of portraying stategy . The result is like watching complete strangers playing chess . Today I also viewed Bergman 's The Seventh Seal for the first time , a movie about a knight who plays chess with Death . It far surpasses this film in every way , shape , and form.If those who made The Lion in Winter understood the material to the degree that Bergman did , this could 've been a great film . As is , it is a valiant attempt but an ultimate failure .	-1
I 've always enjoyed hacking movies , or movies that has a small part of computer freeks doing weird stuff on their PCs . This movie has the best title , but the worst hacking taste.From the beginning , the movie is just inspired from kevin metnick , a small kid who if forbidden from touching anything that has buttons , but thats all about it . The actors are no hackers at all , and the movie depends solely on graphics and visual effects to visualize the hacking and getting into computers , but never I remember seeing a single command line . A simple Change Directory would do at least for Hackers ! Angelina specially didnt look like she knows a thing about computer . Also , the movie shows hackers as magicians who can hack into anything at anytime they want . No knowledge or attempts are needed.This movie might have received good reviews , but for someone looking for hacking movie , and who is a computer freek , I think he is gon na be disappointed.I recommend AntiTrust , the best hackers movie I 've seen .	-1
Probably what the movie writers were thinking.Completely inaccurate description of how hackers operate and how computers work , this movie wants to make you bash your head into the wall . It takes the open-ended view that credit card companies , etc. , are completely stupid and have security systems that my 16-year old cousin could bypass by STUMBLING through it . How outlandish ! & quot ; It 's too much machine for you , & quot ; claims our & quot ; heroine & quot ; as she is speaking to her & quot ; rival , & quot ; played by Jonny Lee Miller . & quot ; What & quot ; is too much machine ? ! ? Is it using a beta-version of Windows 98 ? ! ? Man , that 's got ta floor you if you 're uninitiated ! ! Oh , geez ! And Jonny Lee Miller 's comment on the refresh rate of the display is almost comical ... who can REALLY tell ? I have n't found anybody who can and -- if so -- who cares ? ! ? Here 's my favorite aspect of the movie as clearly illustrated in the scene where they 're trying to find out & quot ; what the bad guy is doing. & quot ; They find out what he 's doing , and & quot ; oooo , that 's not really nice ... we got ta stop this guy. & quot ; And then they find out that Jonny Lee Miller is indeed a killer hacker who did some & quot ; bad & quot ; things himself and they ADMIRE him for it . Where 's the consistency ? Either you like the & quot ; evil & quot ; or you & quot ; hate & quot ; it ... there 's no consistent character background here . I 'm sorry , did I mention that there IS N'T ANY consistency here ? When will Hollywood make a decent computer film where a computer is n't treated as some mystical , mysterious entity surrounded by & quot ; ooo , look it 's a computer & quot ; music , mindless tapping on a keyboard , actor ( s ) staring at the screen with rapt attention , and with surreal displays only found on celluloid ? If you 're looking for mindless plot , inaccurate technology displays , bland characterization emphasized by oft-times overly-annoying geekish behavior mixed with techno-music , then this movie could not have been any & quot ; better. & quot ; I weep for you .	-1
The Bottom Line : With its ridiculous villains ( Why Dr. Melfi ? Why ? ) , bland lead , and tired plot , Hackers does n't even manage to be interesting , let alone memorable or good .	-1
Awful . Horrible . Terrible . I could go on.Maybe you have to be a computer science major ( or former one , in my case ) , or just know the slightest bit about computers to know that hacking is n't some virtual-reality trip through pretty graphics on a huge hologram display . Or maybe it 's just common sense.The & quot ; hacking & quot ; is totally unrealistic and it hurt me to watch it . The culture , I 'm sure , is probably also 180 degrees off from what they show in the movie . Seriously , people , who dresses like that ? Who wears their hair like that ? And certainly all hackers are not skateboarders.Were there any good points to this movie ? Matthew Lillard was outrageous in every aspect , and I enjoy his acting ( however ill-fitting it was ) . And , of course , Angelina Jolie , one of the main reasons I bought the DVD.And speaking of the DVD ... it 's all about computers and technology , so it 'll have some cool high-tech special features , right ? Well , if you consider a trailer and scene-selection to be high-tech and amazing , then you got it . And you also probably thought the hacking in the movie was & quot ; cool. & quot ;	-1
When I rented it I thought it was until March 2nd . But the next day it was not in my prime video library . So I can not advise anyone to rent this movie as my experience was not satisfying .	-1
This movie is very funny based on the talent of Micheal Keaton . The plot , theme , etc.. is about a the wife assuming the role of bread-winner . Of course , being raised in those days , I realize that 's not a race between Wonder bread and Sunbeam . Now days we accept this as norm , as the Lemmings that we are . This movie must have been from one of the original feminists ' directives to neuter the American male . It worked well as I give it five stars , NOT !	-1
This may actually be the most completely vapid film I have endured to date . Based on the famous French film of the same name , BREATHLESS offers the story of a wannabe rebel and petty criminal who accidentally kills a police officer -- and promptly goes on the run with the aid of his unsuspecting girlfriend . But where the original constantly surprised , the remake is uninspired , insipid , and about as enjoyable as a root canal.The big problem with the film is Richard Gere . To give him his due , Gere knocks himself out to inject some life into the predictable plot and mindless script , but there 's no way around it : he 's incredibly miscast , and his high-energy attempt to bring it off simply adds to the embarassment . Ultimately , the best thing that can be said for him is that he looks good naked . Valerie Kaprisky operates at much the same level : she too looks good naked , and that 's about all one can say for her one way or another.That aside , the whole thing has the look and feel of a group of people trying desperately to do something `` different '' and `` artistic '' and failing miserably at every turn . The film looks glossy and expensive , but the production designs are never quite on target and the costuming is some of the worst I 've ever seen ; the cinematography is jumpy , but never to any actual point ; and director Jim McBride either does n't know what statement he is trying to make or simply does n't have the skill with which to communicate it . At best , it is all pretentious ; at worst , you wo n't be able to decide between a stiff drink , a pain-killer , or just simply gouging out your eyes so you wo n't have to watch any more . Life is too short as it is ; do n't waste your hours on this one .	-1
this movie was really bad . hardly any plot and it is very 80 's . Do n't waste your time watching this movie .	-1
Terrible	-1
Plan 9 From Outer Space was worse than this steaming pile , but they did n't have the lavish budget to waste that this one did.Every show biz cliche imaginable is dragged out , but in such a clumsy , trying-but-failing-to-be-manipulative way , that your jaw drops to the floor , and you are entertained , almost against your will . Also , there are really spectacular dance scenes , and lots of female flesh for the eyes to feast on.But the story and the dialogue and the direction are stupid . The red haired actor who plays the choreographer also played the Wig Master for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat on an episode of Seinfeld . Kramer somehow misses seeing the show and as consolation , is allowed to walk down Broadway wearing the Tecnicolor Dreamcoat . He is then mistaken for a pimp and arrested . Perhaps that whole sequence was intended as an homage to Showgirls , and one can only wish that Joe Esterhauz could have been arrested for pimpin ' this ridiculous movie .	-1
I sat there watching this thing on some cable channel one night and realised to my self that some of the moral highlights and underlining meaning of this film are truely noble , however the fact that most of this film is nothing but a high budgeted smut film with some pretty terrable acting I ca n't really stomach it . I enjoy Verhoeven 's other films such as Robocop , Total Recall , Starship Troopers , Basic Instinct and some of his other less known films , but this film was just trash . Alot of nudity of un-needed nudity and bad scripting of a rather lacking plot made me gag . As for the moral lession of the film you might as well watch a Kevin Smith film such as Dogma or Clerks to get simular moral messages that are in surprisingly good films . But if you like stuff that you can just sit back and get lost in the amount of titilation and air humping then you 'll probably love this film . I recomend this to pretty much no one .	-1
... only someone emerging from total isolation in a cave somewhere , and then being shown & quot ; Showgirls & quot ; as the first movie they had ever seen in their life , would even consider recommending it to someone else ( and even then it 'd be a stretch ) . Synopsis ? Let 's see - horrible acting , terrible and uninteresting plot , unsympathetic characters . In short , the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE . It 's a shame Amazon wo n't let me give this a ZERO STAR RATING because even that is more than it deserves .	-1
This movie is now promoted as being `` camp '' but not so when it debuted . Even Gina Gershon thought the script was camp , only realizing it was n't shortly after filming started . Bless her professional heart for not quitting . Liz Berkley is not only an awful actress but a horrible dancer . I lost count the number of times she flung out her arms , either in anger or `` dancing . '' Fries over here , ice over there . Her character is supposed to be irrestitable to men & women alike but she looks like a cheap hooker throughout the whole film . Blonde is not her color . And that overbite is not Gene Tieney sexy at all . I have to agree with some of the other reviewers ; her body does n't look so hot when she 's naked , which is frequently . I do n't know why Joe Eszterhaus hates women so much . His films are very mysoginistic . I will give it credit for one of the best ( unintentionally , of course ) movie lines ever . I use it as a joke all the time . `` It 's a versase . '' Versace	-1
This movie is a hoot ! GINA GERSHON is THE only redeeming virtue in this film.SHOWGIRLS , is the first movie that I had ever seen GINA perform in , and I fell in live with her at first glance.The acting , other than GINA , who is playing her role totally tongue-in- cheek is terrible.The script is BAD ! PLEASE HOLLYWOOD GIVE GINA A DECENT SCRIPT !	-1
I thought I 'd give Mel Brooks one more try and was greatly disappointed . Brooks really has n't had an original idea since Blazing Saddles as this movie , like most of his since , have the same old tired gags and jokes over and over .	-1
I only got one laugh out of this whole thing : when they were fast-forwarding the VHS tape . The rest of it was well-meant , but I ca n't understand why this is a `` cult classic . `` Legally , though , I could n't stop wondering why , if the guys from FAMILY GUY were able to do a send-up of the same movie but using all the actual characters , storyline , and Lucas material , why could n't Brooks ? It would have been so much funnier . As it was , John Candy playing a half-human / half-dog probably looked a lot funnier on the page than it wound up being on the screen . Did the law change or something ? Why was Brooks prevented a direct attack but Seth McFarlane allowed one ?	-1
There comes a time as a moviegoer where you watch a shoddy movie by a talented director and be dumbstruck on how he could make such a horrible picture . Such is the case with Mel Brooks . It 's amazing how Mel Brooks could go from creating great comedy classics like `` Young Frankenstein '' ( 1974 ) and `` Blazing Saddles '' ( 1974 ) to producing undignified garbage like `` Spaceballs '' ( 1987 ) .How this pile of horse manure has a huge fanbase is beyond me . Then again , Nickelback has a lot of fans too so one should n't be surprised if a popular piece of crap is endorsed by a legion of fans . What IS a surprise is how terribly unfunny this movie is . I 've watched many comedies that are both popular and critically acclaimed and I never sat through one in complete silence . Watching `` Spaceballs '' is like being a cancer-ridden patient and hearing doctors make jokes about your illness ; it 's painful enough to make you contemplate suicide.People say that the jokes in this movie are hit-and-miss . How about miss-and-failed completely ? I mean , come on : Pizza the Hutt ? Barf ? Yogurt ? Dark Helmet ? Snotty ? Lame `` Planet of the Apes '' and `` Alien '' references at the end ? What is this ? Junior high ? Look , I 'm not expecting a completely tasteful parody but there 's bad taste and jokes that are tastelessly bad . Watching Lone Star duel with Dark Helmet in a blatantly phallic lightsaber duel ( Wow , that 's so funny . Not . ) makes you loan for the days when Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little were destroying backstage sets in the Warner Bros. studio.In `` Spaceballs '' , the central targets of ridicule are , of course , the `` Star Wars '' trilogy and science-fiction in general . Now , I would use ridicule in a very loose sense since the movie is absolutely pathetic as a parody . This movie had a lot of opportunities and ways to ridicule science-fiction and the `` Star Wars '' trilogy in particular ( George Lucas ' riffing of Joseph Campbell mythologies , the constantly bizarre but memorable acting and one-liners , the ridiculously overzealous fans , sci-fi movies ' overemphasis on visual effects instead of characterization , the simplistic good vs. evil plot device , the ongoing `` Star Wars '' vs. `` Star Trek '' feud , the over-analysis of cryptic symbols like the monolith from `` 2001 '' , just to name a few ) and if given a good script , it would have worked.But instead of deconstructing the genre the same way `` Young Frankenstein '' and `` Blazing Saddles '' did to horror and western genres respectively , `` Spaceballs '' just throws one lame joke after another , neither of which is helped by the mediocre performances from the cast . The only joke in the movie that is genuinely funny is the scene where Yogurt sells the `` Spaceballs '' merchandise to the cast , a blatant mockery of the `` Star Wars '' merchandising machine . Too bad none of the other jokes had the same bite or wit.Both a giant missed opportunity and a complete shambles as a comedy , `` Spaceballs '' is a shameful failure that would never be so cherished if it was n't for the director involved in it . Science fiction deserves a better parody than `` Spaceballs '' .Strongest recommendation to avoid .	-1
Man of La Mancha was one of the most exciting stage experiences of the sixties masterfully performed by Richard Kiley and Joan Diener and Joey Faye . But recast with non singers like Sophia Loren and Peter O Toole and you are asking for a disaster . This has got to be one of the worst screen transformations of a Bway musical ever ! Avoid this and see a high school version or road company . It would have to be better !	-1
I have never served in war but I did live through the Vietnam era . I do not not know if Vietnam was any more horrific than Korea or WWII . Certainly , nuclear weapons did not make an appearance . I ca n't imagine that carnage to be worse than the Civil War where Americans stood 10 feet apart and basically blew the tops of each others ' heads off . 750,000 died.To me , Vietnam was a message to Russia/China : & # 34 ; This far but no more. & # 34 ; We lost 58,000 men and women to make the political statement that communism would not stand . This was a heroic act , regardless of strategic and tactical blunders on the field . What this movie does is undercut the huge value of our Vietnam sacrifice by removing all honor and heroism from the story . If all the soldiers are drug-addled psychopaths , maybe what they 're fighting for is suspect . I do believe that the filmmakers are ( partly ) sympathetic to communism and communistic tyrants.We lost Vietnam through cowardly congressional acts that withheld battlefield supplies and reinforcements . Truly heinous . And now we do n't & # 34 ; win & # 34 ; wars , we simply & # 34 ; end & # 34 ; them once political support dries up . The question raised by Platoon is , short of a serious and direct attack on the homeland , does this nation of Obamacare Pajama Boys have the will to ever fight and win another war ? Is there any ideal or ally that we will really fight for ?	-1
Only in Commie-Wood could this piece of garbage left-wing agitprop be lauded as a `` modern day classic '' . As anti-American propaganda , it 's far too crude and obvious to be taken seriously , as it utilizes every last Vietnam cliche ' in the book , depicting American soldiers as drug-addicted , psychotic murderers and rapists , almost to a man . As a drama , it 's extremely lacking- the characters are almost completely interchangeable , and of the few who are fleshed out a bit , I found myself incapable of giving a crap . As entertainment , it 's utterly boring- from start to finish we 're subjected to unceasing and monotonous killing and depravity . You could leave the room for an hour and not really have missed anything by the time you come back . Skip this sucker and keep your money out of Oliver Stone 's pocket .	-1
I bought this movie for my partner , it is his favorite movie and the original was gnarled by the VCR . I watched a fraction of the movie and found what I saw extremely distasteful . If you find violence towards children and the mentally challenged offensive I recommend that you avoid this movie .	-1
Rather than being about the Vietnam war as it really was , this film is basically an exercise in what America wants the vietnam war to be . Despite endless comments to the contrary , there is nothing `` realistic '' about the film . The characters and plot are almost cartoonish . Its like a postmodernist John Wayne movie with different politics.In real life , things do n't break down into `` good '' soldiers and `` evil '' soldiers . Real life and real people are about shades of grey . The war also changed over time . Oliver Stone served in 1967 but the movie is often showing situations that were more out of 1971 with which he had no personal experience.What a real film about vietnam would show is ordinary people doing a tough job day after day and doing the best they could . Its not about archtype evil officers , good/evil `` father '' figures and long political monologues.About the only thing this film got right were the uniforms .	-1
The single star is not for the entertainment value of the movie , which is excellent . The one star is for the functionality of the blu ray disc itself . I have a 32 '' Hitachi L32BD304 LCD HDTV Blu Ray 32 '' combo . I began watching Platoon in Blu Ray and eventually pressed the STOP button on the remote just after the ambush scene , thinking I would get back to the movie later.When I returned to continue watching the movie , I pressed the PLAY button and got the usual 'pause ' as the Blu Ray player 'reves up ' . Suddenly on the screen appeared `` Resume Playback ? '' with a `` YES '' and a `` No '' . I pressed OK to indicate YES , and received the `` Prohibited '' symbol . I pressed PLAY and got the same Prohibited symbol.I tried the right arrow button to choose 'NO ' , to at least see if that worked . Nothing . It asks me if I want to resume playback , but does n't respond to any remote commands from any remote control button . It 's frozen , in other words . Then , the screen suddenly cycled back to the Blu Ray presentation screen that appears when you insert a blu ray disk , and then again , back to the 'Resume Playback ' . To eject the Platoon Blu Ray disk , I had to unplug my TV power cable.After some quick reading , it appears that many Blu Ray disks have java programming that does not allow resuming a disk to start where it left off when the STOP button is pressed . The movie will start from the beginning.But that is not even the case here . I was n't even afforded that opportunity . Knowing that the issue is with the disk , I exchanged the Platoon Blu Ray disk for another , but the `` Resume Playback ? '' reappears and does n't go any further , except to re-cycle screens and return to the same `` Resume Playback ? '' . This basically makes the Platoon Blu Ray disk unplayable and USELESS on my TV . Not what I had in mind . I would have to call this a defect in the disk , as my other Blu Ray disks stop and start just fine . If the disk were to restart at the beginning , that would at least be preferable to what I have , which is a disk that wo n't allow me to even watch the movie . If anyone has had a similar experience , or has a magic pill for this nonsense , please chime in . The floor is yours Senator !	-1
Oliver Stone 's was a veteran of Vietnam himself and he appears late in this movie , which is unfortunate for his own sake , because if I were him , I 'd want to be hiding from this movie , pretending to have nothing to do with it . The three main soldiers ( Willem Dafoe , Charlie Sheen , Tom Berenger ) hate each other from the very beginning and everyone knows before it begins that it is about the loss of innocence because war is hell , so the things that happen to the three of them are pretty predictable . In some of his better work , mainly The Doors and Natural Born Killers , Oliver Stone uses a lot of effort to show the effect that the plot is having on the rest of the world . In The Doors , we see footage of Vietnam because it was transpiring at the same time . Likewise for Nixon . However , in this movie , we just see the war itself without seeing the outside world reacting to it as it unfolds . Oliver Stone does better work in the 90 's .	-1
The film opens on a dusty desert . A dude from the East arrives in town . Jim McKay meets Pat Terrill , his bride to be . Pat refuses Steve Leach 's offer to ride with them . [ Headstrong ? ] The Hennessey 's are out there , they harass McKay as a `` welcome '' . We learn about the rivalry between these two ranching outfits . Major Terrill sets out on a punitive expedition against the Hennesseys ( the smaller outfit ) ; their water tank is drilled to spill their scarce water . Terrill 's outfit rides into town to find and punish the Hennessey boys . The townsmen do nothing , they are terrorized by the Terrill gang.There is a party in the big Terrill house . [ Its interior looks like it belongs in the state capital , not a dusty rural town . ] Mr. Rufus Hennessey shows up to warn Major Terrill against any more attacks . Major Terrill does not accept the challenge [ in public ] . Rufus has a problem with his son Buck , but is Buck smarter after all ? If Buck can marry Julie Maragon then the Big Muddy ranch and its water supply will give the Hennessey 's the power in the valley . Jim McKay goes for a ride in the country ; he has a compass and a map to navigate . Steve Leach is interested in Pat Terrill , but she has made her choice . McKay visits the Maragon ranch , and cleverly convinces the heiress to sell it to him . This will make his a power in the county . Back at the ranch he visits Leach to settle their differences . [ This is all done with long camera shots that hide their stunt doubles . ] The crisis comes when Terrill 's men attack the Hennessey 's herd of cattle to keep them away from the water at the Maragon ranch . This means a range war , shooting begins when talking fails . [ War is the continuation of diplomacy . ] The Hennessey 's are outnumbered and retreat . McKay and Pat break up over a misunderstanding . [ There are other psychological conflicts in this drama . ] Rufus has a plan to get the Big Muddy ranch , but it fails . Then he goes to his back-up plan - a final showdown with Major Terrill and his outfit . [ Could those experienced riders have missed seeing the trap ? ] This story has a surprise at the end . Did you find it believable ? The needlessly ambiguous ending may not have been successful with the public . This film is also too slow-paced for me , it takes up time . This story recalls the many wars of big ranchers against small ranchers in the late 19th century . Like wars in general , it is a fight over property , to get it or to keep it . Will the good guys win ? Which side is that ?	-1
This movie gets boring and runs out of steam at about 70 minutes . The comedy seemed somewhat forced from the actors . They should have made the movie all action and no comedy with rifles being transported instead of alcohol . The genres seemed mismatched . The story could have been told in 70 to 80 minutes not 165 minutes .	-1
A great cast was wasted in this non-funny `` comedy '' /Western . Way too long , with too many characters that had nothing to do but look stupid . Burt Lancaster tries , as does Donald Pleasence , but the rest of the cast just looks lost . The script is simply chaotic and everyone 's timing seems off .	-1
This may be the first time you hear me say this , but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment . I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed . This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very `` hush-hush '' back in the early 90s . Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today ( well , as much as we recognize them today ) . This makes for a very provocative film , but it also makes for a very dated film . This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship . I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women , but somehow it just felt very dated and clich & eacute ; for me . It did n't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians , but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.The black and white photography , while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship , just felt like an art film . This was an art film , so what am I griping about ? I guess I just did n't want to see an art film with this topic . I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary , not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder . I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face , not build upon dated/old clich & eacute ; s that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard . It was unimpressive . It was n't bold filmmaking , but instead just this random , average production about a lesbian love story . Was it to be educational ? I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line . The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind . This probably sounded great on paper , but when it was actually filmed out , it seemed high schoolish and bland . The inner voices were not struggling with the character , but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved . Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party . There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle , issues , and current problems ( that would help with the dated feel ) instead of just sex , sex , and more sex.That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex . There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening . This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight . I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway . From the beginning of the first scene until the last ( and all those snippets in-between ) all they could talk about was sex . They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day . It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant . There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run . This was n't a film about women 's rights , but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships . I agree that this happened , but just not very coherently . There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film . Do n't get me wrong , this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting , but instead it went too far to the left ( which is n't bad , except in this case ) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative , here are the facts route . The black and white photography , the lack of character development ( who really was Ely 's partner ? ) , and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive `` honey pot '' . It just was n't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.Overall , I was not impressed . There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive `` raw '' sensation by trying to shock the audiences . One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society . If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style , I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth . Instead , I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game `` Go Fish '' . Ha ha ha h ... .it just is n't working for me . I do not recommend this film in the least bit . There was one , singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I can not remember why . It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema . Skip it.Grade : * out of *****	-1
This attempt at an adaption of Strindberg 's play is another ambitious failure for Mike Figgis . It 's biggest flaw is that , while focusing on the class issues between the characters ( a product of the social structure of past centuries ) , the film never convinces the audience that these are anything but 21st people . Given that flaw , all the other elements of this film are just bleak and silly .	-1
Wife did not ( I would have not watched either ) want to watch this since there were animals being slaughtered at the beginning of the movie ... hence , she opted out.I would have done likewise .	-1
I purchased this movie because it was from the presitigious Criterion Collection and based on all of the postiive reviews in here . In general I am a fan of slower paced , character driven movies that make you think/feel . Happy ending or sad ending ? No matter . Just tell your story well and I will be a satisfied viewer.I know I am in the vast minority in my opinion of this movie , but for me Wings of Desire was a great concept that was absolutely decimated in the execution of the tale . The continous return to the angels hovering over their `` clients '' was completely unnecessary and ground the story to a halt.After the first fifteen minutes when the two angels were talking together in the car , I sat up and said to myself , `` Wow , what a great set up . Now let 's see where they take the story '' . Only to be thrusted right back into the same mechanism . People babbling on about their troubles with the angels whispering over their shoulders.I immediately found myself saying , `` Wait . I 've already just experienced that for the first ten minutes of the movie . Why are we returning to this vehicle again '' ? Ten more minutes go by . Another brief exchange to move the story forward . And then back we go again . ANOTHER ten/fifteen minutes of the device . I found this to be utterly meaningless . It became the equivalent of sitting through 400 confessionals at a church , while none of them have anything to do with the story.I do n't want to reveal the plot so I will speak cryptically for those who have already seen the movie . Regarding what little plot the movie does expound upon with the trapeze artist , the conversation at the bar at the end was off-the-charts unrewarding . I stuck around for the end to see what the payoff would be , and I was so unfulfilled.I give this movie two stars because the premise was extremely interesting and the execution was certainly not aimed at the Hollywood schmaltz loving audience of yesterday/today . But just because a movie is avant-garde , it does n't make it good . And in this case , I would highly recommend you rent Wings of Desire before purchasing it.UPDATE : 12/2011 - With movies like this I usually like to go back a second time and rewatch them to see if I just missed the point/vibe/feel etc.. I just finished rewatching this again and my first impression stands even stronger . I actually listened to a bit of the director 's commentary this time , and while most of the screenplay was written by the director , a few key scenes , including the end of the movie with the trapeze artist were actually written by someone else . This does n't suprise me one bit . It 's a completely circular exposition that fails to bring home one ounce of the emotive quality that meeting/scene begged for in concept . I suppose for `` art 's sake '' , this may be rewarding to some . But for me , it was yet another massively missed opportunity in a movie littered with them.I REALLY wanted to like this movie.I see most people here do n't agree with my review and consider this movie a masterpiece . I take no exception to that at all . Art obviously speaks to us all in different ways . As I mentioned before , in general I love slow character driven movies . But this one is simply not for me .	-1
I learned long ago to ignore and laugh at the positive and negative feedback that a reviewer gets . Obviously my one star review of this movie will get negative feedback but that does n't make my opinion any less valid . It is , after all , my honest opinion , and therefore it is worth something to someone , if only to me . Sometimes I agree with Ebert , and sometimes i completely disagree with him . I think we all believe in our hearts that `` I '' am the only one with the correct opinion . I would subscribe to that myself.This movie is PAINFULLY slow and boring . Wim Wenders , next time maybe you will develop a story line , please , huh ? I really hate the premise that the only way an angel 's life can be fulfilling is if he becomes human . That is the moral here and also in the annoying movie City of Angels . That 's absurd . Assuming that there is life after death , assuming that there are angels , and I in no way discount that possibility because I know how little we truly know , it is absurd to think that the angels have nothing to do but watch over us and wish they were with us . That is offensively stupid and self centered . It is like a child 's point of view that mommy and daddy have absolutely nothing to do and are bored to tears when they are not watching the baby and coloring in the baby 's coloring book.So this conception of angels is , in my not at all humble opinion , stupid and offensive . What makes you think that we humans are the center of the universe and the only worthwhile thing that is going on , dingbat ? Stupid premise , and boring story , if you want to call it a story at all . I ca n't keep watching it . It is still on right now , and I 'm writing this review to relieve the boredom.Later - After seeing the end of the movie , I must add that the final monologue committed by the angel 's human girlfriend is probably the worst monologue I have ever seen on film . She goes on and on , saying nothing , in a stupid and self indulgent elongated bit of nonsense that is surreal , meaningless , and stupid.The only thing that this movie has going for it is that it makes people appreciate simple things about life , like warming your hands together on a cold day . That 's a nice and worthwhile thought , to appreciate the very little and insignificant things about life . Aside from that bit of wisdom , this movie is poor , boring , full of itself , aimless , and overrated .	-1
This is one of those boring Sci-Fi 's . Do n't think I would watch it again , nor would I recommend it to others ... even on a boring afternoon or evening .	-1
Witchfinder General is about witch hunting , a period of history that was really graphic . Vincent Price plays Mathew Hopkins wichfinder and witchhunter . Price was great as the sinister Hopkins but there was an air of disturbance about the film . Mathew Hopkins gets word that a priest in a village in England is a witch . So Hopkins goes to the residence of the priest and subjects him to some pretty graphic torture . ( Sticking him with sharp objects for instance ) His neice whom he is raising finds out about her uncle and tries to save him by seducing Hopkins . The woman Sarah is in love with a soldier in Cromwell 's Army named Richard . There is a Civil War going on in England between Cromwell 's Army and King Charles ' Royalist forces . The priest is safe in a cell as long as Sarah indulges Hopkins but when she is raped by Hopkin 's partner the priest is let out of his cell and subjected to torture . Not wanting Sarah anymore Hopkins starts his torture tactics on the priest and others by dunking them in water while being tied to rope . If they float they are innocent and if they swim they are guilty . The innocent people are found guilty and burned at the stake . Richard finds all of this out and vows revenge against Hopkins for the defilement of his beloved . The town has paid Hopkins a great deal of money to find and burn witches . He is called & # 34 ; Witchfinder General & # 34 ; . The film shows a woman being burned at the stake . There is slapping of faces and torture that is graphic for a 1968 movie . Hopkins vows to trap Richard , so to bring the soldier to him , he kidnaps Sarah . He finally arrests Richard and Sarah is subjected to torture . Now everyone played their parts well . It was a good story line and was well directed by Michael Reeves BUT the content of the film was a little to graphic for my taste . ( Vincent Price did not like the turn his films were taking . He did not like Witchfinder General or Scream . He thought they were to sinister and bloody ) However if you are a Vincent Price fan and the historical aspect does n't bother you this may be a good movie for you but it was n't for me .	-1
I 've seen several reviews of this movie claiming that `` Conqueror Worm '' ( a title this movie is also known as ) is Vincent Price 's greatest performance . I can only imagine that these people 's knowledge of Vinny P. is limited to this movie , because anyone who has actually watched an excellent Price movie like `` House on Haunted Hill '' or `` Last Man On Earth '' would view this slice of British 60 's schlock as just what it is : an awful film . Boring , preachy and utterly predictable , `` Witchfinder General '' also mixes in a healthy dose of nihilism and hopelessness just to make everything that much harder to take . I would not buy this movie and I would n't recommend that anyone should watch it . Although a friend of mine , who likes to go on and on about how evil the Catholic Church is , actually claims to like this movie . So , if you fall into that category , this movie may be up your alley .	-1
I spent a good portion of my teen years in Riverdale ( Bronx ) near JFK High in the late 70s and early 80s when the hiphop culture was starting and the music was referred to as `` freaking out music '' ( after a then-popular dance ) . Wild Style , Charlie Ahearn 's early hip hop flick , pretty much got it right . Then came this hollywood ripoff about 2 years later.The story is a melodramatic version of the tale told in Wild Style . The idea of this silly fool ( `` Ramo '' ) , a damn grown man who would rather paint trains than get a job to feed his girlfriend and baby-who would sympathize with such a moron ? Compare this to Lee Quiniones ' more authentic prototype in Wild Style . The music consists of the soulless , ultra-computerized , synthesized trash that led to the dark ages of black music of the 1980s ( at least the lyrics had not yet reached the negative lows of the gangster garbage to come ) . Rap was actually on it 's way out at the time just before this movie was filmed in the winter of 1983 ( it was released that following summer ) , before Run DMC revived the genre with their much needed shot in the arm . This film shows why it was so bad before their arrival.The acting is atrocious ! Guy Davis supposedly angry speech to Rae Dawn Chong 's dance class about exploiting the hip hop culture is so contrived and poorly acted that it causes laughter instead of tension . No wonder he was never heard from in films after this ! The only thing worth seeing here are the break battles early in the film ( although breakdancing generally gets tiring to watch after a period of time ) . The party in the abandoned building with bootleg electricity early in the film ( with the beloved Sharah `` Sha-Rock '' Greene of the Funky 4+1 More among others taking a turn at the mike ) DOES capture the flavor and spirit of the era well.The Treacherous Three ( with young Kool Moe Dee and Dougie Fresh ) are quite amusing in their politically incorrect rap skit about Santa Claus on welfare ( `` My GI Joe turned out GI gay ! `` ) , we get breif glipmses of the legendary hiphop inventor Kool DJ Herc in what amounts to a cameo , as well as a performance or two from Afrika Bambaata 's Soul Sonic Force . Melle Mel is in rare form during his pwerful performance of `` Beat Street breakdown . '' These factors raise the movie for me from 1 to 2 stars.If they isolated the appearances and performances of the true rap pioneers on this DVD without the dumb story and bad acting , then it would be worthwhile .	-1
After watching the abysmal `` Excellent Adventure '' I took another kick in the nads and watched this complete waste of time . If you think the first film is bad , then do n't even think about this one . Once again our two uncharismatic do-do birds go on another `` trip '' ! Whoopee ! : -D I do want to point out that I like stupid stoner films and I can watch the dumbest of dumb when it come to them , but this film is boring , stupid and should have nothing of interest for anyone . There are so many better stoner comedies out there ! Lets just forget this one ever happened !	-1
John Carpenter has made a name for himself by delivering tacky cult classics over the decades , and this post-apocalyptic bore-fest is one of them . Yes , I called this boring and yes I gave this two stars so you can start the complaining and & # 8216 ; non-helpful & # 8217 ; voting now , but really & # 8230 ; are you serious with this ? Yes , the film is brisk , but it is ridiculously dated and makes zero impact . Kurt Russell & # 8217 ; s performance barely translates across the screen , and while the idea of Manhattan being a prisoner & # 8217 ; s wasteland is pretty cool , the construction of that world is pretty lazy and the cast of characters couldn & # 8217 ; t be less engaging . Borgnine is a joke here and Donald Pleasence is wasted . The final frames hold some intensity , but it is too little too late , with a & # 8216 ; moral & # 8217 ; ending that feels tacked on and irrelevant . Maybe if I saw this in 1981 I & # 8217 ; d have a different feeling , but through 2013 eyes this is a dumb movie .	-1
Really goofy premise for a movie . Pretty much goes along without any surprises . Seem to drag in a few spots .	-1
not a well made BD . Transfer is horrible . Plus the bonus section was not working on my PS3 . Weird . Anyway , I will be waiting for an updated BD coming this fall .	-1
I was bored last Sunday afternoon and watched this movie ( free with Prime ) . The whole premise is unbelievable ( they made the city of New York a prison . The most valuable real estate on the planet . ) We 've seen Kurt Russel a zillion time in a role like this - tough guy , does n't play by the rules , blah , blah , blah . And when the presidents plane goes down in New York , a police commissioner decides that Kurt is the ONLY guy that can get the president out . Kurt makes friends with a group of prisoners that he ran into and what do you know ? - They got him out - Well , I thin they got him out , I actually started vacuuming with the movie playing in the background . It 's a real yawn if you ask me .	-1
Just some thing to watch to kill time . I rated this class D movie two stars , and that is over kill ...	-1
Umm ... I 've had Robocop on BluRay for over a year now ... matter of fact it was a set with all three films ... Why do I want to buy it again ?	-1
I wonder if Amazon is going to post my review.Why does n't a Blu-Ray have any Special Features ? Wtf is wrong with these people ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I will Not buy any Blu-Ray or HD DVD that does Not have any extras ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The only reasons we , Sid the Elf , gave this non-B stinkfest 2 stars was due to some cool explosions . Sid intended to do two things tonight , laugh and watch a great unintentional comedy . Well , Sid always has a good time , but there was not a passable unintentional comedy in sight.Robocop is based on an effemine Chris Hansen looking cop , who gets blasted , then transformed into a cyborg cop . So , eventually , he goes after the guys who killed him and turned into a metal man . In the business they call that a revenge story . Well , here 's the revenge Robocop exacted until the last 15 minutes of the movie : he arrested the bad men . Wow , enthraling ! Really , Sid was riveted . Then , they had to make this movie even girlier by making Robocop fall in love with his butch partner , who looked like Sid 's sophomore year biology teacher . For those of you who did not graduate from North Pole High , that 's not good.So , if your woman is looking for a chick flick with a little action , rent Robocop and put it on in one room . Then pop in your copy of Predator or Total Recall for yourself in another .	-1
This Movie sucked the acting was poor and the jet pack well look at it like this why would a cop need a jet pack a kid of about 6 would think something like that is cool and his new gun was okay but I love the little automatic pistol he used it looked and sounded cool but of course since I liked it that ninga had to cut in half with a super sharp sword take some advise that is good and watch the first one .	-1
Come on ! Rated PG-13 ! ? This is why the movie was stupid ! They made Robocop act funny and dumb . What happened to Peter Weller the orginal Robocop ! ? The story in this movie is lame but the only credit I give this movie is the fact that Robo has the new weapon which connects to his hand and the flight pack .	-1
Although this has a better story than Robocop 2 , there still is n't anything special about it . Totally forgettable . Appealing only to 6yr . olds who have real low attention spans . It also lacked violence , the key ingredient from the first two .	-1
Chuck has done better acting in his infomercials . This silly film makes Rambo II seem like poetry . But I must confess I paid ticket prices to see Chuck back in the 1980s . `` Lone Wolf McQuade '' is at least a little funny , and has Barbara Carrera , and a loopy David Carradine going for it . Avoid Missing In Action . Excessive drinking is a far more fun way to destroy brain cells .	-1
I can not review this product , because I can not watch it . It was not for my region . Very angry . This is not the first time this has happened to me . Guess I will have to buy my movies else where	-1
`` Bananas '' has to be the worst Woodman comedy ever made . Even as a major fan of Woody Allen , I have to admit it was a waste of time to sit through the one and a half hour of trying material . The usual ingredients that make his movies tick - clever dialogue , self-mockery , good rapport between leading cast et al - were clearly lacking . This is definitely one Allen movie I will not re-watch and one DVD I will not be keeping .	-1
Not sure how to deal with this . The sound quality is awful and leads me to believe this is pirated .	-1
I bought this DVD because of the genuinely funny picture of Allen in his Castro outfit on the cover . Believe me , that 's the biggest laugh you 're gon na get from this clunker . It appears to have been shot on Super-8 by a rank amateur and the waaaay dated humor ( sorry , Howard Cosell is NOT funny ) falls as flat as a set of Firestone tires . If this is funny , then I 'm Groucho Marx . Not just bad , but incredibly bad . I was embarrassed to watch it -- and I was alone ! This one begged for a one-way ticket to the nearest landfill . I was happy to oblige .	-1
Love Woody , but this film is not one of his best , or even close . Depending on how close to the surface your funny bone is , this is one of those movies in which you might occasionally say & quot ; that was clever & quot ; or & quot ; that was witty & quot ; , but you 'll rarely laugh out loud . The only time I laughed out loud was during one skit when Woody introduces himself as & quot ; Victor ... Victor Shakapopolis & quot ; . Other than that , the entire movie was pretty much laughless . The last segment , for example , is a classic and is the best one , and certainly deserved to be included , yet I ca n't imagine too many people rolling on the floor - it 's simply not funny , just very clever . Not to say that 's a bad thing , but we know Woody can make us laugh and he just does n't do it in this film . The sheep sketch with Gene Wilder and the & quot ; What 's My Perversion & quot ; sketch are in pretty bad taste , which might be ok if they were funny at all , but they 're not . Too bad . It 's one of the Woodman 's few misfires . I can only recommend the DVD version if you have a few bucks to spare someday and are desperate for something to watch . The best thing about the film was some fantastic guitar/organ jazz played during a few skits . And the musicians/songs were n't even identified in the credits !	-1
I got the screenplay from the library and read it several times before I watched the film . The screenplay was chock full of intriguing characters and conflicts . I could n't wait to see the film . And then I saw the film . I could barely get through half an hour of it without wanting to hurl . It was all in the film 's style . A talentless , first year film school student bending over backward to imitate Bergman ( Ingmar , the Swedish writer-director ) and falling flat on his face . It comes off like some sort of over-the-top satire and parody of Bergman 's style.Years later , looking back , Allen has said that , if he had the chance to do it over , he could do it much better . He said that he 'd make it `` less poetic . '' Less poetic . That 's about as close as he will get to admitting that attempting to imitate Bergman 's style was a humiliating mistake.In my view , this is the one and only time Allen has made an ( almost ) unwatchable film .	-1
I like Woody Allen movies but I could n't get into this one . It just did n't get my attention so I never finished it .	-1
I thought that this was a movie with more of Meryl Streep in it than she was , I do not particularly like Woody Allen , but I will watch it again , it is not one of my most favorite movies , like I said , it seems like Meryl only had a few cameo 's in this film , if I were to purchase this film again , I would not have bought it ... sorry : ( ... .

Woody Allen stars as someone who has been preserved for 200+ years after a botched hospital stay , then revived in a new environment . That new environment is supposed to represent some humorous vision of where we might be headed in the future . Except it 's just boring - all the way through . Bottom-Line : I 'll NEVER watch a Woody Allen movie again .	-1
I watched this movie and then placed it in the trash . what a waste of time and sooooo slow . this is one woody movie i just did not like . would have been better with some murder scenes added .	-1
Seriously . Clive Barker should n't have let this money making franchise get out of hand . It was n't as bad as the third one ... .but it was prob as bad as Hellraiser 2 .	-1
The Bottom Line : A really pretty terrible movie that is inexplicably beloved , The Fog sandwiches one or two effective scenes between reams of plot exposition and corny acting ; only the `` so bad it 's good '' effect saves the movie from an even lower grade .	-1
I was always led to believe that The Howling was one of the great werewolf movies , up to par with the classic American Werewolf In London . So I had high expectations for this one when I finally sat down and decided to watch it . What I got was exactly the opposite : one of the worst werewolf movies I 've seen . I mean there 's some pretty bad ones out there , but this one almost takes the cake.What really made this film almost unwatchable was its complete and utter lack of pacing . This has to be the slowest moving werewolf movie of all time , and probably one the most boring horror films I 've had to suffer through . There is n't any real werewolf action in this movie until about 60 minutes into it , and it 's a 90 minute feature ! Another thing I did n't like was it 's annoying ill-placed soundtrack . There 's lots of old 1950 Phantom of the Opera haunted castle organ music that does not accompany the film very well at all . Apart from all that , the characters were completely uninteresting and the acting had a watching quality that is the equivalent to the appeal of eating cardboard.And another thing people always talk about is the werewolf transformations in The Howling , but I did n't think they were especially that great . I actually found the transformations slow and slightly stupid looking . The transformations in An American Werewolf in London were greatly superior . I actually thought the transformations in `` London '' were probably the best that anyone could possibly do using more conventional special effects and it really makes me wish special effects teams today still used more conventional effects like they did back in the day , because they were way more appealing than the highly contrived CGI effects of today , but this is hardly the case in The Howling.In closing , I would have the say The Howling was one of the great movie disappointments of my movie-going life . People who really like this film must either : A . Have n't seen too many movies or B . Like any movie with a werewolf in it and substance heeds no concern .	-1
Let 's face facts : When he made `` The Last House on the Left , '' Wes Craven was an unskilled wannabe , and it shows . `` Last House '' is a clumsily made mess that does not deserve the absurd accolades that it has received over the years . For an example of skillfully made classic exploitation cinema , check out Craven 's followup , `` The Hills Have Eyes , '' which shows that he was capable of learning from his mistakes . And please do n't pay attention to Craven or the dimwitted `` film scholars '' ( Robin Wood , e.g . ) who claim that `` Last House '' is a powerful statement about the Vietnam era ( or somesuch nonsense ) , because it is n't : it 's an inept attempt to create a `` calling-card '' trashfest , not a piece of profound social commentary . It does n't work on either level .	-1
All these grand reviews , are you kidding ? , this is junk ! , stupid premise , really stupid dialog , and the characters are paper thin , the cops , there are no cops this stupid anywhere , run out of gas ? , none in the trunk ? , did they leave the police radio on the checker board ? please ! I could n't figure if this was a comedy or , choke , serious ? , we really got a lot of laughs from it ! It was plain to see it was shoot on a shoestring and his efforts did get better in later films , but , this was awful !	-1
Viewed : 10/07Rate : 310/07 : Since I 've been seeing some crappy horror films of today , the premise behind The Last House on the Left is very familiar . Wes Craven basically throws in sadism heavily handed to defile two young women in order to create a horror picture . Instead , the message behind The Last House on the Left is that raping women is fun . All I saw in the picture was glorification . I failed to see the horror aspect in The Last House on the Left but rather be insulted with the kind of thinking that Wes Craven presents . Judging on the production of The Last House on the Left , I thought the picture looked good but too off-beat . I could n't get away from the fact how hammy the dialogue was , but to give credit , it was a lot better than The Hills Have Eyes . As for the characters , I thought all did a somewhat good job and did what they could do to make an effective picture , but they were one-dimensional at best . But , the idea behind The Last House on the Left did n't constitute a horror picture in my view . I mean , the film I saw before The Last House on the Left was Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer . For comparative purposes , Wes Craven comes away looking like a misguided wannabe . By his banner on The Last House on the Left 's poster , it says `` It 's only a movie ... blah ... blah '' . Conveying that message was to dissuade the viewers from thinking that it was too frightening to think the movie was real . To be honest with you , I found the movie terribly boring to watch , let alone the terrifying feel ( which was nil ) . Taken from wiki , it states , `` The film split opinion with critics , unsure whether the film is a bold artistic statement or exploitative trash , or some combination of the two . Audiences , however , flocked to see the film and , along with films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , it is credited with bringing a new sense of realistic violence to the modern horror film genre . '' Ahh , interesting ... does that mean somebody behind The Last House on the Left actually committed the similar crimes and/or perhaps had a first-hand experience of it ? Why is it so important to create a film like The Last House on the Left and leave the victims , especially raped females , feeling lastingly awful ? Some say that the rape scene in The Last House on the Left was the worst put in a film ; well , that 's not true . As a matter of fact , there 's hardly any vision of rape in it . Death Wish 3 blows the doors off of The Last House on the Left when it comes to rape . Some say that The Last House on the Left is a masterpiece . Yeah , of course , they probably are too sick to realize that they are too far removed from society to discern between right and wrong . Wes Craven is one of them . Gee whiz , how did this man manage to make films again and again ? The only impressive film in his resume is Scream while nearly everything else he did was trivially boring and amateurish , failing to meet the idea of what a `` horror film '' is . Anyone in the world can make The Last House on the Left . All they have to do is get a couple of girls who will be willingly to cooperate with the rape scenes and earn the money . What saved me in The Last House on the Left is my suspicion of the young cop until I was reaffirmed in the ending credits that it was actually Martin Kove . Dang , he looked boyishly young . The title The Last House on the Left had me thinking : `` Why is it called that way ? '' Surely , if you were going this way , it would be like ... .the first house on the right . Ahh ... Wes Craven , The Last House on the Left has safely vaunted you in my Worst Directors list . You just ca n't direct , period .	-1
Wes Craven 's uber-low-budget freshman cinematic outing `` Last House on the Left '' leaves me as puzzled as his second , ever so-slightly more effective take on brutality `` The Hills Have Eyes '' , chiefly because I just do n't understand why these two laughably awful clunkers are considered so influential to modern horror movies.That said , it 's useful to compare `` Last House '' with `` Hills '' , since both films have a lot in common : 1 ) Both are astonishly low-budget -- -this is movie-making on the cheap , folks , not so much Low Budget as `` We made this film for the price of a subway token and a Big Mac '' filmmaking ; 2 ) Both feature what are supposed to be horrific and harrowing collisions between All-American Innocence and evil , subhuman savages ; 3 ) Both of these early Craven outtings really , really try to be shocking ; 4 ) Both movies are abysmal and deliver absolutely zero scares . Just as there are a few celebrities floating around who are famous for being famous , `` Last House '' and `` Hills '' are movies that are shocking for the sake of being shocking.Sadly , `` Last House on the Left '' is n't that shocking at all . It 's crudely made , most of the acting is atrocious ( particularly the avenging parents and the bumptious police ) , and scenes of true horror are constantly undercut by comedic sequences which serve absolutely no purpose other than to ruin the film 's atmosphere of unease . Why have a pair of Laurel & Hardy-esque style sheriffs in what is supposedly a film of uncompromising savagery ? And why , Wes Craven , tell me why would you include the toe-tapping musical number `` Sadie and Krug '' , meant to be a ballad to the film 's two psychos and set to the accompaniment of kazoos ? Yes , the film features a musical number with kazoos . `` It 's only a Movie '' ? Let 's hope so . With that in mind : THE BASICS : Two wholesome , all-American girls go on a fun-filled trip to the Big Apple to score pot and attend a `` Bloodlust '' concert . They are picked up by a motley crew of criminals led by a ravening psycopath named `` Krug '' ( shades of Freddy Krueger , anyone ? ) and get more bloodlust than they bargained for . Their killers subsequently seek refuge for the night in the home of the parents of one of their victims.THE GOOD : David Hess , who plays the surly , snarling , cold-blooded killer Krug , is actually creepily charismatic and does a good job as a Manson-esque psycho . Hess also penned the haunting ditty `` The Road goes on to Nowhere '' and the rest of the film 's soundtrack , though if he 's responsible for the kazoo number he should do hard time.The three other psychos that make up Krug 's merry men are also competent . Jeramie Rain does an itchingly nasty job as Krug 's gun moll Sadie , serving up a convincing performance that is a little too chillingly close to Charles Manson 's adoring female 'Family ' members . Marc Sheffler plays Krug 's slightly less repulsive younger brother Junior , and manages to convey his wormish , torn character 's drug dependency and weakness.Fred Lincoln also does a nice turn as Fred `` Weasel '' Podowski , who 's just there for the ride but is as happy as Krug when the claret begins to flow . Incidentally , Mr. Lincoln evidently found his metier later in the Porn industry , starring in such family fare as `` Devil in Miss Jones Part II '' and directing charmers like `` Heidi Does Hollywood '' and `` Anal Intruder 10 '' ( I 'm not kidding : check out Lincoln 's bio on IMDB if you do n't believe me ) .Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham are , I think , quite convincing as the two teenage girls in peril , and the scenes of their rape , torture , and subsequent murder at the hands of Krug 's thugs are unpleasant and shot with an unflinching camera . Doubtless this would be rough , grueling stuff , if not for ... .THE BAD : The young Wes Craven really , really wanted to shock his audience , but unfortunately there 's no suspense here , no shock , no horror , nothing remotely scary . You have a lot of sloppy editing , and the sequence in which Cassel and Grantham are tortured and murdered , though harrowing , is undercut by the brutish , forced comic scenes with the blundering deputies.And what 's with the ornate American Gothic house featured in the creepy cover art ? Nothing remotely like that appears in the film ; what you get here is a typical 1970 's ranch house that appears to have been decorated , from a K-Mart , a few minutes before shooting started.THE UGLY : Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr as the avenging parents are unremittingly awful and completely ruin whatever tension and suspense the movie might have delivered . And Marshall Anker and Martin Cove as the blundering policemen are mind-blastingly horrible . There 's a sequence where the Sheriff and his deputy , their car having broken down , try to get a ride in a chicken truck . Why were these scenes included at all ? Finally , you also get a kazoo sing-along , which in its own fashion is pretty terrifying , though not in the way Craven intended.THE VERDICT : Abominably bad , not shocking , and somewhat repulsive . If you want to be shocked , you 'll find more shocking stuff in 30 seconds of `` Texas Chainsaw Massacre '' than you will in this atrociously bad film ; come to think of it , you 'll find more terror in 5 minutes of any of the `` Friday the 13th '' movies than you will in all of `` Last House . `` If you 're a Wes Craven completist or have a few hours to waste on a morbid curiosity , then you may want to check it out . Otherwise , you 'll not have missed anything if you avoid this monstrosity .	-1
You talk about disappointed , this is the icing on the cake . All I hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was . Not even close . Whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong . I love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such . There are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the 70 's , but this is not one of them . Seriously , do n't buy this . I do n't know why it is so highly regarded . The acting , story , and especially the music is terrible . It 's like porn quality acting , a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a Disney movie . It could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy , threw in some disturbing music , and made the bad guys , well , more bad . It could be remade ( which I 'm usually against ) .	-1
Okay , this is an incredibly cheesy , low-budget film which does n't have very many redeeming qualities besides the fact that it has a very Helter Skelter feel to it . As I was watching it , it occurred to me that Craven , consciously or unconsciously , was writing a documentary heavily inspired by the Manson family and murders . The callousness and frenzied acts of ruthless murder strike me as probably being very similar to the way the Manson murders went down . BUT the problems with this film are MANY . The base gore and violence , the lousy character development , the very obvious GOOD v. EVIL theme and the cheap attempts to `` shock '' the audience take so much away from its integrity for it ever to be considered a great horror film . The writers/directors seem to have not been able to decide what kind of movie they wanted to make : a horror film , a spoof of a horror film , a snuff film , a slapstick comedy or a porno . Since they could n't decide which way they were going , they just threw all of those elements in , in an extremely haphazard way . Tactics such as graphic rape , forced urination , disembowling , oral removal of sexual organs etc. , are so forced , it is just so obvious that the directors were simply intending to push the barriers of film making and say `` @ # $ % the rules '' . Throwing conventionality to the wind is a great thing for film makers but at the same time , the director/writers seem to be enjoying this agony a little too much to believe they were simply showing the reality of modern violence without glorifying it quite a bit . Be prepared to shower after you watch this film and do n't expect to be able to enjoy food for a long time .	-1
OK THIS FILM IS REALLY HYPED FOR NOTHING . IF YOU WANT A REAL SCARE WATCH THE ORIGINAL TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE OR EVEN THE NEW VERSION OF IT THAT JUST CAME OUT.YES I THINK MAYBE SINCE IT WAS MADE IN THE 70 'S THAT I 'VE SEEN MUCH WORSE BUT I WAS N'T EVEN SCARED AND IT WAS ALMOST FUNNY TO SAY THE LEAST . THE BIG KILLINGS WERE SO BORING . HARDLY ANY GORE . I THINK WHAT FREAKED ME OUT MOST WAS HOW CHEESY THE 70 'S WERE AND HOW IMCOMPETENT THEY MADE THE COPS LOOK . THAT WAS A JOKE ! IF YOU WANT A REAL GOOD MOVIE CHECK OUT GOTHIKA WITH HALLE BERRY OR EVEN THE RING.AND IF YOU LIKE OLD MOVIES I SUGGEST ALL THE TEXAS CHAINSAWS ... OR EVEN THE 1ST FEW FRIDAY THE 13THS . EVEN THE HALLOWEEN SERIES WAS MORE SCAREY ! AND TO SAY THIS MOVIE WAS GORY AND SADISTIC . YEAH IT WAS CREEPY BUT ONLY FOR A SECOND . THE PARENTS THAT WENT ON THAT STRANGE KILLING SPREE I MEAN REALLY . HUGE JOKE ! I 'M SOO MAD I STAYED UP WATCHING THIS.. LET ALONE PAID MONEY FOR IT . DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME REALLY . WISH I DID N'T . AND I 'M A HUGE HORROR MOVIE FAN.. I EVEN THINK FRIDAY THE 13TH JASON X WAS A BETTER MOVIE HAHA ... I REALLY MEAN THAT !	-1
As close to snuff as any film in the seventies managed , technically inept , a pornographic rip-off of Bergman 's & quot ; Virgin Spring , & quot ; and overall , just hideous . Yes , the brutality left an impression . Is that what you are looking for ?	-1
What is the deal with everyone saying disturbing ? This was no worse than every other 70s/80s horror films . I was actually quite bored throughout this film . The most sickenly amusing scenes are in the beginning before they go in the woods . I kept expecting something utterly gruesome and terrible to happen . It never did , unless you consider rape ( which really was n't that graphic ; never shows anything ) . I frankly hae seen worse by about twenty times . I 'm not quite sure wh the controversy . Typical 70s film noire . Nothing more , nothin less .	-1
I grew up fearing this movie as I recall the day my brother was telling my mother all about this & # 34 ; Horrific & # 34 ; film . Well when the Horror Genre bug finally bit me , I started collecting all that i could get my hands on and this one on its list . It is so painfully stupid and so cheaply made I have not been able to watch it through its entirety . I have popped this movie in 3 times and all 3 times I have had to stop watching it out of pure Boredom . I was surprised i took a chance on the remake but at least with the remake I was able to watch it from beginning to end . The 1972 version should be scrapped and burned .	-1
I had heard so much about this film . `` Its so violent , its so disturbing , blah , blah , blah . '' I finally went out and rented it . What a disappointment ! The story is good enough : Two girls go the city to see a concert , try buying some pot , and end up being kidnapped by some escaped cons . The girls are eventually killed and the killers end up hiding , unknowingly , at one of the girl 's parents ' home , where the parents take their revenge . But the camera work is awful , the music is stupid , and the acting is average at best . The two bumbling cops are completely unnecessary and unfunny . I constantly see this film mentioned in the same company as `` Texas Chainsaw Massacre '' , which is an insult to TCM . Fred Lincoln , who plays one of the convicts , once said this is the only movie he made that he wished he had n't , and he went on to make `` adult '' films ! Wes Craven went on to make some good films , but this one is lame .	-1
The Phantasm film series has always been a somewhat unsettling for a few reasons ... Ffrst , Angus Scrimm as the sinister `` Tall Man '' is one of horror 's more interesting villains . He does n't need a butcher knife or an axe to be intimidating ; he 's just as effective with his menacing glare . Second , the series truly defies explanation . Does anyone really know what in the hell is going on in these films ? Director/Writer Don Coscarelli is either a genius or a lunatic . The original cast is all back including Scrimm along with A. Michael Baldwin ( Mike ) Reggie Bannister ( Reggie ) and Bill Thornbury ( Jody ) .Phantasm IV Oblivion gets a new release with bonus features courtesy of Anchor Bay . It promises to answer some of the series ' questions but ends up opening up more mysteries than it solves . The film was made on a miniscule budget of $ 650.000 , and trust me , it shows . A good one-third of the film is told in flashbacks using footage that was cut from the first Phantasm film in 1979 . I suppose that 's one way to lower the production costs but none of these flashbacks does anything to forward the plot of this film . Mainly we see Mike back as a 13 year-old , sneaking on to Reggie 's ice cream truck , going to his brother 's funeral , or cruising around with Reggie . The only flashback scene of any importance is when Jody and Mike lure the Tall Man into a noose and hang him from a tree . It does n't kill him of course , it just makes him mad and he convinces Mike to cut him down by promising to leave and never come back . Yeah ... we know how that turned out , do n't we ? This Anchor Bay releases features an uncut version of the film . It opens right where Phantasm III ended with Mike fleeing in the Tall Man 's hearse while Reggie is pinned to a wall by dozens of the silver spheres . The Tall Man , I guess showing his sporting side , just lets Reggie go , telling him it 's not his time . Of course , soon after , Reggie is accosted by a demonic traffic cop as he goes after Mike . It 's clear this scene was tossed in to give Reggie something to do and so he could deliver the snappy one-liner , `` blow me ! `` Eventually , the Hearse takes over and drives Mike out to a rocky desert area . Coscarelli has been accused of simply dressing up his evil dwarfs to look like Jawas . Perhaps as way to thumb his nose at his critics , he has the dwarfs crawling around the rocks and peeking as Mike walks around , just like the Jawas did in Star Wars . Up until this point , roughly halfway through , the film has basically consisted of Mike driving and having flashbacks , and Reggie driving after him and meeting another girl on the road who wo n't give him any action in the sack . Still , Reggie scenes are the best part of the film.This is when the wheels come off big time . Mike and the Tall Man begin dimension hopping through those weird portals . Mike sees himself during the Civil War being operated on by the Tall Man . Maybe this was to establish how old the Tall Man is but we already knew this from the first film . We then see Mike sometime in the 1800 's as the Tall Man introduces himself as Jebediah Morningside , a seemingly kindly old doctor or scientist . What happened to turn him evil ? Or is the real Jebediah Morningside dead and the Tall Man is an alien using his form ? Did he cross-over into some strange Hellish dimension ? Mike talks about using the portals to go back in time and kill him before he turns evil but then nothing becomes of the idea.What we ultimately learn , or at least confirm , is that the Tall Man ca n't be killed . Kill one body and another from a different time or dimension appears . Where 's the conflict in that ? We still do n't find out what his true intentions are , what the silver spheres are , or why he wants Mike so badly . The Phantasm films have been entertaining but this one strictly looks like a money grab by Coscarelli . What also hurts the film is that much of action takes place outdoors , rather than in gloomy and creepy mortuaries . That atmosphere was a big part of the first three films and it is missing here.Phantasm V is supposedly in production and due to come out in 2009 . Is a new sequel going to fly thirty years after the original ? Scrimm is now in his mid-80s and Reggie Bannister is 62 ! If we do indeed get a new film hopefully it will bring the series to an effective close , something Phantasm IV failed to do .	-1
Along the trajectory of David Cronenberg 's career , Scanners feels like a step backwards . While the premise is intriguing - drug companies and evil corporations wage bloody war with telepaths as cannon fodder - the execution is painfully dull and unintentionally funny . Part of the problem is the acting , which is wooden all around but reaches new depths whenever Stephen Lack opens his mouth . This guy is dreadful . He sure does Lack the ability to deliver lines . The high point of the film comes early with the infamous exploding head scene . Nothing that follows , not even the climactic psychic battle royale , comes close to the visceral potency of that scene . It 's all downhill from there . For instance , how does a telephone booth explode ? And if you were shot in the hand with a huge dart , would n't you just pull it out rather than run around a mall until it knocked you out ? If there were a few more exploding heads I might not be splitting hairs . A disappointing outing from a talented filmmaker .	-1
David Croneberg 's 1980 film about telepathic humans being recruited by government and an evil corporate defense contractor . The good telepath Cameron ( Stephen Lack ) comes upon the conspiracy and seeks to do the right thing . An evil telepath named Revok ( Michael Ironside ) seeks to carry out his evil plan and stop Cameron.Horrible film quality that has every trapping of a & quot ; B & quot ; movie . Terribly outdated and overrated . The script is dull , the story is predictable , the acting utterly mediocre , and the special effects are cheap . It 's time for this movie to find its Hollywood grave .	-1
I honestly ca n't see what all the fuss is about . For years I 've heard how Scanners was a classic piece of sci-fi , how it was David Cronenberg 's first masterpiece . But when I sat down to see it I could only see small pieces of greatness drowning in a sea of a greatly overrated film.Sure Cronenberg is a talented director , and Scanners shows his promise , but this story about people with telekinetic powers seems like it comes from a rough draft of a script without the ideas , plot and characters fully worked out . Almost as bothersome is the monotone acting by the lead , a newly recruited scanner sent to kill another attempting to take over the world . Though many have said the acting is intentional , it just came across to me that he was a very poor actor ( of course , the DVD 's badly dubbed voices could account for some of that ) . But more so , every scene seems as though it 's still a work in progress , that the screenwriter ( Cronenberg ) ran out of time before production . It does n't feel remotely closed to polished.I admit that if I had seen this in 1980 when it came out , that it may have had a bigger impact on me . But I 've seen plenty of sci-fi prior to this time that was leagues better then Scanners . I know I 'll catch some flak for my unpopular view , but it 's my honest , well thought out opinion . Of course I thought the `` exploding head '' scene was excellent in its shocking quality , the rest of the film just seemed to fall from there.Scanners was a major disappointment for me , and though I know many disagree with me , I ca n't share their enthusiasm . It 's worth checking out if only too see the exploding head , but , for me , is otherwise a forgettable film .	-1
In September ( according to davisdvd ) MGM will release Swamp Thing but only in its PG form . Why , when every other dvd release nowadays comes with an unrated version would MGM only release the PG one ? A dual release for those who want it with or without the added adult content would be more welcome for this than say the upcoming Dodgeball Unrated ( with a whole one minute of extra footage ) . If they did release both versions I BET the R or unrated one would outsell the PG . Perhaps they 're waiting for everyone to buy it in September and then a couple months later the extended version will come . Is n't that how they all do it nowadays ( to make everyone doubledip ) .	-1
I 'm pretty picky with my `` so bad it 's good '' type of flicks but if your not then this one is right up your alley . Wes Craven 's `` Swamp Thing '' was a childhood favorite of mine but it definitely belongs back there somewhere in my childhood memories . Simply defines the cheesey B action/monster flicks of the 80 's ( a stupid groaning monster , a bogus storyline , a rambo head band , some bad acting , nonsensical explosions & a great baloob shot ) truly one of Wes Craven 's worst films to date . When you watch this flick you ca n't help but to be shocked that this is made by the same man that just a few years later gives us one of the greatest horror films of all time in `` A Nightmare On Elm St '' .	-1
I can not believe people want to defend this movie as a message for caring . Ugh . Give me a break ! Others say `` what is n't tied into merchandise ? '' Well , the Care Bears merchandise did n't happen after this movie or their TV shows , it happened WELL before it . Deliberate merchandise planning overshadows any `` real '' message for kids . The dialogue is horrible , playing down to kids . the animation is before the 90s animated revolution so it 's extremely crude 80s crap . The songs are totally forgettable , especially the Carly Simon- '' I got ta pay off some bills and the IRS '' -song . Cutesy dumb caring names for the bears only makes it that much more annoying for any parent that actually had to go to the theaters with their kids and watch this drivle . And Mr Cherrywood . Where they hell has this guy been all day while Mrs Cherrywood takes care of a house full of kids ? ? All he does is tell some lame bedtime story . Well , my kids seem to enjoy it , so it keeps 'em quiet for more than an hour so I guess I should n't complain . But any parent who 's had to sit through this lobotomising feature can relate to this review ...	-1
A great classic campy film of the '80 's but this version is not for the American viewers or those who speak English , so it 's a complete waste of time .	-1
You can always tell a bomb by the picture of a scantily dressed blonde on the advertising . In KONGA , Claire Gordon is the blonde whose only function in both advertising and the film is to be the simpering yet luscious ditz that director Herman Cohen portrays her . The plot is a weird blending of numerous Big Monster films . There is KING KONG whose only serious connection to this stinker is the vaguely reminiscent name . There is GODZILLA who at least had the good sense to fight back against the soldiers ordered to bring him down . And there is MIGHTY JOE YOUNG who showed some basic need to connect with his human caretakers . KONGA , by contrast , is just plain silly . Michael Gough is the real star who steals scene after scene with his smooth hamminess . Gough is Doctor Decker , a botany professor who has lived in Uganda for a year after a plane crash during which time he learns from a shaman the secret of uncontrolled cellular growth . Decker returns to London with a cute chimp who becomes the unwilling subject of that growth . When Decker injects him with that secret substance , he immediately and against scientific law not only assumes huge proportions but also changes species from a chimpanzee to a gorilla . What follows is an illogical sequence of acts from a man who prides himself on his acumen . Gough has great fun in all this as he portrays Decker as the Mad Scientist who is as least as much interested in the charms of Miss Gordon as he is the DNA of Konga . Decker 's college class is composed exclusively of teenagers who at the drop of a hat whip out their radios and rock and roll boogaloo just like Steve McQueen and his friends from THE BLOB . Special effects range from the grotesque to the penurious . As Konga placed Decker is his hairy paw it was difficult to resist laughing as Decker kept twisting and yelling for Konga to release him . Konga is played by movie stuntman George Barrows who wore the same gorilla suit plus a diving helmet in the earlier ROBOT MONSTER but with greater believability there . At least as Ro-Man in ROBOT MONSTER Barrows tried to inject some needed vitality by swinging his arms incessantly . As Konga , Barrows does no more than lumber aimlessly as if trying to decide what to do with Decker in tow . The ending with a platoon of British soldiers is a carbon copy of innumerable movies with the army versus the Big Monster . What emerges by the last reel is a vague yet distastful feeling that we had seen this movie before in myriad manifestations -- as indeed we had .	-1
It 's a terrible movie ... but , then again , sometimes I enjoy terrible movies ! Not this one , however ; it is just bad .	-1
The Amityville Horror , 1979 filmA mother , father , and children were murdered in 1974 for no apparent motive . A year later a new family inspects this house . The price is a bargain . The saleswoman tells about the rooms in this house . [ The $ 80,000 price dates this film . ] Does the murder mean anything ? They take it . A priest knocks on the door and enters . [ Unlocked front door ! ] He hears noises . Flies are at the window pane . A door opens . `` Get out ! '' Father Delaney calls Kathy but drops the phone . A bad connection ? `` Its cold in here . '' Is the house well-insulated ? A boy slips on the stairs . George chops wood , then picks up the groceries . Little Amy tells about her friend Jody . Kathy call Father Delaney , he was to bless the house.Flushing the toilet causes an overflow of black water ! A visiting nun does n't feel well and leaves . At night the fire went out . Kathy has a nightmare while sleeping . Something happens to the priest 's car on the road ! George does n't feel well . Somehow $ 1,500 in cash disappeared from a jacket ! The babysitter is locked in a closet , Amy is gone . Kathy and George go to the reception , then return home . Jody would n't let Amy open the unlocked closet door . We hear about the financial concerns of George . A window closes on a boy 's hands ! No bones broken . They hear the buzzing of flies by an open window . The front door pops open without a cause . The police are called to the Lutz home . They have questions . Amy talks about Jody . George visited the Town Hall and the library . Kathy sees something outside the window . Their house was built on a witch 's land ! Do they need a night out ? One woman tells about the Shinnacock Indian and their use of this land.Is there something behind that brick wall ? There is a room there . `` The passage to hell ! '' A phone rings , there is no one on the line . What can they do ? Someone turned a cross upside down . They hear noise in the early morning . There is thunder and lightning . Kathy has a nightmare . So does George . Should they move away ? George is violent towards Kathy ! She looks for Father Delaney , but he has gone away . Father Boylan visits him . The police sergeant asks about Father Delaney . Kathy does research at a newspaper . She recognizes a face in the newspaper ! George returns to the house with his double-bit axe . There are strange actions . Blood drips down the stairs ! The glass windows break inwards . There are screams . The drive away in the van . Where is their dog ? The floor collapses ! The dog attacks George at first . The van leaves , they never went back to this house.This is an interesting psychological horror film for those who believe in what they say . The threats are imagined or rigged . If you are a skeptic it seems like an oddball comedy without a laugh track . Was this inspired by the murder of the John List family ? You may know of a local house where someone died violently yet there is no spooky reputation . You ca n't depend on newspapers that censor these deaths in some cases . [ Was this the inspiration for the `` Blair Witch Project '' ? ] The house where the Borden 's were murdered has been in use for 120 years without any ghostly apparitions .	-1
For it 's time , it may have been more impressive , but I thought it lacking in plot and without much `` horror '' so I 'm giving it only two stars . If you must see it , rent , do n't buy it .	-1
I grew up in the 70 's . As such I remember a select few films from that decade that struck fear in my heart at the mere mention of their title . The Excorcist , The Omen , Dawn of the Dead and The Amityville Horror . I 'd like to say that all of these films held up to the test of time but alas , one just does not make the cut . Amityville is that film.I 'll grant that I was a lot easier to scare in those days and did n't watch films with the critical eye that I do now as a reasonably intelligent adult . So I expected to be somewhat disillusioned with a movie I 'd last seen 27 years earlier . But upon viewing Amity again , I am amazed that adults were ever scared by this film when it was released much less able to sit through it in its entirety.With apologies to those who revere this film as a classic , The Amityville Horror is just a complete disaster as a film . Just because it was made in the 70 's does not qualify it as a classic . One must keep in mind that Amityville WAS NOT a B-budget chop job that simply grew a cult following . This was a major motion picture with big name actors . It does not get a break for being cheesy or camp because the cheese/camp is completely unintentional on the director 's part . The screenplay is often nonsensical , overly cryptic and repetitive in its attempt to convince us that evil is afoot . It is clear that the director was trying to achieve a subdued atmosphere of unseen evil as was done successfully in The Excorcist . But The Excorcist succeeded in achieving this atmosphere because a great deal of care went into preserving the authenticity of the characters and their world through the script and sets . We believe that the characters we see on the screen in The Excorcist could in fact exist in the real world . Further , the evil is actually defined in The Excorcist , even if it is not seen in its natural form . In Amity , the evil is never truly defined in this way . And the characters , through poor scripting just do not shine through effectively as people we might know in everyday life . These characters just walk around in a stupor hoping that will be enough to get the idea across that something is n't right.To say that the pacing of the film is wrought would be an understatement . Amity jumps around from scene to scene completely oblivious to any semblance of a compelling story arc and the editing is awful . Amityville is just a series of flat , understated scenes depicting a spectre of impending doom that never really manifests itself in any meaningful or frightening way ( unless of course you consider disappearing wedding money and James Brolin brooding about for two hours with a bad perm as meaningful and frightening . ) There 's nothing wrong with watching an old movie as a walk down memory lane . I do it all the time . But an old movie does n't necessarily make a good movie . Good old movies , while reminding one of the era in which they take place , do not allow that era to become so distracting that one ca n't still immerse himself in the story and characters . The Excorcist is the perfect example of a good older movie . I can sit down to watch that film and am immediately aware of the decade in which it takes place . But the sets and characters are so well written and depicted that I soon forget and stop caring about what year it takes place in . All I could think about as I watched Amity was how it REALLY looked like it was made 30 years ago . It relied entirely too much on cheap , now horribly dated antics like slamming doors and windows and the like to supply the horror . The horror never got to the psycholigical level as it did in The Excorcist . Perhaps it 's unfair to compare Amity to The Excorcist , but they are often mentioned in the same breath as being two of the better horror films of the 70 's . Amity just does not earn its place in that rare air . Amityville is just a dog with no teeth and bad breath when it gets right down to it .	-1
Even as an early 80 's late 70 's movie , this movie is still a very sub par film because it lackes the fear and scare scenes that a lot of this era 's movies dish out . Furthermore , many of the characters you only know because they happen to be seen in a few scenes . Other than that you do n't get a spooky atmosphere or feel empathy for any of the characters . Poorly acted and directed .	-1
I ordered this movie but it never came , contacted the seller and they were very rude , will never order from them again , still have to order this one to finish the collection off	-1
what movie were the people watching that give this tripe 5 stars ? ? ? ? ? here is a good synopsis for this movie ... .. a series of completely unexplained events followed by the end of the movie.i hope you dont waste your time on it . whats even stranger was that they made an equally bad remake of it too .	-1
The most astonishing thing about this film - stranger than paradise or hell could ever be - is that anyone let Jarmusch make another film after it wrapped . ( That it won Best First Feature at Cannes in 1984 shakes one 's faith in a rational universe . ) STP easily ranks as one of the worst movies ever made , it is so vapid and purposeless that at times one almost senses that the characters on screen are looking straight into the camera as if to say , `` Please , please give us something to do , we just ca n't take another minute of this torture ! `` Watching Stranger Than Paradise one feels compelled to laugh as the realization hits - Jarmusch wants this movie to be boring , slow , vacant , tedious , and gloomy , in short - lacking any quality that might be considered redemptive . He has a terribly clever , art-house idea ; he wants to recreate the bleak existentialism of Samuel Beckett and J.P. Sartre on film , painting meaninglessness and pointlessness in broad strokes , black and white , hollow lives played out in the absence of hope , value , or passion.What Jarmusch has missed , however , is that these writers portrayed their philosophical viewpoint in endlessly fascinating ways , masterfully crafting characters and situations . A boring , idiotic movie does n't become interesting or consequential just because you say , after the fact , `` I intended to make a boring and idiotic movie . '' That the art-house crowd fell for Stranger Than Paradise only shows that painfully chic intellectuals with delusions of hippitudinousness are more easily deceived than children - children can spot a naked emperor.While it 's hard to criticize a man who 's worked Screamin ' Jay Hawkins into two of his movies , ( Mystery Train ) , good taste in music in not nearly enough to absolve Jarmusch . Repeated viewings will cause you to be dumbstruck with wonder over and over as you wrestle with the idea that Stranger Than Paradise is as bad as it is on purpose . Deep as a Frisbee , and with luck , you might be able to fling it as far .	-1
This is a bad movie and it is not to be confused with & quot ; bad & quot ; movies that are so awful that they are entertaining . This is just slow moving , tedious stuff . There is no intended or unintended humor here . The script is bad , but not so absurd that you will laugh . It looks like a cheaply made TV movie . Just a piece of junk .	-1
Frogs here . Frogs there . Frogs everywhere . This is really a crappy movie with no worth while value . Take a nap , you 'll be better off .	-1
Tales of Terror consists of three horror stories , just my last bowel movement consisted of three turds . Too bad this movie also stinks like my last bowel movement as well !	-1
What happens when you take great actors ( Vincent Price , Peter Lorre , Basil Rathbone ) , a great writer ( Richard Matheson ) , great source material ( E.A . Poe ) and a passable director ( Roger Corman ) and have them make a movie ? Nothing very good , as it turns out.This movie is actually three short movies linked by Price 's narration . The first story deals with a young woman who returns to the home of her father , a recluse tormented by the death of his wife ; how she died is not really clear , but she is nonetheless intent on revenge . The second story - the best of the three - is a take-off on the Cask of Amontillado with Lorre as a murderous drunk . The final story has Rathbone as a mesmerist who traps Price in a state between life and death.All three stories have potential , the first and last for horror , and the middle one for humor . Unfortunately , none of the stories are executed well , a fault that seems to lie primarily with Corman . For fans of the Poe movies of the sixties ( directed primarily by Corman ) , this might be worth watching , but for horror fans , it is best to look elsewhere .	-1
I love Brenda Blethyn as an actress and Jude Law too and both give amazing performances in this film that is so boring and original I thought I 'd fall over asleep . Gretchen Mol can not act , poor girl and I pity her for that . I was surprised though and happy over Jennifer Tilly 's performance which I thought was funny ( There should have been more of her ) . Brenda and Jude did amazing performances ( as usual ) in a pretty boring film .	-1
This is one of `` those '' movies ... you know , the ones released because the lead actor got famous somewhere else and the drawers of previous work is emptied . In this case , Molly Parker from Deadwood fame.I did n't connect the dots until I got it home , I gave it a try because it sounded creepy and I have deep roots in the funeral business . The best thing I can say is it 's only 79 minutes . My finger hovered `` at the ready '' over EJECT for the entire flick . It 's pretty low budget to boot . The casket props looked like leftovers from an old horror flick ( trust me ! ) and the embalming school scene was shot at an empty junior college . No Pushover recommends dropping in at a stranger 's funeral instead of watching this .	-1
NEVER ! ! ! I WILL NEVER BUY THIS BLU RAY SET ! ! ! Just so Lucas can get even more money for these abominations ! I 'm sure I speak for many fans when I say that I want the ORIGINAL unaltered trilogy . No Greedo shooting Han first , no Hayden Christiensen in Return of the Jedi , no fornicating cgi Jawas in the background . I will not make the same mistake I made buying the 2004 dvd releases , I urge every Star Wars fan NOT to buy this version . Do the talking with your wallets and do not buy this set cuz the only thing George Lucas understands is MONEY and if he does n't get any than maybe he will come to his senses and release both `` HIS '' versions and the `` REAL '' versions in one set , which would be the logical release !	-1
I was lead to believe I would be getting both the digital remasters AND the original releases . The only reason I blew my money on this was in the hopes I could have seen the same movies that I grew up with.What a rip off .	-1
It turns out that Lucas was never as talented as anyone thought he was . The only reason why the original Star Wars films turned out to be a fun trilogy is because he was prevented by either budget or special effects limitations of the time period . Otherwise , the films would have turned out to be the overblown messes his latest trilogy is turning out to be . The evidence ? The so-called special editions of his original trilogy.The worst offenses of these retooled films arises when Lucas creates new scenes which largely consist of Jar Jar Binks level comic relief . The second worse offenses consist of unnecessary CGI characters added to pre-existing scenes which are glaringly obvious and look completely out of place . The least of Lucas ' offenses consist of touch-ups on old special effects which , in a few cases , are actual improvements . But even then , Lucas manages to screw up , especially at the end of A New Hope when the original exciting scene of the Death Star blowing up is replaced by an extremely lame burst of light.ILM has fallen too much in love with having actors perform in front of blue screens with obviously computer-generated characters . At least in the `` new '' scene of Han Solo conversing with Jabba the Hutt Harrison Ford actually got to perform on a real set , but Jabba himself looks extremely pathetic in comparison to the animatronics version seen in Return of the Jedi and , furthermore , is much smaller in size . This scene did not make the first release of A New Hope because they did not have the technology to create Jabba , but in retrospect this was a blessing . Jabba comes off as a joke when seen walking beside Han and demanding his money.For those who have only seen the retooled ET on DVD , Spielberg 's changes ( e.g . replacing the government agents ' guns with walkie-talkies , and cleaning up the kids ' dialogue ) are far less ridiculous or a kick in the fans ' teeth in comparison to the changes Lucas made . Lucas and Spielberg really need to leave their old movies alone . I dread to think what would happen to THX-1138 ( a happy ending complete with a Busby Berkley muscial number and guest appearances by a computer generated Elmo perhaps ? ) .	-1
I just read about some MORE changes Lucas has made to these 3 DVDs ... .while I enjoyed the special editions and really only felt that having Greedo shoot first was pretty stupid considering it lessens Han evolution from scoundral to hero it was relatively minor.BUT NOW:1 . Hayden Christienson 's face will CGI 'd over Sebastion Shaw 's face in Jedi for the Darth Vader death Scene ? I have no problem with Hayden..I actually like his Annakin but that is just so damn stupid ! The scene is fine leave it alone ! 2.Ian Mcdiarmid will be replacing Clive Revill as the Emperor in Empire Strikes back . How silly is that not only does it not make a difference as it is one scene but why waste the time and money to do so ? George Lucas ' new changes reminds of when I was a kid and would try to rework some of my artwork after I had already finished it cause I just did n't like this little thing or that..until I finally wore a hole in the picture and it was not any good anymore.I am soo not a fanatic about this stuff I love the prequels films..not as much as the original films but I do love them . But it just feels like one of these days George is just going to remake the entire films get new actors and just redo the whole damn first trilogy..can you picture it ? Leonardo Decaprio as LukeBrad Pitt as Han Solo ( Or Orlando Bloom ) Kira Knightly or Kirsten Dunst as Princess Leia ... Not that I dislike any of these actors but could you really see them as these characters ... .Sigh I am sooooo disapointed that the joy of these films I had for so many years is being disregarded by Mr. Lucas that he thinks the films are of such poor quality that he needs to keep tinkering with them until the do not resemble the originals at all . I am very sad and disapointed and now I think I 've finally lost my patience with this DVD set and will not be buying it ... .I have a good widescreen undoctored set of the original films on VHS and I think I will just stick to those .	-1
So I hear that the original Star Wars Trilogy will finally be released on DVD this October . It 's about time Lucus stopped being such a weenie ! : ) However ... I hear that the versions on the DVDs will be the 20th anniversary & quot ; Special Editions , & quot ; with all the computer-generated extra stuff . I do n't know about you , but I want the & quot ; original theatrical & quot ; widescreen versions . I mean , you can enhance the picture quality if you want to , or treat the sound to some THX love , but do n't add the other stupid things to the movie we all love ! I will NOT buy the DVDs if this is the version they release . If you want to have BOTH versions of each film in the set , like they just did with the Aliens series , then that would be perfect , but please , please , please -do n't omit the theatrical versions ! -A concerned fan .	-1
I did n't mind when Lucas came out last year with the extended re digitalized set , but this is just too much . Frankly I 'm not happy with this because the box is definatly cooler then the old one . Who would n't want the original picturing on their box of star wars ? But the fact remains that Lucas is squeezing the life from the trilogy by reselling and reselling the old material in new packaging . When will he stop ? Maybe start giving us newer editions of Indiana Jones instead.Buy this edition if you have n't already been scammed into buying his last year edition . Like I said , the box is definatly way cooler , but the principles that Lucas is displaying is sorry indeed for the market , heck forget the market . What about us poor college buyers that would kill for this edition ?	-1
Special Edition ... Ha give me the originals thankyou very much.George Lucas forgot how to make movies ... as seen by the new ones .	-1
I do n't know what Star Wars reviews from other Star Wars DVDs doing on this trilogy set but all the reviews about this set has nothing to do with they are all same and go with Star Wars DVD blurry set which has Star Wars darth vader blue cover on it I have seen these same reviews from other sets amazon is selling. , I found out cant find site but steel case version of this same set is same as this one they both do not include theatrical theater version in this set this set includes new scenes Lucas has added to original episodes jaba talking to Han before he boards ship to fly to Death Star , stromtroopers on animals in desert looking for c3po , and r2d2 before Kawasaki capture them.Amazon has to delete all reviews for under this set by other members they are talking about other box sets not the new which came out October 8 2013	-1
I will not purchase any Star Wars product until Lucas provides the original three movies - with a quality transfer - in blu ray . And by original , I mean the original version that I watched in theaters 30+ years ago .	-1
Dont get me wrong i love the trilogy , is just that in this blu-ray there is no special features and that is why am giving it a 1 out of 5 . They want to push the consumer to buy the expensive 6 volume saga and there you will find the special features , but those of us that cant afford it are stuck with this ... I do n't recommend this product if your a hardcore fan .	-1
This is the problem that George Lucas 's staff has been working with for the past couple of years . Here 's one of the answers , Re-release the same films ... again and the people will buy them ... again . Originally , I was on-board and gung ho for all of these movies , but geez ! And- WHY ca n't we get the ORIGINAL , digitally enhanced , but not ALTERED on DVD ? I have the VHS tapes that were released before the three newest films , and as much as I ca n't stand the poor quality , I will not give another dime to these movies . Just because the newest films have new actors , why do we have to ignore the work of the actors that gave us the originals ? Do n't buy these movies . It 's simply a way to get your money . Besides , like a previous reviewer said- they 'll be re-re-released again anyway ... Rent em from Blockbuster .	-1
little brats who grew up in a fake world , buying fake music ( like Britney Spears , and Nsync ) , watching fake movie stars ( like Jennifer lopez , and Lidsey Lohan ) , and growing up with a fake president ( George W. Bush ) .It 's no surprise that this generation is able to tolerate the new `` fake '' versions . Not only has this generation been brainwashed to love `` fake '' , but they also get bored very easily . They cant be happy surfing the net , unless they are talking on their instant messenger . They cant be happy taking a walk down the street , unless they are talking on the cell phone . Im sure the original version of star wars must seem very boring to a generation raised on Barney the Dinosaur . That 's why Lucas added Barney ( A.K.A . Jar , Jar , Binks ) to his films .	-1
You know Lucas can do whatever he wants to his movies . They are his creations . They are his artistic vision . Where he is wrong though is not including the original versions and remastering them for HI-def as an option . No other filmmaker has done what he has which is basically not acknowledging the existance of the original version . Yes these are his movies , but they also belong to us the fans because the fans support and love for these films made it the phenomena that it is . Sorry Mr. Lucas but I will not be ordering these . I 'll stick to the laser discs.You know on second thought all these changes since the 1997 Special Editions til now have only made them consistent with the mediocrity of the Prequels . I always believed that the Original Trilogy existed in its own parallel universe separate from the six episode series anyway . Sort of a `` Mirror Universe '' version of Star Wars which is fine . The George Lucas of 2011 is certainly not the George Lucas of 1977 . So these new versions of Star Wars should be called Star Wars : The Rise and Fall and Redemption of Anakin Skywalker which is the way Lucas sees these films as nowadays . The Original Trilogy should exist as Star Wars : The Adventures of Luke Skywalker which I believe was the original conceptualization of the series . This if I remember correctly was used for the original novelizations of the trilogy.Darth Vader was always a much more interesting character when his origins were a mystery and only hinted at . This only enhanced his legend , mythology and aura which is why everybody loved this character in the first place . He was essentially a sci-fi version of the '' boogie man '' . The Original Trilogy made him the pop culture icon that he WAS . Unfortunately these special edition versions basically broke down Dart Vader into something a lot less . Lucas essentially made him into some gifted and whiny kid who was screaming out for help . This is fine if that is what Lucas wants of course . But as I said earlier give the fans the option of which version they want to see . There is no reason why they cant both exist . It is a big universe anyway.What I would like to see in an original trilogy Blu-ray set : Restored unaltered versions of the Trilogy with cleaned up effects and Original sound mixes as an option.Deleted scenesOriginal Making of documentaries.Star Wars to Jedi DocumentaryEmpire of Dreams DocumentaryStar Wars Holiday Special ( Restored and Remastered ) Vintage Interviews with cast and crewAudio CommentariesNew documentary on the Star Wars Phenomena from a 1970 's early 80 's point of view which includes vintage toy commercials , actor and character appearances on such shows as Donnie and Marie , The Richard Pryor Show , The Muppet Show , etc . and interviews with illuminaries and fans of the period.New documentary on the merchandising bonanza of the series.Promotional art and trailers	-1

I am ... . Not a huge Star Wars fan . Far from one . I consider the original Star Wars films to be classics , but my knowledge of the Star Wars 'universe ' is hardly up to expactations . Even so , I consider Lucas 's edits and changes to be offensive . So ... All you psychologically abused elitists who rant on about `` LolO sTOp coMPLainiGn StAr WErs NerdS '' can be quiet.As one 'genius ' raves , `` GORGE LOOKAS HAS TEH ARTISTIC FREEDOM ! ! HE MADE TEH MOVAYS NOT U ! `` Very true . He has the right to make his movies crap , and we , the consumers , have the right to state the fact that these new 'special editions ' ARE crap.Everyone I 've seen ranting on about 'artistic freedom ' completely miss the point , because they 're too busy consuming Lucas 's half-*ssed edited garbage.Overall , Lucas is an egomaniacal hack who refuses to put in minimal effort to please his REAL fans.. Instead , he 'd rather advertise his terrible prequels in the context of once-great films , and edit `` ADULFT CONTENTW @ 1 '' .Absolutely terrible . I hope stuck-up directors who respect themselves more than their real fans are in the minority . I 'd give this a zero if I could .	-1
While I 'm happy that I have my ( terrible transfer ) `` bonus disc '' versions of the original trilogy on DVD , I do n't understand why the studio that released such excellent box sets for the Alien saga on Blu ( which included both Theatrical and Altered versions of all four films ) can not do a similar release for the Star Wars Trilogy.Many mention the terrible changes to Star Wars . To be a little different , I 'll talk about Empire . Changing a line ( spoken to a robot ) from `` You 're lucky you do n't taste very good '' to `` You 're lucky to be alive . '' Adding that goofy scream when Luke plummets to his fate ( which I heard they then took out , and put back in softened , and who knows what will be on this release ? ) . The terrible re-edit with flash cuts and CG imperial shuttle in the last 10 minutes of the movie . Taking the time to CG up all the effects , but still not getting rid of the blue screen artifact `` boxes '' around the asteroids and tie fighters ( I mean , if you 're going to `` fix '' it , then go ahead and fix it ) . Not that I mind the boxes . They were a product of when the movie was made , and I like that . I like time capsules on film , which is exactly why I do n't like the `` special '' editions.So , yeah . Fox/Lucas wo n't be getting my money until the original theatrical versions of the trilogy gets a proper release on Blu . If it 's not better than the blurry sub-standard ones they already put out on DVD , I 'll still be saving my money .	-1
Heck , thank god he had nothing to do with anything else except Star Wars . I know , there 's Indiana Jones , but I think it 's safe to say that Spielberg wo n't let him ruin that too.That 's what the new fans ca n't understand about us who ca n't stand the new versions . It 's not just that he 's creating new effects , it 's that he 's ruining the experience by destroying the original . They ca n't understand it because it has n't happened to them yet . To love something for decades , realizing that you contributed to enlarge its creator 's bank account , and to hear from his own mouth that that thing you once loved does n't exist anymore simply because he feels like butchering it . Those who think he 's right should be aware that by endorsing this action they might fall victim of someone else doing the same with something THEY love in the future . Then they will understand.Speaking about George Lucas , I really ca n't understand him . On one side it looks like all he cares about is profit , on the other , he reduces said profit by alienating many ( if not most ) of the people who helped him built his own empire . Maybe all he wants is to generate discussion so he can be just as famous as his creation . I do n't know.So let 's just be thankful all he can ruin are the Star Wars movies . Can you imagine the atrocities Lucas would have done to films like Casablanca . To fit with the Star War films , he would probably turn all the soldiers into imperial troopers , replace Louis Armstrong with some childish CGI character and change the title to `` Mos Eisley '' . That would be the day .	-1
today I went to visit Morty in the home . I took him this collection of Star Wars as I remember he likes captain kirk . We have to watch a movie during his prescribed one hour sitz bath . I am so glad I brought this movie for Morty to watch . It made Morty a little frisky to see that princess gal , he wanted to get into my groceries , hee hee hee ...	-1
Yet again , Lucas screws with what was once perfection . I deserve better than this - and so does my money .	-1
I have upgraded all my essential movies from VHS to DVD . I wish I could do that with my Star Wars trilogy , but this is not it . These are the `` Special Editions '' and not the original far superior films.I have no desire to own the Star Wars butchered edition movies !	-1
If the mighty Sith Lord Lucash would openly and honestly state that the DVD box set version is in fact different from both the original ( theatrical ) and even the special edition ( also theatrical ) versions then at least he would be spared all the venom and vitriol that has been and is being thrown at him . Indeed , the issue is not whether Darth Lucash may or may not ( yet again ) make changes to Episodes 4 , 5 , and 6 . Yes , they are his creations and his properties ; he may do with them as he wishes . Yet he does have at least an ethical obligation to disclose the fact that they are different from the previously released versions and not pass them off as the same - as shown by the line & quot ; Own the Original & quot ; . After all , the disclaimer is the standard industry practice adopted by everyone else , including his colleague Steven Spielberg , who clearly states that his & quot ; E.T . : Special Edition & quot ; is different from the original & quot ; E.T. & quot ; and unlike Lucash makes both & quot ; E.T. & quot ; versions available on DVD .	-1
A friend of mine clued me into his pet term for the Star wars rerelease films , now reissued on video - the `` very special '' editions , as in the `` very special '' episodes of sitcoms or `` very special '' like Jason Biggs ' trumpeteer is perceived to be in `` American Pie 2 '' . In short , the original Star Wars films were reduced to treacle when , in their rerelease form , they could have garnered a new generation of fans.Let me qualify something here . You are not a bigger Star Wars fan than I am , nor do I `` not get it '' . I was born in 1975 . My earliest Christmas pictures have me standing next to a Death Star toy with assorted characters and playsets strewn about . I got Boba Fett , Yoda , and the Emperor in plain , small cardboard boxes via mail order . I saw Star Wars in rerelease when I was four , saw Empire at the Ziegfield in NY when I was five , and was first in line for both ROTJ and TPM on their opening days . In-between all that , add in the countless video games , comic collecting , book reading , and whatnot , it all adds up to one thing - I have a deep affection for the Star Wars franchise , but that does n't mean a slavish devotion to George Lucas ' decision-making.People say Lucas has a right to do whatever he wants with his original trilogy films . This is incorrect . Technically , as he owns them , he can do whatever he wishes . However , especially fourteen years after the fact ( 1983-1997 ) , the films have a cultural resonance and are beloved for what is in them . Fundamentally changing them would be like DaVinci adjusting the smile on Mona Lisa 's face or Shakespere deciding that Ophelia and Hamlet ride off into the sunset together . There is a cultural point , that all artists usually have the good sense to recognize , when their art takes on a life of its own and is no longer simply theirs.George Lucas does n't seem to get this . So much of what he does in the Special Editions is strong - the tidying up of effects , the cleaning up of the negative and the sound , and even the addition of some scenes constitute a director 's right to go back and try to make his film better . What Lucas does , though , is go beyond this . Whether by making Greedo shoot first , Luke scream after tossing himself into the void , adding Jedi Rocks while removing the original song , or even changing the end music and sequence for ROTJ , Lucas has done more than tweak the mechanics and flow of his film . He has , instead , fundamentally altered our perception of events and of how we process and experence the films . In short , he has taken something familiar and made it into something cold and alien . There is no excuse for this.For a generation of inspired 20 and 30-somethings , along with their parents , Star Wars represented something familiar , something good , and something we wanted to be associated with . The '97 rerelease , represented here in this collection instead left us feeling unwelcome , as if Lucasfilm decided we had lived out our usefulness and was moving onto a new audience , one that had to have Vader 's return to his ship at the end of ESB explained and shown step by step . Very special , indeed.While there are aspects of the special editions that are good , the negatives far outweigh the positives and it pains me to say that this Star Wars collection is not worth having over the original versions . You would be better off finding those or getting copies of them than you would owning and watching the special editions .	-1
This is a note to my friends and family : DO NOT BUY THIS FOR ME AS A GIFT ! IT 'S NOT WHAT I WANT . IT 'S NOT THE ORIGINAL 3 FILMS , IT 'S THE SPECIAL ADDITION . The packaging should state : Bespin now with 20 % more windows .	-1
Ok , wow , I just finished watching my brand new set of DVDs . I was horrified to see the Anakin change in Jedi , but after a little while , I realize it 's not the end of the world . All I really wanted was to see the deleted/altered scenes . They could have squeezed them in anywhere . I hate the 1997 ending of Jedi and I really wish they had taken out the Jabba/Han scene because Jabba looks so fake . All I wanted was to see the original ending because it 's virtually impossible to find these days . Though I will treasure my new dvds , they could have been so much more than they were . If you are a true Star Wars fan , I would reccommend renting these and waiting a year till Lucasfilm gets it right and releases either the original movies to dvds or a set of dvds that allows you to watch the beloved scenes from the original movies that have been hacked to pieces with `` better technology . ''	-1
If you have any love for the original `` Star Wars '' Trilogy you WILL NOT buy this set ! Lucas knows that even if it sucks , we will pay for anything that has the name `` Star Wars '' written on it . By saying , `` Well , it 's the lame-o Special Edition , but it 's better than nothing '' and shelling out hard earned money for this set , you 're just playing into his hands ! We need to rise up against Lucas ! He has gone to the Dark Side ! Send a message that he had no right to change OUR movie just because HE was n't satisfied with it . This trilogy is bigger than him , and it 's bigger than all of us ! So go forth and protest , and may the Force be with you.PS-I actually give it ZERO stars , but that was n't an option .	-1
buy the version with the original film - this is waste	-1
I 'm going to keep my review short . What George Lucas has done to these original films is shameful . For me , it 's like Claude Monet going back to one of his original , innovative , beautiful paintings and adding is some junk that should n't be there . Another analogy I like to use is David Gilmour , guitarist from Pink Floyd , going back to `` Wish You Were Here '' and adding in guitar parts that never existed in the original recording.The fact that Lucas would even allow CGI to be inserted into the original films is completely moronic and uncalled for . What he 's done is he 's thrown all of the hard work the production staff , costume designers , set designers , etc . have done down the toilet . I ca n't imagine what these people who worked on these films thought of their work after seeing these butchered versions . Lucas should have learned his lesson by now . You do n't tamper with the movies that made your name and brought you millions of dollars . It 's as simple as that.Lucas , if you have any shred of sympathy in your body , then release the original theatrical versions of these films . Nobody cares what you think of the films now or what direction you think they should go in . Leave your art alone ! ! !	-1
Three ? Why only THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN ? It 's a pretty big fountain , and production costs could n't have been that high to begin with . Depending how you look at it , this fountain is either half-empty or half-full ; I lean towards the former , but see the movie and decide for yourself .	-1
How unfortunate that this movie was released on DVD by one of only several studios that refused initially to accept the anamorphic format.What this means , is that if you own a 16x9 television , you will not only have the black bars on the top and bottom , but on the sides as well . If you use the ZOOM feature of your 16x9 tv , it fills the screen , but it pixilates and degrades the video terribly . So you 'll end up watching it in full letterbox hell.Do n't buy this , until they do the right thing and re-release it in anamorphic widescreen . After all , they DID release it in anamorphic widescreen in EUROPE . [ ... ] Good viewing , everyone .	-1
I thought this was the worst film I had ever seen . Then I saw Antitrust . The Edge is now the second worst film I have ever seen.Still , I got a good laugh out of the part where the desperate city-folk stranded in the wilderness use POINTED STICKS to defeat the merciless man-eating bear twice their height - and then appear in the very next scene in very dapper , matching bear-skin vests .	-1
Historical iaccuracies and inanities abound in this moribund tale . The truthful telling would have more than made Miller 's `` witchhunt '' point without the needless and innacurate sexual intrigue . For Miller supposedly researching this tale with such diligence , it really is a mess .	-1
The book was very good but the movie version was n't . Julia Ormond does her best acting ( that 's not saying much ) as Smila . The audience needs to sympathize with Smila but she 's so abrasive and self pitying it 's hard to . Instead of returning to Greenland and her dead mother 's Inuit culture she stays in Europe and sulks about it . Her only friend is an Inuit boy who was , she suspects , murdered . Her lonely task , for no-one , not even the boy 's half witted mother seems to care about him , is to find out who did it and why.Which leads me to the ending . It was one of the most unsatisfying , ubelievable resolutions I 've ever seen in a movie . In all , Smila 's Sense of Snow is a movie that could 've been good but never quite makes the mark . Perhaps a different actress ( Would it have been impossible to find a real Inuit or at least one who looked right ? ) Perhaps a more vigorous director , perhaps a better script and perhaps an ending that made a lick of sense could 've saved this movie but none of that happened so we 're left with a mess .	-1
Did not care for the sexual theme throughout this movie . Poor taste.Theme was ok but why display everything and sex before marriage is taken to lightly . Did not approve of content .	-1
What a piece of junk ! A ship instead of a bus , so they have to search for something to crash into . A computergenius who takes over the ship and nobody simply puls the plug on the computers and resumes manual steering . It is a ship , for crying out loud , not a supercritical airplane ! The original speed kept up the pace . With this movie I kept it up by pushing fast-forward for minutes on end . And then the cast : Dafoe tries to be really bad , but in the end he was the only guy I grew to like . Bullock gave a repeatperformance of the original , without the zest of the original and Patric instead of Reeves is like being out of the frying pan and into the fire . The equivalent of two dollars that I paid to rent this tape was the biggest waste of money ever .	-1
The only thing that 's watchable here is . . . . wait , let me rephrase that . There is absolutely NOTHING watchable here . The plot is ridiculous , the characters are thin and annoying ( especially Dafoe , who is in fact a great actor elsewhere ) , the action sequences are nothing but silly and painful to watch , and the script is . . . well , the script is n't as bad as the one for Batman & Robin , but it 's STILL bad . What made Jan de Bont think he could try to surpass the classic original ? Well , whatever happened , this movie turned out to be very worthless . Pass .	-1
Speed 2 Cruise Control why ? Why why why ? Speed did n't need a sequel & I 'll be honest I saw in theaters when I was 11 & I enjoyed it then I saw it on VHS & stunk have n't seen it since & it 's far worse than I remember this is 1 of the worst sequels ever I only have it in my collection cause of the positive reviews like Siskel & Ebert gave it 2 thumbs up no joke . I like Roger Ebert but this is my prime example of why I do n't take critics advice a majority of the time . I mean Ebert did n't like Robocop 2 & that is 1 of the most underrated sequels ever he did n't like Predator 2 which is another highly & criminally underrated sequels . The high praise did n't stop there Joel Siegel who seems like a really nice guy & I miss him liked him on GMA before it became an entertainment show . Speed 2 does n't have hold your breath action it does have a lot explosions & effects but it better since it was made on $ 160 million it tanked at the box office it made $ 16 million it 's opening weekend $ 48 million in The US & a $ 164 million some will say that 's not a box office bomb but there 's extra money that goes into the marketing advertising TV ads posters as well as gross share among theaters . It was directed by Jan de Bont & he pretty much ruined his career with this movie & he helped write the script with Randall McCormick & Jeff Nathanson . Which Randall McCormick helped write Titan AE & The Scorpion King sequels . Jeff Nathanson has had somewhat a better track record . Keanu Reeves did n't return now say what you want but Keanu Reeves was great in the 1st movie on i m d b it says that Keanu Reeves wanted to tour with his band Dog Star & he did another large scale action film Chain Reaction . I do n't care what reason it was he was smart from staying away from this & he went on to do The Matrix movies along with Constantine . Our replacement is Jason Patric Jason Patric are you kidding me . He stars as Alex Shaw . So that shows you that they could n't get a strong lead . I mean Jason Patric never drew a dime . Out of all the actors in 1997 you got Jason Patric who I do n't buy at all & is fairly wooden . Sandra Bullock comes back as Annie & Sandra Bullock only did this movie cause it was in her contract & she wanted to get her movie Hope Floats financed . & Williem Dafoe as John Geiger . The story is Annie is taking this driving test & she 's yapping , yapping yapping her character is more of an air head Sandra Bullock gives a disjointed performance . She 's not with Jack Traven anymore cause 2 years ago he got her Pepper Spray she thought it was Perfume so she used it & had to go to the hospital & how stupid is that & btw G o d forbid that Jack cared about you enough to get you means to defend yourself plus you leave him cause his job was dangerous so she 's with Alex Shaw a SWAT Team Cop she thinks that he 's a Beach Cop he 's off chasing a Delivery Van that 's full of stolen items & it 's a s # ! *y chase so when she finds out he 's on a SWAT Team same 1 as Jack cause you have a cameo by Joe Morton basically he surprises Annie with `` 2 tickets to paradise ! '' They go on a cruise to The Caribbean . Now if Annie left Jack cause of his dangerous job why would she stay with Alex . BTW a Cruise is just stupid for a Speed movie it 's not as exciting as Bus that has bomb on it & you have to keep it above 50 or the bomb will go off . I know I might get a comment asking me `` What did you want a rehash ? '' No cause Speed did n't need a sequel . The Villain John Geiger is plotting & planning & is planning to hack into the ship & mess it up he worked for The Cruise Ship Company & he worked in some computerized stuff & he got sick for it somehow & he was fired so he 's somehow getting revenge . He has this computer equipment hidden in Golf Clubs which feels straight out of a Disney movie . You have this romance angle with Alex & Annie which I do n't care for cause they did n't click like Sandra Bullock & Keanu Reeves did . You also have this deaf girl that likes Alex . Geiger kills The Captain in a very stupid way also The Bell Boy or whatever he is goes into Geiger 's room he sees his set up he knocks that Bell Boy or whatever he is out & leaves him in the closet . You know Geiger is out of the room for a long time ok why does n't that idiot LEAVE ! The engine messes up & I feel asleep yes I did this movie is that boring . 1 of the passengers asks if it 's an earthquake . I do n't know if you can feel an earthquake on water but if you ca n't then that is some of stupidest dialogue . Like I said I feel asleep & the rest of this movie is people running around on the ship & the ship is flooding Sandra Bullock has 1 cool scene chainsaw to cut open an opening to let these people get through . There 's 1 little decent scene with Alex saving the deaf girl . It becomes dull again though with Alex chasing Geiger . They try to stop The Cruise Ship by taking ropes or whatever & tying it around the propeller Geiger takes Annie hostage so of course Alex has to save her but they bypass an Oil Tanker but are headed towards ST Martin Town & to try to be funny they show several passengers saying oh s * * t & anytime they attempt to be funny it fails . I 'll get to some more examples of it . You have this black guy who likes taking picture everybody could die & he 's still taking pictures . They crash into this Harbor Town I can see the budget on screen but this was hundreds of millions of dollars wasted . Cause I was n't impressed cause this is just my opinion you can have the biggest runaway budget if I do n't care about my characters & there 's nobody to root for I ai n't giving the movie the pass just cause their is explosions on screen & you can see the budget on the screen . Oh yeah The Anchor on the ship falls on this guys car & he yells `` Oh my G o d my Car ! '' again trying to be funny & failing . The icing on the cake though is remember that man with the dreadlocks in the well he happens to in the island & now he has his boat taken over this time the movie is telling you `` HEY WE 'RE FUNNY ! '' You have Geiger trying to get to his Sea Plane he has Annie with him they 're on these Double Jet Ski thing she uses a release the 1 Geiger is on & he yells `` Get back here you 're my hostage ! '' The is completely cheesy very , very , very , very corny . I know some might bring up Howard Payne Dennis Hopper but Dennis Hopper did a really good job & he did n't feel like a villain from a kids movie & this movie being PG 13 did n't help maybe Williem Dafoe could 've played a more disturbed maybe darker villain if it was rated R. Geiger gets to Annie & gets her to a plane Alex catches up takes a Spear Gun to get to the plane he saves Annie & Geiger crashes the plane into an Oil Tanker where he does the really goofy annoying laugh cause he 's trying to sound creepy the plane blows up Alex gives Annie a ring asking her if she wants to Marry him & she accepts . Speed 2 Cruise Control there 's a reason why so many people hate this movie mainly The Cruise Ship does n't give you the feeling of speed & the movies called speed . There 's no characters to root for or to care about except for the deaf girl . Generic action scenes goofy villain that feels like he belongs in a kids movie . Mark Mancina 's score is n't any good compared to the score from the 1st movie that added to the suspense tension & gave it the feel of you need to get there now . Jan de Bont did an awful job if it was in his contract that he had to do Speed 2 then I feel sorry for him . Jason Patrics u ck ed . Sandra Bullock gave a disjointed performance . Williem Dafoe gave a very awful performance . Speed 2 is 1 of those you need to see just to say you saw it . I mean I had n't seen it since I saw The VHS way back when I only have it on DVD cause I can laugh at the critics who gave it praise . Just go watch the original Speed it 's celebrating it 's 20th anniversary .	-1
... .with a handful of notable exceptions , sequels do n't have a good rap . This is a classic example , and when nearly everyone is saying the same thing ( `` it rots '' ) there must be something to it . And so it is with `` Speed 2 : Cruise Control '' -- it 's a nifty title , but the positives pretty much end there . Everyone loved the original `` Speed '' , but this soggy sequel-of-sorts is capsized by a lame plot and ridiculous dialogue . Even worse , Sandra Bullock 's spunky Annie -- who was nice-girl sexy , smart and likable in the bus thriller -- -is cut down to a dumb , one-dimensional second banana on the cruise ship . Many films have been illuminated by Bullock 's star-power , but S2CC 's scribes have doused that light for fair . Thus , Jason Patric 's character ( also one-dimensional ) is pretty much left to save the day single-handedly , over and over again . Just one act of heroism involving extreme athletics is enough to wind most guys , but poor Jason is sent to save fellow passengers from certain death , have shootouts with a cartoon villain ( a cruelly cast Willem Dafoe ) , dive under the ship to keep it from ramming a tanker , steal a speedboat , chase an airplane on water ( and actually catch up to it ) ... .one brave feat after another without missing a beat ... ..well , that 's how I spend a Saturday afternoon , do n't you ? Escapist fun is one thing , but this goes from inane to boring to completely unbelievable . The climax comes too late to save this doomed feature ... ..just watch the original `` Speed '' again instead . It 's much more worth your time .	-1
& quot ; Speed 2 & quot ; seemingly has absolutely nothing to do with the first , superior & quot ; Speed , & quot ; by having only Sandra Bullock and her new LAPD/SWAT boyfriend ( not Keanu Reeves ) go on a cruise ship and have it technically hijacked by sick madman Willem Dafoe , in one of his worst roles EVER.Futhermore , Jan De Bont further ruins the movie by adding unnecessary details like the large cruise ship , eccentric passengers , desperate crew , and by making it louder than necessary , while & quot ; Speed & quot ; has a simple plot and a electrically charged screenplay to work with.In other words , the movie is loud , totally unnecessary , acting is loud and overstated , and is totally bad . The only reason I give it two stars is because Bullock manages through this turgid mess with a straight face and her hilarious lines make this a bearable action & quot ; thriller. & quot ; Rated PG-13 for violence and profanity .	-1
A warning to those thinking of purchasing this DVD . I purchased it on the basis of the glowing reviews posted here . Reviews that called this flawless , brilliant , the greatest TV program ever , etc . I confess that I only watched 2 episodes before putting this one away . It is extremely disturbing . The imagery in it is grotesque , potentialy offensive , and deeply disturbing . If you are a viewer who considers anything gross that pushes the boundries of acceptability art , then you will like this show . But if you are not entertained by depressing and disturbing images and topics , stay away from this one . Many people found the movie Silence of the Lambs about a murderous cannibal & quot ; brilliant and entertaining. & quot ; If you loved Silence of the Lambs you will probably love this too . Otherwise think twice before buying this title .	-1
`` Glory '' is one of my favorite films and I expected great things from this `` Special Edition . '' It still is a great film and one of the best ever about the Civil War and the introduction of Black troups into that contflict . What I really wanted to see was the black bars at the botton and top of the screen ; the true widescreen version . But buyers beware . This is a glorified full screen version ( know your screen ratios , folks ) and I got burned . Is there a true widescreen version of this film ? It deserves a better transfer than this .	-1
This decent but far from excellent drama has a couple of good moments and manages to give some insight into the American Civil War , still it ` s way too overrated and glorified . Director Edward Zwick wants to praise the black soldiers ` stenght and relevant contribution , yet unfortunately his perspective is too similar to that of an average , altough well-intended , TV-movie . Sure , there are plenty of good performances here ( Matthew Broderick , Denzel Washington , Morgan Freeman , most of the cast is fine , to be fair ) and the settings are competent enough , but the movie drags in many moments , has too many patchy scenes and the annoying and awe-inspiring score doesn ` t help . & quot ; Glory & quot ; is a relevant document , not quite a particularly strong and impressive cinematic experience . It ` s overlong , predictable and more PC than it really needed to , delivering an ok but nothing special movie . Good to kill a couple of hours and even think a bit , but a masterpiece it is not.Competently made and watchable enough .	-1
This film combines these two genres and is kind of unsuccessful.There are some interesting action scenes and it does capture the essense of the late '80 's action flicks very well , but you 're thankful at the end of how short it is .	-1
Audrey looks beautiful and does a great job ; Connery , Shaw , Williamson and the rest are terrific ; but the plot is very slow and , as my husband said , & quot ; has holes that you could drive a truck through. & quot ; There are too many long , tedious sword fights and too many long gallops across the English countryside with romantic music playing . And the ending was a little too corny , even for romantics like me . Better than Audrey 's & quot ; Paris When it Sizzles , & quot ; but still not her best .	-1
Well , having just watched this again for the first time since 1985 , I found it pretty trite , surprisingly old-fashioned , and lacking in the script department . As usual with a big ensemble cast , the characters are all stereotypes . Rob Lowe 's rosy cheeks make him seem like he should have stuck to after-school specials , even though the girls of the time loved him . Only Demi Moore 's acting stands out a bit here , and , true to form , she is probably still the biggest star of the bunch almost 30 years later . Evidently this got savaged by the critics of the day . They were not wrong .	-1
While I think it 's funny , entertaining , and even touching to watch , I ca n't help but think how absurd it is for a group of twenty-two-year-old preppies , just out of college , to be reminiscing about & quot ; the good old days & quot ; and longing for their lost youth , as if they were 80-year-old men and women looking back on their lives . They 've barely begun their lives , and already they 're dwelling on their regrets . I think Mare Winningham does a wonderful job as the shy virgin . Judd Nelson is terrific as the ambitious preppie . Demi Moore is perfect as the shallow vixen , although her raspy voice is annoying . Emilio Estevez is only moderately engaging in his role , but he does have some of the best lines . Rob Lowe 's character is overacted and unconvincing . Andrew McCarthy is just plain annoying ( Somebody please wipe that stupid smirk off his face ) . All in all , a watchable , enjoyable film , whose only real flaw is the premise . If you want a brat-pack movie , try THE BREAKFAST CLUB , instead .	-1
