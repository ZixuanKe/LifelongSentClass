I bought my first HP12C in about 1984 or so , and it served me faithfully until 2002 when I lost it while travelling . I searched for another one to replace it , but found one difficult to come by in my area . So , I decided to buy up and purchased an HP 49G . What a mistake ! I know that many people view the HP 49G ( now 49G+ ) as the flagship of the HP line , but for me that was a disaster.The 49G may be powerful , but using it is extremely counterintuitive ... and the manual was sketchy at best . The 12C , on the other hand , does what I need in a way that makes good sense to me.If you are looking for a solid , reliable calculator , the HP12C may be for you . It 's programmable . It does basic statistics well , and many business applications too . The manual makes sense ; you will be up and running in short order.I 'm ready to set my 49G aside and move back to my old friend . I did n't even have to replace the batteries in well over a decade of use ! HP 12C , I 'm coming home !	1
WHY THIS BELATED REVIEW ? I feel very obliged to share my views about this old workhorse , the HP12C GOLD at its 25th anniversary and my 1Oth year as a satisfied ower user and fan . Especially after sharing my frank views on Amazon about two of its three successors on Amazon.com , burying the HP12c Platinum ( 2004 1st release , HP12cP ) and praising the HP12c Platiunum Anniversary Edition ( 2006 3rd release , HP12cPAE or HP12cPA ) .To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans , including the non-techkie nerd like myself , the name Hewlett-Packard To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans . The brandname of Hewlett-Packard is synonymous with the highest quality and best range offered in handheld electronic business financial calculators before the first generation of personal computers hits the desktops of business users.To date ( December 2007 ) , the bearer of this `` gold '' standard is none other than the HP12C HP 's `` golden boy '' in its calculator business segment.The HP12C now a matured product , is the only continuing HP handheld surviving calculator product since '81 and probably the longest selling electronic calculator ever . According to HP almost 15 million HP 12Cs , cPs was sold since , it is probably the best selling HP ( and RPN ) calculator ever.As a proven product , the HP12C `` gold '' works from day 1 , with its form factor and sofware remaining unchanged and has not been dethroned by rivals and even its HP successors which had come and go.Even with PC software versions being sold , the 12C remains the truly indispensable `` portable '' finance-business heldheld computer for its owners , professionals and students alike . This handy companion powers up immediately and is faster than any portable personal computers to jump right into the action.The HP12C is a serious product and the ultimate time tested solution , field tested proven by its users and survived all its rival products , the workhorse moves on.Anyone in charge of this HP line should always bear in mind that the continued production run of the HP 12c is a testimony of HP 's quality and standard expected by its customers.Do n't just listen to a HP12C fan here , I own and am using three out of 4 models of the HP 12C series , and it is amusing and somewhat disappointing to observe that it had taken HP at least four years and two major upgrades of the HP 12c Platinium , in its futile attempt to `` fix & retire '' the HP12C with three successors in the form of HP12cPlatinum since 2004.It would seems especially frustrating on the part of HP , to realize after all the effort spent on remaking the HP12cPlatinum models that it would not outdone its siblings the HP10bII and HP17bII+ series to seriously challenge the HP12C Gold . However , by their own rights the HP10Bs and HP17Bs , and the HP12cPlatinum may find their rightful place in the HP financial calculator line , differentiating the HP12C GOLD in terms of price and functions.IMHO , this had happened because the following golden rules were infringed by HP ... GOLDEN RULE I - A PRODUCT WHICH STILL SELLS ITSELF IS NEVER OBSOLETE.GOLDEN RULE II - IF IT ARE N'T BROKEN , DON't FIX IT ! `` The gold rule of thumb should always be guarded as gospel by the HP heldheld calculator product team . Based on the same reasoning , the HP12C 's built quality and product standard is paramount to its users.GOLDEN RULE III - ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS ! If in doubt , see rules I & II.GOLDEN RULE IV - ONLY OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURING OF YOUR PRODUCT TO SOMEONE WHO COULD BETTER YOUR OWN PRODUCT QUALITY . If in doubt ask IBM about Lenovo.GOLDEN RULE V - THE BENCHMARKING INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE IS THE HP12C . Just in case , if HP does not know or is not listening to its customers.GOLDEN RULE VI - DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE ICONIC HP12C GOLD . HP needs no reminder that the customer is always right . Please let your customer , the ultimate market force decide if the HP12C should ever be retired.As an ardent fan of HP12C and line of financial business & scientific calculators , I am of the view that the day when HP discontinue the HP12C would be the day it exit this business segment . I speculate this would happen when the HP brandname disappears from the 12C just like after IBM name had disappeared from ThinkPads and ThinkCentres.Since the price of GOLD is on the rise , it is indeed puzzling to fans of the HP12C , why HP did not release a genuine HP12C gold 25th anniversary model for the fans to mark the occasion , if replacing the discontinuing the HP12C GOLD is the intention READ ALL GOLDEN RULES above.To be fair , the silver HP12c Platinum Anniversary is very nice and has spotted the `` retro '' silver look of the HP 11C , however , it is still not the GOLD standard . With HP missing this golden opportunity to mark the occasion , I would love to see and own a HP 12C engraved with 50th Anniversary logo , reckon that this would be the ultimate testimony for the HP12C and a milestone for its fans.Looking forward , a GOLD 50th anniversary HP12C Anniversary model would be very nice for the fans.For HP , this is a lucrative business proposition . By now , they would have realized that if they have any of its products which could hit a 50th year home run in 2031 , it would not be from its other product line-it would be this original HP12C GOLD standard bearer . So please treat the old workhorse with the upmost respect !	1
I 've started doing more finance stuff recently and went looking for a good time-value-of-money calculator . I was pleasantly surprised to find the HP12C was still available . I 've been using HP calculators for decades ( HP-45 , HP-15 and now an HP-32SII ) because of their great feel and long-lasting quality . However , it 's also true that the HP12C is probably the last relic of the great HP calculator legacy . It has 'Made In China ' stamped on the rear , but the keyboard feel seems much like my dear departed 15C . Hopefully it will have the same long-term durability.Why do I recommend this calculator ? * ) RPN . In my world , the purpose of a calculator is to solve fairly straightforward math exercises quickly . If you 're a college student and need speed and pictures and parenthesis , buy a graphing calculator . If you 're solving Black-Scholl 's option equations , fire up Excel or something on your desktop computer . But for straightforward punch-it-in calculator work , nothing beats RPN entry . * ) Fit and Finish . The keys have good tactile feedback . The display blinks on every entry . You just *know* you 've entered the data correctly . The purpose of a calculator is quick , accurate answers at your fingertips . If you do n't care about this , do n't waste money on this calculator ( or any high-end TI or Casio ) . Buy a $ 5 Walmart calculator . * ) Straightforward financial calculations . Sure , I could write a program for my HP 32SII to do financial calculations . But why , when I can just key in the data directly to the HP12C , push dedicated financial keys , and get immediate answers . This calculator has most of the financial functions you need in a calculator ( amortization , depreciation , NPV , date functions , etc . ) along with the basic complement of standard calculator functions ( ln , mean , standard deviation , factorial , etc ) . The complexity level is about right for a calculator . It does n't take a computer science degree to operate it like the graphing calculators require , and it 's far more capable than the $ 5 Walmart brands . * ) Speed . I see reviews complaining that this calculator is slow when doing things like IRR computations . They 're right . So what ? If your IRR computation is that complicated , use a spreadsheet . If you 're a college student taking exams , you 're better off with a graphing calculator anyway . For 99 % of the things the rest of us do with a calculator the 12C is more than fast enough , and the price of speed is power consumption . My 32SII is going on 10 years without a battery replacement , and I trust the 12C will have the same thrifty ways . It 's a pain to need a quick answer , reach for the calculator , and then find the batteries are exhausted . This was a regular occurence when I owned TI and Casio brands . I 've never had this problem with the HPs I 've owned.It also has some programming capabilities which some may find useful . Personally , I have n't used the programming mode in a calculator for many years . Almost invariably I find it easier to just pull up a spreadsheet or write some code.I suspect the under-30 crowd will find this calculator -- maybe the whole calculator premise -- feels 'dated ' , and in a way they 're right . However , if you 're one of those who , like me , use these tools every day and always want one nearby , I think you 'll like this calculator . For fit , finish , and a pleasant balance of performance with simplicity it seems to be on par with my earlier HP calculators . ( Time will tell , I suppose , whether or not it has the same durability . ) What is certain is that in the age of cellphones , PDAs and computers the era of high-quality long-lasting purpose-built calculators is going the way of the Dodo bird .	1
For simple calculations and discounted cash flows , this one is still the best . I used this in my graduate business program , and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive . Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet ; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation ( & # 34 ; RPN & # 34 ; ) , which is what this calculator uses , to be easy and intuitive . Many do ; some do n't . RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb . One of these lasted me decades . It got lost in an office move , so I am purchasing another . RJB .	1
While I do n't have an MBA , it 's hard to believe that a calculator I learned how to use in 1987 during undergraduate business courses is still the standard for the quick calculating financial world . Any finance professional over 30 will know how to use this , and in a pinch , you might need to know how to use it . I know the TI-8x series has financial functions and the graphic capabilities may make those calculators worthwhile . But for most financial pros , if it ca n't be done on an HP12C , then you probably need a computer.The RPN system is n't hard to learn ( at a basic level it works similar to an adding machine ) , and the functions on this calculator take input and spit out output in a way similar to Excel ( i.e . negative numbers for payments and positive for future value , etc. ) . I found mine the other day after not using it for a while and immediately used it for a discounted cash flow quick analysis I was later planning to do in Excel . It told me the on-the-fly answer I needed .	1
I 've had an HP 12C ever since they were first available , roughly twenty years ago . I 'm just in the process of buying another one , as my original one is finally and completely dead.If you 're in any business and have anything to do with money ( outside of being a cashier ) , this calculator is essential . It includes almost every financial function that you need , and quite a few that you probably do n't . Any problem involving the time value of money or finance is a snap with this mini-machine.The only potential problem that I can see for a new user is the RPN format ( By the way , RPN stands for Reverse Polish Notation . It was invented by a Polish mathematician , Jan Lukasiewicz for symbolic logic . ) RPN is different from the traditional method on entering equations into a calculator , but is easy to learn and use ... in fact , once you get used to it , the traditional way seems very clumsy . For die-hards , the HP 12C Platinum Edition includes both traditional and RPN entry methods and is the one that should be purchased .	1
Bought this for my boss because he lost his . He loves this calculator & would not be caught without it . It really helps him with his day to day work & he is the CEO of my company . If the CEO swears by them then they must be a great little calculator .	1
This is a well-designed , simple calculator that handles typical four-function math . Large , easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read . The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you do n't hit more than one at a time , and are nicely spaced . The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price . Excellent choice if you 're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you ca n't clear the memory unless you display it . That seems to be the way with all calculators today . A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number ( e.g. , has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory ) . That comes in handy at times .	1
I love this calculator , big numbers and calculate excellent so easy to use and make my life so much easier .	1
I 've had mine for 4 years now and use it almost daily . Never had any problems with it even after a few drops to the carpeted floor . Large easy to read keys with a nice feel , not too hard - not too soft . Large easy to read display . All in all , good calculator for everyday basic functions .	1
If you need a calculator that prints , this is not the calculator for you . However , if you need a handy sized , easy to read , solar calculator ... this is a good one . It does everything that I want a calculator to do at work . It can figure % . I never use these features , but it can figure tax rates and has memory ( mrc , m- , m+ ) . The buttons are big enough . I would buy this model again .	1
A great , basic calculator that does exactly what I need it to . It is a bit bigger than I 'd like , but I 've become used to it . I actually kind of like the bigger buttons now . I also like that it has a no-slide bottom ( i.e. , it stays in place when I am punching numbers at the table ) . Overall , a great purchase !	1
Texas Instruments makes an excellent , relatively basic calculator with all the functions I need . The unit is sturdy ; this is well made.In addition to solid construction , there are quite a few calculator functions that should suffice unless you need a scientific calculator or another more advanced model . The keys are good sized ; and this makes using them to calculate things very easy . You can expect this product to reliably add , subtract , multiply and divide numbers ; and you get square root , percentage , a change sign key ( to change from a negative number to a positive number ) , and three memory function keys as well . Great ! I also like that the display uses commas when necessary.There are three more function keys at the top of the buttons that read `` ( rate , tax+ , tax- ) ; '' they are for calculating tax rates.Although this is a solar powered calculator ( you can also use it under a light ) , it can be used with batteries as an option . There is a battery compartment on the back of the calculator but rest assured you do n't need to use it ; solar power or using this on a desk with a lamp will make a battery unnecessary.Overall , this is an excellent little calculator without the bells and whistles I just do n't need . I highly recommend this item .	1
This review is for the SECOND version of this calculator , the slightly-larger , grey , BLACK and white model , with a rounded `` mound '' housing the keypad . I had actually ordered the older model -- the light-grey model , with the blue and white keys , slightly smaller , which I had had previously , but sadly lost . I had considered returning this newer model , but finally decided against it , as it is now listed as being discontinued by the manufacturer , so -- if I returned the newer one I did get , I very well might have gotten the same model back ... ... ... .I was , at first , extremely disappointed in the newer model . ( Why both the newer model and the older model -- which look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- have the VERY SAME MODEL NUMBER is completely beyond me . I mean , people who work at Texas Instruments are supposed to be very intelligent and know what they are doing ... .but why they decided to give to truly different calculators the same model number is something I do n't think I 'll ever understand . I mean ... what kind of `` genuis '' makes this very simple mistake ? ( one who wants to fool online and catalogue buyers , who have to trust that the packers will pack the right model , perhaps > ) That said , this NEWER model -- though larger and more-than-slightly bulkier than the older one -- does have a few advantages ... .I think.I do n't remember the older model having a `` tax+ '' or `` tax- '' or `` rate '' key , nor do I remember it having a battery backup , as the newer model does.This newer model has a nice little compartment for the battery , which need only be opened with a single screw . So , the entire back of the calculator need not be taken off -- with the slight dangers , therein , of getting dust into the machine , or disturbing the delicate circuitry , in the half a minute or so , that it takes to change the battery . With a neat little separate oompartment for the battery changing , the rest of the back of the machine need not be disturbed at all ! This is all the more important , as more and more calculators , sadly , are made with `` no user-replaceable batteries '' enclosed , ( no -- one is instructed , in these other , still newer calculators , to take them to the nearest authorized repair shop , of the designated manufacturer -- and have them replaced there , like wrist-watch batteries ! First wrist-watches , now calculators ! Talk about planned obsolence ! ( Buy even this newer model 1795SV , and keep it close ! ) Although the newer model 1795sv has a `` wrap-around , windshield '' numberical display , ( instead of what is to me , the far more esthetically pleasing and clearer , `` picture-frame '' numberical display , found in the older model 1795sv ) , the numbers still are well-spaced and clear to view . It also has the nice , l a r g e numberic display , which is not only on this newer model 1795SV , but also on the older model 1795SV ... ..and also on the belated , dearly loved , and sadly lost original Texas Instrument `` 1795 '' model , ( no `` sv '' ) , which I once had , and enjoyed more than both of the `` 1795sv '' models put together ! ( It was small , handy , and a beautiful medium-bone-yellow in colour . It also seemed to stay on FOREVER -- pr at least an hour or so , if I remember correctly . Oh , that Texas Instruments would bring THAT model back , sigh ! ) Well , this NEW m0del 1795SV -- though NOT the older , handier model 1795SV , nor the original model 1795 -- still has many good points , most of which are delineated above . It is also a desk-top model which can be carried in a pocket-book , if necessary -- and also in a briefcase , but not in a wallet . It is bigger than the two previous models in the Texas Instrument 1795 line ... but does have that priceless customer-replacable battery chamber . Although I do prefer the previous two models , this newer one , now available , is not a bad little calculator , all things considered.But I would still welcome , ( greatly ! ) , the return of the original 1795 model , and/or the original 1795sv .	1
This is a well built calculator that has large keys for folks with large fingers . I would recommend if you have larger hands . Ended up purchasing several for my company due to their popularity . Best large keyed calculator under $ 15 .	1
Texas Instruments Solar Calculater . This is a neat calculator and soent take up a ton of space on your desk . The numbers are large enough to see . And has never given me a false answer or calculation like other ones I have had.It has a solart cell so you do not have to be concerned with battery failure . As your desl lamp or outside window light will keep it charged for you . Large led numbers are easy to read if your eye sight is not what it used to be.Purchased here on Amazon.com Where the whole World . Shops for Value .	1
I did n't take math my senior year of high school and did n't know where my calculator was when I started college . I bought this one because it was cheap , compared to the TI 83 that I wanted . I used it for 2 years before it was damaged ( my fault , not a product defect ) .I bought a cheap calculator to replace it and have been very disappointed . I plan on getting another calculator like these before my statistics class next semester .	1
This is a good calculator , does what it is supposed to , great color , easy to take on the road when I travel .	1
Amazon is totally my school supply go to place . They may not have the colors I want , but they ALWAYS have the price ! 3rd calculator I 've ordered here . Just like what you buy at the store ( and usually less expensive )	1
This calculator does the job for what I need . No batteries needed and it is solar powered . Only problem I have is the cover case . It is not slide in / slide out cover cases like most calculators . It is more of a snap it on / snap it off . Other than that it does help protect it from dust and getting the screen scratched .	1
Outside of being able to attach this to your car 's rim and use it as a tire , this calculator does about everything . And , for a reasonable price ! This is the required calculator for the 6th grade here in Ohio , but I originally purchased mine for an advanced chemistry class for a top 10 university course 18 years ago . It 's still the one I grab every time I need a calculator - it performs all the scientific notation that I need , and does n't become cumbersome like the TI-83 . I 've used this for everything from calculus , microbiology , biochemistry to advanced chemistry and it 's worked like a dream . For the price , it just can not be beat and durability , well that speaks for itself . Highly , highly recommend !	1
This TI scientific calculator was easy to use instantly . Clearly written and thorough instructions that made it simple to operate . I have n't had use for all of the functions , and probably never will , but for high school and college , this will do very nicely .	1
This is a very nice calculator for high school students in higher math - algebra , trig , pre-calculus . The two line display is an added bonus . Ca n't beat the price for the functionality .	1
I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise . Apparently , they only carry this in black . URGH ! ! ! I LOVE that it comes in pink . ( Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it . Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership , not that I 'm plugging Amazon , but I love Amazon . ) I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries . That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer does n't have the numeric keys , so it 's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard , and it 's also time consuming . I love this calculator - very useful .	1
When working properly , these are wonderful calculators : affordable , simple to learn , fuctional , small , comes with case , easy to reset the memory , etc.It 's not as bulky or expensive as something like the TI-89 and on series of graphing calculators.I recommend these calculators for all my chemistry classes . I 've never had to use the sin , cos , and tan buttons , but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation ( end , sci/eng , right , enter ) . It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once , you 'll be fine.Occasionally , there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little . In that case , you have to be extra careful when inputting data , but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion : Good choice for science class .	1
Like others have posted this is not as pictured . The design is not the floral or the geometric as the two pictured . The design part in these pictures is all white on the calculator I received . If this is a big deal to you , you may want to go to a store where you can pick the design you want . For me the pink color met my requirements.A great basic non graphing scientific calculator at a great price . My school bookstore charges $ 20 for these and only has them in black . Pink makes it stand out so you know it is yours and makes doing math more fun ! It is solar powered with a battery back up . It has a cover that snaps on the back when you dont need it shut , and there is a cheat sheet for the functions that is in the cover . I love Texas Instruments , they make products meant to last . This is a nice quality plastic making it very durable and last a life time. Can not beat the price , and Prime 2 day free shipping . Always looking to save a buck .	1
I used this calculator throughout college and it served me well . For all your non-graphing calculator needs this is the calculator for you . It has all the necessary functions and many more that I never used . Overall solid buy and it has lasted me well over 5 years without any issues .	1
Unless your instructor requires you for having high class graphic calculator that you can see entire graph on the screen , this calculator does good job through lower calc class . I got this a bit over $ 10 at Wal-Mart , and it 's been lasting 3+ years now . No issues or no problem whatsoever .	1
Thankfully amazon had a great supply of scientific calculators , since sadly I had never heard of them until I received my daughter 's supply list for middle school . Exactly what she needs for math . Powered by solar so you never need batteries . Cool color ... enough said .	1
Main Points : I used this calculator for over 10 years before it finally stopped working , and I treated it fairly roughly ( e.g. , coffe spills ) . I think others here have attested to the functionality of the TI-30 , so I just want to emphasize that it 's a tough little gadget as well . Yes , the buttons are on the small side and there is a bit of play , but this was never a major problem ( although at times it slows down data entry ) . You can go to [ ... ] for a good overview of TI calculators , and you can scope out one of TI 's major competitors at [ ... ] A Little History : This was also one of the first commercially available low-priced calculators that had two-line display and backspace to correct or edit data entry . The dual-power and scrolling display features were also once unusual . The top line ( for data entry ) shows up to 11 characters ; you can scroll backwards or forwards up to 88 ! The bottom line ( shows results ) displays up to a 10-digit answer along with a 2-digit exponent.Individual Needs Differ : From the reviews here , it appears that high school math is now more difficult than it once was . If you know that you 're going to need graphing capability , then obviously this is not the choice for you . Similarly , the prevalence of laptop computers and math/stats software may obviate the need for some of the more advanced features.Recommendation : The layout is very good and , for such a low price , it packs a lot of calculating might . However , high school ( or college ) students may want to narrow their choices and then ask their teacher which one has the most relevant functions for the next few years of math . Compared to twenty-five or so years ago , one can now get a lot more calculator for the money . Depending on your budget , therefore , you might determine that a calculator like this is sufficient for your short-term needs , but that you 'll need a new one if you go on to more advanced stats and math . In any event , this is a durable calculator that works very well .	1
I looked everywhere for a calculator that would help with my son 's Geometry . This seemed to fit the bill . Nice size display and a nice instruction guide . I 'm sure he 'll be using this ALOT .	1
I purchased this calculator after the first one I bought for her , this one : Texas Instruments Inc. TI-84 Plus Silver Edition Blue Graphing Calculator ( Packaging may vary ) was rejected by my sister 's math teacher as being too complex for a basic algebra class . The teacher approved of this one , and my sister was able to use it successfully in her math class .	1
This is an item that does what it says it does . Comes in good shape and works well . What more can I say ?	1
This is a great item for basic scientific calculations . It does not do all the functions of the somewhat higher models in the product line but meets my needs just right . And a great bargain at less than $ 13 .	1
I have two teenagers going to the local community college and my wife just started college too . We had my old TI-30X scientific from when I went for my MBA so we ordered two more of he TI-30X which is the updated version of the same calculator I had . Ca n't beat the price and color selection .	1
Have been using this for a college math class . Does everything I need it to , and a lot more that I have not figured out yet .	1
This is a pricey but versatile calculator . Yes , there are better , more advanced calculators out there for the advanced mathematics and scientific user . And yes , this item should be priced much lower than it is , considering it has been on the market for a long time . However , for use in an academic setting , consider that there exists a lot of teaching materials out there in the classrooms , as well as activities , that are built around this model . So , because of that , this model has survived all this time.I bought this calculator to use in a Corporate Finance class . Calculating Time Value of Money problems with this was much easier than using the BA II Plus . The inputs are easier to enter , without having to memorize long sequences of key strokes.Your instructor and the class activities will most likely dictate which brand and model of calculator to purchase , rather than a reviewer 's recommendations . However , one bit of advice I can give you is very important to remember : Please , use regular 1.5v alkaline batteries should you purchase this model . The rechargeable batteries , with their 1.2v , will not be enough to give you a clear display . A set of four batteries will last a very long time . However , it would not be a bad idea to carry a spare pack of 4 in your briefcase or backpack . You would not want to run out of battery in the middle of an important exam . This calculator , unlike the more basic models , will not run on solar power .	1
One of these calculators is probably one of the most useful things you can have in high school , especially if you are taking classes such as algebra 2 , geometry , physics , pre-calculus , or calculus . No matter what you will always find yourself using one of these calculators in high school , they are very powerful calculators that have a great advantage over a standard calculator because it has the ability to have programs on it and because it is a graphing calculator . These calculators can even be used during tests such as the SAT ! It gives you a better advantage if you know how to use one of these well . The only downside to these calculators is that they require 4 AAA batteries , they last a pretty long time though because the screen does n't take up much power . Some people might complain that the screen is too low resolution to today 's standards or that it is n't a backlit screen , but this screen is what allows for greater battery use , you would n't want your calculator to power off during an exam . So although this calculator is from 1999 it is still a good calculator that you wo n't regret getting.I rate the TI-83 Plus 5 out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out !	1
Math is not my best subject and this calculator is perfect . I highly recomend it for students from high school on .	1
Worked exactly as described . Did n't love statistics , but the calculator sure made the class a lot easier . Would recommend this !	1
Product arrived in the condition and of a quality that I expected . It is a standard black color and functions as expected .	1
classic TI-83 . it 's back - or at least never left . the price is still up there , but let 's not get into that . works beautifully and calls back memories of calculus class back in high school . easy to use , great features .	1
Bottom-Line : The Texas Instruments `` TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator '' is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career , it is just that powerful.It 's time for me to head back to school , DeVry University 's Keller Graduate School of Management that is . This time I am in pursuit of my MBA with a concentration in Networking and Telecommunications . Why pursue a boring ole traditional MBA when new technology is to be learned ? So that means math ; lots of math ; loads of math in the form of algebra , calculus , and the ever dread statistics.Did I mention that I hate math ! ? What does one do when one hates math , but still needs to do it in spades ? Buy a calculator of course , but not just any calculator I needed a calculator cable of doing complex mathematics including graphing equations . My very first course called for a Texas Instruments `` TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator . `` Powered by ( 4 ) AAA-sized batteries ( plus 1 CR-1616 or CR 1620 lithium battery for backup ) , the `` TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator '' is large unit ideal for advanced mathematics students high school algebra to college-level calculus , and statistics . The TI-83 Plus packs a lot of mathematical punch and the price of $ 127.00 ( Office Depot.com ) certainly confirms it.The TI-83 Plus calculator combines features for statistical analysis , engineering , trigonometric and financial functions making it ideal for a student seeking an MBA . Financial functions include TVM , cash flows and amortization , though surprisingly a percentage key is missing from the calculator.The two pound ( yes , it is heavy , kind of ) TI-83 Plus features a non-backlit 64x96 pixel grey scale LCD screen that is frankly hard to read unless the lighting is exactly right . But the LCD display can display graphs and tables on a full as well as split-screen . And the display exhibits up to ( 12 ) characters and eight lines . The calculator can graph/trace equations while scrolling through table values . And the TI-83 Plus can store and analyze up to 10 equations.I also purchased the optional TI-Graph Link ( software and USB cable ) . The software and cable allows one to connect the TI-83 Plus to a computer via a USB port permitting the transfer of files and data between the two devices.My ThoughtsAmple time should be given to learning what the TI-83 Plus can bring to the table . All of the nine digits are there of course , but the face of the calculator contains a whole lot more in the form of multi-colored special function buttons ; and there are a lot of them ! However , the TI-83 Plus ships with very detailed , instruction manual , so I plan to carry it with me at all times.As I stated above , and it is worth restating , the TI-83 Plus 's non-backlit LCD is a little difficult to read when the unit is lying flat on a desk and a lot will depend on the lighting conditions . Even with the right lighting , the top line of the display is hard to read.Though I was stunned by the high price of the unit the `` Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator '' is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career , it is just that powerful . You can buy it for a high school student and ( s ) he can use it through graduate school .	1
I purchase these cards frequently to make my own birthday , Christmas and other holiday greetings . This is the best price I have ever paid for them and they arrived quickly . The cards themselves are of high quality and help me create a final product I can be proud of .	1
This is a really good , high-quality product . It saves money because you can do it yourself . It also saves time and gas - instead of going to the store , you can just do it yourself.High quality product - very highly recommended.Not very many people nowadays still write paper letters . But , believe it or not , I still have a few people that I still correspond with on paper and snail mail . I do prefer snail mail rather than any other way . This is a good way to have some stationery in which to write a letter on .	1
no , you wo n't fool anyone into thinking that these are commercial-quality cards , but they 're pretty good . i prefer the matte finish over glossy which tend to have even flimsier paper . the size of these cards are basically a piece of 8.5 '' x11 '' paper folded in half , so that makes these larger than a normal commercial greeting card . but since they 're `` regular paper-sized , '' it 's easy to design your own elements and print without worrying about sizing , orientation , etc ... this is fine for casual card-making . despite using your printer 's ink , it 's still cheaper than buying greeting cards . it 's a good option for a home hobbyist or for making last-minute cards if you do n't feel like going to the store .	1
I like the larger size and the very whiteness of the paper . The matte paper really takes in a lot of the inks so the result is sometimes stunning . I only mark it down one star because I wish it were just a bit stiffer .	1
I love making my own greeting cards . These work perfectly with my canon inkjet printer.I like to take tons of pictures at parties and get togethers . It is amazing how many funny looking faces some people make while trying to smile for a photo especially a big group . There will always be one in the middle of doing something else instead of getting the smile right . I like to take and isolate that one and later for their birthday or something make a funny card . Or put funny sayings in word balloons over their heads and make a funny card.People like personalized cards and not only that , this is so much cheaper than cookie cutter cards at the store . My friends all seem to look forward to my cards so I use lots of these Avery Half Fold products .	1
Sometimes I want to create an especially personal card for someone and these half fold cards and envelopes make for a very nice end product . There is a finish to one side that helps make the printed graphics look better than if the paper were not coated .	1
The weight of this card stock is perfect for my ink jet printer and feeds smoothly . The fold line is so slight that you can use the page whole if you want and not fold it at all . It also lends itself to being cut in half for single page note cards . I 've already made three sets featuring original art for Christmas presents.I 've tried three other brands of half-fold card stock and all have been too heavy to feed smoothly through my printer . The resulting cards show lines of print instead of a smooth picture -- not exactly professional quality . This product is perfect . It 's a good weight for a greeting card or note card and has a smooth bright white finish . It can be folded into a half fold card via the scored line as designed , but does n't have to be and the faint line is n't obvious if the page is left whole for a printed notice where you want some heft , like for a yard sale or lost pet . If you cut the cards in half for note cards and miss the scored line by a tiny amount , it does n't show so your note cards still look perfect.I will definitely buy more of these cards . Highly recommended .	1
I 'm a digital photography enthusiast and this product has given me the ability to make stunning personalized cards for family and friends . Very easy to use straight out of the box . These cards reproduce photographs very nicely , in bright , vibrant color.The half-fold is nice as it gives you plenty of room for artwork and personalized messages on the inside . Highly recommended .	1
I created a whole group of Christmas cards with these . They look great and were fun to do . I 'm ordering more so I can finish my card list .	1
This product consists of decent quality 8.5 x 11 matte card stock with a partial laser perforation in the middle so the it folds in half evenly . 25 envelopes are included in the package . This is larger than a typical greeting card , but the size makes it easy to use with just about any printer . The paper accepts and absorbs the ink without seeping through or veining in the paper fibers . The paper color is not bright white , but is appropriate for a greeting card.The package insert , dated 2007 , states that Avery DesignPro software is Windows only . However , Avery DesignPro for Mac OSX is now available as a free download on the Avery.com software page . Avery DesignPro for Mac is a basic graphic design and layout program which includes templates for most Avery products , including Avery/American Greetings Half Fold Blank Cards ( 3265 ) . This is the easiest way I know of to use this kind of product . In addition , Avery DesignPro includes a printer calibration feature . Absolute precision is not so critical on greeting cards , but if you 're printing 90-per-page return address labels , a fraction of an inch one way or the other can run a whole sheet of labels.My printer ( an HP 7180 ) has a duplex ( two-sided printing ) attachment . The DesignPro software will print both sides on the same job . The trick is to choose Short-edge Binding in the print dialog box . If you choose long-edge , the inside of the card will print upside down on the wrong page . The preview in the print dialog box does not show the inside page , but it does print . If your printer does not have a duplex attachment , then you simply print page 1 only , flip the paper over and then print page 2 only . I 'd suggest trying this once or twice with plain paper , so you know exactly how to flip the paper for your particular printer.To me , these products fall in the etiquette scale between a hand-written note on your personal letterhead and a greeting card you bought in the grocery store . They do show you put some time and effort into the communication .	1
These are nice sturdy cards and envelopes that print up very nice and crisp . They are not photo cards but a slightly shiny card stock , they fold so easily on the fold mark , fit the envelopes nicely and no extra postage required . I used microsoft digital image suite to make my cards and it works perfectly with these , I used pictures of my pets to make Christmas cards and they turned out rather nice . These are not fancy cards but are nice enough to send out to others .	1
I have been using this Avery half-fold greeting card stock for more than ten years . I have tried other vendors and generic alternatives , but I have always gone back to Avery because of the print quality that you get from this product.On both sides of the greeting card , the printed output is smooth , crisp and sharp , yielding nice images . There is no bleeding of the inkjet colors into the fibers of the paper . The greeting card has a matt-coated finish on one side for the nice reproduction of pictures and images . The card has a slight crease for easy folding . I use Printshop for making cards , so I have never tried the free templates and software .	1
I 'm usually dissapointed in card makers but these are the best I have every used . The paper looks much better right out of the box , works great in the printer , does not smear and most important gives you a photo-like image on the paper.They are a nice big size and come with their own envelopes ( which is good since they are so big ) . The images are really as good as premium photo paper when compared side by side . They fold well , envelopes are good quality also.These might cost a little more than generic ones but well worth the price , can not find one bad thing to say about them .	1
I usually use Hallmark 's greeting card paper and like it a lot . Avery 's product is equally good . It is a true matte finish , so if you want a little more shine , this is n't for you . The stock is thick enough that the printing does n't show through and the fold is neat and professional . No need to buy pre made cards if you have these on hand . I use American Greeting 's printable option a lot but my kids like to make their own cards with it . They look much better than trying to fold your own card stock . I would highly recommend these .	1
My wife enjoys the creative process and personal touch of making/designing her own Special Occasion cards for family and friends . The package of Avery white half-fold greeting cards containing 20 each of card stock and envelopes , is perfect for this endeavor . The best feature of the card is the well-defined fold line , which helps when determining what side is the best or correct side , for the front of the card . The quality and sturdiness of the card stock is a big plus . It is a good weight ... not heavy , but not too light , either ! The paper accepts all the colored inks well , with the printing and pictures clear and clean-looking . The designs can slightly show through if printed on both sides , but that is not a big distraction . She will definitely order this product again .	1
I love this card stock . Nice weight , nice white tone , and the ink-jet prints on it are superior . They make it easy .	1
I like this brand of card stock - nice weight ; ink absorbs evenly , and the paper is scored , making folding the paper into a card easy and precise .	1
This is nice thick card stock that does not bleed through . I used these for invitations and printed a full color picture on front , black & white print with a color image inside and a color image on the back . They looked fantastic ! Of course I did need to keep the pages separated for a minute , so the ink could dry , but nothing smeared and they looked fabulous . The only trouble I had was that I could n't find an option for this Avery size in my Word 7 , so I used what I thought was closest to that size and it worked just fine ( and that is why I did n't give it 5 stars ) . I would definitely purchase these again !	1
this Avery greeting card paper works great for me . I never had it jam up my printer maybe its because I separate all the pages first to see if any are stuck together . then re-stack how may I want to print put paper in printer and print away . my cards turn out very well I will buy this paper again .	1
I found the cards to be simple to load , and the card stock itself is firm and easy to handle . I like these larger cards for relatives whose vision is n't great . The background is crisp and white and takes color well , whether text , clip art , or photos . There is a heavy-weight version of this product , but I do n't see the point in making greeting cards that last 100 years ...	1
Perfect cardstock for creating my own greeting cards on my inkjet printer . I used the templates for Microsoft Word , and they fed nicely into my Canon MP830 . Totally satisfied and will use this for future cards .	1
Avery and American Greetings have gotten together to create a product that will be giving your local card store a run for its money.Got a PC ? A color printer ? Like to collect clip art ? Or are you an amature photographer ? Well , combine that with a simple program ( like Microsoft 's PUBLISHER ) and you will be churning out unique , one-of-a-kind cards in a matter of minutes.The great part is , all the cards reflect you and your style . No longer do you have to contend with searching for `` the perfect card '' when you can create it ( and personalize it ) at home.I take photos and importing them on the Half Fold Blank Cards is a snap . You can add a greeting ( no more `` Happy Birthday '' but you can add the person 's name as well ) and you really are showing somebody how much you care ( Sorry Hallmark , I could n't resist the jab ) .This product produces professional cards that are just as good ( sometimes better ) than the ones you buy in the card stores.Avery/ American Greetings provide you with envelopes so all you need is a little talent and wait until you see the end product !	1
These cards are made of pretty good card stock with nice envelopes . The template I downloaded did not have any envelope printing option ; there was only a template for the card . Designing the card took a little bit of experimenting before I got the writing and picture to be organized correctly in the template . There are really no guides in the template . It also took me a while to orient the paper correctly in the printer , but once that worked , the output of the picture on the card cover was rich.This is for inkjet printers only and before I selected this product , I had missed that description . I did try it in my laser printer with the duplex option set and the card stock got jammed as expected . However , it did print the front of the card beautifully before that happened . I then printed a saying on regular paper and glued it to the back of the card . Obviously , if you have an inkjet printer , you wo n't have to do this . Instead , I had my friend use this product on her inkjet printer . Below is her review : '' The paper has the perfect weight for card stock . The paper fed through my printer with ease each time ( not too thick ) , and it worked well for double sided printing with no bleed through . Both black and color ink printed perfectly . I would purchase this brand card stock paper again . `` In summary , if you like printing your own cards and have an inkjet printer , then this Avery product is a good option .	1
If you want to send a largish greeting card with plenty of room for photos or images , this is just what you need . So many of the print your own card kits produce small cards . These are grate for photos - big enough so you can notice them across the room and be drawn to see them better .	1
I tried printing photo greeting cards on this paper with two different printers - an Epson Artisan 810 and an HP OfficeJet 6500A - and had a very positive experience with both . In the past , I have had greeting card papers jam or refuse to feed unless the paper goes in from the top , but I had no difficulties with either printer in this case . The colors were a bit richer coming from the Epson printer , and I 'm sure it 's because that printer utilizes six ink cartridges and is designed more specifically for photo printing . However , the results were very close , and I was very happy with the prints from both machines . Colors are bright and clear , and the details are sharp . The cards have a nice feel to them and the scoring in the middle of the sheets make them very easy to fold cleanly and evenly . With the matte finish , the ink is dry and okay to handle as soon as the prints come out of the printer . I 'm very happy with this paper and would buy it again for gifts and my own personal use .	1
This is a great size for a holiday letter card where you can print a photo on the cover and your letter on the inside , works easier if your printer does doublesided automatically .	1
Ever have a day when you need a card and you do n't have one on hand ? Avery White Half-Fold Greeting Cards are nice to have to quickly and easily create a nice looking card . The paper is sturdier and nicer looking than normal printer paper . I think at a half page size , they are a little big and the envelopes are a little cheap looking . My huge recommendation is to always print your card on a piece of normal paper to make sure it is right before using this paper . Since I messed one up , I printed a half page size card . I like that size better , but then you need to have your own envelopes or do without . Making two per page would make the cards more economical , too . It is very easy to find pre-made designs that fit this template size . Even a beginner could make a card in minutes . I used a non-color laser printer and by choosing a black and white design , the cards look great . Overall , I like these and if they save a trip to the store ... I love them .	1
This Half-Fold style along with Avery 's Quarter Fold heavy paper stock is the perfect medium to use for those who prefer to send personalized greeting cards . Sure , you can use standard printer paper , but these scored sheets are whiter , brighter and make the colors and text pop , and it gives your cards ( that you worked long and hard on ) that professional look . These packages all come with matching envelopes which make it a great deal . I do n't go out and spend $ 5-6.00 PER CARD for those generic cards you get at drug stores anymore ... ... . that 's ridiculous . I love designing and personalizing the cards I send out at a fraction of the cost .	1
I had some less-expensive half-fold cards that I had purchased previously . I assumed that the same card ( same pictures , words and fonts ) would look about the same on them both . After all , they were both Avery products . To test my theory , I test-printed the same thing ( using the same fonts and the same picture ) on both cards . I was amazed at the difference ! The words were sharper and clearer on these cards . However , where they really stood out was the clarity of the picture ! The picture on the other card was acceptable -- until I put them side-by-side for comparison ! On this card , the colors were more vivid , and the picture was a lot sharper . In fact , when compared to this card-stock , the picture on the less expensive paper looked faded and washed out ( something I probably would 've never noticed if I had n't seen the side-by-side comparison ) . I 'm still having a hard time believing that different card-stock can make such a diffence . The difference really is that noticeable . These more expensive half fold cards are definitely worth the extra expense , and I will buy them in the future.I also like that you can download free templates from [ & # 8230 ; ] templates ( something that is true of all Avery products ) . When using Avery 's free templates , you have four options:1 - Avery Templates ( a simple and basic download , and it works with MS Word & Adobe programs ) ; 2 - Avery Wizard for MS Office ( a download that gives more options than the basic option and makes MS Word even easier to use ) ; 3 - Avery Design & Print Online ( Online version that does not require a download , unfortunately I could n't figure out how to do single labels without printing an entire page of the same label ) ; 4 - Avery DesignPro ( a download that allows even more features than basic or MS Office templates . All the templates are free , and you can use them with multiple Avery products ( labels , gift cards , etc . )	1
I used this cardstock to make Christmas tags for my son 's preschool goodie bags and I had no problems printing them on an inkjet printer . I also used these cards and Avery 's DesignPro software to print Christmas cards and they looked like something I could have bought at the store . I was really impressed with the papers and would definitely use them again as well as recommend them to others .	1
The avery Half-Fold Greeting Cards for Inkjet Printers are great for Greeting Cards and Invitations . I have made Invitatons and Greeting Cards with ease using this kit . You can easly download Avery Templates and Software to help you make beautiful cards everyone will enjoy receiving .	1
The paper quality is good , and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site . The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards , to office-oriented announcement cards . You have to provide the actual text ; but the background images are part of the templates . You can also design and print your cards via their web site ; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time . Helpful instructions are close by . The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word ; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software .	1
This is a nice heavy weight cardsotck . It is not of exceptional quality - pretty much the basic cardstock paper you can find in big packages at the local craft or discount store . It works well for run-of-the-mill cards like larger quantities of Christmas cards , but I prefer to use a better quality for special cards . Still , it works well for its price .	1
The cards and envelopes are a good quality paper and have a nice feel to them . I like to use my own photos designs for cards and these will be perfect for Christmas this year .	1
I 've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great . Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant . I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded . This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint , which is minor , is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier . Other than that , I 'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up .	1
This is a really nice card making kit . The card stock is very heavy and a nice texture . It 's easy to format and includes envelopes . I do think the large envelopes would need extra postage if you are mailing them .	1
The kids and I had a blast making cards last month for Christmas and Thank You 's . The cards printed out beautifully and saved us a trip to the card shop ( and some big $ $ $ spent there usually ) . I am going to keep these in stock at home for our card needs . A+	1
Have used this many times before and this site had one of the best prices . Crisp colors and quality paper	1
It 's been a while since I 've used actual greeting card paper to make my photo greeting cards . The first time I made greeting cards on a PC , I used HP greeting card paper , which I found on clearance . I loved making photo cards ! Unfortunately , I realized greeting card paper was a bit costly when not on clearance , so I turned to other paper for my cards . Mostly , I have made them onCanon Matte Photo Paper , 8.5 x 11 Inches , 50 Sheets ( 7981A004 ) . ( Note , however , I have not bought this paper since 2005 , when I stocked up on it , because it was so cheap . Thus , I do n't know if Canon has changed anything about the paper or not . The box itself looks different . ) It is basically inexpensive photo paper , and has no Canon name on the reverse side , so you can print your greetings on that side . ( Just make certain you print the photo on the right side . If not , it will look horrendous , whereas words look just fine . Hold the paper up to a lamp to find the brightest white side for the photo . ) It also folds relatively easily . If you want your card on glossy paper , use glossy photo paper for your photograph , pastel or bright bonded paper for your message , and tape or paste the bonded paper to the back of the glossy paper . ( All glossy paper I have ever seen has the brand 's name on the back , so messages ca n't be printed there . ) Then , just get a box of envelopes that fit your cards , such asColumbian CO468 Grip-Seal Invitation Envelopes A9 , 5-3/4 '' x 8-3/4 '' - White ( Box of 100 ) .If you want it quick and easy , though , do get these Avery greeting cards . The envelopes are included , and the card paper is already half folded , so there 's no struggle in getting the card folded just right . The photos I printed on these cards looked almost as good as the photos printed on matte photo paper . I used 10 of these Avery cards to make a stationery set for friends . I printed photos of their dogs on the front of the cards , and left the insides blank for `` newsy '' notes . Since the envelopes in this pack come bounded in two sets of ten , that worked out quite well . I included one of the envelope sets with the cards , and had a very nice Christmas gift for my friends . I do n't think the included envelopes are quite as nice as the Columbian ones , but they certainly will do . Also , when making a quarter card , while folding the half card in half , the card tore in half ! So , you might want to watch out for that , or get quarter card paper for your smaller cards . Making greeting cards on the computer is lots of fun , and Avery makes it simple with these half-fold greeting cards !	1
I am on my third pack of Avery half-fold cards in only about a year 's time . I love this product ! Aside from the typical print-out greeting cards , I use the cardstock for a couple of other things as well : ( 1 ) They 're scored deeply enough that they rip in half easily . Once ripped in half , I cut along the line to make it look neater , fold each half of cardstock in half , and then make two handmade cards out of one sheet . ( 2 ) The cardstock works really well as a cover when creating half-fold booklet projects.One thing that 's different about this product from others is that it comes with envelopes . Plenty of other brands only sell cardstock in packs , and this envelope size is n't always easy to find . The printing is also less likely to smear than some other types of heavy paper since the surface is n't glossy.The only negative I have to say is that this packet used to come with 25 cards and envelopes ( my old box reads : `` 5 more cards ! Now with 25 cards. '' ) . I really wish Avery had kept the pack at a larger size and not taken it back down to 20 . The actual product is great , though , and something I use frequently .	1
These cards allow us to make beautiful , personalized custom cards at a fraction of what we 'd pay for those overpriced , impersonal store-bought ones . I can have 25 hand drawn Avery cards for less than the price of one fancy store-bought one , or if I print them , including ink , it would still be less than $ 1/card.The kids used the Avery cards for the first time today , making some cards for a friend 's birthday . They came out looking so nice and polished . We did n't even bother with the printer ; they just drew right on them . They will have even more fun when we 've got more time to experiment , with glitter , buttons , stickers , cut outs , etc . I 'm looking forward to scanning in some of their favorite drawings and using them for cover art . Or making a Father 's Day card with a photo of the kids and their dad . I think I 'll make a birthday card for my dad from his dog , with a picture of his dog on the cover and googly eyes pasted on.The card stock is nice and heavy , is a nice bright white that shows true colors , and is scored for easy folding . The folds come out crisp but not at all flimsy.Knowing Avery products as I do , I 'm sure they will work like a dream in my printer , but I will update my review when I have an opportunity to do a card on the printer .	1
These greeting cards worked really good . I was looking for a card size more like the ones you buy in the store but these were inexpensive and you get 20 of them . Good deal . I Payed the price I would pay for one Hallmark card and got 20 of them . This is fun for the whole family both making and receiving them .	1
Great card stock , excellent paper and it worked great with my inkjet printer . I chose cute Christmas card design , my photo and my personal message and was done in minutes ! But ... I did n't like starting with just blank cards . For advanced users I 'm sure it 's what everybody wants , blank slate so their imagination runs wild . But I wanted to at least start with some color and pre-printed borders , so all I would need to pick is my pictures and write my message . Overall , still 5 out of 5 .	1
Great bang for the buck . Buy it , and I promise you will not be disappointed .	1
This is a good calculator for those who are taking business classes . This is helpful for those taking introductory courses in Accounting and also in Finance . You can also use this to check your Excel spreadsheet and make sure that your formulas are correct . This can be especially helpful when setting up an amortization table . However , if your teacher will allow it , you may be better off with a graphing calculator , like a Ti-83 . You can use the Ti-83 's TVM functions to do the same things , and it is a little bit easier to learn.Another thing to consider , for those who will be taking exams , is that you will need to master the functions of whatever model calculator will be allowed on the test . While I prefer the TI-83 , it may not be allowed in the CPA Exam , for example .	1
I bought the calculator for Accounting classes , and now it is just laying there not used . But it is good enough for the first Accounting classes , then you do better upgrade your calculator .	1
I got this calculator at request from my Corporate Finance professor.Its the student version and pretty easy to use -- key thing being that you regularly clear your work from memory in between TVM problems.Once you get the hang of it , its very fast to calculate PV , NPV , FV , Cost of Capital , etc.Its not as solidly made as the TI-85 's I had in Calc as an undergrad , but its small , lightweight and easy to use -- - worth the 28 $ and actually a bit quicker to solve finance problems than MS Excel ( Note : for real world NPVs , I do use Excel since thats more repetitive work and involves alot of different scenario modeling that would be less efficient on a manual calculator . )	1
David Wilson : Thank you my man for your review of the TI BA II . I was getting ready to junk my old 80 's 12C when I noticed in your review of the TI something that made me go back and do something that put my 12C back into action . You saved me some dollars and time . I was about to buy the TI but no need now .	1
Great product . Everything I need as a finance guy . All I need now is my books to be this cheap .	1
This calculator worked perfectly for my Finance class- easy to use and no issues whatsoever . Highly recommend for your finance needs ! Thanks !	1
VALUE PERFORMER GETS NEW LOOKBA2+ users may like to know that Texas Instruments has released a `` new look '' TI BA2+ ( allow me to call it it BA2+N ) , which may come with just more than cosmetic improvements over the popular BA2+.IMPROVED LCD DISPLAYI was able to observed from a short distant away that the LCD display of the BA2+N , is clearer and more contrasty than the orginal BA2+ which I own . TI gets a thumbs up for doing this improvement quietly plus giving a facelift to this already highly regarded value for money business-financial electronic calculator.DID TEXAS INSTRUMENT KILLED SOME BUGS IN THE BA2+ ? Although I have not yet been able to test the BA2+N , TI may have also incorporated some improvements and killed some bugs on the popular BA2+ . It is also probable that some improvements or new functions incorporated on the September 2004 released BA2+ Professional ( BA2+PRO ) may also have been also incorporated into the specs of BA2+N.I would like to believe that some small but extremely annoying bugs of the `` original '' BA2+ has been quietly fixed on the BA2+N . In particular , I wish to see the `` Reset '' button nuisance which clears all user input formatting on the BA2+ has been done alway with . Most users of BA2+ would know that an accident user soft reset would return to the default Number of Periods per year P/Y to 12 , this would upset the results of many TVM calculations when user has set the P/Y to `` 1 '' to use the calculator in `` number of periods '' instead.BATTERY REPLACEMENT WOES ON THE BA2+I was not able to exam a unit of the BA2+N to see if end users would still need a screw driver to unscrew and pry open the BA2+ casing just to replace the CR2032 battery . It would be nice if TI would incorporate a user accessible slide open battery compartment for the BA2+N or future upgrades of the BA2+.MY RECOMMENDATIONWould be buyers should get hold of the BA2+N or buy the BA2+PRO if you have a bigger budget . Budget conscious users could see that for the price of a BA2+ PRO , a screw driver and spare batteries , new users could afford to purchase for themselves two sets of BA2+N.An advantage of having a spare BA2+N set on hand is that users could free themselves from the trouble of carrying a philips screwdriver and replacement lithium batteries to important assignments or to the examination centre.HOW DIFFERENT DOES THE BA2+N LOOKS ? I have downloaded the BA2+N JPEG picture from TI 's calculator site and posted it to the Amazon 's picture gallery.IMPORTANT NOTE : I have commented on the BA2+N as an end user and I do n't work for TI , HP or any of the manufacturers for the products which I have used , reviewed and posted my comments on the pages of Amazon.com . It is my pleasure to be able to share my first look at the BA2+N with you , thanks for reading !	1
I had gotten my first TI calculator in 6th or 7th grade . My TI-83+ has survived about 10 years of being dropped , thrown in frustration , left in hot/cold cars , etc . I bought this calculator for a finance class so that I could enter the calculations I need as they are taught in class rather than figuring it out on my graphing calculator . The first thing I noticed are the keys are n't nearly as good and are kind of annoying to press . The case is n't very solid at all , I get the feeling if I were to drop it that would be the end of this calculator . As for actual calculation it has been fine so far , but you need to change decimal settings . Out of box it rounds to 2 places , which is inadequate . I recommend setting it to 5 .	1
My neighbor ordered this and he said it did a great job . He finished in the top 100 in the world in his field so I guess it did the job .	1
I have owned two TI Business Analyst calculators in the past . One finally broke after many years and I replaced it with this one.The functions provided are extremely useful for so many calculations , like the monthly payback on a loan , what the future value of a series of payments into an IRA would yield at some assumed interest rate , discounting a future sum of money by an assume inflation rate , and many other calculations like converting a stated interest rate to a true annual rate and vice-versa and figuring the yield to maturity of a bond . You name it.A VERY useful book comes with the package , better than the book with my last one because it shows clear examples of how to perform different calculations . It will also suggest some things you can do with the calculator that you may not have intended.The calculator is encased in a protective plastic cover that removes from the calcuator and can be either placed to the side or slid onto the bottom of the case to avoid losing it . The keypad has good feedback , nice feel.The only negative , and this is a nit , is that there 's no battery hatch . You have to take the case apart to replace the coin battery . I do n't know why they 've done that but the batteries last so long ( 5 years ? ) this should n't be an issue.I 've seen HP and Sharp financial calculators and in my view considering the TI 's price , ease of use , and terrific manual , it 's a real winner !	1
I 'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use , and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors . This calculator was required , by name , for a class I am taking , and I begrudgingly bought it . I 'm glad I did . I ca n't believe how easy it is to use . I still like excel or just doing the math ( for simple TVM procedures ) , but am really impressed with the simplicity of this financial calculator.It is well made , cleanly designed , and a worthwhile purchase .	1
I needed a calculator that could replace my simple desk calculator for quick figures at my desk . This one has done very well and seems like it will last some time . I bought Canon as that was my old brand and I like it although since I have large hands I wish it was a tad bit bigger . It was hard to determine which one to get shopping online but I am happy with it . There really is nothing I would like to change on it and will use it for years . Not much else to say as it is a basic calculator .	1
I used this very calculator at my old office and it lasted for years . That 's why I 've kept on buying them . Of all the calculators I have and use , this is my favorite by far and I use it the most . The keys are great - they 're large and spaced apart to reduce input errors , making this the easiest-to-use calculator I 've had . The display is large , raised and easy to see.What makes this calculator so nice is you barely notice it because it allows you to concentrate on what you 're doing . Sure it does n't have lots of functions , just the basic ones , but I have another calculator for that . I tend to use this one all the time and I 'd feel lost without it.This is a remarkable , durable and useful calculator . I 'm perform a lot of accounting in my job , and this is my normal go-to calculator . From the time I ordered it to delivery , only 13.5 hours passed . That 's the fastest I 've had an order fulfilled . Just thought I 'd relate that .	1
This is a great calculator for the money ; easy to use , display is great . Have purchased Canon calculators in the past , and they are always good quality for the money with great features .	1
An alternative will be Canon LS-82Z . I think they are both competent calculators and do what they are supposed to do , except that the 82Z is $ 6.66 cheaper ! ( I should also mention that I calculated that number using a 82Z ! )	1
What does another excellent , but smaller Canon calculator -- the CanonLS-82z -- `` want to be when it grows up '' ? Right ! THIS calculator -- the Canon LS 85H calculator ! `` The smaller calculator -- also reviewed for me by Amazon -- is an excellent little machine . But I can see how its smaller size , ( and in particular , smaller keys ) , would be a problem for those using it on a continual basis . Men especially , as they tend to have larger hands than women ... .The slightly larger , Cannon LS 85H calculator , being reviewed here , is almost as perfect a general-purpose calculator as one can find these days ! A handy size , which is at home either on desk-top or pocket/purse . `` Man-size '' keys , which are still not overwhelmingly large , which a person with the largest hands , and also one with the smallest , can usewith the utmost of ease . The eight-digit display is large , and very well spaced . Nice little `` extras '' , found in most -- but not all -- other general-purpose calculators : a percent key , a square root key , and a sign change key . ( The sign-change key does not appear on the smaller , LS-82Z ) .True , the larger LS-85H calculator has an enclosed , `` wrap-around '' display , ( enclosing the entire top part , all together ) , rather than the `` picture-frame '' display , ( in which the numberic display is indented , and `` framed '' by the rest of the top of the calculator ) of the smaller calculator . ( And I , personally , find the `` picture-frame '' display far more attractive ) . But the larger LS-85H calculator stays on for approximately 3 minutes before turning itself off ... approximately a full minute more than the smaller machine , and this may mean more to many users.About the only things missing from this calculator are an `` off '' key , ( not found on the LS-82z , or on most other calculators , either ) , a `` resume '' key , ( found , at present , only on the large and somewhat cumbersome Sharp ( R ) VX=2128R calculator -- but a feature that would be welcome on ANY calculator ! ) , and a `` live '' battery , ( you know -- an '' AA '' battery , or even two -- which can easily be replaced . Like they used to have when calculators first came out ? ) Oh , oh ... wait a minute ! I see that Canon ALSO has , ( or had ) , another model that looks ALMOST like this one does , but which has , as a model number , LS-85H 4050A001AA ! Looking at the description of it ... .YES ! It has a live battery ! AA ! Sadly , there was only one of these for sale ... ... and , yes ... .this reviewer has done what the vast majority of people would do under the same circumstances ... .grab it ! Hopefully , Canon will produce more of this `` AA '' powered portable calculator ... .as will all other calculator manufacturers ! Replacable lithium batteries are just NOT easy to replace ! ( I see that Canon DOES have a larger , 12-digit `` AA '' powered calculator , still on sale ! -- Canon 7438A003AA ) . It got one 3 star review ... .but if I wanted a larger , 12-digit calculator which uses a `` AA '' battery , I 'd try this one for sure.Anyway , the Canon LS-85H , which is the main calculator being reviewed here , is a good , basic , little machine , with size , keys , and basic features , that feel , and respond , `` just right '' . Great for `` Goldilocks '' , or anyone else you know -- even yourself !	1
I love it ! The first one burst at the seam 2 weeks into it , but I emailed Fellowes and they sent me a replacement . The texture of it is great - like soft shark skin or something .	1
Thanks to a severe flare-up of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome , I found myself in a lot of pain after a day of typing . I finally broke down and bought wrist wrests for both my keyboard and my trackball , and I 'm glad I did even though both took some major getting used to . The keyboard rest is great in most respects , but for me it has two drawbacks : It could be a bit longer , and it pushes the top of my keybard up under my desk ( I have a pull-out shelf arrangement . ) Neither is the fault of Fellowes necessarily , and I mention it only to alert anyone who has a very wide or deep keyboard to these possible ( minor ) problems . I do find , however , that the rest is n't quite high enough for me to avoid some stressing of my wrists.On the plus side , it 's got a backing that 's so extremely non-skid that you have to lift it up to move it . And the gel is loads of fun to play with while you 're thinking . I find myself pinching and poking it , and wondering how long it can take that sort of punishment before it breaks or tears . I do n't recommend this sort of behavior , but if you 're prone to it , this might well give some scope to your nervous figets .	1
It works smoothly in the labeler and the backing is easy to remove . The drawback is that it does n't stick very well to hard plastic surfaces or in cold temperatures . I wanted to label some oversize plastic storage bags in my garage , but they fell right back off . They work best indoors , on non-slick surfaces .	1
Not much to say here . This is the 1/2 & # 34 ; size and I order a smaller size by mistake . ( My own fault ! ! ! ) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it 's just as good as the 1/4 & # 34 ; size . The only problem I 've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface . I do n't have long finger nails so it 's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that 's a bit hard . Otherwise no complains .	1
I have been using Dymo labelers since the 1970 's . They have changed a bit over the years . Now everything is electronic and computerized to some degree . Well , these labels are perfect for any application that requires identification . I highly recommend these labels because they break open in the middle from the rear , making them a `` snap '' to apply .	1
I only wish the label maker itself had better directions on how to install and set up for the various widths of tape available . But that is no fault of the replacement tape itself . The lengthwise split in the backing makes removal of the backing VERY easy . Additionally , it allows the user to stick the label on across only one half of the label first to make sure it 's straight and get out any bubbles or creases - then remove the other half of the backing to smooth the label on the rest of the way . Very good design .	1
Great tape but hard to find . There are no local retailers selling this product . Was informed that due to new designs this tape not selling enough to carry on local shelves . Thank heavens for Amazon . Was n't looking forward to having to buy a new label maker just because of obslesence .	1
This was exactly what I had ordered . . . they were set at a great price and with my prime account the value is unbeatable : )	1
A simple cartridge for your Dymo printer that prints black letters on white background . It is 1/2 inch wide and 23 feet long . I like the spilt back that is easy to peel off so you can stick the label quickly . The Amazon price is very good as it is cheaper with free delivery than our local stores .	1
Although my ordering of this product was totally accidental I decided to keep it since it is such a wonderful product . I just will not run out of tape for quite a while . I would highly recommend this product and remember the most expensive label makers are not necessarily the best.2-16-2012I did not open this product right away but when I did I found the incorrect item had been sent not just by one company but two ; neither of which are Amazon.com . I have actually stopped doing business with one company because they would not allow me to return the item .	1
Yeah , it prints just great ? ! ? It 's 4 stars only because I do think it 's a touch expensive for printed words on sticky tape , but I 'm also not labeling my entire house because ... hello ... I 'm not a weirdo like that . Just would like my husband to NOT use my back up hard drive .	1
This labeling tape is pretty good , and it is darn near impossible to screw it up : drop it into the label machine , type up your label ( s ) , have it print , then peel off the backing and apply . I actually love these labels vs. what I have used in the past as it is truly a print , peel , and stick type of label with no mess and crisp , professional-looking fonts . This tape is also much better than the tape that originally came with the machine as this tape is much longer and will last for a lot more labels.To top everything else off as I type this review , I saved a little over $ 6 as the price I paid on Amazon was $ 13.59 vs. $ 19.99 for the same exact roll at the Office Depot down the street .	1
It arrived right on time . We used it right away & would order again . The cost per labrl is inexpensive .	1
I love my DYMO label machine and have multiple choices of color tapes is perfect for all my various needs .	1
The DYMO D1 labeling tape fit my Dymo Labelmanager Pnp Printer perfectly . I like the looks of the labels and so far they stick very well in the applications I have found for them . The tape seems a bit pricy , but not out of line with any other label maker tape .	1
My labeling is n't extensive . I 'm not cutting labels every day . But when I do I want to make neat labels that stay . Dymo labeling takes does it in a way very easy to use , is economical and stays put . The back peels off easily and application is nice . If I peel them off they come off clean ( so far ) without adhesive left behind .	1
Works fine . No problems . Same as the tape that came with the printer but much longer . Easy to peel . Most importantly Amazon 's price is six dollars less then my local box store . Now that deserves five stars !	1
The tape is clean looking , prints up nice & stays where you put it . I use it on anything that I want to put the name on . For one spice jars . Files etc .	1
Double check that this is the size you need .	1
I might have gotten other labels for less money , but I must say that these labels have performed flawlessly . I could not take the chance of labels coming off large envelopes , so I paid the premium price .	1
I use these all the time and the value is wonderful as is the convenience of the printer . I use the labels for both business and personal	1
simply very similar to the one that cost 5 times more ! does what it suppose to do for much much less .	1
Using for my business labels ... loving this larger size for that purpose . Lasting a long time too so that 's awesome too .	1
I use these labels continuously for shipping Amazon Marketplace items . I never have any feed issues and the consistency of the paper and print are very consistent . The adhesive on these is very good and will permanently stick on packages , even on top of packaging tape . I would fully recommend this product for anyone wanting to print address labels as well as address labels with return & address on all one , or any other need for larger labels .	1
Nice mouse pad in fire engine red . since I 'm an ex-field artillery officer , I love it too much GI.Gunner April , 2014	1
I do n't have anything bad to say , it works well , it does what it is supposed to , but it is a mouse pad . Enough said .	1
Just the right size for a smaller desk and a bluetooth mouse to sit beside the kid 's laptop . Brilliant red . Really good price and saved getting out in the crowds to buy a smaller item . Love the `` add-on '' feature , but shipping with Prime is free anyway ! Bought a few while I was at it , good price , excellent quality .	1
For the price alone I gave this four stars . It is basic old fashioned soft foam with a knit fabric top . The best thing about this pad is the beautiful red color ( which is why I ordered it ) so if you care about that I recommend it . If you have an older mouse I think this pad will be fine , but for my optical Logitech M305 the soft material creates a bit of drag , it performs better with the denser , thinner foam and smoother plastic type top . I have found a good use for it , however , when I travel with my laptop and do n't have a table or place to use the mouse . I cut it in half , placing the half on the bottom flat part of my laptop , the softer foam of this pad stays in place better on the laptop .	1
The color is almost exactly as shown on the amazon.com site . I thought by the description it would be thicker , but it is better than the free one I got at the bank , yet not the old heavy neoprene style . Still , it does what it needs to do and is so pliable I can fold it and put it in a purse .	1
This mouse pad works great with my optical mouse . It is n't thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad . It 's the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead-filled wrist cushion . It is a COMFORTABLE mouse pad covered with a soft polyester fabric attached to a non-skid sponge rubber base . The texture provides good control for my mouse . For me , it 's the perfect mouse pad , it 's a nice color , and the price is right , too !	1
Thiner than any other mouse pad I have bought , but holding up ok so far after 6 months . Pretty cheap price online .	1
This mousepad is very thin and it is a bit clumsy to move around but the product infoon the product page says the top is made of durable polyester , so it might bedurable enough to buy .	1
IT IS JUST SIMPLE MOUSE PAD CAN USE WITH ALL TYPE OF MOUSE.I AM OK WITH IT NO PROBLEM AT ALL	1
Bought this for my wife 's red laptop . It matches the computer and it works fine as a mousepad . Nuff said !	1
This little laminator is super easy to use . Just plug it in , turn it on , and wait for it to warm up . When it is warmed up , it beeps and a light comes on . You are now ready to laminate your cards . This little machine is durable , user friendly , and super easy ! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quality machine for a decent price .	1
We purchased this Fellowes Laminator to produce high quality durable laminate tags for our personal sports bags , gun cases and suitcases . This laminator works flawlessly and produces very professional looking laminate tags .	1
I love this little unit . Slim , trim , portable quiet and does the job fast and effectively . I 've been laminating EVERYTHING and then some . Laminated proof of insurance certificate , Registrations for cars , boats , motorcycles and waverunners , Medication List & Physicians List cards ( I typed a list of our medications and our doctors names and phone on a business card so I have it handy in case of emergency or filling out forms ) Old photos , ID cards , newspaper clippings , prayer cards ( the ones you get from funerals ) , anything that would be beneficial to protect , I laminated . It takes just SECONDS to do , and it comes out perfectly every time . Just picked up more business size laminating pouches from my local office supply , and I 'm ready for more !	1
For small laminating jobs this is a must . Why spend money and time going to Staples , Office Depot etc . when you can do this job yourself .	1
This is a very cute machine perfect to laminate credit card size documents . Works great and excellent buy . I do recommend for small scale projects .	1
There is n't much one can say about a black mouse pad . The vendor shipped it on time and in adequate packaging . It works well , measuring 8 inches by nine inches and about one-eighth of an inch thick . I have washed it once and it looks like it did when it was new ... a very nice , if under-appreciated , mouse pad .	1
I wanted a thin full size mouse pad for traveling . Something that is light weight , fits into a carry bag without taking up a bunch of space , I can fold it , roll it up or whatever and this baby fills my needs exactly . Plus , the mouse glides easily . I can also use it to set a hot cup of coffee on it while sitting at someone else 's fine desk . Perfect for me .	1
Great for the money . We like it and the mouse behaves well on it . Small , super lightweight , but rubber back keeps it from moving .	1
Kind of smaller than I would haver preferred , but it does the job . I am getting to the point that I favor the rather larger takes on mouse pads , this one works and seems sturdy enough . 4 Stars .	1
This mousepad has a smooth surface and works great with my mouse . It 's nothing fancy but it works and the price is right .	1
I like this mouse pad a lot . It is a very soft fabric that clings to the table , so my mouse does n't move around much . It has no visible logos on it . I think that 's also nice because I find logos can be really distracting . It is a good value at under $ 4 . I would buy this again . Just attach this add on item to your shopping cart of over $ 25 . I am thinking of getting another one actually .	1
I purchased this mouse pad for playing Starcraft 2 and it works just fine as it provides smooth operation with an Anker Lazer Gaming Mouse . The mouse pad does n't move around at all on my desk during frantic game playing and is a good size . The price of $ 2.99 ( as an adder ) ca n't be beat even though I 'm curious as to how long it will last compared to more expensive ones .	1
I was hesitant to buy this after seeing the mixed reviews , but since it was relatively cheap , I decided to try it out . It came packaged with a stiff cardboard backing , so it was flat and did n't have any curling issues some other mousepads have . People have complained that the mousepad was too thin , but on my desk that is not an issue and I actually like how close to the table it lies as opposed to have a thick slab of a mousepad on my desk . I hold my mouse in a claw grip which means I do n't put a lot of weight on it , so I have n't noticed any friction issues , but when I switch over to a palm grip ( putting the whole hand on the mouse so it does get heavier ) I do notice that there is a noticeable amount of friction between the mouse ( amazonbasics 3-button mouse ) and the mousepad . I am a tad concerned that the cloth portion might fray off of the mousepad , but only time can tell . After a significant amount of usage I 'll post an update .	1
I am reordering these mouse pads becuase they are great and simple . I have purchased about 4 of these so far and love them .	1
We 've moved on from the thick mousepads of yesterday and graduated to what 's more functional -- thin . You do n't hit the edge of the wall on this , and it works great with optical mice . Many thing mouse pads are plastic top and cause issues with optical mice.A good price and works as expected .	1
With the heavy wear that I give a mouse pad , I found that often I would have trouble getting the cursor precisely where I wanted . Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react . I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality , sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent . The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor . The trouble with the sensitivity of the `` click '' was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad . It meets all my requirements .	1
This pad is soft and is this , it 's the perfect mouse pad . The top is fabric but that 's great the mouse always works on this .	1
Packaging says that the mouse pad is 50 % pre-consumer recycled content , and that the packaging card is 100 % post-consumer recycled material.Seems like a decent mouse pad and it 'll fit my needs . I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have -- over time -- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers . You therefore need to wash them frequently . I do n't mean to slight a product because of it 's color , but this pad should be available in grey or dark grey .	1
It 's a nice , basic mousepad that does the job . I take it with me on business trips because I prefer using a small mouse with my laptop instead of the fingerpad . This mousepad is nonslip and durable .	1
the hard plastic back allows me to use the mouse anywhere , couch , leg , arm chair ... happy . the little wrist pad is nice as well .	1
We love these and our on our 2nd set of two of these . They last a few years and are good quality . The traction is great , easy use , small but not too small to navigate , and easy on the wrist .	1
TFellowes Gel Mouse Rest and Pad ( Sapphire Color ) his mouse pad is great , it 's wrist pad is just wonderful . I have arthritis I do not have anymore pain . I would definitely recommend this item .	1
It works as expected - wonderfully ! I am no going to purchase an ergonomic keyboard and mouse ! The only thing is when I play online games , I have to turn the mouse rest with the wrist rest to the left in order to play appropriately - but I am very happy with the purchase . Oh , and if you always have had issues with the mouse falling or slipping off of the mouse rest - it will not occur ever again with this purchase ! ! ! ! Thank you Amazon !	1
If you spend long hours at your computer this mouse pad will make things a little more bearable . Very well made . And I found I could reverse it , front to back , and use it when my wrists were really tired.I do n't think you can go wrong with this pad . Well worth the money .	1
Perfect grasping of optical gaming mouse for great dpi sensing . Also the gel wrest is highly recommended to help curb carpal tunnel syndrome , as it lifts the wrist during repetitive motion . It might seem a little hard on the wrist at first , but that becomes moot soon enough .	1
Great toner for my work printer .	1
It sure was nice to get the toner cartridge good for 6000 pages rather than 3000 and the same price ... goes down as a no brainer ! !	1
It 's been exactly 2 years ( as Amazon.com reminded me ) since I last purchased this toner . ( I just reordered . ) I use reams of paper in my work , hence lots of ink , as well . Never a problem , excellent copy . I recommend this product highly .	1
this looks like it 's the real thing - Brother made - I have been burned buy knock offs - which do n't work or work poorly - thanks Amazon for not selling crap	1
The HP color printer cartridge prints the colors it is supposed to and is fairly crisp .	1
Long-lasting output , vivid color on multipurpose paper xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx	1
What can you say about ink cartridges . Best value for the money when they are no longer being sold at normal outlets .	1
These inks are great and long lasting . I have been using these on HP3915 printer . I do n't use the printer much , and replace them once every year . No smudges/marks and well designed . I have been using HP printers and inks since 1999 . Definitely recommend ! The reason for 4 stars is it is expensive . The quality is good .	1
A good ink with free shipping availability . I buy ink only with original printer manufacturer brand .	1
I never really like matte inkjet papers or for traditional photo papers either . But I decided to give this a try for a reason that escapes me now . But it was a good idea . I love this paper . It is matte without too much of a rough texture and then tones are fantastic .	1
MATTE WAS MY PREFERENCE IN TRADITIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY : It has always been my preference to have pictures done on a matte medium . While using traditional pictures especially if you like I did switched to the APS format , you could no longer get a matte finish . Since I have gone digital , the only papers , that I have seen have been glossy , so this was a pleasant surprise.A CO-WORKER WHO IS ALSO A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER , INTRODUCED ME TO THIS PAPER : Knowing I used many reams of paper in glossy prints but really liked matte , a co-worker told me of this matte finish ink jet paper and showed me a photo he had done . Wow ! He had the Epson 890 like I did , so I had to run out and get some of this amazing paper . His daughter in the photo , was wearing a red dress and it was amazing in depth of color.MY TEST SHOTS WERE PHENOMENAL : I was not dissappointed in the results . Though I have used it only on a couple of shots ( I consider my test shots ) , I was amazed at the crispness of the photo . Only time will tell how well it lasts . I plan to subject some to the ultimate test ( for me ) hung on my office wall without a frame . I 'll write back and tell you how it did.NO GLARE MEANS THE PICTURE JUMPS RIGHT OUT AT YOU : What I particularly like about matte pictures is the lack of glare . You do n't have to get the right angle to view it . Also there is almost a 3D effect since you do n't see the surface of the paper to make it flat . That is really nice.MATTE IS CHEAPER THAN GLOSSY : Matte paper at 50 pages per sheet cost also about the same of 20 sheets of glossy paper.. That too is a good thing .	1
I 've used Epson 's Premium Glossy , Colorlife and Heavyweight Matte . The Matte is far cheaper and gives beautiful results . I 've actually found that I like the Matte best for framing . It has a less reflective surface and looks more 'arty ' than photographic . But I would n't recommend it for architectural , detailed photographs . A good benefit of both the Matte and Colorlife is that they have the longest rated life without fading of any paper for use with Epson 's dye based printers .	1
Epson makes great printer papers . I use Epson 's matte paper almost as much as the regular inkjet paper . This paper is made for color presentation and graphic . I print out my portfolio and sample work with matte paper because it is relatively cheap to the high quality printout . I use the Epson 820 and the color print matches the monitor colors ( 98 % ) almost perfect.For photo prints it is fine , but photos are simultaneous with glossy texture . If you like glossy photo then this is not the photo paper you would get . The colors do not jump at you nor have sharp deferential qualities that glossy can produce . Printing plain texts without color might be too wasteful ( costly ) for matte paper . I considered Epson the best in paper qualities over Canon , HP , Kodak and others for the quality/price . I have switched to the Canon i960 and am still using Epson 's paper . It is that versatile . I tend to use the harder to find Epson double-side matte paper .	1
When I want a matte paper that is lighter weight than the really heavy photo papers but heavier than the standard grade presentation paper , this is what I use . It produces photos that are crisp and vibrant . There is a lighter version of this , the Epson Presentation Paper , Matte . It produces exactly the same quality prints if you want an even lighter paper than this . I have both versions , this one is 44 lb , the lighter weight version is 27 lb.If you are doing something that requires a little more stiffness to your project , this would work great . If you just need great quality prints on a fairly light paper , go with the 27 lb version.One final note , these are NOT for two sided printing . The back side is a darker shade , and does not have the smooth finish . If you print on the back by mistake it will not turn out well . If I 'm working in dim lighting I need to hold a back against a front so I can tell the difference for when I load my printer .	1
I use this paper to print out the original copies of my association newsletter . It makes VERY clear original prints , which then are used to make color copies for our members . Much better than printing on regular inkjet paper . Also , I use it for printing pictures taken in the classroom . The students can cut and mount their pictures when doing writing projects .	1
This is a great presentation paper . Prints on very nice , the color are good and sharp . Usable for many uses . Just make sure your printer is set right .	1
We have used this paper to make brochures for a Real Estate Business . It does the job well and have not experienced any problems .	1
I have been using this product since its inception and it is perfect for my needsI is a of a heavy enough weight to print fine art photos , yet not so thick my new fancy printer will havea hissy fit over.The colors or black and white look gorgeous on this and they dry very quickly unlike with the glossy kind.when I need to print up some ad material that will be folded these work well.Overall a great product for business or personal use.Highly recommend	1
Once I set the ( Epson Workforce 845 ) printer to `` best photo '' quality , it worked well and got intense colors . However , laying down that much ink on the paper made the paper crinkle somewhat from all the liquid .	1
I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper . I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive . The quality of this paper is OK , heavier than standard paper , and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good . The thing is , I cut down the price per piece , by also using a lot of white space , from over $ 2 apiece to about .50 , without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper , saturated business graphics look good , your vacation shots will not.For the price , give it a try for graphics .	1
I was very happy with this paper.My only issue is you have to be smart enough ( which I was n't ) to figure out which side to print on . One side is white , the other is off-white . If you print on the wrong side it does n't come out well .	1
Good quality prints at a very good price . Paper strength as disappointing but the images were vivid , but not the best photo quality	1
I am using a Pro 9000 Mark II and this paper is wonderful for presenting projects that do not require photo paper . I would recommend this to any graphic designer looking to minimize their footprint while not sacrificing the quality of their work . Beautiful prints on plain paper setting with high clarity.Make sure you see which side of the paper you are printing on . It will make a difference in the outcome as this is a one sided presentation paper . The other side has a yellowish tint to it !	1
I use it before printing a photo for a proof . And also to make shooting targets . It prints crystal clear . The price was right . I keep it around for stock for my shop too .	1
This is great for my purposes . I wanted paper that was lighter weight than the heavier matte papers , but I still wanted my photos to be crisp and vibrant . I am doing fliers with photos , and this paper is absolutely perfect ! This is the Presentation Paper , Matte , and it prints EXACTLY like the 'Premium ' ( heavyweight ) version . I have both versions , and I love both , but sometimes I do n't want or need the weight or expense of the heavier papers . This one is 27 lb , the premium version is 44 lb . Both are great quality , and prints look exactly the same on both . The only difference is the weight.One final note , these are NOT for two sided printing . The back side is a darker shade , and does not have the smooth finish . If you print on the back by mistake it will not turn out well . If I 'm working in dim lighting I need to hold a back against a front so I can tell the difference for when I load my printer .	1
I bought these by mistake ... must have been distracted , I thought I was buying photocopy paper . Anyway , I kept them and i 'm sure they will come in handly for something in the future . They seem to be of good quality . If you are looking for Matte Presentation Paper , you will probably be happy with this product .	1
Really nice paper . Has good color and sharp words . Works great for pamphlets and many other uses . Be sure you printer is set wright for this paper and the results are great .	1
I bought these from Ink Express ( R S I Inc. ) here on amazon . They appear to be OEM canon cartridges but they are not in a blister pack as illustrated on amazon , just 2 cartridges in a little plain brown box with an Ink Express label . Each cartridge has its plastic wrapper intact . I installed the first one in my printer . Hopefully it will be fine.I only use genuine canon cartridges so I would feel better if they came in the canon blister pack as shown on amazon but I decided not to return them . I see that today they are being offered by another seller and Ink Express does not have any more for sale . It makes me wonder where these come from or how long they have been sitting around.I had picked up another canon cartridge from a well-known online auction site and it had very old canon labeling . I contacted canon and they said the cartridges do not become outdated and it was safe to use . However it lasted a lot shorter than my ink tanks usually do . Just a few words to the wise .	1
it 's ink ... from canon . Works perfectly as it is intended.Please do n't buy and review things and be stupid about them . Ie. , if you do n't want to spend money for ink ... do n't buy printers . We all know how much inks costs ... or relatively so.I love buying the canon 4 packs when I start running out of ink.I bought the pack when my magenta indicator was active and just waited . Then it seemed like cyan followed a short while later , and then yellow and black are still waiting to join the group ; ) .Canon products are the best , from camcorders , cameras , scanners , printers and ink . I have the Canon HV20 , CanoScan5000f , and Canon i850 .	1
These cartridges always worked perfectly in my Pixma 5000 photo printer . This printer finally died because of rough handling during a move . If it had n't been dropped , it would still be going strong today ! The most durable and reliable printer I have ever owned . Tried third party cartridges , but they were terrible . Always stick with the Canon cartridges and your printer will last longer and print perfectly .	1
The ink tank arrived on time and in good condition . It prints well even on the lowest-quality printer setting ( no streaks , stray marks , etc. ) . It is easy to install and to replace when necessary .	1
These inks are inexpensive and a great value for your dollar . Only buy authentic ink as some generic inks will smudge or damage your printer . I have used Canon brand ink for years and have nothing but satisfaction for them . Quality is consistent and is a trusted brand worldwide .	1
I have an old Canon i550 which uses the BCI-3e ink cartridges . FYI , should Canon discontinue this 4-color 3e series , I found BCI-6 cartridges ( BCI-6C-6M-6Y ) fits and works great without any problem . Thank you Amazon , for providing the inkjet replacement information check list .	1
I am always wary of ordering ink for my printer online . According to reviews , what is shown is not always what is received . These were factory sealed exactly as shown in the picture , original Canon . Very happy .	1
I have been using Canon inks and printers for years and awhile back , I decided to try out some of those generic ink tanks and ink kits ( you know , the ones with the syringes ? ) . Both ruined my printer , after awhile . They seem to work initially , but you can tell the colors are off . Sure , the generic inks are so much cheaper , but the costs of getting a new printer are going to make up for those few $ you saved on ink . Trust me on this one , buy Canon OEM cartridges !	1
I have had a Canon S630 for over a year now , and I love it . After having problems with Epson and HP printers , I tried the Canon and was astonished with the print quality . The only down side is I got my S630 before they came out with the larger format version , which I would have wanted . Certainly not Canon 's fault there . I have printed 8x10s from a 2 megapixel Olympus digital camera , and was pleased with how close it came to 35mm for the price . Since 35mm has considerably more resolution than 2 megapixels , obviously there is a clear difference . However , this printer did a fine job of substituting for the One Hour Photo average picture taking level , and has saved me a ton of money.I also do not recommend generic or refill inks for printers , as I had an HP printer ruined by them . I prefer the separate tanks for each color as well , for the simple fact that they do n't make you waste ink . I have gotten over 40 8x10s out of one set of ink tanks , but it varies widely with color saturation and picture content , so I do n't think it is possible to give any accurate figures for usage . Another plus for Canon is that the print head is not a part of the ink cartridge , so you do n't have to pay to replace that every time you replace ink tanks , unlike some other brands of printers . While there may be some value to that kind of system , Canon 's system is less expensive to the user.The ink does n't seem to dry out very fast with long periods of inactivity , although it is better for the printer to use it regularly . I also like the fact that the low ink warnings give enough time so that one can plan one 's usage carefully to maximize what you have left and not run out of a color in the middle of a critical print .	1
Much to my dismay , this more expensive branded ink works considerably better than the inexpensive stuff . I 've tried both -- the knock off brands tend to run a little more , and they also smudge when they get at all damp . The Canon inks print more crisply and hold onto the paper better.For draft printing , the knockoffs are fine , but otherwise , go with the Canon inks .	1
I love the canon Ink it works good and it does clog up your printers gives you beautiful photos I will never change this brand Thanks again amazon for another job well done	1
I really like this label maker . I also have another similar model . The only bad thing I have to say about this is the tapes are expensive and can be hard to find . This unit also comes with a shorter `` starter '' cartridge instead of a regular one . I could n't find the black on white tape on Amazon.com ( sold by Amazon.com ) , but unless you label a lot the tapes will probably last awhile . I also like the QWERTY keyboard on this unit.UPDATE 2008-12-30 : Batteries : I just bought a PT-80 . The PT-65 uses 6 AA batteries while the PT-80 only uses 4 AAA batteries . I think the 6 AA battery requirement for the PT-65 is a bit much , especially if you do n't print that many labels ( like me ) . One or two of the batteries ( Rayovac Alkaline ) in my PT-65 ended up leaking.Another minor issue may be the amount of blank tape at each end of the label seems a but wasteful and excessive.I think I will like my new PT-80 even more , so check into that model .	1
I purchased this little machine about 10 years ago . I really needed one for a few quick labels . It was cheap and since I did n't think I would be using it for a long term I would try it . I did buy several replacement tapes at the time ( I was positive I would not be able to get any in 6 months ) Well it is at least 10 years , The machine works as well as it did new and labels are still available . If I had a need for one I would not hesitate spending what they are asking for this one . A trick I 've learned is to run the front of the tape gently across your thumb and a dull knife then flip the label over and with a bit more pressure run the tape on the paper side . Like curling ribbon , but not as much pressure . It works like magic . Any stiff , smooth , straight edge will do . If you are in need of one of these I highly recommend this one . I have gone through about 25 tapes , the cutter still works like it is supposed to . I 'm not sure how many labels you can get out of a refill but they seem to last forever . I just popped the last one in my machine , so I am replacing my stock . I will only buy 2 this time because they seem to be available . I will look to brother the next time I need a machine that they make . I am no longer angry about the 6 month old typewriter I could n't get a ribbon for 30 years ago lol .	1
This little baby works great for labeling just about anything . The interface is intuitive and easy to use , the print options are pretty good for an inexpensive machine , and print quality is superb . The only thing keeping this from garnering 5 stars is the printed label backing . Although it sticks great to just about anything , it can sometimes be a challenge to remove the backing from the tape .	1
I love my label-maker and ca n't imagine life without it . I label Rubbermaid totes , charging cables , A/V equipment , boxes , leftovers for the freezer , etc ... and the tape always sticks to everything . The only thing I do n't like is the wasted space before and after the printed text , but it 's not enough to keep me from giving this baby five stars.I love the QWERTY keyboard . There 's enough variety in printing ( sizes , special characters , outlines , etc . ) to keep things interesting , and it 's fairly easy to understand without having to resort to the instructions each time . That said , I 'm fairly bland with it and pretty much use one or two main settings all the time .	1
I have had this labeller for several years , and never had the label tape bind up . The unit is easy to use -- hitting the function keys allows you to change print size , and there is a cutter on the side to dispense the label when printed . The previous entry stays on the screen for printing multiple copies . It 's a useful device for labeling food bags in the freezer , making file folder labels , and any number of things that I used to label with the old embossing type label tape . The batteries seem to last plenty long ( it takes AA 's . ) No complaints here , priceworthy and works well .	1
We owned another labeler made by Dymo and were not very happy with it . The keys were laid out alphabetically rather than QWERTY style and typing felt unnatural . We also could not find any store that carried blank label cartridges - even the store we bought it from ( Best Buy ) did n't . We had to order them directly from the manufacturer and probably paid more than we needed to.Although the old labeler still works , we decided to purchase this one . It is a much better product . The keypad is easy to use and the unit has some great features built into it . I like the fact that you can change fonts , or frames and can print on a variety of colors . The labels seem to stick much better than the Dymo brand labels we used before . They adhere to surfaces that I could n't get cellophane tape to stick to . Almost every office supply or electronic store seems to sell the label cartridges in several colors and sizes.I only have two negative comments about this unit . First , sometimes it is hard to peel the back off of the label . You have to try to get your fingernail or similar object between the backing and the label and this is often difficult to do . Second , it needs SIX AA batteries to run . If you print a lot of labels you 're going to be buying a lot of batteries . I wish that they could have designed it to run off of an AC power source also.Despite these negatives , I think that this is great product . It works well , is compact , and is reasonably priced .	1
My husband bought this so he could label his files at work ( since even HE ca n't usually read his own writing ) . One day , he brought it home so he could print labels while watching TV . Silly man . I started using it to make labels , and he 's never been able to get it away from me.In the kids ' rooms , I used it to label toy shelves and drawers so that even my pre-schooler knew where to put away his clean clothes . That was almost a year ago , and the labels have stayed in place through countless grubby fingers grabbing at them , as well as countless times I 've scrubbed away at the marks those grubby fingers leave.In the kitchen , I did n't stop at labeling cannisters or jars . I labeled drawers , shelves and cupboards , too ! Now , neither my husband nor the kids have an excuse to avoid emptying the dishwasher , because they know where everything goes ! As in the kids ' rooms , the labels have stayed put and held up to repeated cleanings.In the guest room , where the lightswitch operates three separate lights and a ceiling fan , I labeled the switch plate so my guests do n't have to waste time flipping switches to find the one they want to turn on or off . Numerous visitors have commented on how helpful this has been , particularly when they 're groggy in the morning.Of course , it 's been essential in the storage room where clearly-written labels have saved us hours of hunting around in boxes and bins . I even labeled spots on my husband 's tool bench . Now when I borrow a pair of pliers or screwdriver he 's no longer complaining that I do n't return it to the right place.This product is sturdy , too . My 5-year-old has taken a turn printing up labels and yanking out the tape . Although the tape has jammed in there a few times when he 's done this ( and I 'm fairly certain any label-maker 's tape would do the same thing ) , it 's been a cinch to get straightened out . It 's even survived being dropped on the floor a number of times.I am impressed , and I 'm also addicted to this thing . Naturally , my friends and family members all teased me over my addicition ... until I gave them each one . Now they 're addicts , too !	1
The PT-65 has become a lifesaver in my workplace . Since I work with Nortel phone systems , life can get pretty wild when you have a load of phones to punch down on blocks that go to different wings of a building . I carry the PT-65 with me to new job sites and label each punch-down block so that I can easily keep track of what goes where . Also , the labels look very professional when placed on folders in the office.Overall , this labeler is quite easy to use and very convenient to carry around from job to job . I 'm sure it works great with computers , filing systems , and even baseball card collections as well .	1
This is a nice labeler . I got it as a present more than a year ago and have found that it has so many uses . I label everything with it . I can choose different type styles and sizes . I can underline and choose a frame . I can even check the length of the label before I print it.The labels are waterproof . I 've labeled ice packs that I keep in the freezer and send to school with my kids . I 've also labeled food containers that end up in the dishwasher . The labels do not come off when wet , not even in the dishwasher.There are so many uses for this labeler . It 's a great buy .	1
Excellent product ! This is one of the first electronic devices that gets my & quot ; thumbs up ! & quot ; within the first day of using it ! And it get addicting making labels , for this thing here , that thing there . Fun and easy ! Excellent design , very comfortable to hold in your hand with a good weight/balance [ not too heavy , not too light ] and good size . The buttons are not too small and the arrangement of the buttons are easily accessible and easy to learn.Excellent accessories with different types of ink/tapes and sizes ! Very good printout of labels , quick and no jamming ! and easy to cut . Wonderful smoothness and professional look to the labels . Good stickiness to objects too [ plastic , metal , leather , paper ] , waterproof as well.I would recommend this 100 % , Brother 's has created a product that is affordably cheap and easy to use , fun and reliable . Nothing to complain !	1
Bic Pens : from plain ( like these ) to `` fancy '' , they write , they write , they write -- they are inexpensive , seem to last a looong time , and create GREAT multiple copies because you press em as hard as you want and they write , they write , they write.Best little pen I ever had . Use em far more often than I use my Parkers ( which I also love )	1
36 pens with 2-day Amazon Prime delivery ? Yes please ! Seriously though , these are just what you expect : good old Bic ball point pens . Prices seem to vary on this product , so I 'd suggest browsing through the various sizes/colors to find the current best deal .	1
I have several friends who are servers at my favorite restaurant . They go through a lot of pens - customers take them , bussers toss them , they drop them , etc . This package , as an 'add-on ' item , cost under 10 cents per pen so I ordered two and took them in . BIC pens are pretty reliable for taking orders and are cheap enough they do n't mind putting them down with credit card receipts .	1
Used to purchase pens from costco and sams club but they would n't write on paper when written on top of glass . these bic pens always work the best and the blue was just cheaper but is more vibrant color so works out well when signing paperwork	1
I think we 've all used these pens for thousands of years , or so it seems ! This is usually one product on which you can count , to not leak all over the place and still write nicely , and for a long time . However , I noticed that they 're now made in Mexico . Why on earth ? Bic , you need to come back home to make these . Other than that , highly recommend !	1
Indeed , as another reviewer has stated , these pens have been around for almost ever . There of course is a reason for this ... actually several reasons . First they are quite inexpensive . Second , they actually write . Third they are available anywhere . Forth , they do no leak . They last quite a long time . And finally , they are not unpleasant to write with.I substitute teach which means I can be in a 3rd grade class one day and in an advanced high school class the next ... I never know . I carry a very large canvas pouch with me stuffed with stuff . I always carry at least two or three packs of these pens with me as invariably , sure as the sun rises , there will be at least one or two kids who forgot their pen or pencil ( I always keep several packages of pencils too ... but that is for another review ) . I have also noted that some classes and some students will actually try to take advantage of a substitute teacher and their third favorite request the instant the bell rings is `` can I go to my locker ... I forgot my pen . '' Ha ... I have the little twerps ! And I do n't even have to be mean about it like I do with the endless bathroom and drink requests.Anyway , these pens work great . They do not leak all over the place and smudge . If the student forgets to return the pen ... which often happens , I am not out a lot of money and they are less likely to steal them as they do not really look all that cool nor do they have a lot of whistles and bells on them.As an additional advantage , I do not mind writing short notes with them myself , and I am one of those people who are constantly misplacing pens all over the house and at my desk . I have found that even I have trouble loosing these things if I buy them a dozen at a time . Anyway , they write smoothly and get the job done.Like another reviewer here , I am not all that happy about these not being manufactured in this country anymore and think it is a shame ... but what are you going to do ? I guess it is worth it if we can make the fat cats fatter . I will note that when the company changed the manufacturing location , to save money I presume , I certainly did not see the price of these things , cheap though they may be , going down any , for us , the consumer.Be that as it may , I certainly can recommend these things . They do what they were meant to do.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
What can one say about these pens ? They 're about the most basic pens imaginable . They have a plain , cylindrical body , a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap , and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within . They wo n't win any beauty contests , but they do put ink on paper , and they do it cheaply . Is n't that what really counts at the end of the day ? One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly . Other than that , these are perfectly adequate and the price really ca n't be beat .	1
I LOVE LOVE LOVE these ! This is my Second Order of these which I have placed ! When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do , I am a Very Happy Camper ! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last ! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink , with very little use . I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals , does a lot of writing , or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use ! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars ! Thanks BIC and AMAZON ! These were a Great Deal and well worth purchasing !	1
Good pens and the price is right . I do n't like to pay an extreme price for pens but i expect them to work . These fill the bill nicely .	1
I got these for a steal on Amazon sometime after Thanksgiving . These BICs are my favorite pens to use , even if they are n't too fancy . Overall , I love these , and I will probably buy a million more of them in my lifetime .	1
We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens , with the white barrel , medium or fine points . I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design . It says white barrel in the description , but I hoped to get this new color . Luckily I did . The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside , and it looks more interesting than the traditional white . But , I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it . It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always , too . Not as good as the Cristal pens , but decent . The Cristal pens have a wider point or something , even though these are both labeled as medium points . If you want a basic blue ballpoint , this is it .	1
These were being offered when school was starting for most as an add on option that Amazon now offers with their sellers . We got a great deal and a good amount of them when they were offered . The spiral did n't unwind like some of lesser quality do . We use these spirals for work , school and home use .	1
What can i say it is a notebook with paper in it . It does what it is intended to do . I gave it 4 stars because i do n't like red . Well thats not the notebooks fault it is mine . Maybe i am being picky , do you think ?	1
but it also has to be affordable . We have order many of these notebooks to use as a journal for our clients to use . it 's a great product and will continue to order as needed .	1
This purchase is such a no brainer . Note that Amazon only lets you buy a total of three of these , but it can help you make the $ 25 free shipping threshold . At present , these are going for 45 cents versus the 51 cents I paid . You can not purchase these in the grocery store for that price , which is where I usually get them . I go through these notebooks regularly , using them for shopping lists and planning events . Okay , I 'm getting to the point that at times I have to write things down because I ca n't remember them otherwise . You say , why not post its ? Yes , I use those too , but occasionally the project is much more than a post it can handle . For instance , when I go away for one or two weeks , there are a number of things I have to remember to do during the seven days before I leave . So , I dedicate a page for each day and write down the things that have to be done . Similarly , Thanksgiving is coming up . For the two weeks prior , I have a ton of things that need to be done before T Day , and then each day I check off the things as they are completed . Never mind Christmas . You get the idea . I do n't care about whether there is a particular quality to the paper or whether the perforation is perfect . The pages are torn out as tasks are completed . And yes , I have even given them to my grandkids for their school projects , with no complaints .	1
For the price , surprisingly decent notebooks , arrived in just a few days ( from MeadWestvaco ) , and no qualms with the paper quality etc . Will buy again whenever I need economical notebooks .	1
i finally have a book that i write all my lyrics and poems : ) & # 60 ; 3 yippy its a great : )	1
My notebook with a bluish-purple cover arrived within several days of placing the order . The price alone for this notebook is good , but when you consider free delivery , it 's an even better deal . I always like having spare notebooks around in case I need notebook paper or a student needs paper . The paper is wide ruled for those who like that configuration . Pages are n't perforated for easy removal , but at this price point it ca n't be expected.This notebook has the SFI , certified sourcing emblem on the cover .	1
I 've ordered several of these Mead Spiral notebooks from Amazon . They are affordable and always ship quickly , arriving in pristine condition . Colors are variable . Nothing out of the ordinary here , just a notebook you could buy at a store , but it 's nice to have it delivered without paying more rather than having to buy it at the store . Another advantage is that you can have them shipped in bulk . I tend to go through a lot of notebooks and I 've been pleased with the service ordering through Amazon . I recommend it .	1
The real deal . This is the actual Scotch brand double stick tape . The vendor sent it out quick . Very pleased .	1
Great tape that I 've been using for years . Not sure what to say except its a great deal for the price and holds up incredibly well . We use it all the time around here for crafts , scrapbooking and more !	1
Ordered this to secure my headphone ear pads . Works well , does the job . There is a protective leader for the first several inches . Tear that off and the rest of the tape is unbacked , double sided with adhesive .	1
I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters . I 'm very happy with how well it works . The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong , so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape . This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250 '' ( 6.3 m ) long , so these are pretty expensive ! Apart from the price , the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect .	1
I have been using this 2 sided-tape for longer than I 'd like to admit . It is a staple , go-to item with so many uses .	1
I just barely missed out on Scotch 's new mounting tape , which more readily can be taken off most surfaces without residue or remnants of its backing.This is essential , for any time you move or otherwise have a reason to take down something from your wall , it leaves a mess that you have to scrub with the abrasive side of a kitchen sponge.Having stated that objection , Scotch 's 1/2 '' Mounting Tape has plenty of uses : It is great for those stubborn posters that refuse to stay up when you refuse to mar your walls with thumb tacks.I 've used this product ( and other sizes as well ) for putting up a simple dry erase board with a cardboard backing . It gives me space to write calendar urgencies upon a wall in an affordable way.It does not ( nor do the instructions imply that it does ) work with heavy pictures or mounting other heavy wall objects.Seeing the improvements made for its newest addition , this old product version will do the trick , but the newest version is most desirable ( particularly for landlords and perfectionistic homeowners ) for changing or taking down mounted products .	1
Cut to the chase . . . this product works well . Only a little dab will do you . If you use too much tape you will have a hard time trying to remove what you put up there on the wall etc . You only need a small quantity to do a great job of holding something to a clean surface . I highly recommend this and most all 3 M products .	1
Perfect size for hanging lightweight objects . 1/2 '' wide and just 1/16 '' thick , this is ideal for office projects like securing whiteboards or wall-mounted file pockets ( like these : Rubbermaid Three-Pocket File Folder Organizer , Plastic , 13 x 3.5 x 11.5 Inches , Clear ( 96050ROS ) . No more cutting chunky doublestick tape down to size : this is neat , clean , and easy . Rated to hold up to 2 pounds .	1
This mounting tape works very well to walls or smooth surfaces.It can hold posters , post cards and other not too heavy papers and decorations.Scotch is a good reputable name whose products are good quality and reliable.This tape is another fine dependable product .	1
The other day I needed to mount a paper towel holder in my kitchen . I have had a hard time in the past trying to drill into our kitchen cupboards , so I used this tape instead . I was only able to use 2 small pieces about 1 inch each in length . It has now been up all week ! I am impressed . Most of the time I usually thing that tape is just tape and I 've had mixed experiences with tape of this type . But , with this tape I am pleased !	1
This stuff works really well . I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately , I ca n't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later ) . For temporary items , I use the temporary `` command '' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage . This product is supposed to be permanent , so there is no guarantee it wo n't damage your walls . I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer .	1
This can come in handy for different home projects and decorating . For example , I decorated a huge bathroom mirror with small framed pictures using this double sided tape , it looked great . Perfect when you ca n't or do n't want to ruin a wall with a nail . I also decorated the ceramic tile backsplash in the kitchen with the same sort of small framed pictures . The tape is not too hard to remove from the glass/mirror/tile surfaces but expect some difficulty when removing from painted walls . A little sanding of the residue is needed .	1
I have glassed and framed art on my walls that were mounted using this tape and have been holding fast for six years . It is an excellent product that does exactly what it says . Be aware that its use should be considered permanent . I have not found anything that will removed the remnants of adhesive and foam from either the wall or the mounted item when I 've re-located or removed whatever the tape is holding up .	1
Use brand names for tape . Do not skimp.I am a cheap skate but I offer this advice from experience .	1
I used this product to hang large posters on my workplace walls for a party . It holds well even on textured surfaces and comes off cleanly . Best of all , I was able to remove the foam tape from the posters without tearing them so I could store gem for use in hue future .	1
Its tape !	1
I have n't used this a lot yet , but , based on my fairly small sample of experience , this product is a lot stronger than other mounting tape I 've tried . We used it putting up posters at a fundraising event and it did an outstanding job - even on a brick wall . It gripped the wall and the posters very well . It did n't take a great deal of length to hold bulky and moderately heavy posters . Pretty much exactly what you 're looking for from a product like this .	1
While the mounting of objects on walls is a great use for double-sided tape , its unintended uses are also very practical.Being able to `` test-fit '' components with this type of tape before final ( glued ) assembly is particularly handy . Just be aware that the tape can pull off the top surface of any `` layered '' material.You can attach a fairly heavy object anywhere you want on a smooth , strong surface . An open-end wrench from a `` Model-T '' is currently attached to my toolbox fascia , strictly for aesthetic purposes.Most often , I use it for securing small rubber feet/pads at the bottom of items that live on tabletops , as well as securing shims of wood , cork , plastic , cardboard , metal , rubber , etc . onto the bottom of uneven items.If you need to re-attach or re-orient an object that had a single-use , `` peel-off '' sticky surface originally applied , this tape is your friend . The most common usage in that category is the `` deer whistles '' re-attachment on my car 's front bumper . I always seem to find them on the ground where I park . Take the time to remove any residual gunk with a Goo-Gone/Dissolve-it -like solvent , and then some alcohol to get rid of any oily film , first.Just appreciate that this tape is permanent in the sense that disassembling the pieces it connects may damage them . You need to `` pry '' things off very slowly and carefully . It is also almost structural at the scale of flimsy plastic components , which seems to describe most objects these days.There is another variant - `` Heavy Duty '' double-sided tape ( colored red , rather than white ) for more massive items and those that you 'd prefer to not ever come loose . It works almost like an epoxy . I used some most recently for attaching a rubber/foam door seal ( intended for a garage door 's bottom edge ) as a threshold on a tile floor - 1 year on and it 's still holding.Also , do n't throw the packaging away , since it lists the strength of the adhesive , which is very convenient when you want to calculate how much to use . 1 '' wide tape is also available.This product is an indispensable item in my toolbox/fabrication drawer . I do n't use much , but even a small piece is oftentimes invaluable .	1
Scotch is the brand I usually buy when looking for tapes . I have bought the two sided tapes for years now , for both business and personal needs . The early lesson I learned was to make doubly sure that you mount to a surface where you wo n't want to remove the item from later . If you mount a picture to a painted wall , for example , and then remove it the paint will most likely comme off with the tape . This tape here is clearly called `` Permanent '' for good reason .	1
I use this tape for attaching to surfaces that are not smooth ... like the dash of my car or the fabric on my cub wall ... so far it is a permanent hold and appears to want to stay that way . But please keep in mind that this is a permanent adhesive . Removal of this tape at best will leave a difficult to reove residue . Mlre often it will damage the surface ... permanet implies forever , so if you use it in that manner you will be satisfied .	1
I perhaps have a strange use for this product . I have a size 9 1/2 foot , and it 's wider than most shoes of that size at a 5E . Add to that , my size makes it difficult to tie shoes directly , so I tie them before I put them on , and use a shoe horn . The problem is the tongue of the shoe can get pushed into the shoe , slipping it on this way , and then the fit is wrong . I 've tried to tie the strings to keep the tongue in place , but this had mixed benefits . I decided to try this two-sided tape , and it works great . I cut about two , one inch pieces , put them on the top of the tongue , and stuck them to the shoe top from within . The stick works pretty well and so I no longer have the problem.I believe the sticking power will also work in hanging some of my anime posters that tend to come down with regular tape . I might try this on some hooks as well , but I believe 3M has a better product for that application . This is not going to be much use for a carpet , windows , or larger applications , you do n't get a lot of tape in the roll , and it 's white , not clear , so unless hidden behind the use , you can see it . All in all though a good product , I 'll definately want to get some more .	1
I remember learning , back in 1st or 2nd grade , how to make standard scotch tape in to double sided tape by just making a loop . That lesson is probably the most-used lesson from that time in my life and I still use that trick on a somewhat regular basis . Scotch Mounting Tape steps things up a couple of notches . Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk , hand a couple of light pictures , and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It 's light , inexpensive , durable and is handy to have around .	1
Easy to use mounting tape - easy to cut to exact size . I 've used it to mount my wireless router to the wall and it 's been holding up for three months with no problems . I 'll update if it falls , but so far , so good .	1
Used for the right applications , this is a great product . I would n't use it for mounting anything where a nail or screw is the usual holder , though . This is just great for very lightweight objects or for holding heavier objects steady ( where the tape is not actually supporting the *weight* of the object ) . For example , I have a heavy mirror mounted to my bedroom door by over-the-door hooks . Every time the door was closed , the mirror would swing behind , clapping against the door when it stopped . But by putting a square of Scotch 's `` mounting tape '' behind each corner , the mirror stays firmly against the door ( even with raucous kids running in and out ) . The great thing about this tape is that the foam layer helps compensate for a small amount of surface irregularity on the object or mounting surface.The package directions specify to use four inches of tape for each half pound of object weight , to a maximum of two pounds . For heavier applications , consider using Scotch'sexterior mounting tape , which is rated at being able to hold up to five pounds.For best adhesion and performance , really mash the tape in well , smoothing it all over , then apply very firm pressure against the mounted object over each point where you applied tape . Consider cleaning the wall with alcohol before applying tape to remove any oily residue from household cooking ( even if it 's not in the kitchen ) .	1
Works absolutely great for hanging all sorts of things on the wall . I 'll be concerned if I have to remove it at a later period , but for now , everything I put up remains there . It 's truly a a wonderful product , and great to have on hand .	1
3M 's Scotch is THE brand to look for all your mounting needs . I 've used their mounting sprays , `` invisible '' tape , and for commercial applications ( mounting permanent signs ) with their 3M VHB foam tape . Each serves its unique purpose.For this tape , its ideal for posters , plaques , signs , and some lightweight picture frames . When mounting an item , you can remove/reposition ( for perfectionists like me , this is a huge plus ! ) . Let it sit for a while and it becomes more permanent . Keep in mind that this is just foam tape , and not ideal for holding very heavy items . 3M recommends that the items you mount not exceed 2 lbs . If you need to mount something heavier , and more permanent , consider 3M 's VHB ( very high bond ) tape ( which is also very expensive ! ) , or silicone caulking ( can be found at most home improvement stores ) .	1
This is a useful item to have in the household drawer . Just do n't expect it to hold anything on a wall other than very lightweight items ( like paper ) . The adhesive just is n't very strong .	1
This mounting tape ( double-sided ) is very strong . I was able to hang a mid-size picture frame or a clock using this and is still standing fine for more than a month now . However , be cautious about the paint - some paint layers can rip due to the weight . Depending on the paint and number of layers you have , you may have to scrap some paint off before hanging things using this tape .	1
This is useful and highly adhesive mounting tape that can be used for a number of applications . I found it useful for mounting posters , but it has a number of other applications as well . It offers a good amount for the price .	1
This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items , but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it . For heavier items , I put more on the back of the wall hanging , or object , and on lighter items I use less . Also , it really sticks to ceramic , even if it has a glossy glaze ! Some mounting tape is not gon na stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use , but with this product , only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop . Midstream , I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement , and it was easy to lift them off the wall , without tearing the paint , and move them . ( I think when dry , and `` set '' they might not be so easy to move , because the tape is so sticky , so we 'll see . ) Excellent , effective , and easy to use product ! Recommended .	1
I 've purchased a wider version of this tape to re-affix a soap/shampoo dispenser in the shower . It worked well even in that damp environment , loosing only after 2 years.This narrower size is proving very handy around the office . For example , I needed to to attach an incoming mail container on the edge of my bookcase , and this tape worked perfectly.Not much else to say . The tape is handy and easy to cut for custom fits ; the protective paper peels off easily !	1
I have used this product in both in the tape and squares form for many years . I live in California where we get many little earthquakes , and I have grandchildren who occasionally slam doors , so anything hanging on the walls could shift . I ca n't stand having mirrors , pictures , clocks , etc . hanging crooked . I hang the object with a picture-hangar which holds the weight , but always put mounting tape at two corners which holds the frame straight on the wall . This mounting tape is permanent - so place it where you want it to stay . I would never put it on the back of a clock , for instance , if the battery will need changing once a year . I have found it takes patience to remove it from any surface . This product is also useful for mounting on surfaces that can not tolerate a nail or screw hole . Scotch mounting tape is part of my tool box arsenal .	1
There is not too much to say about mounting tape in general , except when it does not meet expectations . This baby does what 's it 's supposed to do , easy to open/place/replace , and you are good to go .	1
This tape works great on the signage I have in my office . The signs are thin sheets of plastic that I have to adhere to wooden doors and cement walls . So far , I 've had no problems using the tape . Recommended .	1
Use it all the time ... to stick things BETTER than regular tape . It has grip and a good hold ... like a stopwatch I have mounted in my gym ... it is always there for me and has stayed up for years now .	1
We use this tape to mount kids ' art work to the refrigerator . It works well and stays on far better than magnets .	1
This tape is proving to be very useful . Thus far , it has held securely . You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall . The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint . If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it , some of the paint may come off . Although I guess you should expect that . It is , after all , permanent tape . All , in all , it delivers on its promise : allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails . And the price is right . I recommend it .	1
If you have something such as a poster , sign , or brochure holder that you 'd like to mount on a wall or other solid surface this is a useful product . The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides . It works best on a smooth surface and is fairly strong ( recommended for holding up to 2 lbs ) . This could be used for a variety of projects where you wish to mount something permanently on a wall . If you 'd rather not nail or screw something into the wall then this is a good alternative - just do n't expect for this tape to come off later without leaving a residue that you 'll need to clean or scrape off . Also , there 's no tape-cutting mechanism on the roll so you 'll need a scissors or utility knife to cut the tape .	1
Works great , but DO NOT put it on any surface that you do n't want it on forever . I 'd suggest not using it on drywall at all ... you can pull it off of harder surfaces and then goo-gone the leftovers , but it just destroys drywall when pulled off . So if you want permanent mounting on a hard surface , I 'd recommend .	1
So far I 've used this double sided foam tape to mount photos and mounted a small clock on glass . It hasgood holding power and rated to hold 2 lbs . It does depend what you mount to , someone stated it wouldn'thold on plaster walls , if the surface you use is weak the tape is n't going to change this fact . I mounted abadge back on a cars painted surface , this tape is strong enough for jobs like this . This is a good generaluse double sided white foam tape , the roll is 1/2 '' wide X 75 '' long , other sizes are offered but I found thisis a good general use size .	1
This is one of those products that most households should keep on hand , stuck in that `` miscellaneous stuff '' drawer along with string , packing tape and whatnot.It 's mainly good for the purposes Scotch mentions : sticking things up on walls . The 1/16 inch thickness of foam allows for irregularities between your wall and what you 're sticking up ; if you try to use regular , non-foamdouble sided tapefor anything more substantial than a sheet of paper , you 're inviting anengineering disaster.This mounting tape can be considered reasonably permanent -- anything that does n't fall down in the first few hours will probably never fall down . But at the same time , it 's semi-removable ; If you ever have to take down whatever you 've stuck up with this stuff , you can usually do so with little or no damage to the object or the wall . If the wall is painted removing the tape will most likely take off the paint in that area too . But for surfaces like tile , plastic or enamel ( i.e . refrigerators ) , a layer of the tape will stay behind , and this can be removed with paint thinner or something likeGoo Gone ( along with a fair amount of elbow grease ) .In short , it 's good stuff to have around .	1
This tape is definitely useful in a lot of ways . Picture hanging ( if it is n't too heavy or fragile ) , securing items to shelves so they do n't get broken , I also used some to keep a shoe holder on my closet shelf from sliding . There are so many ways this can be used , the limit is your imagination . Keep in mind , though , that this is n't like Command strips ... you can ( and probably will ) lose some paint or do damage on finished surfaces when you go to remove it . As long as you 're not worried about it being permanent , I highly recommend it .	1
Scotch 1/2 '' Mounting Tape comes in very handy for many uses . Last week I installed several new devices in my living room home entertainment cabinet . This mounting tape worked great for cord control , routing and organization . I used it to mount a Roku box on the inside of a cabinet sidewall . it is being held firmly and even the pressure from some of the cables and wires trying to push it away from the wall has not sprung it . I also mounted a small antenna amplifier to the back of a flat screen TV . I 'll be curious to see how the heat from the television effects the tape over time . If it 's bad news I 'll let you know . Good Stuff !	1
Love this stuff b/c the adhesive lasts and you do n't need much . Some of my small breakables on shelves are now more earthquake-ready . I also used this to stick onto the back of a notebook , then stuck the notebook on my non-magnetic fridge . Instant shopping list ! Many possible uses . Recommended .	1
I create presentation boards for design presentations and I often find myself needing to affix a piece of marble , tile or carpet to the board . Glue does n't hold and regular tape is a joke . Scotch mounting tape , however , does the job . Normally if I affix a piece of marble it has fallen off of the board by the end of the day - I have marble still sticking to the board weeks later and no signs of letting go . This tape is amazing and , though I ca n't say for sure , it truly seems to be a permanent tape . Highly recommended .	1
I live in an old , old house , and the horsehair plaster in the walls can crack horribly if you hit it with a nail . Up until now , my solution has been to keep anything heavier than a poster off my walls , and posters just are n't exactly grown-up decor.Then I got this mounting tape . It 's permanent , so I was very careful about finding a spot for a piece of lightweight art , a small piece of framed needlepoint . I followed the directions and used plenty of tape , and I wiped down the wall with alcohol before smushing the picture frame onto the wall . It holds perfectly.I 've used a similar Scotch product that was cut into 1 '' squares , and would n't be without it . It holds my precious items onto my plate rail in the dining room , and keeps the photos on the picture rail . This product is even better - because it comes on a roll , it stays cleaner and dispenses more easily.Yet another Scotch product that 's an absolute must in my house . I 'm going to need a drawer dedicated to their products before long ! ( But I wo n't tell anyone , because everyone thinks I 'm weird already )	1
Need something stuck to something else ? This stuff does the trick . I had one of those license plate thingys to put on the front of my car and no bolts to do it . So I whipped out my Scotch Mounting Tape and stuck it on there . It 's been on ever since without even trying to come off . WOO HOO ! It works well in the house too for those small photo frames on the wall . GOOD PRODUCT -- GET IT !	1
Scotch states this is for permanent mounting , but I 'd hold back on that until a year goes by . I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice , in that I do n't have to drive a nail into the wall . But the biggest use I have for Scotch 's ( double sided ) mounting tape is for flat surfaces . Where most people have kids knocking things about , I have little earthquakes but most horrendously , cats ! My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops . I have some glass vases , vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves . I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf . I 've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor . For that peace of mind alone , this tape is worth it . Plus the price is right .	1
Putting objects , other than pictures , on the wall can be daunting . The permanent mounting tape is easy to use and seems to work well so far . Pealing the tape is easy and mounting it is also simple . I also have used it for creating art projects where I want certain items to stick on without the use of messy glue.Of course nails and screws work well for hanging things , but I do n't always want to put more holes in the walls of my house . Holes can be hard to fill and hide even when you paint over the surface . So the tape is simple and can be used on most wall surfaces including tile and wood . It 's difficult to put nails into tile , so this product takes care of that.It 's also handy since it 's a simple roll of tape . I do n't need other equipment and there is no cleaning up . So for that unusual project , I think it 's great to have on hand . The only question is whether it will be easy to remove and clean up if I want to take if off the wall or off the other items .	1
I used these to hang up a big board & they worked . they really serve their purpose & holds up great	1
This mounting tape has worked out well on many different surfaces . It is pretty strong too . I have actually used it to hang smaller/lighter pictures in frames and none have come falling down..yet . There is a good amount of tape in the roll , so you can get a good number of things hung with it . I also used it to hang one of the full length door mirrors on my daughter 's bedroom door . It has held so far so good..and that is even with her slamming the door at times . I am getting pretty brave at using it for larger , heavier items - I just make sure to use a good bit of the tape around all edges , so that it is secure .	1
There are times when flat tape just is n't appropriate . Especially when one ( or both ) surfaces are n't completely smooth or flat . This is what you need . I have some wiremold that holds electrical wires to a baseboard , and when it came time to attach it , I knew exactly that type of tape I needed . The slight `` sponginess '' to the material , forgives any imperfections in the items to be adhered . Regular tape just leaves gaps.It IS difficult to remove , though . The thickness of the material will often result in removing only a layer of it , so be careful where you mount with it . On the other hand , when things do n't stick with regular tape , THIS is what you need . BTW , for wet applications ( and others where I want LESS permanence ) I have used theCommand Adhesivemounting strips . They come inwater-resistant , too . They are only tabs ... so it takes a few to hang things ( while this is a nice long uninterrupted roll where you can choose your own size . ) This is just a product that serves its particular purpose perfectly ! !	1
I have used this on tile , metal , glass and interior walls and all surfaces are compatible with this mounting tape in my experience . I did notice that if the surface is ice cold , make sure you warm the area up with a hairdryer if possible for a better stick . To remove , I slid a razor through the foam core and used Goo Gone to remove the rest of the square , worked great ! I was able to hang a wipe board near my front door than I had been meaning to mount for months , this stuff gets the job done !	1
Used to resecure my pet window seat , still holding up to 14 pound cat , jumping to see the birdies ! I am happy camper , and so is my cat ! Do n't know how good it will withstand 62 pounds of fur yet , but that would n't be the tape 's fault ! : - ) Excellent stuff .	1
I received this product through the Vine program . I had a couple of exit signs to mount ( the light weight flat signs , non lighted ) and did not want to drill holes in the plaster walls to do it . I tried this tape and it works great ! I put tape along each of the sides of the signs and then pressed them in place . Instant mounting and they hold great ! I also tried using this tape to mount a couple of plastic in boxes ( the angled ones designed for wall mounting ) on the side of a file cabinet . It works great and I did not need to drill the cabinet to mount it with . I have placed around 40 sheets of paper ( letter size ) in one of the boxes and filled the other with incoming mail and the tape has held well . Nothing has separated and the installation looks neat.I have not tried removing anything so I can not attest to the ease or difficulty of removing items mounted with this tape . I can say though that as long as what you want to mount does not weigh a lot , this tape works well .	1
There 's not much to say . This is double-sided mounting tape , and it holds tight . It 's easy to apply , and works for most lightweight mounting jobs . It is labeled as `` permanent '' , so I would n't recommend using this on anything you want to eventually remove it from . It 's not coming off without some effort and residue left behind.My only complaint is that it 's a small roll , but that 's to be expected.There 's really no competition . 3M basically invented this sort of thing .	1
There are many applications for this tape , but our favorite is in kids projects . The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other ( making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape ) . The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance ; for example , mounting something inside a remote control vehicle . Also , while this is meant as permanent tape , the foam layer can , in some applications , give you a way to pry off whatever you 've taped . We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing , nailing , sewing , velcroing , etc .	1
Not too much to say here : works great and sticks solid to most surfaces unless they are oily . I used this mounting tape in my classroom for mounting bulletin boards in the room ( as well as to hold in place while silicone glue dried ) and had no problems . Highly recommended .	1
Great product we used it mount all our travel photos above are bed . One helpful hint , be sure to allow the paint to cure for a few weeks , so that it does n't lifts off easily . Also , we found it worked best when you prime the walls before you paint it makes a difference when using mounting tape . The paint and texture do n't come off so easily when you take the tape off later -- which is great . We change out the photos every few months when we go on another trip . We have some photos that have been up for over a year and there is no lift in the corners like you see with other mounting two side tape .	1
We have been using Scotch brand tape products for decades but not , until now , have we used this product . It is difficult to rate it because of infrequent need but on the one occasion we have used it thus far , it did all that we had hoped it would . If the item remains firmly attached after a month or so , I will add a star to my rating . Meanwhile , perhaps other uses will emerge . Tests and evaluations continue.Meanwhile , again , I say `` Thank You '' to the Amazonians for the Vine Program .	1
I mean , not like someone does n't make a dispenser for this stuff . If 3M wanted to , they could probably make anything having to do with adhesion . Probably already have.This double-sided tape is the standard by which others should be judged . Or not , I can not recall ever seeing a competitor to this product , if I did I would not even bother checking it out . How can you improve perfection ? What Scotch 33 is to electrical tape , this mounting tape is to.. everything else . If you have two smooth- or even slightly irregular surfaces needing to be stuck together , here it is . The uses are innumerable . I use it to affix magnets to notepads for refrigerator use . I use it to make model furniture mock-ups while in the design process . I use it to stick co-workers keyboards and mice to their desks when they are away.Awhile back 3M introduced these little gel-like squares that were also double-sided adhesive , and while they would definitely do some things the foam tape would not , they fell far short in sheer versatility.i must admit I prefer the 3/4 '' or 1 '' width , but this is the size generally found in most any type of store . No tool box , drawer or glovebox should be without a roll .	1
This product is excellent for mounting items . It is very sticky and you get a good amount of tape in each package . The price is right too - overall a great buy . Highly recommended .	1
This is an excellent double sided mounting tape for small items . However , you have to make sure the surface you attach it to is absolutely clean . If there is oil , dirt , grease , etc , it is not going to stick for very long . And the surface you attach it to has to be dry and stay dry and it has to be strong enough to hold whatever you are mounting . If the surface has been waxed , it may not stick for very long . All you have to do is clean the area where you are going to use it and it will do an excellent job . This is a light to medium strength mounting tape and should not be subject to heat or vibration . If you want to mount something in your car or boat , there are other very high strength mounting tapes . If you want to mount a small picture or similar then use 4 good sized pieces , one in each corner , do n't use just one in the middle . This mounting tape would be excellent for mounting poster boards .	1
I originally thought to use this product just for scrapbooking and card making , to add dimension . For this it 's wonderful , and easy to use . Small pieces are easy to cut , since both sides of the tape is covered with a protective paper that you remove to expose the adhesive . Remove one side , affix to your `` scrap '' , then remove the remaining paper , and stick everything in place . Easy , holds permanently , and looks good , providing a nice dimensional look . I have an idea or two for some great 3D xmas cards next season.But I also found out that this tape works wonderful to stick up things like cork tiles onto the inside of cupboard doors.. I orginally used UGO squares , which does have the advantage of being removable , but it did NOT stay stuck . After a week or so , the cork tile fell down . I had replaced it with more of the same , and had another failure . So I replaced it with pieces of the Scotch Mounting tape , and it 's still attached . It 's my new go-to craft sticky . : - )	1
So far , I have hung a few things ( nothing too heavy ) and this product works well . It is easy enough to cut and dispense as I need , holds steady and firm , and did not tear the paper I had it affixed to when I went to move it . It moved cleanly and left no marks . Instead of using tacks that leave marks , use this product to stick items to surfaces without destroying the surface or the product you are displaying .	1
Let me just say that 3M is an awesome company ! I have yet to come across any of their products that do not perform as advertised . I recently purchased their Headlight Restoration Kit3M 39008 Headlight Lens Restoration Systemthat is just plain awesome . It worked so well that I find myself looking - proudly , I might add ! - at my headlights on a daily basis . Check out that review in a few days.The Scotch mounting tape is an easy to use double-sided heavy duty foam tape . I have used it successfully for numerous things around the house and garage ... here are a few examples : * School projects where heavier objects were required to be attached to project boards . * Mounting 4x4 ceramic tiles , that our pre-K kids created for father 's day , temporarily to sheet rock - It could have handled the ceramic tiles permanently . * Securing a GPS mount on an automotive dash - I installed away from direct sunlight coz ' nothing holds in sunlight ! * Mounting steel spice boxes on to ceramic tile* Hand towel hooks in the garage and laundryThe only drawback is lack of a dispenser or storage case . The outer wrap does come a little loose and any part of the tape that picks up dust , lint , etc . is unusable .	1
Some reviews of Scotch 1/2 '' Permanent Mounting Tape say that it 's good for photo albums . Maybe , but I do n't think I 'd use it for that , because it 's rather thick : 0.065 '' . Its thickness is n't an issue for other applications , though , such as mounting posters or whatever to a wall.Other reviews say this tape will stick to anything , but really it is designed for smooth surfaces . If you used a lot , maybe you could use it on a cinder block , but it would be better to buy tape designed for that.I was concerned about the `` Permanent '' description . The last thing I wanted was to have to chip old tape off my wall . I did some tests and was happy to discover that permanent here means that it is made to be used once only and that it will last a long time . Removing tape that I 'd stuck to my wall was very easy and caused no damage at all.This is very good tape for affixing items to a wall or other smooth surface .	1
I used this to mount a couple rear view mirrors to my computer monitors at work ( so that people do n't sneak up on me since my back is to the aisle ) and FINALLY I found a product that keeps them attached . I 've tried several different products that do n't seem to last long , but this one appears that it is tough enough to last .	1
Scotch 1/2 inch Mounting Tape is a padded , double sided tape on a 75 inch roll . One side gets applied to an object , and the other side gets pressed against a surface on which you wish to mount your object . The cushion between the adhesive layers gives you flexibility when it comes to mounting objects that do not lie flat against one another.This mounting tape is designed to be permanent and is not repositionable . The user must take care to line up objects carefully when mounting them , and there is no guarantee that the surface of your walls will be completely immune to damage when this is removed . For some items , it might be helpful to mark its desired position before mounting , or use a small level.For some items , mounting tape is an ideal solution . For example , one of my children made an art project on a 36 square inch ceramic tile . There was no way to nail it to a wall , and adhesive hangers with flaps for mounting on picture hooks do n't always hold up to the task . Due to the irregular surface on the back of ceramic tiles , the foam padding is needed to provide the thickness and to allow for irregularities in the surface.As a rule , you should use about a half inch of this tape per ounce of weight . I used 5.5 inches for the ceramic tile , and the bond is as strong as would ever be needed . The package says that it holds up to 2 lbs , which presumably refers to the maximum weight of each object to be mounted . The roll is long enough to support a total of over nine pounds worth of items . Sixty 4 by 6 photographs weigh about nine ounces , so this roll can go a long way.The tape itself comes in a roll with no dispenser and with a single backing strip between layers . Therefore , you ca n't pre-cut a section and hold onto it for later . But you can cut off the amount you need , apply it to an object , and leave the backing layer in place until you are ready to mount your object.There 's nothing new or innovative about this product , but this product is very well suited to its task . It can also be used for a wider variety of tasks , but it might be best to save it for those special tasks for which it outshines other solutions . Although it can replace anything from thumbtacks to picture hooks , thumbtacks are cheaper and this product might be overkill . As double sided padded adhesive tapes go , this one does the job as well as can be expected .	1
If you have items that you want to mount on the wall , but do n't want to drive nails , this is the tape for you . I have used this to put up small pictures in my daughters ' rooms , and it works great . I would n't trust any kind of tape for large pictures , but that is not why you would buy this.One thing to be aware of ... .it 's biggest strength is also somewhat of a weakness . Once you put something on the wall with this tape , it is staying on the wall . It does not remove easily , and thus is not suitable for mounting things you may want to move from time to time ( i.e . posters in a child 's room , wall calendars , etc. ) . They make other kind of lightweight , low adhesion tapes , that might be more suitable for that.Overall ... .great at what it does and recommended .	1
My sunhat was too big , so I got the idea of lining the inside with the mounting tape . It did the trick . Hat no longer falls over my ears . Good for all the other usual uses as well . Handy to have around .	1
We use this around the office . It holds pretty well . It holds a phone headset against the wall . The longer the strip you use the better the strength is . It leaves a slight sticky residue once its removed , but you can get rid of it with some soap and water .	1
This is heavy duty . I use it for everything . I even put up canvas Frames with it . Very easy to use and not to hard to remove .	1
Got this for putting on a plastic cable cord cover to hold in place on the carpet after I had to move it and the original double sided tape came off and would n't stick any longer . This stuff is strong and works well even though it is more meant for smooth surfaces than for what I used it for .	1
Do I need to say more . Scotch is trusted because they make the best adhessive products on the market . Works for me	1
This tape is the answer for many , many needs . It can be used to hold a speaker in place rather than watch it role off a shelf or bureau . It hold computer accessories to the desk . It can be removed without much effort . Need a little goop cleaner . It 's the million use tape that leaves Duct Tape in the DUST !	1
I have used this product for at least ten years . It has never failed me . The sticky sides last and last and last . I use it for a multitude of things . My old 1/2 '' roll was marked by me in 2003 and is still going strong . Great product . I definitley do recommend .	1
This is a strong tape and there is a lot of it for the price . It is a very useful tape to have in your toolbox .	1
I put up a solar light on my brick fence wall in the back yard using this tape . It really holds well and the light as not budged . Saved me from having to drill holes in the wall . Highly recommend .	1
I have these same 3M mounting tapes each with different mounting weight . Used them for many reasons for many years and have not failed me .	1
I bought this thinking it was like the 3M stuff I bought in the past ; clear and very sticky . This tape is a gray color and is not as sticky . I 'm not sure what model tape the clear stuff was but it was great . This tape is still good but not quite as strong as I would like . I bought several rolls to hang some reflective barrier on my garage door . So far it is holding up well with the heat .	1
It 's double sided tape and it does what double sided tape ... with one exception . It is stupid strong ( not sure what stupid strong is , but it sounds good ) and it 's not coming off once you put it on .	1
Good Tape for using outside . I bought it to secure my wireless bell button on the outside of the house .	1
Holds things very well just as you would expect from 3M . I used indoor so can not say much about it working outside .	1
I mounted a clock to my motorcycle with this and it has been on for a few hundred miles . That 's all I need it to do and it was a success .	1
This tape is great for hardware projects requiring a high strength but potentially temporary bond . I have often used it for building mechanical and electrical gadgets as well as for repairs on household items . It has worked well on both flat and irregular surfaces . I would highly recommend the Scotch exterior mounting tape over the foam-based tapes for any project -- indoor or outside as it holds up better under repeated mechanical stress.In one example , I used this tape to affix several one pound lead weights to flight simulator rudder pedals that were ultimately removed . The removal was an arduous process . I found that using a Weller heat gun and hand scraper was the best method . If you are using this mounting tape in situation where it may need to be removed , you might was to check the durability of the surface first as any paint/finish could be damaged .	1
This is the best mounting tape I have ever used and I swear by it ! If I want something to stick on then I will use this tape . This is the gorilla tape of double sided tapes . Perfect , and will adhere to almost any surface you can find , and rather permanently if it is smooth .	1
Here is a re-post of my review for the same product but for 450 '' roll instead of this 60 '' roll . I recommend the 450 '' roll because at the current price , the 450 '' roll is 3 times the price of this 60 '' roll and you get 7.5 times the length of material . A much better value , and if you like it as much as I do ... YOU WILL WANT IT.Scotch Permanent Outdoor Mounting Tape , 1 Inch x 450 Inches ( 4011-LONG ) I call this sticky tape stuff because when I started using it , I found it to be less a double-sided mounting tape and more like a thin sheet of sticky gum . This stuff stretches out to much longer and narrower or can be folded upon itself to be thicker . Sticky stuff.Value : This 450 inch roll is the much better value than the 60 inch roll on the site ( 4 cents per inch versus 10 cents per inch ) .Does it work : I have n't found any type of mounting or double sided tape that comes anywhere near this in sticking ability . I use this in my garage to mount some padded rubber surfaces ( very light ) to a cinder block wall to protect my car doors , through extreme heat and cold , the surface has stuck . I use this to mount a plastic device that attaches hoses to a window ( for an in-room AC unit ) which gets a significant amount of torque from the heavy hoses , absolutely no issue . So , yes , it works.That 's it ... if you are a do-it-yourself'er , this is a must have for your tool kit .	1
These are faily strong outdoor tape . I bought this to hang a sign outside my door and after over a year the sign is still there hanging on to concrete . Good price too .	1
This Belkin Standard Mouse Pad is useful for my spare computer . However , I find that I prefer a smooth surface to a cloth-type surface .	1
It 's a basic , no-frills mouse pad . I.e. , it works . I love it when a product does n't do too much , and mouse pads are notorious for trying to do too much . So thank you , Belkin .	1
It is a cheap simple mouse pad for your mouse . If that is what you are looking for then this is your mouse mat !	1
This is an inexpensive Mouse Pad , but it does it 's job and holds up well for the price . If you are looking for a mouse pad , do n't bother buying the more expensive ones , this one does just fine .	1
Although it is plain , it seems to last forever . And the price is unbelievable ! ! ! I used my first one on my make-up table to & # 34 ; catch & # 34 ; any spills or mascara smudges . The other I will use to replace my current mousepad . I will continue to buy these as I think of other uses for them ! !	1
For a small price this is a basic mouse pad . It does n't smell like roses and it does n't greet you by name when you sit down . It just acts like a mouse pad , presuming that this is just what you want .	1
This Belkin Standard Mouse Pad measures 7-7/8 x 9-7/8 x 3/16 inch thick . It has a fine-textured fabric top and a foam rubber back . It is plain vanilla - there is no picture of cute kittens or puppies but it does the job at a very reasonable price . I recommend it to budget-minded Amazon shoppers .	1
I 've used many different typs of mouse pads with many different kinds on surfaces and I 've always liked the one color darker type cloth pads . The pads with patterns and things printed on them can cause a problem with some laser mice and I 've run into that many times . The back surface is great and the thing I liked best was it was n't to thick . Some pads have a really thick rubber base and that tends to raise the pad a bit to high for me . I have my mouse pad holder mounted to the left side of my KB on a center desk drawer and this pad nicely covers the whole surface and is n't to thick as my old one was . The darker color seems to have helped my tracking too . I 've ordered two more of these , one for another computer 's mouse and a spare . Really like this pad !	1
For me , I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised . This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried ! First , I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad . Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse ( the retractable type ) . The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad . In addition , the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place ( no slipping on my desk -- it stays nicely in place ) .Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost ? Look no further , this is the mouse pad I suggest to you . And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad !	1
What 's not to like about a mouse pad that does its job without eating the mouse ? If you need a pad , try this one .	1
I was so skeptical because of the low price however I decided to go for it . I ordered 5 because I can never find a mouse pad when I need one . Plus stores are way to expensive . These work perfect . They are standard size , very light weight and they stay in place !	1
I needed a few cheap mouse pads and these are great . 94 cents and problems solved . I wish all problems could be solved this easily .	1
NICE FOR THE PRICE . I HAD EARLIER ORDERED A MOUSE PAD FROM AMAZON WHICH STATED IT HAD A CALENDAR ON IT . i THOUGHT IT WAS EMBEDDED IN THE PAD . FOOL THAT I MAY BE . IT WAS NOT . IT WAS PAPERS ALL IN A CALENDAR AND STUCK TO A PIECE OF CARDBOARD . I EVEN PAID SHIPPING . IT SELF DESTROYED AND I COULD NOT RETURN IT . BUT WRITE IT UP I WILL.THIS IS THE REPLACEMNT.UNTIL I FIND ONE I CAN SEE AND FEEL IN A STORE SOMEWHERE THAT HAS A NICE PHOTO ON IT , THIS WILL BE FINE . JUST FINE . I AM HAPPY TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT ADHERES TO THE DESK AND LETS MY MOUSE ROLL FOR A COUPLE OF DOLLARS . IT IS JUST FINE .	1
I spend a lot of time in a chair ( handicapped ) , and my mouse did n't work very well on the fabric . Bought this little guy , and the mouse works perfectly now .	1
Does as I expected for a mouse pad . Is thin , as most mouse pads I see in the stores , but costs a fraction of the cost in the store . Love it .	1
This is a very ordinary mousepad , though the Belkin name at least assures you of decent quality for a mundane yet necessary item . It replaces a dirty , ink-stained , slightly smaller red mouse pad . My 5-star rating includes considerations of pricing and packaging along with Belkin quality . I 've received similar pads that were all rolled up and misshapen so that they would fit into cheap packaging and require less postage . But as a Prime product , this two dollar mouse pad , rest assured , will arrive in a full and firm cardboard box . No unfolding , pressing , or ironing required before you 're able to use it without agitation . The pad , moreover , is sealed in a Belkin cellophane wrap , making it a nice , inexpensive gift for a friend or associate on an otherwise overcast day .	1
Not great , but just fine . It was a great price , so it serves the purpose . I used it in a classroom I teach in that did n't have one . Glad I did n't have to pay too much for it ... no one reimburses us for things like this .	1
Good mouse pad . Mouse glides easily . Was bent when it arrived but has finally straightened out . I do n't really like the thin plastic top but it works fine .	1
This mousepad has a plasticky surface and the mouse glides smoothly and accurately . Definitely recommend . For the price , this one ca n't be beat . I also tried the 3m mousepad which costs more but performs the same as this one .	1
It is indeed blue , flat and provides a stable horizontal surface for a mouse . All for less than $ 2 and without having to suffer the indignity of going inside an Office Depot or Staples . For that reason alone , it would be a bargain at twice the price .	1
Great pad for putting under washer feet to keep washer from vibrating around great price would highly recommend but no for a mouse pad !	1
This is a basic mouse pad . It has no bells and whistles . It functions perfectly and I would buy it again .	1
It 's light , cheap and it gets the job done . I use it with my Logitech M510 mouse and it works great . So much that I 've ordered two -- one for the home , one for the office and my girlfriend got one as well .	1
11-ish bucks . The construction probably would n't hold from textbooks but for eReaders , paper , and smaller books it 'll do the job . I wish I had this throughout HS . Would have made copying things easier .	1
I do n't understand the number of negative reviews ... this product works great . Some reviewers said it 's plastic and breaks easily . Yes , it 's plastic and I suppose you could break it without too much difficulty but it does n't break under normal use . I use mine to hold open textbooks that measure 10 '' x16 '' ( when open ) and are over 500 pages . The book holder works fine in all respects . Specifically , it supports the book without tipping or wobbling as I turn the pages , the pages are prevented from turning by themselves even with a fan blowing on it , I can slide it across my desk without it collapsing and when I 'm done it folds flat for easy storage . One feature I really like is the fact that the tabs that normally hold the pages in place can be folded flat to accommodate very large books ( 700+ pages ) . I do n't know what else I could ask from a product such as this ! I can recommend this product without reservation .	1
Simple product . Does exactly what I need it to . Cant say anything bad about it . Very happy with the purchase .	1
Its a book holder plain and simple . For the price , the product itself is very useful and functional . There are better bookstands out there , but youll have to pay for it	1
This book holder is made of plastic and seems a little flimsy , but so far it 's holding up decently . The back stand uses two pieces , and is adjustable . There are two tabs in the front which you can move forward and backward so that you can turn pages more easily or insert new books without fear of ruining a page . They are also a problem . I have found that they can pop out from use as they only have a fitted notch keeping them in place at the bottom of the unit.I can also see how a book larger than 2 inches in thickness can be an issue , as the depth of the base is roughly an inch deep . I 've not yet had to work with this ( I use it for typing up class notes from notebooks at this time ) with a book of that size , but i can picture my coffee cup coming into play if I ever use it with a book of that size .	1
I 'm really enjoy this book holder . It holds large and small books at various weights . At first I did n't think it would because it 's made out of plastic , but it 's pretty sturdy . Also love the fact that it folds up and can be inserted in a binder for easy transportation .	1
This is a friendly book holder . I use this everyday in my studio . It holds the pages of my books open and can be adjusted to any angle I choose . I 'm thinking about buying another for my cook books in the house . I have to lift the book out of the one in the house to turn the page .	1
This book holder works well even with large books . It can be folded flat for easy storage in a briefcase . It 's an expensive . I would not hesitate to buy another one if I needed it .	1
I 've been using their labels for more than 20 years -- they are SO easy to use on the computer , and these 08167 labels print equally well on my Ink Jet AND laser printer.Feeding them through a copier is a cinch too.These 08167 labels peel easily , the ink impressions are sharp and crisp , in color OR black and white.I have had no problem with the Avery labels ' adhesive longevity in the past -- let 's see how well these 08167 's do -- I would think that they will be just as good as their predecessors .	1
It 's hard to review this type of product . They work , they did not smudge , and they are compatible with word . We also used some to cover up old file labels . They shipped and arrived quickly .	1
Great labels . In the past I have bought other brands and the labels stick to the printer , get jammed up . No smudging , line up nicely and do n't get caught up in my printer - definately a plus ! Avery products are superior in my opinion . A definate buy .	1
On first glance these labels look very small , and they are small , but they are `` Return Address '' labels . While they could be a little bigger , I was able to fit my address on them with a small picture in front of it ( street and apartment number on same line ) . You are realistically only going to be able to fit 3 lines on a label ( at about 8pt font ) , so do n't expect more than that . The labels I printed on my inkjet printer were very clear and the colors looked great . The template allows you to print several styles on a single sheet , which I had printed a few different ones including a small picture to the left of my address and ones with a faded picture in the background . I am using these as both customized return address labels and address correction stickers on my checks ( they are the PERFECT size for that ) . I have only used them on regular envelopes and checks to which they applied easily and did not peel at the edges.The `` Pop-Up Edge '' is a very interesting idea , and is a time-saving way to peel the labels from the sheet . You simply fold the sheet a little along the perforation and the edge of the labels stick out for you to grab.Word of caution : Depending on your printer , the printing may be off center or higher on the label than expected . I 'm almost positive this is my printer because I have had this issue with mailing seals as well , but just wanted to advise others to check this before printing many labels .	1
Love these labels ; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer ( these are made for Ink Jets ) , printing was a SNAP ! I visited the Avery site , downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template # 5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes ( will be a LOT quicker in the future , now that I 've got the template saved to my hard drive ) . Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label ; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use ; the pop-up easy peel feature is great , too : no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet . These peel quickly from the sheet , simply by gently folding the backing slightly . Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet ; highly recommended for EASE OF USE .	1
Works well and does not jam up the printer like other brands can . You can get free templates from the Avery website as well which is a bonus ! I recommend this product !	1
I absolutely love these mailing labels ! They are convenient , and make life so much easier ! These mailing labels are smaller than certain other types of labels ; therefore , more labels will fit on each sheet . And if you use a lot of mailing labels , then that does you a lot of good.They print so quickly and easily . Whenever you need a label , just peel it off . These label sheets save a lot of time and energy , and are so neat.Highly recommended if you use mailing labels.And these are for ink jet printers , which is the type of printer I have at home .	1
I love the easy-peel feature on these labels ! I hate when manicures get ruined on the edges due to trying to peel labels ! I experienced some very minor smudging . The labels adhere well . I definitely recommend this product .	1
I make greeting cards and wanted something smaller than an address label to put on the back of my cards - just my name and web address . These are great for that . Also with some of the humid weather we have been having my older Avery labels would smear if I put them on the cards right away . I have n't had that issue with these yet .	1
We used these to create return addresses on envelopes we sent out to clients . It was much easier and faster than hand writing or printing directly to so many envelopes . Also we were using CD mailers so the printer could n't print onto that anyway . These did n't give us any issues and stuck to the envelopes very well .	1
Just hard to beat the AVERY line of labels . These work great in my two printers and they look great after printing . The glue on the back is first class and they are easy to remove from the sheet .	1
This little labels are really nice . At first , I wondered if I would want to use a label this small and then when I printed a sheet , I realized that these are perfect for use on envelopes , notes , and anything you want to identify . Easy Peel is a great plus here . Avery labels are simply the best and the downloadable templates help those who do n't have one in their word processing application .	1
These Labels are smaller then your Average return address label so you might not get the art on it you might have wanted to use . But they are easy to peel and stick and have found TONS of uses for them since they are small I used them to label DvDs and to organzie my food on the shelf so I will know what is missing .	1
I love Avery labels ! Their free templates are easy to find and download . The labels print flawlessly every time . And they are durable . I really ca n't say enough about these terrific time savers . I design my own return address labels with a family portrait on them , I print out address labels for my holiday cards , and I print larger labels for packages , all with ease ! If you are looking for high quality labels that wo n't let you down , Avery is the way to go ...	1
These are good , but so are other brands , for example 3M . Comparing the two , the Avery look thicker/brighter , but when held up to a light , they look about the same.The adhesive on these and the 3M are about the same , which is to say not very strong , but adequate for a small return address label.The Easy Peel feature makes it convenient to remove from the sheet . But 3M also has this feature.The labels dry quickly and do not smudge.While I can not find anything significantly wrong with these , I also find nothing really outstanding that is not available from other brands.In the end , I would probably go with whichever is cheaper and/or you can get with free shipping .	1
These work fine . Like every label sheet I find it takes a little working out a template depending on what program you 're starting with . My only wish is that these were a little larger so that the type could be bigger . Closer in size to some of the labels often sent out in the mail by organizations as fund raisers . But overall these work well .	1
You 'd think address labels would be a standard product by now , but Avery has added several new features that make this product an excellent purchase , especially if you have a color inkjet printer:1 ) Smudge Free2 ) Jam Free3 ) Pop-up Edge for easy peeling4 ) Squeezes 80 labels x 25 sheets in one package = 2000 address labels ! But here is the best feature of all : by going to [ ... ] and selecting templates for product number 8167 , you get many designs in Word , all ready to go . You can customize the provided logos and/or fonts of course . This saves a lot of time setting your mailing project up !	1
I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive , but I 'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels ! They 're so easy to use , just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila , you 'll have instant return address labels ! I did n't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned , and my favorite part was the fact that they do n't smear ! They 're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope , box , etc . With all the ebay shipping I do , these have come quite in handy.Great product , highly recommend !	1
I was worried that these labels might peel off in my printer and jam it up . They stayed affixed firmly to the backing sheet and yet were not hard to peel off for use . Note these are RETURN address labels , so they are quite small . If you have more than a 3 line address , the printing can get very tiny . At least you get a lot per page and per package.Avery always has templates for all their labels and they are easy to get to , but they always seem to want your name and e-mail address before they will let you get to the template . I would imagine they want to send you advertising.Avery is the best quality and I would encourage you to always buy them , even if they are slightly more expensive . The bargain brands just do n't always work as well . I have had Avery labels on the shelf for years that still work well . Some of the bargain brands can dry up and come loose sooner . Avery apparently knows labels very well and the label business .	1
I really liked the `` Pop-up Edge for fast peeling . The labels are smaller than I am used to using , however our address printed clearly and completely with no problems . I found the labels also nice to stick inside books I loan out , recipe cards and I carry a few in my purse .	1
These 1/2 '' x 1 3/4 inch labels are good for return address labels , but can be useful in so many other places as well . Perfect for labeling a folder that contains multiple topics ( like listing surnames in genealogy research ) or in drawing attention to a particular fact on a picture postcard for marketing purposes . I like the 1/2 '' height ... .up to now I had to settle for 2/3 '' in the width I needed and that did n't fit just right . These are perfect . The `` easy peel '' factor makes it easy to peel the label off the page by simply bending the label edge and it pops right up . Best of all the template for this label page is clearly defined and actually in my offerings choices for my HP four-in-one printer ( I find more and more often that the newer sized labels are n't in my selections and I have to download the template before printing . ) These are easy to print and so far have n't smudged or jammed.Avery Easy Peel Return Address Labels for Inkjet Printers , 0.5 x 1.75 Inches , White , Pack of 2000 ( 08167 )	1
Part of my business is printing lots and lots of address labels ; for myself as well as for customers . Avery has never let me down . This product , the Easy peel , is superior to every other type I have tried . Not only are they easy to remove , but they stick to the envelop or package better than the cheaper brands . You might think saving a dollar and buying the office brand is a good idea , but those things come off in the mail . My Avery labels ride all the way to their destination . They also hold ink well ( I put artwork on them as part of my business ) .Recommended for commercial and residential use.Ellen C Maze	1
No other way to get so many return labels for such a low price . Can print using your choice of fonts and colors . They are small , so perfect for any size envelope . They are also good to use when filling out raffle tickets . Just print up a sheet with name and phone number . Highly recommend for cost and easy of use . Not much else to say about a return label . Good buy .	1
They work as advertised . Great quality and easy to use . I can find no fault with them at all . Make sure this is the size label you want before purchasing and I think you 'll be very satisfied .	1
These labels are designed for inkjet printers often found on desktops . The inkjet priter compatibility is just a coating on the paper that ensures the ink does not wick out and become unreadable in fine fonts.Return address labels have many convenient uses besides their obvious use . With one line of print down the center , they can be used on CD jewell cases down the spine to form a library system with title and index number for CD changers or ipod lists to data backups and storage libraries.In product design and prototyping we often use this smaller label to print at the far end with the print running vertically with 1 or 2 tiny lines of type , then roll them around wires with only that last part showing . As designs shrink the smaller labels are very helpful.Avery provides full product support with templates in ms-word format that make printing on a particular label exceptionally easy if your equipment is calibrated with the right drivers .	1
This is a set of return address labels designed for inkjet printer use ( no guarantee that it will come out as intended with a laser printer , but it can likely be used in a laser printer if needed ) . Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions , using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software . Just print and peel and stick the label on your envelope . This way you can design your own personalized return address labels . My only suggestion for improving Avery 's labels would be to reduce retail prices on them so more people would think of making their own labels .	1
Avery has always provided me with good products and this time is no different . I think that is the strongest feature - consistency.I like the pop-up edge which aide in removing the labels from the sheet stock . These feed fine into my Canon printer and are easy to set up with standard software templates . No issues here ; good stuff .	1
These address labels are easy to use , but they are very small . Had to use 9 pt font to fit the address in the label . Definitely could not add a picture or graphic to the label because there is n't room . Easy to peel and economical because so many fit on a page .	1
I ca n't imagine every buying a printable label that WAS N'T made by Avery . They are like the mafia of paper products . I have been using all of their printable labels for years and years now . Their online support for templates and ideas are just the best.-This is their latest creation : The bendable address label thing . I do n't get it - I mean I see what they 're trying to do but I think it 's kinda lame . They work fine - I found the template online and printed up a bunch of address labels using my laserjet printer . No jamming or anything - prints fine . With this `` new '' design , there 's a crease or cut in the backing behind the labels along one edge of them which allows you to bend the paper to allow for easy peeling . But to me - it 's no different than peeling it normally . It says you can `` bend it back to flat '' after you take a label - but so what - you could do that before anyhow . Plus , with this new design , trying to take ONE label off causes 2 others to peel off a little - and when you lie it flat , they still stick up a little . I hate that . I hate taking a label off even a little bit because then it will lose it 's sticky-ness sitting there in a drawer until I use it next.-If you REALLY have trouble peeling off labels , then get this . Otherwise , do n't bother .	1
These return address labels are great and really helped me out this Christmas when I had to send out all my Christmas cards . I can customize them on what season and holiday it is , or just change it up when I want something a little different for my outgoing mail . Will get these again !	1
I 'm a big fan of printing my own return address labels and these are the best ones so far.I went to the Avery website for the free templates and using Microsoft Word , I printed the best labels I 've ever printed & it was faster and more accurate than it 's ever been.The labels themselves are are the best I 've seen so far , you just bend the sheet at the column and the edge of the label pops up so you can peel it off , so much easier than in the past.The reason these are my favorite labels is because they are 1/2 an inch tall and 1 3/4 inch long and are perfect for putting on printed return forms instead of trying to fit my clumsy handwriting in the tiny writing space.I really like these ... They 're Great !	1
I always like to use the Avery brand for my office supplies and these easy peel return address labels are exactly that . They are easy to peel off and you get a perfect label every time that actually sticks to the envelope and becomes part of the envelope as well . Reccommend highly .	1
I 've been using Avery address labels for more than 10 years now . This newer easy peel is great . Very happy with the ease of use and quality !	1
I usually love all Avery products and I must say that I 'm adding this product to my favorites as well . These labels printed out well and I had no smearing when I applied them to my mailing envelopes . Also , what I loved about them that it was n't hard to peel and reposition them on the envelope once it caught . The color blended nicely with my white evenlopes so well , that it appeared as if I printed the address on the envelope itself . I love these labels ! From now on , I 'll be buying these instead of the store brand I always buy .	1
FIrst , before you order these , pay attention to the dimensions listed in the description . These are RETURN address labels -- the small ones you stick in the corner of the envelope -- NOT the usually-larger address labels that contain the address where you want your letter to go . They are , therefore , SMALLER than address labels . Do n't order these expecting to get larger labels . : - ) That said , these are excellent quality , print easily in my inkjet printer , and , as the package says , are easy to peel off the backing sheet . I used one of the templates I got from the Avery website ( I 'm on a Mac , using Microsoft Word for the Mac ) , and designed some nice-looking labels . Do n't expect to fit more than 3 lines of small print on each label . Like I said , these are small .	1
These Avery Easy Peel Return Address labels worked perfectly for me . The software that you can download from Avery 's website installed easily into my mid level Windows 7 machine and was self explanatory to use . Within a few short minutes I was cranking out my own custom labels with no problems at all.Believe it or not these are the first labels I have ever made myself . I use a middle of the road HP 4680 printer and they fed into the machine perfectly , never jamming and printed exactly right . The labels peel off very easily and as advertised they do NOT smear which was something I had wondered about.I honestly ca n't see why I would need anything else . They ARE a bit small but these are sold as RETURN address labels and are appropriately sized so bear that in mind . Reasonably priced as well .	1
The high quality of Avery products is once again found in these Easy Peel Return Address Labels for use with ink jet printers.The labels peel off easily and quickly with only a slight flexion of the carrier sheet material . In fact , due to the design , flexion of the carrier sheet is really no longer necessary.The fast , easy peel feature is achieved by stripping off the extra surrounding waste label paper that is between the labels . This leaves the labels as free-standing units on the carrier sheet.For anyone who has ever had to put labels on a number of letters , this saves substantial time and mess . Other brands really have some catching up to do !	1
I get a little nervous , whenever I try to use a `` print it yourself '' anything because the templates that they offer often seem to produce slightly off-kilter results . That 's made worse whenever the output in question is small like a return address label . You know what I 'm talking about , the first 8 or so rows print fine and then the text starts to creep off of one label onto the next . You end up with half a page of usable labels and half a a page destined for the recycle bin.Printing the Avery Easy Peel Return Address Labels was a SUCCESS ! I was n't surprised by the ease of peeling them off the backing , nor was I surprised by the fact that the inkjet-friendly paper was virtually smudge-proof fresh out of the printer . That 's Avery and they do that very well.The pleasant surprise was that I did n't need to create my own template to print the labels . Now I do n't have to use the multitude of free charity labels that routinely mispell my name and such .	1
I use the website to create my labels , works great . When using the website they always print correctly on the labels and I can add designs for different occasions .	1
I design labels for my classroom library books and do n't want to worry that the labels will smudge or begin to peel off after a while . No worries . These do n't . Also , they do n't jam in my printer or print out of alignment - yay ! I hate wasting color ink on misaligned labels . I also like how they make application easier due to the pop up feature .	1
I really like the size of these . I hate wasting a bigger label ( like an Avery 5160 ) for return addresses and have even cut them in half sometimes . These are nice because they are smaller . I would have liked them slightly shorter but a touch wider . Mostly because I usually have 3 lines , and it -just- fits . I do n't want to use 7pt fonts , either . My text also bled off the top edge on the bottom 5 rows of the sheet a few times . I know my printer is n't perfect everytime it draws a page through , so I realize it is n't completely the product 's fault . I use a laser printer , I do n't think it matters much that they say `` inkjet '' ... maybe using a laser product in an inkjet might smear , but I never had a problem the other way around . I suppose I can fool around with the margining setup for the label template to alleviate the text `` drift . `` I do like the easy peel and not having to pick at the corners of labels to get them off . I have always liked the quality of Avery labels , and these did not disappoint me . I would get these again .	1
One may think that these labels are not needed , that you can just jot down your return address when mailing items . This is true , but if you mail items a lot , these are great to increase your speed in getting things in the mailbox before the mailman picks up . Also , they come in handy for many non-mail related reasons.EASE OF USE : I made labels quickly with these , the template is available on their website and is very easy to use.VALUE : You can make a lot of labels on just one sheet . If you usually order custom labels , these are much cheaper . If you usually address items by hand , using these are much quicker . They save you time and money.PERFORMANCE : The paper grabs the ink well and does not feather during printing , nor does it smear when you press them smooth with your finger onto an envelope . They stick very well to letters and boxes . Also , they do n't get jammed in the printer.APPEARANCE : Looks sharp and crisp.ADDITIONAL USES : We have a TON of books and loan them out often , putting one of these on the inside cover corner lets our friends know what books to return to whom . Also good to put on the bottom of potluck dishes that get left behind , car key fobs for when you hand the mechanic your keys and on kids toys that go to friends houses with your little ones , just make sure your child is past the stage of trying to chew everything to avoid a choking risk.RATING : A+ , highly recommend !	1
I used these labels to print some return address labels . All in all they came out great , but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right ! I 'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels , but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label . All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit , saved the template , and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the `` Easy Peel '' and it works pretty decently . I 'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I 'm so happy that I do n't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore !	1
I received both Avery # 8167 and # 5267 to review . Since they are identical ( same specs and template number ) but one is designed for an inkjet printer ( 8167 ) and one is for a laser printer ( 5267 ) , I 'll be posting the same review for both items.These Labels are designed with a `` Pop Up '' Edge . This means that you bend the sheet at the side and the labels you want literally pop up an exposed edge so you can grab them easily . Then you fold the sheet flat again . As with most labels , you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels . In my experience , each subsequent use of a partial sheet runs a greater risk of a jam though . I 'm sure Avery 's `` jam free guarantee '' would only apply to a print of a full page.These smaller size labels would also be useful for other applications-such as price tags at a garage sale ... I 've never found Avery to be anything but top of the line and this product is no exception .	1
I was n't sure I needed nor wanted the easy peel feature . However , after mass labeling with more than 300 labels , I find the utility in its design . It 's only useful when labeling large numbers of envelopes at once ; but I appreciated the convenience of having all the labels out and ready to go , not having to struggle to dig my nail under each on.My initial impression was that these labels were too small . They are large enough to fit the average name and address on three lines in Times New Roman 8 point type . They do n't fit a fourth line , even when I tried changing to different typefaces . If you need four lines , do n't buy this.After using the labels , I found the size is actually appealing for my taste . They are clean and simple and look appropriate on letter and business envelopes . Larger envelopes or packages may need a more substantial size label . Companies that want their label to stand out more may also opt for a larger size .	1
Having moved recently , I needed some new address labels . I had always ordered address labels from those mail in label companies . This is the first time I tried my own . So did I think it was worth it ? DEFINITELY ! ! ! I can print sheet after sheet with a variety of pictures ; I can change my pictures after a couple of months to reflect holidays , seasons , you name it ! The only complaint I have is that I would probably choose a bit larger size ... these were a little small . I used Avery 's online printing program and it worked pretty good ... not perfectly lined up , but after I adjusted it , it was fine . For the price , you simply can not beat it . Highly recommend ! ! ! !	1
Avery sets the standard where it comes to address labels so this is a win-win purchase to consider . Get them . There are many address label companies but Avery is a home run every time , no matter what size label or need . Get them .	1
I recently received these and finally had a chance to use them . I downloaded the template wizard for WORD and opened the program to quickly design and print out a sheet of labels . I 'm really pleased with how easy it all worked . Saves on the cost of ordering labels via a third party company .	1
Unlike other return address labels , these Avery labels have an innovative `` easy peel '' feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge . It 's so well designed , you wonder why nobody thought of this sooner.Designed specifically for inkjet printers , these labels print crisply , dry quickly , and avoid smudging.As many have noted , the small size of these labels does n't leave much room for error on your printing software / printer driver / margin settings . You 'll want to use the Avery template 5167 ( free download from Avery , built into most other software including Microsoft Word ) to start . Print a few sample pages on regular paper using your software and printer settings . Hold it up to the light with a blank label sheet in front to make any fine adjustments to margins.Note - the small size of these labels is n't for everyone - there 's not much room for a custom graphic or logo . But that 's why Avery offers multiple product choices !	1
I find the Avery labels the easiest to use . Every software package I 've ever attempted has the Avery Label templates already built in , and the labels peel off easily , and stay stuck to the envelope during mailing.I like to use the Return Address size labels for many different uses : pricing items for a garage sale , file folders ( yes , they make file folder labels , but I 'm frugal ) , labeling books and DVDs , and I also would use them if sending bottles/baby items to a daycare facility.I am a very frugal shopper , but when it comes to labels I feel Avery 's quality justifies the price . I would recommend Avery brand labels to anyone !	1
These are very high quality Return Address labels that can be printed with an Inkjet printer . I printed mine using a Lexmark X3350 . There were no problems with the label sheet feeding through the printer . The labels hold the ink without smearing or blurring or bleeding . Furthermore , no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer - a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels . Yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it 's time to apply them.I strongly recommend that you investigate the `` Design and Print Online '' feature available on Avery 's website . It is far more flexible than a simple template and you can save your layout for future use . The interface is a little strange and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways , but you 'll easily enough get the hang of it with a bit of experimentation ( and it has an `` Undo '' ) . I printed my first try on plain paper and then overlaid it on the label sheet to double check.I see that several of the reviews here criticize these for being unable to accommodate a 4-line return address . Using Avery 's `` Design and Print Online '' you most certainly can create 4-line labels as follows : Find and start `` Design and Print Online '' on Avery 's website . Enter the product number ( 8167 ) when prompted . Hit Next . Select the design you like ( there are many to choose from ) . Important : select `` Enhanced Editing . '' Hit Next . Select a 7-point font . Important : you want a fine , gracile font like Garamond . Enter the first 3 lines of your address in the text box and hit Return after the 3rd line . The Text Entry box will expand downward to fit a 4th line . Enter your 4th line text . Click outside the text-entry box and then position your cursor over the box and click once so you get the 4-way arrow that lets you move the entire text-entry box . Re-center vertically . You 're done . Print and/or Save.Now , a 7-point font is kind of small . Your mail carrier will need his or her reading glasses . If your decision whether or not to purchase these is dependent on being able to do this , then you should try printing some 4-line , 7-point labels on plain paper and using Avery 's website to verify that you like the way they look . It might be better to just go for a larger label . The point is , you can do 4 lines in a half inch with these if you want.The package contains 25 sheets of labels with 80 labels per sheet for a total of 2000 labels . If you are an individual rather than a business , that should keep you in labels until the year 2129.These work well and , combined with Avery 's website , will allow you to create professional-looking , customized Return Address Labels so you can stop using the cheesy ones that your Insurance Agent sends you every Christmas .	1
I received these Return Address labels shortly after I joined the Vine Review program . I was interested to see if they would function as the package promised and they have ! Unlike other labels , I did n't have to struggle and swear while peeling them off the page to place on an envelope . I 'm looking forward to obtaining more when this package runs out .	1
I get a lot of labels from Avery . I absolutely love that they make these return address labels so densely-packed and easy to peel . I can design my own return address label , use MS Word with an Avery template to print them out on my Inkjet printer , and have a whole sheet ( or more ) of them ready to use whenever I need them . No more ordering them from printing companies and then dealing with it when they screw it up or misspell something . With the Avery labels , I have total control over the way my return address label looks.As usual , with Avery you get quality labels that are reasonably price , come in a great arrangement , and have a strong adhesive on them . They work great for letters ( snail mail ) but are also useful for other things like labeling boxes or putting nameplates on your belongings at work ( `` This is MY manual , darn it ! '' ) I mean , really , these are just blank sticker arranged in a template-friendly layout . What you do with them is up to your imagination . You do n't need to use them as return address labels at all ... I 'm sure you 'll find something that needs a label on it , and these do the trick.What more is there to say ? If you need labels , these are the best !	1
These Avery return address labels are your normal , cute size labels . They hold well but are not the type that is industrial strength strong . It is possible to peel them off but they do not peel off as easily as repositionable labels.If you make your own return address labels , this is probably one of the most essential sizes of labels you will use . I also like to use this size for making small labels for dating things I put in the freezer .	1
They print great with no jams in my printer . Easy to peal plus they stick very well to the packages I 'm mailing . Avery definatly has a winner here with this product .	1
Very easy to peel , just crease a 3rd section at a time and the edge of the label pops up . Prints nicely , and looks good . Appears to stick very well , and are not removable , so be sure you have the placement correct before sticking .	1
These are general use return address/locate labels . .5 inch by 1.75 . I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers , so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website . And , of course , Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning , so you can not loose buying these .	1
Way to go Avery . All your products I 've purchased and used thus far are top quality , do n't get stuck in my printer and adheres to the paper .	1
These are the perfect labels for what they 're intended for : return addresses . They are small . I did n't use them for mail merge or for different addresses . However they were perfect for making standard return labels with plenty of room for my address and a small logo . They printed without jamming , no errors , and smug free results . Printed hundreds of these for the holidays . Worked great . MS Word found the template without any problem .	1
These are the size of those commercial address labels that you can order off of those inserts from Sunday newspapers . An A4 size paper has four columns of these labels . Three lines of text in font size 8 , the smallest you can read without a magnifying glass , will fit on this label . So if your address has four lines , these wo n't work for you.They are not entirely removable because some adhesive comes off and then they do not stick as well the second time . Microsoft Word has templates for Avery size 8167 and 5167 and you can find other templates at Microsoft Office Online web site . Free software download is also available at Avery web site.I use them as return address labels and also to label electronic equipment like cell phone , iPad etc with name , email address and phone number in three lines of size 8 font . You can find other similar uses . They work well in laser printers too.The price of these address labels keeps changing but as of August 2010,3M Permanent Adhesive Return Address Labels , 1/2 '' X 1 3/4 '' Inches White , Laser , 2000 labels per pack ( 3100-Q ) ,3M Return Address Labels , White , 1/2-inch x 1 3/4-inch , 10 Sheets per Pack ( 3300-R ) ( 800 total labels ) are a littles less expensive . The real competition are the preprinted address labels from inserts in Sunday newspaper which come out far less expensive than these but then you can not print them at your whim or personalize them .	1
I have had bad experiences with `` generic '' printable labels in the past ... namely , with the sheet getting stuck in my printer . So far , I have had no problems at all with these labels , or any other Avery brand labels . They go through the printer smoothly . The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.Before purchasing , check the dimensions of the labels . These particular ones are very small , but in turn you get more in the package.These work great as address labels , but I find other uses for them as well . When I have pictures taken of my children , I 've always written the name and date on the back of the photo before giving them to family . This can get tedious when you are dealing with 40-50 photos to write on . Now , I print out the relevant information on an address label , and affix that to the back of the photo.If you go online to the Avery website , there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking .	1
All around great company to buy any kind of paper product and after you buy it , they make sure that you buy some more because they have an online software suite that allows you to design and print the label and all of there other design-able paper products , I would give more stars if I could !	1
These labels are of great quality . No issues with avery design wizard of course . Not a cheap label . Good adhesive , nice heavy paper .	1
It might seem silly to be excited about labels but I am . I 've been looking for labels that are n't a pain in the you-know-what and I 've found them.These labels are return address label sized ( 80/sheet ) . I 'll be using them for that as well but my initial use is for `` reorder '' labels on products I sell . The printing is clear and smudge-proof , important for labels with small print that might be exposed to liquids or creams.What I like best about these is the Easy Peel feature , which will save much time and aggravation when I 'm label several items ( or envelopes ) at once . I 'll be ordering these again but with 80 labels per sheet , it may be a while .	1
These are quality labels that yield a professional look . They also have a perforated backing paper that bends , making them easier to remove from the sheets . If you 're looking for a really small no-nonsense label that sells with plenty in a pack , this product might be for you.However , I personally feel they 're a little too small for practical use . It 's difficult to fit more than three lines of text on this size label and still have it be large enough to read . The typical return address is three to four lines . The largest I can make the common font Times New Roman is 6.5 point in order to fit three lines of text on a label . Fitting four lines requires going down to only 4.5 . ( A typical font size is 10 to 12 point . ) While there 's nothing wrong with these labels , I prefer using shipping labels as return address labels . Using a larger-sized label allows users to fit four lines of text , a larger font size , or even a piece of clip-art . While this small size is functional and fuss-free , and one print yields an impressive 60 labels , legibility is sacrificed when labels are this small .	1
These labels are a godsend for labeling and mailing things . This 0.5 '' x 1.75 '' size is perfect for return addresses and small labels . I prefer the 1 '' size for most things because of the larger size , but these work for smaller items . I have used them to put my son 's name on his school supplies , binders , etc . as well as for my things in the classroom like student names on cubbies , pencil cans , supplies in the storage cabinet . Avery.com has templates that you can use and it does not take too much time to figure out how to print on them , so do n't be scared . 2000 labels per package are just waiting for you !	1
While address labels may not be the most interesting thing I buy , getting good labels that are easy to print does matter to me . And the Avery White Easy Peel Return Address Labels 8167 were exactly what I was looking for.They truly are , as advertised , easy to peel off the backing . And they do n't smudge after being printed , nor do they jam in the printer.But for me , perhaps the most important thing about labels is the ease of using the printing website . I found the Avery site easy to use.The bottom line ? Five stars . Easy to print and use and economical . Win win win .	1
I bought the inkjet labels because I wanted to custom design my labels with colors using my inkjet printer . In the past , the inkjet labels did not print as clear and tended to look `` smudgy '' or `` blurry '' . No more . Avery has fixed this problem and now the labels print crisp . I highly recommend them .	1
Avery have literally set the standard for pre-cut adhesive peel-off labels and these are no different . Easy to remove from the backing ( much easier than some other brands ) and high quality paper and strong backing glue make these labels perfect for your label needs . I printed a bunch with a photo background and they look almost as good as a glossy print . Plus Avery always offers templates for the most used software packages ( outlook , excel etc ) so printing alignment and pre-filled info is handled for you so no need to perform multiple test prints before doing a proper print.It may seem like a simple thing to print onto labels but anyone who has used generic labels which do n't conform to any standard will know just how many you can waste before everything is lined up . With Avery 's labels the hard work is done for you and your labels will look perfect first time .	1
As others have stated here , a label is a label is a label ... right ? Not always . There are many factors that I look at when buying labels , especially in quantity:1 . Price . Big variances between 'generic ' and 3M , Avery , etc.2 . Glue . Good glue wo n't come through the label.3 . Adhesive Quality . Labels should n't come off an envelope ( which could result in a dead letter ) , and they should n't come off in the printer ( which could result in the need for a new printer ) .4 . Ease of removing from sheet . If they are not easy to remove , the label can be easily torn . Sometimes I 've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value , and have the other characteristics of good labels . Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product ( even at a much lower price ) I buy the Avery .	1
I use these exclusively as a return label set for my and for my parents who are getting old . I print out a set every once in a while and I keep them on a clipboard . Once a year I print out a few sets of these and mail them to my parents , whose eyes and arthritis make it a bit hard to do these things anymore and it 's a tremendous help to them . They are too small for the full address.I 've also used them to label odd things . Overall a great product.I will say that the easy peel adhesive works grreat on paper but do n't try it on plastic . I used them to label baby bottles and these did not peel off easily from plastic . Magic on paper though .	1
Avery has some of the best products , and this is one . These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels . I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company . Now , you can do all that stuff yourself right at home . As I mentioned , this is simple for anyone to set up . The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels . They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels , labels for kitchen items , yard sale price stickers , etc ... .	1
These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills . I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail . Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans . I 've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels . Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address . Just load a full page into your printer ( I have a laser printer ) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes . These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification .	1
These are a replacement product for the 5167 labels many of us have used succesfully for years . I ca n't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so , as far I 'm concerned , the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick . They work just fine in myBrother HL2270DW laser printer , once I learned to orient the top of the sheet to the front of the paper tray in this printer . That 's a change from all the HP printers I 've used in the past and had me thinking the formatting was off in Avery 's Design Pro software . Once I figured it out , the labels and the software are just what I needed .	1
As with all Avery labels I have tried , these work very well . They print go through the printer without jamming , print cleanly , peel easily , and stick tightly.What more could you want ? Highly recommended .	1
What can I say about address labels ? These worked well in the laser printer , did n't jam and peeled off cleanly . The type on the labels printed clearly too . These will work well for return address labels . They 're too small for regular addresses . As usual Avery has a quality product .	1
I 'm a regular user of other Avery products ( address labels , return labels , etc ) and I 've never been disappointed . These labels are no exception . They come off the sheet easily , which prevents `` dog-eared '' labels . Simple concept , but brilliant . I 'll look for these again in the future .	1
Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim . They 're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case , packages or envelopes . I 'm taking away one star because they 're harder to use in the printer than they should be . It 's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly . Granted , part of that is my own fault . But these should be easier to use . However , overall it 's a fine product .	1
These are labels . They stick . You can print on them . They peel easily . Not sure what else to say . Avery always has the highest quality of labels and they 're worth paying a little extra for .	1
These are fantastic labels , just like the rest of the Avery line . I like that these are small - they have so many uses ! Will definitely purchase in the future .	1
The Avery Easy Peel Return Address Labels work great in my Brother HL-2270DW laser printer . It has yet to jam and does not smudge . The 5267 return address label is supported natively in Microsoft Word , even in my old Office XP version . If you prefer , you can download the Word template from Avery 's website . Why ? It 's easier to use this template if you want to have different addresses on the same sheet . Also , maybe you do n't have Microsoft Office but have a compatible word processing program like WordPerfect or OpenOffice.The pop-up edge is a neat idea to allow for easy peeling though I really never had problems peeling the old style labels . Labels are n't very exciting and there is only so much you can do to differentiate between one manufacturer 's labels to another 's . However , the paper , adhesive , and the easy-peel feature on the Avery 5267 are all top notch and I have no complaints . I typically buy office store-brand labels but these Avery 's seem to have a better overall quality.2000 labels are a great deal but the 8000 label pack is even better , if you send out lots of mail . Given that I only send out a few pieces of mail per month , these will probably last me several years .	1
Though these labels are meant for laser printers , I was able to use them successfully with an inkjet printer . Just goes to prove the quality and flexibility of Avery brand labels ! : )	1
I think the Avery labels are superior to all of the off-brands that are out there ( and I 've tried several of those ) . These labels do peel very easily and no Avery label ( including these ) has yet jammed any of my printers . The paper quality ( bright white and sturdy ) is also quite nice . Avery is always my first choice in printer labels !	1
These labels print well in my HP LaserJet 3200 , and they peel off easily , but they print a little too far down the page , as compared with the old model # 5267 labels , and the top line of the label prints higher and higher as the labels go down the page , so about 1/4 of the labels at the bottom of the sheet have their top line cut off . It may be that this is a printer issue , however .	1
I have used Avery address labels in the past and love their templates for large mailings . The easy peel feature improves the old labels . I highly recommend these .	1
I have grown to trust the Avery name represents `` Quality '' . Avery again fulfilled all expectations for a great product that prints without jamming ( I found one mfr who 's labels sometimes come off inside my laser printer ... ) , looks great AND meets all requirements for a great product . I love the fact I can print easily within MS Word 2010/2011 with peace of mind . Additionally , Avery 's website features templates and easy to print methods online without having to download software . Avery gets another gold star in my book ! In particular , these smudge free labels are the perfect size for return address labels , 35mm slides , labeling the backs of photographs , labeling the inside of books with the owner 's information ( such as a return address label format ) , etc . I use this size label for labeling canning jars , packets of herbs and seeds as well as labeling the clear drawers in my husband 's electronic parts bins.Tips : I often will print one sheet to standard copy paper FIRST , then verify my page lines up correctly with the label sheet PRIOR to printing and wasting an entire sheet of labels , needlessly . Another option is to print on the BACK of the labels first , align , then print on the correct side of the page .	1
These are the perfect address labels that are small enough to fit the return forms I deal with each month , so I do n't have to use my hideous handwriting to fill out the forms.I also enjoy the seasonal templates they have free at the Avery website for downloading that add holiday fun to my letters , Another reason I prefer the Avery labels is the great `` Pop-up Edge '' they have added , which makes the fast peeling of labels very quick & easy , when doing a stack of mail ,	1
After years of using an ink-jet printer , I finally bought an economical laser printer . These laser labels are perfect for the kind of labels that I keep handy - a few dozen printed labels for each family member , and my own return labels.I had no problem running these through my Brother laser printer , using Word 2011 for Mac , template 5267 . Avery is always worth the extra money ! Their quality is outstanding , and this product is no different . The labels do n't jam , they line up properly , and they peel easily . In other words , they work well , and they do n't annoy me when I go to use them , and that is something I look for in a product I pay a premium for . Avery is my go-to for printer products -- worth the few extra cents ( or even a dollar ) because I know it will get the job done over the months the packet will be in my desk drawer .	1
I just recently got my first laser printerBrother Printer HL2270DW Wireless Monochrome Printer ( with which I am very happy , I find it works exponentially faster and more efficiently than ANY ink printer I have owned ) and then these labels came up , which I thought was the perfect test for my new printer ! Essentially , they print up great , and of course it will vary from printer to printer , but I did n't have any issues with these , smearing or getting caught or anything of the like . If you are looking for return address labels for a laser printer , then these work extremely well , and are priced at the same as just about any other pack of address labels ; they are worth it . : ) God Bless ~Amy	1
I 've used this exact Avery label for years as our return address label . I got this particular pack free through the Amazon Vine program in exchange for writing a review of the product.These labels are the perfect size for return addresses , and they are super easy to print using an Avery template or one that comes with your MSWord program . The adhesive is strong so they stay securely stuck to your envelopes . The `` easy peel '' part of the name means they peel easily off the backing sheet when you bend it . With 2000 labels in each pack , you 'll be all set to send out those bills , letters and Christmas cards .	1
It is so easy to use these laser printer labels . There 's a pre-loaded template in Word ( you just have to select the item # ) , and they print clean and clear , and peel and stick easily . Just what we need in our busy lives -- simplicity !	1
These are everything you could want in printable address labels . Easy to use , set up , and print . And it 's a good price for a good number of labels.We go through a pack roughly every month or two in our office ( small insurance agency ) . Avery makes some of the best office products , and these are no exception !	1
These labels are great . They line up perfectly in Microsoft Word , and they print right every single time . Use them constantly .	1
I have been using these labels for organizing and mailing my graduate school application materials . They work perfectly in conjunction with Microsoft Word and my small HP P1000 Laser Jet printer . As other reviewers have noted , they are easy to peel and apply firmly to most surfaces . Highly recommended for their ease of use and professional , clean look . A+	1
Another great product by Avery . These labels are extremely easy to use and they do n't smear in my laser printer . And by using the template software that Avery has ( DesignPro ) it is extremely easy to make your own designs . I will buy again .	1
These are excellent . Like most Avery labels , no smudging , easy to work with . Worked great with my laser printer . I recommend all Avery products ... at least the many that I have used so far !	1
Return address labels save you time , and the Avery system is easier-to-use than many.These labels perform exactly as described . They feed perfectly , are perfectly spaced on the label sheet , are easy to peel and position , and they can be repositioned many times yet still stick firmly.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work : You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5267Type in what you want on the labeland Print.The label sheet even shows you which end to insert in your printer.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking return address labels .	1
I received both Avery # 8167 and # 5267 to review . Since they are identical ( same specs and template number ) but one is designed for an inkjet printer ( 8167 ) and one is for a laser printer ( 5267 ) , I 'll be posting the same review for both items.These Labels are designed with a `` Pop Up '' Edge . This means that you bend the sheet at the side and the labels you want literally pop up an exposed edge so you can grab them easily . Then you fold the sheet flat again . As with most labels , you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels . In my experience , each subsequent use of a partial sheet runs a greater risk of a jam though . I 'm sure Avery 's `` jam free guarantee '' would only apply to a print of a full page.These smaller size labels would also be useful for other applications-such as price tags at a garage sale ... I 've never found Avery to be anything but top of the line and this product is no exception .	1
Excellent labels . They adhered themselves to my envelopes like little soldiers ... just as if their tiny little label lives depended on it ... which , I suppose , they did . There is room to write even the most pretentious European address , where they add all kinds of extra lines just to show off that they are in Europe , when we in America , the largest God Given Land Mass in The Continental World Of Its Kind , need just 3 lines.Does it mean we are better than those who live overseas ? Maybe . And we do n't have to talk with those fancy accents either , or in those foreign languages . What 's with them ? When did they start with that ? Do they think they are too good to speak English ? Which is the language used in the Bible , so are they sending a message that way , too ? Like to Satan or his mignons ? ? ? ? BAnyway that is for each of us to determine in his or her own heart , and we are not here to talk about the snide , red-tinged and possibly devil worshiping Europeans , but about these Avery Labels , so let us return to our subject . But you must admit , speaking a foreign language AND using more than 3 lines in an adress is just putting it on that one layer too thick . .Okay , here we are , back to the labels again . What makes Avery 1/2 X 1 3/4 Laser Printer Labels one notch better than your label ( and certainly your inferior European label ) , what takes them to that semi-mythical Uber-label pantheon , is the stick up edge . You know when you have ten million labels to stick on envelopes and you try bending the page so the labels are easier to pull off , but some bend and some do n't , and a couple even bend too far so they get stuck to themselves and you have to sneaky throw them away so no one will see ? Well finally somebody twigged to the need for a bent edge label and here it is.The bent edge does not make sticking labels on envelopes any less miserable , time-consuming and tedious a job , one more suited to , say , the Europeans . Labelling is awful work , particularly when one does it in one 's office where one can not turn the TV set on to watch Judge Judy , but the Avery Labels have that bent edge , a new High Tech Cutting Edge Design Element that makes the job go a little bit faster and every little bit helps . And if you want to know why , at my age , my job still entails sticking labels on envelopes , it 's because Shut Up .	1
The labels are fine - they peel and stick with ease . However , I wasted a few sheets because the print would not line up properly . The instructions say to use Avery template 5267 but this does not work . After some experimenting and waste of product , I found that 5167 works the best .	1
Another good one from Avery . I 'm never disappointed with Avery labels or other products , though I confess that Staples brand ( when it 's available ) can be significantly cheaper with no apparent loss of quality .	1
These are good , standard solid LASER labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package ( so helpful ) and I 've used the 3M version , Avery version , and branded store versions ( like Office Depot ) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose , I 'd make your decision based on price , and features such as the Easy Peel ( which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings , wedding/shower invitations , etc ) ... as well as other features like ( is it for a LASER or INKJET ) printer ? [ this is for LASER printers ] Is it the right adhesive ( does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using ) ... I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands , but Avery has been making good labels for a long time , so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process ! Great labels , good size ( I like these smaller address labels for return address labels ) - would recommend !	1
This item works great . Edge sticks up for easy peel . Sticks very permanent , make sure you have it where you want it before you stick , as there will be know removing and re-sticking . Prints through your laser printer good .	1
My family and I recently moved into a new home and I needed some easy/inexpensive return address labels . These Avery labels were easy to use in my home printer using the template they recommended . Super duper easy to peel off and use . I do n't think I 'll have to buy return address labels for a looooong time since the pack comes with 2,000 of them !	1
There 's really not a lot to say about these labels . They do exactly what I want them to do . I got them to use for return address labels , and for that they are perfect . They are just the right size , and they print well . You could also use them for the main address label if your recipient 's address is short enough.Recommended .	1
I tried the new Avery laser printer labels with the `` Pop-up Edge '' and found them easy to use . The die-cut labels fed well through my HP laser printer , stuck well on envelopes and packages , and did n't smear . These labels may also be written on by hand when called for which is a useful benefit . The `` Pop-up Edge '' is a feature which allows you to fold the sheet so one edge lifts , making it easy to peel the label from the sheet . The center `` margin '' has also been removed to facilitate easier removal compared to earlier products . I found this `` Pop-up '' to be a double edged sword so to speak as once the labels are `` popped-up , '' I found that they do n't quite go back to flat . The feature is good if you are printing a whole sheet but I sometimes print individual labels which means the popped label is a potential jam in the printer.I found that the Avery labels get the job done which earns them 4 stars . Compared to the 3M labels however , the Avery labels are more expensive and I do not think the `` Pop-up Edge '' is as effective as 3M 's `` Quick Lift Design . ''	1
I am always amazed how these things survive my laser printer without peeling off . After that they 're pretty much just labels , they hold ink and stick to things . So if you like the price and need labels , order them : )	1
Comfortable to use with the keyboard . It is ergonomically good to have one . Supports your wrist .	1
We love it , no more wrist pain .	1
Cheap and it does the job.I have two of these , end to end , across the front of my desk.I 've used them for about a month and notice a positive difference in how my hands and wrists feel at the end of a work day.The bottom is reasonably grippy and stays in place , while not & # 34 ; adhering & # 34 ; itself to the desk top .	1
Bought for work where the computer setup was not comfortable . These reduced my wrist pain .	1
I 'd recommend this item . I just got it to replace one I had for about 7 years . This is very nice and durable . I was very impressed and the price ca n't be beat .	1
No major complaints ! It does it 's job at work and has helped me reduce any joint pain when I type at work ! I loved the color and the price . It came very quickly . Would recommend to a friend .	1
Belkin Wrist Pad is a great support for all people who spend lot of time working with their keyboards that will help your wrists and hands do n't get tired so much.It 's lightweight , very comfortable , ergonomic product and it 's made asymmetrical that is great for me because position of hands during keyboard use is n't the same.The pad is filled with gel making it adjustable to your own hands thus providing great support.I like keyboard wrist pads that are n't combined with mouse pads because that allows user to combine position of keyboards and mouse in a way that is convenient to the user , but also making it suitable for both left-handers and right-handers.Since I use it for a month I can not yet speak about its durability though it 's looking like a lasting product that does n't wear a lot during use.Overall , this Belkin Wrist Pad would be my first recommendation if you are searching for good wrists support being in front of the computer for a whole day .	1
I purchased 3 of these for coworkers who wanted better ergonomics . The wave wrist rest functions well and available here on Amazon for a good price . It is contoured which makes it more comfortable and the width is perfect for tight placement .	1
My wife was having soreness in her wrists that may have signaled the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome . I ordered the Belkin Wave Rest wrist pad , and since she started using it , the soreness has subsided . She loves the pad . It 's about an inch wider than the keyboard she 's using , so she does n't have to move her hands off the pad . I 've used it a few times , and I liked it enough that I may get one for myself.I think the wrist pad is worth trying for anyone who may be developing carpal tunnel syndrome or any related problem .	1
works well . user ( s ) , however , should position their hands , chair height , lumbar support , take frequent breaks etc , for optimal ergonomics & minimizing repetitive injuries .	1
I purchased this product so I can use it at work . It is very comfortable and the price is affordable .	1
This is an excellent product ! No issues with this and is consistent with the described purpose . Fills the needs for the intended purpose .	1
Bright , easy to use , and worked as intended without a flaw . Avery has always made quality office products ( I used to sell them years ago ) and these labels are no diferent . Print away !	1
These labels are perfect for many uses . I use them for shipping labels and for labeling items that I am storing . Also , I am using them as gift labels for packages for the poor for Christmas . With the easy to use template , you can decorate these labels to make pretty tags that stick and do n't come off . Avery labels are great !	1
Love these I 've been busy shipping many things so these are so wonderful to use . I 've also used them in my address book -- updated everyone 's info and it looks so nice typed and on these great labels .	1
I love Avery labels ! Their free templates are easy to find and download . The labels print flawlessly every time . And they are durable . I really ca n't say enough about these terrific time savers . I design my own return address labels with a family portrait on them , I print out address labels for my holiday cards , and I print larger labels for packages , all with ease ! If you are looking for high quality labels that wo n't let you down , Avery is the way to go ...	1
These labels are what I have needed for years . We are always returning items and also often sell items on ebay . I have actually put together 2 small labels all these years . Finally , I can now print the labels from my computer and easily attach to the packages . Thanks , Amazon .	1
I have been using the Avery Shipping Lables for years for my buisness . They work out beautifully ! Easy to format on word and other programs . I use these as shipping lables but they are great for other things too ! I have used them to put labels on a small bag of popcorn . I have used them to place on the kids gift bags for birthday parties ! So many uses for them !	1
love the size so you can write or type big for the adddress and looks so professional rather than just writing on the envelope . Sometimes I write them out by hand and other times I print them out on my laser jet printer so I can do different colors . Turns out great every time and no getting stuck or labels coming loose while printing . Feeds easily through the printer .	1
These 2 x 4 labels are a nice size not only for covering previous labels on packages but also for adding a larger font when printing out labels and there is enough room to add an image/design . I would order this larger size label again . They were packaged well and arrived within the two day delivery time .	1
These labels worked great . I needed 190 and bought these and they work great . They print easy , the template in MS Word ( I have MS Office 2000 ) worked like a champ . No complaints at all .	1
I give these labels my highest recommendation as I like to recycle packaging ( envelopes , boxes , plastic mailers ) and they are sufficiently thick so that you only need one to cover up any addresses , codes , instructions that would ordinarily make it hard to reuse packaging . Even if you tend not to be a person who recycles , these will serve you well in case you need to return a purchase using the same package that it came in.Easy to peel and can be used for addressing using computer software or just as good to peel off and write over them by hand . Priced reasonably and there is little else to say about `` labels . '' If you need them , these are as good as it gets for the reasons highlighted above.If you use labels exclusively for mailings on new envelopes , you might be able to save a few dollars and buy another Avery product that has more labels for a similar price .	1
My HP 460 inkjet printer can print on these without any problems . The pages feed into the printer smoothly and the ink does n't smudge after printing . Avery also provides plenty of software templates on their website for you to use . Just go to [ ... ] and search for 5163 ( this information is on the label packaging too ) . They provide many premade label designs in Word Doc format and blank templates for other applications like InDesign and Photoshop . Also , the TrueBlock feature really does block out everything behind the label , which is great when you 're reusing old boxes for shipping . Overall , I 'm very happy with these labels .	1
I have reviewed several label products in the past , and have always found Avery to create a quality product , which does everything it says it will do , and will make you look fabulous and resourceful in the office , which ca n't hurt at employee review time . : - ) These labels are no exception . They have permanent sticking power and are a strong enough white that nothing will show through the label . This is important now that so many companies are trying to be green by recycling old shipping cartons . If your company does n't do this yet , suggest that they do so . It will save them money ( green ! ) when they do n't buy new shipping cartons and reduces the cost of waste removal ( more green ! ) . AND , it keeps cartons out of landfills , which is the greenest part of the whole deal.Back to the labels . A while back , I reviewed some labels that had Microsoft Word templates you could load onto a computer and design the labels of your dreams . I commented that most companies have rules against anyone but the IT department loading software onto their computers , which made the software less than practical for the people who use these at work . Avery has now solved this problem : they still offer the Microsoft word uploads , but you can also go to their web site and design the labels of your dreams without putting anything on your work machine . I tried the Microsoft Word add-on software and was impressed by the results.My project was to pack up some old summer clothes in old copy paper boxes , labeling each box top and bottom so that they could be retrieved easily . Copy paper boxes are printed with many dark colors and graphics , and if the label was going to have a show through problem , this was the time for it . The no show through technology worked like a charm - nothing shows through onto the face of the label , and it 's a cinch to find my `` outgrown bathing suits - wo n't fit again in this lifetime . `` Why four stars instead of five ? Because they 're labels , not a cure for cancer . I like the labels , but it 's not like we 're going out or anything . : - )	1
I used these as name tags in my classroom on folders . I also used them on boxes that I packed away for future use . I mailed a present to my sister in another state with some of them . They have worked great for all three purposes . They stick well and do n't peel up around the edges . The markers ( sharpie type ) do n't bleed on them . They are very effective for many purposes besides just shipping . And they do a great job for their main purpose as well .	1
I send lots of gifts to my out-of-state grandchildren , and I love to reuse boxes I already have -- think of all the stuff Amazon sends you ( what a perfect way to save a tree by recycling boxes ) ! One of the drawbacks of reusing boxes is that you will have to scribble out all the previous markings from the box . Not so with these labels with TrueBlock Technology ! They have a gray coating on the back of each label , which efficiently hides even the darkest marks , even on white boxes.The only drawback is that the gray coating makes these labels `` less sticky , '' making me wonder if they might peel off the package in transit . To prevent this , I put clear tape on all sides of the label ( just to be safe ) , and it 's a small inconvenience , because I do n't have to spend tons of time scribbling out all the markings when I send gifts to my grandchildren any more.One more benefit ... These do n't `` hang up '' in my HP Photosmart inkjet printer , and ( as long as I do n't run a wet finger through the fresh ink ) the ink does n't smear .	1
I used these for two reasons - to print addresses for shipping padded envelopes and to help label and organize my bathroom closet.They were perfect for both.The address labels were printed on an inkjet printer which I thought would smear but they came out fine . I used the standard paper setting and did n't have to fiddle with the gloss or stock weight settings at all . The colors looked nice on there , too . They were affixed to those brown padded envelopes and they stuck on really well . They are sticky and re-positionable but ONLY if you pull it off very quickly . Great size - fit full addresses with room to spare.Then , I used a Sharpie to write names on the stickers to match up with the little organization bins I have in my bathroom closet and that worked great , too . The sharpie marker looks fantastic on the matte surface.I will use these again !	1
What can I say ? Avery makes great labels . These are my favorite size , and I love that they block out what 's underneath so I can reuse shipping envelopes .	1
I bought for the purpose of placing a printed label in a small address book . This works perfect and by using printed labels you names and address etc ... are easy to read and legible , also if someone moves , just place a new label over top , possibly you might be able to remove the old one . I have not tried that yet though .	1
When a template works , it 's great . This time ... it all worked out . Adhesive , easy to use . Worked well for labels on envelopes	1
These 2 X 4 inch white shipping labels are just the right size for most mailings . 250 labels in the compact sleeve holder . The smaller sized ones do n't give you enough room to print out the address comfortably . They pull off the backing , and are self-stick adhesive , and they stay stuck onto the front of the envelope without any problem.Do n't waste your money on the smaller sized ones , get these instead.Highly recommended .	1
The Avery labels have been around for a long time now and work as well as ever . I was pleased with the value of this package . It was becoming hard to find the plain 2X4 labels and there 's enough in the pack to last me a long time .	1
I 've never had a complaint about Avery labels . By the way , here is another use I found for them . My wife is filling in as teacher for a class of 4-year olds . There are more kids than swings at recess , and this was causing fights and discontent . Now the kids get `` swing tickets '' printed on Avery labels ( kids LOVE stickers ) and based on their good behavior . So far , she says it 's worked wonders .	1
I received this through the Amazon vine program . These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label . The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it . I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling .	1
I bought these labels for two reasons ; one , to use as shipping labels ; second , for labelling my DVD storage cases . The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title , and they stick very well ; the application is easy and fast . The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance . The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases . It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer . They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced . I have rated these labels four stars for the design , quality and overall satisfaction .	1
These are good , standard solid INK JET labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package ( so helpful ) and I 've used both the 3M version , Avery version , and branded store versions ( like Office Depot ) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose , I 'd make your decision based on price , and features such as the TrueBlock Technology included on these ( which makes using a a recycled box or envelope much easier - it 's thicker and truly covers up the older used labels below ! ) ... as well as other features like ( is it for a LASER or INKJET - this is for INK JET printers - believe me , it does make a difference ! It affects the ink , smudging , smoothness , finish , etc . ) printer ? Is it the right adhesive ( does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using ) ... I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands , but Avery has been making good labels for a long time , so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process and the way I can re-use old boxes for mailing with these ! I am a bigger fan of Laser printers than Ink Jet , but I have one of each , and these work great in the Ink Jet printer !	1
These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised . The dark gray backing does an excellent job of covering up whatever is underneath the label . The size is perfect for packages , and they do n't smudge easily . I just wish the adhesive was a little bit stronger . These labels can be peeled off without much effort , which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box , but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and ca n't be removed . An easy solution ( though perhaps not very elegant ) is to cover the label with clear packing tape.Overall I like these labels , and I think the price is reasonable . Perhaps in the future Avery will come out with an extra-strong/permanent version of these , which I would gladly give five stars .	1
These Avery shipping labels are easy to use . The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for both the to : address and a return address . They stick very well . The labels make it easy to reuse boxes and large envelopes because they have a gray blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I 've had no trouble using my ink-jet printer to print the labels and the Avery templates make it snap to produce professional looking results .	1
There are a lot of options when it comes to labels and it can be hard to pick one that is best . Although placing a normal label on a surface with writing covers most of it up , these ensure that it does . I tested several and they do work well . These labels are great for packages and are the type I use most often.As for the stickiness of these labels , I would say they are about average . They are probably not going to fall off in transit , but can peel off mostly clean or completely clean on the surface they were attached to . Overall , these are good labels , but there is n't a whole lot of difference between them and others .	1
Excellent cover up 's for your mis-printed envelopes . The perfect size to cover up most addresses . Sticks well , prints excellent . Removes from the sheet easily .	1
These are general use return address/locate labels . 2 inch by 4 inches . I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers , so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website . And , of course , Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning , so you can not loose buying these . And the TrueBlock really works . I took one of the blank labels and pasted it on the dark blue folder the lables come in . No blue shows through , it is pure white..	1
It 's environmentally friendly to reuse packaging material , but it can be annoying when you try to cover up or tear up old labels . The Avery TrueBlock Technology comes to the rescue . It 's a time saver and frustration free solution .	1
These labels are excellent . They feed well and do n't smudge . Standard size and very useful . What more could you want ?	1
I 'm a label lover . My cranky old inkjet has started chewing up the occasional label sheet , but for whatever reason , these go through without a hitch . I use them for more than shipping , no home office can be without these .	1
Avery is a brand I trust I have tried other but not sure of names they did not stand up to the quality of Avery Labels . They fit my files great and last for years . I would recommend to friends . I have been in my own business for 5 year , But used them in other companies prior .	1
I always used avery for mailing and shipping labels , and these are the larger sized ones for boxes , etc . Like them .	1
The easy-peel feature makes it easier to get the labels off the sheet . You bend the page in half and then back again . The product is fool-proof . The tricky parts are doing the mail merge into the word processor.The templates come with Microsoft Word and WordPerfect . At the website they have templates for image processing software , too.If you have a specific question , make a comment and I will figure out the answer .	1
I 've been using Avery labels for my label needs for many years . The best thing about Avery labels that they stick on very well , smoothly , without puckers . I use the lables also with the colored ink jet printer and black and white laser printer . The paper quality is good and there is no blurring of ink when used with ink jet printers . Laser printer results are excellent as well.I usually do need to print a huge number of labels and ca n't fill the entire sheet . However I found that I can reliably print the labels on the sheet in two several passes , even when some labels were alredy peeled off . o avoid labels sicking to the printer I flip the sheet and have the part that has no peeled labels go first . This really helps me to save money and only print what I need without waste.Avery redesigned the label sheet to reduce wasted paper . Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels . Despite less of a hold on the labels I am still able to feed the paper through twice as described above.There is a large variety of free templates for use with Avery labels , all you need to know is the number of the label to get the right template . Using templates I get perfect results with several different word processors - no waste , all labels get printered and perfectly aligned.You ca n't go wrong with Avery labels.Ali Julia review	1
Rarely does a company claim something is improved that actually is better , but this is one of those rare occasions . The simple lack of paper in between the columns of labels does wonders for the ease of peeling off a label . Why this is n't a common practice for all printable stickers is the real question . No more bending the paper to peel one off . On my inkjet printer the printed labels look wonderful as far as colors and clarity . With the template I was able to customize several mailing labels for different seasons and different addresses . The labels affix to envelopes easily and I have n't noticed any peeling . I have only used the labels on regular envelopes , so I do n't know how they would hold up on any other type of packaging ( such as padded envelopes ) , but will update if I ever find out . The labels could have been a little longer to allow for a longer address in larger fonts or a small picture/clip art , but I still was able to put a small jack-o-lantern in front of my friend 's address when sending her a Halloween card ( only really sent her one so I could use more labels just for fun ) . I just had to use a smaller font next to the clip art , but it still is a good size.Word of caution : Depending on your printer , the printing may be off center or higher on the label than expected . I 'm almost positive this is my printer because I have had this issue with mailing seals as well , but just wanted to advise others to check this before printing many labels .	1
I like using Avery labels because the templates never fail . These address labels are easy to peel off and work well for mail merges .	1
I figured these labels would be comparable with other Avery labels . these are truly smudge free and easy to peel off ... .no rips or tears from the sheet .	1
Have n't felt well so I have n't used it yet a lot of times you send the reviews too sone for me to have used the product	1
Made stickers for out gift boxes for our wedding . We printed them ourselves and they turned out great . Recommend this product .	1
I have been using Avery labels for many years and feel you ca n't beat their quality . They stick very well but peel off easily when necessary . I have tried other brands that have been on thinner paper but have found the Avery to be the best , although the price is comparable . For anyone who needs peel off address labels this is the one for you .	1
Avery labels are an outstanding product and these labels have a Pop-up Edge to make peeling easy . I often tug at a label , insert my fingernail or knife under one attempting to release it , sometimes tearing the label . These labels eliminate these hassles . A bonus is that if your word processor software does n't have a template for them , you can download it on Avery 's website . I like the size of these labels , too .	1
I have used different labels over the years and it is difficult to compete with the reliability of Avery labels . They are the & # 34 ; cheapest & # 34 ; brand around but they are consistent each and every time . I will keep on buying them .	1
I have used Avery Labels for years and all I can say is they are still the only game in town when it comes to ease of use , quality and getting the job done on a standard ink jet printer . I ca n't remember an Avery Label coming off.Something I really like is there whiteness and the contrast with ink jet black . As stated they are truly easy to peel .	1
Do n't you hate it when you have to pick and pick at the corner of a label ... . Avery 's Easy Peel Address Labels are very easy to peel ... They are a bit thinner than the Avery Repositionable labels , but still very strong . Very easy to print on and the ink - no matter the color shows up great ... Be sure the check out avery 's website for templates and more ...	1
Like most pieces of paper in a printer when you want it line up with something it is hard . These labels worked perfectly and stuck on envelopes without issues . They stick very well and if you need to remove one either do n't put it on fully or just put another one over it since it is n't coming off .	1
I 'll keep this review brief : These labels are very nice . Convenient to use with my inkjet printer , and getting the template for printing them is a snap . You just go to avery.com/templates , then select 'templates ' from the left , then go to the 'address labels ' menu , then pick the 'clear - 30 per sheet ' template that works with your word processing program ( I use Word ) . From Word , it was as simple as selecting Open -- > navigating to the template on My Documents , then filling it out and printing normally.The only thing for me is that I do n't typically send to the same address a lot of times , so I wo n't be going through these too quickly . I do my bills and stuff online now , so ... the days of needing address labels are coming to an end ( for me ) .Still , you get a bunch of easy-to-print labels for about a cent each . Saves you time messing with a pen and could be very useful for when you 're sending out invitations for which you have the addresses of the invitees on your computer and do n't want to bother writing out a bunch of labels .	1
These are just that I needed . I love the convenience of just pushing a button at work and having supplies like these delivered before I would have had time to go get them .	1
I know it 's hard to get excited about mailing labels , particularly if you do not do any broadcast mailings . But , these labels are easy to use with MS Word templates . But unless you are going to have a printer that serves only as a label printer , if you have only one or two labels to print , you will save time by writing them by hand because there is some setup time . As long as you have names and addresses stored in Word , and do not have to take time to add new addresses for a particular mailing , I think three labels is the point where you start saving time by printing them on your printer.There is really nothing special about the labels , the adhesive is good and evenand the paper is bright white . I could have given these labels a 5 star rating but Amazon 's description of 5 stars is `` I Love It '' . While I can think of no way to improve upon this product , I can not save `` I love it '' with any sincerity , hence , the rating of 4 Stars .	1
I 've used Avery labels for years and been very satisfied . The new easy-peel feature makes these the best yet !	1
You ca n't go wrong with Avery . They are the masters of the office products genre . And these labels are no exception . They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing , and do n't want to print out envelope by envelope , here is the solution . If you so choose , they , of course , can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1 '' x 2-5/8 '' and very appropriate for No . 10 or smaller envelopes . Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise . They peel off easily and adhere easily . They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail . These do n't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose .	1
Avery makes the best in my estimation and these work perfectly with my software and printer . I use a smaller version for return address labels . This is probably my tenth pack of them .	1
This worked smoothly and seamlessly in my laser printer as well even though they are intended for inkjet . I find that Avery and 3M ( same company ) always make the best labels .	1
They seem to work fine so far . For those having problems : I would suggest you only use them on paper-based envelopes or material . OR , if used on a sticky surface perhaps cover the label with shipping tape . Just my suggestion .	1
I use these labels to do marketing campaigns for my small landscaping business , and I was so impressed with how crisp and clean they look.The only stickers on the sheet are the labels themselves , so they are super easy to peel off , and you are n't left with any stupid little bits sticking to your fingers once you 're nearly done using the sheet of labels . I really love that new design.The labels also went through my printer with no issue . I was worried that because they 've eliminated that outer quarter inch of excess label and just left the labels themselves on the sheet , that the sheets might get stuck in my printer or not feed as well . To test how they fed , I loaded in a stack of labels instead of feeding them one at a time as I used to . I need n't have worried , my printer took up each sheet with no difficulty and no jamming and printed out beautiful address labels.I 'm very happy with the quality here . They 've really managed to eliminate everything I find annoying about printer labels . Everything about these is perfect .	1
I 've always been pleased with Avery products in the past and these labels are no exception . The quality is good and the easy-peel feature is very convenient .	1
These are great labels : cost effective , opaque , and they peel off their backing when you are ready to stick them on something rather than inside your printer.The free Avery templates ( available online ) make formatting a breeze.Highly recommended .	1
These work great in my printer , and peel easily from the backing . We use them to put important information on business cards for reminders .	1
Avery brand labels are the best ... .. these are just like in the store , only cheaper . It is a good product that I use a lot ... ... have never had any problems with the labels I 've bought from Amazon .	1
Just got a new printer - the old one had trouble pulling through labels etc to keep on the lines . This one does not , and so the labels themselves are great No complaints !	1
Do you ever get tired of writing out all the information onto an envelope ? Me too , so I decided to get with the 20th century ( I know its now the 21st century ) and print out labels . It was so easy , that I started labeling everything from which tools should be in what drawer of the toolbox to what items are missing from the shelves at work for re-order . This is great . Wish I had done this sooner . As for the brand of labels themselves , they seem to be very high quality but time will tell .	1
I 've been using Avery labels , including this style , for many years.Avery caught on to the potential of what was then known as the `` micro computer '' market at the very beginning and has turned out an amazing variety of labels for a bewildering array of purposes.Labels are actually reasonably complex products in terms of the technologies they employ , such as the adhesives they employ.Well , how do you take something as seemingly simple as a 1 x 2-5/8 inch label and make it better ? Why not just leave well enough alone and continue with the same style as they started off with so many years ago ? Avery does n't think that way , which is good for us.Avery redesigned the carrier sheet so peeling off the labels is simple as can be . It used to be that you had to bend the sheet to separate a label from the sheet and then slip a fingernail underneath it to peel it off . Now , Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels and you just bend he carrier a bit and pull off the label . Simple , faster and less frustrating then it used to be.The labels are designed for ink jet printers and I had no trouble feeding them as single sheets.There was no spreading or blurring of colored inks.Avery has long offered design templates to make creating labels a lot easier . Way back when , printers and software were less sophisticated and you really had to know what you were doing to print labels without a lot of waste and hassle . Now just download the template , use it in a major word processing or other application that supports them and you 're set to go.Avery still plays at the top of the label game and this particular style carries on that well deserved honor.Jerry	1
It serves its purpose . Has tons of labels in the pack . The Easy Peel series is unbeatable , in my opinion .	1
These are quality labels . Easy to print and mine did not smudge - when used with both a laser printer and also a deskjet printer . They are the right size to use on either a legal or short envelope 1x 2 1/2 inches.Look on the Avery site for templates if your word processing application does not have this label size templated.the labels COULD be a little larger to be more readable on an envelope ... .hence the four stars . However , these do the job and you get more per package .	1
I love these labels and find that they have a million uses around the house beyond just addressing envelopes and packages . I keep a database of people to whom we send Christmas cards . It is kept in an address label template . Each year , I check the list to add or remove individuals and then run off a set of labels . Doing this instead of hand addressing dozens and dozens of envelopes saves a ton of time during the busy holiday season . If I have white envelopes for the cards I can use these labels . If the envelopes are another color , I use the clear labels . Changing the font easily adds a more artistic and attractive touch . I use the same process for party invitations for our annual Super Bowl party and for other events.The labels can be used one or two at a time to address small batches of mail . The template called for on the package is super easy to set up in the computer with no figuring out margins , spacing , offset and separation . The Easy Peel labels are fast off the page and onto the envelope with no picking and messing with removal.These labels can also be used as name tags for get togethers where all the guests do not know each other.And the labels can be used to mark items in storage . They mark shoe boxes to identify the contents , doll collection storage , jewelry storage and lots of arts and crafts containers.A wonderful way to keep all your life easily organized and to do it quickly and easily .	1
For the most part I 've always liked Avery products . These particular labels feed well through the printer . Inkjet printing comes out clean and smudge free . They also stick very well . They are the perfect size for most envelopes . I recommend them .	1
First , about the labels themselves : they work very well with ink jet printers , as designed , and fed through reliably with my Canon inkjet . The ink never smudged , and the labels came out perfectly clear . They are easy to peal off , and yet never peeled off when they were n't supposed to , even when I sent sheets through the printer with many of the labels already taken out . So , these are great labels , and I ca n't come up with a single complaint.Second , about the software : I have a Mac , so I did n't try the desktop software . However , on their website they have literally thousands of templates that will work with Microsoft office , and even Apple Pages . Much of it is a bit cheezy , but they have some very plain templates , and you can always edit out the pictures . This makes the labels extremely easy to use , as the templates avoid trial-and-error on placement and margins.All in all , a very nice label solution . One word of caution , however , and this is no fault of Avery and will happen with ANY inkjet product : the ink in inkjets is water soluble . That means if you use these for mail , you really should put transparent packing tape over the label . Probably not worth bothering to do this if you 're making return labels , but mail does occasional get wet ( neither rain nor sleet nor snow ... ) and a single drop of water can bleed an address printed on an inkjet .	1
Avery continues to be the premier label maker , as evidenced by these fine labels . There are cheaper labels than these Avery labels , but if you need extremely high quality , then these are great.And , I 've had experience with cheap labels where they get stuck half-way in the printer , and then ruin the printer . So it 's my experience that a little extra on the price for good labels can save the price of a whole new printer.I liked everything about these 30-per sheet , 1x2-5/8 inch labels.Pros : +These labels are identical top and bottom , so you can feed them either way+These labels wo n't stick/jam in the printer , even if you have some of them peeled off . I re-fed partial sheets , and they worked well.+Very white labels+Worked well with my inkjet printer+Do n't smudge very much if you get them wet+They have the unused area of the labels already torn off , so you can get to the labels easier . I think that 's what makes them `` Easy Peel '' Cons : -None that I could see , but I 'll update it if I find any	1
I gave these five stars , because they 're about as good as labels could be . Of course , at the end of the day , they 're still labels . They are nice , crisp , and sticky , and worked well with my inkjet printer . ( I have aCanon MP530 ) . Avery 's new improvement is their `` Easy Peel '' technology - there 's no label paper in between the columns , so you can bend the paper underneath to get a grip on your finished labels . I have never noticed problems lifting traditional labels , but if it 's a pet peeve of yours , then `` Easy Peel '' is something to look forward to.Where Avery really impressed me was their software . If you go to their website , they have four free options to generate labels , including mail merges , included graphics , font formatting , etc . :1 ) The old standard , Microsoft Word mail merges with templates . This is pretty much the same as I remembered - the 5160 template works perfectly , and I was able to do a test merge using my holiday list.2 ) An all online solution , `` Avery Design and Print Online . '' This is the standout for me . Cool , fully online , capable of using my data files , with clip art and good features . I like this a lot . ( It was a little finicky with my address file , but with a little editing , I got things running nicely ) .3 ) The `` Avery Wizard '' is a downloadable wizard that runs inside office products . It basically does a mail merge , but simplifies things.4 ) `` Avery Design Pro '' - I had trouble figuring out this program . It looks good for cards or envelopes , but for labels this small , it seems like more power than I needed .	1
Avery consistently pumps out quality products and the base things you can expect from their labels hold true here : no smudging , ease of setup , good adhesive . The added feature ( although not very new , but new to me ) is the Easy Peel feature . As the product copy says , `` Columns can be separated to expose label edges for easier , faster peeling '' . That about sums it up . No more folding back and prying . If you save a second per label peeling , that 's a few minutes saved on a good sized Christmas card mailing ! Anything that makes things easier in a `` commodity '' product warrants a five-star rating in my book .	1
The labels are easy to create using an ink-jet printer and easy to apply . Highly recommended .	1
I 've experimented with a number of different brands of labels but I always come back to Avery as the best . I love Avery labels because:1 ) they provide a ton of free label templates on their website that are useful for a variety of purposes2 ) they peel easily and stick great to paper envelopes3 ) they are incredibly easy to print with high accuracy . The templates ensure that you get exactly what you expect every time you print.I 'm very happy with these address labels .	1
This product works as advertised . Avery has been in the label business a long time , and knows how to specialize . They make affordable labels . The most difficult part for me in using labels made for a printer is setting up the program that has the addresses on them . Word makes this a little easier . Once this is accomplished , the labels can be put in the printer , printer settings changed to accept them , and you have printed address labels . Much quicker than doing this by hand , and they look so much better !	1
Very easy to use these labels with Microsoft Word . I had no problem and they printed out great the very first try .	1
what can I say other than it is labels and they work as they should . great price and performance . buy now	1
I 've run my own business for years and tried my fair share of printer labels . I 've tried many styles and brands and Avery brand labels continue to be my favorites . Avery seems to have done everything right with their new Easy Peel labels . The paper is just the right thickness - blocks out any print underneath without creating a raised edge that gets caught easily . The glue does n't lose adhesion over time . The paper is bright white with a smooth finish and the edges are cut smooth and clean . Perfect ! Plus the new Easy Peel feature makes peeling off a label nearly effortless . The page is creased under the edge of the label sticker . Just bend the page and the edge of the label pops up for easy grabbing . Ingenious design ! Number two runner up is 3M brand . Their paper has a slightly rougher face , but their glue is just as strong . No Easy Peel technology with 3M labels however.I 've learned to stay away from Staples brand labels and the other generic brands . The glue is worthless and the paper is too thin to cover over any old print.So if you 're looking for a great printer label and do n't mind spending a little more for quality , Avery brand Easy Peel labels are the way to go . I 've tried 5 different Avery Easy Peel styles and all are top notch .	1
If you 're doing a lot of labeling , this product makes it a lot easier to get the labels started . Not much more expensive than the originals , and I think it 's worth the extra couple bucks for the convenience . Printing comes out fine on the paper , as well .	1
These have never jammed my printer , are easy to peal off , and are strong enough to adhere to an envelope without worries .	1
The avery easy peel address labels are a good product . The easy peel thing make is easy to get off if it was hard for you before . It worked well in my cannon MX439 printer . I would buy this product again when I run out .	1
Great labels . I especially like the opaque nature of these white labels . If you make a mistake , you can just put another label on top of the previous one.Sticks great .	1
Avery labels are my favorite brand of labels . The work great on my laser printer . I use these to label my catalogs and other business supplies .	1
These easy peel labels ARE easy ! I also like the free cute templates on the avery.com/templates website . I chose a coffee grinder and also a bee motif . They are adorable and easy to use too . I did n't have any problems with bleeding , and the bee had several colors all over the label.They are great for Christmas cards or any other mass mailing , since the paper backing is perforated and you can tear it away so the labels hang off the end a little . I think they are sticky enough for everyday mailing on regular envelopes , and I print them up ahead of time to have on hand for bills and cards and things.They are a great price and do n't loose their stick , I think they are great ! Will definitely recommend them .	1
I used my entire package of these up already and have purchased these in the past several times last year to create labels for my classroom library . They align well , the ink does n't smudge once it dries a bit , and they adhere well . After spending hours designing classroom bin and book labels , I want labels that can stand up to 2nd graders . And my 2nd graders love to read . I only had one label come off ( in a year ) and it had to do with someone picking at it after it got wet and became smudged . While these are a bit more than the store brand in those big box stores , I 'd rather spend a bit more and have a product work .	1
I can always depend on Avery to give me a quality product . These little labels are what we use the most in our household . They are handy for everything . We use them with the free downloadable templates from their website so they are positioned accurately and look crisp and professional . You can just print one or a whole sheet ... and now the directions are right on the back of each sheet , very handy . If you collect boxtops for education , they are cleary displayed in an area that can easily be cut out without disturbing the contents.No jamming , yet each individual label is easier to pick up without dislodging the outside border . No problems.Highly recommended quality product .	1
Avery is a brand well known for labels etc and I have no complaints on this item . Arrived in gr8 condition , needed something fast and got it here with this order . Quality labels for the price . Recommended .	1
Our town 's energy committee recently had a project for which we needed about 250 peel-off labels . Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL ( compact fluorescent ) light bulbs free at our town 's community day ( sort of like a street fair ) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use . CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs . For the 250 bulbs , we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $ 0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $ 15,000 . There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labelswere a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee 's name . The question was how to get the information printed on the labels . At the Avery web site , I found free software , DesignPro , which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes . I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor laser printer labels , there were fourteen pre-made templates for the different size labels . I chose the template that matched my labels . Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint . I was able to cut and paste a graphics image , add the appropriate text , and choose a font for the text . A test run on my color laser printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels . The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up . I can never remember . After an up/down test , I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success . Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours . We had enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs . One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways . The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before . I am now a big fan of Avery labels , but I recommend getting the free software to make them work .	1
I had a chance to try a pack of these ( 08160 ) for free and figured what the heck -- I 'm always annoyed at having to fill in the return address.I was expecting to have to wrestle with MS Word or something to print the labels but actually you can just go to their website , which they list on the back of the label sheet [ ... ] . Tell it what label sheet you have ( 8160 in this case ) and it will help you create a design and fill in the information to print and then pop up a webpage and fire up a print job . It was as easy as could be . No download , no messing with Word or Adobe , just a website to visit.I did a test sheet on regular paper but it was right on the first try.I see another reviewer complained about the stickiness . I put a couple labels on a sheet of paper , pressed them firmly and let them sit for a minute and tried peeling them off . I had to pick at the edges to get it started but then it peeled off without much tearing of the paper underneath , so I have to agree that the glue could stand to be stronger . Still , for regular letter mail I ca n't imagine them coming off . For packages , which I imagine get more friction in the mail , I would probably not use these labels .	1
These labels are the usual kind . The service was fine . No problem with delivery . I rec 'd exactly what I ordered but I personally like the clear ones better .	1
These labels work great in an ink jet printer , but each label is very small ( 1 x 2+5/8 inches ) . There are two issues . First , getting your ink jet to align with the labels is hard because there is no flexibility . A slight feed error and the printing overflows on the next label , and the whole set of 30 labels must be thrown out . Second , even when you get these lined up perfectly , the label is very small . You can get three lines only- squeezing four lines requires type that is too small , or lines that are too closely spaced . I gave this 4 stars because the labels are well made and work as advertised . I took one star off because the labels are too small , and I do not understand why they would suggest these are good for address labels- they are simply too small for most applications , and simply too small to line up properly on a printer . The templates are fine . But my epson printer grabs them with a slight shift each time.In all other aspects , these are excellent ink jet labels . I tried them out in my laser printer , and it worked , but not well . So these must be used in an ink jet printer.Recommendation : Get the next size up unless you really need the small size for some reason .	1
Prints great with my Epson & they do n't jam in the printer . Sticks well on both letter envelopes & padded envelopes .	1
These are general use return address/locate labels . 1 inch by 2.625 . I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers , so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website . And , of course , Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning , so you can not loose buying these .	1
So far I have not had any problems with these labels but I only use them on envelopes for invitations and thank you 's . What I like about Avery products is that you can always find an exact template for their products for free on their website . These labels print well , no smudging , they feed through the printer without any problem and they seem to stick well . If you want a quality product , you always get that from Avery .	1
Having just moved , I have n't had a chance to try printing these yet , but have used a sharpie to mark them for storage containers . Good labels so far .	1
On occasion in the past , troubles have arisen as I attempt to run various labels thru the printers , mainly for mailing . These special labels just seem to flow right thru with a nice clean look , and no mix-ups anywhere in sight . So how can you beat that for labels ? Do n't know if you can !	1
I have had bad experiences with `` generic '' printable labels in the past ... namely , with the sheet getting stuck in my printer . So far , I have had no problems at all with these labels . They go through the printer smoothly . The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.If you go online to the Avery website , there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking .	1
These are so handy for mailing newsletters for our garden club . We use a Brother 640CW printer and the labelers work very well . Note these are for ink jet .	1
The fact that they offer the software online to customize and print all of the print stock they sell keeps me coming back for more !	1
I recently sent out a bunch of thank you cards and used these labels to do the addresses . I have used Avery products for years for various types of labels . The first thing I noticed was the recycle-logo on the back of the package - the package itself is made out of recycled paper and both the labels and the package are recycle-able ! Love that fact ! Then I noticed the changes to the label sheets themselves . Now , instead of covering the entire sheet with the sticky-back paper , the sheets now only have the label ( not the excess label paper around the actual labels ) so it is wasting less ! I printed a custom designed address label ( designed a graphic in Photoshop ) by using the free Avery software ( downloadable at Avery.com ) and they printed very nicely ! Plus - BIG plus - is that the labels are very easy to peel off the sheet to use ! Much easier ! Also , the Avery software is very easy to use - you can import your own images/photos/graphics or use some of their pre-made clip-art . you can also import mailing lists from Microsoft or print directly from Microsoft , Photoshop , Illustrator or InDesign by downloading the template you need from their website ! SO EASY ! I love printing out my own custom designs so I love using these labels !	1
I gave some of these to my daughter to use in her business mailings and she really likes them . She told me they were easy to peel once printed and she had no problems getting them through her printer . She did n't try sending them through the printer multiple times , so do n't know how well that would 've worked	1
These Avery Easy Peel Labels are another nice addition in a go-to line of Avery products . I have used their products in the past , and I have always been happy with their mailing labels . This product is no exception -- it is a great product too . Things to like:1 . Avery is now printing the directions on how to print your labels right on the back of each individual printer sheet , and I am so glad that they have done this . No more looking for the directions on how to format the printer -- they are right there on the sheet ( they are in English and Spanish ) . It also has an address to their web site and lists all the things you can design on their site . It also has the customer support 800 number printed on the front and back of each sheet should you run in to a problem . The Spanish version has telephone support numbers listed for Mexico , Venezuela , Brazil , and Chile.2 . A Pack of Freebies . Included in the labels pack is a four pack of Avery Repositionable Note Tabs . You can use them to mark textbooks and notebooks . A nice little bonus that gives you a chance to try a new product before you buy it.3 . Two `` Box Tops for Education '' coupons on the outside of the package -- easy to cut without ruining the integrity of the packaging . We save box tops in our house for the kids ' schools , so this was a nice little bonus for me.4 . The packaging these come is 100 % recyclable.5 . The labels are easy to print , the ink dries quickly , and come off the sheet very easily , yet stick nicely to an envelope or folder.I am very happy with these labels and would buy them again . Another great product from Avery .	1
I like my old HP 6840 deskjet printer . It just works and works . But the paper path flips the paper over . This is usually BAD for peel off labels . So , I was happy to try the avery easy peel labels for inkjet printers.These labels print cleanly , peel easily , and stick well . They do everything the label says , and everything a label should . I 'm full satisfied . Finally .	1
I print all my own address labels , and have done so for my at-home business for years . Lately I 've been noticing that some labels I buy do n't seem to work with the template given to use with them . I use The Print Shop Deluxe software for making up my labels , and when I designed some using the template I was told to use , they printed totally off-center and not in the right place , wasting a bunch of printer ink on unusable labels . This seemed to mostly happen with the new `` easy peel '' labels , which often had one product number but said on the package to use another product number template . I got very frustrated by this . I tried using an on-line Avery software , and had little better luck . I 'd pretty much almost decided no longer to print my own labels , but when given a chance to review this product , thought I 'd give it another try.Well , so far so good . I 've just printed up about 15 sheets of labels , and all printed precisely correctly . I have a fairly cheap HP inkjet printer , and it has printed them well . These are smaller labels than I usually use , as I like to put a picture on one side of the address , and these are a little too small to do that and also have room for a legible address , but that 's not the fault of the labels ! They are plenty big enough for an address that can be clearly read . The smaller size also allows lots of labels to be made from the one pack . So for now , my faith in Avery is restored !	1
This is an excellent product for home or office use . I tried this out for our home office , my husband 's business , and it was great.It is so easy to set up the label template in MS Word , and it worked with no problem . Or , as the package says , you can go to the Avery web site and down load their template ; however , it took me several tries on their website because I kept getting an `` unavailable '' message . But once I got through , it was easy to locate the template with their search button.The nice little touch that makes this sheet of labels different from other products is that the space between the labels on the sheet is notched . You do n't notice it at first , but the instructions say to `` bend at the column until the edge of the label pops up '' , and sure enough , that is exactly what happens.This is a very time saving and convenient way to get labels off the sheet without tears . Also , as advertised , I ran several sheets and none of them ever got caught in my printer - another wonderful convenience ! So , I highly recommend the Avery Easy Peel lables .	1
Avery products are a must for our home office as well as for work . I love the Easy Peel labels particularly because it truly is easy to peel off . I run several bulk mailings for church and these are the quickest way to get our labels done . They come out of the inkjet printer perfectly and worked in our photo copier too . I use this is conjunction with the Avery label software with seamless results .	1
I 've always had good experience with Avery products . They 're the big name in labels , business cards , etc . Using the big guy has its advantages , for one thing it 's very handy because most programs like Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org already have defaults for most sizes of their products . I have OpenOffice.org and it found the size easily . On the back of each sheet , there are instructions telling how to download the Avery Wizard for Microsoft Office . It also talks about their templates available on their website , however I 've never needed to use any ; I just use the ones in the word processor.You 'll pay a little more for them than the generics , obviously , but it 's not much more and it 's worth it . With the cheap ones if you put the label down a little crooked , it sets immediately and you tear apart the envelope and label trying to move it . These are a little more forgiving and can be adjusted somewhat . That 's a good feature for me . It 's also handy how easy the labels are to tear off . They do n't have the usual paper around the labels . It 's open so you can more easily pull them away from the sheet.The label paper is good quality . They 're for an ink jet printer and the ink did n't run at all when I used them . The sheets went through the printer smoothly with no issues . They correspond perfectly with the templates in the word processing programs I use , so printing out a sheet of labels is a simple and painless.I 'm quite happy with these and would happily recommend them or Avery business cards ( if you 're doing cards on the cheap ) .	1
Have n't used Avery labels for quite some time ; however , since i recently became treasurer of our HOA , it 's my duty to mail dues requests twice a year - labeling envelopes is never fun , but decided to try these labels ... in the past , picking the label off the sheet was a wearisome , repetitive task ... but now , with Avery 's redesign of its label sheets , a quick two folds of the printed sheet of labels , and label edges pop up - making the job of peel-and-place a *lot* easier ! Good job , Avery !	1
We use these labels for all of life 's major milestones . They 've been used for wedding invitation , wedding thank you 's , thank yous , birth announcements , christening invitations , and more . I would n't use anything else . Great quality . We use them in an HP inkjet printer .	1
These are a bit thicker than the generic labels I 've been using for a while . They are indeed easier to peel making short ( er ) work of large labeling tasks . No problems with jamming , smudging or sticking . They work perfectly in my HP printer . No complaints .	1
I 've tried all the cheap brands and Avery is still the best when it comes to these labels . They print cleanly and smoothly without jamming in the printer . They also adhere solidly to the surface which is important . Even if it 's a little more , I rather pay for this and have peace of mind knowing the labels are n't going to fall off somewhere . Good stuff .	1
Although I have had the opportunity to use other brands through the Vine program , I am still very pleased with the price and performance of the Avery brand of labels . I have never had an issue with these labels smudging or jamming in my laser printer . I use these not only for address labels , but also for frequently used notes on packages ( e.g . Fragile ) and to label file folder boxes as well . The templates to use create the data for the labels are included with Microsoft Word and make easy work out of getting them printed properly .	1
There is n't much to write about a standardized product such as labels . These are good quality , and they work well in our HP LJ2200D printer.They stick where you put them.Highly recommended .	1
Avery is the standard for computer printed labels , and have been for years . These laser labels print well , do n't smear , and stick well to envelopes.Why did I give them a 4* review ? Because I think this new `` Easy Peel '' label is a solution looking for a problem . I 've labeled thousands of envelopes ( I sell real estate and send out mailers on a regular basis ) , and I never had a problem with the old style label.These `` Easy Peel '' labels have a line where you fold the paper and the edge of the label sticks out making it easier to peel off . When I tried this , the top labels stuck out fine , but the sheet did n't quite fold on the line so the bottom labels did n't stick out as well . I 'm not sure that taking the time to fold the sheet 3 times to peel off the labels actually saves any time.I have n't done a major mailer with these labels yet , but I think the regular Avery labels are just as good .	1
As address labels these do everything you 'd expect them to do - you can print names and addresses on your printer , peel them off easily , and stick securey to envelopes . If your wordprocessor does n't have a template for them , one can be downloaded from [ ... ] .However I also used these labels for another purpose - organziing several closets . No longer do I have to remember which sheld the fitted king sized sheets are on and which is the fitted queen sheets - just print out what you need on these labels , stick them to the front of the shelves , and you 're done . ( Just use a nice large readable font ) . I reorganized the linen closet , hall closet , and basement closet using them and I could n't be happier .	1
These labels work perfectly . Labels are such a time and effort saver , and they are so versatile ; there are so many things you can do with them . I ca n't imagine living in a world without labels . These particular ones are for laser printers , but they can also be used just for writing on . They are easy to peel . They are address labels , but you can use them for a variety of different reasons . These labels are really awesome.Convenient , practical , good quality , and they make life easier . These labels can do so many things and you can use them for so many reasons - the list is endless.Highly recommended for office , home , school , workshop , playroom , etc . - the list is endless .	1
and yes , they are easy to peel off , have n't caused a printer jam , print nicely and sticks well . i do n't know what the difference is between the 5160 and 5260 because they seem to be the same size . from what i can tell , the only difference seems to be that the 5160 comes in a much larger pack ( 3000 labels ) than the 5260 ( 750 labels ) . so if you 're in need of many more labels than 750 , i 'd buy the 5160 instead of multiple packs of 5260. but for casual home users who do n't want 3000 labels ( that 's 100 sheets of labels - it 's a lot ) , the 5260 would be a better choice even though you spend more per label - buying in excess is more wasteful than paying for a smaller pack .	1
Found myself using these handy little strips for labeling all kinds of things ... you will too !	1
Avery makes some really great products . It 's certainly a name you can trust . These labels work great for my needs . I also love the available downloads from the Avery website . I 've had nothing but a pleasant experience with this item and getting the job done.The price seems to be pretty reasonable . I would also like to add that the price on Amazon is , I think , a little bit cheaper than what I have paid in the past at a couple of different office supply stores ( not to mention any names ) .	1
These are your world famous Avery 5160 style labels . It is so well known , apparently , that `` 5160 '' is a registered trademark ... interesting.TESTINGMy first tests with with an HP OfficeJet Pro K5400 and HP DeskJet 5650 . Yes , these are inkjet printers and this is supposed to be a pack of laser labels . Despite that fact , the labels performed very well . Large text and small text are both clear and crisp with minimal ability to smear ( not any more than any other paper ) .In my test with an HP LaserJet 4050 , it went through the printer perfectly and the printed labels look terrific.FEATURESThe `` Pop-up Edge '' for fast peeling is useful . This is by no means unique , as 3M has the same thing in their labels , but it is useful for quickly pulling labels off . It works by having a perforation strip under the right edge of each label column , so you can fold the sheet and the edge of the label will stick out and be ready to pull off.ADHESIVENESSAs for the adhesiveness , it is a moderate stick -- you can carefully peel it off once you stick it on , but it will not go anywhere if stuck on paper.As you would expect from Avery , these are very high quality labels good for home or office that have stood the test of time .	1
These labels are nice . They remove from the backing very easily as promised . I gave he product 4 stars because there are 750 in a package , so for business that might be fine , but personal use 750 labels will last a lifetime . Avery does make a quality product that prints up very nicely in most printers . I would recommend this product .	1
These work like a charm if you use the corresponding template . M printer is hardly the latest model but still works so I really appreciate that the lables do n't get stuck in the printer . Other good points : the ink does not smudge and they are easy to peel and stick .	1
Side-by-side comparison:3M Address Labelsare just as good , and usually less expensive . Go for the better price.I 've used Avery and 3M labels for years.The 3M have the same easy-peel layout , without the laughable salesmanship.The 3M package claims `` Permanent Adhesive '' and `` Strong Stick . '' The Avery stick just as well , or almost as wellI find the 1 '' x 2-5/8 '' size is big enough if you use size 9 font ( Arial ) . I get up to 38 characters per line x 5 lines .	1
I like to print address labels and these are wonderful . They peel off easily but do n't jam up the printer . I highly recommend them for home offices and for people who need to print labels at home .	1
Another effective Avery office product that 's relatively easy to use . Works fine with our home ( Panasonic ) and office ( HP ) laser printers ( I did n't bother trying the labels with our ink-jet printers ) . Avery provides FREE templates for Microsoft Word and also their own Design and Print Online . It was easy to print out address labels for our clients . Just make sure the printing is aligned properly with the labels . The Pop-up Edge feature ensures effortles peeling of the labels . There were no smudging . Avery has kept it simple and useful .	1
These are easy to use and I only had to use 2 sheets of plain paper to get them aligned . It works fine with my cannon printer but I prefer to put them in 1 at a time . I did n't have a problem with these but I one had a problem with the printer taking more than one sheet then it wanted to jam.I like the size they are big enough to clearly see the address but not too big to take up too much space.I several pages with return addresses and I will save some for addressing envelopes at Christmas time .	1
These are simple to use . An easy download into Word and they printed great . The peel was easy and looked amazing on the envelopes !	1
If you are accustomed to office store brand labels which are simply incised through the top layer of peel-and-stick paper , you are in for a pleasant surprise with these labels from Avery . The user only needs to bend the paper at each vertical row and the labels stick up on the ends for easy removal . These are also comparably priced to the office store brands in a similar quantity . So given the choice , buying these more convenient to use labels is a no brainer . At this writing , though , I could not find these in large quantities , so the office store brands can still beat these in price in large quantities . Nevertheless , I recommend these and feel the ease of use saves enough time to warrant additional expense for larger quantities .	1
I have been using Avery 5260 address labels for years . They are perfect for addressing envelopes , labeling files , and even captioning photos in albums . Avery labels are easy to use , rarely smudge , and peel off easily . The package contains 25 sheets , 30 labels per sheet for a total of 750 labels . Avery address labels are handy for home , school , or office use and work well with most printers . Highly recommended .	1
I got a laser printer and wanted to try out the laser version of these address labels . They are great ! Print great and stick great . And they are easier to remove than they used to be . I use address labels for addresses ( obviously ) , but also for all sort of things . Mainly labeling things . But you 'll be surprised at how versatile these can be !	1
Avery is a brand that has been doing laser labels for as long as I can remember and they put out a very nice product . This particular size , the 5260 is the perfect size for address labels for envelopes . Three columns , ten long means you get 30 labels to a sheet.Easy peel off , easy printing with no jams . The perfect label.The nice thing about Avery is that it works seamlessly with Microsoft Office . In word they have templates for all the Avery laser labels and you just have to select which one you are using and the blank template just pops up . Sometimes with generic brands , this is not the case and you have to manually set your parameters which while doable for a regular MS Word user could prove to be quite an obstacle for the casual user.I highly recommend these labels to anyone . They will not give you trouble .	1
I have been using Avery mailing labels for quite a while . I was successfully printing addresses on Avery 8160 labels in both ink jet and laser printers , so I was puzzled when I found the Avery 5260 labels designed specifically for laser printers . The only difference I detected is the strip of label paper along the left edge of the page of labels . I suppose this helps prevent jamming in laser printers , but I never experienced jamming with the 8160 nor 5260 labels.I have switched to laser printing exclusively because the cost per page is so much lower with the lasers printers and the ink never smudges once it leaves the fuser.The bottom line on this is , I will probably continue buying the Avery 5260 labels .	1
. .for just about anything . I use these 1 ) to label my chargers and wires that seem to multiply on their own in the drawer . 2 ) Put reminders on . . .just about anything . 3 ) Little notes for my hubby that wo n't get lost or blow away . 4 ) Of course , for files , papers , notes . Easy to remove from the backing . I do n't do mail merge , but that 's what their made for . Be creative .	1
Overall these are very good labels and my complaint does n't really count since they directions say not to run the sheet of labels through the printer more then once , but I do . With the easy peel labels the sheet tends to get stuck a little more in the printer then before , but it 's not a ton . And I reuse sheets because really , I 'm not wasting a whole sheet for 2 or 3 addresses ! Besides that I 've never had a problem with these labels smudging or not sticking , I 've always been pleased with Avery labels .	1
Labels are bright and peel easily . They adhere well to my crushed velvet and make a great presentation . Easy to use .	1
I 've been using Avery 's 5267 product to make return address labels for some time now , but despite the increasing quaintness of postal mail , I still have a few people and companies that I mail things to every so often , so tried out Avery 's 5260 address labels for laser printers to print up some address labels . They just work.If you have n't used this type of product , it 's a breeze if you have almost any working version of Microsoft Word , because Word has built-in templates for Avery 's various labels . Just open or create a document , type in the address you want on the label , select Mailings/Labels ( in Word 2007 - varies by version ) , tell it that you want to use Avery 5260 labels , and Word knows how to lay out the page and to replicate the text 30 times to fill out a page of identical labels . Or you can give Word a list of addresses from a mailing list and it will lay them out to fit on the Avery product.This appears to be a new generation of Avery 's line of labels , with `` pop-up edges '' to make it easier to peel each label from the page , as compared to older versions which required you to bend the page or pry out each label with your fingernails . Amazing how it 's possible to improve even a seemingly mundane product.Anyway , these just work and I do n't even think about them when creating or using them - which to me is the definition of usefulness and quality .	1
No smudging , no pulling off the sheet when printing , and they come off easily when desired . No complaints on these labels .	1
I purchased these since some other brands I had purchased were not sticking to the envelopes well , and the laser ink on them actually was not sticking well at all . This brand , so far , is working OK . I have n't done a super critical test yet . But the printer is a high grade Brother semi-commercial , so I am sure the fusing is not the fault of the printer itself .	1
I 've been using the Avery products for years and this is just as good as most of their other products . The thing to remember is to use the proper template and to run a trial through your printer first . Sometimes your printer runs the pages through crooked and you do n't want to waste the stickers if they are going to come out crooked .	1
Great labels . Easy to use . Did n't come off in my laser printer . Very happy with product	1
I 've used lots and lots of labels over the years and believe the Avery Easy Peel Address Labels a great value for the money . Of course , you can also use them with inkjet printers , etc . Check it out .	1
I do n't know how Avery continues to improve on products that seem to work so well , but they manage to find ways to tweak their labels to make them even easier to use.These labels work as promised - no jamming in my printer , the print is legible and clean , and the labels peel off like magic . I 've used Avery products for years and I 'm never disappointed . These labels are no exception . They zip out of my printer in a jiffy , and the labels are great to use on all sorts of packaging . I ship a lot of things in the craft bubble mailers , and these labels stick like a charm .	1
These meet my basic requirements extremely well : - They come off the printer cleanly , without jamming.- They do n't smudge.- Peeling them off the backing is simple and clean.- And they adhere nicely to the envelope.They work great !	1
This is yet another great label product by Avery . Of course it works with Avery 's DesignPro template software . I used these in a HP LaserJet printer and had no issues with smudging -- all the print was clear . The only thing I did not like was the pop-up edge for fast peeling . It works great if you print a full sheet of labels each time , but occasionally I only need to print a few labels and when the sheet goes through the printer a few times it can start to separate easily . Not a big deal , just something to be aware of if you only print a few labels at a time . I would recommend these labels and I would buy them again !	1
Yes , these labels are just as they are described , but even better than I expected.From past experience with printing labels , I figured I 'd have to spoil a few sheets to `` get the system zeroed-in . `` I was wrong . I clicked on my label options , selected the appropriate Avery label number , and voila ! printed my first sheet of labels -- which were perfect.As they advertise , the labels are also extremely easy to peel , so I 'm very pleased and will reorder these labels again and again .	1
Make note that this product is for laser printers ! Great product for office or at home use . If you have a mass mailing to do , you will find Avery templates and labels extremely useful . These products come with Easy Peel technology to make sticking the labels on envelopes even easier . Anytime you have to print labels , look to these Avery labels . A good value for your money . You can address 750 envelopes with just one package . Do you know how much time mail merge , a printer , and some avery labels will save you . You wo n't be disappointed !	1
So far so good ... I print a few labels at at time on a page so I may often put the same sheet back in my printer several times . Not having the white column separation paper in between the columns helps eliminate the chance of jamming . Removing a label from the page is easy and trouble free . For my type of use it seems a good choice . Thumbs up !	1
Avery has done it again ! Been using their product for years and I think these are a good improvement over prior functionality.I did use the template and verified that the printing surfaces were clean and ready to go prior to use . In this way , the labels printed smoothly and easily . There was not smudging . The labels did not get stuck in the printer.As the sheet includes just labels ( no margins ) , they peeled off easily and could be subsequently appliedquickly and neatly to the envelopes . The finished look was neat and very professional and ready for mailing.Overall , these are terrific address labels for any user .	1
I use labels on a regular basis , be it in the office or at home . My number one brand of choice is always Avery . Now Avery has enhanced the labels by making them smudge proof and easy to peel . When ever I have a big job and have to peel over 100 labels ... you better believe I want a label that can peel easily and quickly and this product delivers just what I want . Some may think a label is just a label , but not so . If you want the best of the best , buy Avery .	1
If you have a home business or non-profit , these labels are helpful . And they do n't clog the printer . And they peel off easily . I have found uses for labels I did n't know about -- the bins in the basement of old toys , LPs , pictures of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert before they were funny . Labels are a wonderful way to save time and trouble . And these labels really are that .	1
I do catalog mailings about once a month at work , we 're a small company so I do the job from start to finish , stuffing and sealing envelopes , printing labels , attaching labels and running postage.The two things that take the longest in this process are stuffing the envelopes and peeling the labels to stick on the envelopes . This product does n't solve both of these , but it sure takes care of one of them ! These labels worked flawlessly in our printer , then just bend the backing and the edges of each label are there and ready to be peeled.Cut my labeling time nearly in half ! I was a bit concerned that `` easy peel '' would mean `` not sticky '' , but the labels adhered nicely to the envelopes , with no corner lifting at all.Great product !	1
i ordered these labels because of the features promised : the Pop-up Edge ( tm ) for fast peeling and jam-free and smudge-free labels every time . i like how they perform -- they do indeed pop up easily when you bend the paper they are stuck to , and they print on very nicely . i also use them for writing by hand as multipurpose labels for photos , folders , books and binders to organize my files .	1
These are good , standard solid labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package ( so helpful ) and I 've used both the 3M version , Avery version , and branded store versions ( like Office Depot ) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose , I 'd make your decision based on price , and features such as the Easy Peel ( which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings , wedding/shower invitations , etc ) ... as well as other features like ( is it for a LASER or INKJET ) printer ? Is it the right adhesive ( does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using ) ... I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands , but Avery has been making good labels for a long time , so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process !	1
I rarely download templates for labels . I use the built-in mail merge in Word and it already supports pretty much every label made - including this one ( 5260 . ) I 've been using Avery labels for over a decade , and this latest generation is a marked improvement . The biggest pain with previous labels was removing the label from the rest of the sheet - you know , the remainder after the labels were removed . These labels do n't have that `` remainder '' - just the labels . It makes peeling off the labels easier , cleaner and faster.They fed fine on my laser printer and inkjet.People that complain about smudging on the 1st page need to clean the printer more often with a cleaning sheet , or pre-feed heavier stock . Labels are pretty thick ! Little fuzzies , pet hair ( yes , I have found pet heir in my inkjet print head ) and the like may not cause problems with normal paper . But put in card stock , photo paper or labels - you can have a mess . That 's why I 'll always print a small color block on a piece of card stock BEFORE using labels , or use card stock as the first print as a test . It 's a lot cheaper than wasting a sheet of labels ! Feeding : I always print test pages . For example my laser printer has three drawers and a manual bypass . One drawer requires the labels be down . Two drawers need them facing up . Manual bypass facing down , and tail-end in first . Envelopes are even more confusing . With paper this is not a concern , with labels it always is.Here 's a tip . Take a piece of paper . Use a pen and write TOP on the paper . Flip it over , write BOTTOM . Then draw an arrow on one edge- the edge that goes in the printer first . Print a sheet of `` labels '' on this paper . Examine it . Scratch your head . The results are often confusing - but will save you a ton of headaches .	1
There 's enough separation between labels to avoid printer run over . You wo n't go wrong with this high quality Avery product .	1
These print very well , did n't jam my printer . Just bend the sheet a little and the edge of the label pops up for easy removal from the sheet . Sticks very well , does n't seem like it would have a problem coming off , in the mail .	1
This is a VINE review.As with other Avery products I 've purchased , these laser labels are worth every penny . The paper is solid , the labels peel easily , the sheets do n't clog my printer , and they work perfectly for making address ( or other kinds of ) labels . On top of this , they have free templates on their website , which are quick and easy to use.I 'm quite sure I 'll never purchase any other brand . I highly recommend these labels .	1
These labels are great - good quality , the ink does n't run on them , and they peel off easily from the backing.They are a nice , bright white and are suitable for professional use .	1
If you have a mailing list in the hundreds , anything that shaves a little bit of time on the boring and repetitive parts of the project is very welcome . This new `` easy peel '' design could n't be easier to use . You just bend the column every so slightly and you get an easy to grab edge that allows you to peel off each label without having to grab a corner by nudging with your fingernail , over and over again -- even after going through the heat of a laser printer . I have found them to feed through smoothly ( only one sheet at a time ) , not get jammed , not have one of the label corners accidentally adhere to the roller or feed dogs of the printer ( yes , this has happened to me and it 's a nightmare I 'm glad to be able to put behind me ) . They work like a charm.NOTE TO AVERY : As much as I have loved these labels , I STILL have a slight objection . It has nothing to do with either quality , functionality , or design . It has to do with size . These one-inch high labels easily accommodate a three-line address . A four-line address fits . However , if you want to take full advantage of your word processor 's capabilities and add a zip bar code line ( which really DOES work in getting your mail delivered faster ) , you can fit it in on the three-line address , but it gets cut off on the four-line address.If you have a longer address structure , you 're absolutely doomed . For example : I have several unmarried couples on my list . They each require a line . ( Mr. John Smith , Ms. Mary Jones ) . I also mail some company executives , and this becomes a nightmare : Mr. John Smith , PresidentThe ACME Company1234 Main Street , Suite 5City , State , Zip//////bar code////////.This address does not fit on a 1 '' label.This makes creating a large mailing a real problem . I print the whole list ( 800+ ) in this label , then discard the ones that did n't fit and re-do them manually on label # 05163 , which are the next size up but , at 2 '' x 4 '' they are really to BIG . ( # 5962 which is 1 1/3 '' high does n't provide that much of an improvement and it 's still 4 '' wide ! ) Please , Avery , make a 1.5 '' x 3 '' label to accommodate the longest names and titles and the longest addresses and not look horrible on the envelope -- and make them Easy Peel , just like this one .	1
I like to use my laser printer to print labels for Christmas cards each year . It is so much easier to load a sheet of labels and print a bunch of address labels rather than hand-write the address on each envelope . I have used other laser printer labels for this purpose in the past , but they were an off-brand and somewhat difficult to configure with Microsoft Word . These Avery labels are easy to use . [ ... ] . has free software available that makes printing on their labels quick and easy . These particular labels use their 5160 template even though the box says 5260 on it . You can print 30 labels per sheet . As advertised , each is easy to remove.If you are looking for white labels for use on a laser printer , these are perfect for addressing envelopes . They are sized small enough that they could be used for labeling other things such as small storage boxes , CD boxes , etc . although I 'm sure their major use is intended for envelopes . They are cumbersome to use if you only want to generate a few labels at a time , but if you need them in large quantity , this is the way to go .	1
What can I say . They are very good labels . Peel off easy . Stick well . Do n't smear when printed on . Does n't jam up my printer . Ca n't think of anything else they would be need to do so 5 stars from me !	1
These 1 '' x 2 5/8 '' labels have many uses . I 've been using them for quite a while , and they 've always performed perfectly . They stick well and they do n't smudge.Also , although Avery says that each sheet should only go through a printer once , who works like that ? I 've done sheets printing one label at a time , with no problems at all . If you do that , I 'd recommend starting with the bottom row of labels and working your way up . Of course , your laser printers might be different from mine , so your mileage might vary.The labels now have a `` Pop-up Edge '' for easy peeling , but I have n't used it , since I usually print one label at a time . The pop-up edge facilitates peeling of an entire column of labels at once . However , I 've never had the slightest bit of trouble peeling labels off individually.They are excellent labels , and Avery offers software and/or templates to make it easy to print on them .	1
These are terrific `` every day '' labels . I 've tried them on both my laser and inkjet printers and have had no issues with smudging or jamming.The labels are thick enough that they do n't appear see through . They hold ink well . The adhesive is very strong-no worries that the labels will peel off in the mail.I highly recommend these for you everyday no frills address labels .	1
like the clear mailing labels a lot ... usually more expensive than the white ones but look much nicer on oft colored envelopes ... got these on a offer of buying 3 getting 1 free ...	1
Use these all the time . Love them . Great value when bought on Amazon . Can be a tish hard to pull off , but if you bend the backing paper , they come off like a charm .	1
These worked great for us . We pasted them on light parchment envelops and they disappeared . The ink was nice and crisp coming out of the printer . They were ok to remove from the sheet and adhere . Nice product .	1
I love Avery labels , and always find a good deal on Amazon . The work great on my laser printer . I use them to label my catalogs and other business supplies , they work great .	1
Came as described . The template is easy to use for mailing labels . They are a little small , so maybe get the next biggest size if you are looking for something more significant than a return address label .	1
on envelopes , peels easily . If there is a problem , it is that it 's very difficult to center things because if you 're typing , it 's hard to see where the individual labels are .	1
They work well in my Canon multifunction printer scanner . If it did n't work I would n't order the4 same thing again . Only complaint is that the one edge seems to pull away from the backing paper before I 'm ready for it .	1
These labels are ideal for my printer and easy to peel off . I would recommend them to anyone in the market for these types of labels .	1
I like the size and quality of these note cards . Made up invitations to a 70th birthday party for a friend and everyone thought they were professionally made . Highly recommend .	1
We bought these to use for Christmas cards . They are very nice , so much better than the quad fold cards . We were very impressed with them . Nice to have the envelopes that fit them too . I will buy them again .	1
We use these in our business to send thank you notes to our customers with our own custom design on our color ink jet printer . I always get them in a couple of days and really like the quality .	1
I use these Note Card sheets for printing all my greeting cards . For Christmas cards , thank you cards , get well cards , etc ... I subscribe to a greeting card membership that allows me to make my own cards ... to edit the verses , and to even modify the designs . I use these ALL THE TIME for all my cards . They are great . I have both size sheets to make the 4 '' x 5 '' cards and to make the larger cards of 5 '' x 8 '' . Amazon supplies me with the material , and I make the cards.. it is FUN and I even get to add my name to the cards too . Avery is the best product for making cards . Their paper is QUALITY and Avery makes ALL types of paper to print your cards on ... Thank you Avery and thank you Amazon .	1
I use these to print out my art work . They are sturdy and I print on both sides . I only wish that they came with a glossy side . I 'm sure there would be a demand for them .	1
I use these in my home based small business . They are a fine product and I have no complaints about them . They are both professional looking and inexpensive ... these are a basic , easy to use product .	1
These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You , Invitation , X-mas cards etc . etc . Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers , I have used them in Dell , Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site . The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages . Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site . The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site . As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card . Not bad.Bottom line - good product , saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card .	1
Ca n't beat this price for 700 labels . Works perfectly in my Dymo LabelWriter 400 . I have not experienced any of the issues reported by other users such as labels not printing due to no black markings on the reverse side of the label . Nor have I had any issues with them not being sticky enough . It will take a while for me to go through these . I do n't print a lot of labels . But I will definently purchase again .	1
Great labels for a great little machine . I prefer the DYMO Brand of labels as opposed to the off brand name . What more can one say !	1
I use these all the time . Solid product that works as advertised . No jams no problems just solid , trouble free , everyday performance for label printing . I use them for address labels and for labels for file folders and other items for which I want a label..	1
I use these in my Dymo LabelWriter 400 Turbo and they do the trick nicely . Easy to load and they print out crisp and clear text .	1
We have a Dymo label printer . The label quality is perfect . We constantly run labels for Fed-Ex & USPS . The labels stick & ink does n't smudge .	1
Perfect addition to any dymo label maker ... makes those sheets of address labels seem like a thing of the past !	1
Perfect for my Dymo Label Writer 450 . Good quality . Just what I wanted at a good price . I could n't find these locally .	1
These Dymo are the best product to use in a Dymo labelwriter . I 've used other cheaper brands and they are not as white and look cheap . Go with true Dymo .	1
These are awesome , however I 'm going to look for cheaper labels , as I found ones for the 4XL printer that were the same quaity but 20 % cheaper .	1
This is a great product and is what I wanted . Just sucks I have to buy my own supplies for work .	1
Check the size before buying	1
DYMO brand labels are more expensive than generic labels . A lot more expensive sometimes . However , I burned through 2 DYMO label printers with inferior generic brand labels . They got the machine jammed up and caused the entire machine to burn out and fail . Generic labels caused me a big headache and lost money and time . I still like my DYMO printer , but I learned my lesson the hard way . Spend the extra money on DYMO brand labels . Yes , they are probably charging a little too much , but it is what is . The labels are high quality and wo n't ruin your printer .	1
The machine has been in service for a long time and has performed flawlesslywith the use of Dymo original labels . Highly recommended .	1
I 've bought a lot of labels over the years , and I find that the original Dymo brand labels are always the nicest/brightest/whitest . If you want nice bright/white labels , this is the best option in my opinion .	1
I have used my Dymo label printer for a number of years , and am very pleased with it . The labels work well and the output is excellent ... ..what more can I say ? ?	1
There really is n't much to say : assuming you have decent label printing software , these labels label . After a couple of months they seem to stick in place in contrast with other products I 've used .	1
Avery File Folder Labels are fast and easy to use . The paper is nice quality and they are easy to peel off . It works well on my ink jet printer and states it works with laser printers too . The labels are on acid free paper . I like that the labels are not side by side connected together like some labels I have used in the past but the labels have spaces between them ( side by side ) so they come off easy . The labels are close together on top and bottom but they do n't stick together . Has anyone used labels like I had where the labels hang together or stick to the paper when peeled off ? Ugh , I hate that . This one will not do that.I also like that it came with four free samples of Avery Note Tabs that was a pleasant bonus . Another great feature Avery has is free templates online for Microsoft Word and an Avery Design and Print . Going online , I found 44 templates listed for the file folder labels but about a handful of templates that will work with these specific file labels . They are basic but get the job done and look good printed out . Another freebie is the Avery Wizard for Microsoft Word for more creating . I use Wordperfect X5 and the templates work fine in it . I have yet to explore the other software listed but I just thought it was a great added bonus for using their templates . I will buy from Avery because they not only give quality labels , but go the extra distance and give more to boot .	1
I 've long been a fan of Avery products . Every time I buy an off-brand just to save a few cents , I always end up with paper jams or unusable smudged , smeared , or incorrectly placed labels . Avery products are always well-made and supported by every device that I use in my office . The Avery File Folder Labels are no exception.Speaking of software and formats , even if the program you have does n't support Avery ( I ca n't imagine which one that would be ... ) you can go to their website and download templates or even use their website to print ! ( This one is great because our office includes not only PC 's but also several Linux machines ) .Lastly , I was happily surprised to see the inclusion of 2 `` Box Tops '' . My children 's school does an excellent job of collecting these and turning them in . It is nice to finally see these great incentives on products other than snack food.When is a label not just another label ? When it 's an Avery label ! : )	1
Since I usually print only one label at a time , I 'm pleased a sheet will go through the printer many times correctly . I 've used various software programs for printing these labels and they always come out looking great , plus a single sheet does n't seem to be affected by the heat from the laser printer and even after many trips through , the labels still release cleanly , then stick well to the intended surface . Even better , they can be removed cleanly when no longer needed.I use them for file folders as intended , but also for jars of stored goods in the kitchen . These may be multiple jars of the same thing , e.g . jelly , or one jar of a newly ground spice . I 've given up thinking I 'll remember what 's in all those little spice jars . There 's plenty of room on these labels for the name of the contents and the date.I do n't always use the printer . I keep a sheet of the labels in the kitchen for quick labeling and just write on them with a pen or marker . When I reuse the jar , the labels peel off in one piece and do n't leave an annoying residue.My latest labor saver is to write the name of a device on one end of the label and fold it in half over the cable that device uses so there 's no more guessing which cable goes to the scanner and which to the camera , etc . etc . That worked so well , I labeled all my stored chargers so I now know which is which and do n't have to try multiple plugs to get a fit . Some things do n't need charging often enough for me to remember which of the dozen little corded black boxes is the right one . I 've seen tags you can buy for this purpose , but why spend the money when these labels work so well . In addition , if the cord is much longer than it needs to be I include several loops when I fold the label over it , effectively shortening it to a more manageable length.Now I 'm beginning to label various items in my home discretely on the bottom or back to aid my kids when they inherit it all . My daughter suggested it since she feared she would n't remember the details and dates of Great Uncle Sam 's baby cup and like items . Because the labels stick well , but release cleanly they seemed a good choice for this labeling . If they are too big , I cut them in half . With the printer you can get a lot of info on the label.I 'm really pleased with this size and the quality and will re-buy . Highly recommended for multiple uses .	1
These file labels are part of a growing list of innovative office products being introduced by Avery and they are really worth the extra cost.The labels are acid free and utilize `` TrueBlock Technology '' that allows you to place a label over an existing one on a file folder and there is no bleed through ... the label absolutely covers everything under it . Like most other reviewers I tend to try to use and reuse file folders and have at one time or another resorted to writing over labels with magic markers or sharpies or sticking labels over others to the extent that the folder looks , well less than professional.While I do not use the labels in my printer these come with free software online and templates that are easy to use.An added bonus is the generous Box Tops for Education coupons on each package . Since we have teachers in the family and grandchildren in school we are aware of the amount of money your school can earn by saving these coupons . It is not the primary reason I like these labels but is a tipping point when considering buying something , all things being equal.These labels are amazing in that they actually do what the manafacturer says they will do ... completely cover up old labels and writing and allows the reuse of file folders.Highly recommended .	1
I recently went through my filing cabinet and purged all of the old crap that was cluttering the drawers . The problem is that I now had a stack of very usable folders that were `` tattooed '' by the old labels . You ca n't tear the old labels off without damaging the tab and if you put new labels over them the writing on the old label shows through.These new Avery File Folder Labels are absolutely perfect for this situation : you can place them over old labels and they completely block out the writing on the old labels . Problem solved ! ! Nice and heavy-duty , these are excellent labels.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful . If you 'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day , so if you have a question or comment ( even if it 's just to say , Hi ! '' ) feel free to post it below.Thanks , Claire	1
I like to print labels for my file folders so they are easier to read . These labels go through the printer well and attach to file folders securely . They are great !	1
I 'm starting my own business and these are working out perfect for setting files up for my clients . Avery does a good job on all of their products .	1
To me , Avery is like the standard when it comes to printing labels . The reason I say this is not only because of their high quality labels and products , but because when you buy it , you 're pretty much guaranteed to find a template already in your office productivity software ( e.g . MS Word/Excel ) . Avery now has the added feature of being able to design the labels directly from their website and print ( Go to their website , and then click on `` Design & Print . '' Avery is truly going the extra mile to make the process of printing labels as simple as possible.I 've been using Avery labels for years , and they continue to improve upon their already excelent products . This product in particular adds a special feature that they call 'Trueblock Technology ' . For most people , this would seem like trivial . A label is a label , whats the point ? For those of you that want to re-use old folders , and completely mask the previous label/marking , this label does the trick . After printing out a sheet of labels , I placed them over folders with permanent markers markings , old printed labels , pens , and more . On regular labels , you may be able to see faint outlines of what was written before . With these labels , I was unable to detect any previous marking . Works as advertised ! There are 25 sheets of labels , each with 30 labels , for a total of 750 labels . Whether you print or write directly on these file folder labels , what amounts to less than 3 cents per label , you ca n't go wrong with this . Unlike some of their other labels , this particular one worked well with my Epson Photosmart printer as well as my ancient HP LaserJet 8150 ( If your printer has the option to , be sure to specify that you are printing on a label versus a regular sheet of paper ) .Needless to say , I highly recommend this product .	1
One of my summer projects was to file , re-file , and re-organize existing files . Not the most pleasant task in the world . One of the things I wanted to avoid this time around was my messy hand written tab titles for the hanging folders.Voila ! These Avery computer generated tab title thing-a-me-bobs are exactly what was needed ! Download the template , type the titles , print out and attach- could n't be easier.I love it when simple products perform their designated task well and make my life just a little bit easier .	1
These are easy to use , either with a computer template -- even available for Macs -- or to write on by hand . They do cover all that 's underneath , remove easily from the master sheet . I 'll probably buy themwhen the sample set is used up . I find most Avery products a good value and well made .	1
I am giving this product 5 stars because the feeding instructions ( for printing ) were very clear , the template was easy to find in Word , and the print quality was good.What else could I want ? I used these to update my business cards with twitter information , and they worked great .	1
One of the things mentioned on the package of these file folder labels is that they have `` TrueBlock Technology '' . Well I could n't wait to find out if that was true . I have been making file folders for my home office files by reusing old folders from our business . I have usually used a felt tip pen to write the name on the folder . That is not a very attractive way to set up a system , but I tried some old file folder labels and the previously printed title just bled right through . I had a ready made experiment for these new labels and I 'm very glad to say that they did truly block the writing underneath and it did not bleed through at all . Now my personal files look like I actually took some time to set them up correctly ( or at least `` correctly '' as per my definition ) .The Avery Company has made available free templates and software to use with their products . I had to give them my name and email address in order to access the templates I was looking for . The good thing is that the templates will help me utilize the labels more efficiently . These labels are for both laser and ink jet printers and are acid free . Included in this package was a sample pack of four repositionable note tabs . I 've used those in the past and absolutely love them . Thanks Avery for the reminder that I need to pick up more of those .	1
I always feel like office supplies in general are over priced . However Avery products have always been great quality . I have never had a problem with anything from them and this product was no different .	1
I love to reuse file folders . I know , file folders are pretty cheap and why bother ? Well , convenience is the main reason and not being wasteful , maybe , that 's the other . Anyway , I 've developed that habit over the years and I 've used my share of `` tricks '' to do it which include turning the folder inside out and using the other side of the tab , liquid paper , correction film , and stick-on labels . Labels have become the preferred choice for me and that is where these improved Avery ones with their super opaque cover technology shine.Avery labels are simply the best brand you can buy . A label is n't something that can not be improved upon and Avery continues to be the leader in the finish of the actual label , the adhesives , and their `` TrueBlock Technology '' which makes the label 100 % opaque to anything under it . No more `` x-ray '' vision of the previous writing , or previous label , underneath makes for a neat job of folder presentation . They feed flawlessly through all my printers , and if only printing a single the sheets will hold up extremely well for repeated trips through . The quality is top-notch and you can use a fine point sharpie to write on and it is still crisp without the fattened bleed look to your written labels . The adhesive never curls and I have even been able to remove them with care to simply put a new label on when I 've had several to build up.This particular size is truly versatile too . I 've used them as labels on so many different items that I am addicted to having these on hand . You can use them not just in the office , but for lots of creative labeling . You can label audio/video cables by wrapping them around the cable , price sundry items if you have a business , label dates on items stored in your fridge or freezer , put a date you opened something such as olive oil so you know it is still usable , the list goes on . They stick and they remain readable under and/or heavy use conditions . These labels are worth the money and you may find yourself addicted too . Recommended with no reservations .	1
I 'll go into more detail about what 's superior about Avery below , but first , regarding this size -- These will fit three lines of 10 point Arial , or one line of something bigger . I use them regularly at work for their intended purpose , and I also use them at home to label stuff going into the freezer . They do stay on even when frozen , but are easiest to remove while still frozen . If they get wet before I try to remove the label , some adhesive has to be scrubbed off.I doubt Avery matters for the freezer application , but if you want a professional result for more traditional uses , Avery and name brand printer toner are a must.I 've tried several different generic brands -- from all three big office retailers -- and the letters get smeared or flake off when applying the labels . Add generic toner , and the problem gets so bad that the printing becomes almost illegible . With generic toner these smear a little bit , but with the name brand toner ( I 've used these in both HPs and Canons ) , there 's no problem . The generic labels might seem a lot cheaper , but these are well worth the extra dough.As far as True Block goes , well , I do n't really care , but it does work . The labels have an opaque backing between the paper and adhesive , which does n't allow anything below it to show through . I usually just remove the label if I 'm going to re-use a file folder , because I 'm just going to covering up the damaged area with another label anyway . True Block seems more useful for shipping applications than for file folders . I do n't know whether or not Avery is selling these labels in a non-True Block form , but if so , it may be worth looking closely at price .	1
I am very satisfied with these labels . They are easy to work with and look great .	1
The TrueBlock technology works really well . I had some folders with old labels that I had written on with Sharpies and ballpoint pen . I have tried using other labels to cover the old writing , but I could always see through them - especially the labels that I had written on with marker . These folder labels blocked out the old writing completely.Avery 's website also has some really nice free online tools to create quick templates for printing labels - no downloads required . I used the `` Design and Print Online '' feature to create a sheet of labels on my MacBook , then I printed the sheet on my Brother laser printer . It worked really well . It took me less than 5 minutes to get my labels typed in , choose a font , and get them printed using the manual sheet feeder on my printer . It was impressively easy .	1
As a teacher , you quickly learn how to recycle and reuse anything you can get your hands on . This is a great way to reuse file folders . With the True Block Technology , you can make a folder look practically new . The labels underneath do n't show through . Of course you can use Avery 's templates with this labels . What could make it any greater ? They can be used on both Inkjet and Laser Printer . How many times have you bought printer labels only to discover they are n't for your printer ? They even come with 2 Box Tops for Education . Got ta love that ! Avery has done it . The perfect label . You are going to find a million uses for these File Folder Labels .	1
These worked very well for me . I was able to load them in my laserjet printer and and print a variety of labels to cover up older existing labels . The labels are thicker than normal and have a grey back to help make sure there is no show through . Over all a great and did the job .	1
Avery has accomplished exactly what they have claimed with their Ink Jet File Folder Labels . That which I am most pleased about with regard to this product is the fact that when one label is placed over another , the old label is entirely blocked out , permitting me to use and reuse my file folders . These labels may pay for themselves over time .	1
Great labels , they cover up everything underneath so if you are like me and reuse your folders , they will work wonderfully ! Highly recommend !	1
*****I am a huge fan of Avery products , especially their new `` TrueBlock Technology '' -- a special process that makes the label completely opaque -- so that you ca n't see through it at all no matter what is under it . No more layering file labels on top of each other to block out old writing underneath ! It is amazing and covers over everything . The labels come on sheets with 30 labels to a sheet . They are heavy duty and have a very slight chemically odor to them.I use these labels not just for file folders but for all kinds of other paperwork to block out dark writing and to cover over things to reuse them . Avery also makes file folder labels that are larger that have colors on them to be used for file folders too . I like these better even though they are just standard size ( they are 2/3 '' by 3 7/16 '' ) because they are all white and thus are more multi-use.The labels come with free templates and software online if you use your labels in your printer , which I do not . They also come with a free sample of 4 Avery NoteTabs . These are like a combination of a Post-It note and a divider -- a heavy duty stick-on removable divider tab . I really like these as well.Even though these are more expensive than labels without `` TrueBlock Technology '' I will still buy them because you use far fewer and they work much better . In the long run they save you both time and money , I think.Highly recommended . *****	1
These are very high quality File Folder labels that can be printed with either an Inkjet or a Laser printer . I printed mine using a Lexmark X3350 Inkjet printer . There were no problems with the label sheet feeding through the printer . The labels hold the ink without smearing or blurring or bleeding . Furthermore , no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer - a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels . Yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it 's time to apply them . Used over an existing label or writing , they are truly opaque . Nothing shows through.About half my files are 1/3 cut Manila folders and the other half are 1/5 cut Pendaflex hanging folders . These labels are intended for the 1/3 cut folders and they work perfectly there . But I found that by restricting the text on the label to about 2 inches total width , I could easily use them on the 1/5 cut hanging folders as well . I just applied the new label to the old paper label insert and then folded over the excess.I recommend that you investigate the `` Design and Print Online '' feature available on Avery 's website . It is far more flexible than a simple template . With it , I was able to create a text field for my labels that was short enough to fit on the 1/5 cut folders . You can select fonts , sizes , colors , styles , even add images to your labels . And you can save your layout for future use . The interface is a little strange and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways , but you 'll easily enough get the hang of it with a bit of experimentation ( and it has an `` Undo '' ) . I printed my first try on plain paper and then overlaid it on the label sheet to double check.The package contains 25 sheets of labels with 30 labels per sheet for a total of 750 labels . Searching Amazon , I find that there is also a 1500 label package but I do n't see anything smaller than the 750 size . This is fine in a business setting , but for home use 750 labels is likely to last more than a lifetime ! I 'd like to see Avery offer a 150 or 180 label version for the home market.These work well and , combined with Avery 's website , will get that old file cabinet orderly and organized very quickly .	1
These are easy to work with , they stick well , and they do n't smear . What more can a person ask for ? I 'd buy them if the price were competitive with what else is out there .	1
We use these to label all of our files because they are really sticky and rarely if ever come off , and the ability to have them delivered to our doorstep with prime at a low price just makes it that much better !	1
These are excellent to cover old file names and reuse the folders again . They have the tru block backing , so nothing shows through the label . These will print well on most printers .	1
While this is a good product I had problems downloading a template to print the labels and had to call Avery customer support . While I found customer support helpful I had to speak to two people because the first technical support agent did not think this product worked in a laser printer and he had to transfer me someone who confirmed it did.I first went to the Avery website and put in my product number which brought up a bunch of information and options . One download would have added an Avery icon to Word and as I understand it a toolbar as well . I did not want this.When I tried to call Avery to figure out how to download a template that did not automatically add a toolbar to my screen the person helping me showed me what to do . I was able to save a template to word that I can use without adding any sort of icon or toolbar . I asked about using the product in my laser printer only to be told it did not work in a laser printer contrary to the packaging . When I questioned this he transferred me to another agent who confirmed it did.One concern for those who do not have massive amounts of file folder labels to print is that you can only put the labels through a printer once . If you do n't use all the labels the first time you have to hand write on the remaining ones.One good thing is that there are instructions on each sheet explaining how to use the labels . While the sheet directs you to the Avery website for more information , it also includes a toll free phone number for the Consumer Service Center and another for Avery Software Support . While it took two people to address my concerns the representatives were very professional.The labels are big enough to cover old labels and there is no problem writing on them . They work fine . I have used a couple of sheets already.Overall this is a good product . I just wish the website was a bit more user friendly but there is customer support to help people like me who have trouble navigating the website .	1
First let me say , these are AWESOME and I am so glad I had the opportunity to try them on a trial basis because I do n't think I would have forked out the almost twenty bucks on something I was n't sure about ... but I would and will gladly fork it out now knowing they work as well as Avery claims , if not better . There are 750 in the package ... but with all the uses that wo n't take long to use up . **QUALITY**Labels are labels , right ? Nope ! These are high quality labels that really do cover up any writing underneath , even if it was written in a broad tip Sharpie . This is accomplished because the labels have a gray backing where the adhesive is rather than just plain white single-layer paper like most labels . They are also a heavier weight paper than your basic labels meaning no tearing ! ! They adhesive is strong enough to stay put , yet releases smoothly if you wanted to remove it ... without leaving behind any torn paper or yucky sticky goo ... YAY for that because I am ALWAYS reusing file folders and renaming them . **PRINTING**I have printed these using Word and [ ... ] version of Word ... both print perfectly and line up perfectly without having to adjust the template 's settings at all ( I usually have to adjust them by 1/8th of an inch or so to line up perfectly ) ... but not with these ! ! I have used them in my inkjet printer without any problems as well as my laser printer . Usually my laser printer causes paper to curl due to the heat , but these do n't do that . I often print only a few lables at a time and reuse the sheet later with some of the labels removed ... .I have had other labels catch and get stuck in the printer when doing this , but not with these ... smooooooooth sailing ! The uses for these are endless ... not just for file folders . I use them to label my kids books & toys , totes that I use for storage items , little jars I store fresh ground spices in , and other personal items ... .they are great for writing on too , not just printing . The packaging Avery sells their labels in works great for storing them because it keeps the labels from bending or getting the corners torn up , yet is super easy to take a new sheet out or put one away for future use ... without taking up a bunch of space . The label is the perfect height for the tabs on hanging file folders , but it a bit too long , so I just fold it over the back and it works perfectly . My filing cabinet now shows my OCD nature and is freakishly neat & organized thanks to Avery ! My only gripe , and this is a rather pathetic one ... I wish they came in colors to match my folders ... I 'd even settle on just plain manila . Then my filing cabinet would be a true work of art ! !	1
I was very impressed with this product , both in how the printing went and how well the `` blocking '' technology works at keeping labels located under this new label are blocked from being seen under it.The labels loaded and printed well - the blacking is substanial enough to keep the print job `` straight '' through without any creep to the left or the right . The resulting labels were printed on track , without coming out cockeyed .	1
The biggest plus for the Avery 8366 File Folder Labels is Avery 's TrueBlock technology which layers a semi-opaque gray layer to the back of the label , allowing it to hide most anything you may put it on top of . I know that for a lot of the labels I have I have to remove anything underneath as they 'll show right through . For this alone the Avery labels are great.Other than that , they 're normal-looking labels that are sized to put on tab-type file folders . Unlike a different style of Avery label I reviewed earlier , Microsoft Word 2010 did not have a template for these . Avery 's web site has several options , including an 88MB program that runs independent of Word . A smaller `` helper '' toolbar for Word does n't support Word 2010 . At the basic level , a .doc file is provided which you can open in Word and fill it in , but this means you ca n't take advantage of automation features such as mail-merge , etc . This is not a fault of the labels themselves , but if you 're going to use these you might want to know.The instructions for the labels say to not reuse the sheet , though it seems to work anyway for at least a few passes .	1
The Avery File Folder Labels are very nice and easy to use . Runs through my printer without any problems , no smudging , jamming or anything . I prefer these particular labels over most other brands for that reason alone .	1
I 've purchased other 'no bleed-through ' labels from office supply stores and found that they fall flat on their claims . When I heard these labels were suppose to stop bleed-through , I bought a pack of folders to go with it , figuring it would n't work as advertised and I 'd end up tossing some old files . I was shocked when they actually covered up the DARK writing underneath . I often use a very thick , black marker for writing on some folders , and these labels did n't allow the original writing to bleed through at all . Very impressive .	1
If you are resusing old file folder these are the absolute best . There is NO bleed through of whatever is written behind it , even if written in dark black sharpie.The labels have some sort of coating on the back that really does block everything out.You can quickly find a template in Word by typing in 8366 in the search box after you do `` File '' `` New '' .When using these templates I always select the whole document and have the edges of the cells of the tables filled in so that I can tell where the edge of the label is while typing ( In Word 2007 this is under the Home tab in the Paragraph section , it looks like a little 4 square box with the bottom underlined ) . Chose `` All borders '' . You can then go back and Chose `` No borders '' when done if you do not want the borders printed .	1
We bought these initially for our daughter 's first birthday party a few years ago , and we were very happy with its ease of use and professional look . Since then , we 've used it on just about every event we send invitations for . In addition , we 've also used these to print labels for just about anything ( plain shoe boxes , photo boxes , labels on back of pictures , gift bags , and fancy name tags for drinking glasses/cups at parties ) .Because it is clear , it can go on any color of envelope ( except the dark ones ) . Labels printed fine on our inkjet printers ( HP Deskjet PSC 750 , Canon Pixma MX870 , Epson Artisan 810 ) in black & white and in color , and the results were excellent . I 've used it on laserjets as well ( HP Color LJ 3550 and HP 2420 ) , and it prints fine . I just let the printed product sit a few minutes , just in case the laserjet ink was still wet ( I 've actually tried to smudge a few labels after printing on a laserjet , and the ink did NOT smudge at all ) . The results were just as good as the deskjet printed set . Word 2003 and 2007 has the proper template for this product . The template for Word XP and Word 2000 can be downloaded from [ ... ] .The labels are easy to peel , thanks to the pop-up edge for easy peeling . Because they are clear , they are virtually invisible when applied to almost any colored surfaces . This gives the finished product a professional look without the professional price.Though we 've gone through many of these over the years , I 've only just got to write a review for this recently . I highly recommend this product .	1
Avery Labels have been a part of my mailings for various events for over two decades . But this is the first time I 've ever used the clear versions and I have to say , this is a darn good product and I 'd probably buy more.The labels do smudge rather easily and this might be difficult to see when the labels are still on the carrier sheet , but you can see the smudges kind of easily after they are stuck down on your envelopes , so a bit of care and clean hands are needed when doing large mailings.The ink from my printer dried pretty quickly on these labels and it seemed more crisp ( with no ink spread ) than others I 've used and they ran through my printer with zero problems.These labels peel fairly easily off the carrier sheet and the transparent label stock looks great on various kinds of envelopes , colors and textures which makes it seem like the label is made of the same material as your surface at first glance.As others here have written you can also use these for handwritten labeling as well as machine labeling and the quantity is enough for most basic mailings or labeling jobs . A great product , but a little pricey for those on a budget .	1
The AVERY CLEAR ADDRESS LABELS 8660 are really easy to use . If you have MS WORD , you can just go to labels , select the # 8660 and start typing away . You can create one label or a whole sheet of labels with the same or different addresses . If you do n't have MS WORD you can go to Avery 's website and download templates for Adobe Photoshop , Illustrator , or InDesign . Do n't have any of those programs , no problem because you can download -- for free -- Avery 's `` Designer Pro '' for either Mac or PC and you can design in that program.Since the labels are clear , the typeface will stand out from the background color of the envelope and looks really elegant even if you 're using white colored envelopes.They 're easy to peel off and stick securely , and if you have an odd sized or shaped envelope , you do n't have to fight with the printer to accept it and risk ruining as it goes through the feeder . You just print on the label and then fix it to the envelope.Avery also has pre-designed templates that feature clip art on the labels that you can download , also for free , so you can make personalized invitations or holiday cards etc.I highly recommend AVERY LABELS 8660 for ease of use and professional looking quality .	1
If you need a label where you do n't want the background to show , then then these lables are for you . Believe it or not , I use these labels for my home brew beer bottles . With a clear label I can make a custom made label on my carefully crafted home brew that makes me look like a brewing professional . No more white background on my beer bottles . No sir - now my beer bottles look professional . Kidding aside I love these clear labels and recommend them to those who wish to hide the background .	1
Use a template to easily print clear address labels . These may smear if you touch them while they 're wet , but that 's true of paper labels , too , so it pays to be careful after they 're done . Very handy , attractive labels .	1
I love these clear labels ; you ca n't even see them when they are affixed to an envelope or to anything else . And they are for ink jet printers ; therefore , I can run these through my printers , and instantly have address labels , or labels for boxes , or for whatever I need/want them for.These labels are awesome , and they make life so much easier.And , these labels are wonderful for cosmetic reasons . They are clear .	1
These labels were easy to use . They printed out with no problems . I would purchase these when next in need of address labels .	1
I like that fact that these are clear . When putting on a colored envelope they look super .	1
These labels are excellent -- 100 % clear.PROS : -- Sticky but easily removable -- Labels are lightweight and thin -- Labels look sleek/high qualityCONS : -- Labels are a bit delicate -- Price is highIf you are in need of clear labels , these are a great option !	1
Being from Avery , these worked perfectly in Word 's built-in template for the Avery 5160 label . Alignment was consistent throughout the whole page.These labels should not really be labeled clear , though . They are more of a matte transparent material , similar to tissue paper . When placed on white envelopes , etc. , they do disappear -- sort of like Scotch Magic tape . If you were expecting some kind of clear plastic , though , these are n't it.The Easy Peel is a great feature to just remove a label or two without crinkling up the whole page which you know will lead to paper jams and/or smudges if you need to run it through the printer again . It is also easy and a time-saver . This is an excellent feature.Also , I ran a few labels twice through my Epson ink jet printer . The ink appears to dry like on paper , and there was no smudging even when I tried with my finger . I would also rank the adhesive above average stick.My only reason for 4 stars is that it is not really clear . It is a matte light white transparent . Depending on what you put it on ( color/finish ) , you may get a different appearance .	1
There are no Avery templates for iPages , so if you have a Mac your out of luck unless you use MS Office.Seriously , does anybody really print out labels and stick them to envelopes anymore ? Do n't all printers take envelopes these days ? I guess if you need to print labels these are a lot better than white labels . They stick well .	1
I wanted these labels for an alternate use . I am getting married in October , and I thought rather than just tying a ribbon around them , I would make personalized labels for them . I figured address labels would be a good size , and when I saw the clear ones , I thought they look better than the solid white ones.I thought wrong . These did not work for my purpose AT ALL . The clear showed air pockets on the bubble containers , and ( even after letting the labels dry overnight ) when I tried to smooth them out , there was some smudging . Even the slightest bit of moisture smears the labels , which is n't really a good idea for something that is going to hold bubbles . ( See my customer images . ) However , much like that guy my Grandmother set me up with when I was in college , this stuff is great on paper . I guess I ca n't fault it for not working on an item that is not its intended use.Luckily , I also ordered theAvery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Inch Clear Address Labels , and those worked perfectly .	1
What 's good and new:1 ) These labels are as close to being completely invisible as possible in a label . They are matte-satin finished and print out beautifully on both inkjet and laser printers . The copier and writing in ballpoint pen works well too.2 ) Avery Label templates are already in many common off-the-shelf word processing softwares . If your company has its own specialized word processor , the Avery template can be downloaded from their website and easily adapted to run on it . Label measurements are also easily found if a new template needs to be created from scratch.3 ) The templates are easy to use and understand.4 ) The instructions in the package itself are clear and easy to understand and markings help the correct insertion of the label page into the printer/copier.5 ) Ink dries quickly.and the best new feature ? 6 ) The easy tear feature which allows a ) half-sheet printing and b ) easy label removal from the sheet . As warmth from a printer or copier heat up the glue on the labels , a sheet can only be run a certain number of times before there are runner marks on the label and the adhesive starts to denature from heat , affecting stickiness and colour ( yellowing ) . Half-sheet printing enables maximum use of the labels as well as making them easier to peel off the sheet .	1
I 've been using Avery labels for years , primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE , it saves a lot of time . Avery 's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use . I use Microsoft Word to print labels . Word has templates for labels , so once you find 8660 , enter your text and hit print . The clear address label does go on completely clear , which would especially be useful when using high quality paper , such as sending out wedding invitations .	1
These labels work well with my 5 year old HP inkjet printer and dry time is fast . The clear labels allow you to use non-white envelopes with a very professional look . ( offwhite )	1
Super easy to use ! Easy to print , easy to peel off and use ! The ink does n't wipe off easily which is a huge perk !	1
I used these labels to make address labels for my save the dates . They were easy to use in the printer and align . They look great : crisp and clear . And they do not appear to smudge easily . And the easy peel feature makes adhereing them quite easy . All in all , a great product for mailings .	1
I love these clear labels- Avery is always top-notch . Printing on them is easy- Avery 's site provides four ways that you can design and print the labels . I used the `` Avery Design and Print Online '' - no downloads required . You can also download the templates to use in Word or on other programs . Anyway , Avery online has lots of designs and it 's simple to use , so all I had to do was type in my address and print the labels . They dry right away and the print did not smear at all . Highly recommended product !	1
Overall , I 'm very satisfied with these . I originally had thought I 'd use them for individual labeling of mail , however , my software does n't allow for single print of labels . So , I initially wasted an entire sheet when the address printed on all the labels.So , I 've gone to using them for my return labels . I use a Canon M83 color printer and they come out just fine . I will say that `` virtually disappear '' is a pretty big stretch ... to me the labels are still very visible even though they are clear .	1
Every once in a while , I try the store-brand and usually they are fine . ( I still have some from Biz-Mart ... anybody remember them ? ! ) But these seem to a ) hold the printing better , b ) peel easier , c ) jam a lot less.Very glad to get them !	1
I love the convenience of the Avery Easy Peel labels . Works perfectly with my printer to create the address labels I need and the clear labels lend a nice look to the label . Highly recommend !	1
I just finished using the Avery Easy Peel clear address labels for my daughter 's birthday invitations . Not only were they easy to print , the labels can be removed easily . When on the envelope they practically disappear ; they are truly clear . I highly recommend this product for anyone using address labels but want it to look like the type is right on the envelope . They are perfect !	1
The Avery easy peel labels are a great way to print out formal invitations . The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost . The software download allows you to easily print full sheets of labels from Microsoft Office products with a variety of fonts for a unique formal appearance . In the past one of the big flaws with these labels was the difficulty of trying to peel them off of the sheet ( especially when you have dozens of labels to peel ! ) . These new labels have an `` easy peel '' design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet . Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations . *** Positive Points : ***- Great results from a variety of inkjet printers ( I used an Epson Artrisan 810 and HP inkjet printer ) - New easy peel design really does work- Looks great on formal invitations or letters*** Negative Points : ***- None	1
Avery labels have n't let me down for all the years I 've been using them . Besides the obvious return labels , I 've used them for labelling water pipes in the basement , birthday party gift bags , folders . They stick well , print well , and are templates for various printing softwares ( I 've been a PrintShop user for a very long time , occasionally use Microsoft Word , and use Avery DesignPro5 ) . DH redid the pipes in the basement 10 years ago and figured it would be best to label them right off the bat , direction , hot or cold , where to , so I did some up in PrintShop . They have n't fallen off , they have n't faded . We also have a hub of cable wires that needed labelling , and Avery did that job as well . Many uses for me , besides the obvious .	1
The labels are semi-transparent white on the sheet , but clear once adhered to the surface . The dilemma I always have with these types of labels is that I just want to print one or a small handful , but the sheet has 30 and I do n't want to waste the rest . One reviewer had a good suggestion to tape a piece of paper over the labels that you do n't want to use up . I find that sometimes if I do n't do this carefully it will jam the printer . So another trick that I discovered is:1 . Make a layout in the software for a small number of labels.2 . Print onto a blank sheet of paper.3 . Put the Avery labels over the printed test sheet , hold up to a strong light source , and see how it lines up.4 . Make adjustments in the software for the alignment , repeat steps 2-4.5 . Print to the Avery sheet .	1
I use these labels to do marketing campaigns for my small landscaping business , and I was so impressed with how crisp and clean they look . The clear color of the labels is great for `` natural '' envelopes that have those little threads in them , or colored envelopes or postcards , so you get an attractive look.Some clear labels look kind of yellowed to me , but these do n't . They are as clear as I expect a sticky label can be . I am really not seeing any color to the label itself , though I am not sure I 'd bother using a clear label on a bright white surface because if you had a piece of dust or something get stuck to a clear label it would n't look cute.These labels did n't smudge , and have an attractive matte surface that took ink well.The only stickers on the sheet are the labels themselves , so they are super easy to peel off , and you are n't left with any stupid little bits sticking to your fingers once you 're nearly done using the sheet of labels . I really love that new design.The labels also went through my printer with no issue . I was worried that because they 've eliminated that outer quarter inch of excess label and just left the labels themselves on the sheet , that the sheets might get stuck in my printer or not feed as well . To test how they fed , I loaded in a stack of labels instead of feeding them one at a time as I used to . I need n't have worried , my printer took up each sheet with no difficulty and no jamming and printed out beautiful address labels.I 'm very happy with the quality here . They 've really managed to eliminate everything I find annoying about printer labels . Everything about these is perfect .	1
These labels are made to be used on your printer with the Avery Template , and the results are spectacular ! However , we find LOTS of other uses for them ! I use black marker on the labels ( labels do not mar , and easily peel off ) to put on our kids dresser drawers so they can not say they `` do n't know where it goes '' when its time to pick up/clean up ! ( NEXT , we need to work on neatness INSIDE the drawers ! ) I also use them on canning jars and they stick great , were easy to read , and , again , they came off neatly ( no GOO Gone needed ! ) One of my favorite uses is for items put in the fridge , or freezer ! I NEVER remember WHAT that stuff IS in there , or WHEN it got put in there ! And someone around here ( everyone takes credit ) thought of using them to put instructions on the laundry ( `` Medium Starch '' ) and the dry cleaning ( `` firm creases '' ) so no more EXCUSES - ANYONE can stop at the cleaners ! These VERSATILE , economical labels are a real find !	1
Yes , gives a crisp , tight look to things like wedding invitations ... will STICK OUT from the rest of the average person 's junk mail .	1
These clear 1x2-5/8 labels are perfect for doing formal invitations - weddings , reunions , aniversaries , etc - any application where you have a premade invitation and an address database where the outer envelope is colored and would look like junk mail with a white mailing label attached.The clear label allows the post office to scan the address reliably ( provided its not a halloween party invite with black envelopes - zero contrast there ! ) and does not detract from the looks of the printed , often formal , invitations.Additionally they can be used for everyday use on business envelopes . As usual , Avery provides templates for all of their products.The last use that we have for this label is making wire markers out of them - you print only on the right side , and rotate to print vertically the wire number . The label is then wrapped around the wire and around itself with the printing being the last layer . When dealing with complex designs on paper , this makes for a very supportable product since every termination is professionally labeled and matches the design schematics .	1
Seems we never have enough labels around here , between sending out invitations to one party or another or my new writer sending cards to family ( I like to print out sheets of addresses she can easily put on an envelope by herself whens he has a letter ready to mail since she 's only 6 and sometimes her writing can be a bit hard to read this way she can put one on and an envelope with a stamp and put it in the mail box herself , this has greatly increased her reading and writing by being penpals with all our out of state relatives ) . My daughter also loves to make her own stickers , when she was smaller the white labels worked fine but now that she 's older she does n't want everything to have a white rectangle around it and these clear labels are perfect , she can use colorful gel pens and draw her little images and then when she puts her `` sticker '' on something only her drawing shows ! They print wonderfully in my canon printer and line up just perfectly . Great purchase !	1
These labels are perfect for any or multi-colored designs you want for identification , addressing or application add-ons.Easy to use , just great and clear backing is good for any solid color page application . They are my favorite for multipurpose uses .	1
The look of these labels is great , however they do not adhere very well . They tend to peel up on their own when used on bubble envelopes . They print well in laser printer . I would not buy these again due to worry over the labels falling off during shipping .	1
I received these labels and the first thing I did was print out a page of address labels with my own information on them to test the quality . The printer was able to feed the label paper through the printer with no issues . Printing in economy was n't the best idea as it was faint . I reprinted the labels using standard ink quality and everything came out perfect . Text was centered on the labels as it should be , no jams , no label 's peeling off in the printer . These work well.I actually used another version of this label a few years back on my wedding invitations to create custom return address labels and saved a ton of money over ordering custom labels from some company . These labels match the quality and I could easily recommend using these for anything from mailing bills to mailing wedding invitations , they do a great job and the quality of the label is really good .	1
The Avery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Inch Clear Address Label 750 Count ( 8660 ) are fabulous labels which have given me no problems . I 've written on some with a Sharpie for quick labeling ( save those extras if you do n't print all on a sheet ) and printed in both color and black with no smudging . Love my Canon printers with genuine Canon ink . The Avery website offers great designing hints and templates , particularly for those of us who use a Mac . Microsoft Office also contains templates , but I really enjoy using Design Pro from the website . These clear labels are really and truly clear when applied , and they are extremely easy to remove from the sheet . I 'll warn you , though , be careful if you are applying in a less than clean environment , as dust , dirt and animal hairs can be pressed onto your otherwise pristine document , destroying your otherwise favorable impression . No need to have labels professionally printed with this product , you can do it yourself if you have the time .	1
Just tried out these labels on a mailing that I did . They work as advertised producing a clear , clean label that is easy to place and read . You ca n't go wrong with Avery labels .	1
For the past five years Avery 's clear address labels have been my preferred label for all my address label needs . I like them because they 're clear and can be put on any color envelope and not stick out like a sore thumb . Printing on these labels is a snap . I 've never had any issues with them not printing nicely or getting stuck in the printer . The new easy peel feature is a nice addition . By simply bending back a column of the sheet you can easily access the edge of all the labels in the column for easy peeling and application.These labels can be used for more than just mailing . We 've used them to label plastic containers and school projects .	1
These labels worked out very well . We used them for address and return address labels . I tried both color and black writing . They came out of the printer clear and did not smudge . They stick easily and are nice and clear , making them appropriate for any color envelope . Easy to peel off of the backing . I would reccomend these labels for any label uses .	1
I would give these a 4.5 rating if I could . The lost half point is because I too often think that I printed out my labels wrong because of the little extra bit provided to make the peel off easier . This part stays behind on the sheet . Unless I look real close , I ca n't tell if I printed the labels right or not . If I used these all the time , I 'm sure this would stop being an issue , as I would adjust to it.Aside from the little side thing , these labels are great ! Easy to use , look amazing & professional thanks to being clear . They stick really good . They do exactly what they are supposed to do.Recommended !	1
If you 're doing a lot of labeling , this product makes it a lot easier to get the labels started . Not much more expensive than the originals , and I think it 's worth the extra couple bucks for the convenience . Printing comes out fine on the paper , as well , and being clear , they should work really nicely with colored envelopes at Christmas .	1
Great labels . They are a ease to load . Print well and they stick even better . The clear background gives your work the look of professionalism . The price point is right . All around perfect addition to any office .	1
I love using clear labels on things I like to look really nice . We used these on graduation invitations . I really like Avery labels , as I 've never had a problem setting them up to print properly . The print comes out where it should on the label and they look very nice - especially when you ca n't see them - like with these clear labels .	1
A lot of clear labels still have problems with ink jet printers , jamming and smudges for example . But these labels presented none of those challenges . I 'm especially pleased with the lack of smudging ! Back in the day ... my Dad used to use one of those old Dyno labelmakers to label all of his tools etc . And I thought that was cute , but a little strange . I guess that my grandkids will start feeling the same way about how I 'm now labelling stuff with these . ; - )	1
I use several types of labels when mailing , shipping or just labeling items . These I use for printing out mailing labels , labeling household items and as easy to write on folder labels . They leave a neater appearance than colored labels . I do n't find that I crinkle the remaining labels on the page like others have commented on . They have a nice look and the ink does not smudge when I put the printed labels on anything . The labels do the job that they were intended to do . They are also good for using to tape things that might require a stronger connection than regular tape can give and they release easier than tape because of their thickness .	1
I think these labels are a very good all purpose label , not just for an inkjet printer , as you can use these by hand too.Not only to label file folders , or to label cd cases , but I would also use these for just about anything I want to label , like when I buy something in bulk and freeze it . I always like to label what the item is , as well as when I froze it.These labels look white , but when you peel them off they are clear . You can use either a pen or marker on them.The label size is ample , so you can write what you need to on it . I have some labels just like this , but they are white . I think I prefer these clear labels.I did find them alittle hard to see where one label ends , and another one begins . I like that they come in a pack of 750 . I doubt I will have to buy anymore of this size label in my lifetime.Iam very happy with these labels .	1
I 've used these to print a few sheets of return-address labels , and I really like them.Ease of peel : Almost perfect . They do come off easily , but not so easily I can bend the paper back and get 10 off at once . For single-label removing it 's great . Tearing off the side leaves a tiny bit of each label free , enough for you to grab so you do n't have to scrape off every label.Look : I love how they are translucent . The ink stands out nice and sharp , and the address seems more clear . It looks professional and pretty.Printing : ( HP LaserJet ) No problems . I was surprised at how crisp the ink was , and how there was no smudging right after it came off the printer . ( I 'm used to getting ink on my fingers . ) Also , using the 'Mailing Labels ' 'US Letter Small ' presets printing from Address Book ( on a Mac ) the labels were all printed right ( makes my life easier ) .Price : There are labels you can get for half the price . If you do a lot of printing these may not be economical . But if it 's for rather infrequent use , I favor the performance and look of these labels over saving a few dollars.I recommend giving them a try .	1
I often buy colored envelopes because I think they look so nice when you get them in a stack of mostly white mail . But if you want to use labels , the white rectangles look so ugly . These are perfect ! I find they do n't stick quite as well as the white ones , but never had one come off and get returned.They do n't really help with dark colored paper ( including most reds ) because the black ink does n't stand out enough ) , but for pastels or off whites , they are beautiful .	1
She said : The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful . The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem , so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers . You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise , the `` Easy Peel '' . Peel one label off a sheet , and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition .	1
This is the second type of `` Easy Peel '' label I 've tried from Avery . I 'm now officially a fan . The sheet of labels has three pre-scored `` lines '' where it folds . Print your labels , fold along one of the lines , and the edges of ten of the labels are quickly exposed to make peeling super easy . This might not make a difference if you are only printing a few labels , but it could be a nice time saver if you are doing a mass mailing . It was particularly nice with these very thin clear labels.One other side note ... These labels are for inkjet printers . Be sure to get the type of labels that are designed for your printer ( inkjet labels for inkjet printers , laser labels for laser printers ) . In the past , I have made the mistake of using the wrong type of labels in a printer , and I believe that it caused some damage . Do n't make that mistake . These Avery INKJET labels worked just great in my older HP 7760 inkjet printer .	1
So ... my sister decided that she did n't want to hand address 200+ wedding invitations . There clear labels worked well for the invitations and did n't look at office like . They printed without jamming in both the manual and auto feed trays of my Canon inkjet printer . The ink also did n't smear when you touched it immediately after printing , however it will smear if it gets wet but is still legible . The easy peel feature was nice , but then again I 've never had an issue peeling address labels off a sheet before , and I usually fold the normal sheets along the edge just like you are instructed to do with the easy peel sheets .	1
You know the feeling ... after you get used to using a product for a long time ... the manufacturer either discontinues it or takes a few shortcuts to cut costs and it just does n't work like it used to ? ? I get that feeling a lot . BUT , not with Avery products . It is one brand that I feel I can trust to deliver a quality product time after time.The clear labels were no exception . They work great and look good .	1
Our town 's energy committee recently had a project for which we needed about 250 peel-off labels . Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL ( compact fluorescent ) light bulbs free at our town 's community day ( sort of like a street fair ) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use . CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs . For the 250 bulbs , we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $ 0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $ 15,000 . There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labels were a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee 's name . The question was how to get the information printed on the labels . At the Avery web site , I found free software , DesignPro , which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes . I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor the labels , there were about a dozen pre-made templates for the different size labels . I chose the template that matched my labels . Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint . I was able to cut and paste a graphics image , add the appropriate text , and choose a font for the text . A test run on my printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels . The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up . I can never remember . After an up/down test , I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success . Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours . We were able to peel the labels from the printed sheets easily . There was enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs . One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways . The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before . I am now a big fan of Avery labels , but I recommend getting the free software to make them work .	1
I received this product through the Amazon Vine program . As with all Avery Products , an easy to use template is available on their website for using their products . Since I use Office Products , I used the Word template.I found the template to be easy to use and was able to export my mailing list so that I could print my labels with no issue . The nice part about these labels is that they essentially disappear onto the envelope that you are using so only the printing really shows up . This makes it look as if you had inserted the envelope into a typewritter ( anyone out there besides me remember those ? ) and printed out the address.The only caution I have has to do with inkjet printers in general and that is to be careful about getting your label wet as the print will run . My early solution to this problem was to put a piece of clear shipping tape over the label . My current method of dealing with this is to use a Kodak Printer as their ink will not run or smear when it gets wet.I gave this product a 4 star instead of 5 star as I still find the labels difficult to remove from the sheet if you only print one or two labels . While bending the page works to release a label , it also generally loosens the adjoining label . Also , you need to be careful how far you bend the sheet if you are planning to re-insert the sheet to print more labels out at a later date.I would definately recommend these labels if you are looking for a professional looking address label .	1
These clear , matte finish labels from Avery work great in my HP 1610 inkjet printer . Text comes out crisp and clear . I do recommend letting them dry for a while before handling them , as with anything else you print . These are not crystal clear , nor are they glossy , but they are clear enough that if you 're putting them on a colored envelope , the color will show through . I like the matte finish because it makes the label blend in with the paper , almost to the point that it looks like the text is printed directly on the paper.I downloaded the template from Avery 's web site . It 's in Microsoft Word format but it works flawlessly with OpenOffice .	1
These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects , particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory . You can affix them to a bare wood surface , making sure to burnish the labelssecurely , then apply clear finish on top . I 've found that they work very well for ( of allthings ) custom guitar work . It 's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design , and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal . I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes . The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly , as the ink will rub off . Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing . I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool , but you could improvise to see what works best for you . Of course , this is only one idea , but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy .	1
This label is specified to ink-jets , but they work just fine on laser print too . Consistent die-cut quality keeps the sheet integrity together for multiple printer passes .	1
The following is my fianc & eacute ; e 's review of the labels.My fianc & eacute ; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding . We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels . It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels . When they printed out , they looked really good . There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center . I 'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer . I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay . About three out of 100 labels were messed up . I recommend these labels . I 'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates . When I put them on the postcards , they looked really good = )	1
I always requested Avery labels at the office - they are extremely easy to print and apply . I recently used these for a huge batch of cards and LOVE them . We ordered ivory envelopes so we needed clear labels and these were perfect ! They are easy to print and the `` easy peel '' feature really makes applying them go much more quickly . I 'll definitely use these again for our holiday cards !	1
The Avery Easy Peel labels are really easy to work with . My inkjet ink does n't smudge and the labels are super easy to peel . I highly recommend them .	1
I have had negative experiences with `` generic '' printable labels in the past ... specifically , with the sheet getting stuck in my ink jet printer . I have had no problems at all with these Avery labels . They go through the printer smoothly . The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well . I have also used these same labels in the white version , which work equally well . However , for purely aesthetic reasons , I prefer the clear labels.If you go online to the Avery website , there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking .	1
This size of address label has many uses . Of course , they can be used for addresses on packages and envelopes , but also as identification labels . I printed a sheet with my name , address and phone number to attach to things I take on vacation . The print on my inkjet printer was clean and crisp , the ink dried quickly ( no smudging ) , the labels indeed do peel easily and I like the translucent background that works with many surfaces . Word 2010 had the format in its list of labels and each label was perfectly aligned . You can also download free templates from Avery 's web site .	1
The main reason I like these labels : 1 . Easy to use with my software programs . 2 . Print out perfect ! 3 . Was able to put a clip art on them . 4 . Last reason but the best of all . They peel off so very easy . I have to add that the Avery Labels have found so many uses from address labels , for file folders , recipe headings , journaling , labeling totes and I 'm sure I will find other places to use them . I have n't found anything negative about these labels and usually I do n't like using them because they are hard to peel off .	1
These print very crisply on my laser ( I realize this is supposed to be for inkjet ) . The claim that these are invisible is not true ... You can see it.. and on white paper , it looks like a white label . But I think it would be impossible for it to be invisible as claimed . Otherwise , it is excellent . High quality	1
I use this size label not only for addressees , but also to print my own return address labels . Being a pen pal , I 've seen plenty of professionally-printed clear address labels . On those , the ink sits on top of glossy , clear `` paper '' and scuffs right off during shipping . Those address labels are almost always illegible by the time they get to me . And what 's the point of an address label if the address chips right off ? These labels are different , though , because they 're textured and have more of a matte finish . While they are n't completely `` invisible '' and can still be seen when put on an envelope , they give a nice , professional look that white labels do n't necessarily give . It also is surprising that an InkJet printer has the ability to do this type of printing and not smear off . ( Note : These are n't colorfast , however . If they get wet , the ink can smear off . ) As a handy feature for removal , the backing paper can be bent , exposing just one narrow edge on the right side of each label.The only real problem I have is that my printer is n't always reliable in `` seizing '' this type of paper , sometimes ending up in a wasted sheet . That 's more of a potential issue with certain printers , though .	1
Avery always makes great labels and gives you the best templates and software to go with them , so it 's no surprise that I 'm very pleased with their clear easy-peel address labels . The healthy 1 '' x 2 5/8 '' size allows for plenty of font choices.I use tan parchment-colored envelopes for my business and slapping a white label on them gives a second-class mail look . The clear labels impart a more professional appearance , and while I do n't know it to be a fact , I think recipients are far more likely to pay attention.Finally , the easy peel feature prevents both frustration and inappropriate words in the office . Highly recommended .	1
Avery labels ( the white paper ones ) have been a staple at my desk and in my kitchen for years . I use them multiple ways : there 's always the address label for the few snail mail pieces I still send , then there are file folders for the actual paperwork I still file manually , instead of digitally , but it 's the other stuff where I really put these to use - they 're perfect for labeling Mason jars after you 've processed that summer harvest of peaches and figs , I 've used them to label bakery boxes of cookies I 've baked and taken to meetings ( I have a set pre-printed with the names and ingredients of various cookie recipes I bake frequently ) , they 're a snap to slap on a jar or Tupperware container filled with arborio rice you 'd like to distinguish from the basmati in the container next to it on the shelf and they make figuring out which computer cable goes to which peripheral a snap.These clear labels are even better than the white ones . They 're advertised as clear - do n't expect shiny-clear , like a piece of cellophane tape . Instead , they 've got somewhat of a mildly-milky matte finish , like Scotch brand Magic Tape , that does n't exactly disappear when applied to surfaces . That 's hardly a negative , however , as they stick much better than the white ones - I 'll be using these from now on for Mason jars and other goodies in the pantry . These also seem sturdier ... I expect they 'll stand up to wear better than the white paper-based labels.Finally , Avery has done a nifty little improvement to the base papers these labels are mounted on : just a small bend in the paper causes the edge of the label to pop up and makes removing them a snap ! You can easily extract a single label without bothering any of the others.Against truly dark items ( do you really mail things in black envelopes all that often ? ) with dark printing on the label may be the only time you 'll need to use a paper-based label instead ; the contrast in that situation may simply not be enough to read the label easily.With that one exception , I expect I 'll be using these labels often and to good effect . Recommended .	1
Avery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Clear label gives any envelope a professional look . It is of the standard address size , but can be used to label items such as dvds , boxes , etc . I prefer the clear labels to others , as they give a neat effect on birthday card envelopes . I actually use the clear shipping ones for this purpose . My word processsor , which is Word Perfect , includes a template for this label . Avery makes quality labels , and you ca n't go wrong with these .	1
I like these clear labels . They print up easily and look great on all envelopes . I am currently using them for business , but they would work well for personal items as well . Especially invitations as they would make it elegant being that they are clear . Easy to use , print is clear and dark .	1
I LOVE these labels . The surface is a sort of matte texture , making them almost disappear when placed on an envelope . Printing on an inkjet printer yields sharp and smearless results . They look a lot classier on an envelope than the standard white mailing labels.These are useful not only for mailing , but for labeling almost anything . I will still use my label maker for stuff that gets a lot of abuse or get wet ( like soccer balls and drink cups ) but these are much more discrete for labeling other possessions.I keep a three ring binder filled with printed address labels stored in slash pocket folders with tabs ( labeled with a sample label ) for the addresses I use frequently . However , when sending something nice like a birthday card I was never pleased with the way the white labelss looked . These solve my problem . I printed up a sheet for all my favorite addresses and stuck them in my binder for use on more formal mail . I also printed up a sheet with `` Fragile , do not bend '' for when I mail photos . Since they are clear it is easier to find a spot to put them without covering up addresses.I have avoided clear labels in the past due to problems with them jamming the printer , clumping up when you try to peel them and generally being difficult to work with in every way . These labels are much , much better than the previous clear labels and simply work .	1
We bought these to use on our save-the-date cards and wedding invitations , and they worked out great . Just the right size for regular envelopes , and the look was exactly what we were going for.One suggestion - if you 're not using the whole page of labels , and want to use the remaining labels later , take a piece of white paper , and tape it over the labels you are not using . The labels get darker every time you run them through the printer . It 's hard to notice on the page , but once you affix them to the envelope , they can look a bit dirty .	1
I found these easy to use with my HP printer . They dried pretty much instantly and I had no problems with smudging at all . Once printed , the labels are simple to remove and did not tear . These are a must have if you 're wanting to put labels on colored envelopes or otherwise want a nicer finish than a colored or more visible label . These work great !	1
I 've used Avery labels for years including the laser version of 8660 until recently when my laser all-in-one bit the dust . I was pleased to have this product come up in the Vine Newsletter since I replaced my laser with an Epson 810 inkjet all in one . I also just ran out of pre-printed labels of all sorts ( including the freebees and the donate bait ) .The 8660 is a standard label in MS Word and Open Office , and that glable in UBUNTU supported them as well . Software - no sweat ( besides they have free stuff on the web ) and I had plenty of options ( besides I 'd already set up the laser version ) I slipped a sheet of these in the Epson and fired off a page of return address labels . They worked like a charm , positioned themselves properly , type was crisp and clean and dried quickly . The easy peel worked as advertised and the labels looked great on the day 's outgoing mail of all types.I 've since run some special labels with color print and graphics and was impressed by the output . No glitches with multiple sheets either.They do the job and they do it right . Ca n't ask for more than that .	1
This is an excellent quality paper , I used it to create photo Christmas cards , and special gift photos . It does a good job !	1
I used these to print signs , and they worked well . On the back of the paper , it does say EPSON in small letters . Overall , this was a good product .	1
Believe me paper matters . When you put the wrong paper in your printer , you get very weird results.P.S . This review was before I had used Kodak 's One Touch to better Pictures . Please see my Kodak Paper review prior to making your buying decision . I was really impressed with what Kodak did.REVIEW IS BASED ON USE ON THE EPSON 890 : When I bought my Epson 890 , I bought several different packs of Epson paper , this 8 X 10 one , an 8.5 X 11 one and some 4 X 6 sheets as well as the roll paper . See my separate reviews on the others items ( including the printer ) also on this site , if you are interested in them . However , finally , I got around to trying the 8 x 10 paper . You see you wait until you have the perfect picture to do an enlargement.NICE QUALITY IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT USESIt did not dissappoint . Wow , the colors were great . I took several types of pictures and different lighting and the result were great . Now that I 've tried it I 'm hooked . People who have seen the pictures first of all ca n't believe they are off an inkjet printer . Then they marvel at the color and sharpness of the photo.PAPER AND PRINTER INTERATION : One caution , those of you that think you can use any paper on any printer ... Forget it . I had some paper from another supplier and when I used it on the Epson , the ghostly images were terrible . It seems not surprisingly that the printers are optimized for their papers . And to be honest , it is not worth the money to me to try a bunch of other manufacturer 's paper only to find out the results would be bad.EASIER TO FIND ON THE WEB THAN IN THE STORES : This paper is easier to find on the net . I have looked in my usual spots for this paper off the web and considering not only computer , office supply and grocery stores it is just not out there.Great product ... Enjoy .	1
I bought this to print 4x6 's in my pixma . These are really nice quality for the price . I found them to be just as nice as higher end 4x6 paper . It prints great on an inkjet . I recommend this product . Any questions please ask i am always looking for advice so i enjoy giving it when i can as well .	1
Nice product , produces very good pics.Nice heavy paper thats works well in my Canon printer.Should last a long time ! ! ! Great	1
The Epson High-Gloss Premium Photo Paper is very high quality inkjet paper that produces fantastic looking , smudge resistant prints from myEpson Stylus Photo 2200 Inkjet Printer.This paper is very quick drying so prints can be stacked without worrying that they will stick together . I also like that it is fairly heavy stock so prints have the feel of professional lab quality.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
I knew this was a good price and the quality of the paper was excellent . I ordered it because I had previously ordered the Epson printer . Product was received within a few days .	1
We 've been using HP inkjet printers for years and we have a pretty good stash of 4x6 photo paper that we had planned to use with our new Epson Artisan 710 printer . Unfortunately , when we printed our first 4x6 photo we knew immediately that something was wrong since the colors were extremely blotchy and it took the ink several minutes to dry.I tried changing every printer and quality setting I could find , then it occurred to me that the problem might be the HP paper . I was skeptical , but I figured I would buy a pack of this paper just to test the theory since it is fairly inexpensive.Anyway , I know it sounds crazy , but this paper completely solved the problem and we 're getting beautiful prints from our new Epson Artisan 710 printer ! If you 're planning on using HP photo paper with an Epson printer ; take my advice and give it away instead - then buy some of this Epson paper for awesome results ! As far as the quality of the paper goes , it feels just like the paper used by professional labs . It also has the right level of gloss to print photos that are sharp and colorful.I highly recommend this paper for use with Epson printers .	1
Recently I got a newEpson XP-410 Printerand was extremely dissatisfied with the quality of the photo prints . After complaining about it to a friend , he told me to try using Epson 's own photo paper ( I had used HP paper before ) . Sure enough , the quality of prints improved dramatically . Since my Epson printer is WiFi AND AirPort compatible , I 'd much rather use it than my old HP printer . Which means that from now on I 'll be shopping for Epson photo paper as well , and my stockpile of old HP paper has become useless . I may still hang on to it just in case I switch back to an HP printer at some point in the future.The paper itself is very nice . The prints are smooth and glossy , as advertised . They are on par with the prints you 'll get from the numerous online photo printing sites , but the exact outcome may depend on the quality of the printer you have , as well as on the ink . I am also not sure how durable these prints are , but since I still have many digital photos gracing the walls of my house that are over a decade old , I am pretty confident that this paper will endure for a foreseeable future .	1
This photo paper was quite cheap price wise but works great in my Lexmark , HP , and Epson printers with no problem at all . The quality is decent enough for me and at this price it 's super cheap . Performs well , seems to work in a variety of printers , and very inexpensive , I would recommend this for the casual user wanting a few frame picture of the kids etc .	1
We have an Epson R1900 Photo printer . We use Epson photo paper in it exclusively . This paper is high quality and produces very true colors and sharpness . When we buy it at Amazon it is less expensive than when on sale at Epson .	1
I usually used Kodak paper , but I ordered this largely on comments about it being instant dry and very durable . Both comments are true . This stuff is ready to use as soon as it comes out of the printer and it can handle small mounts of moisture for several seconds without running or smudging . I 'll never use Kodak again .	1
I bought this photo paper when I was in search of some more photo paper to print out my pictures at home and after looking around I came upon this photo paper from Epson . I had actually recently bought an Epson Workforce 845 , so I decide to try the Epson paper as well . In simple words , this is very high quality paper that I would recommend for your 4x6 printing at home . It obviously is n't going to be the & # 34 ; best & # 34 ; , but for the price you definitely ca n't go wrong . I will be purchasing more of this photo paper in the future as it nice photo paper .	1
This brand of photo paper is truly premium . I print a lot of photos . This is one of the best quality photo papers I 've come across . The photos come out looking like you just picked them up from a photo printing store .	1
I started using this paper in 2005 , and I 'm still using it . I occasionally print sizes up to 8 '' x10 '' , but about 90 % of my color photo printing is on the 4 '' x6 '' paper . I 've probably used close to a thousand sheets , and the paper quality has been consistently excellent . I 'm currently using the paper with an Epson XP-850 printer . I 've tried using other brands , but forget it , they never give the rich , vivid color prints that the Epson paper gives .	1
We bought a dedicated photo printer for our preschool . Epson XP-600 . It was smallish and held photo paper in its trays . It took us a while to dial in on the right paper for the Airprint from our iOS devices . This Premium paper did the trick . Ultra Premium was too shiny and did not look right . Kodak and HP paper did not work at all . Neither did the cheaper stuff . When the price is right here on Amazon , stock up ! ! !	1
A word on photo quality . Using a Epson Artisan printer with the correct paper will produce better photos than you will get at a typical photo lab . I highly recommend the Epson Photo papers as they are designed for the Epson inks and the Epson printers specifically . I tested the `` Epson Premium Photo Paper Glossy '' and `` Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy '' and recommend both . Looking at the same image side by side on the two papers the differences are almost imperceptible . The detail and color are identical under the most careful scrutiny . A few differences emerge under very careful observation : * The Ultra Premium Paper is slightly heavier paper , this adds to its stiffness . When picking up a 4x6 '' photo from the 4 '' edge there is about half as much bend vs the Premium Paper . * The Ultra Premium Paper has an ISO brightness of 96 , versus 92 for the Premium Paper . This makes no difference in color rich areas of photos but in light highlights if you stare long enough you can convince yourself they are brighter in the Ultra Premium . Telling the difference in brightness requires good light , identical photos side by side , and far too much scrutiny . * The Premium costs about 12.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100* The Ultra Premium costs about 22.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100Given the quality differences are almost imperceptible and the price difference is almost double I 'd recommend the Premium for every day use and the Ultra Premium only if you are entering a photo contest or have money burning a hole in your pocket . Photos on the Premium paper will be better than you 'd get at your local Walgreens or Costco.Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy , 4 x 6 , 100 Sheets ( S042174 )	1
I was shopping for 4x6 photo paper for my Epson printer . The Epson Premium Paper was a good choice . Price is right and the quality is fine .	1
I 've been a user of Epson glossy photo papers for over a decade . I 've never had a problem with them . Colors are brilliant and do n't fade . Granted , some of that is ink performance , but the paper clearly lets the ink succeed ! If you have an Epson printer and are using Epson ink , look no further !	1
This was literally the only paper I could find in this size ! ! ! Luckily is does a decent job . Fills a nice niche as 11x14.worried they wont produce it much longer though .	1
I have used several different Epson photo papers . I prefer the ultrapremium and premium luster papers , especially when you are showing your prints or framing them . Otherwise , the premium gloss paper is an excellent buy .	1
This is just the size of paper I was looking for . The price was much better than I could find locally .	1
We take so many pictures and have an amazing picture printer , but in the end the paper is an important part in capturing that image just right . Epson photo paper leaves images clear and bright as well as smudge free . Overall a great photo paper and the price is great !	1
This color print paper works great on my Epson Stylus color printer . The only caveat I have is do n't lay the paper down on the clear plastic envelope that holds the paper as there is a sticky strip on the clear plastic that will ruin any paper it touches . Also do not leave the print paper out in the light keep it in the dark and in the box until you are ready to use it . Great stuff ! Is not terribly expensive either .	1
This paper works well with the Epson printer but I would not expect any less from Epson . I would like to see more than 20 sheets	1
I purchased this paper because it was the cheapest brand out there- and printing your own photos is an expensive hobby . I had intended to use Epson papers for trial runs or copies for friends . However , the quality of my photos was incredible using epson paper . The colors are much more vivid and they do n't fade over time as some photo papers do . I now use Epson paper for all my 4x6 photos and I save money !	1
prints are sharp with great color saturation . what more can you ask for from photo paper ?	1
This is a simple little mouse pad but works well . My only objection was that I ordered it along with a new keyboard , expecting them to be shipped together . The mouse pad , which cost around $ 3.00 , was shipped separately and $ 5.00 freight was added , which did not make this purchase cost-effective . Other than that , I have no complaints about the pad itself .	1
For me , I find this Belkin Standard Mouse Pad perfect for my home office . It looks great next to my desktop computer and works very well with my cordless mouse.In fact , I like this mouse pad so much , I purchased one that I keep in my laptop 's bag for on the go travel.This is a great quality mouse pad . In fact , I think that is a Best Buy ! Highly recommend this one !	1
It does the job , it has given me good use , but what all can one say about a mouse pad ?	1
It has a good size . It has a good surface to track on . It is very , very lightweight though . But it stays down just fine over time .	1
Great product for the price . Pretty standard mouse pad nothing extraordinary about it other than the price . It works for what it was meant to work for .	1
Pros : Smooth surface for the mouse to glide on . Visually appealing . Inexpensive.Cons : No grip on the bottom , so it does occasionally move when my kids are playing with it , but it slides back in place just as easily.Overall , We 've had this a few months and I 'm happy with this purchase . I 'd recommend it if you 're looking for a basic mouse pad to replace a cracked or outdated one .	1
These belkin mouse pads are cheap and effective . They are worth your consideration when you need a small pad for your mouse .	1
This is a simple , yet needed item , so I was thrilled to find such a good price . If you use a computer , eventually you go through these as they get dirty or frayed around the edges .	1
.This review is of the AT & T ; Trimline model 210 , made by Advanced American Telephone under license from AT & T . ; Along with similarly-shaped `` Trimstyle '' and other imitator models , there are readily available two other , similar phones entitled to use the term `` Trimline '' : one marketed by Northwestern Bell ( which sells a lot of corded phones ) ; the other the model 205 Trimline , as one expects a bit simpler than the model at hand . The model 210 Trimline has a long history of production at different sites , with few pauses from the mid-1960s to the present . During the early days of renting the phone from Ma Bell they were made in Indiana ( rotary models , too ) ; then ( according to Wikipedia ) tone models came out of Singapore , the Philippines , Mexico , China and again China . I think the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages of owning a newly made model 210 , and I 'll elaborate : PROS : Fully modular : not only the handset but the line cord is modular , including lead into the telephone base itself ( prior reviewers did not find that feature ) . This makes extending the line cord a breeze , substituting either a very long male/male phone cord , or inserting a modular ( F/F ) adapter in the middle of two conjoined male/male cords . I 've tried that and found fit-and-finish were fine with GE brand coupler from the `` Also bought '' recommendations at this site.A little heavier than some previous `` retro '' Trimlines , but of course not nearly so heavy as the originals of the Sixties and Seventies ; Receiver volume can be raised or lowered via switch on the outside of the handset ; Inside the phone below the number pad are found an OFF-LO-HI volume switch ( note that it is possible to turn the ringer off entirely , although some earlier reviews have said the contrary ) . Chirper is a moderate , office-style pitch , nothing extraordinary ; Can hold ( if the specs are right ) up to 13 stored numbers , although that may really mean ten stored numbers plus the three feature buttons for Fire , Police and Ambulance ; It can indeed mount on a wall -- just follow instructions.Small footprint and an acknowledged `` classic '' design , down to the rounded rectangular buttons on the handset . Lack of ringer bell notwithstanding , this is probably the Trimline design and touchpad layout that best mimics the Bell ( Western Electric ) Trimlines of 40 years ago.Switchable Tone/Pulse on handset should anyone still need to imitate rotary-dial `` pulls '' with Pulse ; Surprisingly cheap . This model retails at thirty-two .95 ( and you can expect to see it a great deal cheaper here ) Accessories are cheap , but color issues may arise ( see below ) ..CONS : No one really knows how long this particulate incarnation is going to last under ordinary residential use.. Some prior reviewers had their Trimlines fail almost immediately ; others have kept this same model no . for ten years and more ; Handset has buttons for `` Flash '' , `` Redial '' and `` Mem [ ory ] , '' but not a dedicated `` Hold '' button per se ; This is not a two-line phone ; even the cheapest of them cost more ; The `` lit '' handset is indeed so dimly lit as to be practically useless . At least no separate AC connection is required.There is nothing remotely domestic ( USA/Can ) about 210 's current manufacturing site , China ; The coiled handset cord provided is short ( a loop of about 32 inches stretched but not overstressed ; i.e . about 1.4 feet per side ) ; and . . .Finding a new longer coiled handset cord , while easy as to function with so many suppliers around , has proved to be a real BEAR when it comes to matching colors ! This AT & T ; white is more of an off-white , not the Polar white of GE/RCA white phone accessories , nor anyone else 's ivory , ash , or beige that I can determine . Technically `` off-white '' as a color still exists in the canon of AT & T ; accessories , but ... . please let me know if you find any.And speaking of which , despite a need , product instructions lack any attempt to sell accessories like phone cords by mail or web.SUMMARY : If you want a corded phone with a small footprint for light use that weighs a little more than was strictly necessary , the current 210 should serve . But if you want only one `` main '' corded phone for the living room , kitchen or office , there are plenty more choices out there . For about twice the money you can get a speakerphone white model out of Northwestern Bell and other Bell competitors and survivors ; with not only speakerphone but more memory , usually a dedicated ` Hold ' button . . . and at the higher price ranges genuine TWO-line phones make their appearance ! ( This may beg the question of why a second corded line is needed , but there are home/office situations where that 's for the best . ) Whether your backup is a rarely used cell phone prone to battery depletion , or a traditional corded phone like the Trimline 210 , test it every now and then . No one wants to come across failure during a real emergency situation.Along with its Brady Bunch-era charm , the Trimline 210 is a recognized design classic . If you find it a little too bland and you want to make a stronger nostalgia statement , repro-retro Princess phones are not hard to find . To buy American , some residential phones out of Cortelco that were manufactured in the USA can still be found . Good luck whatever your decision , and if any of you know how to find accessories ( peripherals ) like an AT & T ; coiled handset cord in their signature off-white version of white , kindly `` Comment '' here to that effect ! Thanks .	1
This model has all the features most people would want on a landline type phone , and mfg . by AT & T , I am expecting a long-lasting lifespan on this device . I wall-mounted mine ( easily ) and it has been operating perfectly !	1
finally a phone that you do n't need to plug into an electrical outlet , no power supply needed , just a phone jack.It 's just right , for $ 12 , it 's a steal .	1
What you have here is a quality , reliable phone . While it 's not like the updated models you see today , it serves its purpose , and serves its purpose quite well . When it comes down to it , no matter what kind of fancy phone you see in the world today , you 're still basically typing numbers in *just* to talk to someone . This is why ANY phone will do . The size , comfort and everything else does n't matter when it comes down to it . Do n't even get me started on `` ring tones '' . Geez.As long as the numbers work and the signal is clear , who cares ? The AT & T ; phone is exactly what you should buy . It 's a good old phone .	1
Best corded phone on the market -- voice quality , lighted keypad , small footprint . It 's everything I need .	1
Perfect replacement at reasonable cost for an old phone I had.You ca n't beat this phone for quality and value from AT & T & Amazon .	1
The AT & T ; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out . We bought three of these ( one for our house , shop , and my mother 's house ) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages ( more frequent than I like in our area ) .We have these connected to line splitters ( likeBelkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter ) and they work just fine . These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which , although limited , does give us some control . It is also handy that the keypad is `` backlit '' and draws power directly from the phone line , allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial , we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
this is a no frills corded phone.It works out of the box and the sound quality is sufficient- not special.for 10 bucks you ca n't expect too much but it met all my expectations	1
I lose electricity now and then and need to have a corded phone ... my other one died..lol ... THIS one is a great slim size AND the price is ridiculously low ! It 's a keeper !	1
Big numbers , NO batteries needed , just plug it in the telephone jack and you 're ready for flawless calls ! Buy one now !	1
Excellent simple old fashioned wired phone . I hate portable phones because their sound quality is never as good as wired . I mounted this on the bathroom wall . Good quality for the low price .	1
A corded land line with a lighted dial , good sound quality , and the ability to have 'saved ' numbers for easy redialing .	1
We needed a corded phone to use during winter power outages here in rural northern Vermont . I tried a couple of the cheapo Radio Shack specials and they were absolutely unsatisfactory with small cramped buttons , unlit keypads , and poor volume . I went through the reviews and settled on this AT & T ; handset and it 's worked out very , very well.PROS : - The handset is sizeable and you can actually get a decent grip on it.- The ear receiver is larger than other handsets and actually fits right on the ear . This does n't sound like much , but it makes a difference in a noisy atmosphere.- The buttons are good sized and light well enough to see in dim lighting.- The volume is adjustable and even though I am slightly hard of hearing , it is more than adequate without turning it all the way up.- The price ! The price ! The price ! It 's a bargain ! CONS : - The base is light for a desk-top type phone . Got to be careful when you yank it around - it will fly off the counter . ( Alternately , it does mount on the wall . ) - The handset cord is too short . I read this in the other reviews so I did order a 12-foot stretchable replacement handset cord with the phone and I 'm glad I did . If you buy this phone , you should too.All in all , it 's a very , very good phone . Good quality at a great price .	1
This is a very nice phone for the price and I have no complaints . Good sound quality and easy to handle and use .	1
You learn that when there is a power outage , the cordless will not work because the base is plugged into the electrical socket so its a good little phone to have plugged into a landline that 's there when you need it , even if you have a cell phone ... .because you could have a low battery and this landline though to some out dated , it sure helps in a pinch . !	1
I 've been using the Trimline phone since it was called the Princess Phone back in the Ma Bell days . Except back then , they were more expensive . My old ones were getting staticy , so they were overdue for replacement . I threw them out and bought two of these . This thing is ten bucks , and it works great . I have a white one and a black one so that I will have a little variety and political correctness in my home .	1
I bought this for when the power goes out . It works great and the price was right for a backup phone .	1
I bought this on Amazon because of the price for my replacement land line . it is a good phone and it has a good sound to it . it is not tinny in my ear as some phones are . Let 's face it , it 's only a matter of time until the land line phone is history along with the phone book so I was n't spending a lot of money on it . The ringer is nice and not annoying as some are . I am happy with my purchase .	1
This is a good basic corded telephone . I lost my electricity this morning and of the four telephones I have , this was the only one that worked during the outage , even though my other telephones have battery back ups.I recommend this telephone for someone who is not concerned about frills .	1
If you 're looking for a very basic phone that is of high quality and durability , this is the phone for you ! It met my expectations in every way . Of course I like that the AT & T name stands behind it . I have always known them to produce quality products and stand by their products if there happened to be any problem . As I said though , this phone is the basic ... no caller ID , etc. , no bells and whistles ... just a phone with great sound clarity that seems like it will last me as long as I need to use it . I 'm very satisfied with my purchase . The phone itself even looks nice . I got it in white ... shows the dust less ! Ringer volume is perfect and adjustable , as is the voice volume . There are also three one-touch speed-dials for emergency numbers or that special someone you want to keep reachable at your fingertips ! I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who needs a basic communication device and who still believes in the AT & T name . You ca n't go wrong purchasing from Amazon at this price either ... it 's really remarkable all you get for such an inexpensive phone ! Best wishes talking on your new AT & T phone !	1
I 've loved the trimline phone ever since I got my first phone more than 20 years ago . Then , the trimline was a real , Bell System , telephone . Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones , it still has the great , comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset , which makes it an excellent choice . I 've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone , but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT & T ; version.If you read the other reviews , you will see that at least one review ( dated November of 2004 ) says that this phone was discontinued . Yet , here we are in late November 2004 , and its still around . I 'm guessing ( could be wrong here ) that this phone will be around forever , even though AT & T ; no longer promotes it on their web-site .	1
I recently bought this phone after several two more expensive models failed ; his telephone by AT & T ; and Lucent works better than the other phones I bought when I had to get a new phone for my home . The construction of this telephone reflects great engineering ; and it 's very , very reliable for a price that 's very inexpensive these days for a phone . Yes , it is corded ; but when all you really need is a basic phone this really does the job . Besides , the fact that this is corded means you 'll never misplace the cordless handset ! The phone has back lit buttons which are desirable for those of us who are elderly or in any way sight impaired . The buttons could be brighter but the back lighting does improve upon no lighting . The phone offers well known features including `` last number redial , '' too . The phone has a mute feature , adjustable ringer volume and more . These functions never disappoint me . It also has a small knob that lets you switch between touch tone and pulse ( rotary ) dialing . I use touch tone dialing as most people do . I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing . Cool ! However , as another reviewer correctly notes , when you program the phone to remember frequently dialed numbers , you need to actually dial the number -- so hang up fast if you do n't intend to speak with that person at just that moment ! I do n't care for that so I will take off one star for this.If you want to take a nap without the phone ringing , just turn the ringer off by using the knob at the base of the phone . That 's an incredibly useful feature ! I highly recommend this telephone for people who merely want a basic , inexpensive phone that still has a few `` frills '' to like including memory speed dialing and mute . The extra features give you all you truly need to make this a well constructed telephone at a rather inexpensive price . Sure , the back lighting for the buttons on the phone could be brighter ; but overall this is still quite a good phone for the price . The phone takes up little space and it can even be wall mounted to completely save counter space in a kitchen or any other room .	1
We just replaced an older AT & T 210 corded phone with a new one because the sound on the old one had become difficult to hear . We use the phone as a kitchen wall phone . The new 210 is lighter than the older one it replaced but seems identical otherwise . This phone is competitively priced and fulfills our needs so we can recommend it without reservation .	1
A classic , well made phone like they all used to be . Feels good in your hand and sounds good when you listen . Inexpensive but made well .	1
We like to keep one non-electric phone in the house in case power goes out . We have learned that during hurricanes , earthquakes and even big power failures that sometimes even cell phones do n't work but these non-electric phones that plug right into the telephone outlet work when other things do n't -that is if your phone service is not from the cable company but driectly from the telephone company . In regular day-today activies we use only cordless and cell phones but they can be useless in an emergency so we like the safety of having one phone like this . This is fine little phone and the price as great .	1
It 's a good basic phone and perfectly worth the price ( roughly $ 10 ) . It 's just like you remember from your childhood except in plastic . My only complaint is that the lighted keypad is n't very bright .	1
Does the job and not too flimsy . However , like many lightweight phones , easy to pull off a table when the handset cord gets twisted . If you rely on just your cordless phones , you are making a mistake . During a power failure , you will not be able to use landline service.I use this on one side of a King bed and a cordless on the other . We have lots of short term outages here , but last week we were out 3+ days after an ice storm . Most landline service will continue to work for a few days during power failures , but you need a hardwired phone at home . This is an inexpensive way to go .	1
I use this phone for a buck up in case the electricity fails and my cordless phones do not work . I like it much better than similar phones because this phone has a replaceable phone to handset cord . Most similar phones are hardwired so you can not replace the cord in case something goes wrong or you want a longer reach cord	1
No caller id , no bells and whistles . This is a basic solid well made phone . Buttons are large and easy to press . Has 3 speed dials and 10 memory locations . Last number redial . Tone/pulse switchable . One drawback -- you CAN NOT program a `` pause '' if you need to dial `` 9 '' for an outside line ; not a big deal , but you should be aware of that.The phone works very well . I hear clearly and the people hear me clearly . The handset is large and that makes it easy to hold . You can also easily attach a shoulder cushion for holding the phone on your shoulder . The handset is a tad heavy so I would n't use it for hour long calls , but it 's perfect for extensions . And it works in a power failure without batteries.For 10 bucks no one should complain about this phone .	1
The AT & T ; Trimline 210 corded phone certainly is n't encumbered with a lot of bells and whistles , but it has enough extras to suit my purpose.We have a 35-year-old home we built . It 's a large house with many rooms and the old analog sets were not functioning properly , so I replaced four sets with this trimline model where I can use three one-touch buttons for memory dial and store ten numbers in speed dial . Our cordless sets handle other requirements nicely , but since we 're in a cell dead zone and an area with frequent power outages , it 's really nice to have an old reliable set . The trimline is just that.Decently made ( though sadly not in the USA -- no corded telephones are made in the US any more ) with just enough extras which include a lighted keypad , a mute button which allows you to hear your caller but prevents them from hearing you , Flash which allows easy access to Call Waiting ( if you subscribe to this service ) and Redial which redials the last number called.Setup was a snap ( two phones installed as wall phones , two as table models ) and all phones now have the speed dial numbers stored for quick access . Simple and efficient , and very affordable .	1
If you 're looking for a neat , professional look with your giftwrapping , this tape is a big help . It 's invisible on the variety of wrapping papers I tried it on . It holds tightly and does n't curl in on itself . I found it significantly easier to use than regular Scotch tape .	1
This tape does nearly disappear on gift wrap and does hold very securely -- almost too securely ; while wrapping Christmas gifts , I realized how dependent I was on being able to carefully peel back a bit of tape and reposition it when necessary . That ca n't be done with this tape ; once it 's stuck , it 's stuck.The one thing I did n't like about the tape is that it was somewhat hard to tear off the roll . This is n't a big deal ; it 's not like trying to tear , say , adhesive tape , but it often took a couple stabs before the edge of the tape hit the cutter edge just right so the piece of tape would tear off . This fumbling occasionally caused the tape to reel out too far , or to contact the gift wrap before the tape was torn off the roll ( picture holding down gift wrap and tape roll with one hand , pulling tape and tearing with the other ) , and of course once it encountered the gift wrap , too bad if it was n't in the right spot . No peeling it off.If this product and the old standby , Scotch Magic Tape , were available at the same price , I would probably buy this one for gift wrapping since the matte finish and secure sticking were nice on the gifts . However , if it was priced higher , I 'd probably stick with Magic Tape , since it disappears and sticks nearly as well , and it does n't have the tough-to-tear issues .	1
We ordered this a while ago and have only really used it now that the holidays are in full gear . This is very impressive tape . It does exactly what it says it does . It virtually disappears once you put it on wrapping paper . After I wrapped some presents for my office party , I asked my two young sons to look for the tape . They only found it by pressing down on the package and feeling for the tape edge . Pretty impressive ! In addition to this , it is strong . As with all scotch tape , once you put it down it really holds paper in place . Overall , this is a very impressive product that does exactly what it was created to do . Thus , five stars .	1
What can I say , it 's Scotch tape . I could certainly use the 3 rolls of tape as Christmas is quickly approaching .	1
This is my favorite type of tape . It looks so `` dainty '' with the satin finish . It is perfect for gift wrapping , such as it was intended.But you can use it for whatever you want.It looks so delicate and smooth.With the holidays coming up , this tape is perfect for wrapping.Looks aside , this tape does its job . It is strong and durable.Highly recommended .	1
Life is too short to wrap gifts with `` bargain '' tape ... Ok , perhaps that is going a bit far , but when I think about all the times I have struggled with tough , bargain brand tape when I am trying to wrap a gift , it makes me wonder what I was thinking . Sure , if it is what you have at the time , then cheap tape can get the job done.But if you are anything like me , wrapping a gift nicely is enough of a struggle . Dealing with tape that does n't want to break when you cut it , tape that wo n't cut straight , tape that is slightly yellow , well , for me anyhow that is a frustration I am glad to do without during the holidays . By the time I am done struggling with some off brand roll of tape , it certainly does n't seem like a `` bargain '' .I would not go so far as to say this tape is invisible , but the satiny finish somehow blends in just perfectly on the wrapping paper to where you almost ca n't see it.And with 3 rolls , it means no arguing for the tape roll when I am wrapping gifts with the kids.I would say that I was somewhat surprised at how little tape was on each roll . I am not sure if that was because I got it as promotional item , but as I said having the 3 separate rolls comes in handy , especially if you have kids.Sure , kids will find something else to argue about , and you will find other problems to concern yourself with , but tape does n't have to be one of them if you use Scotch brand gift tape . As I like to say - quality does n't really cost , it pays .	1
There 's not a lot I can say about Scotch brand tape except that it is of the highest quality . Whenever I cave in and buy the cheap store brand tape , I always regret it . Scotch 's quality is more than worth the price.This pack of Magic tape includes three rolls of 300 inches . Though they could have packed a bit more tape on each roll , this is still a good deal and an excellent holiday tool .	1
The satin finish is supposed to make this more invisible than regular `` Magic '' tape when used on gift wrap . To my eyes , there is almost no difference . So the only reason to get this is if the price is better than regular `` Magic '' tape . As I write this review , it is ! To be clear , there 's nothing WRONG with this tape . It works just as well as regular `` Magic '' tape . It 's very hard to see when applied . And , I assume , it 'll have the same remarkable durability as regular `` Magic '' tape . It 's just that it 's special feature ( satin finish , more invisible on gift wrap ) does n't work .	1
I was skeptical that I would see a difference with this tape compared to regular Scotch tape , so I wrapped two presents : one in regular Scotch tape and one in this Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.The first difference is that the Gift Wrap Tape seems to be slightly more heavy duty . After wrapping , it is also clear that the gift wrap tape was less cloudy and did indeed look better than the present wrapped in regular tape . I would n't say that the difference was dramatic , but it was enough.So overall , as long as there is not much of a price difference I would definitely say go with the Gift Wrap Tape in situations where you want whatever you are taping to look nice .	1
The best tape for gifts - Scotch is the only brand I use . Pre-cut pieces to make it easier while wrapping a present as it makes it so convenient to use . I recommend highly !	1
This 3-pack of Scotch tape works really well but the thing is , especially during the holidays with Christmas approaching , you 'll go through 3 of these very quickly . Even when you try to conserve , a situation will probably arise when you 'll be using it more than you 'd like . I believe if you have a family of 4 or more , a 3-pack is enough to hold your family over for a few months , however again , this stuff is easily used up like it grows on trees during the Christmas present-wrapping holiday season . Since it 's not very expensive to buy ( less than 9 bucks at the moment including shipping and handling ) I recommend buying at least two 3-packs ( 6 packs total ) . Hey you never know when that extra pack will come in handy . Anyway the tape is sticky and reliable enough that I can easily recommend it to anyone and let 's be honest , we *all* will unexpectedly need Scotch tape for one reason or another , and it 's good to have a pack around when these moments come .	1
You expect tape to do a couple tasks : Adhere and disappear.Scotch does both . 3 rolls ... means more of what tape needs to do .	1
I think this is the best tape for your money and it 's the kind I always buy . It 's virtually invisible upon use and it 's not too expensive . I wo n't use any other tape for gift wrapping .	1
What can you say about great tape ? It sticks , it tears easily from the dispenser , and it disappears on the gift wrap , except on foil wrapping were you can still see it a little . I 'd get it again for sure .	1
This is a `` third generation '' Scotch tape . Like the Scotch tape of old , it has a shiny surface , unlike the second-generation `` Magic Tape '' Scotch tape which virtually disappears on paper with a conventional `` rough '' surface . It 's virtually undetectable on shiny gift wrap . It also has more `` body '' than the Magic Tape variety , making it easier to use .	1
This Scotch Satin GiftWrap Tape does what tape should do - it 's easy to use , sticks to paper effortlessly and is great for wrapping gifts . I found that the satin finish did a nice job disappearing - not like the cheap stuff that has a shiny finish . The price is reasonable too . All in all , this is a great product .	1
Does what it says . You can barely see this tape so any presents you wrap will look flawless . Now I 'm going to confess that Scotch makes the best tape for everything . They also make packaging tape that is very easy to use .	1
This tape works great for gifts because it almost disappears after you put it on to give a nice clean look . The quaily of the actual dispenser has gone down hill over the years probably to save costs or the enviornment . It still works ok , but it is sort of flimsy compared to the good old days . But with that small issue aside I still like the tape and plan to continue using it for years to come .	1
3M is probably one of the most innovative companies in the world . They can take one product and make a thousand slightly different corresponding products from that base product . They have done that again with the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape . When you compare it to the standard tape with a non-gloss finish , this tape blends into the packaging material better than the standard . It gives a nice look that basically hides the tape from a distance.There are two negatives that I noticed : The tensile strength is slightly higher thus it makes it slightly more difficult to tear . It also seems to roll up on me with longer strips than the older standard version . Therefore the 4 stars .	1
. . . and it does what it is supposed to do . I just went through two rolls wrapping gifts -- and it seems a little more substantial and thicker than cheaper tapes , it is n't the slightest bit shiny , so it disappears on packages , it 's easy to tear , the dispenser was sturdy enough that the tape did n't come off the serrated part and stick to itself , and in using the entire two rolls I never had to engage in the frustrating process of trying to find the end and then peel it off of the rest of the roll . My only beef -- there 's not much tape on the rolls . They 're kind of like rolls of wrapping paper , in that it always looks like there 's more there than you actually get.It 's tape . It 's pretty good tape , and a pleasure to use , but it is just tape . I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again , though I do n't expect it to change my life .	1
I have 5 November birthdays and each of them got a few presents . This Scotch tape is perfect . It tears off nicely and when you put it on your packages , you ca n't even notice it 's there . Scotch is the only brand I ever got but they improved the quality of this tape by making it invisible.Also , the price on Amazon is great . I highly recommend it if you are fussy with your packages like I am .	1
Scotch Giftwrap Tape may not be new , but if you 've never tried it , now 's the time ! It is made with a special satin or semi-gloss finish that makes the tape virtually invisible on most giftwrap paper . Try it on a package and you 'll be surprised at how it disappears . Scrapbookers might want to experiment with this tape as well . With all of the holiday gift wrapping near , you really need to get some of this tape - you will be rewarded with praise for your professional looking packages . Very highly recommended !	1
I probably would n't use this tape for gift wrapping after realizing -like many of the other reviewers- that there is not a whole lot of tape on each roll . I 'm not so concerned that my gifts look impeccabl , so I would n't pay more for this product for that use . BUT , I had some beloved children 's books that my kids have been rough on and pulled out the tape today to see how it faired compared to the regular tape that I normally use to tape up little tears and bends and this stuff is AWESOME ! It feels much thicker and more durable than regular tape and is nearly impossible to see . I pulled out one book that has lots of bad bends , some tears , and the binding is wearing off . I taped every single little thing to see how it would look afterwards and to see how durable it felt . I was completely impressed ! I seriously could n't see where I had taped and it felt really strong . And the book looked and felt 100 times better than the books that I used regular tape on . It is also important to note that the tape feels really silky and soft and it it difficult to feel where the edges are . I 'm not sure how they did that , but I love it ! I will DEFINITELY keep some rolls on hand for book repairs because I think it would be worth the slightly additional cost for the vast improvement in look and durability .	1
After trying cheaper brands of tape , I always return to Scotch tape because of the quality . This is no different . Does what it is marketed for , not showing up on gift wrap . Like that it disappears because the package does look nicer without seeing the tape . Would like to see if it comes in 1/2 inch size . I find the 3/4 inch too wide .	1
While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together , it shows up very easily on gift wrap , being all shiny . The matte or satin finsh on this is perfect for gifts.. doesnt attract or reflect light , so that you see the wrapping paper and not the tape . Very simple and it works.Con : this type of tape is really for gift wrapping and isnt as attractive for normal everyday use , but it can be used as such . Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion .	1
Ever since I was a little kid I have loved this Scotch glossy tape . It 's the only brand and variety of tape that I will buy . It 's a little unfortunate that they market this as `` gift wrap tape '' because while it is ideal for gift wrap ( it literally disappears ) , it 's also perfect for any other task requiring tape . On some surfaces the glossy-ness of the tape will stick out , I still prefer that glossy-ness to the dull-ness that you get by using regular tape . I also find this stuff to be stickier and easier to work with ( long pieces ) than the regular Scotch 'matte ' tape . Note that Amazon probably is n't your best bet for buying the stuff , as I often see it cheaper at local stores .	1
Maybe I 'm taking advantage of the vine here , but this comes just in time for the holiday wrapping season . I like the strips I reviewed ealier , but these are just as good when I 'm in the thick of the package wrapping experience . They are right , I can step back a few feet and I can not see the tape on the paper when it turns invisible on contact . The 3/4 inch size is just right for packages , the half inch stuff is too skinny and too easy to tangle when pulling loner strands off the rolls.Tape like this can be taken for granted unless you have some of the old dimestore stuff around and try and use it . Hard to get off the roll , breaks easy , gets yellow all problems not happening with this cheap stuff . Why does n't it get five stars , well one can say this is a five star product , but they 've not done much inovation in the last several years . Can they inovate , I do n't know , maybe it 's too perfect now , but sooner or later everything gets better , and I challenge 3M to improve this .	1
This is great tape for wrapping presents , it truly does become almost invisible when applied to the wrapping paper . It 's easy to use , tears easily , and I love that it 's a 3 pack . Maybe nothing in the world is more frustrating than running out of tape mid package ! I highly recommend this tape !	1
This stuff is fantastic . If you love wrapping packages that have that `` Ooh , how did you do that without the tape showing '' look , be SURE to grab this stuff ! Been buying it for years and have used it as a professional wrapping staple since it was introduced . Lasts forever , is a great 3/4 '' wide so it covers those larger package ends . Great quality , MADE IN THE USA ! , highly , highly recommend !	1
I wrap a lot of gifts at the holiday season . I am more into wrapping with wrapping patterned paper than the expensive option of gift bags . So I tend to be very picky when it comes to my paper and tape . I love this tape , I 've been buying it for a few years . It is actually a little bit more shiny than the regular Scotch tape , but blends into wrapping paper better than regular Scotch tape . I used to use the double stick tape , but that was getting too expensive , especially with the kids just ripping off the paper quicker than you can say `` boo '' . I am the one who cares so much about how the finished gift wrapping looks , yes I admit that . But when giving a gift to someone other than my own family , looks do mean a lot . I spent a lot of time deciding what to give this person , so when I wrap it , I want it to look like I care . So I use this tape.I like to think that fingerprints do n't seem to show as easily as regular Scotch tape , but that may just be wishful thinking . It seems that with this Gift Wrap tape , the actual adhesive on the film is more microscopic so you ca n't see the texture like you do with regular Scotch tape.As far as the 3 roll thing , I much prefer to buy a regular roll and put it into a dispenser . The flimsy dispenser that the rolls come in in the 3 roll pack are very basic . The length of tape you get with the 3 roll pack is a lot shorter than a single roll , so if you have many gifts to wrap , then consider buying more of the single rolls . Another reason you might like the single roll is because the serrated edge for the tape cutter is much more crude than a heavy desktop tape dispenser or even a regular plastic dispenser . I prefer the weight of the desktop tape dispenser when wrapping a lot of gifts . Its a bit easier to tear off the tape with that weight in it , and it 's more of a one handed job than a two handed job .	1
We 've only ever use Scotch tape at my house , it 's the tape that holds up better in not ripping or tearing when you do n't want it to . It 's always been stronger in keeping this together than the cheaper brands . The Gift Wrap tape is excellent for wrapping any gifts as it boasts a certain amount invisibility . It does n't completely disappear , of course , but it 's less noticeable than other kinds of tape . The price for three roles is pretty cheap as well . I would definitely recommend this Scotch Gift Wrap for any holiday or birthday wrapping you need .	1
What , exactly , can you say about Scotch Tape ... ? It was intended for gift-wrapping , and it does it 's job nicely . My Wife is a fanatical wrapper , and hates when you can see the tape on the wrapped presents , and the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape passed her highly critical eye with flying colorsThanks for making my Holiday season a little bit easier , Scotch . ; )	1
I normally just use regular tape to seal wrapping paper and thought it looked fine . Well , after using this gift wrapping finish tape , I do n't think I will be going back to standard tape . The wrapping paper no longer shows the tape as easily and it just looks more `` professionally '' wrapped . It just makes the gift look more pleasing . It 's amazing what a visual difference it makes.I highly recommend this product .	1
I love this tape for gift wrapping because you almost ca n't tell the tape is there , unlike the green version . It does the job and blends in with the wrapping beautifully .	1
I finally had a chance to try this product while undergoing a Christmas present wrapping marathon.I used three types of tape : Scotch Gift Wrap tape , Scotch Magic tape , an off brand matte tape and an off brand glossy/shiny tape.I also wrapped using tissue paper , glossy wrapping paper , and dollar store wrapping paper.The Scotch Gift Wrape tape outperformed the other three on all areas . THe most noticable being when I used tissue paper . The tape was completely invisible . Even the Magic tape showed up.There was a huge difference in the ease of the tape . The Gift Wrap tape was silky and smooth and went easily from dispenser to paper . It did n't pick up any dust or anything else in transit . I was wrapping on a carpeted basement floor with a dog nearby . The off brands actaully picked up dog hair and dust on the way from the dispenser to the wrapping paper.Overall , there is no comparison between the Scotch Gift Wrap tape and the others . It is worth the price ( and I 'm saying this as a cheapskate ) because less is wasted due to the quality.I would buy this regularly in the future and I would recommend this to all .	1
You can NOT go wrong with scotch tape . It 's a classic . This definitely came in handy on Black Friday when I sat down after shopping and wrapped all my gifts . My fiance was so outdone when he came home and saw gifts already wrapped ! : ) lol	1
I have routinely spent a lot of money on nice , colorful gift wrap and then , when I get the gift wrapped all that seems to stand out is the tape that is used to seal the package . This gift wrap tape actually becomes invisable on the package and lets your gift wrap show through . It does n't cost much more to make your gift wrapping look really professional . I used this tape on both a solid blue colored wrap and a mulit-colored paper and it worked great on both . It was also invisable where I used the tape to attach the little envelope with the gift tag and note , I recommend this tape and will probably end up using it for more than just gift wrapping.. it 's a very nice tape for everyday use as well .	1
I guess you might say tape is tape is tape but there are varying qualities from the cheap generic to the more expensive name brands like Scotch . Right here around the Holiday Season gift wrapping is certainly something we 're doing a lot of so a set of three rolls of tape comes in very handy . This particular tape sticks on flat and clear so as not to obscure your wrapping paper . A definitive advantage over the cheaper tape is that the adhesive is very strong - this tape is not going to pop off the paper as you work on a complex wrap job . Once it is in place it stays . I like that . It pulls from the roll and tears off well on the cutting teeth . Overall it is good quality tape .	1
We use Scotch Gift wrap tape for all our wrapping of presents . It is a superior product in every way .	1
Most commercial gift wrap has a sheen as we all know . We , a long time ago , used regular Scotch tape , the one in the red roller that we all grew up with . It was always very visable because of the shine on the tape . Mending a torn page in a book would always be very obvious and after time it would yellow a bit . Then came the green lable -- -major improvment . It had a non-gloss surface that really works well for mending torn book pages etc . However it was still noticable on gift wrap as the paper had more sheen than the tape -- -- and now , we have a solution to this heart wrenching problem . Seriously , Scotch GiftWrap is a noticable improvment , it is as close to invisable as one could get as the sheen is about the same as the paper ! You get the tape stuck in the wrong place and try to remove it , you have a mess . With this product , you just ca n't spot the goof up ! ( If you every saw my gift-wrap ability , you would understand why I like it so much ) . It really is a good quality product and does what it claims so I think the four stars are earned !	1
I 'm not real sure what I 'm supposed to say about this stuff in a review . I mean , is there anybody in the United States who is n't familiar with Scotch tape ? It 's the grand daddy of all cellophane tapes , and this gift wrap tape just adds a couple features that make Scotch tape better and better . First , it 's a handy three pack , just in time for Christmas and assuring even the biggest of gift givers enough tape to wrap everything . Then , there 's the satin finish , which becomes darn near invisible on patterned paper , and pretty close to that on everything else . Finally , it sticks . This is a great product , and I do n't see how I could n't give it five stars .	1
Works great - Easy tear - Can not notice it on Christmas packages - Comfortable dispenser and highly affordable ! What more can ya want in tape ? ?	1
Sure , regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping , but if you want your gifts to look like they 're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost do n't know it 's there , this is the tape for you . The best thing about this tape is that you virtually do n't see it on most gift wrapping paper . The satin finish is n't too shiny or mattte . It holds very well and the three pack is a convenient size . Now that I 've used this tape , I just ca n't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip : If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it 's on the gift , the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product !	1
Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape , 3/4 inch , 3 rolls . With its semigloss ( or satin as they call it ) finish , the tape looks very nice on gifts and it 's hardly noticeable . While it might not actually disappear on the paper , I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they 're busy tearing open gifts . The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it . However , my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser , which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape . I 'd rather get more tape , even if it means paying more , so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll , and there would be far less waste . Altogether , the tape is nice and the price seems fair .	1
We 've long been fans of Scotch brand products - always finding them dependable . The same is true of this Scotch Gift Wrap Tape . It 's that time of year again and we 've made good use of this already . It holds wrapping securely yet is transparent enough not to spoil the colorful paper.We also use it to cover addresses on parcels to be mailed , knowing it will protect the ink even if the packages are caught in a wet blizzard.The holidays are n't the only times this tape comes in handy as we 've used it to repair torn pages in a notebook , by doubling it we 've used it to attach To-From cards and , believe it or not , in a real hurry it held the torn hem of a skirt.You never know what it might be used for next - only that you 'd better have some on hand .	1
I 've never had an issue with the way normal tape looks when wrapping presents , but this tape does really disappear and it looks good . You can still see the tape of course but it 's much less visible than normal tape.If you wrap a lot of presents or are a Martha Stewart-type perfectionist , you might want to consider this tape . The other 99 % of us can just use normal tape ! : )	1
The tape - at first I wondered : `` How can this be different ? '' . The answer is rather subtle ... the tape has a strong backing with a semi-gloss ( satin if you will ) finish . For a `` tape collector '' I guess it is slightly between `` magic '' and clear tape . * Not a big deal to me and most people , but hey different strokes for different folks.Also it is considered `` photo safe '' I guess that means it wo n't yellow over time like tape from the 70s does/has .	1
This is by far my favorite type of tape to use for gift wrapping . The tape breaks off of the roll easily , and does not bend or warp . The tape always sticks well , holds tight and remains clear . A very attractive option for gift wrapping .	1
Now this is what I needed . Very clear and at a great deal . Its hard to see the tape on the gifts I had to wrap . Tried some cheaper tape . What a mistake . For now on I am going to use this .	1
This tape is perfect for wrapping all of your presents . It completely dissapears into the paper and makes your gifts look flawless . It has a strong hold and you do n't need to use a lot of it in order to make the paper stay .	1
Sounds like a miniscule item to be concerned about , but this is great tape . It makes your packages look so much better and is a dream to use . Does n't get stuck where you do n't want it and virtually disappears on paper .	1
I hate wrapping gifts , so I really liked how easy the tape made it . You could n't see the fingerprints , it has a nice finish to it , and the pieces are precut to a nice short length . I found this all very helpful . I read on one of the reviews that there was a complaint about the amount of tape that was on these rolls , and I have to agree that there was n't as much , but for me that was a minor negative . I think this tape is pretty great and sure is convenient .	1
The finish on this tape is ideal for gifts in that it tends to disappear over most types of wrapping , to give that special present a little extra touch beyond straight plastic tape .	1
This tape has an excellent adhesive , sticking to paper or foil with no problem . As advertised , the tape is almost invisible on the package . Scotch make quality tape and this is no exception .	1
The tape is not shiny it has a matte finish and does n't stick out when used on gift wrap . It also tears easily with the dispenser it comes in.It is good and sticky . The glue did n't wear off at all .	1
This new gift wrapping tape and the Scotch brand magic transparent tape I have been using for years are very similar . The old tape is translucent with a foggy finish . The new tape is slightly clearer and more glossy . It does n't accept ink or pencil marks so easily , but you can write on it with a Sharpie.Overall , the old tape is more useful .	1
It 's tape . How different can tape be ? Well very , with the Scotch people ! The gift wrap tape sealed all the package to the point where many receivers could not locate what was holding their presents together . I , for one , enjoyed the frustration on their faces trying to open their gifts . Merry Christmas !	1
You buy a nice gift and you want to wrap it for that special person to whom you are going to give it . You found the perfect gift wrap paper , cut the paper perfectly and fold every crease to perfection . Now use the best tape there is to seal the deal ! Scotch Giftwrap Tape has a unique satin finish that helps the tape disappear on the wrapping paper . It seals tightly and it is easy to dispense and cut . It does n't yellow or show air bubbles and provides the finishing touch on the package . Tape that does n't show up so much that it steals the beauty of your wrapping job.Do n't forget the ribbon !	1
this package of Scotch Gift Wrap Tape was a great help in wrapping gifts this season . The tape is sturdy and invisible against the wrapping paper background . The perforated edge makes it easy break the tape off it 's role.The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that I would have liked more tape per roll . We went through these 3 tape dispensers very quickly . I typically like to buy the larger rolls . Otherwise , another great product from Scotch	1
I recently testedScotch Magic ( TM ) Tape 3105 , 3/4-inch x 300 Inches , 3-Packagainst Scotch 's ( R ) Satin Finish Gift-wrap tape . Both were both 3/4 inches wide.You ca n't go wrong with either of these products ! They both came in the very familiar and proven dispensers - nothing fancy , and they just work well.I was surprised to see that the Matte Finish product was actually more invisible than the Satin Finish Gift-wrap product - but unless you saw them side by side , you 'd never know.The Satin Finish Gift Wrap Tape did allow me to easily remove or reposition the tape . Either way , find the best price , keep it simple , and use either of these tape products - you will not be disappointed !	1
You are a person who cares about details . The normalScotch Magic ( TM ) Tapeis fine for the hoi polloi . `` Invisible tape '' they call it , the deluded fools . But you can see its flaws , how it holds an air bubble , how it calls attention to itself with an ugly matte finish that makes anything below it look slightly washed out , faded like a painting left too long in a sunny room.You are a person who notices details . When you are wrapping a gift -- with wrapping paper that folds just so , without little crinkles -- when you are wrapping a gift you want the smooth lover 's touch of satin against your fingers , a shiny surface that light will caress into a soft shine . It calls attention to itself only when the light walks ups to it , makes a graceful bow , and asks it to dance.You are a person who pays attention to details . You like that this tape is determined `` Photo Safe '' according to the rigorous ISO Standard 14523 . You wo n't be seeing your fingerprints outlined in dirt and grease , trapped like some ancient insect in amber . Yes , you might be frustrated that the dispenser leaves tiny lines where the tape meets the ledge with the jagged teeth and where it pulls out and away from the tight , perfect coil which 3M has so brilliantly engineered . But you 'll figure out this can be managed with skillful snips from a sharp set of scissors.The details are important to you . Is it Scotch GiftWrap Tape or Scotch Giftwrap Tape ? The packaging says both . Perhaps 3M should hire you to proofread the names of their products , you think to yourself , with a congratulatory inner voice . You would n't let a detail like that slip by .	1
I 've been using Scotch Gift Wrap Tape for years and there is nothing better . Cheaper tape can be fine for general purpose taping ( although I still prefer 3M products ) , but for gift-wrapping , quality is a must . This tape dispenses evenly and easily , cuts cleanly , applies easily , and is truly nearly invisible once applied . The tape holds well as long as stress is lateral to the tape . When the stress is perpendicular to the tape , it sometimes lifts . This is rarely the case when gift-wrapping . I think it is slightly less tacky than general-purpose tape . Sometimes you can lift it off if you make a mistake , but gift-wrap paper tends to be unforgiving . Because it is nearly invisible when applied , it is often best to cut the seam and leave the tape on the paper if you make a mistake . It is not noticeable . There is not must else to say about tape .	1
This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores . It adheres well , is less likely than many to tangle , and has a nice finish that disappears on the paper once it 's been applied . I 've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays , and it is just not worth it . The difficulties using those flimsy tape dispensers and lousy cutters , not to mention the tendency to curl up and tangle , make wrapping a chore . Well , this tape does n't make wrapping a pleasure , but it does make it easy and quick , with a lovely professional appearance .	1
I know , it 's tape . Scotch tape to be precise . But that is what sets this tape apart from the competition . Over the years , I 've had consistently better results with all forms of Scotch adhesive products . The difference is so noticeable that I buy Scotch tape products exclusively , regardless of price . And speaking of price , this is a very good price for a three pack of Scotch tape ! Scotch tape : * sticks better* cuts better* tends to bend more naturally* does n't seem to yellow/discolor as muchThis `` gift tape '' has a matte finish that hides finger prints and largely disappears on your gifts . If you 're looking for a matte-finish tape , I 'd definitely start here .	1
Last year when I ran into a gift wrapping crisis ( ran out of tape at night while the kids were in bed and my husband was on a business trip ) I called a neighbor and asked if she had tape I could borrow . She showed up at my door with a three pack of Scotch Gift Wrap tape . While it was n't my preferred tape [ I like the Magic Scotch tape ] it was tape and it allowed me to get the job done.I like this gift wrap tape , but I do n't love it . One gripe I have with this tape is it 's tougher than the magic tape . Because it 's sturdier , it 's not as easy to rip it off the dispenser . Numerous times I have gone to cut off a piece of this tape and it has bunched up on me . I never have that problem with the magic tape . This tape seems to be more adhesive than the magic tape as well . Once you put this on the gift wrap you are n't getting it off without damaging the paper unless you 're using the fancier foil wraps . This feature is nice if you 're trying to discourage peekers , but it 's not so great if you 're like me and you forgot what was in a particular unmarked package.I do like how nicely this tape disappears when it 's placed on gift wrap . The satin finish allows it to nicely blend in on the paper and does n't stand out like the glossy or the invisible tapes ( my experience with the invisible tapes is you wind up with a matte spot that stands out on a satin finish ) .	1
Like Kleenex , Zippers and Google , this is a product that 's so good at what it does we pretty much refer to ALL similar items by its name : Scotch tape.Unlike other brands , however , this is a strong tape with a nice , satin finish that disappears against matte wrapping papers . You do n't even have to rub it like crazy with the back of your fingernail to make it invisible , like some inferior brands . If you 're using a shiny foil paper you 'll want to stick with a tape that has a similar , shiny finish . ( Pardon the pun . )	1
I used this tape , which has more of a sheen than regular `` invisible '' tape , on several different kinds of gift wrap . It definitely blends better with papers with a slight gloss to them since it has a similar texture . On matte-surfaced papers like tissue wrap , craft paper , and `` natural '' papers , the slight sheen of the tape makes it show up more . For those who like their wrappings to be really fancy , this tape is a nice addition to wrapping supplies . It would also work well on any project with paper that has a slight gloss to it .	1
I have always liked Scotch brand products and this one is no different . I like that you get three rolls of this tape because if you are like me one is never enough when wrapping gifts . I love that the dispenser is easy to use . The tape comes off the roll very easily which is a huge plus in my opinion . I also love that the gift wrap tape is clear when you place in onto the wrapping paper . It makes the gifts a lot more appealing considering that you do n't have to look at tape `` lines '' . In my opinion the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is the best tape for wrapping gifts this holiday season.If you want a tape that is easy to use and looks great on your gifts look no further than Scotch Gift Wrap Tape . I do not think that you will be disappointed .	1
I always buy Scotch brand tape for use in my home ( no idea what stuff they buy at the office - ugh ) , and this Gift Wrap tape is what I purchase by by the box load for all use year ! The satin finish melts into giftwrap , and gives an especially nice finish to my packages . 3/4 '' is a good width for sealing giftwrap edges . The finish looks good on matte or shiny paper , and holds well . I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser , so I ca n't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes , and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas , then birthdays , Mother and Father 's Days , etc . Another winner from the folks who do `` sticky '' right .	1
I know , I know , terrible sense of humor . This tape , however , works exactly as you 'd expect , and even a little better . It disappears on gift wrap paper that does n't have a super glossy finish . Almost every gift wrap that you 'll find in stores will have a finish that works well with Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.The convenient three pack has plenty of tape for a pampered child 's birthday or for three of Santa 's elves to wrap a reindeer load of gifts . ( Seriously , 25 yds . of tape is a whole lot of tape ) For those of you traveling this holiday season with a small child who must be quiet , I offer one other use for this tape . Give your little kid a roll of tape and let him/her play with it . They 'll have strips of tape going all over the airplane seat and the tiny amount of space alotted to a passenger . When the plane lands , and Junior has finished with his tape , just roll it up into a ball and toss it into the closest trash container . I ca n't guarantee that this will work for everyone , but it kept my 2 year old quiet in her car seat during a 9 hour flight to Europe . She played with the tape until she tired of it , then fell asleep as I removed the played-with tape .	1
Scotch brand of tape is an oldie but goody , and its gift wrap tape is no different . The clear tape all but disappears on wrapping paper . It 's strong and gets the job done . Highly recommend .	1
Love the gift wrap tape ! One of my favorite activities in the world is wrapping gifts . I do n't know why . I just love matching bows and ribbons with the paper ! The great part about special gift wrap tape is that it is designed specifically to be invisible against wrapping paper -- not only is it transparent , but the ends blend into the paper . To this end , the Scotch Gift Wrap tape almost always succeeds . The only time it does n't , however , is when you have shiny or textured wrapping paper -- which I occasionally use . But you ca n't win them all . Oh , and as far as using cheapie off-brands ... Well , there 's always some items when you should always buy name brand : aluminum foil , saran wrap , toilet paper , AND duct or adhesive tape . That 's just my honest opinion .	1
It 's really great tape . It disappears onto semi-glossy to glossy gift wrap paper , but it 's got a slight sheen that will catch light on school projects . If you want tape that completely disappears on matte surfaces , go for the magic tape instead of this one .	1
In a way , I feel a bit silly reviewing tape , especially one that have been out for a very long time , which I has used fairly often , though not in a few years until I just got it about a month ago , but it feels odd , but regardless people need to know the truth about this tape ! ! ! In all seriousness , this tape , as are most 3MM products , wonderful . It works as intended and sticks to the wrapping paper and has a slightly matte finish , but not the same kind of `` white '' matte finish that the tape Scotch tape in the green package comes in , its almost a clear matte finish , and this is really the point of the tape . If you use the shiny finish , or a packaging tape , its too shiny and shows up too much on the paper because of its shine , and if you use the normal matte finish to tape the gift wrap , it will be just as obvious because it makes that area a lighter color , but this tape , does about as well as you can expect a tape of its kind to do , it sticks and its not screaming `` LOOK AT ME '' on the gift wrap because its too shiny or too matte , it has a good balance and thus is a good tape for gift wrapping , I suppose you could use staples or double sided tape ( I have done both ) , but you know , sometimes , just good ol ' tape works best . : DGod Bless ~Amy	1
I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping , and was very pleased with how it performed.First , it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape . It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything . Second , it holds VERY securely . If you 're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap , you 'll soon find that this tape behaves differently . Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite `` step up '' from my old stand-by , Scotch Magic Tape . Definitely outperforms it by a long shot .	1
Hmm , how to do a serious in-depth review of tape ? Let 's start at the beginning . This three-pack of Scotch GiftWrap ( the solid spelling is 3m 's ) comes in a purple carton that offers its own review : `` . . . . features a unique satin finish that disappears on most gift wrap papers . Makes your gifts look great ! Easy to dispense and sticks securely . `` The first thing I noticed is that the purple starter strip on each roll of tape lines up at a different point . I managed to grab one and pull the tape across the inch long gap so I can scrape it across the jagged plastic teeth for severing it . Why do all tape dispensers have this long gap between the roll and the cutting surface ? Invariably , the exposed tape picks up dust , lint , dirt , even small insects and then has to be discarded ( and the extra size seems a wasteful use of extruded plastic ) . Plus I tend to leave a fingerprint on the tape no matter how hard I try not to do so . 3M has a chance here to innovate instead of just replicate , but I 'll expect a cut from the production savings.Now in my tests , the unique satin finish actually disappears better ( if there can be degrees of disappearance ) on darker paper but shows up quite clearly on very light paper and on light areas of patterned gift paper . Are most gift wrap papers dark ? I 'm not sure 3M can substantiate its claim here.On to `` Makes your gifts look great ! '' I have to take issue with the semantics . This tape is not going to be applied to most gifts , so it really does not affect how they look . I know that 3M means the wrapped gift , but honestly , nothing makes a wrapped gift for me look that good . I 've never mastered the folding and sizing of the wrapping paper , and it is a running joke in my family that my skills in this area are marginal at best.But this extra-wide tape does make it easier to seal gift wrapping , whether one folds the paper with the precision of an origami expert or needs to span a revealing gap where the ends of the paper do not quite meet.Except for the inevitable fingerprints and occasional insect carcass , this tape is pretty easy to dispense until it detaches from the front of the dispenser , reattaches to the roll along an invisible seam , and triggers a torrent of cursing . It does stick securely as long as adults , not toddlers or cats , tug on the seams.Here is another point that may matter in some situations : this tape shares a quality with Silly Putty : it will lift ink from newsprint and from documents printed on inkjet printers , and sometimes it transfers that ink to other surfaces.When all is said and done it 's good to have a few rolls of this tape handy , and I 'm sure we will run through a couple of rolls during the flurry of gift giving that occurs throughout November and December -- several family members had birthdays and of course there is Christmas ( sometimes lamely called `` The Holidays '' as if these were the only holidays over the course of a year ) .	1
Scotch tape works just as it should and the 3-pack is a good deal especially for all the wrapping that needs done in the Christmas season . : )	1
Love this tape . It definitely disappears when wrapping two sheets of paper which makes it great for professional looking wrapped packages ! I would call this a re-purchase !	1
Scotch gift wrap tape is my new preferred tape for wrapping gifts ( have to get started on that early so that it does n't put me in the poor house ) . For years I saw this on shelves and scoffed , thanks to the fact that it was more expensive , but after actually using the stuff , I can almost see why it costs more . It is much less noticeable than the invisible ( matte and not entirely transparent ) and transparent ( see-through , but very glossy ) tapes that I 've used for year . You can still tell it 's there , but you have to look a bit harder for it instead of it being a noticeable eyesore ( either because of glare from the transparent tape or the obvious washed-out and discolored effect of the invisible ) . Other than that , it 's still basically just tape , but it gets the job done and wo n't get in the way of your wrapping paper.If there 's one complaint , and I only have this one , it 's that there really is n't very much of it on a roll . I 've bought plenty of tape before during the holiday season , and I do n't think I 've ever had a roll run out so fast . The single roll of the gift wrap tape apparently has much more on it that the three rolls here do combined . That 's some pretty wasteful packaging 3M ( how very not `` green '' of you ) , so it costs you a star .	1
Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape . It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled , even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure , which I find to be a good thing . Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow , the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle . But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling .	1
I 've tried several ways to hide tape while wrapping packages , to include making those little tape loops , using double-sided tape , and `` frosty on the roll , invisible on the job '' tape . This tape really does a great job and hardly shows at all . The dispensers are n't really different from others ; it 's the tape itself that makes it different . It 's priced right and is here just in time for the gift-wrapping season .	1
I hope you 're not looking for a multi-thousand-word review on this one . : - ) It 's tape , after all . But this brand has worked well on everything I 've thrown at it . It sticks wrapping paper well , essentially disappearing into the paper once stuck . But it also sticks stuff to walls well , and in my experience does n't bring up the paint or leave behind a stick residue when you pull it off . Good produce that does EXACTLY what it 's meant to do !	1
For comparison purposes , I posted a photograph comparing Scotch Gift Wrap Tape , their cellophane tape ( shiny ) and their Magic Tape . The photo contains a sample of the three styles of tape applied to three different styles of gift wrap -- red foil , brown packing paper ( for those wrapping with a less processed product , ) and a patterned ( non-foil ) gift wrap.Perhaps not surprising , the shiny Scotch tape looks best on the foil but the Gift Wrap tape is a better choice for both the brown packing paper and patterned non-foil gift wrap . The Magic Tape had the most unattractive appearance on all three products.The Gift Wrap tape is very sturdy , so sturdy that sometimes it is reluctant to tear across the serrated edge of the plastic dispenser . Rolls inserted into a weighted dispenser would resolve that issue . That issue aside , I will definitely be buying more of this tape and using it for wrapping on all but foil paper , where I will continue to use the shiny tape .	1
This strong , durable tape will be put to great use during the holiday season ! This easy to use , long lasting product will be a staple in our household for years to come !	1
This is easily the best gift wrapping tape I have ever used . It is transparent , of course , but not shiny , like some competing brands I have used . UnlikeScotch Magic ( TM ) Tape 810-3PK , 3/4-inch x 1296 Inches , 3-Pack ( which is also fantastic ) , this tape does n't look cloudy on top of wrapping paper ; it really is just hard to see . The adhesive is strong enough to hold gift wrap together , but is also forgiving enough to allow you to peel it off and readjust if need to . All in all , this is a great product .	1
Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is the one and only tape to use on gift wrapping . The tape is smooth , disappears almost completely and keeps hold very well . At some angles , of course , the light will reflect and make the tape visible , but generally speaking this is the preferred tape . The smoothness of the tape cuts down on glare and reflections . It 's certainly great for other applications as well , but can not be beaten for sealing up your next gift .	1
It 's been a few decades since Scotch delighted us with Magic Tape , replacing the shiny , brittle Scotch tape of the 1970s with a matte , nearly invisible tape that did n't mar a nicely wrapped gift . Now , there is a specialized GiftWrap tape , which `` features a unique satin finish that disappears on most gift wrap papers '' , according to Scotch . GiftWrap tape is a little stronger than Magic Tape and harder to tear . Its finish does n't have the dulling effect of the very-matte Magic Tape , but it is more reflective , which can be an issue in oblique light.I compared GiftWrap tape to Magic Tape on 6 different wrapping papers in a variety of lighting conditions . The papers were : gold metallic , silver patterned metallic , red , a bright print , a pastel print , and plain white paper . Magic Tape has always looked bad on metallics due to its matte texture that contrasts with the shiny paper . GiftWrap tape does much better . It can be noticeable in oblique light , but it is still a lot better than the Magic Tape on metallic papers . I observed much the same result on dark-colored papers.Light colors and prints produced varied results , however . The lighter the color , the greater the edge to the matte Magic Tape . The more reflective surface of the GiftWrap tape makes it more noticeable , especially if the light strikes your package from the side . On white paper , the Magic Tape is consistently less conspicuous than the GiftWrap tape . On the pastel print , Magic Tape is generally preferable . The brighter or darker the paper , the greater advantage to the more transparent GiftWrap tape over the dulling matte finish of Magic Tape.So there you have it . If you use a lot of metallic papers , get some GiftWrap tape . You 'll love the result . It also looks better on red paper , bright or dark prints , and probably -though I did n't try it- on bright blue paper such as one might like for Hanukkah . If you use a lot of pastels or light prints , or your tastes in gift wrap are eclectic , you may not want to abandon your Magic Tape just yet . Keep both GiftWrap Tape and Magic Tape on hand . The GiftWrap tape is available in packages of 3 rolls , 300 inches each . The tape is 3/4 inch wide , same as the Magic Tape .	1
Works great for gift wrapping . I buy a 3 pack every year to wrap Christmas and birthday presents . Will buy again and would recommend to a friend !	1
Tis the season to wrap presents so I put this tape to good use . On first glance , you think this is going to be shiny like the cheap stuff . It 's a little tougher than the the gift wrap tape of yesteryear so you think this is going to be just like the cheap stuff . It 's not . The gift wrap tape I used in the past was easy to tear and flimsy . I stuck some in the wrong spot and was able to easily lift if off the paper without tearing the paper . It 's a little harder to tear off the dispenser and I would have liked a sharper edge , but I did n't get any wadded tape to throw away . Best of all , when the package was wrapped , the tape really disappeared . I did n't rub it down with my thumbnail or anything . Just poof , ca n't see the tape . Even nicer , because it came in a three pack , two of us could be wrapping at the same time and not fight over the tape .	1
We used this tape when wrapping Christmas gifts this year and I was really impressed with it . On the foil wraps it showed a little , but any type of type shows up well on foil wrap . On regular decorated wrap it blended so well you could hardly see it . Would definitely buy it again .	1
Scotch `` Magic '' tape has long been a staple in our kitchen `` junk drawer '' and we 're addicted to it for wrapping gifts , sticking up notes , etc . This new gift wrap version seems to hold even better than our old standby and pretty much disappears on any matte finish gift wrap . However , it will definitely show up if you 're using foil paper or any other paper that 's shiny .	1
This tape does exactly what it 's supposed to do ! It 's virtually invisible on wrapping paper and holds everything in place .	1
Now , I have used this Scotch tape before but I do n't know if they have changed it or what - This tape is STICKY ! Almost too sticky , if possible . I have started wrapping Christmas presents already and while doing so with this tape , there were several times where the tape would kind of get wrapped around my fingertip/fingernail or otherwise stuck to my fingernail and it was kind of a challenge to get it off . It posed a little difficulty in wrapping , but on the other hand , it is a good quality to have in a tape obviously . It blends in pretty well with the wrapping paper , but is n't as transparent as others I have used . All in all I do give it 5 stars because it is heavy tape..a little thicker than I remebered from previous use and of course it is very sticky which means it will hold whatever you need to stick together or tape down . I actually used a whole roll of this on packaging up small boxes for shipping as well as bubble mailers . Good stuff !	1
I have always HATED `` invisible '' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you 're trying to get it off the roll . But transparent tape does n't always look good on wrapping paper ... This is the first time that I 've tried `` gift wrap tape , '' and I LOVE it ! Looks great , but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape . It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer ! The only thing I 'd change is ... put more on each roll ! : - )	1
It works just like all other tape products from Scotch ... ..wonderfully . It 's tape . What 'd you expect ? ! ?	1
This tape is a bit more transparent and smooth looking than the regular Scotch transparent tape . Just as useful in my estimation .	1
One thing you can be sure of when purchasing a Scotch/3M brand item : They know adhesives . This tape is great.I just used this tape to repair a pair of `` toddler-handled '' pop-up books , and the tape seems very sturdy , directly comparable toScotch Magic ( TM ) Tape 3105 , 3/4-inch x 300 Inches , 3-Packbut with a clearer finish.I was wondering what the `` Satin Finish '' would be like , and I think I 'm going to like it . A lot . Allow me to try to explain why the `` Satin Finish is so neat . It 's not altogether clear when on the roll , but when you stick it to paper , it almost completely disappears . Why is this a good thing ? It has the substance and feel ofScotch Magic ( TM ) Tape 3105 , 3/4-inch x 300 Inches , 3-Pack ( the opaque stuff with the green label ) , which I 've always found superior to other more typical gift wrap tapes that are crystal clear , from a manageability standpoint . ( The crystal clear tapes always seem fussy and flimsy . ) When applied , the `` Satin Finish '' gives you a nearly ( but not quite ) crystal clear finish . It 's the best of both worlds.Additional details : This tape comes off the roll easily , is not excessively sticky on the fingers ( again , making for easy application to paper ) , and cuts consistently on the dispenser 's built-in `` teeth '' .All in all , Scotch/3M products belong to trustworthy brands that consistently produce excellent product . This gift wrap tape keeps the streak alive .	1
Well , you may have to rub the tape a bit with your fingernail , but it DOES pretty much disappear on the wrapping paper I 've used it on . Whether or not you do , the tape is too sticky to peel off without taking off the surface of the paper too , so there you have it !	1
The first time I purchased Scotch Gift Wrap Tape was three years ago at Christmastime . I saw it in the drugstore , thought it looked interesting , and decided to treat myself to something new/different . I immediately became a big fan of it : it blended perfectly with my wrapping paper , virtually disappearing . I was impressed with how nice it looked . And , like regular Scotch tape , it was very strong and very easy to work with.Nowadays , this is the only Scotch tape I buy . It 's perfect for everything : home , office , crafts , and of course gift wrapping . The price is the same as the other types of Scotch type . It works just as well , if not better . And it 's made in the U.S.A. What more could you ask for ? This is one of those simple , elegant , no-frills products that gets the job done , and done right , every time . Give it a try , you 'll love it .	1
`` Invisible '' is pretty typical of tape marketing , and I think consumers have come to expect some degree of transparency from tape , but we 're still far from the disappearing act suggested by Scotch and other tape brands . That being said , this tape comes as close as I think we can reasonably expect . It 's specifically intended for gift wrap , and the `` satin '' finish matches very closely to the finish on most of my wrapping papers , making it much less jarring and obvious when the present is all taped up and ready to go . As most Scotch brand tapes are , this tape is very sturdy and does n't tear vertically like some of the cheaper tapes . It feels thick and it 's very satisfying to use.The only thing I do n't really like about the tape is the dispenser . It 's a standard size , but it feels too small for the thickness of the tape and it was very easy to accidentally pop the tape roll out of the roller . It was also easy to get back in , but I 'm not going to refill this dispenser so I 'd prefer if the roll stayed put.All in all a good , dependable product and a welcome addition to the present-wrapping box .	1
I have to wrap a ton of gifts throughout the year and I love this gift wrap tape - it is thicker and attaches more smoothly than regular tape . I bought this on sale and feel happy to be able to use it once in a while . Highly recommended !	1
This is the tape I use for all my giftwrapping . It has a matte sheen to it , which means it blends in very well against wrapping paper . `` Traditional '' scotch tape has a shine to it , and I 've always thought that was just a little unattractive . When you hand a present to someone , particularly one you 've taken time to wrap with nice paper , bow , etc ... do you really want the light catching your tape and drawing all attention to that . This gift wrap tape avoids that problem.Also , over the years , I 've tried various `` generic '' tape ... and it all has been uniformly bad . This is one area where I no longer skimp . At Christmas time , I want tape that looks good , is easy to tear off the roll ( why is Scotch the only company that makes dispensers that actually tear off the tape on the little teeth in front of the dispenser , rather than grabbing and pulling and mangling it ? ) , and if I loose the end and it reattaches to the roll , it is very easy to get it started again.Tape is a little thing ... but if you wrap a lot of presents , as I do during the holidays ... it is indispensible . A modest product , but one that delivers near perfection for the task you need it to do . ( PS : In my opinion , because it costs a little more than conventional scotch tape , it is not really best for business purposes . I really only use this for wrapping , and I save the shiny stuff for more everyday , mundane uses . )	1
What can one write about tape ? On the surface tape has one quality that we care about the most -- does it stick ? You can then elaborate on that by asking a series of other questions such as how hard is it to remove ? Does it leave any marks on the surface ? Is it clear or does it show ? What material will it stick to ? Etc , etc.For the purposes of this tape the question is -- does it wrap gifts up , keep them wrapped and not show or at least is barely visible ? After all , who wants to give someone a gift that looks like its being held together with duct tape ? The good news is for both questions the answer turns out to be YES ! Yes , it does keep the wrapping paper where it belongs -- on the gift . Yes , it does n't show -- or at least it fades into the background on most packaging paper.What can I say ? I 'm stuck on this product , and that is a good thing .	1
This tape really does look nicer for wrapping gifts . I used wrapping paper that has a black background with regular scotch tape . When the gift wrap tape arrived , I compared it by adding a piece next to the regular tape . The gift tape is nearly invisible , whereas the other is cloudier and more apparent . I asked the other members of the household and everyone agrees the gift tape looks so much better .	1
First off -- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear , this is the right product for you . On that , 5 stars . On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each -- a 3 star . It 's a better deal and more than the standard `` green '' Scotch tape 3 pack , and the price is lower , but still , you 'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls . If you need multiple dispensers and do n't use it much , this is a decent purchase . If you do n't need tape at multiple locations , I would n't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll , less packaging , etc .	1
Always need extra tape around the holidays . Picked this up when ordering some other stuff . You know what you are getting .	1
This tape is invisible on gift wrap paper . Exactly what I was looking for and glad that Scotch developed this product .	1
I was happy to review Scotch Gift Wrap Tape considering the time of year . Yes , I already have Christmas presents that needed wrapping , so I was set to go . The tape was easily dispensed ; I had no trouble getting whatever size I needed . It went on easily and did not leave that 'tape look ' on the wrapping paper . It definitely disappeared nicely . There was not a lot of tape on each roll so you may want to save this tape for special presents . It might not be appreciated used on a child 's present since they rarely take the time to notice the beauty of the wrap . However , for a present that you want to wrap special , this is the tape to use . The product did what it said it would , and really that is what is important .	1
This is a continuous roll of very thin plastic , and one side of it is tacky ( sticky ) . The roll is housed in a hard plastic container , which has a serrated cutting device at one end . What you do is pull on the strip of thin plastic , and when a sufficient amount has been exposed , you sever the plastic strip from the rest of the roll by using the aforementioned serrated cutting device . I know it sounds confusing , but once you do it 3 or 4 times , you 'll get the hang of it . Truly remarkable new invention .	1
The Scotch Gift Wrap Tape lives up to its claim of being super sticky and transparent , and is a great option to use as a tape for wrapping gifts . The tape has the standard Scotch easy start tab at the beginning of the roll , so it is easy to get the tape started . And the tape blends beautifully with the gift wrap or any type of paper you are taping . It is very hard to see the tape on the paper -- a great feature if you do n't want regular translucent tape on showing on your package . And the tape is super sticky . In fact , once the tape is on the wrap , do not try to reposition it -- it will tear the wrap -- so make sure you have it where you want it when you put it in place . A great tape for any type of sealing , but especially good on gift wrap , school projects , or any other projects where you do not want to see tape seams . Oh , and it is made in the USA for anyone looking for domestically made products . Highly recommended !	1
The tape has a nice satin finish so looks great on packages and blends in nicely . It dispenses easily and is convenient to apply . The extra width helps hold package ends that sometimes need more tape to keep it in place . When on a package , the tape is practically invisible and looks better than glossy clear tape .	1
Once I tried this brand tape I have never bought anything but this kind since ! I love how it goes on with a silky completely non-glare finish . The tape is strong and It does n't seem to curl up on itself as much as other kinds do . It holds extremely well and in my opinion looks so much nicer than the shiney tape does . I really think if you try it you 'll be hooked-or rather , stuck on it !	1
It 's hard to get excited by tape . As long as it unrolls , tears well and sticks , it 's as good as it needs to be . I liked the finish , which is n't annoyingly shiny and doens't call attention to itself . Recommended .	1
I 've tried saving money and buying off-brand or store-brand wrapping tape . If you 've ever been frustrated with tape that does n't tear properly , or that dispenses erratically , you know what I mean . The price of this Scotch wrapping tape is n't much more than the bargain brands , so why buy something inferior that will perform poorly and look unprofessional ? This is the tape to buy for the holidays . Cuts smoothly , nearly invisible , and makes presents look good . Ca n't find any reason not to give this product the five stars it deserves .	1
Its holds wrapping paper in place extremely well . It is very transparent , but no shiny . Once one tapes a seam or something else , the tape can be carefully lifted and repositioned without difficulty . Wrapping presents ? Crafting ? This is your tape . Those folks at Scotch know their tape .	1
The title pretty much sums it up . It 's Scotch brand , the best . I have used this before and it works great . The old-fashioned tape dispensers work the best . I bought a Scotch mini roller type you hold with your hand and it has some problems ... mostly meant for flat surfaces and the cutter does n't work well after awhile , so back to the old-fashioned for me !	1
The Scotch Gift Wrap Tape lives up to its claim of being super sticky and transparent , and is a great option to use as a tape for wrapping gifts . The tape has the standard Scotch easy start tab at the beginning of the roll , so it is easy to get the tape started . And the tape blends beautifully with the gift wrap or any type of paper you are taping . It is very hard to see the tape on the paper -- a great feature if you do n't want regular translucent tape on showing on your package . And the tape is super sticky .

A great tape for any type of sealing , but especially good on gift wrap , school projects , or any other projects where you do not want to see tape seams . Oh , and it is made in the USA for anyone looking for domestically made products . Highly recommended !	1
I did not look at the length too closely , but it 's not as long as the one I bought in the store . That having been said , it 's great tape and I would buy again !	1
Not much to be said , other than it 's nice good tape ... The flat finish is unobtrusive on wrapping papers , and the 3/4 inch width is generous enough to cover misalignments when wrestling with paper edges . I do not , however , see much difference between this Scotch tape , and the traditional Scotch `` magic '' tape in the green package .	1
It is difficult for me to get too excited about gift wrapping tape -- probably because my wife does all the gift wrapping ( unlike me , she is really good at it ) , and also because when I get a wrapped gift the last thing I look at it is to see what kind of tape was used . However , if you are looking for unobtrusive tape that is easy to use , then this product does work . Not much more to really say about it .	1
What can I say ? Excellent tape , almost invisible . Dispenser works well . Nothing new , no surprises .	1
There might be some who would claim that any old tape will do . However , when it comes to wrapping , it 's worth the extra few cents and time to make sure you have Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.When you care enough to purchase a gift , find a box , the perfect wrap and bow , you do not want a little thing distracting from your hard work and thoughtfulness . It could be easy to overlook , but traditional Scotch Tape for office use , when used on gift wrap , stands out and not in a good way.Gift Wrap tape from Scotch is different . When applied and pushed down firmly , the tape blends into the wrap dramatically better . It 's truly a night and day difference . Some might argue one can press the professional wrapping look even more by using double stick tape , to completely hide any sign of tape . However , this is not always particle , nor easy , and even more difficult to find available.Scotch is great with the packaging too . The tape cuts easy with the built in dispenser , unlike some of the bargain basement generic brands , which simply stretch as you try to cut a piece of the tape.Overall , Scotch offers that little something extra you need when wrapping gifts , Scotch Gift Wrap Tape . Indeed , I simply make it my primary office tape , so that I always have it on hand . After all , it works great for your generic office needs too . A quality product .	1
My standards were n't too high on this order . I wanted a role of tape , sticky on one side , smooth on the other . It is delightfully transparent . Apparently , it 's ideal for gift wrapping , but inasmuch as wrapping paper and I are sworn enemies , I doubt the quality of my tape will be the first thought in my family 's heads . If you like tape , you 'll find this entirely sufficient !	1
Scotch gift wrapping tape is wonderful . It 's 3/4 of an inch wide , and goes on clear so you really can barely see it on the wrapping paper . Three rolls of tape goes a long ways . We used it for a recent birthday present and it looked great . Now I am on with the gift wrapping for the holidays . Thanks for the free samples . I love this tape !	1
Scotch tape is one of my brand preference items . The tape adheres well , is virtually invisible and is easy to use . Great tape for most any paper related job .	1
When it comes to tape , there 's nothing else like the Scotch-brand . Unlike other less-familiar brands , Scotch is dependable . This 3-pack of GiftWrap tape provides what Scotch-brand users have come to depend upon - a dispenser that dispenses a tape with a satin finish that will virtually disappear when you use it on most gift wrap . It dispenses easily , tears off without a hitch , and sticks securely , no questions asked . You do n't have to worry about whether it 's going to stick or not . This 3/4 inch 3-roll pack is perfect to have on-hand for Christmas .	1
This tape does exactly what it claims to do ... your presents will look impressive ... with no signs of the tape . I would definitely buy this again .	1
Yes , this tape does look great when wrapping presents . Yes , it disappears on gift wrapped surfaces . But that 's not all . I use it for my `` everyday '' tape as well - great for small repairs when you need the tape to not leave a strange matte spot on the surface like `` regular '' tape . Did your kids rip yet ANOTHER page in their storybook ? Scotch BiftWrap tape . Did you forget to put something in that pretty mailing envelope ? Carefully unseal it , and then ... Scotch GiftWrap tape . Crafts , scrapbooking , kids ' projects ? Scotch GiftWrap tape . I only wish that more tape came on the rolls .	1
Tape is a modern convenience we take for granted . When wrapping gifts , though , there 's nothing more frustrating than not having decent tape on-hand . This tape works well for wrapping gifts -- it 's primary purpose . It also can be used for other things , as well.The tape out-of-the-package has a good tab-leader to get you started . The holder is entirely plastic , including the blade , so it 'll be difficult to injure yourself cutting the tape . The cutter cuts cleanly-enough for wrapping gifts . The edges of the tape will have a `` tooth '' pattern , but they apply smoothly to paper and are n't noticeable at all.This is the `` satin finish '' tape that disappears almost entirely when applied . If you gently apply it to paper or giftwrap , it will have a slightly-opaque appearance . If , however , you rub against it with your finger or fingernail and apply significant pressure , it will virtually disappear against the paper . This makes gift-wrapping and other projects very neat in appearance.The tape removes somewhat easily , depending on the paper surface . It will remove from glossy surfaces without lifting the ink , but when it comes to gift-wrap , it will remove the top layer of most papers . If you press firmly , it 's even more difficult to remove.The roll of tape is 300 inches in length -- that 's 25 feet . That might seem like a lot , but most people will need more for extensive holiday wrapping . Keep the length in mind.Recommended for gift-wrapping and general purpose projects .	1
I dislike wrapping Christmas gifts . I am horrible at it and if the present does n't come out with a big ball of paper around it , then it is a major triumph of my soul . This tape is thick enough to help me calm my wrapping paper beast . And it holds down velvet ribbon when I do n't have enough of it to go all the way around the box and have to tape it piecemeal around the bottom . It 's invisible and matte , so it makes my oddball wrapping look put together . A wonderful thing . Five stars .	1
For gift wrapping & other instances where you 'd like tape to not be so visible , this stuff is great ! I 've actually used it on wooden picture frames & wooden press board furniture that had dents in it to just help maintain integrity . There 's probably a better fix , but it works for me . Scotch knows how to make tape & this tape is no exception .	1
This tape has a nice finish on it . It feels nice to the touch . I would n't keep it around for fixing things , as it is n't the strongest adhesive , but it is nicer than less expensive tapes when you use it on gifts . In other words , it 's perfectly suitable for its intended purpose .	1
The Scotch company has become so well associated with cellophane tape that it 's hard not to use the term `` Scotch tape '' to refer to cellophane tape in general . This gift wrap tape is similar to their standard satin finished tape and is designed to blend into the wrapping paper . It does so quite well and looks good on a variety of surfaces . It will not disappear completely on all surfaces , and on some surfaces it can show tiny pore marks depending on the quality of the paper , but if you smooth things down enough , it should not be a problem . In any event , it works as well or better than other tapes on the market.A problem I have with gift wrap tape is that I will inevitably get a piece of tape with a wrinkle in it because I positioned it wrong . An ideal tape would be re-positionable , and Scotch never makes that claim for this product . Nevertheless , I was able to reposition it when used on glossy finished printed boxes as well as on higher quality wrapping paper . I was pleasantly surprised , but it still took the ink off an envelope and left it with a rough surface when I tried to pull it off carefully.Although it is not the pinnacle of what I would wish for in a gift wrap tape , it 's the best choice on the market for the purpose . If you already have an ample supply of Scotch satin finish general purpose tape , I see no reason for you to get this product instead . If you do get this product , there will be no problem using it as a general purpose tape if you do n't want to save it for future wrapping needs . The rolls of tape do not contain an incredible amount , and the tape could have fit in two cases or one larger case instead of three . Yet it may still be an ample supply for a holiday season depending on your needs.If you do n't already have an ample supply of Scotch satin tape , this product is a good choice . But there is not enough of an advantage that you should rule out the other Scotch tape if you get a good price . But do n't skimp on an off brand shiny tape . Considering the few inches you use per package , it 's worth the money to get the right tape for the job .	1
It 's tape . I bought it to wrap Xmas presents . It sufficiently adheres to things . Not much else to say here !	1
The scotch gift wrap tape works very well . It sticks to the wrapping paper nicely and it 's super easy to get off the roll . It rips cleanly and easily . It has the easy start tab on it which makes getting the roll started a bit easier than some rolls of tape . I really do n't know what else to say about it ... .it 's tape , it sticks and does what it is supposed to do .	1
3M is a company that makes high quality products ; although , rarely a cutting edge innovator . A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those . 3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on . This product might be marginally less opaque , but only marginally.3M 's genius is in its marketing of its products . So , while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes , its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation . One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied . Alas , no such thing : The stuff is still plainly right there if not , perhaps , as plain as day.So , while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I do n't think it is anything to shout about.Still , another excellent product from 3M .	1
My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School . The last time we went to a B & M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled , which is n't accepted in her school . I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $ 1 , so I picked up the limit of three . They are now on the list of items I will order regularly , easy enough to add to any order I 'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging .	1
For me , I prefer the college ruled notebooks and paper because it just plain holds more info and the notebook last longer . This Mead is top notch quality that I use in different colors and write with different pens and pencils . The paper is of excellent quality so that whatever pen or pencil I choose , the page is highly readable with no smears.This notebook is suitable for any age from young students to senior adults . And I have found these notebooks I keep records in and love to use them next to my computer when I take notes from my computer research.This is a must have spiral notebook as in my opinion , Mead is the BEST ONE !	1
Okay , there are some pretty basic reasons I use these particular notebooks . First and most importantly , they are cheap ! I go through dozens upon dozens of these things a year , to the extent that cost does matter . I use them for everything ... more about that later . Secondly , they are college ruled . I have a real hang up about that and have almost a phobia about using the wider ruled note books . Thirdly , the quality of the paper is what I want ... it holds ink pretty well , are better than some about ink bleeding through , but most importantly , it holds simple old graphite from my pencils . The white color of the pages makes my feeble attempts at penmanship readable and does not stress my eyes in the bright sun light . For me , these notebooks are simply work horses.Now if I were setting on the Board of Directors of a Fortune 500 company , I probably would not use these things during meetings ( well , actually I would , cause I am me , but most people would not ) , but as I do not hold such a dubiously exalted position , and it is a pretty good bet that I never will , I need not worry about appearances in that particular setting.I do use these things for everything else though . As I read , I take notes . I am a list maker and manically and obsessively create list of just about anything you can imagine . I have lists dating back for well over 60 years , many of which I have no clue as to what I was listing or why , but never-the-less , I have my precious lists . These books are ideal for making shopping lists , chore lists , things to do lists and more . Having different colors is a big advantage when you are a multiple list maker like me as it helps to organize things a bit . I also use these to `` write things down '' as I have problems with my memory at times . I wish I could say that this was because I am getting a bit long in the tooth , but that would be a lie . I have been forgetting things since I was a wee lad and learned a long time ago that it is best to write things down . I have boxes and trunks filled with old notebooks of things I was an am suppose to remember ... never look at most of them of course , but they are there if I need them ! I am also an obsessive drawer and these are ideal for making rough sketches and strange designs.I like these thinner 70 page models over the thicker three or more subject ones as I tend to lose many of these notebooks and it is nicer to lose a few pages versus many pages.I must have hundreds of these things filled from cover to cover from my school days . My children will no doubt have a wonderful burning one of these days.Are these books a pure class act ? Hardly , but they are cheap , serviceable , easy to find and extremely functional . It has been years since I felt the need to impress anyone with my writing materials ( actually , that is a lie also , due to the fact that to the best of my knowledge , I have never felt this need to impress anyone as to the aspect of my life ) , and I seriously doubt if I will change my way as I have gotten worse about such things over the years.This is a very good buy here on Amazon and it is good to throw a few of these things with your order so you can hit the no shipping fee zone.I highly recommend this serviceable product.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
This purchase is such a no brainer . Note that Amazon only lets you buy one with each order , but it can help you make the $ 25 free shipping threshold . At present , these are going for 48 cents versus the 51 cents I paid . You can not purchase these in the grocery store for that price , which is where I usually get them . I go through these notebooks regularly , using them for shopping lists and planning events . Okay , I 'm getting to the point that at times I have to write things down because I ca n't remember them otherwise . You say , why not post its ? Yes , I use those too , but occasionally the project is much more than a post it can handle . For instance , when I go away for one or two weeks , there are a number of things I have to remember to do during the seven days before I leave . So , I dedicate a page for each day and write down the things that have to be done . Similarly , Thanksgiving is coming up . For the two weeks prior , I have a ton of things that need to be done before T Day , and then each day I check off the things as they are completed . Never mind Christmas . You get the idea . I do n't care about whether there is a particular quality to the paper or whether the perforation is perfect . The pages are torn out as tasks are completed . And yes , I have even given them to my grandkids for their school projects , with no complaints .	1
Our main laser printer uses these cartridges and they never get the claimed 6500 pages , but that is not an issue , that is expected ! The issue is that the printer still says the cartridge is good when it is depositing a grey background on everything you print !	1
I bought my HL-1870N printer which came with one of these TN-560 cartridges , and I got 6200 pages out of it according to the network administration function . It tooks several years . I had bought a spare toner cartridge in anticipation with the printer , and it sat on a shelf for years . I fully expect it to last another couple of years .	1
A technician at a Tucson Brother authorized repair shop volunteered that & # 34 ; Brother Overengineers Their Printers & # 34 ; in response to my comments about my long term satisfaction with my Brother laser printer that I had brought in for some rare service . I 've been totally satisfied with my old reliable Brother printer and I 've never tried to save a few shekels by using toner or related products that were n't Brother products . Why should I risk disappointment when Brother has never let me down .	1
The Brother laser printer has served me well since 1991 . When print quality indicates , I buy a new toner cartridge and receive the effect of a new printer . Installation is as easy as adding paper , and the genuine Brother cartridge fits and functions perfectly .	1
i AM LAZY AND IT WAS CHEAPER ONLINE SO I TOTALLY THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO BUY TAPE HERE .	1
This Matte Finish `` Magic '' Tape is so much better than the generic types for most uses . It goes on totally clear on most paper , it is very strong , and the matte finish does n't easily reflect light so it does n't draw attention to itself.The brand name `` Scotch '' has become a `` proprietary eponym '' for this type of clear tape , along the same lines as Band-Aid , Kleenex , and Saran wrap for their respective products . This generally happens only when a product is the best of its kind and has become the de-facto standard . This is certainly the case for Scotch Tape.It may cost a little more , but it generally worth it . Highly Recommended !	1
This has been my favorite tape for years ... which is why we probably call & # 34 ; tape & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; scotch tape & # 34 ; ! It simply is better then the others in my opinion . It feels better , it does n't yellow , it is very easy to wrap presents with , it is almost invisible , you can write on it , and probably thousands of other things.Does it cost a few cents more ? Maybe , but it is the quality you are paying for . : ) Plus , I am use use to saying & # 34 ; can You tell me where the scotch tape is please & # 34 ; ?	1
This tape comes in handy when Christmas Day is only a few weeks away . It does the job in keeping gift wrapping intact , or even placing notes on the wall . It is not difficult to remove the tape from the dispenser , so it is easy to use . The tape is not one-hundred percent see through , since the matte finish makes it looks glossy . The stickiness of the tape is excellent , which makes the product a reliable one in most circumstances , such as a school project .	1
Scotch Magic Tape is the only kind of tape I buy . I have used cheaper tapes . They pale in comparison . Magic tape is virtually invisible when applied . It is sturdy yet able to be sliced with a fingernail when you need to adjust the length of the tape on the fly . Cheap tapes just twist and crumple . No frustration with Magic tape . Did I mention that it is the only kind of tape I buy ? !	1
What can I say ? It 's Scotch tape ... and just what you expect from Scotch tape . Good quality , good price , glad I bought it !	1
What can I say - it 's Scotch tape ! It does what it 's supposed to . It arrived brand new in the package .	1
I bought this tape because there 's a upcomingbirthday for friend 's daughter . I was nervous , I can not wrap her birthday gift without tape ! I could n't sleep.T . M .	1
Too THIN ! ! Much too thin and not long lasting either.if your going to make tape thin then atleast make it long enough to last.Not the case here , it ran out too fast.buy something that has more length to it.but sense i do like scotch i give them a 4 .	1
For only about 2 bucks this saves you a trip to the store and some gas . It looks great and it blends in so it looks invisible .	1
I 've been using Scotch Magic Tape since I was a kid . I think it came out during the early 1960 's , maybe late 1950 's . We always had the Scotch Tape in the red package before this one came out and then it 's been the green one for me ever since . Gee , I guess I 've been using this tape for around 50 years . I guess that makes me 3M brand loyal.I was running low on tape and was so happy to find this tape as an Amazon add on item when a little short of $ 25 for free shipping . It was nice to have a reminder that Amazon carries these little office products I 'm always needing around my home .	1
I ca n't believe I already need to start thinking about back-to-school supplies ... . A 200 pack of wide ruled paper is always somewhere on that list . And , since Mead has some of the best , most reliable products on the market , I 'm glad I could start here .	1
I used to only buy Mead paper when I was in high school and college , there was no doubt that it was a thicker paper than most others . These days I really do n't see much of a difference between Mead and generic store brands other than the price . This paper will definitely do the job you need it to do but so will some other cheaper brands ( currently it is $ 2.99 on Amazon ) .	1
Many moons ago when I was in school I only used Mead filler paper because it was well made , sturdy and fit easily into my binders . Now that my son is in school I 've noticed that the paper seems a little thinner than I remember , however it meets the basic needs of my soon to be first grader . The huge plus for me is that this product is made in the USA and I will definitely continue to purchase it for my children .	1
This is 200 sheets of wide rules filler paper , It has three holes punched for your binder . The lines do n't fade or smudge as some lesser filler papers are prone to do . It is crisp , clean , white , smudgeproof , and looks and performs like the best papers in the world , at a reasonable price . I like to get 200 sheets in a package as this is a generous size but not so much that I have to store a lot of excess paper on a shelf where it can get dusty . Mead makes great office supplies from the ones I 've been seeing lately .	1
I needed this for my daughter , for school work . The paper is pretty good & # 8211 ; it & # 8217 ; s not the really thick paper I remember from my own youth , which was so course that I could actually see the pulp fibers in it with the naked eye ! Its thinness reminds me more of the paper I used in college ( in the Stone Age , before everyone had a computer ) .I don & # 8217 ; t think that the paper is unusually thin . It seems to me to be good , normal , wide ruled paper . We are already using it for some work and we are happy enough with it . ( Review of Mead Filler Paper , Wide Ruled )	1
Come on , paper is paper and ruled refills are rule refills.True , but there is a bit more to it.It all depends on how you like to write . I personally like to write with a fountain pen . ( I know , anachronistic ) thus , I need paper that will not let the fountain pen ink , that is liquid instead of a gel like ball points or gel pens , seep through the paper.I 'm glad to say that this is a solid paper , that holds the ink and has proper texture.I recommend it without reservations .	1
This is good , basic school paper . It is perhaps not the thickest paper out there so if you are looking for something thicker , you might need to look elsewhere . Still it is fairly standard paper . The price seems to change quite often for the product , ranging from a great to poor price to definitely keep an eye on that . I am sending this paper with my daughter for her school .	1
This is paper . It is made from trees which are turned to pulp and then turned into this nice , wide lined , not scratchy smooth paper . I 'm a bigger fan of narrow ruled paper . My kid likes college ruled paper , but the wide lines are better for those who have to write a one page , hand written report when they do n't have a lot to say .	1
I 've been using Mead lined paper all my life . Unless the lines are off , this is a reliable product . The paper is the perfect size for binders and manila envelopes.The Amazon price is a bit steep , as I can get paper cheaper at big box stores in town . Keep this paper in a dry area , as the lines can run if the paper gets wet .	1
This Mead Filler Paper is fairly standard , if just a little thinner than higher quality notebook paper . This is a decent deal as an add on product with free shipping.Recommended for casual writing needs.CFH	1
Great quick delivery . Mead 200 filler paper for all your school needs and other paper needs . Paper is strong and easy to work with . Recommended product .	1
Mead seems to have good quality products in my experience . This is your standard 3 ring binder paper that is Wide Ruled . I like it to use for my 1rst grader 's homework , no ripping out of a notebook ( which is hard for them to do without making a mess ) . So great to have it shipped to my front door !	1
At the current price the paper is a good value . The paper might be a little thin but the printed lines were great , not to overpowering and no misses . More suited for pencils . Recommended .	1
I have been using Mead paper since I was a little boy and it has always done a great job . I just got a bunch of file folders that need paper so this came just at the right time . Perfectly ruled sheets that are waiting for my chicken scratch.Great price too . Thanks Mead for all of the years of great paper products !	1
Mead knows paper . This paper is perfect for school kids . Nice color and the lines are perfect . Fit nicely in a binder .	1
Be careful of paper dimensions .	1
I have read innumerable hardback novels since I was a child . Over the years , I & # 8217 ; ve noticed that the pages have become much thinner , almost as thin as newspaper . I recently took some of my old hardback novels , published from the 1970 & # 8217 ; s , out of storage and performed a comparison ; the pages of my old novels have yellowed but they are twice as thick as recently published hardback novels.Therefore , I wasn & # 8217 ; t too surprised when I unwrapped the package of 200 sheets of Mead Wide Ruled Filler Paper and discovered that the sheets were thin . The sheets were not as thin as newspaper , but they were noticeably thinner than when I was a high school student over thirty years ago . It & # 8217 ; s a sign of our hard economic times . Everything is getting thinner but me.All 200 sheets have been punched correctly and they fit well inside a one-inch notebook . The lines are wide and dark enough for me to see on both sides of each sheet . Most importantly , I am able to write on the sheets . I wrote notes while reading a novel for the purpose of creating a book review . Normally , I only order inexpensive office supplies from Amazon when I need to add something to my cart for the sole purpose of exceeding $ 35.00 and earning free shipping.Joseph B. Hoyos	1
I enjoy the wide rule , soft feel to this paper . It is as you would expect from Mead West products .	1
It 's notebook paper & # 8230 ; What 's to say . The package was intact , and the lines were clear . Not much else to describe .	1
This notebook paper is n't the best that I 've used . It 's still pretty nice though . It 's a little on the thin side but It fits nicely in a binder . The only advantage I can think of for this thin paper is that your notebook wo n't be so heavy ! I also wondered if the thickness of the paper meant that ink would go right though . I checked that with my runniest pen , which is a Pentel gel pen and am glad to say that the ink does not bleed through . The wide ruled paper is perfect for some children that write bigger . Other than that , the paper has no other flaws and works nicely as notebook paper .	1
This is standard wide ruled binder paper . It is heavy duty enough to be taken in and out of my binder . The wide rules make for easy note taking and organization . The white color is clean , but not too bright . This is fine for use in my new binder .	1
This is wide ruled paper and is easier for grades 1-3 to form their words on.There are 200 sheets of paper in a pack with drilled holes and fit perfectly in a 1 inch binder .	1
This is a basic pack of loose-leaf paper , nothing in it to overly wow or overly disappoint . Our paper has all the holes , margins , and lines in the appropriate places , and the lines were dark enough to be visible . ( We & # 8217 ; ve purchased cheaper paper where the lines were almost too faint to see . ) However , if you have a younger writer or someone who puts a lot of pressure on their pen/pencil while writing , this paper may be a bit on the thin side .	1
This is good paper and the price is very reasonable . Since I homeschool 2 elementary children , I needed the wide-ruled.My only complaint would be that I ca n't get a package that 's a ream and I really prefer 8 1/2 x 11 ( but ca n't find that anywhere so it 's not an Amazon issue ) .	1
It seems like paper is always in short supply around here . We need a quality paper and this seems to do the trick.This paper is thick enough and smooth so writing on it is effortless . On a side note it also makes excellent paper planes . Decent paper at a decent price . Recommended !	1
My grandchildren are always running out of loose leaf paper when doing their homework or projects so I tried this pack . Excellent . I can highly recommend it - and so do my grandchildren .	1
Perfect school supplies for my second grade student . We go through so much of this Wide- Ruled Loose Filler Paper each school year .	1
We buy a lot of paper each year . Mead provides a good basic ( cheap ) paper that will no doubt meet the needs of most students . However , I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day . It 's OK - nothing great - a good utilitarian option but for wide-ruled paper ( for younger students ) I think it really should n't be quite so thin.Pricing Note ( not part of the review ) : The price as I write this review is $ 1.33 for 200 sheets of wide-ruled filler paper . That is the delivered price if you are an Amazon Prime member or combine with other products to get Super Saver Shipping . If the price is higher as you read this review you may want to consider coming back at the start of the next school season and stocking when they are on sale .	1
There are n't many criteria upon which to rate ruled filler paper , but value can be assessed based on paper thickness and price . Though I know Mead as a brand name , and expected a higher price , this is actually one of the more economical packages of filler paper on the market . I compared it to several packages at Walmart and it is significantly cheaper per page than many and only slightly more expensive than a no-name brand.I flipped through the package to check the paper because some reviewers seem to have gotten bad batches with misaligned printing , cut pages , or other problems . All of the pages in mine were the same - the lines were properly printed and no pages were damaged except the very top one which took a hit ( an indentation ) from being sent in a padded mailer . Other than that , all of the sheets were fine.The paper is quite thin , though not so thin as to make it too translucent . It is exactly like I remember binder filler paper being when I was in high school ( a very , very long time ago ) . You can see the shadow of darker writing behind it , but it 's not too heavy . If you want paper that will last , then you may want to shop for something thicker . If you 're just looking to fill your kid 's notebook or something which you will use and eventually discard , this is pretty much what you want . It has the exact feel of the stuff I remember crumpling up and tossing across the room with the hopes of hitting a trash can ( and usually missing ) .	1
The quality of the appear is thin ... but for scribbling notes and jotting down pointers..it is great . We tried it as a print paper for your printer of those odd jobs where we are not seeking flashy jobs like a recipe page , or a music score for practice..it worked without being stuck in the printer.Not bad for value .	1
My six year old wants to graduate from the guided writing kinds of paper ( wide-ruled red and blue lines on newsprint ) to something & # 34 ; older & # 34 ; . Having this around keeps her out of my printer paper . Good buy !	1
I think it 's a little pricey for 200 sheets , but then again with Prime that includes `` free '' shipping . We use a ton of paper at our tutoring center , and I prefer the wide ruled for my students , especially the ones in elementary school . The wide ruled lines give the young writers more room to express themselves in words and numbers . For math activities I 'll sometimes turn the paper horizontal with the lines running up and down . This can help students visualize columns and be better able to list numbers one below the other.These sheets of paper have red margins on both sides for convenience of application . For those who look for it , the Mead filler paper has the certified sourcing imprimatur .	1
I 've been using Mead notebook paper since I was a kid in school . It 's a really good standby.Nowadays I really like to use it as stationery . I cut off the red lines , and then cut down by about five lines from the top to get a good-sized lined piece of paper that can be jazzed up with rubber stamps . Additionally , I also use it a backing paper with nice stationery , so that I do n't use more than one sheet of nice stationery for a letter -- I use the nice piece as the first page , and these cut to size for other sheets . Either way , it helps save money while creating lined stationery . ( Yes , I 'm someone who still writes letters ! ) Whichever use you 're getting it for -- stationery or school -- this basic pack is a generous size with 200 sheets .	1
This is traditional wide-ruled , three-hole paper . Exactly the quality you expect from Mead -- decent thickness with clear , crisp lines and edges -- and ideal for grade-school to middle-school writers . If wide-ruled notebook paper is what you , or your child , needs , this is as good as , or better than , any other option . With one caveat ... It 's the kind of thing best bought on sale , because off-season or single pack purchase can be absurdly pricey : 4 to 5 times the price of the same goods at better times ( like back to school events ) .	1
I bought this & # 34 ; Mead Filler Paper & # 34 ; because it costless than buying lined notebook . Plus , it 's easyto use.However , I wish lines were little bit more vividon the sheets so that I can see where I 'm writing.Overall , it 's a great paper.T . M .	1
It works well . Much cheaper at Walmart but I was in a hurry to get some school supplies while battling sickness so I just ordered it .	1
Good value at amazon . Paper is thin , comparable to cheap notebooks . Holes fit the binder and no problem writing on the paper . Lines are good and not too dark . Cheap enough to toss and to use as scrap paper .	1
This is a pack of standard , wide ruled writing paper that is 3 hole punched . There are 200 pages per package . We 've had no problems writing on this paper and putting it into a 3 ring binder.The pages themselves are well made , but might be a bit thinner than other standard papers . We have not experienced any problems with the paper yet , and we are a family of 2 adults , a 4 year old learning to draw and write basic letters , and a 7 year old doing basic sentences .	1
Those of us who 've used a i950 do n't need to be told that they drink ink like ... I do n't know ... like how a thirsty something drinks water . In my case , this has been a good incentive to think twice before I go to print anything . Now , this set is a true price break from what I was used to . I do n't really need an 8-pack but I did get one once , by mistake and I had no problem with the i950 , I just ended up with 2 extra cartridges.It 's low price , free shipping ... if this was a grocery item , I 'd probably set it up as an Amazon subscription . If anyone is aware of a better deal anywhere - it 's got to be genuine Canon ink - please leave a comment to this review and I will be more than grateful .	1
I 've tried replacement inks and they are all awful . My Canon prints beautifully and use ink better than most ink jet printers ( I have two i9900 and mp500 , as well as several epsons and had HPs but no more ) I print a lot of photos and my Canons print the best on plain paper of any ink jet I 've ever used , as long as I stick with the canon inks . I 'm lucky I did n't destroy my printer with those cheap , generic refills .	1
Great product , great colors . Here is a piece of advice : use the original manufacturer 's print cartridges irregardless of who made it and you will be fine . Try to use a knock-off or wrong part , and you are asking for trouble .	1
If you print high quality pictures , you ca n't get by without Canon ink with your Canon printer . Generic ink and refill schemes just suck every time . Buy what you need without regret . Not cheap . Not very much ink in the cartidge but it works well and looks great .	1
The large size printer needs special ink . Canon 's 13 x 19 printer requires the 8 color process . One of the things I found was on Amazon.com was some alternative supply of ink for one of their vendors . The quality of their ink compared favorably and we bought about a 3 year supply.The Ink from Canon is very high quality , but is pricey and especially compared to the competitor .	1
I always buy Canon ink for my Canon printer and they always perform as they were meant to by the manufacturer . There is a price break by buying in sets of 6 that I like .	1
Economical and works like it should . Always stick with brand inks with your printer . These do n't smudge and wo n't destroy your printer . I recommend canon brand inks .	1
I have bought the cheaper cartridges from various makers and found the ink in them to be very inferior compared to Canon ink . The cheaper cartridges seem to run out of ink faster and I mainly buy the black or letters with the cheaper cartridges .	1
I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online . On Amazon , even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only , it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you 'll get ( unless you have your own cartridges refilled ) . Now if you still want to use them , that 's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online . ( Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy . ) So my review for this product ? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was . Good place to buy from .	1
For my canon printers , I have always relied on the genuine canon made product . I do n't like the ink tanks running low so fast even if the printer is just sitting without daily use , but the colors have always been dependable .	1
Well , the other guys are all complaining about Amazon 's shipping charge . Amazon 's `` free shipping for over $ 25 '' offer comes and goes , so if you see it in effect -- it is as of today ( 10/12/2005 ) -- grab whatever you need . As for buying the ink tanks , just buy all three colors in the set at the same time to qualify.Anyway , let me talk about the ink tanks themselves . The three `` BCI-6 '' ink tanks work in the Canon Pixma iP3000 printer . ( Maybe in other models as well , but I have the iP3000 . ) These are official Canon ink tanks so you 'll know they 'll work well . The number of prints you get heavily depends on your printing habit , e.g. , what you print , how much you print , and at what quality you print.Using my usage as an example . I print at Normal Quality most of the time , and I print about 50 % photos ( at 200 or 300 dpi , depending on needs ) and 50 % web pages ( e.g. , flight confirmations , Hotmail messages , etc. ) . I do n't print Word text documents much . I 've run through 2 sets of ink tanks , and my very rough estimate is each set has lasted about 250-300 8.5 '' x11 '' sheets . Maybe more , but I do n't wish to raise your expectations too much . Suffice it to say that of all the inkjet printers I 've owned -- photo or not -- the iP3000 has a terrific ink capacity record . Of course , if you use one color more than the others , that particular ink tank ( or ink tank combinations ) will go out faster . ( For your reference , a few months ago I read in a magazine review the the average per letter-size print cost of the iP3000 came out to around 12 cents per page on plain paper , one of the lowest average costs for inkjets . Not sure what settings they used in their tests or how much they paid for ink tanks , though . ) In case you are interested ... the new Canon iP4200 model employs a new formula of ink which supposedly will not fade for at least 30 years . My own take is , no matter how you print your photos -- even at professional photo labs -- a photo print will eventually fade if exposed to light . It 's just a simple law of chemistry . So be sure to archive your digital photos on CDs or DVDs so 30 or 40 years from now , you can still print fresh copies and relive your treasured memories in their full colors .	1
Having genuine Canon ink has always produced the most predictable results . I have a profiled monitor for my color work flow . Output on Kodak Professional Photo paper using ICM profiles ( provided by Kodak on their website ) along with genuine Canon inks gives me excellent prints on my Canon i950 ( yes , it is getting up there in age , but still prints gorgeous prints ) .And for several years now , I find that Amazon usually has best prices online ( unless their competitor has a sale ) . B & H ; is brick-n-motor I use when I need a pack of ink at the last minute ( not Staples or OfficeMax , who charges way too much ) .	1
Excellent price for genuine Canon ink ... use this with Canon paper for visually stunning results that last . In my experience , it is smart to purchase extra Photo Magenta and Photo Cyan cartridges as they tend to run out first . It is wonderful to have the option of purchasing individual genuine Canon cartridges at such a reasonable price and have them delivered the next day or the day after via Amazon.If you are searching for the highest quality ink that delivers exquisite , professional results , look no further.Thanks , Amazon , for making my life easier and offering this excellent 5-Star ink at such a reasonable price .	1
Ink is ink and this one definitely serves its purpose . Pictures come out fresh with this stuff .	1
Great Canon quality ink tank . Good value , but if you need other ink colors the best deal is AMAZON 's combo paper and ink pack which includes cyan , magenta , yellow , 3e black , and 50 sheets of thinner glossly paper ( a very good deal ) . Highly recommend this product or any other Canon ink products ! !	1
I needed Canon inks for my 13x19 printer and these tanks render great color reproduction in all cases . I wish they had a high capasity cartridge so they would last a little longer .	1
The ink seems to work well in the printer , however the cartridges really leak as you are putting them in , so be sure you are wearing rubber gloves when you install them . Other than that I was supprised at the lack of problems . I have tried other refills and have had nothing but difficulties , but these ( so far ) seem to work quite well.4 stars only because of the leakyness .	1
These ink cartridges I bought for my somewhat older printer ( Canon IP6000D ) but is still running great . It makes some noises while printing but the quality that I receive is worth it.I have purchased very many Canon products and was always satisfied . I would and will continue to recommend them .	1
This is well priced refil for my Canon 870 . Colors work well , and they are original Canon products . i just wish they did not cost as much as they do . Printers are cheap , but thye get you back with the ink cost !	1
I have a love/hate relationship with my Canon i9900 , also know as the incredible ink sucking machine . Photo quality is amazing , how quickly it eats through ink cartridges if frightening.That said , there is simply no substitute for the Canon inks . The aftermarket stuff will look awful at best , will clog up your machine at worst.Like all ink , this stuff is obscenly over-priced . Still , the Amazon 8-pack set will save you a small fortune versus buying them seperate . Recenly I needed a single color and ran off to a big box store . The single cartridge was about $ 15.So , use only genuine Canon ink and buy it only from Amazon . Nuff said .	1
Buy the original Canon ink if you are using it for your photos . The generic brands will fade in a few years.Of all the Canon ink , only one came damaged ( my loss ) . But most is good quality but I wish they pack more ink in a package . It still runs out fast.Buy 2 at once from Amazon and save with free shipping .	1
I have n't found a cheaper way to buy Canon ink carts for my i9900 printer . I just wo n't use 3rd party inks for my prints , some of which I use to create cards which I sell . I have printed hundreds of prints with the i9900/BCI-6 and have NEVER had any plugging or printer problems due to inks . I just hope that this package deal will continue for those of us committed to this particular printer/cartridge technology .	1
I have never had a problem with Canon inks . I have bought generics , but never been satisfied . Either they ruined my printer , or the colors were off .	1
Thanks again I have to stay with the canon brand of ink , the other brands clogs up my printers . Thank you once again	1
Unlike many reviewers who spill out their thoughts after a few days with their new toy , we 've had our `` new '' Brother HL-1440 about six months -- and the short form is that we are highly satisfied . This is our third laser ( the prior two being HP 4P and 5P -- typical home models ) so we 're used to good quality printing . No exception is the output of the Brother and the speed is quite decent as well . Best of all , we have not yet had a jam , despite printing probably about 2500 pages or so since putting it into service . We 're still on the original toner as well ! We use both the manual feed slot a lot ( for envelopes and special paper or card stock ) as well as the high capacity tray with excellent results . Our only quibble is that the feed slot can be a little tricky to get the paper straight , so sometimes the printout is crooked . The printer is a little slow to startup and print first page if it had previously been in `` sleep mode '' but nothing that unusual . Sometimes our lights dim a little when it fires up , so we 're guessing it draws some pretty good power at that instant ! Incidentally we used the parallel interface at first and now use the USB connection -- no problem with either . The software was easy to install and stepped you through the startup proces quite clearly.Bottom line , we 've been totally delighted with the product -- and consider it almost unbeatable at the low price we paid !	1
I selected this printer over the Samsung ML-1430 and the Hewlett Packard LaserJet 1000 . After reviewing all three online and then `` live '' at an office supply store , I ordered the Brother HL-1440 . While the print quality may be similar for all three printers , the Brother HL-1440 's build quality , easy memory upgrade path , and cheap consummables made it the clear front runner . Further distinguishing this machine is its superb handling of thicker media . It produces excellent results on cardstock , using a convenient manual feed slot on the front of the machine . Note also that the paper handling of the Brother is , in general , more robust than its Samsung and HP counterparts . The Samsung uses the top-loaded , ink-jet style paper feed system that tends to have less precise alignment . The HP uses a non-removable paper tray that is flimsy at best . The Brother , on the otherhand , uses a standard removable paper tray that is durable and handles envelopes and legal-sized paper just as easily as letter-sized . ( And do n't discount the handy manual feed for the single envelope . ) Out of the box , USB setup of this unit on a Windows XP Home machine was a snap . The 1440 comes with a fully illustrated easy setup guide that will have you up and running in no time . All XP drivers are available on the disks that are shipping with these machines at the time of this review.One last note : Do n't forget to order a USB ( or parallel ) cable with your printer !	1
Welcome to the world of laser printing . You 're talking to someone who came from a time when laser printers were a five figure investment . Sure they created print that was so smooth , that the edges were like glass , even under a microscope . Like the rest of us , we trudged through the fuzzy , dull , and off gray text of bubble jets , until they finally created one that would give you a nice edge to the naked eye . Under a microscope even todays latest results are not equal to this inexpensive 1440.To be creating professional looking text for only two cents per page , and at the rate of up to 15 PPM , for this kind of money makes it a must have . I broke out the super magnifying glass and the edges are glass smooth . My Lexmark X83 , which is touted at `` laser like '' does n't pass the under the microscope test . I still like the X83 for color work , and since it is a multi-user machine , for it 's scanning and copying features . If you have a bubble jet , or inkjet machine , you want a Brother laser printer too . You can hook one up to the USB port , and put the other one on your printer port , thanks to Brothers dual input , standard printer cable , or USB capacity.Some other great features are : 250 sheet paper tray that sits under the unit , which is reminiscent of the better machines . With up to 15 PPM print speed , the first time you see it print , you think it is a printing mistake because it is coming out so fast . No sooner does the previous sheet hit the tray , one is coming out right on top of it . It comes with 2 Meg of ram built in , and is expandable with a single slot which will take up to a 128 Meg chip . ( Something available very inexpensively for a generic , check it out via a google search . ) The main feature of the brother line of printers is that they have a very professional look for an entry level laser.First and foremost , as stated in Consumer Reports , who rated the Brother 1440 as their number one pick , the per page print cost is only 2 cents per page . Compared to a MINIMUM of 6 cents , and as much as $ 1.50 per page for an inkjet photograph , you can see how quickly printing costs can add up . With the Brother laser printers , you can concentrate more on how you can print your message to the world , instead of how you are going to afford to keep pumping lots of money into your inkjet cartridges.A key advantage to a laser printer is that they use a dry powder , instead of wet ink that can and does dry out . I have a friend who bought an NEC laser in 1985 , printed infrequently , and the cartridge just ran out in the last couple of years . Not a common example , but it gives you a good idea of the advantages of a laser using dry powder.Comparing the Brother 5040 , which comes with 8 meg of ram instead of 2 , has more onboard fonts , and several other capacities , as described in the owners manual , to the 1440 , makes you want to buy that one instead . BUT Consumer Reports rated the 1440 as their top pick , and the 5040 rated about 5th in line . They stated it was the loudest of the printers , had comparable text quality , but did n't score quite as well in printing graphics . Mate that to the reduced price of the 1440 , and the fact that a ram chip upgrade is inexpensive , makes the world of quality laser printing something everyone should have.Brother just came out with the 5140 to replace the 5040 , but the only improvement is a faster print speed of 21 PPM instead of 17 . The 1440 is rated at 15.First and foremost is the top quality , textbook level of printing , for such a small amount of money . If you buy a 1440 at current prices , and then at replacement time , buy one of the generic replacement toner cartridges that produce twice the number of pages as the standard ones , you can bring the price per page cost down to a penny . That is quite a savings over the five cents per page copying cost at your local office store.The speed , flexibility , and capacity of producing documents on demand , makes this a good investment.Heed the warnings on the bag containing the cartridge , and DO NOT move the machine without first removing the cartridge , or you can seriously damage the printer . That is probably the reason why some people were getting streaks . When the toner gets low , and you start to get a gray background on the pages , replace it.I have n't been this excited about a business tool in quite some time . It will make a great addition to your arsenal . Highly recommended .	1
I 've had this printer for about four months now and it works great . I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily . Good quality text and graphics though I 'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast . I bought a generic memory card for $ 8 . The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds . Toner prices , even when you eventually need to replace the drum , are still about the cheapest of any laser .	1
This laser printer is amazing . Buy it . It is fast , quiet and reliable . I have added another 32MB of memory which helps with printing graphics and large documents . The replacement parts and toner are inexpensive compared to other brands . I think it offers more features and quality than others three times the price . My only regret is that I did n't go for the color version .	1
One day while strolling through Office Max on Michigan Avenue in Chicago , I stumbled across what I thought was an exceptional deal - a 1200 DPI laser printer under $ 200 ! It almost seemed too good to be true . After some initial skepticism and subsequent analysis , I realized that it was , in fact , an excellent deal - for a niche low volume user who needs fast printing.As a frequent author of reviews , I would typically check Amazon before buying such an item . So after returning to my office , printer in hand , my enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by the negative reviews on the HL-1440 . I almost returned it before seeing the print quality and performing some basic calculations . In the end , I am glad I kept it as it serves my need for having a fast , high quality , low volume printer in my one-man office.Currently I own a [ large ] microwave-sized multifunction HP inkjet ( d155xi ) , which is at my home office . I decided that if I needed another printer in a second location , it should be a inexpensive laser printer . Initially , I thought I would purchase a $ 300 HP . My concern with such printers and the other sub- $ 500 printers was the cost of the consumables . Experience with ink-jets ( such as my HP-d155xi ) demonstrated that the ink expenditures are a real killer . This , of course , is a ploy by the manufacturers to recoup equipment costs via pricy consumables.The sales associate at Office Max suggested that the replacement toner cartridges last 6000 sheets for around $ 60 . After some mental calculations , I figured that it would be a good deal . Only when I returned to read the Amazon customer reviews did I learn that there was a second consumable - the drum - that lasts , at best , 20,000 sheets . This is something I did not anticipate . While I have no way of determining if this second consumable was created for purely technical reasons or merely as a financial/marketing strategy , I would guess that it is a bit of both . Moreover , at a cost of $ 115 w/tax , the drum costs about 65 % of the cost of a HL-1440 , making a second drum purchase a psychological obstacle.To determine if the Brother HL-1440 was a good value , I opened Excel and performed some basic calculations , which you can see below.Assumptions - Drum replaced at 15,000 sheets first time ; 18,000 additional sheets second time . High capacity toner lasts stated 6000 sheets , original yields 3000 sheets . Note that it does n't come with a USB cable ( $ 20 ) but I had a surplus one. $ w_tax total $ total sheets _sheetprinter $ 176 $ 176 3k 5.9HC toner 1 $ 57 $ 232 9k 2.6HC toner 2 $ 57 $ 289 15k 1.9New Drum $ 115 $ 404 15kHC toner 3 $ 57 $ 461 21k 2.2HC toner 4 $ 57 $ 518 27k 1.9HC toner 5 $ 57 $ 574 33k 1.7As you can see , if you chose to toss the printer at 15,000 sheets , the average price per sheet is 1.9 cents . This is far below the cost of printing at Kinko 's - excluding transportation costs and convenience value . The tricky part comes from the decision to purchase a new drum . It takes a while to recoup the cost of the drum , making it a very tough decision for some . Moreover , one has to guess how long the other components will last . Given my level of use , I would probably not purchase the drum . In the three years that it would take to wear out the first drum , another , more cost effective solution would become available.Like expectancy issues aside , there are some nice features to this printer . Print quality is excellent ( as least after the first 500 pages ) . While somewhat lightweight compared to workgroup printers , it is built better than most inkjets I have used . Nice touches include the paper level meter where a mechanical needle on the front indicates the height of the paper reserves in the tray.Some strange problems include mirror printing from certain applications , such as MS Streets and Trips 2004 . This is corrected by a patch . There is also a recurring `` Found New Hardware '' problem where it creates a new printer icon ( Copy 1 , 2 , etc ) . It usually stops at copy 2 . Brother suggests that this is a Windows XP problem . As I have used multiple USB printers on this and similar computers , I doubt that it is just an XP problem . In the end , it appears that a full drive uninstall may have solved this minor annoyance.In the end , I would suggest this printer is a good choice for low volume home offices or single person companies . If you are like me , someone who prints around a 100 pages per week and needs a fast printer when on deadline , the HL-1440 is a good choice . I would not recommend this for any moderate volume or workgroup environment.Pro'sExcellent print qualityVery inexpensiveLow total cost of ownership/price per pageNice paper level meterCon'sPoor front interfaceShort lifePossible driver problemsStrange printing anomalies ( corrected by patches ) Only 2MB memoryNo USB cabled included	1
I have a two computer `` network '' at home in which I previously used two average quality inkjet printers ( one for each pc ) . With laser printers having cost so much in the past , I never bothered to put one in at home . I was surprised to see that this model is not only affordable at its regular price of 99 dollars , but I found it at Office Max for 79.99 ( they are no longer going to carry it ) ! Because I have had great success using the Brother HL5170DN at work , and because a friend has the 1440 and loves it , I decided to give the HL-1440 a try for home use . I can say without a doubt that this is one good printer . I would think that even if I had paid twice as much as I did ( which makes it all the sweeter ) . The print speed is very fast and the quality is great . I am still impressed with how crisp and clean this machine can produce images and graphics.I am told that the toner cartridge that came with the printer ( # 430 ) is good for about 3,000 pages . By factoring that plus the cost of replacement cartridges , I feel that this printer is a fantastic choice for home use . I highly recommend it !	1
I have n't experienced the problems with the drum that previous reviewers seem to have , and I 've had my printer for over a year . The toner lasts forever , the print quality is excellent , the speed is great ( especially if you come to this unit from an inkjet printer ) , and the unit is relatively quiet . I have only one gripe with it : the design makes it really , really tough to deal with paper jams . I have found myself bent like a pretzel with a computer tweezer tool in hand , trying to find an opening through which to pick apart a piece of paper that has gotten stuck somewhere inside the printer . I 'm invariably at fault for the jam , leaving something lying where it would impede the exiting of the printed sheets , causing them to back up and accordion themselves in the printer . Nightmare ! ! ! Otherwise , I 've had nothing but good things from the HL-1440 , considering the low price ( I remember when laser printers were only for the wealthy ) . Hope they release a next-generation that clam-shells so you can get those jams taken care of !	1
This is not a high end corded phone , but if you need an extra phone in the basement like I did it dose the job .	1
THIS is the Trimline phone that I remember from past years ! I had bought an AT & T ; `` Trimline '' phone that was really poor - it did n't have the features that I expected , and remembered . I bought one of these in white color for my wife , and then found that it was so good that I ordered the black model for myself.This phone has a backlit screen ( excellent for night-time calls ) , powered by the phone line - no batteries required . The light intensity is n't very high , but is readable in the dark . I found the quick dial use to be fine , although I was a bit surprised that one needs to program in the emergency number ( is n't 911 standard ? ) , but maybe some people want to call their relatives in an emergency or something . I have mine wall mounted , although the unit works either wall or desk.The phone is handsome , and the features ( handset and ringer volume , quick dial , etc ) work well.The only drawback is that the handset is fairly large . I am 6 ' tall with big hands , and it fits me fine , but if you are purchasing for a smaller hand you might need a different model .	1
This is a very good 2nd phone . It is in my bedroom . It is very lightweight and suits the purpose . It is also very reasonably priced .	1
I rcvd my black trim line phone today . Out of the 352 reviews I only read the # 1 rated ones , to see what was said . Several people said people on the other end can not hear well . I immediately tested mine , and called 2 friends , who both said they could hear me quite clearly . It is funny how there are always people who harshly criticize products in these reviews , yet so many other people do not find anything wrong , I wonder how that can be , can there really be such a big difference between one unit and another . I thought I would like the Black color best , and it cost less than the White , but I see now that the Black shows finger print smudges very easily . I will be keeping it on my bookshelf for use during power outage .	1
Best corded phone on the market -- voice quality , lighted keypad , small footprint . It 's everything I need .	1
Simple no frills compact desk ( or wall mount ) phone . Glossy black version looks good . Works well . Excellent audio . Excellent value . Highly recommend .	1
The AT & T ; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out . We bought three of these ( one for our house , shop , and my mother 's house ) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages ( more frequent than I like in our area ) .We have these connected to line splitters ( Belkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter ) and they work just fine . These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which , although limited , does give us some control . It is also handy that the keypad is `` backlit '' and draws power directly from the phone line , allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial , we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended !

I used to work for a large telephone company including time spent in a `` Central Office '' or `` CO '' . The CO is the place where your telephone lines go after leaving your house and where the telephone company has all of its equipment . I also did field telecommunications in the Army.In a natural disaster , cell phone towers have a very limited amount of battery backup . That means your cell phone will not work about 5 - 8 hours after an earthquake . That 's what happened to all of us after the '89 Loma Prieta earthquake.However , for landlines , the telephone company maintains a very extensive system of battery backup power in the Central Office so your landline phone will continue to work even after an emergency or after losing power ( yes , your corded phone uses some electricity to work , but that electricity is produced by the phone company ) . In fact , after the regular battery backup power is exhausted in the CO , the phone company has the capability to drop generator trucks to run the equipment and keep your corded phone working indefinitely.There also are other technical reasons that you want a landline in a natural disaster instead of a cell phone , but basically the equipment running your landline can handle many more calls when everyone picks up the phone at the same time to call `` 911 '' and their aunt Mildred.So , bottom line , keep your landline phone line and one of these very inexpensive AT & T ; 210 CORDED phones on hand , if only for emergencies or when the power goes out and you ca n't use your cordless phone or cell phone . By the way , the voice quality of my two AT & T ; 210 's are excellent .	1
I purchased this two years ago for one reason : to have a phone I can use when the power goes out , which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific ... as long as they have electric power . When the power goes out , however , they are helpless . I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out , but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery . I can check with the power company , talk with neighbors , and potentially most important , if there 's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails . Just store it in a location that 's easy to access when you have no lights .	1
All these cheap phones today have nothing in their base so when you grab the phone you pull the base off the desk or table . This is the classic ATT phone with a nice heavy base and a design that still looks great today . The black is perfect for the home office and the white for a nighstand or kitchen .	1
With everyone having cell phones and cordless phones , I still like to have a corded landline phone so when the power goes out as it often does here in the East , I can still make calls.Its a very reasonable price and good product I would recommend if you think like I do regarding power outages .	1
I like this phone so much that I bought a second one in white . It works well , does not require power to operate , and still has a few options of more expensive phones . By using a key combination , you can participate in 3-way calling . It has a mute button , volume control , Flash , auto redial , and can store up to 12 numbers in memory . It has an illuminated keypad and a 3-level ringer adjustment button . It is lighter than Trimline phones from the '80s , but it does n't feel cheap . It 's just that all of the analog parts inside from that decade have been replaced by digital ones . Even if this phone craps out after a year , it is so affordable that I consider it a & # 34 ; disposable & # 34 ; item . I recommend buying this item .	1
back up phone that operates without power . So can be plugged into any jack in the house . runs if we trip any circuit .	1
We have three cordless phones in the house , but we 've always kept one hard-wired phone to use when the electrical power goes out . ( The power lines in our area are aboveground , but most telephone lines are underground . During storms , we often lose electrical power , but the phone lines are usually intact . The cordless phones , which require AC power , are useless at those times , but a hard-wired phone still works . ) When our hard-wired phone recently died after about twenty-five years of service , we replaced it with the AT & T ; 210 Corded Phone . It 's a fine telephone , reminiscent in style of the old AT & T ; Princess Phone of the 1960s , but modernized with memory-dial . Other than that , it 's pretty much a basic , bare-bones telephone , which is what we need during power outages.The AT & T ; 210 appears to be solidly built , and we expect to get many years of service from it . For the very low price , it meets our expectations perfectly .	1
When you need a phone during an emergency or power outage , when you want a phone that is reliably located on the `` base '' where someone has n't walked away with the handset , this is the IDEAL phone ! The phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack . If you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord . I like this ! It 's nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind ! The phone comes with pulse and tone dialing ( needed to use computerized dialing . )	1
Its an old school phone that works . Setup in 30 seconds . Not much you need to know on this one .	1
I liked the heavy duty early AT & T ; Touch-Tone phones ( circa 1975-1985 ) as they had a solid feel to them , their ringers were loud enough and did n't sound like a robot . Unfortunately , `` they do n't make 'em like they used to '' and for many of you , that 's OK.For me , I still like a phone I can hold on my neck . I like this one as it has a volume dial . It still sounds a bit like I 'm down in a hole , `` tinny '' I guess , but it 's better than some of the others that I 've tried.The base is really light weight , so if it 's not hung on a wall ( which you can do with this one ) it will probably pull off the table if you stretch the phone and it 's cored too far from it 's base.It has a lighted key pad , sort of ( the light is really faint ) .So , it works , has some options that are OK , and if you want one like they used to make , this is OK , but not perfect .	1
Phone looks and works fine . If you are looking for an affordable wall phone , this is the one . Just be SURE to read the instructions concerning wall mount mode !	1
We needed one corded phone for when the power goes out . This one fits the bill at a reasonable price .	1
Cheapest and most durable as well as dependable . I do n't see any issues with this phone , it sounds great and it can be loud .	1
I recently bought this phone for my father who likes his phones simple and easy to use . This telephone by AT & T ; works better than other , much fancier phones , including two expensive cordless phones with extra handsets , when I had to get a new phone for my new home . The construction of this telephone reflects great engineering ; and it 's very , very reliable for a price that 's very inexpensive these days for a phone . Yes , it is corded ; but when all you really need is a basic phone this really does the job.The phone has back lit buttons which are desirable for those of us who are elderly or in any way sight impaired . The buttons could be brighter but the back lighting does improve upon no lighting . The phone offers well known features including `` last number redial , '' and allows you to set the phone up with your telephone company so that you can use this phone with features like call waiting and three way calling . The phone has a mute feature , adjustable ringer volume and more . These functions never disappoint me . It also has a small knob that lets you switch between touch tone and pulse ( rotary ) dialing . I use touch tone dialing as most people do . I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing . Cool ! If you want to take a nap without the phone ringing , just turn the ringer off by using the knob at the base of the phone.I highly recommend this telephone for people who need a basic phone at a cheap price that still has a few `` frills '' to like including memory speed dialing and call waiting . The extra features give you all you truly need to make this a well constructed telephone at a ridiculously inexpensive price . Sure , the back lighting for the buttons on the phone could be brighter ; but overall this is still quite a good phone for the price . The phone takes up little space and it can even be wall mounted to completely save counter space in a kitchen or any other room .	1
There is no doubt that more people are choosing to get mobile phones for whenever they need to call up , as well as cordless phones for mobile use at home . But there are still those of us whom would just rather prefer the need of just having a simple phone for one place in the house to call . That is the case with AT & T ; 's 210 Corded Phone . This is a very simple and easy to use phone that works for just about anyplace in the house , where you want to keep your calls stationery . I also found it to be very easy to read and understand , and rings louder than my cordless handsets in need of a call to home . If you really are looking for a extra phone for the home or the office , than I definitely recommend this classic phone from AT & T . ; Price : B+Convience : BOverall : B 1/2+	1
This is an ok basic phone , which is what I wanted , in case my electricity goes out . Works fine .	1
My portable phone finally went haywire so I decided to buy this corded phone since I do n't really need a portable and all the static that comes with it . This AT & T phone is a basic design , feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound . No static , no distortion , no sounding like people are in the distance or speaking from a straw or whatever , it sounds just like the good old solid phones we used to have before all the portable junk started spreading all over the place . I accidentally dropped it when answering a call and it came out unscathed . If you want a solid , basic phone without bells and whistles , buy this one . Actually , it does have the ability to program thirteen numbers ( a feature I used successfully ) so it does have some bells and whistles .	1
This is the most inexpensive and reliable way to use a MagicJack . I bought a new MagicJack for my university office . I make a lot of calls to Canada and it would be inappropriate for me to use the university 's phone to make my calls . This little phone stores neatly in my drawer . When I want to make a MagicJack call , I just plug it in .	1
Remeber what a phone used to feel like and sound like . This is the old phone as you remember it but its new and fine . Works great .	1
This is a good basic corded phone . I have had trouble with my Comcast Telephone line for months and no one has been able to fix it . So I bought this inexpensive phone as a backup to my cordless phones .	1
I 'm guessing they are working as expected and I 've received no complaints ; they are being used in a different department .	1
I have my electrical phones and cellular in the house . However , here in Miami we do get serious storms and hurricanes during which time , electrical phones do not function . Therefore , I have now this extra unit connected to my printer/scanner which I use while sitting at my PC and should we have a hurricane , can transfer to my bedroom for regular communications . You will be surprised how many time the phone lines do not go down but you can not use the other phones because there is no electricity ! Great deal . Only wish it had lights on the buttons , which I believe is supposed to have but I do n't see them at least on mine .	1
I bought this paper after purchasing an Epson Aritsan 730 printer , only to see it not show very good print quality on generic printer paper . I had tested the Epson Photo paper , and found it to be superior in quality to the HP premium paper that I had used for Photos , so I figured perhaps I needed to go with better paper for my basic printing as well . Made a huge difference . Text looks wonderful on it . Paper is a nice thickness and does n't feel as flimsy as most generic papers . It should ... afterall , it 's roughly double the price of bargain paper . But when you 're looking to print something and have it look nice , better to go with good quality paper	1
I typically use Boise X9 Bright 20lb paper in both my laser and inkjet printers . This Epson product is ever so slightly heavier . I barely notice it , but for two sided printing , the 24lb paper is an improvement as you do n't see the print as easily on the other side of the page . I also notice that it is somewhat brighter in shade and smoother , allowing for the inkjet to do a better job with fine print . For regular black type , the laser still outperforms the appearance of even the best inkjets , but since so much of our work has color these days , it 's nice to find an inexpensive solution for at least the paper side of the equation . This is a step up from basic copy paper , but it 's not such a step up that anyone will say , & # 34 ; Oooo ... nice paper. & # 34 ; Watch for a good price , as the price varies from $ 5 to $ 10 for 500 sheets .	1
I do a lot of printing , both black and white and in color . I 've used several different types of paper , and this type is equal to the best , at a very nice price .	1
This is a great , inexpensive , every day paper . It might be just a tad light for more formal presentations , but I do n't think it 's designed for that . This is your every day paper . I 'd order again and again without hesitation .	1
hello , since i purchased a new epson artisan printer , i needed some bright white paper for everyday use . this brand of paper is a little brighter in b/w printing than my older hp white paper . the cost is great , the delivery was super fast , and i did not have to resort to using somewhat old paper that was not very bright . three positive things going for it . i will now continue to order from amazon because of the selection and great delivery .	1
If you are looking for a thin paper that reproduces well and is easy to work with , this is it . It is thick enough to not easily tear like ultra-thin rice papers , etc . and the quality of print , at least with Epson ink at the highest quality setting , is better than other papers of this weight . The cost is actually not bad , all things considered .	1
I recently tried this paper to use with my HP inkjet printer that is about two years old . I am very impressed . In fact , this multipurpose 108 brightness paper ( yes , that 's what they advertise , 108 brightness ) by Epson gives you something to sing about ! I use this paper with my inkjet printers ; and I can use it to make signs to tape to my front door indicating to delivery people which doorbell to ring ! Actually , it 's good for just about anything I need to print with my inkjet printer , including intense colors or artwork from a webpage that I want to keep in printed form for my records . The paper may `` buckle '' ever so slightly if you have to print a large square , circle or rectangular shape in a single color ; but this `` buckling '' is n't too noticeable.In addition , this paper practically never jams in my printer at home . Nevertheless , I always fan the paper to make extra certain that it does n't jam . After I fan the paper to make sure two pieces of paper are n't stuck to each other , then I place it in my inkjet printer tray.Each page is a clean cut 8 inches by 11 inches . Great ! Although they do n't say this , I would imagine that this paper can also be used in copiers , plain paper fax machine and maybe even in laser printers . If you want to use this paper with laser printers , print out a test page or two before you buy several reams.This paper never `` goes stale , '' so stock up on it if you can catch a sale on it . As of this writing , the Amazon price seems a bit high so check with Amazon to make sure that the above price is correct.In any event , this is excellent paper ; and I highly recommend this product .	1
This is great paper and it produces excellent quality output . very crisp and nice colors . My only complaint is the price .	1
Not that I would steal from work . Just saying - it 's a quality paper , well worth the price . It 's brighter and crisper than your typical office copy/printer paper .	1
Bought this epson paper to go along with new printer .	1
This paper costed a bit more than what I wanted , but it seems to be of good quality , thickness , and brightness . Once in a while , my printer takes more than one sheet of the paper , and it 's frustrating when this happens , but this may be a problem with the printer .	1
This paper is fine but in comparison to another brand we use ( of the same weight and brightness ) , it is nearly as substantial feeling or looking . As far as paper goes , it 's not bad , but maybe not the best brand out there .	1
When counting the conceivable number of ice cream cones you could eat within a 365-day year , a calculator managing the basic functions should be all you need ... and that is all right here in this Canon.Some days are like the one today . The summer swelts , as it is apt to do , but what about you ? Worry not . Traipse onward to your favorite creamery . How often can you do this ? That 's where the calculator comes in.Work in your figuring confectionery and coffee shop visits , stops by the corner hot dog vendor , and the lovely friend you might bring along to each celebration of taste . Consider taxes , tips , and extra chocolate sprinkles . This math will take a focused mind , and an accurate calculator.Large numbers , visible digits , and extra buttons for those with the mathematical acumen to enjoy them , the Canon calculator sits snugly on any desk or cafe counter . It will suffice most dining needs , powered by sunny days and ice cream desires.Ensure the goodness of a year filled with flavor , well-paced through each week by knowing the cost and averages of chocolate , cappuccino and gelato . Be prepared for hot fudge sundaes , mochas and nougat bars . When December comes , as the year has passed , you will be able to tell the one you love , `` This one 's on me , '' with confidence , as you will have studied the numbers on your Canon calculator. -- Brockeim	1
I have found this to be a pretty straightforward easy calculator . Compact , but the buttons are n't so small that you hit three at once ...	1
It 's the 3rd one I have bought for our office this year . I am pretty sure that people are eating them .	1
It has an eye-angled , upright display , and is perfect to work on a desk . The keypad is not as soft as other calculators on the market , giving you a retro and reliable feel ( if you have ever used those full size desktop calculators popular a decade ago , you know what I am talking about . ) I find other calculators ( e.g. , Sharp EL-377T ) awkward to use on a desk . They are perfect for handheld . If you want to have a calculator on your desk and operate with one hand and without leaning forward to check the LCD screen , this Canon LS-82Z is perfect for you .	1
Canon makes a fine small pocket calculator that I trust . I understand , of course , that some people will want this for the same reasons I wanted it while other people would never be satisfied with this calculator . Therefore , here are the pros and cons of this calculator : PROS:1 ) It can use either solar power or battery power.2 ) The keys are pretty much the right size.3 ) The numbers on the screen are relatively easy to read and it 's got a memory feature.4 ) The calculator comes with a `` function card . '' This will help you or refresh your memory as to how to use this calculator to its maximum potential.5 ) This product is relatively inexpensive ; this is perfect for anyone who wants an affordable pocket calculator.6 ) The display is angled toward the viewer 's eyes so it 's easy to read the display -- and the display does n't even need full brightness in order for you to read it ! CONS:1 ) It does n't have features that a statistician would want . If you want to use this for matrix and vector calculations , you 're flat out of luck . Get a scientific calculator instead.2 ) The change sign button is very difficult to even notice -- it 's on the `` % '' button ! 3 ) The three key limit on the memory function may frustrate people.Overall , this calculator is perfect for anyone who wants a regular , reliable and inexpensive calculator just to do basic functions . Again , statisticians and other people will not be satisfied with this ; but I was pleased overall . It 's a great calculator for most people ; and so I 'll give this a four star review .	1
I first saw the CANON LS-82z calculator at my local bank . Itwas anchored to a table , so no one would take it , and wasthere for people to tally up deposits and/or withdrawals . It isso little , so useful , so -- well , cute -- that I found myselfanthropomorphizing it , ( that is , turning an innanimate objectinto something which is living ... at least in my imagination , and falling completely in love with the adorable littlecalculator at first sight , ( and use ! ) . I wanted so much to takeit home with me , ( as a calculator -- AND pet ! ) Perhaps it'sdue to the fact that I live in a no-pet building that helpedfoister these , er ... .feelings in me , but the fact is that it ISa rather small and compact little calculator , ( only 3.5 x 4.5 x1.2 inches in size ) , has easy-to-use hard , ( but not too hard ) plastic keys , and a nice big 8-digit display ! It also seemedjust the right size fit in my hand ... though , of course , tetheredas it was to the table in the bank , I could n't try it out . No -- I did NOT hear the little calculator say , `` Take me home with you ! '' -- but it was fun to IMAGINE it was saying this . I also knew thebank had probably searched very carefully to find the right modelcalculator to put on the bank table . So -- with this free advicethat this was a good calculator , ( which the bank had unknowinglygiven me -- and every other bank customer ! ) , and my own immediateliking to it -- though I knew I could n't take the bank 's modelhome with me , I did the next best thing : I wrote down the modelnumber , and looked for it on the internet . Sure enough -- therethe calculator I had seen in the bank , ( or maybe one of it'sfirst or second cousins ! ) , was there on Amazon ! Immediately , Iliberated ... .er , that is , bought ... two of them , hoping , ( in myimagination , that is ) , that these little calculators would finda happy home in my condo ! When the calculators arrived , I took one out of its proteciveplastic casing , and immediately put the number `` 107734 '' on it.Then I turned the calculator upside down . As with any calculator , the word `` heLLO ! '' appeared on the screen . ( There 's a whole bookof these calculator tricks , which I mean to look up on Amazonas at the earliest opportunity ! ) Well , the little Canon LS=82z does fit nicely in the palm of myhand , and works just as well in my home , as it does at thebank . The keys are HARD plastic -- which means they do NOT getsoft and difficult to use after a while . However , `` hard '' doesnot mean `` difficult '' here -- the keys are a pleasure to use ! They are small enough to keep the size of the calculator down , but big enough for adult hands to use . And -- this IS a solarAND battery calculator . You can always test this on any calcu-lator . Just be sure the calculator is on , and showing numbers.Then put your finger over the solar-battery panel . If thenumbers fade , then the calculator is a solar-powered calculator , only . If they do not fade , then obviously a battery is in thecalculator , too -- as is the case here.It 's true this calculator has only a three-key memory , and somepeople find this a great inconvenience . To me , it 's only a veryminor inconvenience , and one I can easily live with . The `` change-sign '' ( from plus to minus , or vice versa ) , key is strangely printedon the same key as `` % '' . Sadly , there seems no way to use the '' change sign '' function , as directions are not given on the back ofthe package , and there are no other directions given . I don'tchange the sign , often -- so again , this is a minor inconvenience , for me . But if you must change signs from plus to minus , or viceversa , often , I sadlty must suggest you `` adopt '' another calculator.The biggest disappointment , though , is that , although this ISpowered by a battery , ( presumably a button model ) , as well as solarpower , THERE ARE ONLY TWO SCREWS , ON TOP , IN THE BACK OF THECALCULATOR . This means that it 's all but impossible to take thebattery out , and one will be left , eventually , with the choice ofeither using this as only a solar calculator , or getting anothercalculator altogether . A mean thing to do to both calculator ... and user.Still , I plan to use and enjoy my litte LS-82z . And if I anthropor-morphize once in a while , what of it ? Sometime back , an entireTV show , ( 'WONDERFALLS ' ) , was based on this idea of anthropormorph-ism . It stayed on the air only a short time ... but during thattime , made money for everyone connected in its production !	1
I know there is a calculator on my computer , but I still love regular calculators and this one is a convenient , compact size . Since this is dual powered , it will last longer and you can recharge it with solar power.The size of this calculator is nice because it fits in your hand while you calculate away . I find I make less mistakes , although I do sort of miss my calculator with the larger key pad.~The Rebecca Review	1
About the size of the palm of my hand ( men 's large ) . works well . Nothing to get excited about , but a good basic calculator	1
This is a great product . The cartridges have a little window to see how much label is left . Very handy . The cartridges are also very easy to change . The graphics and borders are nice too . Very good value , highly recommended .	1
After getting this I realized a serious lack in Dymo labelers : limited color selection . I 'm much less interested in black on red , blue , yellow , green , etc . I need to label black surfaces and want white on clear or on black which Dymo does not make . Brother and Casio do , although both in limited tape sizes . The only other drawback with this labeler is limited type sizes .	1
This is a great label maker . It is quality made and the labels look very professional . The refills are not so costly to break the bank . It can do many differnt fonts and also print 2 lines . It was a great deal on the lightening deal day and it 's just as great at this great regular price.You will not be disappointed with this item .	1
For the price , I am glad I bought this . I use it at work , and it easily prints out the labels I type in , and I have had for almost a year , and still going on the same roll ( use it about twice a month for labeling office supplies )	1
This labeler is simple , it does everything a label gun should ! I have labeled so much stuff with this gun , index tabs , to containers - the variable size option , and double line features come in handy so you do not use all your tape up ! The price of the refill tape cartridges si pretty cheep compared to others.If you just want a simple labeler that does what is suppose to do and does n't pretend to be anything else - then get this one !	1
Sometimes buying an item like this is easier online . Running to many stores to find it is tedious .	1
This item works the way it is advertised -- no complaints here . Shipped on time , no issues with the packaging , no defects on the item .	1
This is a great deal on the HP ink , it fit into the printer just perfect . I even purchased a couple of boxes of this ink , and when the printer broke , I just ordered another printer to fit the ink . So it has worked out well .	1
I loved using this ink cartridge in my school printer . I had to often purchase myself due to lack of funds	1
Inks were not too dry or less than perfect ; were same HP quality for a better price than in a brick & mortar store .	1
This is , without question , the best type ink to use in a HP Printer ... ... ... ... .. we use nothing but HP Printers in our Home Operation .	1
Pretty good product for the money , It is handy , does the job and the solar cells work too . I like the color	1
Simple , easy to use , small enough to carry , but not so small you ca n't push the buttons ... .perfect for those needing just a standard calculator ...	1
This is a great calculator , especially since the cover is a perfect size for inserting a business card when you give them as gifts ...	1
They do the trick . I am a science teacher who needs to supply calculators so the classcan perform some basic calculations . So far everything is good .	1
This simple calculator seems to work fine , as advertized . I docked it a star because I was n't able to find a function for integrations or higher order functional analysis , but I suppose you ca n't have everything in a five dollar calculator.It also lacks voice control , has little or no artificial intelligence , and in general makes a very poor companion if you 're stuck alone with it on a desert island . It does break the ice at parties with the classic 58008 joke , but only the most sophisticated of users are able to appreciate the humor .	1
I purchased this calculator because it has solar , as a gift for my sponsored child in Africa . xxx xxxx xxxxx	1
It works fine and is easy to carry in a purse . It does n't take up any room .	1
My 4th grader was told that they could use calculators in class . She did n't like the ones provided by the school but I did n't want to spend a lot of money on something that could easily get lost or broken . She wanted a fancy , fun calculator but none of them had good reviews and she really did n't need a toy on her desk.So I picked this up for her for three reasons:1 . It has a built in cover , perfect for keeping it safe in a backpack2 . It is solar and battery powered - double the options3 . It was the perfect price at less than $ 3 ! It works well , is small enough for a desk and easy enough to read .	1
If you want a basic calculator with a cover , this is what you want . Not as compact as Aurora HC 100X , but the keypad is a little bit more comfortable .	1
This is a small and cheap calculator . The price is low and you get what you pay for . It serves its purpose and was inexpensive so I have no complaints .	1
The best thing about this calculator is that it 's got a cover that latches . No , it does n't lock , but that little hard-plastic door closes over the keypad , so when I toss it into my briefcase and head out , I do n't have to worry about damage to the keypad , or the thing being turned on and staying on as a stray pen or something just keeps pushing its buttons . The main power source is light , but it 's got a simple battery backup , the batteries being accessible when you pull two small philips-head screws from the back of the case.This thing is small and mobile , and is perfect for my mobile business needs . I 'm not going to be plotting spacecraft trajectories or formulating amino acid degradations today , so I do n't need anything more than the basic arithmetic functions it offers ( as well as % , square root and basic memory functions ) .The buttons are just the right size , not so big that I feel like this thing is a learning toy for a 2 year old , or has been made for the myopic over-70 set . The buttons are big enough that I can quickly tap out my work without mashing down multiple buttons.To conclude , if you want a small calc you can tote with you and that will not let you down by running out of power , this is the one . If you 're after a reliable little machine to crank out your daily checkbook totals or to tally up the pro-rating on your timesheet entries , then this is the one you want . Recommend .	1
Nice useful calculator . Not as nice as the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator , which I really like , it is great just the same . It has a hard case that protects the calculator from regular use or putting in one 's pocket or briefcase . It goes off when you close the case . It is a good size to use on the go or on your desk . Looking for a handy durable calculator , I think this will fit the tbill . More so , the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator will be even better . See my other review .	1
I do n't need a whole case , just a ream . I can add this to any other Amazon order and get exactly what I need . We 're a military family , so wasting some of our precious poundage on lugging around a case of paper is not an option . Great quality for our Canon inkjet/multi printer .	1
It 's hard to find a lot to say about paper . But as paper goes , this is good stuff . Clean , crisp and bright , just the right thickness . Perfect for all your printing and copying needs . Oh , and nicer-looking than the paper you steal from work . heh	1
- Solid feel but not too thick- Bright white looks good with any color ink printed on it- Cheap , price is right on amazon.com- Using it on an HP printer from 2002 with no issues whatsoever .	1
This copy paper is brighter than your run-of-the-mill copy paper and I am extremely pleased with it . Will buy again .	1
I have used this paper for a number of years . It is perfect for my printing jobs and my ink jet printer . It is bright without being too bright , has a nice weight and is neither too thin or too thick for general personal and office use . The price was right so I bought a ream ! Good purchase as far as I am concerned .	1
Paper is paper . Well not exactly . Some of the & # 34 ; stuff & # 34 ; on the market will not do your printer justice and the end product will be less than what you should expect . This paper has a good surface and goes through the printer without & # 34 ; jams & # 34 ; . It has a 96 brightness which I find excellent . While it is listed as 20 pound paper , i checked this against a cheaper packaged of 20 pound and the difference was astonishing . This is good paper at a reasonable price .	1
This is a bright white paper which is good for general printer needs . It feeds into the machine with no issues . Ink did not bleed on it . No problems here .	1
I bought this because it was the best price on Amazon 's site , when I ordered , for a single ream . The paper is as good as any other with the same weight and brightness numbers .	1
works as expected	1
This HP Multipurpose Copy/Laser/Inkjet with 96 Brightness , I was so glad to find in a local store last week . So I have been printing letters , forms , misc type of documents on it and am amazed the brightness of the paper for such a reasonable price ! And since I have an HP Printer , I am glad to have paper with HP 's endorsement ( on the back of the wrapping for this paper , it states that it was actually made by International Paper Company under license of HP ) . So this paper is made for HP and other quality types of printers , whether HP or another brand.So glad I am using this paper now as in the past , I paid for the generic and cheap types of paper that a brightness of about 88 , which is not that good when it is compared to 96 brightness . And the old generic paper cost the same price as this high quality paper.For the cost of this product and the quality , this is in my opinion a BEST BUY !	1
I ordered this paper because I knew it would be a good product since it was from HP . I received the paper in a couple days and this saved me a trip to the store to buy it .	1
Excellent for all in one documents . The paper is smooth and when printed on it shows results that are great quality .	1
3/6/12 : I just bought paper at Target and it was $ 5 for 750 sheets . Same brightness , same weight , works fine in my printer ( generic paper ) . Really look around to get good prices on paper.Original Post : Not much to say on this . It 's paper . 96 Brightness , 20 lb , letter size , 500 sheets . That said , it works great in my Canon inkjet photo printer . It never jams or crinkles .	1
I have tried this paper in all four of my printers and it works very well . I have one printer i hate because it loves to jam the paper . Well this paper has never jammed in that printer . I think this HP paper has taught my printer to behave itself . It is reasonably priced and works very good . I will keep buying it .	1
I have ordered this pack for the first time , and as usual , HP has come through once again . The price is one of the best as I 've compared to purchasing in different office supply stores . The quality is top notch . I have no complaints . Thus far , I 've already used about 50 pages & it was recently delivered . The colors are bright & no paper jams noted on my 2 printers . When I find a product this good , I will order again-and-again . Totally satisfied . Highly recommended !	1
The multipurpose Copy paper works well the the printer.My family and I are enjoying both the printer and the paper .	1
A local church needed this paper and requested it . When they received it , the church thanked me and stated how much it was needed in their offices .	1
If your looking for paper to place in an HP printer for a cheap price this is a good buy .	1
We 've used part of the first ream and the paper works great . I 'll order these again when I need them.Thank you , Jeff	1
hello , out of paper and need some the next day ? you could go to one of the big chain stores or just use the amazon services . the cost is much better here and the delivery was so fast , that we were surprised to see the package on our porch . the product is the standard hp paper , but the b/w printing from our epson artisan printer stands out when finished . 96 is perfect for everyday printing , for printing special notices and in times of actual letter writing on the computer ... colors stand out and the b/w printing is high quality . this is a great product .	1
I have seen complaints about the quality of this paper . My personal opinion the paper is fine - it is computer paper so I do n't really have high expectations . As long as it does n't jam my printer , does n't rip by touching it , and does n't smear I am happy . So far this paper does n't do anything of those things - it provides nice clean prints and I have no reason to complain .	1
That makes this my first Costco purchase . I have a one person household so a mountain of toilet paper is n't that attractive . I 'll say though , it was a bit of a shock to see Costco using Amazon . They seem to have an active site of their own.As to the paper , it is a nice bright white that I do n't have to be embarrassed using . It is the right weight to go through my laser . So , 3 to 5 stars are certainly in order . I went with the middle but could have gone higher , if & # 34 ; Loving & # 34 ; paper had a bit better connotation .	1
I have an HP printer and this paper was recommended that I use . I am always printing something or another , and this Multipurpose paper is great !	1
I like this copy paper but it is a bit expensive for draft projects . I will be using it more for the final copy of what I 'm working on , especially if it goes to other people .	1
I recently got a ream of this paper as a promotional item at a local store ; and I am very impressed . In fact , this multipurpose 96 brightness paper by Hewlett Packard gives you something to sing about ! I use this paper with my inkjet printers ; and I can use it to make signs to tape to my front door indicating to delivery people which doorbell to ring ! The paper is not expensive for all that you get ; and it almost never jams in my printer at home . Nevertheless , I always fan the paper to make sure that it does n't jam . After I fan the paper to make sure two pieces of paper are n't stuck to each other , then I place it in my inkjet printer.In addition , this paper can also be used in laser printers , copiers and plain paper fax machine . Each page is a clean cut 8 inches by 11 inches . Great ! This paper never `` goes stale , '' so stock up on it if you can catch a sale on it . Moreover , this is excellent paper that avoids ink from smearing as it is printed on the page . Great ! I do n't know what to say about the Amazon price -- as of this writing it states that this one ream package costs $ 12.88 . This is either a misprint or maybe you get more than one package for that price ; Amazon fails to clarify this . Obviously , however , you should n't be paying $ 12.88 for a single ream of paper . The price may be a misprint or it may be for more than one package ; I can not be sure . Sorry ! Use it in good health !	1
HP paper , HP ink , HP printer and HP laptops . Never had an issue with any of them and I am not about to start experimenting	1
Excellent paper for everyday printing from school work , menus , letters , purchase recites ETC ! I do like this paper but I had expectations of better higher quality paper than my stand by PrintWorks Multipurpose Paper which I buy for $ 4 . This HP paper was better but not by much not really worth $ 6. ? ? If you can get it for less than $ 6 by all means buy it .	1
this is great paper for my printer nice white prints great and is easy to work with thank you norm	1
This package of bright copy/printer paper arrived promptly and was reasonably priced . I erred in purchasing just one package instead of a whole box , oops !	1
Great quality multi-purpose paper for your home printer . Bright white . Text and pictures come out crisp .	1
This paper is excellent quality for anything you want to do with your printer . It makes a good poster , too .	1
Bought this paper again -- -perfect thickness as not to thin or thick so jammed paper has never been a issue . Also makes clear copies and the price was very good and I liked I could get it delivered right to the door rather than chase around to try and find this exact paper .	1
If you do alot of typing and want your papers to be quality than THIS is the ream to buy !	1
This is good quality paper . I use it all the time . The print comes out great on it and the paper feels nice . Great buy . The company gave me good service because I had this paper in no time .	1
Great low price for decent everyday paper . Just shop around . I was able to get this for just over $ 5.00 and no shipping charge.Does not jam.Print quality is great.Thin so you will see print on the other side but for everyday tasks this is not an issue .	1
I have no problem with this paper , works great .The price is a liitle bit hight .But still worth the price	1
After having put together several of 'put it together ' items this was about as easy as it gets . They even give directions with arrows so the pieces slide right in , a very small notch on the plastic pieces that when slid on the pole ( slowly ) you can feel snap into place , at that point the shelve will slide into place . Used a rubber mallet to get then tight .	1
easy to put together . very sturdy for what i needed it for . would recommend to anyone who needed a little extra storage area ,	1
grst kid ! ! ! Someon Nrrfd to take jack potty liked it it rolls and is study only five more wotrds one	1
I have very limited space in my home and that certainly holds true for my pantry . It 's not that I collect a lot of junk but everyday items just seem to be overflowing . I bought this cart to put outside my pantry door to hold all those items which the pantry ca n't hold . When I need to get into the pantry , I just roll the cart a foot out of the way and roll it back when I 'm done digging around in there . This cart truly makes my life so much easier.This cart is very sturdy and well built , I just LOVE it ! It rolls around easily on my tile floors and it holds lots and lots . I really did n't understand the directions on how to put it together but by just looking at the parts and the photo on the box you can easily figure it out for yourself . I 'm already thinking about buying another cart for a back closet where it will help create an organized place as well . Do n't hesitate to buy this if you need more space , it really does the trick !	1
I own two of these carts in different sizes . This one stays put in the kitchen and rotates my seasonal appliances ; for example , I bake more in the winter than in summer so it holds large glass storage containers with flour , sugar , etc . In spring and summer it will rotate to hold my breadmaker , blender for summer fruit smoothies , etc.The second cart has moved from room to room over the years holding everything from office supplies , to books , storage boxes , extra clothing in closets , etc.Assembly is relatively easy , even if you are n't very handy . It took me about fifteen minutes from start to finish and required only a rubber mallet to assist . The first attempt at assembly had things a little uneven because the plastic collars that hold the shelves at a certain height , the collars kept slipping as I would move to do the next leg . On the second try I had to `` lightly '' assemble the pieces and then firmly tap everything in place once all was set . Getting all four lightly seated worked better to have everything level at the end.My only real quibble is with the cheap casters ; when doing my research on these it came up that they can seriously scratch fine wood floors . I do n't move these around much after they 've been assigned a task so not a real big issue for me but something you may want to keep in mind if the rolling feature is important to you.These are fairly well made , pretty sturdy , and have performed well considering the budget price tag . If you have a 'Mart locally you may want to compare but Amazon is pretty competitively priced with these.Pleased with this purchase and highly recommended .	1
It is sturdy as wire shelf units go , rolls well , clean looking , It is a little shorter than my counter top and fits perfectly at the end of my base cupboards just under the lip of the counter top . I purchased it to put a berkey water purifier on or toaster oven . I do n't think it would work for the kitchen aid counter top mixer because of the vibration . I wish I would have had it when Joe was alive . I served his dinner in the den so he could watch tv during dinner . A tray on top would have eliminate the extra trips for condiments , drinks , etc . Clean up would have been so much easier too one trip back to the kitchen . It would make a great towel and toiletry unit for the bath . The shelves are adjustable . Assembly is a bit confusing . I thought I was missing the ( F ) pieces . Later I found it was pre attached . I had 8 additional pieces , that were not visible on the assembly diagram . I figured out where they go . It was great fun . If you want to use the unit separately you will need them to finish the ends . Well worth the price I will probably get another one	1
Not a cinch to put together - just so you know & # 34 ; part F & # 34 ; is IN the long tube - do n't look for it ! Just start by screwing the long tubes together - this IS step one . The rest is figure it out as you go - the instructions are n't great - but it winds up being a decent cart.Not meant to lean on , feel a LITTLE tippy - but nothing that interfere with normal functioning . There are two locking breaks on two of the wheels so you might want to note that before deciding which wheels go where .	1
This is attractive and functional . The size is perfect and assembly was a breeze . I needed a place to keep two crock pots and wooden fruit bowl . Highly recommend .	1
This is now the second Whitmor cart I 've purchased . I got it for insulation , really : putting the cart in a picture window allows light in ; yet the stuff on its shelves , blocks air flow when it 's too hot ( or cold ) . Easy to move out of the way.If you like lipped shelves , then you will like this cart . You can not install the shelving properly , lip-down : each shelf is potentially unstable if bumped . That will matter if what 's on the shelf is heavy or important . As in , a computer . For this product would otherwise be ideal for holding computers . So , I assembled the cart lip-up . HINT : do the bottom shelf first , and put the wheels on last . It 's easy to assemble , if done that way.EDIT : the first cart ( review below ) is now deployed such that an old Win98 Dell Dimension tower sits on the lowest shelf , and an HP Laserjet 4 sits on the top shelf . In between , is a shelf for paper and peripherals . The monitor sits right of the cart , in white shelving . That gives you a sense of computer station usage . Import : it 's easy to move the unit out to plug and unplug , remove paper jams , etc.Original review of the first cart , follows below . Second is substantially the same.=====On the cart , I had placed my Optiplex 780 ( SFF ) with monitor on the top shelf ; my huge Dell 8400 tower sits on the lowest shelf ; in between ( 12 '' clearance ) , are peripherals and wireless keyboards useful with either computer . It is stable , and moves well on the house carpeting . Thus I can wheel it forward for clearer viewing , getting behind to mess with cables , etc.I do n't want to lift the tower out from the lower shelf , but merely slide it . The lipping problem is solved by putting a large but relatively thin ( 1 '' ) coffee-table-sized book beneath each computer , enabling each machine to slide above the lip . It works , but is not ideal . I lined middle shelf with rubbery kitchen drawer liner , to keep air flow but mask the cords below.So only due to the lip-up shelving , is this five-star product rated four stars . If you prefer a lip-down design , get the similar-quality Seville cart here in Amazon for about the same price . I bought the Sevilles , too ( and reviewed them ) .NOTE : a computer chassis on a chrome chart will emit a vibration when on . Depends on the type of chassis . The old-fashioned tower emits almost no vibration . But a small form factor like the Dell 780 , emits a substantial hum you can feel when you touch the cart . Due to that , the above-mentioned 'book ' is more important : it nearly eliminates the vibration .	1
Very handy and nice cart . Well made . So many uses .	1
We 're using this as a printer stand for two printers . It works very well for this purpose with one on top , one on the bottom , and some storage on the bottom .	1
I got this on a timely manner . Very easy to assemble . I found that putting the wheel first and locking the plastic brackets on the last line helps . The plastic brackets are easy to take off and be replaced if you make a mistake or want to readjust the shelf size . The materials are sturdy and the wheels are a sturdy hard plastic . Great product ! I use it in my bathroom as a shelf for my toiletries .	1
I hesitated to order anything furniture-like or bulky from the internet , but I 'm glad I ordered this storage cart on a more or less daily basis . It holds heavy kitchen appliances , tons of 2-liter sodas , and every other knick knack we 've thrown at it without any bending or bowing . It 's also not rusted or gotten dingy in the way that certain chrome things do after use . Rather , it 's totally sturdy , easy to clean , and looks nice in the kitchen .	1
I needed a cart in my laundry room to hold my detergent , bleach , etc . I did n't want a basic cart rather something with a little class and that is just what I have in this little gem . It was easy to assemble , strong , and the shelves are very adjustable to accommodate all size containers . A+++	1
Super easy to put together ! Sturdy ! I love that you can put the shelves on two different ways , because I needed a flat surface for the top shelf.I highly recommend this cart over other , cheaper made ones ! UPDATE : I love my 1st one so much that I bought another for my textbooks , notebooks , bookbag , and purse ! The one in my kitchen has given me so much counter space it feels like I have a totally different kitchen !	1
Standard modular metal shelving construction , other than the lip on the shelves are inverted from their usual orientation.No idea why people are having problems assembling it , it took about 7 minutes to put together . Tips:1 . Disobey the instructions and put the wheels on first.2 . Only clip the plastic supports for one shelf at once , starting at the bottom . Add that shelf . Repeat.3 . If lifting it , do n't try to pick it up from the shelves , pick it up from the uprights . The connectors only work in compression , not in tension.The clips never look that strong , but they work very well in practice , and the same construction holds up for much larger and heavier units than this .	1
This was purchased to be used as a microwave cart . I did n't want to spend a lot of money and it was reasonably priced , which made me a little hesitant because I thought it might be flimsy.It is n't flimsy . It goes together quickly and easily and I am impressed with how sturdy it is . My microwave is 19.5 '' W x 10.5 '' H x 14 '' deep and fits perfectly on top.There is a little 1 '' rim on each shelf and the shelves can be placed with the rim up or down.I am very satisfied with this little cart - it helped me free up quite a bit of cupboard space in my tiny kitchen .	1
It is seldom that we get a chance to use such a diverse piece of handy equipment and this Whitmor Supreme Cart is simply the most versatile helper I have found in years . It is well made , sturdy , easy to use and stores almost anywhere there is sufficient space.While just recently constructing a much larger shelf system that provided the opportunity to spout some awful words , this 'tool ' ( it really is like a tool ) was a snap to put together . The instructions were adequate and with a little pre-reading and thoughtful re-reading of the instructions it came together in less than 30 minutes . It would have taken less time had I not had the assistance of our puppy inspecting each and every move while attempting to assist . ( Before I forget let me remind anyone buying one of these that a key missing part of my instructions did not include 'listen for the click ' or some other form of assistance when snapping two black shelf holders . It takes 8 shelf holders for each shelf and had I not placed a pair on each corner 's indented part of the rail and did not hear that click when the holder was seated properly the shelf would not stay put . I wish I could have worded that better but then again I wish for other things that do not happen . Take the two black pieces and just fiddle with them on the rod and move it around until you hear the click . No click ? Do not use until you hear it . The click is the key . Whew . Hush . ) Because I wanted the locking wheels on the front of the cart , I placed a piece of bright tape so I only had one choice . It was somewhat embarassing to put the locking wheels on opposite corners . By now if anyone has read this far these are such minor comments they barely deserve space ; however , if one person is assisted I 'm happy just as I am with the cart . It is handy and useful or a combination of values that we seldom receive in one unit.I highly recommend this cart and will add to my Cart Kingdom with another one later .	1
After my previous solar calculator stopped working except in strong sunlight I looked for something basic and dependable . This is it and reasonably priced , too .	1
I had to replace my trusty TI calculator after 20 years of solid service ( I bought it in high school ! ) recently when the total/equal button started to act up . It was a solar only calculator but it got the job done for years and years.I took a chance on this Sharp and I 'm pretty much hooked . By the way , the one I got does n't match the photo so while the layout and display is the same , the body and the keys are different ( more square with an aluminum body and a glass overlay over the top section where the display is ) . I actually think it looks better than the one shown.Anyway , I primarily use a calculator when doing the bills/finances and sometimes for quick calculations while working ( programming ... it 's easier to do that then actually write up some calculations in a program when the calculations are simple ) . My biggest concerns are : - Visibility ( screen and buttons need to be clear and easy to read from arms length ) - Function ( I need memory , the usual math , and things like percent and +/- minimum ) - Speed/Usability ( it should n't be slow , of course , and the button organization should n't make my life harder ) This calculator basically meet all of these challenges with an added bonus or two . The buttons and display are very clear ( I think the dark text on lighter buttons actually works better than the pictured light on dark ) and I 'm already used to tapping things out . I 'm a big guy with big fingers but the way this is laid out I never have a problem.The added bonus here is the tax and grand total features . The tax feature lets you set a tax rate and then use +Tax and -Tax buttons to quickly add tax to items ( i.e . enter 10 - > hit +Tax = > Displays 10.825 for a 8.25 % tax rate ) . Hitting it again will show you how much the tax was ( it basically toggles between the total with tax and the tax itself ) . I do n't use this feature nearly enough but if you deal with sales tax or realistically if you deal with a regular percentage ( discounts , processing fees ) that gets added or removed from a starting value , this feature 's for you.The Grand Total feature is another useful one that lets you tally up a series of calculations , like you 'd expect , so you can calculate a grand total . You hit the Grand Total button twice then for each calculation hit Grand Total again to rack it up . For example , if you 're adding up a number of items , you can multiple the quantity with the unit price and hit the tax button to get a line item total . Then hit Grand Total to add it to the overall total . Do that a few more times then when you 've hit Grand Total with the last item you 'll have your running tally . This reminds me of my TI 's parentheses function where I could do a `` sub-calculation '' while stringing together a series of calculations rather than having to jot down or hit memory add . And , sure , this is basically like using memory add ( M+ ) and memory recall ( RM ) but it feels better/easier since with a single button hit you get the add and the display of the current running total.Overall , I 'm really loving this calculator at the moment ... assuming it lasts as long , this could be my new TI for the next 20 years . It 's definitely slanted towards business and office use but it does n't have a ton of advanced features that could get in the way for personal or basic school use . It 's not a pocket calculator ( it 's almost the size of a DVD case ) though it 's light and easy to toss in a brief or backpack .	1
Before the age of checkbook register smartphone apps , I dutifully turned to this calculator to balance my checkbook . I 'd tried other calculators , but they were either too small , the keys were too close together , the display too small , or something else made them less than ideal . With this one , it stays in place on my desk , it has a large display , the buttons are laid out intuitively , it goes well with my modern decor , and it has both battery and solar power . This calculator would be good for home of business use , but would not be suitable for a student since it does not come with a case and probably would not stand up to being thrown around in a backpack , locker , or desk .	1
Really like this calculator . Big numbers , big buttons.Small tip : I glued a rubber strip to little leg on back - helped with it not sliding around my table .	1
I give this product five stars because of how easy it is to use . I like it because of how nice it is to use . I recommend this product to everybody .	1
The Epson Photo Stylus 2200 is a truly impressive photo quality inkjet printer . We recently bought a used 2200 to use in our small business for printing product pictures and custom images for retail sales on very heavy card stock . The results have been nothing short of amazing ! The main features that made this the right choice for us were : + Individual ink cartridges - saves money in the long run since you only replace the ones that are empty ( a good deal can be found hereEpson 7 Color Ink Set with Photo Black for the Stylus Photo 2200 Inkjet Printer . ) + Accepts Very Thick Card Stock - using the rear feed port+ Outstanding Prints - the output is nothing short of amazingMy only complaint is that the rollers do need to be cleaned on occasion , but good instructions are found in the user manual . Hint : if you do n't have the cleaning pad that came with the printer , use a bit of a cotton material wrapped on the thin edge of a ruler.Vista drivers ( both 32 and 64 bit ) can be downloaded from the Epson website.This is a very good printer and they can now be found for a reasonable priced on the used market ! Highly Recommended !	1
I have had my epson 2200 for ten years now , and it is still going strong . Yes , it uses a lot of ink , and yes , the ink is expensive , but the results are well worth it . I find it works better if it is used often.This is not a printer for the timid . However , if you are willing to spend the time learning about the color management , and calibrations , the unit delivers spectacular prints.I am particularly impressed with the print quality from this machine . I use the velvet fine art paper , and find the prints are extremely stable , and the colors do not fade or shift .	1
The Epson 2200 set the standard for the pro-sumer photo printer . I 've had one since 2003 and I still love it . I am a professional photographer , but I use the 2200 for many of my personal ( as opposed to professional ) projects . I work in a very modern photo studio that regularly updates its technology ; be it photo gear , computers , projectors , printers , software , etc . Yet , I often find myself using my trusty 2200 again and again . It is the versatility and simplicity that brings me back . Sure , it uses ultrachrome ink and can be configured for most papers . My personal projects tend to be heavy in black/white images and the 2200 gives a professional and consistent look to my work . I use only matte papers with the 2200 as the glazing effect produced on pearl , luster or gloss papers is distracting and unprofessional . 2200 's printers can now be acquired for a pittance . Though I have several other printers in my work flow , I might very well buy another 2200 if mine were to go down . These are a steal for hobbyists that want to play with printing professional archival black and white images .	1
Works like a champ ! ! I 'm having a lot of trouble with nonprofit groups calling to fundraise . Repeated calls to their membership offices yielded no relief and I hate to simply not give money to worthy causes in order to stop their dial-a-beggars . ( I still will give money , but I had one group calling me eight times a day ! Enough ! ! ) What 's worse is that a lot of these groups also raise money by selling the names and addresses of their donors to similar groups , so you really wind up getting a lot of calls.I got my TeleZapper for around $ 10 , installed it four days ago , and believe me , it is already paying off . A dozen calls a day from the dreaded `` toll free number '' or `` out of area '' callers have now dwindled to nearly zero . I use caller ID with mine as well , so hopefully I 'd be able to simply return a call from an organization I actually would want to speak to.I 'm leaving off one star because my Zapper is LOUD - when you pick up the phone it emits those three tones that are at the beginning of most phone company `` we 're sorry , you have reached a number that has been disconnected '' recordings , and if you 're not careful to wait a second or two before putting it to your ear it 'll blow your mind . There may be some way to turn it down , though . It 'd be swell if you could simply press a switch to make it do its thing instead of having to listen to the tones on every call , but it 's a small price to pay for freedom from incessant 800-number calls.I 'll tell you this - I 'll not be without one of these gizmos again . I could n't find any other workable options - my phone company wo n't allow customers to block calls on an individual basis . Now I can read a book or watch a program without being interrupted by fundraisers . Thanks Telezapper ! Let me know when you guys develop a program that 'll get me off the mailing lists of all the solicitors , too ... : )	1
If you 're fed up with half-wits pestering you at home in the evening , this device is a godsend . I had been receiving an average of three calls each evening , which I tried to deal with by turning down the answering machine . But I still heard the 'beep ' each time a call was received . Worse yet , some of the callers felt the need to leave a message.The TeleZapper cuts off these calls before they even get to your answering machine , or to you . There are competing products that cost less , but this one is the most effective that I 've found .	1
I used to get marketing calls almost every day with calls in the months leading up to the holidays hitting my phone both in the morning and evening.Finally I had enough of the marketing call hassle and decided to fight back . I put a TelezZapper on my Christmas & quot ; wish list & quot ; and received one as a gift . I was a little skeptical about the thing and was n't really sure if it would work but a few days after getting the unit the TeleZapper was on my phone line and I was waiting for the first telemarketer call to arrive to get zapped . I was also waiting to see if it would zap my DSL connection since it 's on the same phone line.I did n't have to wait very long . The phone rang , I picked up the receiver , and in about a second I heard the tri-tone signal , and then said `` hello '' ... the line was silent . I called out again and got no response . I just zapped my first telemarketer and it was great ! I booted up my computer to test my DSL line and it did n't skip a beat . I also checked my caller ID and it still registered numbers.Finally , something that actually seems to work ! A few things to note : Re-record your message machine to allow a 2-3 second gap at the beginning so that the Telezapper can beep and not garble the beginning of your message . Tell your friends about the device on your phone and tell them not to hang up when they hear the tones . Some of my friends just thought they got a wrong number and hung up to try again . If you 're not expecting any calls you may want the call to go to your answering machine first to get zapped and then pick up after you 're sure there 's a voice at the other end of the line . If you pick up the receiver before your answering machine picks up , wait for the tones to go off before putting the receiver to your ear -- the tones are loud.Overall this is a great little unit and it really does work with my marketing calls dropping by at least 90 % .The next thing I need to do is to place the TeleZapper on my 2nd line -- my fax line -- to get rid of all those junk faxes !	1
Our business fax # used to get several unsolicited faxes each day . NO MORE ! At 3+ cents each for paper and toner , we are saving over $ 30 PER YEAR ( and the environmental savings of ~1000 PAGES PER YEAR ! ) It does n't affect the normal operation of the fax in any way . The only `` con '' is that 1-2 per week still get through and you have to listen to those beeping tones every time there is an incoming or outgoing fax.Fair trade off.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	1
I bought my parents a telezapper back in 2000 when they first came out . It 's still going strong and the longer you have it the more effective it is as you are gradually purged from more and more databases . I recently bought two more of these , the new model TZ900 's that are now sold . I have one at my residence and at my office . The one for my house arrived and did not work . The one at my office arrived and worked for 2 months then died . There is no manual on the telezapper website nor are there any instructions included when I bough these through amazon . After much searching I found that there is a CR2032 Lithium battery inside of the new models ! ! ! ! ! Changed the battery out and they are back in business . I think that alot of these are old stock so they show up with dead or near dead batteries in them . If telezapper would put some documentation up that would help immensely . I will be adding a second unit at my office for my fax line to help weed out junk faxes soon.Anyhow , if your TZ has quit working try changing the batter . There are 2 screws on the bottom to remove . Then pull the top and bottom pieces apart and that will expose the CR2032 battery on the top of the circuit board . Slide it out and slide the new one in then button it back up .	1
This paper is unbelievably cheap , bought it for standard school supplies . My son uses it for homework , and uses his eraser extensively while doing so ! The paper is thin but it has never torn . He does only use one side , but that is his preference , and his teachers find that easier to mark too.Would definitely buy again .	1
SFI certified sourcing addresses the 90 percent of the world 's forests that are not certified . Program participants must show that the raw material in their supply chain comes from legal and responsible . As long as you are going to use paper , you might as well be responsible.I have atrocious handwriting . So atrocious that I have reverted mostly to block printing versus Script . My second problem is keeping an even line on the page . This `` Mead Filler Paper , College Ruled , 200 Sheets ( 15326 ) '' solves my mind problem . Just a note the ruling is on both sides of the page.I can not speak to bleed through on calligraphy inks ; I use a gel ball pen and there is no bleed through whatsoever.I suggest you buy several of these packs as you will be surprised how quick you go through the pages .	1
Not a lot to say about notebook paper . This is clearly lined and average weight . One of those staples everyone needs on hand .	1
This paper has a very fine grain with a smooth finish that is friendly to most any writing instrument . It is also dense enough not to allow bleed-through of liquid ink pens . With standard college ruling and three hole punch , this is a traditional choice in paper .	1
I guess I remember what these packs of paper were like when I was in school ( which was some years ago now ) . I remember them being thicker than this , but it 's not like the product I got was too thin . I saw another review saying you ca n't write on both sides of the paper with ink . I would n't go quite that far , but it is a bit & # 34 ; thinnish & # 34 ; .Still , having said that it is what it is . A pack of paper that you can put in your binder and write stuff on . It 's fine . Makes great paper airplanes , too . : )	1
There 's not much to say except this Mead paper is a useful product . I use Mead lined paper for my students so they can write notes and essays with ease . This is a good product .	1
As some have said this paper is a touch on the cheap side , it 's the sort of stuff you 'd probably just use for taking class notes which would be transcribed later if you intended to keep them . As a cheap filler paper for kids it 's not a bad idea , but anyone who 's going to do a lot of erasing could use a step up .	1
Mead provides a good basic ( cheap ) paper that will no doubt meet the needs of most high school or even college age students . However , I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day . It 's OK - nothing great - a good utilitarian option.Pricing Note ( not part of the review ) : The price as I write this review is $ 1.46 for 200 sheets of college-ruled filler paper . That is the delivered price if you are an Amazon Prime member or combine with other products to get Super Saver Shipping . Yes , Prime Members can literally buy this and have it delivered anywhere in the US - in 2 days - for $ 1.46 ! If the price is higher as you read this review you may want to consider coming back at the start of the next school season and stocking up .	1
Loved by my daughter . She filed it in a binder and used for writing lot of reports during the summer break . Reasonably thick , nice rulers and good for kids !	1
Needed HP 56 Ink Cartridge for my HP Printer as thestore in my area had sold out at the time . To myrescue logged onto amazon.com and was able to orderHP 56 ink cartridge without any problem , also greatprice . Will order again.Thanks amazon.com	1
If you have an HP machine that requires an HP 57 ink cartridge , then this is your product . The price is consistent wherever you go , but Amazon delivers to your door saving the trip for ink .	1
Any frustrations I 've experienced over my HP 5610 All In One printer were minimalized when , after opening this black ink cartridge , I found a postage paid mailer for sending the empty cartridge off to be recycled . I love HP for that .	1
Products such as these can be very convenient to purchase online . This is one of those products .	1
I always use OEM inkjet cartridges because of problems in the past . I 'll never use one of the refill cartridges again . The price here at amazon was better than I could get elsewhere	1
This is one of those cases where you get what you pay for . I tried the re-fill route , and was not at all pleased - one cartridge leaked , another worked fine for a short while then started to produce smeary text . Bit the bullet and went back to the real HP 56 cartridge ( this is for an HP all-in-one ) and have never had a problem since . Cost a bit more , but they work perfectly.Amazon has a great deal if you set it up as a regular order - lower price and free shipping . Also , do n't forget you can get $ 3 at Staples if you turn in your empty cartridges there .	1
After buying generic ink cartridges on-line at various ink cartridge suppliers and having to return them because they are dried out , I now use HP Ink Cartridges and think Amazon prices are very good . For my HP 5610 , I buy the 56 rather than the 27 black ink cartridge.Way to go Amazon !	1
I loved using this product in my school printer . I often had to buy ink myself due to lack of funds	1
Buy HP ink and never get screwed , they just work as promised , the same goes for their printers too best in the business .	1
Amazon had the best price , even better than the so-called discount retail stores I checked . The packaging and quality were excellent and it arrived in a timely manner .	1
Stick with the original , generic inks will damage your machine . The print quality is better with HP and the ink does not dry out fast in the machine .	1
This is quality , original HP Ink at its best . You must have HP ink if your want the better photo finish .	1
Presently the Amazon price for a new one , especially for customers who have Prime , is unmatched . You might save a few bucks with refurbs , but I sure have n't had much luck with them . Should you go with a refurb , be sure that you use your printer on a regular basis . They dry up faster than new ones , requiring multiple recleanings ( and wasting of the `` good '' cartridge 's ink ) and occasionally simply refusing to come back to life . If you do purchase a refurb from an Amazon vendor and are dissatisfied with its performance , do n't write reviews panning the cartridge as though it were Amazon 's or Hewlitt Packard 's fault .	1
I like that the phone is wall hangable and desktop mountable . I do n't like the fact that it does not have a digital display . If it had a digital display this would have been a 5 star phone . My mistake , I thought all phones had a digital display . Otherwise , it rings and you can talk on it : )	1
Great business phone . Has ample amplification and works great with the headset they recommend . I use it for LiveOps and it has paid for itself already .	1
Great phone , great price . I purchased to use mainly when I am not home to use with my magic jack where there is free wi-fi and also at home if I lose power . If you lose power , landline cordless phones will not work but this one will .	1
I bought this as an auxillary phone . We 've got an answering machine and a fax machine , but I needed an additional phone to be by the computer in my downstairs office and I wanted a speakerphone so when I was telecommuting I could call into meetings and listen to them without holding a receiver up to my ear.I was convinced to buy this phone by the string ( until recently aftet I placed my order ) of rave reviews for this phone , combined with the terrible reviews for so many other speakerphones that cost less.I 've only had this phone for a few days , but I can say that it is attractive and seems to be built well . I called in to work and tried out the speakerphone and it seemed to work well on both ends . I heard the other party fine and the other party did said I sounded good.I like the uncluttered controls with big number buttons and big buttons for volume and speakerphone . I did n't have to pay for a lot of features that I do n't need.This phone also has the added bonus of a headset input , so if I ever need to talk a whole lot from my home office , I could get a headset and talk while keeping both hands free . So far , so good.Postscript : It 's September of 2007 and the speaker volume is now impossible to control and the unit seems to be buzzing . I ca n't use it for conference calls anymore . I guess I 'll buy another one , but I 'll look around first.OOPS ! I forgot that this phone is powered by three AA batteries . They need to be replaced on occasion . When they start running down , the speakerphone gets squirrely . So , I replaced them and now the phone works fine .	1
I own several . They work great , high quality sound and look nice , work flawlessly . Have used them for years and years	1
For a simple no bells and whistles phone , this did the trick . There is an ability to put batteries in the thing , but I do n't know why . Just plugging it into the wall works well and I have had no complaints . This has been good for work at home jobs as well as when the electricity goes out . In a pinch , when the cordless is dead , we also use this phone .	1
as advertised and does everything it says it will . Speakerphone does a nice job.UPDATE - LOWER TO 2 STARS.After a couple months operation the speakerphone portion of the unit becomes worthless .	1
I purchased this 2 months ago ... It has worked well ( as I had expected ) . One thing would be nice to have is the ability to click on `` Speakerphone '' without lifting the handset . The documentation is not clear in this regard . I have tried different options but the only way I have been able to use the speakerphone was to first lift the handset ... I need to do some online research to see if I am missing something.Otherwise ... the product is excellent !	1
As noted in one of the reviews . The software is in great , but the fact it is powered by USB is one less chord to worry about . I recommend it to anyone interested in a cheap portable scanner . You 'll fall in love with it . Again , do n't expect too much and we pleasantly surprised.One thing I love the auto crop feature when I scan a photo it crops it in the final image . Instead of having a big white area where there was no photograph . It is cool.Peace out	1
I bought this scanner back in 2004 . I do a lot of digital art and at the time I needed a scanner that will scan in very high resolution . Resolution can get up to 1200 x 2400 dpi . Usually I only need 600 , but it 's great having the option . 4 years later I 'm still using it , and it still works perfectly . The only problem is it 's slow , and a little loud when it 's scanning . This is worse depending on how high you have the resolution set . But I wont be replacing it any time soon because for now it completely meets my needs .	1
Even if you do n't get the current rebate from Canon , this scanner is an amazing bargain.Pros ( besides the price ) : The form factor is fantastic . It 's small and light and saves desktop space , and is portable if you need that . And I really appreciate that it does n't require a power adapter : one less cable and one less plug-in . It looks attractive ( and goes very well with a PowerBook , by the way ) .Great scans . I 'm using Mac OS X and VueScan , a third party scanning software which works with a multitude of scanners , many times better than the manufacturer 's software.Acceptable speed . The speed is n't going to blow anyone away , but it certainly was n't painfully slow , especially at 300 dpi , which is all I generally need . ( Primarily digital presentations , web work , and the occasional old photograph . ) I 'm using it to replace a very expensive , but several years old HP ScanJet . The ScanJet is just taking up too much space , and is overkill for what I really need.Cons : Materials to be scanned must sit flush against the glass , so it is n't designed to scan 3 D objects , if you need that capability .	1
I read the great reviews here ( and elsewhere ) on the LiDE 30 , prompting me to buy the newer , faster 50 . I have USB 2.0 ports and wanted the better performance ? and was n't disappointed ! The 50 can scan a full 8.5x11 color image in less than 30 seconds at 300dpi , including several seconds for the scan mechanism to reposition itself afterward . The optional & quot ; preview & quot ; was so fast it was n't worth timing . My guess is 5 seconds or so for the above preview.I wo n't rehash all the nice features of this scanner since many of you have read the LiDE 30 reviews . It seems to be an LiDE 30 with impressive USB 2.0 Hi-Speed performance added . It 's also capable of generating 48bit color output and 16bit monochrome output , whereas the liDE 30 is half that , not that this is really important . 24bit is 16 million colors and 281 trillion colors is something I do n't relate to.Aside from speed , I was pleased with the space saving design and attractive & quot ; stainless steel & quot ; appearance . The scanner bed has sufficiently high edges to allow me to easily position a sheet of paper in proper alignment , without it trying to climb over the edge . A lot of human engineering went into this product ! Windows XP really loves this machine . The software installed without the slightest hiccup . This scanner is as hot-pluggable as any device could be . XP recognizes its presence and absence immediately . Even though the LiDE series requires no power source other than from the USB port ( boy do I enjoy the absence of another power brick ! ) , I prefer to remove power from the scanner when it 's not in use and it 's a snap to pull the cable from the front USB port . ( If you 're curious , the LiDE requires 498mA against the standard USB output of 500mA . Probably 10 % or less of the current draw of CCD technology scanners . ) The package comes with some impressive looking software but all I wanted to do was scan images from PaintShop Pro and Adobe Acrobat and enjoy convenience copying . There is appx . 500MB of software if you load everything but I only installed the XP Driver and the CanoScan Toolbox . I did this not because I did n't want the other software , but really to see if the scanner would be fully functional without it ( including the 4 & quot ; one-touch & quot ; buttons ) .I was glad to discover that the CanoScan Toolbox has everything that 's required to Copy , Scan to a program ( PaintShop Pro ? ) , Scan to email , and Scan to a file ( including a PDF file ) . You may like some of the other programs they offer if you want to try your hand at OCR , manage photo albums , and similar tasks . I did install the Adobe Photoshop Essentials 2.0 because I respect Adobe software and wanted to see what this entry level image editing program can do . Not counting the 95MB for Photo Essentials , the driver and Toolbox took only around 30MB or less out of the potential 500MB.The CanoScan Toolbox is very functional , impressive software . It allows you to setup 7 discrete type of scans with their unique resolutions , scan method ( color , grayscale , etc . ) , paper size , your printer , specify your pet image editing program , etc . Then , you can associate your choice of 4 of these 7 functions with any of the 4 physical buttons at the front of the scanner . Canon has preset reasonable defaults.There are a couple negatives to be aware of . CIS technology , as has been reported by some LiDE 30 users , is sensitive to the item scanned hugging the glass . This is quite true and even a thin pamphlet will produce a distorted scan , especially at page edges and corners where there 's curl . The solution is to press the lid down to flatten the page against the glass . Consider this if you do a lot of scanning from magazines and books.Another negative is my mild disappointment with the automated scan functions and single button functions -- - a bit overrated in my opinion . Scanning to a program or file creates a JPG file first and then saves it and/or gives it to the image editing program . The quality of that JPEG was not to my satisfaction and I 'd rather have the imaging program manage the scan and work with the raw scan data.PDF files can be created automatically but may be a bit bloated and can have a grayish background . This can be improved considerably by choosing & quot ; Text Enhancement & quot ; or & quot ; Black and White & quot ; as the scanning mode . If you want to create an occasional PDF file , the Toolbox can do it for you rather easily.The scanner appears to be durable . I scanned 120 8.5x11 color glossies over a 2 day period and it did n't breathe hard or make any strange sounds . It 's also pretty quiet , in my view , although a few have complained it was loud . It could easily be used in a home office environment while you 're talking on the phone.Today I called Canon 's technical support to ask some & quot ; how-to & quot ; questions . It was not toll-free but I got through very quickly and the technician was extremely courteous , knowledgeable , and generous of his time . After one year , they will continue to help but at only $ 10 an incident . Very good first impression here ! I hope you learned something about the LiDE 50 and its software and technology from this review . If you 're on the fence between Canon and another vendor , you 'd likely be happy with the LiDE series . If you 're on the fence between the LiDE 30 and 50 , you 'd save $ $ $ and probably be just as happy with the 30 if you do n't have USB 2.0 capability or plan to install a PCI USB 2.0 adapter . ( Canon explicitly supports a wide array of Adaptec adapters . ) Good luck with your decision and enjoy the Canon experience if you take the plunge .	1
I have been using the Canon LIDE 30 scanner for seven years and it continues to do an excellent job for me . It is relatively small ( measuring 10.1 x 15.1 x 1.3 inches ) , compact and light . It does not have a power transformer or cable , but gets its power from the computer via the USB cable . It will slip into my computer bag and is conveniently portable . It scans pages up to 8.5 x 11.7 inches ( not legal size ) , will scan in black and white , grayscale or color , and will scan resolutions up to 1200 x 2400 dpi . The scanning speed varies according to page size and color and resolution selection . The scanner comes with its own set of software , which gives the user the ability to control scanning quality and is not too difficult to learn . This includes a limited `` Special Edition '' copy of Scansoft OCR scanning software ; I have since bought the full copy , which I continue to update . Buttons on the front of the unit provide quick access to scan your document , print a copy , or email your document . The innovative Z-Lid also adjusts to allow scanning thick documents or books.I regularly use the scanner to copy documents , including photos , to digital files so that I do n't need to retain lots of paper . I have found it to be a great convenience and highly recommend it . Presumably its successor scanner has only gotten better.Unfortunately , Windows 7 is incompatible with this scanner , so I have kept my older Windows XP computer as a scanning station .	1
I ordered this stand thinking it would be a useful Christmas present for my daughter and son-in-law who will be spending the next year or two writing their doctoral dissertations . Unfortunately , it came in today when I needed to type a bunch from some papers so I set it up in front of my iMac . It fits between the screen and the keyboard perfectly and the tilt is adjustable so I can place it just under the screen view . I also like the elastic line guide , which I found useful in keeping my place on the pages.First , it 's great and I again I find myself asking why I do n't own more 3M stock . I will get the kids another one because I 'm keeping this longer format one for me . It allows me to place a book or 2 sheets of paper ( I can just about squeeze in a 3rd ) across the clear , flat plastic surface and easily see what I am looking at , which is a way more comfortable feat for these 50 year old eyes . Surprisingly , the clear surface appears to be high grade optical plastic and does not distort images underneath . It 's a marked improvement over those flimsy aluminum or plastic typewriter paper trays from earlier years.Second , it rates only a `` pretty good '' and not an `` Ah , ha '' from those 3M engineers . I guess it can not be helped that the stand eats up a foot of prime desk space . This is unhelpful when its use is not necessary . The design suggests it is kind of meant to be semi-permanently fixed : The feet are study with substantial weight to hold heavier papers and such which is good . BUT , I 'm going to have to be very careful -- where the feet attach to the plastic surface is flimsy , not reinforced and bond to break if occasionally moved . I guess that is why the assembly instructions tell you it takes only 30 seconds to attach the base to the feet rather than provide better detail on how to attach . So be warned , this is a handy , very useful product ; but , unless you use it continually , you will need to assemble and disassemble the parts to move it to and from your desk . I 'm keeping the packaging box for storage . At least it has a 5 year warrantee which I bet will be much used , 3M.And I 'm still buying another one for the kids ; I 'll probably break down again and get the wider format . And to other members of my family who sometimes sit at my large desk at home : `` Donna toucha the merchandize ; you break it , I cotoffa you fingar and maka cheZe outta it '' .	1
This product works exactly as you 'd expect it to , it holds your books up with no fuss . The setup was pretty simply despite the truly atrocious instructions ( the pictures do n't even make any sense ) and it seems sturdy enough to last many years.If someone gave me this product for $ 15 , even $ 20 , I would be impressed and recommend it to everyone I know . But the asking price here ( the MSRP is over a hundred bucks ! ! ! ) is just out of control . It 's so ridiculous that I found myself searching for some hidden feature ( built-in LED lights , diamond encrusted accessories ) that could possibly make it worth that much.Long story short : Great product , but you 'd have to be out of your mind to pay this much for plastic .	1
I got this looking for a simple copy holder ... I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is ! It has a large footprint and it 's got a significant weight to it ... it really will hold up to 300 sheets ! I do find that for some reason , the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use , so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things ( as I mentioned , it 's rather large ) , you run the risk of losing that cord .	1
I got this product for my wife who was complaining about losing her place in cookbooks while working . It has worked great ! She is able to put her largest cookbooks , or 3-ring binders , or loose sheets on this holder , and with the elastic strap she never loses her spot . The holder has n't tipped over , with heavy books . Keeping the books upright also makes following the recipes easier . It does take up some space , but fits above our cabinets , but it could be a concern for some .	1
Overall , I believe this copy holder to be a good product.Pros*Good looking ( although it will most likely be hidden behind copy or a book*Holds books flat ( due to elastic band , and bottom lip ) *wide enough for to hold two 8 1/2 x 11's*very sturdy ( due to the heavy base ) Cons*Seems the clear plastic could break ( also due to the heavy base ) *adjusting the angle is not as easy/accurate as it should beAlso of note : this wo n't work well as a cookbook holder because there is no splash guard for the books	1
On paper this copy holder is a great idea , and with the 3M brand you know it is a quality product . This copy holder helps you keep a book in a slanted upright position so that you can refer to it easily . Thanks to the extra heavy base , it can really be any book , including a dictionary . The elastic band keeps the book open and can serve as a line guide . So what 's not to like ? It turns out that in everyday use , I start to grow tired of it . First it is the size . 18 inch is REALLY big , which is great if you need to hold a book open or have two sheets of letter-sized paper side-by-side . But when the holder is empty , it 's really quite noticeable if left in front of the monitor . Fine , I will remove it when empty . But the base is heavy , and the holder is not easily collapsible . ( Both of these are in fact PROS in my mind . ) There are a CONS . The elastic band that holds the book open is not easily adjustable if you only want to use one hand . It also seems that this elastic band is the weakest component and will surely break the earliest . But it 's hard to tell how long it will hold.Overall , I would say that this is great if you need an industrial grade copy holder on a regular basis , with regular being the keyword here .	1
This was very easy to set up though it was one of those rare occasions when the pictures were not very useful at all . Basically you just need to open the dials on the base parts so you can fit the clear plastic part in . It is easier if you figure out the approximate tilt and height you will need for the clear plastic part that supports your written materials before you tighten up the sides but it is fairly amenable to change . If you are even a little fanatical about all things being exactly even , it will cause you to get out a spirit level because otherwise you will fuss at it for awhile.I work from home and use a variety of research books , some of which are quite large well over the 300 page limit of this page holder ; however , if the book fits in the bottom lip , the holder will support it . I have a roll top desk so by using a variety of heights and drawers , I am able to keep three laptops working at the same time , as well as having four to five research books open . This opened a whole new level for me in a space that was largely wasted.I really liked the way I was able to get this to drop an open book at sight level between the top shelf and the desktop surface of my desk . It created a level 1 which is incredibly useful.This is also sturdy . I have several bookholders , one even fashioned by a metal working friend who noticed that I needed something sturdier for some of my books while she was in my office . The only advantage over those are that I am able to use clips to hold books open as well as magnets to keep notes in place . The base on this is able to keep the entire unit as stable as the metal book holders but obviously not hold notes with magnets . Not a serious problem although I expect I will be using clips on it shortly enough.There are two flaws that bother me . The clear plastic itself : it 's like waiting for a ding on a new car . You want to get it over with so you can go back to being free and easy . Yes , I 'm still waiting for the first scratch so I do n't have to be careful anymore . Understandably this is a strength and a flaw . The other is that even when I am using books under 300 pages , one side of the base pieces sometimes tilts . If it comes down , everything on my desk comes down with it . If the bases were a little heavier , that would make it an even better product .	1
1 . This is a very nice looking , well designed product . It 's simply to assemble , it 's easy to adjust and performs the task for which it was intended . I 'm not sure sure or keen on the elastic cord in the sense that I 'm not sure how long it 's going to last , but so far so good.2 . The only issue folks have to consider prior to purchasing this product is whether they have the desktop space for it . Review the dimensions ; it may be bigger than you think .	1
PROSSturdy and somewhat heavy weight.It 's going to hold open most books . Which is what you want.Does n't cover the bottom of book like some book holders . Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt 's definitely big and a bit deep , so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk . It needs to be as wide as most hardcover textbook/cookbooks . Unlike some book holders , there is no book overhang over the edge , due to the design.The bottom hinges are a little weak . Like it can too easily fold in on itself . But it has n't been a problem and can be fixed each time.I wish it DID fold up easily and was more easily adjustable.I wish it had an extra band in case this one gets broken or lost .	1
3M has long been known for their series of office products from the postit note to gizmos like this . The copyholder allows you to place a reference book , printout , or other material for use in writing a thesis , etc . The bar allows you to hold your place while working on your computer.The heft and weight of the aparatus is sufficient to hold heavy books or large printouts without tipping over or loosing your place.Years ago , prior to the advent of the xerox machine , a copyholder was an essential desktop aparatus since administrative staff used typewriters and carbon paper to reproduce the original document placed in the copyholder . Today we write documents on computers and include captions from books . Another useful feature is organization - all paper documents ( statements , bills , etc ) can be stacked in the copyholder to pay bills using online banking . This version can also hold electronic devices next to your pc ( Ipad , etc ) for easy transfer of data between your ipod and your pc.while not cheap , the 3M version is well built and will last a long time	1
This thing is HUGE . You can keep two sheets of paper next to each other and consult both . You ca n't keep it under the monitor unless your monitor is really high up , and keeping the monitor that high would be really uncomfortable for most people . Measure that you have the space for it , and are willing to give up that much desk real estate . If so , and if you want that size , it 's very nice.The lean is adjustable to any angle you want . The ledge is enormous . I think the 300 sheet capacity is a little underestimated . You could push it to hold more than that . It will hold a huge cookbook open to your page . It 'll hold an unabridged dictionary . I put my Kindle DX on it , and it sits there nicely so I can knit and read at the same time.It 's strong . It has a cord to hold the papers even if you 've got a fan going nearby . It 's perfect , if you need something that big.The main reason it gets four starts not five is that it comes disassembled for no obvious reason , and the instructions are poor , so it 's a pain to assemble . When I assembled it , it fit in the box anyway , so there was no reason not to ship it in one piece . The cord comes in a bag that 's inside a bigger bag.Overall , it 's fabulous for the kind of workspace that can support a supersized document holder , and excessive for a more modest sized desk .	1
I rate this as a very useful concept but somewhat poor design . The legs are too week and they wobble when you move the item as a whole . Also occasionally , the weight of the book at a certain angle causes the unit to slowly collapse and late flat . As long as you dont overdue the weight of the book and the angle , this is a very nice holder .	1
Install took a few minutes , use is as easy as one could hope.I 've bought about 3-4 different copy holders , each collecting dust in my closet due to their limited usefulness ( no matter the price ) .This is the first one I 've gotten that works how I want where I want when I want.I can have a large text book open and it 'll keep the page open , it 'll also work with a smaller paperback book.Mostly I use it to reference my journals ( a job that this handles perfectly ) as well as other material I print and keep out for reference.By having the strap across the unit you can keep your pages open and it 's really easy to change pages.It does n't get in the way at all , and I rarely move it . Position it for a book , and keep it there , easy to change pages , easy to remove the book and put another one in it 's place.For my needs there could be no better design . I 've given up trying to find one that works , then I got sent this wonderful device.A truly beautiful specimen . Functional in every way . 5 Stars , do n't waste your time with other holders . Not to mention this one looks quite classy in my room.I 've used this on my desk , in the kitchen , in the floor , and even on my couch . I love it and ca n't recommend it enough .	1
I was n't sure how excited you could get about a `` copy holder '' , but I had a chance to try it out so I took it . Let me tell you . This thing works great for 2 things.1 . Holding cookbooks in the kitchen , did an amazing job holding the cookbook at the right angle to see the recipes.2 . Holding an iPad ! I actually used this copy holder once in the kitchen , it worked well and perhaps it will make a trip back to the kitchen sometime soon . But I now use this mainly in my spare room which I turned into a little exercise room . I have a bike and elliptical machine and never really had a way to stand my iPad up good so I could watch podcasts or movies while working out . This thing fits perfectly on a TV tray or tabletop and holds the iPad perfectly . I know it was n't designed for this , but it works great ! Overall I 'm really happy with this . I 'm not so sure about the construction of it , I think they could have designed it better , but once you assemble it the stand is pretty sturdy and I have no fears about using it . I 'm glad I got this as it 's proven to be very useful for me .	1
This is a hefty piece of equipment that will take up some prime real estate on your desk , but it works great to hold those books in place while you 're working ! It took less than five minutes to assemble it , and is easy to use . Because it 's so large , it 's great to hold heavy books in place , but will also accommodate smaller texts like novels or even small stacks of papers.The legs on mine are a bit wobbly , which is why I 'm downgrading my review a bit . ( We 've tried tightening them , but it has n't helped . ) Overall , I love this thing ! I 've been storing it on the floor under my desk when I do n't use it so it does n't take up too much desk space , and it 's worked great so far . For years ( all throughout graduate school , up until now ) , I 've been using this cheap little metal holder that was a pain to work with . This 3M product is really fantastic , and I wish I had gotten one of these years ago !	1
The 3M ( TM ) Copy Holder , In-line , 18 Inches Wide , 300 Sheet Capacity , is meant to be used for holding documents and books while using the computer . But , I 'm thinking it would prove handy for booklovers who had to curtail their book reading because they could n't hold the book comfortably , for whatever reason . This stand is on the large side . The copy holder will take up about 12 '' space lengthwise & is 18 '' wide , but that means most books & magazines can be open so both pages show at once . It fits on our TV trays . My mother-in-law was an avid reader , but had to give it up because of hand tremors . How can you read when the book or magazine you 're holding is in constant motion ? This copy holder would have been perfect for her . It might even work in a hospital setting & could be used on the tray to set up for the bed-bound patient . Of course , I ca n't be sure of this without trying it.I will use the DH640 when I crochet , to follow along in instruction manuals , at the PC to hold documents & books , & once in a while to hold a thick , heavy book that I 'm reading . The elastic band reminds me of my daughter 's elastic head wraps , and is adjustable up & down for books/documents of all lengths . Being elastic means it can hold different thicknesses from a single page document , thin magazine to a thick manual . I tested it with a 700 page cookbook & had no problems with it . I also put a 4 pound box of canned dog food on it ( to test for weight ) & it held nicely as long as the copy holder 's tray/base ( the piece that holds the book/document ) was on the table . I 'm not sure how long the threads will last as everything is plastic but the screw.There is a 5-year limited warranty which does not include normal wear & tear .	1
First , I must say that I can not rate a product on it 's price , but this is really tough as the list price is just unacceptable . Possibly worth about 1/4 of that . But , it 's does it 's job.There truly is not much to setup or even part of this unit that is more exciting that telling you it 's a piece of lucite with sand filled plastic legs and a rubber band . You can use it for large books and magazines . Great for data entry projects and stacks of items to merge etc . But , if any change should be made , it 's the rubber band . Why could this not be thin elastic belt ? The rubber band leaves creases and could tear pages , so make sure it is adjusted for each use.Due to the weight and sturdiness , I have found myself using this a bit more creatively . It works perfectly propping my fully opened netbook with the rubber band in the hinge area , creating a safe upright keyboard and screen . This has been useful on the side table near the tv . But , this is meant for office related items , but plan on it taking up space . It will end up being like that kitchen appliance stuff in the cabinets because it 's too big and annoying to pull out to use . But if you are in need of such an item as your primary use on your desk , then this is a welcomed addition , I am sure.If the item were a bit more attractive , I would suggest displaying an open book in the living room or something like that . Possibly songbooks for the piano . Christmas books . A large Bible . There are certainly a lot of possibilities , but the design is more technical and useful rather than a decorative accessory.If you are doing a lot of data entry , and will do so for quite a while , then it 's a wise investment . But it 's disturbing to call it an investment for something so basic .	1
I teach and my students are always amazed at how fast I type . I 've been typing since I was in high school about 25 years ago . I 'm very capable of copying what I 'm reading from so I have used copy holders before and was , quite honestly , looking for something to not only use with books and papers but to also house my new iPad . Well I got it . Not only can I use this copy holder with books and papers and my iPad , heck , I can do it all at one time ! I must not have been looking at the description and focusing on the details of 300 sheet capacity as well as 18 inches wide . I was expecting something a little bit more portable and smaller . I was wrong . The picture really does n't capture the size of this thing . It 's HUGE ! You can almost open two books and open them side by side with a little bit of overlap.The legs are heavy so you do n't have to worry about anything tipping over . The pages can be held back by a stretchy item which I like better than something that is rigid and plastic . There was supposed to be something else in the box like a mounting pad but it was missing.I gave it four stars because I feel the back should be a wee bit taller for sheets of paper that need more support . It also takes up a lot of space . While I have a nice sized desk it 's taken up by a lot of other items . I plan on moving things around to make room for it though.It is expensive and the quality is well worth the price .	1
While not being familiar with the rest of the market , I am impressed by this product . It is like the metal book holders which I have used before , the ones that keep the pages open . But it works with documents . For a researcher , this is a helpful tool in order to type commentary at the computer while retaining the documents vertically . Set up is simple . The only problem is that the string keeping the documents in place sometimes is liable to come loose . Other than that , I really like it .	1
I must confess , I got this item intending to break it ( the joy of the Amazon Vines program ) .Unlike other copy holders I 've used , which have a sturdy metal or wooden edge on the flat part , this holder only has a molded channel on the flat for the legs to clamp onto . This no doubt saved a tremendous amount in production costs ( and lets the legs be attached in more than one place ) , but given the geometry of the item , I could n't believe the holder would n't break if one of the legs was bent inward.I was wrong - the holder is designed so that the legs come off if they are bent inward or outward ( for example , if the holder slips or is dropped ) . I 'm not saying the item is unbreakable ( it 's not titanium ) , but it 's far more sturdy than it looks.Pros and cons -- It 's wide enough to hold a typical magazine , or a stack of 11x17 sheets placed horizontally , but this also means it takes up a lot of desk or counter space- There 's an elastic band to hold the pages open , and mark a line , but this wo n't work if the copy hangs over the sides- The angle is completely adjustable- The legs are weighted to provide stability- The legs can attach anywhere on the sides of the flat , so the holder can hang off the edge of a shelf or counter , but it therefore may take a bit of fussing to get the legs even- The tray at the bottom ( which would support the bottom of the copy ) is slightly over an inch deep , so this is n't going to work for a big book like a bible.For cookbooks and cooking magazines , which is what I got it for , this holder is excellent , if a little industrial looking . It will also work well with 11x17 paper , as long as it 's in landscape mode .	1
This is a good product that works but the poor instruction manual made it hard to assemble . I actually had to call 3M to make sure I assembled it correctly and I have used a number of document holders in the past . Also there are some great design features that are marred but some not so great design features.The good and bad : I called 3M and they have great customer service . This is good . The bad thing is I had to call them because the instruction manual is just three doubel sided sheets of paper listing diagrams on how to put together three types of document holders with some safety and warranty information and a parts list thrown in . The manual , which is written in four languages , fails to use any words to explain how to attach the base or line guide . If you bother to create a manual in four languages , some words describing how to put the holder together or the best way to use it would have been very helpful.The base , which is really two `` legs '' , is heavy . This is good since you can use large documents with this and it is important to have the weight to hold it steady . Unfortunately , after I slid the two `` legs '' into a groove on each side of the document holder and screwed them in I found they moved when I have moved the document holder . Perhaps then need to be tighter.You can change the angle of the legs if you want to change the angle of the document holder . This is good . The problem is since the legs are not connected to each other you have to make sure you angle each evenly or the holder will be wobbly.One good thing is after you figure how to put this together it is easy to take apart for storage . My desk space is limited and this is large so I have taken it apart and reassembled it on a couple of occasions.Conclusion : If you are looking for a large document holder , this will do the trick once you have it assembled and in one place . It worked well when it was holding some fairly large documents . The legs are heavy which is good . I also like the fact that I can take it apart and not add to the clutter in my office . It is wobbly though if you move it around . Also the instruction manual is poorly designed .	1
The 3m Copy Holder is useful in a variety of ways . It 's good for the student who needs to type up his or her notes from classes . Or the office worker who needs a place to hold papers . The copy holder is 18 '' wide and is sturdy enough to hold up to 300 sheets of thick paper , catalogs , books , and more . The copy hold fits perfectly on most desks or tables and is designed to be positioned directly between your computer monitor and keyboard , however it will easily fit anywhere . It also has an elastic cord that stretches across to hold your documents in place . Overall this a very handy office tool and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs it .	1
This copy holder is great ! I plan on using it to hold my recipe books while I 'm cooking and to hold and keep my place on knitting patterns/charts while knitting.I have the 18 '' size and it easily holds a large five pound book ( I used Martha Stewart 's Cooking School ) . It fit perfectly , held the pages open well , and despite the clever design feature of being able to tilt the ( for lack of a better term ) book holder back or forward , the book stayed exactly where I put it.This has plenty of great features and usability but here 's why I ca n't give it 5 stars . The pieces seem slightly flimsier than I 'd have expected and wonder how much of a beating this thing can take , but with care I think ( hope ) it could last quite a while . I am a little afraid of over-tightening the knobs on the sides that keep the clear piece from moving back/forward . The instructions are virtually useless ( the sketches are horribly undetailed and not close enough too see anything , with little in the way of description ) but fortunately the piece are simply-designed enough so that a quick once-over will allow you to put two and two together.Overall I think this is a great product and would recommend it for several reasons and for several uses . One thing to remember , though : keep the box it comes in ! It 's a great way to store the holder when it 's not in use . It 's a pretty heavy and awkwardly shaped thing to keep set-up all the time unless it 's always being used .	1
This item arrived broken . The clear plastic part that acts as a book rest was cracked along the right hand side in two places . It had been wrapped up in cellophane wrap ( like Saran Wrap ) and then put in a plastic bag . Unfortunately the parts that were broken were rather crucial to its function on the bottom right hand side for tightening.The `` legs '' that hold the clear plastic part weigh about 1 to 2 pounds each , which offers adequate counter balance/support for most books or papers . They rattle , which indicates there is something inside akin to beans or ball bearings , to act as ballast.it comes with one `` bungee '' cord for putting across the book to hold it open . You can adjust its length to adjust the tension.As usual , I promptly lost the instructions showing how to put it together , so I had to figure it out myself . Looking at pictures of it on the internet helped ! Took me about 15 minutes to get it put together.It is about 18 inches across , and about 11 inches high at its highest point . the tray is about an inch deep , so if you have a book thicker than 2 inches , it 's not going to hold that well.Since the one I received was broken , I ca n't really comment on how sturdy it is . It looks like it cost all of about $ 10 for the company to make.I like that I can adjust the tray up and down , as well as tilt it forward and backward . It 's a good concept .	1
First of all , I LOVE this product . It is well-consructed . It uses quality material . It is a great size for most books , and it just looks beautifully professional on my desk.It tils back easily so you can read at a couple of angles . However , as useful as the ledge on the bottom is for stopping the book from slipping off , it also makes page turning difficult because it can not be removed nor is it mobile.The base/legs can not be set in a perfectly straight angle , but that 's probably just me being anal .	1
Holding a large recipe book up while cooking or holding up a stack of documents I can peel off easily and quickly while I key info into a computer is not something I do all the time . But when I do these things , I really want the right tool to do this . I 've had a number of occasions in the past where I 've had to rig something for entering data , this copy holder would have been perfect . Same thing for cookbooks ... annoys the heck out of me to prop up a large cookbook and weigh the pages down so they wo n't turn ( not that I cook all that often , but when I do I 'd rather focus on cooking and not figuring mucking about with the book ) .While this product is huge , it is what is needed for large cookbooks . The legs on this are pretty heavy and it makes this copy holder awkward to move around easily . If you leave this item on your desk or table , it will take up a large amount of space and is not easy to move about.For me , this is something that I will end up storing in another room and pulling out when needed . As such , I am very pleased with this holder and glad to have it as a go to tool when needed .	1
I chose 3M 's 18 inch wide copy holder because I generally spend at least a couple of hours a day doing research , gathering notes either from books or online sources . If it 's online , I usually print out the info and highlight the bits I need . With the copy holder , I just slip the marked-up pages behind the elastic cord that keeps everything in place and type away . Sure , this holder is overkill for that , but even if that 's all I did , I 'd still want it : I forgot what it was like not having a cat constantly trying to sit on a flat piece of paper.But it is n't just that . The holder holds books - several small open ones at once if I need it . It 's also easy to turn the pages as I complete my transcriptions.And finally , I 'm going to be working on new editions of several of my novels and the only way to work on a manuscript - to make changes that are more than grammatical fixes - is to work off a printed-out manuscript . I expect I 'll be ready to worship the copy holder once I get into that phase of work.The copy holder is designed to sit between keyboard and monitor , but I only use a laptop . I also prefer to do most of my writing on a huge tall coffee table in my living room , so I simply set the big , heavy copy holder up there . It works great next to the computer , or even slightly behind it.We 've found the holder is also great for holding recipes in the kitchen and it now doubles as a heavy-duty music stand on my piano . It 's great ! No more falling music books ! Overall , this is n't a very portable copy holder and it takes up a lot of space , though the clear Lucite keeps it from looking as bulky as it is . For me , it 's worth every inch it eats - and since it 's clear , it does n't look as bulky as it is . I love it !	1
I guess I really did n't realize just how big this thing is . Sure it gives the dimensions , but being able to open up a magazine or a small book and rest it on this holder is pretty great . There is also enough room for a couple of separate sheets to view side by side . The clear plastic seems sturdy enough , but I have concerns about the black legs , or more precisely , the area where the legs attach to the larger piece . That thin black piece seems prone to breakage . It has NOT happened yet , and I do n't see this happening under regular use , but if you move this thing and the legs , which are heavy and wobble when moved attached , snagged on something , I really think you 'll lose it.Despite its size , the copy holder is pretty well designed to be unobtrusive and sits fairly well on my desk , mostly out of the way . Depending on how your desk it designed , mine has some cubby space where the legs slip in for example , you may or may not have room to keep this thing out of your way.Now the only thing I absolutely hate about this thing the line guide . Just think about what happens when you accidently snap a rubber band . I pull on it a bit and one side , always the right side , slips free and snaps . It 's so prone to this that just adjusting the holder or moving it causes it to come lose . It 's really the only complaint I have about the copy holder at this point.If you have a need for a copy holder , I 've seen worse , and this really is n't too bad and I think the main piece is going to hold up pretty well actually .	1
This is a very useful product . It holds items such as books , papers , and it can even be used as an art easel ! The leg arrangement makes it a bit bulky and awkward to move around -- but it is also the unique leg arrangement that allows it to be adjusted in so many ways and the weight of the legs is what keeps it sturdy . I like the clear plastic backing which actually creates a very clean , contemporary , and lightweight appearance.Bottomline : Great item if you do n't need to move it around a lot !	1
When I got this I really did n't appreciate how much real estate an 18 '' item would take . The footprint is large - at least a foot behind the holder too so you 're losing a lot of desk area once it 's together and in place . I kind of wish it was smaller maybe with pocket eaves at the ends that could be pulled out to increase the horizontal width of the holder . This way it could still retain a large opened book but be reduced for smaller documents and paper . I know 3M sell a smaller version of this holder but I think it could have been engineered in such a way that one size fits all . Do keep in mind that this is a very big document holder ; take the time to measure an area at least 20 '' x15 '' to one side of your monitor to establish if you have room for it . 3M 's brag of it sitting between your monitor and keyboard really does n't ring true with today 's flatscreen monitors . My 28 '' screen is a mere two inches off the desk so this item would block the view to about 50 % of my screen if I placed it there.Still if you do need a document holder this vast that does the job right then this is it ! Assembly took no time and once together you know this thing is n't going to move or fall over . I placed ream of paper on it ( more than the recommended amount of pages ) and it withstood the weight without folding in on itself . So it works and works well - the band which holds the pages open is useful although flimsy.If you 're currently propping up a book by leaning it against a pile of other books then you should treat yourself to the 3M Copy Holder . It 's more than big and strong enough for the job and fairly priced .	1
Easy to assemble ! ! Sturdy ! ! Works very well . I thought the clear plastic was a good idea.. With it , you do n't really need to remove the item to see your Computer screen . It seems to be of very good quality . I did n't give it another star 'cause I wished it would have been a bit easier to remove when needed . It kind of `` bends in the middle '' when moving it . But , all in all a handy item to have around .	1
Apple keyboard gets dirty , wether you want it or not , and it is nice every so often to clean them and leave them looking without blemishes . This product , the 3M Keyboard Cleaner Kit has the capability to do the job . 4 Stars .	1
I have used lots of keyboard cleaning products . I ordered this one when I saw it looking for something else . It works better than all the others , mainly due to its unique shape .	1
This product is simply amazing and so easy to work . I had neglected my mac keyboard at work for a while and it had accumulated quite a bit of gunk on the keys . It took just about a minute or so of cleaning with this kit . Drop the cleaning solution on to the provided sponge brush , do some circular motions on the keyboard - you 'll see it getting cleaned right away . I did n't have to use the 'side ' brushes , but can see how useful it would be on a windows keyboard with deeper keys .	1
With a toddler who likes to play on the computer and the keys get sticky . It gets the keys non sticky .	1
This is the one . This is the first all-in-one keyboard cleaning kit I have ever used that really delivers . The instructions are clear and the tools are high quality . After using the cleaner for the first time I was amazed that my keyboard ( a Logitech ergonomic ) looked and felt brand new after I had used dirty fingers to pound out thousands of pages on it . Do n't even bother with searching for another kit . There is one thing though . There should be about twice as much of the cleaning solution provided .	1
A mere .5oz of precious fluid that you will need to evaluate yourself before arriving at a determination of `` fair value . '' You can purchase even smaller bottles of fluid costing upwards of fifty dollars for one-time cleaning of a phonograph stylus . Audiophiles may swear by some of these esoteric liquids , while the rest of us achieve the same results with water and isopropyl alcohol at virtually no cost.In the case of this 3M cleaner the fluid is stronger than rubbing alcohol -- it has a faint aroma of cigarette lighter fluid ( butane ) and is actually sticky to the fingers until completely dry . Nevertheless , it 's undeniably effective . Squeeze a few drops on to the middle of the included bizarre-looking pad ( a bright-red miniature werewolf shape ) , rub it across your keys , and you 'll notice dirt disappear along with gummy residue . In fact , it freed up a `` stuck '' spacing bar on my Apple `` Magic '' keyboard.The `` werewolf '' has pointed ears intended for use when cleaning individual keys . But the instrument would be more practical if 3M had designed it with a single head with two pointed ears ( i.e . cleaning tips ) rather than placing a head at each end of the pad -- 2 identical heads with 4 identical ears . The user is instructed to place drops of the limited fluid on each of 2 ears for such detailed cleaning , but upon doing so there 's no visible way of discerning which end of the pad ( or which `` werewolf head '' ) has been annointed with the precious potion.This is an instance where 2 heads definitely are NOT better than one .	1
I did n't know they made such a product . The two sided sponge double tips fit neatly around each key . The liquid does its job nicely . The soft cloth dampened with the liquid cleaner polishes the tops of the keys . I had no idea now dirty the area around my keys had become . This product is from 3M , a quality company .	1
I have owned my computer for four years , and though I dust all the time , I 've neglected the deep cleaning of my keyboard almost completely . It was n't the worst-looking thing ever , but being a black keyboard , it shows every speck of dust , hair , etc . I do eat breakfast at my computer every morning , so crumbs do occasionally become a part of my keyboard 's life . I took the major keys off & cleaned the inside & bigger pieces completely , but I needed something to get in between all of the crevices . I tried Q-Tips & other stuff , but nothing ever really did the trick . This did everything I was looking for.This is designed really well . The scrub side , with several drops of the included cleaner on it , got my mouse & keys `` exfoliated '' . I cleaned in between all the keys with the red ends of the scrubber , which I 'd also doused w/ some more included cleaning fluid . That left it looking great . I finally wiped it all down w/ the included cloths & it basically looks brand-new . In between the keys was so bad it left the red cleaning points a charcoal grey by the end ! For the completely anal-retentive like me , having dust anywhere is a major annoyance . Now I know what to buy to get this maddening chore over with . Just wish I 'd discovered it sooner ! I 'd prefer this to be sold in bulk , because while there 's cleaning fluid left over , the ends of the scrubber are blackened by dirt & I really do n't want to use them again . Honestly , I 'd rather buy a package of four or something , have a slightly bigger container of the cleaning fluid and more cloths- less wasteful packaging that way , too . I 'm dropping a star for packaging only- the product itself is fantastic .	1
I was looking for cleaner for keyboard and tried this one . It is good cleaner but not as I hope for . It only does the clean on surface ( top ) and not inside so I had to use something else for inside but this is good for surface only .	1
We used these to label client CD 's before we ship them . We add our logo and and some custom text and it works great . We used roxio disc label maker or something to actually print the items but this paper was very good . No smudging or any issues like that . The adhesive stuck very well to the CD 's . It is a little difficult to line them up correctly at first but eventually you get the hang of it .	1
Came with a total of 300 and the quality is very high ! does not get much better than this . I would recommend .	1
I have been using these labels for several months now for DVD 's I have recorded for public access television . The labels work just great and are much less expensive than what I can get at an office supply store . Highly recommend .	1
I find this product of Memorex labels to be what I wanted at a very reasonable price . The value for what it cost surpass that which if attempted to by at an office store locally can not compare .	1
Reasonably high contrast , vivid , uniformly strong adhesive , and smooth matte paper finish . Very good design and quality for the money . Probably the best labels I have used in years .	1
I keep buying the 300 packs every time I run out . They have printed , stuck , and look great on both my CDs and DVDs . I use the inside small ones for several categories , like vacations and backups . I use the large ones for music lists of albums . So I end up getting 600 discs worth out of each package . I much prefer labeling this way rather than using Lightscribe .	1
I have ordered these before , this is a repeat , so i guess repetition begets acceptance . They are a good buy , very good quality and work well with my SureThing Disc Labeler program .	1
Half the price of the Avery or similar products . Heavy duty , handles the printer well , and does what it 's supposed to do .	1
I use this product on a weekly basis and these labels have never let me down . Top quality . Highly recommend .	1
Great labels ! Use them for work daily .	1
... permitting some automation to overcome the drudgery of addressing cards.I keep a master address list ( using Microsoft Access ) and using the Access & # 34 ; Labels & # 34 ; functions to print directly to these labels.We typically send around 120 cards . If addressing each by hand takes a minute , then this returns more than two hours of time during the press of the holidays.What 's not to like about that ?	1
The key claim of these labels is that when you are ready to `` peel and stick '' them after printing , they are easier to peel off of the backing ( the slick sheet that they come on ) than other brands are . It 's true -- they have simply removed a little bit of paper between each column of labels so that you can fold back the backing paper and easily grasp the edge of each label.If you find existing labels easy to peel off , as I do , there 's no reason to get these labels . But if you have to handle hundreds or thousands of labels in a row , the little extra convenience may be worth it.I rated them 4 stars rather than 5 stars only because there is nothing amazing about them .	1
I 've used a lot of these labels by different brands . The generic ones seem to have thinner paper , and lack the nice easy peel edge these have . Two brand-name labels are my favorite , and these are one of them . The price either way is the same , and buying in the big box saves money if you use many of these.Like : - Quality paper ; adhesive stays to paper , not backing.- Easy peel edge . Tried some without this feature , and really missed it . We use these many at a time so any time saver is huge.- Value . 3000 labels makes them near a penny each .	1
These are quality labels and in all my time using them I 've never had one jam nor smudge ( as advertised ) . However I never have had a problem with my labels jamming or smudging so I do n't necessarily see how these specific labels are superior in any sense from other , possibly even off-brand labels .	1
These labels are the same that you 'll be able to get in any big office box store , but cost much less ! There 's not much to say about them - they 're exactly as you would get in any other store .	1
These `` easy peel '' labels really are easier to peel . I bought these as a replacement to some generic Office Depot brand labels , and these Avery brand labels are worth the additional money . The labels print much more clearly , print easier , and are easier to peel .	1
My company uses over 50,000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them . These stickers are top quality in every respect . They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems . The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers . The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond , but will pull off . It appears they are designed to do this . I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect . However , in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us . You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you .	1
I love labels , or anything that makes life easier . I am very organized , both at work and at home . Labels make things so much more convenient and quicker.I love these labels . They do n't necessarily have to be used with a printer - they can be written on . And the reason I say this , is because these labels are for Laser Printers , and I have ink jet printers . Therefore , I can still use these , because I can write on them rather than running them through the printer.There are a variety of uses for labels . In addition to addresses , files , and other office reasons , they can be used for jars , boxes , etc.Awesome product .	1
You know when you are buying an Avery product , that it is going to work great and be compatible for most types of software .	1
I like Avery poducts . These are no exception . High quality and perform as expected . It should be obvious from the size , but these are not the biggest labels . If you are going to be printing out a lot of labels in bigger font , like say for wedding invitations , then I would choose a bigger label . I 'm not comfortable with inkjet generated labels since they are susceptible to water dissolving the ink ... for important letters , I like to stick with laser printed ones ( or use ballpoint pen ) .	1
I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years . I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels . I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two . I have gone back to the Avery labels . They are crisp , pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line . They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate .	1
The Avery 5160 labels have been around forever , but these have been improved . Easier to pull off the backing sheet - particularly the first label of the sheet .	1
Avery has always been good to work with , The background is always very bright white . If your printer is good , they never fail giving a clear great contrast . I have started to use P-Touch which is much faster . However if you do n't have a label maker such as P-Touch then this is the label paper for you . User friendly and most word processors have it built into there data base for your use .	1
I 've used Avery Labels for many years for my Christmas cards . They work good on either my inkjet when I want color , or my laser jet . There is a template on Microsoft Word ( Avery 5160 ) that makes creating the labels very easy . The size is just enough for name and address . There is no room to add Clip Art . You would have to use a larger label if you wanted to add let 's say a Christmas Tree or a Snowman picture . Now that I have these labels , I add a little sticker next to the name to make it look more festive and it looks like its part of the label so it 's fine . Also , there are so many labels ( 3000 ) in the box , that I usually give them away because after a few years they lose their sticking ability and become useless . Overall I like the Avery labels and feel confident they 're going to stick to the envelope .	1
Avery makes TrueBlock labels ( coated so that they block out anything underneath the label ) that I really love , so I decided to try these regular white labels too.The labels are perfectly fine . They print well with no smudges . `` Easy Peel '' is accurate - they are quite easy to remove from the sheet . Compared to the Trueblock labels I usually use though , they seem a little thinner and weaker . But they 're great for everyday use when you do n't need any coverage .	1
Like every Avery paper product I 've ever used in the last 25 years ( a whole lot ) , they are superior in terms of fit , function and finish . The thought of an Avery label jamming up my printer is non-existent . While it 's always possible to get cheaper labels , let 's just say you 'll get what you pay for with Avery . Not to mention you can really save a bundle by purchasing them on Amazon , as compared to any in-person stationary type store .	1
Side-by-side comparison:3M Address Labelsare just as good . Go for the best price.I 've used Avery and 3M labels for years.The 3M have the same easy-peel layout with different laughable slogans.The 3M package claims `` Permanent Adhesive '' and `` Strong Stick . '' The Avery stick just as well , or almost as well.I have not tried the less expensiveMaco Address Labels.I find the 1 '' x 2-5/8 '' size is big enough if you use size 9 font ( Arial ) . I get up to 38 characters per line x 5 lines .	1
I have used Avery labels for years and always find that they are exceptional . These labels glide through the printer , are easy to peel and use . The only issue I have is they sometimes smear if the weather is damp ( I use them to print labels for trips to Ecuador where the climate is very damp ) . Overall though , I have to give them 5-stars . Avery always works well and is of exceptional quality .	1
These are the standard size/weight address labels . There 's really not any way to make these exciting , but then again , do you really want excitement from an address label ? These are exactly what you expect , and I have to say I really do prefer the name brand labels to the office store brands . They just seem to feed & stick more reliably.These feed easily in both the drawer and tray of my laser printer , peel cleanly ( the non-label backing is already off the waxy paper , so removing them from the backing is super easy.I also really like that the label/template number is printed right on the label so you do n't have to hunt down the package to generate the appropriate template . Finally , I like the box . It 's sturdy corrugated with a flip-top lid so the lid wo n't go astray and the labels stay in the box , even if it 's sideways on as shelf.Mine came with a sample of note tabs , a nice extra bonus .	1
You just about ca n't beat Avery for quality labels . Templates for their labels easily available on their website , although I was a little annoyed that they required a name and e-mail address in order to download the template , even though they promised not to share the information . The acid test for any labels is whether or not they are going to peel off inside your printer , jamming and/or causing damage . Avery obviously knows adhesives well because these are firmly enough affixed to the backing sheet so that they do n't jam or peel off and yet are easy to peel off when you are ready to use them . These are a bit too large for return address labels , but would work for that . Best suited for the address of the person you are sending to . They are big enough for most addresses , although seem to be a little small for longer addresses . You can do 5 lines with a 10-point font and probably around 30 characters per line ( depending on whether you use all caps or lower case too ) . This would accommodate all but the longest addresses . It 's a little smaller than what I like , but still quite readable . I would n't want to go any smaller . If addresses are shorter , you can use a bigger font . I would have liked these a little wider than the 2 5/8 inches , but if they were any wider , a third less labels would be on each page . They really squeeze the maximum number ( 30 ) on an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet without any wasted space .	1
Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim . They 're high-quality and stick to what you put them on -- in this case , packages or envelopes . These have the added advantage of having what the company calls `` TrueBlock Technology '' -- which basically means that they block out the old address , allowing you to reuse the packaging materials . This is a great , eco-friendly solution . I 'm taking away one star because they 're harder to use in the printer than they should be . It 's always a trick figuring out which way to orient the sheet and get it set up to print properly . Granted , part of that is my own fault . But these should be easier to use . However , overall it 's a fine product .	1
These standard mailing labels ( 5160 ) come 30 labels to the page , and 100 sheets to the box . The easy peel feature makes for a really nice improvement over past generations of printable labels . Reusing a single sheet several times to print different labels did not cause any printer jams or smudges . These are premium labels at value prices .	1
I 've been using Avery 5160 return address labels for years , so I was interested in how the `` Easy Peel '' differed from the older ones I still had . When I took the first sheet out of the box , I was immediately concerned about the weight of the backing ; the sheets seemed much flimsier than those I had remaining in my old box , a choice obviously made in the interest of the pop-up edges . Once I printed a sheet of both and compared the labels themselves , they seemed comparable . However , a couple of issues emerged : it was slightly more difficult to manually insert a sheet of the Easy Peel so that the labels lined up correctly because the sheets were more likely to bow , and printed labels stored in a file folder were more likely to catch and come off when pulled in and out . Despite this , these labels maintain the Avery quality the company has been known for , and they stick well and completely to envelopes . Note : these labels are for laser printers , not for inkjets.The Easy Peel feature is only marginally better than the old style , which I never found difficult to remove . Here , you fold the sheet along each row , and a small portion of the labels ' ends pop up . It definitely can save time if you 're doing a lot of mailing/labeling ; however , most people wo n't care . I appreciated the feed arrows since I always forget which end should be up when feeding manually . I printed ten sheets out of the box , in rapid succession , and other than the lining up issue noted above , every sheet came out smoothly and perfectly printed.Although Microsoft Word has the necessary template for these labels in its project gallery , buyers can also get the correct template at the Avery website ( address supplied on the box ) .I 've used several different brands of mailing labels , and I always come back to Avery . Despite the lighter backing of these labels to enable the `` Easy Peel , '' the labels themselves maintain the same high quality . I just wish the ease of removal could be combined with a slightly heavier/stiffer backing . Five stars for the label quality , three stars for the Easy Peel design. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
I 'm notorious for using things for purposes they were not intended for , and these labels are no exception . I do n't use them as mailing labels.When this big box of 3,000 labels arrived , I immediately pulled off a few of the labels and stuck them to the top and smooth side ( vertically ) of a half-pint canning jar and onto a ziplock bag and put them in the freezer . A day later , the labels were still adhering well , and yet they were not a complete pain to get off . ( Try pulling the label off dry , and if it does n't come right off , it will come off after a soak in dishwater . ) So now I can print out sheets of labels like `` 08/2010 Tomato Sauce '' or `` 2010 Okra Seeds '' and have them handy for when I 'm canning , freezing , and dehydrating all my garden produce and saving seeds for next season . I put up a LOT of food . Also , I can quickly write and stick eat-by dates on anything in the fridge.Labels for canning jars cost a lot of money . These are just the ticket , and I can print whatever info onto them that I need . They will work at room temperature , in the fridge , or in the freezer , and there are lots and lots of them . Just what I needed !	1
Like all Avery labels I have tried , these work great . Print smoothly through the printer without jamming or sticking . I print individual labels and reuse the sheet again and they still work great . Highly recommended .	1
These are great labels which work as expected.Pros : -No jams in my inkjet or laser-Easy to peel and stick on envelopes-Nice white colorCons : -None that I can see.There 's not a whole lot to say here , these are labels that print well and do n't jam . Peel and stick is great . Buy one , buy ten !	1
These labels work great for labeling reloaded ammo boxes . I basically run them through my laser printer to print a basic template that includes : date , bullet , bullet weight , over-all length , powder , and powder charge . Then , after I finish with a reloading session , I just use a pen to fill in the blanks and then stick a label onto each box.These labels have just the right amount of 'stickiness ' to hold tightly to a plastic ammo box - while still being removable without leaving any residue or sticky mess behind . After I empty each box , I just peel the sticker off and the box is ready to go again.I realize that this specific use probably is n't interesting to everyone , but it seems like these labels could be applied in a similar way to lots of different organizing tasks.Since a single sheet of labels can last me several weeks , I like that these labels stay stuck to the printer backing and do n't come off before I 'm ready to use them . Fortunately , the labels are still easy to peel off the backing sheet because of an exposed pop-up edge for each label - it 's a pretty ingenious setup.Finally , for those of you who are using these as mailing labels , I 've found that the glue is nearly permanent when applied to paper envelopes - so no worries there.Overall , I 'm completely satisfied with this product and I highly recommend them .	1
I use a lot of labels to print scannable barcodes , I have tried some other brands with 1/3 of the price I pay for the Avery brand , but the quality was not good , plus the paper was too glossy , I had a lot of complaints about the labels that can not be read by the scanner , had to switch back to Avery labels and all the complaints disappeared .	1
This was received via the Vine Program . These classic white labels are the perfect size for addressing standard sized business envelopes ( # 10 size ) . Great for return address too . They 're big enough for about 4 lines of text at 12 pt type . Plus these labels integrate automatically with the labels tool that comes with Microsoft Word ( Tools > Letters and Mailings > Envelopes and Labels ) . You even can print one label at a time , instead of a whole sheet . Just choose the row and position of the desired single label when using the tool.Avery has added some perforation to the backside of the sheet ( not through the label , but the paper sheet that the label is on ) . It makes it easier to peel a single label off , although I never have had a problem with this before ) .Frankly , it 's so much easier to print to labels than to run a thick envelope through my printer , I seldom print directly to an envelope anymore.The only issue I could see is if you want your labels to be the same color as your envelope , then you may want Avery clear labels.3,000 Compulabel 370056 Clear Matte Address Labels ( Use Avery 5660 Template ) The labels in this product listing are white .	1
Excellent labels . Expecially like the Easy-Peel feature . These labels say `` Laser '' but will also work in an inkject printer . Only problem I had was in aligning them using OpenOffice.org 's label-making software . Took a little bit of time to get it right . But , that is my own fault . The labels are designed with Microsoft Word/Works Avery templates in mind and worked great under borth .	1
This product the standard for the typical address label 30 per page . It is both jam and smudge free so the labels are ready to use the minute they come out of the printer . They are easy to peel of the sheet and will get your mailings done quickly . Make a sheet for each company you have frequent dealing with to make correspondence chores easier.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers , 1 x 2-5/8 Inches , Box of 3000 Labels ( 5160 )	1
Well , its a label . Its white and it goes on an envelope . Not much you can say about these other than its a huge amount of labels . Most if not all printing software recognizes Avery in its page setup . Because of this you should not have a problem getting your software to format the page so they print out on these . The easy peel is nice when you are doing a massive mailing.Thank you for reading my review .	1
They do n't get jammed in the printer , the labels do n't peel off unexpectedly , the sheets do not stick together , so that is all that I ask from labels . One thing that you should consider is the price and how many you 'll need.The price for the labels is competitive versus others in the market . While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user , the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings . I am somewhere in between and have found these to be perfectly acceptable .	1
These `` White Easy Peel Address Labels '' from Avery really speed up addressing envelopes or packages . The new `` Pop-up Edge '' design is a time saver . A simple bend of the sheet back at a column , and you 're ready to place the label . They seem to stick well , even through the postal service . I never had one fall off of an envelope yet . When sticking a lot of envelopes they make the job easy . Try them !	1
These labels are very easy to use . The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page . We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems ( Using MS Word label template . This is a standard size that was listed in the software ) . In fact , I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly . They peel easily off the page so you do n't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off . Highly recommended .	1
These are great printer labels from the folks at Avery , it comes 3000 labels to box so you 're set for very long time ( unless yo have business or something like that ) Heck , I use them in BOTH my printer and and even pen write the address on them on occasion . Great mailing labels IMO and very recommended !	1
If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you 'll want reliable label sheets . That 's what Avery offers with this item . Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes . This item contains enough labels to last awhile . These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects , not just for mailing addresses . Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you 'll find useful .	1
This is a great product . Works well , perfect for mailing addresses . Highly recommend .	1
These labels work well for many uses . They stick well and are easy to print on using my computer . Great product !	1
I have two different laser printers , each with a special envelope slot that is meant to feed envelopes so that you can print an address directly on each envelope . There are two problems with both . First , you can feed only one envelope at a time ( they wo n't accomodate a stack of envelopes ) . Secondly , half of the time the envelope jams and you must pull the printer apart to fix the problem . So , I have given up on running envelopes through my laser printers.The Avery Easy Peal mailing label sheets fit into the standard 8.5 '' by 11 '' tray and feed flawlessly through the print track . I can print 300 labels in less than a minute and each label peels off the backing easily and can be stuck to an envelope or package quickly.The drawback is , you must run a sheet of 30 labels through the printer even if you need only one label . But if you have a lot of mailing to do , this generous quantity of labels helps get the job done quickly and inexpensively .	1
Avery 5160 labels have been a workhorse for me for years . This new variation does make it a little easier to remove the labels , which is a good thing . Ranking wise , I like these better than Staples ' house brand version , but not quite as good as the 3M version .	1
I 'll go into more detail about what 's superior about Avery below , but first , regarding this size -- These will fit a four-line address in 10 or 11 point type , and are good for : -Return address labels on # 10 envelopes-Address labels for 4x6 postcardsFor address labels on # 10 envelopes , I prefer Avery 5162 , as they 'll fit or a four or five-line address in 12 point type . `` Easy Peel '' basically means that the `` extra '' adhesive paper around the edges of the labels is absent . This does make them easier to peel , but I do n't think Avery is even selling non-Easy Peel 5160s anymore , so it does n't really matter.Especially because you must . buy . Avery . if you want a professional result . Avery and name brand printer toner.I 've tried several different generic brands -- from all three big office retailers -- and the letters get smeared or flake off when applying the labels . Add generic toner , and the problem gets so bad that the printing becomes almost illegible . With generic toner these smear a little bit , but with the name brand toner ( I 've used these in both HPs and Canons ) , I do n't start noticing toner on my fingers until I 'm 500+ pieces into a mailing.For mailings to prospective clients/customers , smudging is totally unacceptable . The generic labels might seem a lot cheaper , but these are well worth the extra dough .	1
I use these to label products , as well as envelopes.The price and convenience is great when purchasing in bulk . Note that these stickers adhere well to paper , however plastic takes a little bit more patience . They do not smear when allowed to dry properly ( maybe 10-15 seconds once fully out of the printer ) and the paper does not fold in on itself like generic labels .	1
Perfect . I also use uline compatibles.Both great . Avery is a little better when the Avery template is used . They are perfect matched in terms of printable positions .	1
Avery 's Easy Peel 5160 address labels are much easier to remove from the printed sheet than the standard Avery 5160 labels . But , that ease comes with a few limitations illustrated the images that I 've uploaded . These may or may not affect you.For this review , I printed an entire sheet of return address labels on each product . The Easy Peel labels are unquestionably easier to remove than the standard labels , as you simply flex the sheet and the edges of the labels in one column detach from the backing sheet as shown in the photos I 've posted.If you typically print full sheets of labels , you 'll be pleased with the ease of removing the labels . While the standard labels can sometimes curl , or get a damaged corner as you peel , these labels come off cleanly.But , there are two situations where the standard Avery product is still better : printing single labels and re-using the sheet , and tearing the sheet into thirds for storage or distribution of labels.Microsoft Word ( and other software ) has the ability to print a single label on a sheet in the row and column specified in the label dialog . This works well with the standard Avery product . With the Easy Peel product , if you 've accidentally bumped adjacent labels while peeling off printed ones , the labels may jam your printer . ( The jam-free guarantee refers to fresh sheets of labels . ) If you typically tear your 5160 sheet at the perforations to get three columns of labels , you will not want to do that with the Easy Peel product . As shown in the photos , unlike the clean edge of the older product , the Easy Peel coumn has about 1/8 '' of the sticky label extending beyond the backing after tearing .	1
Granted , nobody goes orgasmic over labels . Labels are labels , right ? They are until they jam up , or smear when you take them out of your printer . Nothing more aggravating that having labels that accordion up in your printer , and the labels curdle and get stuck in the mechanism.It does n't happen with Avery labels . They simply work . Print a list , and it 's sitting in the printer tray , perfect and ready to use , every time.You might not spend a lot of time , thinking about labels , until you ca n't get them to print right . If you use Avery , you 'll never have to think about labels ever again , cause they just do what they 're supposed to do : print perfectly , every time .	1
For years I used to send away for return labels and then I found out how easy it is to make my own and I 'll never send away again.You go to the website listed on the box and get the free templates there and make perfect labels . There are several new designs available for both PC & Mac and they 're a breeze to make.There are 3000 labels in the box and the price is incredible . I 'll be set with labels for decades.These new ones now Pop-Up when you bend the sheet making them the easiest to peel off for use , THEY '' RE GREAT !	1
There 's not a whole lot to say about these labels . The do come off the backing easily and stick where they 're supposed to . I used them in both an ink jet and a laser jet printer and both worked just fine .	1
Got ta hand it to Avery , they 've locked the sticky label market up . These are fairly priced , sticky , and there 's nothing to not like about them.Paired with a quick printer , these can save you a whole lot of time , and they will stay stuck .	1
We use these at work and they work great in both of our printers . We have an inkjet and a laser printer and they feed perfectly in both . They peel off easily , too .	1
It is one of the most-friendly office supplies . It is easy-to-print labels with formatting provided free-of-charge from Avery . It 's definitely a good buy if you need to mail a lot .	1
The Avery 5160s are the workhorse labels of our office . Do n't be fooled by cheaper imitations , they do not stick reliably , yellow , or jam in the printers . Avery is , as always , a great dependable product .	1
Super easy to use tabs . I use them to label items in my house . Super easy peel , clear instructions , easy to load , template available from a word processing program . They work with inkjets but you can definitely tell they are better when used with laser printers . They are worth it !	1
i use these on a daily basis ... easy to use ... no smudges ... never had a problem . would purchase again . never used before but will def . use again	1
These Avery labels do exactly what they 're supposed to.They feed perfectly , are perfectly spaced on the label sheet , are easy to peel and position.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work : You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Tools ; then Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5160Type in what you want on the labeland print.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking labels . I use them as return address labels , because this size is `` taller '' than many and allows an extra line or two on the label.Really ! -- you wo n't be diaappointed -- these labels live up to the Avery reputation .	1
A label should n't leave you disappointed , since it 's really about as basic a product a you can get . I guess you want them to 1 ) not jam , 2 ) hold ink , 3 ) peel easily , 4 ) stick . These labels do all 4 as they should .	1
My wife is a teacher and classes are starting . She has lockers assigned to her homeroom . She gets a box of locks , and a form which has her assigned lockers printed on it . She puts a lock on the locker , and then copies the combination from the tag to the form.If she reads the combination out loud , or hands the sheet to a student to copy their combination off of it , the student can overhear someone else 's combination or copy it off of the sheet while copying their own . She said , `` I could use labels for this . `` So I said , `` Anything to help the educational system . I have these labels I have to test for Vines ! `` So I selected the laser labels because they have a laser printer at school . Unfortunately , they had turned off the air conditioner , despite a promise to leave it on for the entire weekend before school . It was unbearably hot ( the classrooms have no ventilation at all if the A/C is off - they just bake in the sun . So we came home.First we put the lockers and their combinations into a spreadsheet . Then I told Microsoft word to fill in a sheet of labels with the information from the spreadsheet . I selected Avery , then I selected 8 1/2 '' x11 '' products and then 5160 and the first sheet I printed had a problem . I had put the info on the labels on the left edge of the printed area , and a full character printed in the gutter between labels . The result was completely unusable . The locker combinations had the first character cut off , and that could be a 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3 . I printed a plain sheet of paper first and laid it over the labels , but the `` one character off '' was too close to tell.I printed them again , and this time I centered the labels . They came out perfectly . The ink does not smudge.The point is that she can peel a label off , and hand it to the student . Then she writes the locker number down on her form . The student gets their locker number and combination in one action , without being allowed to either look at the form that has everyone 's combination on it , or hear combinations be read aloud . I offered her a second set of labels with just locker numbers on it , for her form . She said it would be easier to just write it , given the area that had to be fit and the size of the label.I was pleased that the laser labels worked in my inkjet printer - even though the paper path is tight . I was disappointed in the fact that the labels were about a character off from the template - and in the wrong direction , resulting in characters missing the label to the left , and resulting in my wasting a sheet of labels . I tried navigating the Avery site for label templates and gave up after a couple of minutes when I realized that they were built into Microsoft Word.I was pleased in the way the ink does not smudge , despite the fact that this is not labeled for use in ink jet printers.And when she went to use the labels , my wife said that the labels were `` Wonderfully easy to remove , the process was fast , you never thought about the labels , they just worked . `` So the only star off was for the templates . Avery should check their templates if they are going to allow Microsoft to use their name .	1
I got these labels thinking that the `` Easy Peel '' seemed kind of gimmicky ... how could it really make a difference ? But I have to say that it works well . The sheet of labels has three pre-scored `` lines '' where it folds . Print your labels , fold along one of the lines , and the edges of ten of the labels are quickly exposed to make peeling super easy . This might not make a difference if you are only printing a few labels , but it could be a nice time saver if you are doing a mass mailing.One other side note ... These labels are for laser printers . Be sure to get the type of labels that are designed for your printer ( inkjet labels for inkjet printers , laser labels for laser printers ) . In the past , I have made the mistake of trying to use sheets of labels in my laser printer even though they were not designed for a laser printer . Do n't make that mistake . My Brother HL-2070N smelled like something was burning after just one sheet . But with these Avery LASER labels , my laser printer handled them perfectly .	1
If you search Amazon or the web , you will know this is the best deal around . I run these labels through laser printer . It has no problems with the heat . Some other brands I tried have the glues tuned to different colors . But this one is O.K . With the quality and price , I can not recommend it more	1
Works well first time every time . Free downloadable templates work with open office/ word etc ... very good product . I use with inkjet fine .	1
This set of mailing labels from Avery is a nice set where you get 100 sheets with 30 labels on each sheet . While they are good for envelopes , they are the suggested size for current Fulfillment by Amazon ( FBA ) sellers , which is what I find value in . I dont send many letters or cards out , so using it for FBA.As said , Avery is the standard in the label making department . They are not the only ones , but outside of Amazon , they are at Target , Staples , and Office Depot among others . But honestly - the price that Amazon is currently offering , at 71 % off at the time of this writing , you can get 100 sheets for $ [ ... ] bucks , which is what you would pay for 25 sheets at any other place . So its the best deal you are going to get ! ! There are tons of different sizes for all different reasons . This set advertises that they are the `` send to '' address type label which is a perfect size . As usual , you might meet up with the issue of only needing a few labels for addresses or whatever project you are doing and you have the rest of the sheet to deal with . Its not always easy to feed printers and set it up to utilize the rest of the sheet.I like Avery and tend to get their stuff as they print best on the sheet and they are most accessible in a pinch .	1
Unlike a couple of other reviews , they do not jam in my printer and they do not smear . So they work just fine for me . The `` Easy Peel '' part of it is n't particularly relevant for me since I do n't have any trouble peeling the regular Avery labels . So to me they are just labels that work fine - no problems but not special either .	1
Very good price and works well . Much cheaper than office depot . Can not find a cheaper deal any where else . Good buy	1
This generous box comes with 3000 labels , each sheet containing 30 white labels . My software did n't have the recommended Avery 5160 template when designing my mailing labels , but it was an universal fit and worked with all of the 1 '' X 2 5/8 '' templates ( I tried and used all 6 of my templates successfully , even if they were n't from the specific avery company . Since I have had problems in the past with a competing company , I was pleased with the fact that these labels were instantly dried and therefore there was no smearing that occured with the drying process . Overall , these are extreamely useful for address labels and come highly recommended .	1
When it comes down to it , labels are just labels . You print on them , you peel and you stick ... done.What makes these great , other than the fact that they are quality labels that are easy to peel , are the templates . Templates for almost anything [ ... ] that help make projects easier.While these are generally intended for address labels , they can be used for much more . As one example , recently I needed to run a correction for a yearbook that I helped put together . I was afraid that it would be hard to do ; I was wrong . The 5160 happened to be the correct size -- it would cover the incorrect entry fully with enough room for the correction . I used one of the templates for Word and quickly typed out a correction on the template . I was afraid it would be hard to line up in the printer ; I was wrong again . The first test print was perfect , so I ran the rest . Within a total of five minutes I had an exact match for the original project -- a printed label that can be placed over the original information in the book ... 60 copies . It matches great and it looks great.For simple addressing , these are also supported by the Apple Macintosh Address Book program , so printing labels for your Christmas cards or other needs are a breeze.The quality of the labels is superb as are all Avery product . They correctly run through my printers with no jamming problems at all.I highly recommend these labels .	1
These are great little labels . I 've had no issues with peeling or smudging , and the templates were super-easy to use withMicrosoft Word .	1
Prints very well without jamming up my printer . Easy to peel & they stay on the envelope without falling off . Enough labels in the box to last me quite awhile ... .	1
These Avery labels are excellent quality , I 've never had a problem with these ripping , yet I can peel them with ease . They fit in the paper trays and they are pulled into printers , line up with the software that i 've used , printed , and expelled onto the output tray . I 've NEVER had a problem using them . I also use them for things like labeling wires and pipes in my house . I 've even used a couple of them as Christmas gift labels after I ran out of regular labels . They are easily stored . Purchased from Amazon , it arrived quickly and in excellent condition . I give everything that I review a grade , and I believe that this merits a solid `` A '' . I highly recommend it for anyone who uses labels for mass mailings , printed labels on files , etc .	1
I am cheap and prefer to buy `` no-name '' products whenever possible . My luck with laser print labels has been hit and miss . The Avery mailing labels work like a charm . They are easy to peel and work great .	1
These labels work as advertised . Can fit four lines addresses , they go through the laser printer with no jams , no smudges , easy to peal , and they stick to the envelope . I use them for return address too . They work as expected.Avery Also offers a variety of free software to design and print labels : [ ... ] .	1
I 've used Avery labels since my days as a mail clerk , way back in the Carter administration . They have always offered a top-quality product , and the Easy Peel line for laser printers are no exception.These labels are just so wonderful ; by using word processing software such as Microsoft Word , one can easily select the 'labels and envelops ' option under 'Tools ' and up pops the correct format for the labels . Just start typing or import addresses and you are ready to go . I 'll admit that the most use I 've had on these labels are for Christmas cards and hand writing labels , but these would be great for a small business.Recommended product ; another winner from Avery . They work well , perform well , and do n't screw up the laser printer . As good as it gets .	1
I use these labels all the time . The only thing I have found *wrong* with them is that they do n't stick to every surface as well as I would like ( but that 's to be said of most stickers ) . They are easy to peel but that also means that when you stick them on certain surfaces ( ie : shiny boxes ) , the can have their edges `` roll '' in a bit after time .	1
I usually use generic mailing labels however with the smaller labels I find it so much easier to use the Avery labels due to their ease of removal from the sheet . Good labels at a much better price than you 'd ever find locally .	1
I compared these Avery 5160 white labels with some off-brand labels I 've used in the past . They are very similar in print quality and ease of use . The Avery labels use their 5160 template , which is available in Microsoft Word or from the free software available for download from [ ... ] . Either way , the labels are easy to format and print . The easy peel feature makes it easier to remove the labels compared with my off-brand labels.I also compared these with Avery 's 5260 labels , which are almost identical in size , use the same 5160 template , and have the same easy peel feature but cost quite a bit more . If you do a lot of label printing the 5160 package with 3000 labels is a much better value for the money spent . Keep in mind these labels are only for use with a laser printer .	1
I have a set of the same size 1 x 2.62 inch Avery labels for addresses for my Ink Jet printer which always have worked very well but I was happy to get labels to use with my laser printer since the printing does n't run if subjected to moisture.I printed up three sheets on my 3 year old Canon imageCLASS MF3240 Monochrome Laser All-in-One Printer and they were clear , perfectly aligned ( Avery makes good , free , downloadable software ) , that peeled off easily to apply to my Christmas card envelopes . This is the perfect size for address labels.I did n't have a chance to bring up my print list for over a year after I ordered these labels but time does n't seem to affect Avery labels in the least . I recommend Avery labels for any purpose , actually .	1
What else can I say ? Easy peel , as described , go thru printer without jamming , templates available for setting up mailing lists . Avery products are usually great and this is no exception ! ! These do a fine job ! ! !	1
Avery labels are always great and these are no exception to that rule . They are bright white , feed smoothly through our laser printers and perform just as you would want on paper . When using such labels on cardboard , I recommend another brand . Other brands actually work better on tough surfaces due to stronger adhesive but for envelopes and simple task Avery labels ca n't be beat . One Avery advantage is how easy they are to peal off the sheet before they are applied which comes from their unique adhesive.MAKE SURE you are buying the correct type of label for your printer . Most households use INK JET printers not a LASER PRINTER which is what these are designed for . That makes a big difference as the wrong type for your printer will make a mess and just plain not work .	1
As a boutique consulting and travel firm , image is important to us , as well as cost control . We use labels of various sizes constantly rather than getting envelopes and folders pre-printed as a cost saving measure and a way to offer easy customization of our brand to our clients.As others have stated here , a label is a label is a label ... right ? Not always . There are many factors that I look at when buying labels , especially in quantity:1 . Price . Big variances between 'generic ' and 3M , Avery , etc.2 . Glue . Good glue wo n't come through the label.3 . Adhesive Quality . Labels should n't come off an envelope ( which could result in a dead letter ) , and they should n't come off in the printer ( which could result in the need for a new printer ) .4 . Ease of removing from sheet . If they are not easy to remove , the label can be easily torn . Sometimes I 've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value , and have the other characteristics of good labels . Whenever I have a choice between an Avery label and another product ( even at a much lower price ) I buy the Avery .	1
These stickers are wonderful ! They not only hold printer ink without smearing , but when the sticker is stuck onto the package it stays put without the corners peeling up !	1
These shipping labels work great for recycling mailers . I 've used them to mail several packages & it 's a great convenience to no longer have to spend five minutes or more trying to peel off old labels before re-using padded mailers.With Avery 's TrueBlock technology , it 's a snap to quickly print a label that completely covers the old label . These labels work just like conventional laser labels -- just use Avery 's template to print the labels you need . The `` magic '' is in the dark , vinyl-like coating on the `` sticky side '' of the label . This dark screening coat completely blocks out the label underneath , so nothing shows through . Just a clean , neatly printed new , bright white label.Elegantly engineered recycling solution ; Highly recommended !	1
It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use . They 're an Avery product , so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you 're likely to use with them , so formatting the print data is a snap . What makes these labels different is their construction . They 're thicker than the typical mailing label , with a white front and a dark gray sticky side . This makes the labels truly opaque , so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over . I 've tried to see through them , and I have n't been able to . This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees .	1
These are great , functional labels at a very reasonable price . The 2x4-inch size is big enough for hand-written addresses and still fits 10 to a sheet for economy 's sake , many more labels per sheet than the slightly larger sizes without much loss of usability . The `` TrueBlock '' ability to hide what 's behind them -- seemingly due to a gray layer behind the labels ' white surface , like primer under a coat of paint -- is nice , though this was never a real problem for other labels to begin with . Simply put , these work great for their purpose .	1
It 's a label . I 'm not going to try to wax poetic about it . But it 's a very good label . The basics : *The labels feed smoothly into my laser printer and emerge the same way . No jamming , no smearing . *The TrueBlock ( TM ) Technology works well . This allows you to reuse manila envelopes and boxes without looking so much like you 're recycling them ... as long as the original label is n't larger than 2 inches by four inches . ( A fairly generous size for a single address ; small to include address of origin alongside the address of destination . ) They retain a professional , clean appearance . *The bright white of the templates contrasts beautifully with dark print , keeping visibility clear . Again , professional and clean . *In addition , Avery will give you support as you use them . On the back of each sheet they 've printed ( in two languages ) tips for use and directions for where to go on the web to get templates for Microsoft Word on the web or through e-mail . ( Not sure why they need my name and e-mail address for me to download these templates , but they promise not to Spam me . I 'm trusting that it 's because it gives them the opportunity to ask me to opt-in to e-mails ... the default . I opted out . ) In addition to the blank template for mailing labels ( be sure you enter the product number , 5263 , to easily access the right ones ! ) , there are `` specialized '' templates for use particularly with color printers . Current themes include holidays , seasons , special events ( birth , wedding , graduation ) , patriotic and a host of various business ideas ( dental , salon , etc . ) They currently have 57 downloads available in support of this one product.All in all , a good solid product with really exceptional support from an industry leader . I 'll feel confident in ordering this product again .	1
These labels are exactly what they say they are- truly blocking . We use them within our elementary school reading program . Finally , we have labels that allow for reuse of pocket portfolios without compromising the identity of its previous owner . Besides , no one wants to use a folder that has the shadow of a name behind your own ! These labels look good , save us money and time . At home , we use them when reusing shipping envelopes and boxes . My co-workers , husband , and students love them and you will too !	1
Avery labels have been considered the best when you need or want labels that you can print from your computer . These are no different . Whenever mailing anything , from letters to packages through the US Postal Service , using a pre-printed label allows your item to travel faster without having to be handled by human hands . This prevents loss , mis-sent , delayed or damaged letters and packages . Avery brand labels are the most trouble free labels available .	1
How many times have I used a magic marker to cover an old package label ... lots ! I was surprised and very pleased to see these labels with TrueBlock Technology ! It works ! A real time saver and no more ink on my fingers from the marker . Add a package of these labels to your shipping arsenal . And , if your word processing software does n't have a template for them , you can download it from Avery 's website.Once you use them , I bet you 'll be sure to keep a supply on hand . Highly recommended .	1
A long time user of Avery labels , I was especially drawn to these because of the promise of smudge-free labels with sheets that pass easily . I have a finicky , but expensive , printer that on occasion wrinkles sheets that pass through the manual , non-drawer feeder . This happens most frequently with labels . So I was happy to see that after using more than 2 dozen of these sheets that they do indeed pass smoothly as described , furthermore no smudging ! ! ! This is vitally important as with these big labels pressing them onto envelopes sometimes requires quite a bit of handling . I 'm very happy with these labels and will definitely be switching from the regular 2X4 labels to these with TrueBlock that work seamlessly and smudge-free.Highly recommended !	1
These labels are so nice . The template they come with ( if you read the included piece of paper ) , is easy to fill out and make shipping stuff so quick and painless . It is nice to have a large enough label to put both the address and return address . Worth the money !	1
These are great labels . The TrueBlock works very well ( the sticky side is coated and blocks out anything underneath the label ) .Laser printer prints clear and nice on the labels , and the labels are easy to remove from the sheet.I use them for labeling mail , paper , folders , even used them for nametags in a pinch.You can also cut them to desired shape and use them to make corrections on papers/flyers/postcards.Really really good .	1
I ca n't say that I 've ever been blown away by printer labels , these do deliver on their marketing promises . I found that they did in fact do a a great job of covering up and blocking out any printing underneath the label . That makes them incredibly helpful when you want to reuse boxes . I also found I had very few problems with the labels jamming in the printer or getting smudged . Admittedly , I 've often blamed the former on my printer in the past but who knew it might actually have been the design of the labels to blame.I also like that they now have an online interface for designing labels that requires no downloads . For me this has made making great labels more user friendly because I always found the templates in word to be a bit clunky and limiting . The only thing I dislike is that many of the designs available look a bit dated and heavy on clip art . It 's a shame because elsewhere on the web I 've found great printables from bloggers or designers , they just do n't always offer the ability to edit the text or are n't sized to fit the label sizes I have.Overall though a solid product made easier with the online label design capabilities .	1
I have used Avery labels for years for my small buisness . No complaints . They work well , are easy to format , and print smoothly . Also love that Avery has box tops on the envelope that the labels come in . So I got two box tops and great labels . Avery also has some great templates to use for these labels . I have used the labels for shipping and for labeling books or other items .	1
These labels are nice , thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them . They 're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels , which allow the previous printing to show through . They 're completely effective at blocking what they cover , and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input . They peel easily from the backing , and very easy to handle because they 're thick and do n't roll when you remove them . They are not quite as bright white as the typical label , due to the gray layer on the adhesive side , which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels . They 're crisp looking labels , and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something .	1
I use labels a lot ... for postage and for labeling items around the house and in the garage . These are really easy to use ( ALL the avery labels are ! ) , but what I really love about these is that I do n't have to peel off the old shipping label if I 'm re-using a box or envelope . These will cover the old label so all that shows is the new information . BIG time-saver , not to mention the savings that come from re-using boxes and envelopes !	1
Not much to say here , the product works as advertised . The labels are easy to use , old text covered up is as advertised , and there are plenty of templates to print these out.Easy to use , nice price , great product . What 's not to love ? ? ? ***** RECOMMENDED	1
What can you say these are mailing labels for large envelopes or packages . They are plain white , come in sheets of ten with the usual supporting formats in office suites and online at the Avery website . The one key aspect of these labels that makes them different from the standard labels is the TrueBlock that masks any text that they are laid over , no more seeing through the label to the prior addressee.As far as I am concerned these labels fulfill all of the claims made by Avery and work splendidly . P- )	1
These labels are easy to print on and block out any information underneath them so you can ship without worrying . There are 250 in the package so you can ship a lot of packages with just this one package of labels . I highly recommend this for businesses .	1
I have found that the TrueBlock line of products comes in handy when re-using boxes . Labels from this product line are thick enough to completely cover old labels . They also tend to peel very easily from the sheet , but to stick very securely to packages . I have not had a single label jam in the printer . Finally , they seem to resist wrinkling while being applied to boxes better that any other label i have used .	1
I 've been using labels of this size under the brand of a national office box store , and in one notable way , the Avery product is superior . These labels have a dark underside ( `` TrueBlock '' ) which successfully masks what 's underneath , making them perfect for covering a previous label on a box . My box store brand labels are more translucent , something I accepted without thought until I tried these labels . Since I reuse a lot of boxes , I wo n't be going back to the more generic kind , even though they , too , may be manufactured by Avery . Both print on my laser printer without smearing . Both look crisp . But only these Avery labels are completely opaque.For users of Microsoft Word , you can use the Label Wizard to set up printing , or you can go to the company 's web site to download the label templates.The only thing that I did n't like about these labels is their flimsy backing sheet , which does n't affect the labels themselves but which makes it more difficult to line up the sheets in my printer . Every so often , I 'll print one that is slightly crooked because the sheet did n't get held properly in place by the manual feed slots . This issue is not enough to make me return to the box store brand , but I wish Avery still used its heavier backing stock. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
I really like these labels . They are just thick enough to cover up writing or old labels when recycling envelopes . Nothing shows through from the old stuff underneath - these labels are just large enough to cover the edges on an older label as well . The slightly larger size makes them nice for printing a photo logo on the corner while leaving room for the address information in a font size that can still be seen with the naked eye . Nice product that I will buy again in the future .	1
As I writer , I am often sending out short story manuscripts to potential markets . I 'm a great recycler of envelopes , but I spend far too much time trying to peel and/or scrape off the old labels while trying not to tear into the envelopes . These thick labels ( they call it `` TrueBlock Technology '' ) will go right on top of the old labels and cover them up completely . Works like a charm ! They 're big enough for long addresses or large fonts , and you can even create logo shipping labels with them .	1
I am now hooked on the Avery line of labels . These work just as well as the other ones I 've tried - go through my inkjet printer w/ no smears , cover up well , stick well , etc . I will definitely purchase in the future .	1
Avery White Shipping Labels make mass mailings easy and trouble-free . Each sheet of ten labels feeds smoothly into your printer and the addresses come out smudge-free . The labels are easy to peel and attach snugly to your envelope or package . You can place these labels over old labels and the new ones will cover the old printing completely . This is a useful and reliable product .	1
I received these via the Vine Program , so what could be better than getting something that you use every day ? Getting it for free to test and review.These are perfect for addressing and printing return labels on envelopes or printing labels for just about anything . Plus , they integrate automatically with the labels tool that comes with Microsoft Word ( Tools > Letters and Mailings > Envelopes and Labels ) . You even can print one label at a time , instead of a whole sheet . Just choose the row and position of the desired single label when using the tool.I only wish they were a little less pricey ( I mean , when I have to pay for them myself ) . Still , I give kudos to Avery for really knowing their stuff and delivering what people want . And yes , I would have written the same review , even if I had to buy these myself . . . except maybe I would have used an adjective in front of price , such as ridiculously high . . . or is that an adverb ?	1
In this yet another superior product from Avery , these laser shipping labels can be accommodated to any size envelope as they are not too big and not too small , so as to seem not aesthetically fitting.Their actual size is 2 '' x 4 '' , guaranteed to be jam free and smudge free ( have n't tested this claim extensively yet as I have just begun to use them . So far they work out fine and my printer likes them ) .I 've often bought small labels for small envelopes , and larger for bigger ones . Now I do n't have to do that anymore , slightly uncomplicating my life . And that 's welcome ! These labels also cover any printing underneath should one want to send something out in a used enveloped . That 's a pennysaver ! Thanks , Avery , for another fine product .	1
The free template works well in creating printable labels . This size also allows me to have the return address on the left hand corner so only 1 label is needed for mailing rather than 2 . Love it !	1
I use labels on reused glass tincture bottles for my clients , and since not all of the originals have easily removed labels , it has been frustrating trying to use labels that show through or do n't sufficiently cover the original . I am therefore very happy to find a label with TrueBlock technology , but also one that works with laser printers which are less likely to bleed if the label gets wet . This also works well on recycled envelopes . Thumbs up to Avery .	1
These Avery labels are specially designed to coverup anything underneath them . They call this TrueBlock , and if you want to be extra sure that nothing can be seen through the label you put on something then this is valuable . If you do n't need this then these labels would be an unnecessary expense in comparison to ordinary mailing labels.These labels are designed for laser printers , though you could also use them in an inkjet . Just make sure you set the proper template in your word processor before printing . These labels are something that I 'll have available whenever I need to re-use a package/shipping envelope that has dark writing on it .	1
I am married to a woman who sells lots of things on Ebay . She is also very conscious of recycling everything she can . I work for a company that visual appeal when shipping something is almost everything , so when I reuse something , it better look new . Sometimes , my wife asks me to package something up for her using an old packing envelope , that 's fine but I either have to remove the old label or place the new one over the old one allowing you to see the old info . To compromise , we decided to try these labels and much to my surprise , I ca n't see the old label under this one . Yes they are a little more expensive , but it does make our marriage a little better .	1
Most labels these days are just good labels . However , if you are looking for labels that will be printed in a laser printer , I 'll recommend Avery 's products , as I 've had great results with them . No paper jams in my HP color laser printer , and no paper jams in my HP black and white laser printer . The labels separate nicely from their backing , and they stick nicely.These labels are designed by Avery with what they call , `` TrueBlock ( TM ) Technology '' - and I have to agree , if you stick these over the top of an existing label , these will cover them well , and you wo n't see the label underneath it showing through . If the box has some writing on it , and you stick this label over the writing , you will not see the writing through this label . Nice !	1
These are nice shipping labels if you do a bunch of shipping from your computer . Each sheet has 10 stickers on it , generally one for `` From '' , and one from `` To '' , although you can configure however you want.Avery 's `` True Block '' tech is basically a sticker with a solid background , so you could put it on top of an old shipping label on a box you might be re-using , and you ca n't see the old label . Generally , I do n't ship re-used boxes , so that part is n't so much a big deal , but it 's nice that it 's there . It also gives the sticker a more solid feel , like it is n't going to come off the box.I 've had Avery labels for awhile , and have liked them . These are good , I 'd buy 'em for sure .	1
These do , in fact , perform as advertised . They run through my laser printer cleanly and adhere well , blocking things underneath ( I tested it on a white box that had black sharpie on it ; the sharpie was obscured by the label 100 % ) . They are a bit small for my box-shipping needs ( I use the half-sheet labels for that ) but for mailing correspondence to the same address every month , it 's quite easy to run off the addresses on a sheet of these labels and keep them with my stamps .	1
These are nice , large shipping labels . I tried them out returning a package , and the label covered the one underneath , no problem , nothing showing through . They printed out clearly and without smudging . We 've also found other uses for them around the house , like labeling the kids ' notebooks for school . Great labels .	1
These are white shipping labels ... but THESE are good quality ones that do n't peel off . They are 2 inches x 4 inches , and come 10 labels per sheet . They can go through your printer for mass mailings using an Avery template , or you can simply peel , stick , and and write on one ... no bleeding if you use a permanent marker , either . Even if I do n't always use these for shipping , they are great stick on labels for most anything . I often will cut them up into smaller pieces for this or that purpose . And they are thick enough that you ca n't read anything underneath them ... a big plus no matter what you use them for .	1
Being an AMAZON seller , I use these 2x4 '' labels often , especially when addresses are long/tall ( e.g. , Japan ) . These are truly special , they are light yet sturdy and solid ; albeit quasi-luxurious this is super-professional , marvellous stuff .	1
I received these labels from the Amazon Vine Program , and was eager to give them a try . I 've used Avery products for many years and love that they have use common templates for printing at home.These labels are great for addressing envelopes or boxes you 've previously used . The `` TrueBlock '' technology means that there 's no show-through of the previous address . They stick securely and look professional on the front of even a used envelope . I 'll look for more of these when they 're gone . Thanks , Avery , and thanks Amazon !	1
These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct . I like to save boxes in which I have received shipments for later use to send birthday and Christmas gifts through the mail , but often they have markings and barcodes on them . In the past I have just used a heavy black marker to blot out these things . This is a much better alternative . The labels are sturdy , took printer ink well , and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them . I like any product that helps me to recycle .	1
Generally , my main complaint about labels is the poor quality glue that 's used and their inability to stick to anything other than a narrow range of paper types . Most Avery labels can stick to a wide variety of materials ranging from paper to pained surfaces to plastic and these are no exception.As advertised , they are very opaque and anything underneath will generally not show through . If you hold the label up to the light , you might be able to make out what was underneath -- but otherwise you ca n't see through it.They feed through printers without issue ( even color lasers that may snake the labels through several rollers ) and peel of cleanly.Do you need Avery labels for everything ? No , not really . But you are definitely getting a better product for the money .	1
These white shipping labels with TrueBlock technology do cover quite well . They seem to perform as stated and I am quite pleased .	1
These labels are shown on the outer package with a return address and the addressee fitting comfortably on the outside of an envelope . However , these are only 2x4 '' - trying to fit the return address as well as an address was a bit too snug for my liking.Still , I had a mass-mailing that needed to be done , so I used these labels . I enlarged the typeface and used them strictly for addressee information , afixing a smaller return address label to the top left corner of a large envelope . Instead of looking liking tiny labels on a big envelope , these labels were sizable enough to dominate the envelope well enough to stand out and be noticed - particularly important for mailing purposes.It 's always good to find other uses for labels - these were just large enough to fit another purpose very well . I have a massive library of books and those that are favorites merit a nameplate . I used clipart and created bookplates . Turned on end , they fit particularly well inside the front of books without being overly large . The labels are thick and solid enough to work without looking flimsy . I am very happy with these labels .	1
Avery labels always do a good job for me , and particularly print well with MS Word , I had no problems printing labels properly aligned and the print quality was excellent , very clear without any smudges . Recommended .	1
Sure , you can get other label brands but you ca n't get Avery QUALITY anywhere else . If you want a product that wont peel off when you do n't want it to ( like in your printer or at the post office ) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software , and one that presents well to the recipient , then stick to Avery and you wo n't be sorry . These labels are a prime example of what I 'm talking about . I often reuse large envelopes , mailers , and boxes . These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person . They are also great for sticking over bar codes and routing notes .	1
I ship a lot of items , mostly books , and I recycle as many envelopes and bubble mailers as I can . It is so time consuming to peel off old labels and/or mark through the writing on the envelopes . While this is n't a problem that ranks anywhere on the scale of actual world problems , it 's nice to have a simple solution that makes one of my tasks a bit easier.The TrueBlock technology actually works . Some of the mailers I use are pretty worn and have already had 2 or 3 labels stuck to them . One of these Avery TrueBlock labels covers all the writing underneath and looks very clean and neat . They work great ! As always , Avery offers so many free templates online that using any of their labels is so easy and convenient . There are other brands available that promise the same thing , and Avery labels are n't always the least expensive , but I find over and over that I save money in the long run by buying the Avery products because they work each and every time.I love a product that is simple but works as promised and gets the job done . These Avery TrueBlock labels are exactly that . Highly recommended !	1
I was impressed at how this label really did work to block out what was bellow it.Even heavy thick black lines did not show through.These labels may cost a bit more but I do n't have to use 2-3 labels to block was is below them so in the long run they save a lot more than the cheaper labels.They also adhere quite well.They moved through both my top and bottom feed printers with no problem .	1
Avery never fails to produce quality , easy to use labels and these are no exception . As with any Avery label , these work seamlessly with the templates built into Word . This particular type with `` TrueBlock Technology '' and be pasted right over previous labels so envelopes and boxes can be reused without having to peel off the old label . They guarantee nothing will show through ( like an old bar code ) and mess up your shipment . Nice feature and very `` green '' which I always appreciate ! Kudos , Avery !	1
Avery has done it again ! Been using their product for years and I think these are a good improvement over prior functionality.I did use the template and verified that the printing surfaces were clean and ready to go prior to use . In this way , the labels printed smoothly and easily . There was not smudging . The labels did not get stuck in the printer.As the sheet includes just labels ( no margins ) , they peeled off easily and could be subsequently appliedquickly and neatly to the packages . The finished look was neat and very professional and ready for mailing.Overall , these are terrific address labels for any user .	1
The labels print perfectly and have a decent level of stickiness . They do not seem like they would fall off at all after adhering them on to the letter . Good stuff . Just the right size to not take up too much space and to get the most for your money . A good amount per package . Avery always seems to make the best quality office supply products so you know you can never go wrong with a product of theirs . Maybe could be a little more sticky but decent .	1
Not much to really say about a label ... but they do pull off easily , so what is most important , works well .	1
Avery is just awesome ... they make a huge variety of labels that work great and this is one is not an exception . They cover up the labels underneath completely so you can recycle envelopes that people have sent you ; they stick easy and print on easily without smudging ; excellent all around ! ! ! One advantage to Avery is that you can go on their website and use the templates they have available as well.Highly recommend !	1
These labels worked beautifully in my HP2600n laser-printer . They peel cleanly and stick well.The thing that really pushes Avery labels into the `` 5 star '' category for me is the [ ... ] templates website . A full-featured online layout tool supports most Avery labels , has tons of font/typeface combinations , supports useful things like filling in the rest of your labels based on a variation of the previous one , does mail-merge , etc , etc . AND that does n't require any download -- when you 're done , it generates a PDF to print . Definitely a big win in the increasingly online-centric application world . There are downloads for MS Office and other tools available on the site , also.These labels are big , nearly double the size of what I picture as `` letter sized envelope labels '' , so unless your fonts are massive , there 's plenty of room on the label to add a graphic , or logo , or whatever . The Avery website includes a number of such graphics to add to the label.Recommended .	1
These White Shipping Labels are amazing . It is specially designed for blocking out any writing over so that you can re-use the envelop . The labels are of good quality and it peels off nicely and ready to go on the re-usable envelop . I used this few times and I am satisfied with this product .	1
useful , work great , ca n't really go wrong with these labels if this is what you need . works well with MS Word and my Epson printer .	1
These are good , standard solid labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package ( so helpful ) and I 've used both the 3M version , Avery version , and branded store versions ( like Office Depot ) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose , I 'd make your decision based on price , and features such as the TrueBlock Technology included on these ( which makes using a a recycled box or envelope much easier - it 's thicker and truly covers up the older used labels below ! ) ... as well as other features like ( is it for a LASER or INKJET - this is for LASER printers ) printer ? Is it the right adhesive ( does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using ) ... I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands , but Avery has been making good labels for a long time , so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process and the way I can re-use old boxes for mailing with these !	1
I use these for business and love the thicker ( non see through design ) . Can be used to cover old labels - no see or bleed through on these .	1
I requested these labels after trying out a set of ink jet labels that were too small to be useful . These labels are larger and easier to use . Furthermore , they can be used in either a laser printer ( best results ) or ink jet ( good results , see below ) . What is particularly nice about these labels is they are fully blocking of any printing underneath . Furthermore , one can print only the labels one needs and reuse the label page provided one prints and removes from the bottom up . Of course , one needs to use the pattern and keep track of where to start . These labels are easy to remove from the backing and attach firmly to the envelope or box.To use these in an ink jet printer , select plain paper but request high resolution printing ( 700 dpi or higher ) . This approach avoids bleeding by using smaller droplets during each pass , and enhances drying . The printing is only slightly smeared , but not enough to notice if using 12 pt type or larger .	1
These are great for reusing envelopes as they cover up everything underneath perfectly . They also print very well without jamming up .	1
These are the perfect size to cover up mis-printed envelopes . Stick very well , and you definitely ca n't see any printing through the labels . Very bright white . Prints well .	1
I wo n't bore you with a lengthy review , I mean c'mon.. they are shipping labels.They can be printed on by your printer with ease , they stick on super strong , and are of great value . 5 stars ! Get these , they work great !	1
People who know me know I love to label . These do everything that they say . Ran beautifully through my printer , stick nicely . No complaints .	1
They work great in regular printer . TRULY blocks the old stuff . Great adhesive . Excellent quality !	1
These labels are a good size for mailing first-class parcels and larger envelops . Also , they are much better quality than the off-brand labels . I am pleased .	1
These labels are of good quality and just what they should be . They print smoothly without jamming up my printer , they provide good coverage for covering up old addresses or other unwanted info and most importantly they STICK ! I hate cheap labels that require you to tape the edges down so they do n't peel off .	1
I ship a lot of books and packages in re-used envelopes and packaging . In the past , I 've always had to use an additional piece of paper , or a dark marker , to cover up the old address . That 's not the case with Avery 's shipping labels with TrueBlock technology.These amazing labels effectively cover up any existing label or writing , making it impossible to see the previous address . It might sound like a small feature , but for this shipper it 's a time-saver.And , since they 're the dependable Avery brand , I can simply enter the package number into my printing program and know that it will print the labels without fail . You ca n't go wrong .	1
These labels are great for covering old information.I frequently ship reused boxes and I do n't have to double up my labels anymore or cross out with black marker before affixing a new shipping label.In addition they print easily using them template and the adhesive is just fine which is what I 've come to from Avery .	1
Other then blocking whatever is underneath the label , these labels are no different than any other label that Avery makes . These have all the same features that you would expect from Avery . They do not come off the sheet when running through the printer , and are easy to remove from the sheet when needed .	1
These `` Avery White Shipping Labels '' are perfect for my use . Before I got these , I used two address labels on all my postage : One for the address of the person with whom I am corresponding and another for my return address.With this label I am able to fit my return address on the upper left side of the label and the shipping address on the lower right side of the label.One of the nice things about Avery products is that a person can get a template free that works well with each specific product . In this case a person can get Avery template 5163 ( template and software ) on the internet . I have used Avery templates for many years and found them perfect for the designed label ( in this case label 5263 ) .I recommend `` Avery White Shipping Labels for Laser Printers '' . This is a quality product .	1
If you like professional and uniform looking labels - and I do - then this is a great product . I have a P-Touch label maker that I have used forever to create labels for my file folders . Rather than hand-writing , I print the label , then peel the adhesive strip to the file folder and I do like that my labels have a uniform look . What detracts from this system is that my labels are printed on white , so once adhered to the file folder , the label as well as the text is clearly visible . What sets the Avery labels apart is that the label itself is clear . Thus , it is virtually invisible once it is adhered . This adds a very professional look to the labels , in addition to the uniform look.However the reason I said in the title that they are best for business use ? The label sheets can be run through your printer which will print the whole page at once . Prior to their arrival I did n't think this would be a problem , as I could just print a few , then save the sheet and next time I needed labels , print a few more . Nuh-uh . The sheet can ONLY be run through the printer one time , due to the adhesive residue on the page that will gum up the printer . This means I need to know ahead of time what labels I will need for all 50 labels ! Now granted , if I were starting a new project of some kind , that would n't be a problem . But generally I need to create only a few labels at a time - and I do n't want to wait months until I have 50 labels that need printed ! For this reason , I downgraded my rating to a 4.The software templates available online make it easy to create the labels . You can even add a graphic , such as a logo , to the label . When I saw the suggestion that you can print a label for both sides of the divider at once , I could not at first see how this would be useful . However I now realize how handy it is to have both sides of the divider labeled . Now , no matter where I am in the binder , I can easily flip to the section I need . ( This feature means I only have to wait until I need to print 25 labels , instead of 50 , before printing the whole sheet . It also means I go through twice as many labels . ) Another nice feature is that rather than having to peel and stick individual labels , it is easy to label a whole strip of five at once . You simply line them up , stick down the labels , then when you remove the `` outer '' strip , all that is left is the labels on the dividers.The dividers themselves are flimsier than I would prefer . Thicker than paper but not as rigid as a good cardstock . The corners are sharp rather than rounded . So far this has n't been a problem , although I can see them getting turned over and creased more easily . The hole side is reinforced and so far has held up well.Overall this is a good product but I do believe its best application is in a business setting where multiple labels are frequently required .	1
.. which is great ! I will echo other reviewers to say that this is good for larger jobs . For just a few tabs ... it 's just easier to write it in neatly . I like that there is a template to use with MS Word , which makes it a lot easier to use and to keep projects organized in the same folder for future duplication .	1
This us an interesting product which allows you to quickly label file folders in groups of five in one shoot . You simply line up the folders , remove the one long strip of paper from the back of the stickers and press onto the folders . This product is useful if you are completing a large storage project but would be useless if you were simply adding a folder to your groups of files .	1
As a rule I find the company makes quality products . But you need to install software to make the index spacer work and if you are in a hurry this product may be way to much work . But compared to the cheaper tags you find in most office supply stores this product is nicer looking when you get done . Just wish it were easier to use .	1
First of all , you do n't have to go to [ ... ] and register in order to download the template . You can download from Microsoft 's website . ( I accessed it quickly by searching Woord 2007 's online Help . ) Click DOWNLOAD , accept terms , follow prompts and such , then you will be prompted to enable macros in Word . Once that process is complete ( a few mins ) , you 're all set to start creating . ( You 'll want to adjust the SAVE AS option , make sure you save it in your Docs , or wherever you keep templates , otherwise it goes into a preset MS folder and you may never find it again ! ) It 's very user friendly . This is not your most basic Avery label , where you insert directly onto the template . Rather , you insert text and photos from a separate on-screen window . You can add different pictures on each tab ( left or right position , easy Browse and Insert from Your Pictures ) or the same pic on all tabs . Same with text . Click `` OK '' to view template , and if you need to edit , click `` EDIT TEXT OR PICTURES '' on the toolbar and the screen returns . Changes are made quickly enough , with a visible progress bar . Fonts can be easily tested out and edited - ctrl+a to select all on the actual template , then scroll through several preset fonts to see the changes before your eyes without final editing , then click the one you like best to make the changes final . You can also access and use MSWord 's full set of installed fonts by clicking `` Create New Theme Fonts '' and saving as Custom.The template automatically prints in BLACK , size 14 . What I have not found is how to quickly change the entire page 's font COLORS and SIZES . The only way that has worked for me is to select the text on each individual label and then apply a new color or size from Word HOME ( off the Avery template toolbar , back onto the Word toolbar ) . I have tried several tricks , nothing has worked . This is unfortunate , as color coding can be an extremely helpful and effective way to access specific tabbed sections of information.The template screen gives you the option to start on any row you choose , which is a great way to conserve template sheets , since you may not use every label on the sheet every time . You can print more than one set at a time and then Collate or Group.Overall I really like these , and I will forgive the color and size faux pas for now . But these options would be a nice update to the label for future editions .	1
I 'm loving how the rings are the connecting to each other with the pin . That is such a better idea over other binders out there . also the ease of how they open and the side mounted binder instead of the back panel . So much better.The printable tabs are a great little add as well . I can redo them as I like and I can even handwrite on them as well . Plus the fact that all you have to do it line up over your set of tabs and just push them down . Makes life so much easier in general ... ..This is the perfect item for those of us with a little OCD when it comes to organizational issues ... lolall binders should have the level of quality that this product offers .	1
These dividers are good for general use.PROS : -- Durable -- Professional looking -- Convenient labelsCONS : -- Not much different from other dividers -- A bit expensiveRecommended for professional use . If you just need a set of dividers , these are much too expensive . You could easily improvise using cheaper labels and dividers .	1
I recvd Avery lavel dividers and heavy duty EZD ring binder . Cool.Over the years I 've printed out many a label via Avery to use on their dividers . Both the labels and templates are easy-peasy . One template prints a row of labels together ; the other individual labels . Templates are at Avery.com . Easy to download and use ... Clean , crisp printing w/ jet printer . No more guessing if the labels are loaded correctly ... The dividers are white and strong.Now the EZD Ring binder is very impressive ... The info says it holds over 600 pages ... And it really is one-touch ... It has sleeves front and back on the inside . And clear sleeves on the front , back and side on the outside . The better to label and see what you 're looking for ... Nice ...	1
How exciting can tabs or index dividers be ? Well , pretty darn exciting.These Clear Label Index-Maker ( r ) Dividers are innovative and needed . They let you label five tabs at once using a special label strip . But more than that , they come with directions ( step-by-step directions for those with feeble computer skills like mine ! ) and even a demo on how to use them . You can access it at avery.com/demo.im.I also love that they 're making the dividers from 30 % post-cnsumer recyled paper and offer free templates and software , too -- for about every program and computer imaginable . See the Avery address for that on the package.I ca n't help myself . I 'm , also going to plug the heavy duty , easy-to- open binder from Avery . It 's PVC Free and the chipboard it 's made from is 100 % recycled content.Both products are community conscious with official Box Tops Education labels on them.Are the Avery folks first in making label use easy ? Could be . They sure enough do know how to make a product right and then to market it in ways that count. -- -The reviewer is the author of the multi award-winning HowToDoItFrugally series of books for writers and retailers .	1
Over the course of the year , I create presentation packets , and one of the more tedious tasks is labeling the tabs . This Avery product saves me time in that it allows me to label all my tabs at once using the enclosed label strip ( which has guides on it to allow proper placement on the tabs ) . The design is a time saver and the guides work well.The drawback to this is that Avery 's instructions tell you to only feed the label sheet once through your printer , so , with 5 sets of 5 tabs each , you really need to have a bigger project/multiple packets to optimally use these labels.Avery also includes a label sheet for sticking individual labels one at a time onto the tabs ( but again , the assumption is that the label sheet is to be feed through the printer as a one time only sheet ) .The Avery website is easy to navigate and the Avery templates are easy to use.This is a great product for my use . I recommend these if you are putting together multiple presentation packets .	1
Love , love , love these . When providing student materials , they help give the documentation a professional , sleek look . They are a little hard to use until you get used to them , but I would definitely recommend them .	1
This is a really nice addition to a filing system . The tabs are easy to use and they look so nice in the file . The added bonus of the binder was neat , I did n't expect that .	1
This was a great product to give your index dividers a professional touch . Clean , crisp and transparent labels looked like something you 'd get from a quality print shop and far beyond that of the typical SOHO user . Unfortunately , the product is really designed to print a page of 100 labels at a time . Printing just a few simply is n't a good use of this product as the paper does become harder to feed in the printer over time and aligning a small set of labels proved difficult.To print the labels , you open up a Microsoft Word template and manually type on the labels you want to print on . For just a few labels for office use , this was simply more trouble than it was worth . However , I did create a series of client presentations and the labels were invaluable for that.Highly recommend for your next project , but skip it for daily use	1
These dividers were just what the teacher ordered for organizing my high school student 's binder . The instructions were clear and easy to follow , the resulting labels look terrific and the dividers are sturdy enough to last the whole school year . The five sets in the package make it a great deal . The only thing that could have made this a five star review was having multi colors versus white only .	1
These are great labels to have around . They fit on most folders that I wanted them to . Personally I thought full price they would be expensive but they are worth getting when on sale	1
Avery has consistently made great products and this one is no exception . The product allows me to easily and neatly label all of my tabs ( and in many cases relabel them for reuse ) . The quality and the the way they accept the printed items are great like usual . I do occasionally have issues with the templates , but have experienced similar issues with every brand of labels I have used . I would highly recommend this to those that like to keep everything neatly organized .	1
I 'm not exactly sure what I am reviewing , since Avery sent a special kit to the Vine reviewers that consisted of a 1.5 '' Heavy-Duty One Touch EZD 3-ring binder and the tabs.The EZD binder is made very well , with an easy to use ring locker.The Easy Apply tabs come in strips of 5 that allow you to label 5 tabs in one fast stroke , perfect for the office commandos that need to file stuff on a daily basis . The kit also comes with a tab sheet that allows you to print tabs using a Word template . All of these tabs are self-adhesive , so it saves you time from having to hunt down lost inserts.Avery comes up with nifty ways of organizing information and this is not an exception .	1
This binder comes with clear label index maker dividers . Microsoft Word can be used to print on all the label strips with the computer . When you print the labels , peel and align on the divider definitely looks more professional . It can be used for home filing , school papers or office . It is easy and less time-consuming compared to writing all the labels by hand . Label seems thick and index divider sheets are also thick . Strip that is holding the ring is thick to hold the ring strongly . It has 2 pockets on each inner side in the binder where we can keep some additional papers or pen .	1
Trust your eyes when you go to the Avery website : the first 11436 template is a 4 column template but download the one that has five columns instead . When you go to the next screen on the five column template and view details , the numbers 11436 will show up.Usually things have disclaimers about how they wo n't work on Macs ( it either wo n't line up , wo n't open the pdf , or requires a rocket scientist ) . This product did not say there would be a Mac problem until AFTER you download the template . Then and only then does it clearly state that there will be a problem with Word 2008 and Macs . Since my computer 's default always ignores Word 2008 and goes back to an earlier version , I thought it would be fine . LOL ! Not quite . Generally , I do n't click agree on anything that says `` trust all documents from this publisher . '' Compile error in hidden module : blah blah blah was my second alert . The next problem was that the template had a box of text over it and that led to my second compile error in hidden module . I was able to get rid of the box by first deleting the text and then selecting the box and cutting it . It is hardly ever easy to use things with Macs but generally Avery has been compatible so I was surprised by this . And no , it was not a huge difficulty to get past these problems , just annoying.I liked that Avery included a practice sheet . I 'm the type that always has to practice to see which side and up or down something is going to be printed on to print twice on the same page . It seems like at some point I should learn that about my printer but I never like to get that attached to any printer . ( At some point , a tiny part is going to break or it will be cheaper to buy a new printer than to replace the inks . ) Once you get past the template difficulties , the divider labels went on very easily ! I loved how they lined up ! I put the dividers in a binder first so they were all perfectly set up.I used the set that was sent to me to organize gym junk . I have a bunch of binders and systems that needed to be put all together in one place . Now I can just pull the sections that I want to take to the gym on any given day instead of my old system where I just took the first binder I could find in the trunk.Once I worked out the kinks , it was all fine . But I 've had other Avery products without kinks and I like those better . Much better .	1
The package that Avery sent Vine reviewers is n't the same as the one you buy , so it took a while to figure out what is usually delivered . The heavy duty binder is n't included , so I wo n't cover that in this review . The labels included are extremely easy to use , and work flawlessly with Microsoft Word and the Avery templates . These were some of the easiest printer labels I 've used in terms of getting the software and templates to work properly.The results are impressive and definitely compare to print-shop quality ( especially if you 're printing with a laser ) , so for professional presentations , quotations and RFPs , they provide a fast way to get good-looking results . For projects that do n't require that level of finish , they are really too expensive to use on a day-to-day basis , especially since there are so many labels on the page . After 2-3 feeds through my laser printer , the paper did n't feed so well.Overall a little pricey , but the quality is outstanding for those times you want professional-grade custom tabs .	1
First , I 'm a Mac user and the template download did n't have one labeled for Microsoft version 2008 but 2007 worked just fine . Next , figuring out which way it goes in the printer . Thanks to the handy practice sheet I got it in a couple of tries . Would n't it be great if you could put in your printer make and model and it would tell you which way the paper goes . One of the slickest features of Clear Label is being able to apply labels to all five tabs `` at once . '' After lining up the tabs and the strip , you can apply them all at once but to remove the remainder of the strip requires a little fiddling with each label ... at least they all got positioned perfectly and that 's the important point . Maybe they could make them break apart just a little easier.Where you need to follow my directions instead of theirs is if you are applying labels to both sides of each tab . Unlike the example Avery supplies , you do n't want to just type the labels two up . For the second set , you 'll want to reverse the order . Otherwise you wo n't be able to take advantage of the `` Easy Apply Label Strip '' and you 'll be back to peeling them off one by one and hoping you can line them up . I did n't figure this out on the first batch but it worked well on the second.The end result is a very nice looking set of tabs and knowing they are made from 30 % recycled paper helps too ... especially when I read today that global climate change has already killed off 40 % of the phytoplankton in the Earth 's oceans and I happen to know that historically , half of the world 's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis . Whatever Avery can do to further cut down or indicate their carbon footprint would be appreciated . I 'm sure these labels do n't contribute much but every breath may soon count a great deal , especially for our grandchildren .	1
I was impressed that this product came with the binder as well , I thought it was just the dividers , but it also came with the binder . Great quality , highly recommend .	1
**Amazon Vine customers who ordered the Avery Index Maker Clear Label Dividers with Easy Apply Label Strip , White Tabs , 5 Tabs per Set , 5 Sets per Pack ( 11436 ) received the bonus of a binder with the label dividers . It is my understanding that the binder is not a part of the package , so I will not describe the binder . **The first thing I did after opening the package was make two copies of the Easy Apply Practice Sheet because I wanted to test print directly from the template and not print on a plain piece of paper and hold it against the practice sheet as recommended . I wanted to see it directly on the form . Because the label sheet can go through a printer only 1 time , be sure you have enough ink in your printer , especially if you 're printing in color . Would be rotten luck to run out of ink halfway through the job . Now 50 labels may seem like a lot , but if you 're printing for an office or conference , that 's a drop in the bucket . If you 're looking to print a row or two , this is not the best product for you . This is suitable for larger projects which require repetitive applications and can save over the cost of having dividers professionally printed . What makes this product different is that you print a sheet of labels , remove a strip then apply the labels onto 5 tabs with one movement . You can reverse the process for labels on the reverse of each tab , hence the 50 labels on a sheet for 25 tabs . The instructions on the back of the sheet direct the user to move from left to right in peeling , pressing and removing the strip , but I see no reason it ca n't be done from right to left because the margins are the same on both ends . I became a little nervous when reading the instructions and saw , `` professional-lookin g dividers '' , not a very professional look with the error in spelling . Made me question all aspects of the product since there was an error in Avery 's professional printing . Anyway , I was impressed by the Avery website and template options available , and I also enjoyed playing around with the Design Pro offered from the website , especially for a Mac computer . I designed my labels in color , ran a couple of tests , making the necessary adjustments in design and alignment , printed the labels with baited breath , and enjoyed the application process which was very fast and efficient . The sheets are very white and crisp , have nice sharp corners , and the rounded tabs are nested together beautifully with no empty space between them . I 'm now trying to come up with another project to purchase more .	1
I used these to organize my recipe collection . They are easy to use , sturdy , and do just the trick . Nothing not to like about them .	1
The computer program you use to print these labels is very easy to use . Only complaint is that if you do n't like one thing on the test paper you print , you have to re-enter all the headings . Other than that , very nice ! Results are great . Vary the size , text style , etc . to suit you . Recommended for easy , neat , nice-looking tabs .	1
This is the first set of dividers I have come across that you can print on for multiple categories at once . The dividers fit a standard 3 ring binder . You print your labels on a strip that can then be applied to 5 dividers at once ( must be aligned ) .Another great Avery product .	1
My previous experience with Avery printable labels was less than satisfactory . I 'm very pleased with these labels , however.One thing to be aware of : the product cover which notes that the `` guarantee extends only to a sheet of labels that has been fed through a printer a single time '' . Initially I 'd planned to use these labels and dividers for my son 's school binder , which contains only 5 subjects , but since each sheet of label strips contains 25 labels ( 5 rows of 5 ) and can only be run through the one time , it would have been a waste.For personal use , I ca n't think of other similarly large projects for which I 'd need 25 labels at a time . I imagine these would be wonderful in an office , though , or perhaps come tax season when it 's time to organize receipts ? I wound up using this to label my large , hyper-organized recipe binder and the results look stunning ! Also , the Avery template software available for download at their site made it very easy to print labels for both the front and back of the dividers , which means I can find my way around my cookbook from either end now . Nice ! That said , I wish the directions encouraged users to wait several minutes after printing before they apply the labels . Since I did n't , the ink on the first few smeared when I pressed them onto the dividers . By the second row , I knew better and the remaining labels turned out gorgeous .	1
I choose this Avery product because I have been pleased with their products in the past . I was not disappointed ! It 's easy to go online , type in the number of the product , test it and then print . The user can choose between programs that can be downloaded or used online . I was using a computer other than my own so I went for the online program . It had a good number of choices and clear instructions . My only problem was that a small amount of the design on each label was cut off . It did n't really detract from the product and I probably could have changed it after my test copy if I had wanted.If you have any problems , there are several resources to find help including `` help '' tabs on each page , online chat and phone numbers . I also like that this product is made of 30 % post consumer products.BEST OF ALL it is easy to apply 5 labels at once . With the arthritis in my hands , this is a major plus !	1
I really wanted to review this but since I received a binder instead , I ca n't honestly say I 've used these labels . Vine mixed up my order . Oh well . The Avery Durable View Binder with 2 '' EZ-Turn Ring 17032 is nice , too . Vine shows it in white but I got a dark blue one .	1
In a previous job , it was my task to get books printed , most of which needed custom tabs . Unfortunately , having custom tabs printed cost an arm and a leg . Because I was on a budget , I was forced to use those tabs where you type on the little strip and shove it into a plastic sleeve on the divider . This was affordable , but it looked cheap and cheesy and I searched high and low for a better option . Now that I 'm no longer ordering custom workbooks , a solution to my tab problem has arrived.First off , Avery Index Maker Clear Label Dividers are EASY . If you can fill out a form , you have all the skills necessary to make custom tabs . The back of the package gives you instructions to find the software that works with either your word processor or as a stand alone program . Install the software ( which takes no time at all ) , fill out your information , and print out your spiffy custom tabs . Align the label strip to the blank tabs , press into place and remove the excess plastic . It takes longer to read my overly-long sentence than it did to make some tabs ! I gave the product five stars , but I almost gave it four , mostly because you need to install software to make the index spacer work . Every company I 've worked for in the past fifteen years imposes strict sanctions against installing software yourself , and waiting for IT to approve and install it takes a long time . ( Because they have so much to do ) I ended up giving the product five stars because Microsoft Word is nearly ubiquitous , and this label template is included with Microsoft Word . Just load the template and go.Great product , makes professional looking tabs , and saves tons of money over having custom tabs printed . Just do n't let your boss know how easy it is or you 'll be making custom tabs all day long !	1
In the early days of my company we would work like mad to make up proposal section separation sheets that indicated the quality and professional that we were trying to present with our proposals . We finally gave up and purchased separate stiff sheets that were professional printed with the desired section title ; i.e. , Personnel , Technical Understanding , Approach , etc . Invariably the government would change the section titles every time we started a new proposal , so there were no scale economies available to `` over stocking '' separation sheets.Had I had this Avery product available , it would be an simple task to change proposal section titles to match the latest government desires , yet still have a professional looking proposal . What a tremendous idea . Well worth the cost and simple to implement .	1
This is an excellent product that makes an ordinarily tedious job much easier . The trick is the `` Easy Apply label strips , '' which allow you to print all five index tab labels at one time using a Word template that Avery makes available online . Once they 're printed , you just peel the group of labels off of the sheet and press the labels onto the folder tabs . There 's also a set of individual labels if you do n't need sets of five . It takes less time to do it than it takes to read this explanation . The dividers themselves seem very sturdy , and they should survive pretty rough handling in a notebook.A new way of doing divider tab labels is n't going to change the world , but this Avery product makes life just a little easier . Bottom line : Well worth the money .	1
I think most people who use office products are familiar with the Avery brand and the normally high quality of their products . This product is no exception.My husband has to put together frequent and spontaneous binders for his customers . These need to be low cost but professional . I 'm happy to say this product makes the task quick , easy and inexpensive .	1
Avery is one of the best companies ! They came through again with these dividers . I used these in my portfolio and it came out awesome ! I will continue to buy Avery prodcuts for my work related projects . Avery never disappoints you with the quality of their products !	1
If you have a project that requires creating lots of binder dividers , this kits is just the thing ! You 'll save lots of time printing and labeling your dividers . If you just need the occasional divider , it 's not really worth the expense , it 's definitely best for situations where you have a good many of dividers to label .	1
These work great and make it very easy to put together multiple dividers ( front and back ) at a time . The added bonus is that I am able to get them all on straight because I have a longer line to follow as I am attaching them . I only wish I did not have to use the Avery website to print the labels . They used to supply a disk with previous purchases I have made and the disk included the application needed . I wish I could just download the app to my system so I did not have to learn how to navigate their website . Too complicated for just the few labels I want to print.Overall if you are putting together lots of labels it could be worth your time . There was also the ability to add graphics to the labels .	1
We use this with a 2 inch Avery binder to keep all our finances and household affairs in order . The tabs are great to quickly customize categories that need to be specific . More useful than pre-printed tabs that just say BANK , HOME , AUTO , etc . Very easy to set up , print and use .	1
This product is worth the money for those preparing dividers for a large volume of binders . The clever design of the tab labels allows the user to apply all 5 labels in the 5 divider set simultaneously and then peel off the connective piece leaving all 5 labels in place . For anyone that has meticulously placed each label on dozens or hundreds of dividers getting ready for a business meeting , or creating a conference folder , for example , this can make a huge difference in time . As well , the labels all go on straighter and more professionally . Nice innovation ! It is also nice that enough labels are included with the dividers to put the labels on the front and the back of the dividers . **It 's important to note though , that if putting the labels on the front and the back , the ones for the back need to be printed in the backwards order than the ones for the front . ** They do not illustrate this on their materials , and if it was in the instructions , I did n't see it ! This is important because there are n't extras and if it 's done without that switch , the backs will have to be hand applied , negating the time savings ! These labels are really best for those doing all 5 sets in the package at the same time , because making multiple runs though a printer with the same label sheet can be unreliable . Also , setting it up multiple times negates much of the time savings as well.The package also comes with standard tab labels that can be applied singly . All the labels can be handwritten as well.Recommended for those doing volume labeling . Those labeling a few sets or a single sit can probably find a cheaper version .	1
Easy to use . Word 2010 has the template already installed , so it was quick and simple to print and create tabs for a presentation at work.With the labels all connected on a strip it is much easier to apply them squarely onto all the tabs . It is also much quicker than peeling small clear labels and attempting to apply them neatly to each individual tab .	1
This divider/label kit helps you step by step through the process of printing labels for your dividers , either with a downloaded Word template ( which I used , with Word 2003 ) or online . ( Word 2007 comes with the template already , according to the package . ) Once you download it , it will appear under an `` Avery '' tab when you open the `` New Office Document '' menu . I tried printing both text and picture labels , and fed the label sheet twice through the printer - it came out looking great and was as easy to apply as in the photo . You can also print labels for both the fronts and backs of your tabs at the same time . There is even a test printing sheet as well as extra labels to attach separately in case you want to reuse old dividers . The binder is also very nice , with a rubber-coated lever and two pockets inside both the front and back covers .	1
This review is for theAvery Index Maker Clear Label Dividers with Easy Apply Label Strip , White Tabs , 5 Tabs per Set , 5 Sets per Pack ( 11436 ) ( Office Product ) Much like another reviewer , we have a Mac system . I decided upon Macs because much of what we do is architecture , art and design work . If you use binders , Avery has a fine system . We probably use fewer because most of Our presentations are done on our Lap Tops and our specifications and sketches come out of our design system in perfect order.We went through a series of errors and restarts to finally arrange a means of having the Avery system act compatible with the Mac . The process on a Mac was time consuming and a bit frustrating , but we finally achieved a sort of parity between Mr. Job 's toys and Avery's.Fortunately , Avery included a practice sheet . I needed it , but most of the problems involved the Template sheet after that was resolved the divider labels were a cinchThe system Avery suggests is to print labels , align them against tabs , smooth down labels and peel the strip . The Easy Apply ( tm ) label strips help you apply multiple labels in and with their free templates at [ ... ] , you can use your inkjet or laser printer to produce prints hop-quality , customized tab labels with sharp text . Just print , peel and press.They also advocate that Dividers can be customized with content , color and graphics* Clear labels virtually disappear when applied to divider tabs , so your text and graphics pop* Durable tabs resist tearing and stand up to frequent use* Tabs can be labeled on both front and back for easy reference.All of that is correct , so if you need to use binders , the Avery system turns out very professional looking binders , forms and pages .	1
I have used lots of tabs over the years , and these are a great , improved version from Avery - the tabs are a good paper thickness , look professional , and you can either write on them ( I 'd recommend using a Sharpie ) or you can print the labels easily yourself . Avery has nice templates to create these index labels - I 'd still suggest a test print or two ( hence the 4 star rating ) because sometimes they might print a bit off , so testing is always ideal . But I 've not yet found a time when this is n't the case , so it 's just a normal inconvenience of printing nice , professional-looking labels yourself . I would definitely recommend this product from Avery , and have purchased many of these for use in my job - they are great ! I would like to suggest Avery make these in 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , and 15 tab versions - I believe they do all except the 10 tab ... which I like , but I would still recommend these !	1
You can count on Avery to bring to market an excellent heavy-duty three-ring binder that can be depended upon to be easy-to-manipulate and hold-up to the abuse inherent in office work.I particularly like the plastic cover over the push tab to use open-and-close the rings to place the dividers and paper in . With free templates and software to make the index tab dividers and a study 3-ring binder to put materials in this is a good , solid , dependable product . The rings themselves appear to match up perfectly.Bottom line ? Buy this heavy duty 3-ring binder you wo n't have to struggle ever again to open and close the rings like you do on most .	1
Getting divider labels to look good has been one of my challenges . If you need dividers for presentations or just to look good it 's almost impossible to get most labels to print out with the right alignment . Others I 've tried I had to waste a whole sheet to get a couple of labels printed.These clear labels with the templates worked fantastic . The templates , printing , and results were flawless . The dividers themselves are tough , reinforced , bright white , and very crisp . I make binders and presentation materials that I can be proud of - and for my sales efforts help me win by being a notch better than my competitors . One of the few products that I use consistently and would not think of changing from .	1
This 3 Ring Binder is well designed . Avery took what is wrong with most other binders and came up with excellent solutions such as the Pins for the Binder Ring connections . Other binders use V connections which do n't always work well . I also like the Single Button to release the Rings . The curvature of the Rings makes it easier to handle large volumes of paper.The Labels are also Premium quality but I wo n't be using them with a printer or the free Avery software . Only reason is that I do n't make that many Binder labels at any one time . But I have used other Avery label products with Avery 's free software and they always worked well.If you want an above average 3 Ring Binder that can be used frequently and smoothly then I highly recommend this Avery product .	1
Oh my Avery , how I LOVE you ! ! I am a total neat freak and obsessed with file organization within my home as well as at the office . I use other Avery label products to label my hanging folders , which this product is n't really good for because those have the little tabs that get shoved into the plastic clip . I also have subfolders within my hanging folders ( your basic 3-tab folder ) , and again , these labels are n't good for those either because those folders have a much wider labelling area . So , minus a star for not being able to use these economically with other folders . Of course , if you wanted to use these on your basic 3-tab folder , you could ... but the label itself is not very long and you would n't be utilizing the wider space on the 3-tab folders tab ... plus these cost too much to do that . These are designed for 5-tab folder systems.Ok , now that I got my gripes out of the way ... on to the good stuff ! Avery states you should go to their website and download the template ( 11436 ) to print these bad boys correctly . I did not need to do that as both of my word processing software packages already had the template and it worked perfectly ( I have Microsoft Word 2007 and OpenOffice.org ) . Something I am a bit confused about , my package of trial labels came with 2 different label sheets that utilize 2 separate templates . The first one is the one you see in the product image ( 11436 ) , the one that makes applying 5 labels at a time a breeze ( sheet contains 50 labels ) ... .the second one looks more like your typical label sheet ( template 612797 ) and contains 80 labels divided into 4 columns of 20 . Again , both Word and OpenOffice had this 2nd template and printed perfectly ! ( note template 612797 is exact same as Avery Template 5836 ) Others have complained stating they were unable to put the label through their printer for 2nd or even 3rd times making these a one-time-use sheet . I did experience problems putting the label through a 2nd time on my inkjet printer , but no problems at all on my laser printer . This I ca n't explain , but it is good news for me because now I do n't have to print all 50 labels at one time or throw away the sheet if I only did print a few.No other reviews that I have read have stated how much text can be placed on the label . This I find important , so hopefully me telling you helps . Using your standard Times New Roman font , size 12 , you can fit 23 characters across and on 2 lines ... .so 46 characters total . This of course changes if you adjust the font type and size , or if you put an image on the label ( yes , you can do that and it is awesome ! ! ) .These also come with a 2 '' 3-ring binder that has the vinyl overwrap on the exterior to insert a page on the front or back ( I received a black one , but who knows if that is standard , or if colors are random ) . The interior has 3 built-in pockets on the front & back ( so 6 total ) that are stacked evenly adding to the organizational appearance . The binder has a rubber pull-tab to open/close the binder rings , which are D-shaped making turning pages and storing the binder closed less stressful on the holes of the paper in the binder.To start filling up that fancy binder and have a place to stick the labels , Avery includes a set of 25 3-hole-punched dividers . These are white and have a reinforced plastic stripping over the label tab as well as along the side where the holes are punched ( preventing them from being torn out of the binder or wearing out prematurely ) . The dividers are thicker than your standard paper , but no where near the quality of say cardstock . Shame on you Avery for creating such a wonderful label process with crappy quality dividers.If I have n't said enough already , let me say some more things . I personally love these labels , but can see where others would n't . You need to have a `` need '' for these labels or they will be a waste of your time & money . My co-workers laugh at me when I 'm on `` another labelling mission '' , but when it comes time that they need a document and they ca n't find it in their poorly organized desks ... who do you think they come to ?	1
I have always disliked binders since I was in high school . It has been so hard to open one up to put index tabs and pages in , not to mention the pinched fingers I seem to get when opening one up . When I received this binder I could n't stop opening and shuting it because it was so EASY to do . I really like the 5 tab Label Dividers . I am going to make a family journal and this is perfect to start with my pages , then go to my grandparents on my Father 's side , then my Mothers side and on to Great Grandparents . The 5 tabs per set will give me just what I 'm going to need to work my Family Journal up ! How easy can this be to accomplish what has been nagging at me for so long not quite knowing how to put it together . I will be able to use pictures with the journaling as well ! Avery has made this possible for me to now know how to do my Family Journal and also to easily put each of my children and grandchildren one together . I went onto Avery 's site to look at the labels I can get by just downloading to Microsoft Word or to Adobe Reader . Thank you Amazon Vine !	1
This index label system is simple to use . I have to admit to being a little intimidated with trying to affix five labels simultaneously , but it 's a lot easier than it looks . To help keep the dividers from shifting when applying the labels , I placed them in a three-ring binder.Even though I only have a simple inkjet printer , the labels ended up looking professionally printed and do n't smear , which seems surprising on something transparent.There 's a drawback , though , in that the label sheets are only supposed to , based on the manufacturer 's directions , be fed through the printer once . This means printing 50 labels out . This is reasonable for office use , but for general home project/home office use , one-copy reports , and the like , it 's too many . For example , I was printing labels and only needed 10 labels total for the two separate projects I was working on.While it 's a great product , you ideally need to either have large projects to use the labels for , or plan ahead for printing out labels for multiple projects at once .	1
The binder is a nice quality easy-touch 3-ring . But what makes this set especially nice is the dividers . Included are 5 sets of 5 , with one set of traditional labels , one set of `` easy labels , '' and one practice sheet . Templates are downloadable from Avery.The easy-tabs ensure that the divider labels align , which is a nice touch . I 'm going to see if I can pick these up in colored labels -- that would be sweet and perfect for how I use this product ( essentially a career portfolio ) .	1
No issues , the product worked great , and fulfilled out need for label making . Would recommend to others in need of this type of product .	1
Not only did I use these for notebook dividers , I used them to label file folders . They fit and look great with some minor adjustments ( putting one folder inside another ) . One of the nicest aspects of using these for dividers is the straight placement . I think they look much nicer than anything I 've used before . I have several notebooks that have over 25 dividers , so the time I saved creating and applying the labels is very much appreciated . I also took advantage of the fact that I could play around with section titles to see which would fit best.Avery labels are about all I can get either at my local Staples and Wal-Mart stores . ( I do n't even know who else makes them anymore . ) I 'll be buying these again .	1
First of all , unless you are in Vine , you DO NOT receive a binder with these dividers . So disregard any comments about a binder in reviews when considering ordering this product.Printing them was simple as was applying them in the strips of 5 makes quick and easy work of getting the dividers ready . The ink from my Canon inkjet did not smear at all.These dividers are great for large projects that you want to look professional . However , the biggest drawback is that you must print all 50 of the clear labels at once . This is fine if you have multiple presentations but makes it difficult to for smaller projects unless you want to write on the tabs , which defeats the purpose of getting printable tabs . In short , this product is fantastic for making up presentation binders for a business , but will not be useful for setting up binders for your kids for school ( since they are unlikely to need 50 dividers at once ) . I would not use them for my own home use , but will buy more for my business.I gave this 4 stars in relation to using it for larger projects .	1
I love the binder ... ONE thumb open/close ... .you ca n't pinch your fingers in as you close ... .yeah ! How many times have I done that in my many , many binders . Not anymore . The index maker labels are a nice construction . I hate it when you have to tape the actual dividers because they are falling apart ... ..not with these ... .very nicely put together . Overall , a very nice product .	1
It looks like Avery sent Amazon Vine a special packet consisting of a thick binder and printer labels . This included a letter from Avery to Vine reviewers.The labels are durable . Easy to peel off . Great product for people looking to organize paperwork at home or in th office .	1
i was looking for a good book stand for a while , i 'm happy i found this one . tried it with a big hard cover book and it holds nicely . it 's light and neat , and it easily folds for easier storage or transportation . i love it	1
I used various book stands similar to these for several years , until I got my big desk , and I needed something to hold BIG books open . For that I got four of the deluxe book stands in wood , which could hold the largest study Bible . But now , that BIG desk is filled with monitors , and I have far less room for beefy book stands . Enter these small stands which , by the way , are perfect for Kindles , and which can fold away when not in use . They have an air of delicacy , but if you use them carefully , they have an important role in the changing face of bookpropology .	1
I like this . It holds books well . It is holding up well and gets the job done . It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read . Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback . The flipklip is great for doing that . This one is more of a `` I have to type from a textbook onto my computer '' kind of thing . It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary . This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot , for learning to type and it holding the book open , for hardbacks that you just do n't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you , things like that .	1
Golly , I 'm so grateful I found this on Amazon . It just arrived yesterday , ordered two days prior , God love Prime ! I had another one for years , which I somehow misplaced . Its flexibility makes it more than just a medium-sized book holder . On the surface , it seems to be good only for your average NASB-sized hardback Bible ( about an inch thick ) . So the rest of this review is about how ELSE you use this thing.Right now , as I type , I 've got the left 'hook ' hanging over my flat-panel monitor . So the thing is hanging by that left hook , diagonally ( askew ) , and upside down . The back long 'legs ' are folded out , so think of the thing as in standing position.. but upside down . A plastic clamp ( could use even a big paper clip ) holds a bunch of papers together , for input ( about 10 ) . So this 'sturdy stand ' also acts like a monitor clamp at eye-level , without the adhesive and flimsy plastic holders which so easily break . The stand 's rubber feet protect the metal ends from harming the monitor ; frankly , the one hanging off the monitor is n't even touching the screen . So two vital uses , not just one.You can also use the thing to prop up large/heavy books . Or , to hold any size book yet allow you to turn the pages . So , now it props up my huge Shakespeare book ( about 2 '' thick ? ) , also here in Amazon , by Royal Shakespeare Company . Or , ponderous short 3-inch ( maybe 2+ ? ) notebooks . You just use the stand differently . [ A European style X-shaped dish rack , especially wood , is also useful . ] How ? Again , upside down . I put the Shakespeare book on a mat , turned the 'sturdy stand ' upside down and turned the back legs TOWARD each other . Could use a rubber-like place mat , if reading from a table . Something to give more traction for a heavy book . Much better than your typical book holder , because it tilts backwards , and the upside down 'hooks ' add support.Okay , so now suppose you do n't need to read a book . You can fold the thing sideways and store it just about anywhere.. or , you can HANG it , using the forward 'hooks ' for clothing , accessories , you-name-it.That 's a lot of sturdy value , for five bucks . In fact , why did I buy only one ? My bad !	1
I thought this was going to be something else and was prepared to send it back , but then discovered it is the perfect size to hold an iPad . The iPad can fit on the stand either horizontally or vertically and the stand is sturdy enough so it does n't cave in when using the iPad to play games .	1
This is a very cool product made with just three pieces of stainless steel.It folds up into a very small space and holds a small to medium sized book in a near-vertical , open-face position with a certain panache.But if you 're working from a very thick book , you need a different bookstand . The convenience disappears when you have to be finessing some of the pages of a large book onto the outside of the vertical 'placeholder ' and the rest of them on the inside.I like the idea . 'Shame they do n't make a large size , too .	1
As a student , this came in very handy . I was studying coding so looking at my textbook and typing the code on the computer was getting tedious . This stand helped make it so much easier . It 's sturdy and folds practically flat so when I 'm not using it , I just stick it between my books . Thanks , Fellowes !	1
Excellent little book stand for the desk - but will hold a book no more than 1-1/2 '' thick , so do n't expect it to hold a dictionary . It 's made of heavy solid wire and is sturdy and stable . A good value .	1
Smaller than I expected but it works just fine for what I purchased it for .	1
I 've used one of these for decades , all the way back to my university days , and it 's definitely an old and dear friend . So much so that I recently bought a new one when the little rubber tips finally wore out on the old one.This book holder works really well for any kind of hardback , even a big dictionary . However , in my experience it does n't work very well for trade paperbacks . They flop forward and do n't hold at all well . If you want a really wonderful book holder for that purpose , I recently discovered theBookbax ( which is also good for holding the Kindle and Kindle Fire and other tablet readers ) .	1
I wanted something I could put on a table top to use for my guitar lesson book and it 's perfect . It holds the book open , the legs are adjustable to make the posts that hold the book open wider or closer together . It folds flat to take with you though I have n't needed to do this yet.Terrific price for a very handy product . Beats having to move a music stand around the house .	1
This product is perfect what I intended . It is light weight and I can pack it in my computer bag . Gone are the days when I used to struggle to hold books and type from them while at my laptop . I can put this at any angle of preference . Great buy ! Great Product !	1
I often take notes and quotes from the books I 'm reading . It was always a hassle trying to keep the book open to the page I was typing from . This light weight stand does the trick . Inexpensive , easy to keep with you , and very effective for holding a book in place at the page you need it at . Love this simple tool . Very helpful .	1
I have used this stand to hold knitting and crocheting books to look at the patterns , and also to hold magazines . I have a neck injury and try not to look down at whatever I 'm reading , so this stand works great . The two little legs can be adjusted in or out depending on the size and weight of what 's in it . Right now I 'm using it to hold a magazine that I read during breakfast .	1
I like the idea that you can lay this copy stand flat and store it when not in use , and that you can even put a book in the brackets and it will hold it open while you type . ( they give you around 1 1/2 inches ) . I also like that it 's simple in it 's design , all metal with plastic end pieces . The one flaw with this is that they need a piece going up through the center and topping it by about five inches since regular paper just folds over the top of the stand . I did remedy this by putting a metal ruler through it and it works fine . But even so , what was Fellowes thinking when they designed it ? Just that one piece and it would be a five star .	1
It might be hard to believe , but this type of wire stand has probably been around for over 35 years . It is simple and easy to use . You just unfold the `` legs '' , and set it up on a suitable surface . When you are done , it folds up into a relatively small space for easy storage or transport . It works pretty well for many hardback books , and some paperbacks as well.The stand is made out of silver colored steel rods , and has two `` legs '' that swivel out from the frame . The legs do n't extend back too far , and the frame is small , but the stand is still fairly stable , and can be used with larger books . On the opposite end of the legs , the rod is bent up 90 degrees , forming a section designed to hold the pages open . This section is a little over an inch high , which is n't a lot . Besides swiveling the `` legs '' , not much adjustment is possible.When opened , hardbacks tend to stay open , while the opposite is true of most paperbacks . That being the case , this stand works pretty well with most hardbacks less than 1.4 '' thick , and some midsized paperbacks . It does n't do so well with smaller pocket sized paperbacks , and large oversized paperbacks.The adhesive backing of paperbacks tends to close the pages when opened , so for paperbacks of a certain size , you may have some difficulty using the stand , unless you do n't mind over bending the spine of your paperback to `` crack '' it open . You can also adjusting the position of the legs , to try and `` lock '' the pages in place , which might possibly crinkle your pages , or make turning pages an adventure . A larger , really stiff paperback , could possibly tip the stand over , as the pages attempt to close.Quality control concerning the legs is another issue . In a clever design , the wire is twisted around to form a series of spirals , which are then inserted onto vertical rods on the frame , forming a `` hinge '' . Sometimes the fit of the hinge is too tight , but a loose fit is more common , and unfortunately legs that swivel too easily can make the stand less stable . Because the legs are usually not exactly the same , the stand probably wo n't be perfectly level . One leg is usually higher , so you might need to adjust the position , or even bend them a bit.This product is very durable . I have a couple of them that are over 20 years old , and while the silver finish has a little corrosion , and some of the legs are loose , but unless a weld fails , the stand should last well past my lifetime.Fellowes apparently likes this design , as after many years , it seems largely unchanged . I feel that they could have made a version with a larger frame , that elevates the book higher , and also has higher posts in the front to hold back the pages better , but what do I know.Besides books , the stand can also be used for any number of flat objects , like sheet music , a magazine , record albums ( remember them ? ) , or even an e-reader like a Kindle or Nook . It might be a bit pricey for what it is , but it 's nearly indestructible , so you probably wo n't be replacing it anytime soon .	1
I see too many negative comments . It 's 5 bucks . How powerful of a book stand do you want for 5 bucks ? No it does n't lock . No it does n't hold 2000 page dictionaries . However ... .Yes , it 's 5 bucks ... .Yes , it holds a college books ... .Yes , it stays still ( even without a lock ! ) . Good stuff for 5 bucks . It holds a book.If you 're thinking this will hold a large book , it wo n't . A large hardcover book , like a certification book , would have to be less than 400 pages to fit in here . The only way it would fit a large dictionary , as pictured , would be if you opened it to the middle page and never wanted to read any place else .	1
I 've gone through quite a few wrist rests lately , basically because my son ( 11 ) likes pulling at them till they fall apart , not a habit I encourage ! I need wrist rests because otherwise I get pain and ca n't use the computer . This one is different in that it is feels like it 's coated with plastic wrap rather than fabric . It 's very comfortable and best of all my son ca n't pick at it as he did with the more fabric covered ones . I have hopes that this will last longer . It 's firmer than other wrist rests I 've used and also a little narrower . Personally I would have liked it to be a little longer and wider , it 's the narrowest wrist rest I 've ever used , but then again , it also uses less desk space and does the job . Let 's see if it lasts the distance.Edited to add , 7 months later it still looks like the first day it did when I took it out , so it 's outlasted the past few ones that I 've bought , I like the firmness and got used to the narrowness . I would still like it to be a little longer but otherwise very happy with it	1
I always have great luck with this product . It cushions my wrists gently , but firmly , so they do n't after a day at the keyboard . I have the matching mouse pad , which is also fantastic for the wrist.I was really surprised that it worked well with the small Mac keyboard . Your hands are in a different position than with PC , but that does n't seem to impact the effectiveness.Great buy for the price .	1
The wrist rest is great , but I wish I had bought one slightly larger ... wider , that is , not longer or higher . It would help a little bit more as a rest .	1
Suits my needs just fine . And I love that this wrist rest absolutely does not slide . I also own a wireless Knicks keyboard which leans against the wrist rest so I do n't have to worry about it shuffling around .	1
This is very comfortable for me when doing heavy typing . Durable , cheap and not bad looking . The gel feels great next to my wrists ... .	1
My wife uses a computer for her job and she finds this very helpful to reduce fatigue of her hand and arm.She likes the size it 's not to small or to big and the price was right .	1
The onscreen color looks much lighter than the actual color . It 's actually more royal blue , or my favorite : `` NY Knicks '' blue . And just like it 's companion ( Fellowes Gel Crystals Wrist Rest , 91137 ) , which I also purchased via Amazon , the mousepad does not slide around . I am very happy with both my mousepad and wrist rest .	1
I got this new mouse pad/wrist rest when I got my new trackball mouse . I had read the reviews and I was impressed by the reviews that said the gel did not compress like the foam types.So far , my expectations have been met . The wrist rest is comfortable and it does not compress like my old foam one did.Being as I use a trackball , I did have one problem . My trackball mouse slid all over the pad when I pressed a button . I would expect that to be good news for people who use the traditional roll around type of mouse.My solution was to buy a set of those round non-slip jar openers for the kitchen . One of them under my mouse completely solved the slipping problem.I like this mouse pad/wrist rest so much that I bought a gel pad wrist rest for my keyboard . They are both great !	1
Ordered for my husband as a birthday present and could n't have picked anything better . He will not use any other wrist rest . His old one had some SERIOUS age on it but still worked GREAT . I just thought it was time for one that looked `` fresher '' and had a fresh mousepad surface . Fellowes mousepad/wrist rests are the best ! ! !	1
This mouse pad looks good , it is a nice blue color and a nice size for a small computer desk . It provides support for my wrist , and I need it because without the support it is uncomfortable to use the mouse for more than a short period of time ( Review written by Bun 's husband )	1
My wrists used to hurt before I got this pad and after a week of using it my wrist does n't hurt as much .	1
I saw a similar products ( at my brother 's ) and appreciated the wrist support . Sae this on Amazon & ordered it . Like it better as it is firmer and gives good support for resting the wrist	1
Just what I needed . I 'm happy with the purchase and the color too .	1
I bought this gel mouse pad to replace my previous Belkin Gel Mouse pad that finally gave out after 10 years of service.My old one lasted 10 years , at which point it got a whole on the wrist-rest and that was the beginning of the end for it . The wrist-rest on this particular mouse pad is high enough that my hand is at a comfortable position . I got the blue one , which is like a pantone blue . Very nice .	1
I started using the mouse pads with the wrist rest a couple of years ago . Since that time I have had no issues with cramping in the wrist area , especially when I spend a lot of time online ( especially with repetitive game moves ) .	1
I own several Belkin products that I 'm very happy with . I already have this mouse pad in silver , but it is going on 10 years old . I recently bought a new computer and decided to treat myself to a new mouse pad . This blue color is a nice royal blue . I am VERY happy with my new mouse pad ! Would definitely buy more Belkin products in the future .	1
I used these magnet sheets to make my own custom fridge poetry . The sheets easily went through my laser printer and everything printed correctly . Cutting the sheets using a paper cutter and scissors was equally easy . Now I have custom fridge poetry.For my goals , this product was perfect .	1
bought this to print pics on . works very well . ink does not smudge easily using an ink jet printer . husband loves it ! definitely recommend it and will buy it	1
I could n't tell you how these print , since I 'm not using them for that purpose ... so please only read on if you 're a Cricut user and interested in using them with your machine.I wanted to make magnetic paper dolls with my Cricut expression and the paper doll dressup cartridge for my daughters . I was n't sure if these would be strong enough given the comments of how thin they are but since we plan to use our dolls on cookie sheets they will be more then perfect . Plus since they are thin instead of the usual recommended settings with the cricut you actually only need to multi cut these 2 times ( I have n't tested yet but I think even once would work as long as you 're using the deep cut blade set to 6 and pressure at 4 or 5 ) .I also used them to just make cute magnets for the fridge with the cricut . Though I 'm not sure they would actually hold up more then a single piece of paper they do stay up well on their own even with 2-3 layers of paper glued to them ( ie I cut the base shape out of the magnetic paper , then the base shape again out of my background color , then they layers and glued them all together ) . Super cute ! They also cut very easily with an exacto knife or scissors . For anyone curious the surface is matte not glossy , so sadly I do n't think they would work at all with the alcohol inks .	1
I used this item to make a sign that requires no additional material to hang . It works perfectly and it allows you to make neat looking signs .	1
I love making refrigerator magnets with these sheets , they 're super easy to use and work very well . They have decently strong magnetic force , and can hold a couple of sheets of paper if the finished magnet size is 3 & # 34 ; x 3 & # 34 ; or larger .	1
These sheets are great and using the required inkjet printer does not smudge once printed . Sticks well to surfaces and holds it shape well .	1
This stand looks really nice and does it 's job well . I have one at work and home and it is great for freeing up some desk space .	1
Measure carefully because I did not . Yes , the outside measurement of the stand is 14-1/2 inches , but my laptop is also 14-1/2 inches , so rather than sitting on the desk below my monitor , it sits on the legs of the stand . This means I need to be very careful with the docking station so it seats in properly . But the stand looks nice and will do for now .	1
This is a basic stand for a monitor . It 's just a curved metal tube with a metal plate affixed to the top . The first one I got was defectively assembled -- the metal plate on top was crooked , badly out of square . I returned it , and the replacement is much better.The color is a sort of metallic black . There is a gray Allsop logo painted on in raised letters on the front right part of the tube.It gets the job done and looks decent enough .	1
For the last few years , I 've been using my Subwoofer as a monitor stand and decided it was time to man-up and buy a monitor stand . I found this one ( and a few of the others ) and decided on the pewter colored stand , and I love it.Do n't expect this monitor stand to push you to the edge of life , or anything , but it 's a good stand . It 's also a nice bonus that I can set my keyboard directly underneath the stand .	1
If you own a laptop and use an external LCD monitor or you are just looking to sneak some small peripherals or desk accessories beneath your monitor or an inkjet printer , look no further . The MetalArt Jr. is a classy alternative to molded plastic stands intended for beafier CRT monitors . I ordered the product to use as a stand for a 17 & quot ; LCD monitor . Not only does it raise the monitor to the ideal height , but it is spaced perfectly to store my IBM T40 laptop and docking station neatly beneath . The perforated metal at the top of the stand allows air to flow freely and keeps both the laptop and monitor cool.The description does n't give the dimensions of the stand , which are very important since its size is not traditional , so I 'll list them here ( from the manufacturer ) : 11 & quot ; x 15 & quot ; x 4.5 & quot ; .	1
The item holds my new 22 inch LCD just fine.It does n't bounce and shake if knocked , so the monitor is nice and safe.We bought three and all three came with cheap , sloppy paint jobs . So to match my all black computer I spray painted them and it looks like I bought it that way.The space under is perfect for my Logitech Wave Keyboard to slid out of the way or a nice place to throw those pads of sticky notes , pens and whatnots.OVERALL : We 've bought one for all three family members and its been great to gain some desk space and ensure we are more ergonomic by having the monitor at the correct hight for the desk/chair setup . Its the cheapest metal unit I could find and it holds up under the weight just fine .	1
We 've used these at work for years . Now that I 've converted to a Windows 8 tablet , I purchased two more ( one for my home office and one for work ) . Now my main monitor sits on a large one , and the tablet sits on the smaller one - enabling me to make use of both screens - and it opens up space below the monitors for other office items .	1
Great little stand . I use for my external hard drives to allow heat to dissipate . I also used for my PS3 to avoid overheating .	1
I bought about 14 of these for 17-23 inch monitors . They hold up nice and also look nice . They have been used for about 7 months now with no problems or complaints by the people using them . I would buy this item again .	1
I bought this stand to support a smaller printer , with storage for paper underneath . The stand is perfectly stable , and the pewter is a neutral dark silver that does look like the Amazon picture.The stand is wide enough to store a ream of paper underneath , as well as smaller stacks of photo paper . Very pleased with the usefulness of this stand .	1
love it	1
I needed more space for `` digital devices '' . I have a laser printer and needed a place to put the office scanner I just purchased . This fits perfectly on top of the printer without making the printer unusable . The paper comes out of the printer and the scanner sits right on top of this awesome device.The stand is metal and very sturdy . It can easily hold an old CRT monitor ... though , who even has one nowadays ? It is marketed as a monitor stand , but you can ( obviously ) use it wherever you want and put whatever you want on it .	1
My new stand arrived 100 % assembled . I figured I would need to put it together ... .not the case.The color matches the picture and the finish is even and well applied.I got this to place my 23 inch Dell multi movement ultra sharp monitor . It seems well made and I expect years of use .	1
I bought the stand to raise up my little HP Printer ( a great little printer , by the way ) and the stand does a great job of it at a low price and is more than strong enough for something heavier , like a flat screen monitor .	1
Does the job perfectly as described - holds the tv above the dvr box and is attractive on the tv stand !	1
I got this as a stand for my PS2 Slim . I was worried about generated heat and this metal stand makes a great heat sink . It 's even got holes in it that add even more ventilation . I now have room to store my controllers under the system so as a space saver alone it was worth the nominal price . This is the cheapest monitor stand of reasonable quality I have found.It would also make a very nice stand with passive cooling for your laptop , if you were typing on a coffee table that 's lower than the couch you 're sitting on . Set on a normal desk , its height would be a bit cumbersome to type on , unless you hooked up an external keyboard.Be clear , this *will not* support much weight . The whole missing front support is a design is flaw in my opinion . However , if you 're using it for something light it 's great . The color is n't as nice looking as the picture would lead you to believe , but I really do n't care .	1
Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes , and I 'm very happy with them . The paper works flawlessly with my printer ( Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer ) , and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing . The cards can be printed on front and back , which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them , or else you 'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer , at least , is n't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll	1
My wife needed some cards for recipes and we ordered these since there was a discount on the box . The cards are good quality card stock and we can print three recipe cards per page.With a little work on the computer you can add just about anything you want on the cards and the bakers and cookers will thank you time and time again . By adding some color you can make those plain white cards into a very nice recipe card .	1
I 've been a user of 3 x 5 cards for decades . There 's always a stack of them in my shirt pocket , though I do admit to not using them consistently.Right now , I 'm working on a project that requires me to catalog dozens of snippets from various sources and then integrate them into my writing . Typical outlining programs wo n't handle this well , so it 's back to the index cards . Fortunately , one of my outlining programs handles output to the Avery cards.You can also use them with Microsoft Word , FileMaker , Access and any other program that lets you format your print output.These things tear neatly and accept laser or inkjet output.Brutally expensive when compared to ordinary index cards , but incomparably handy . Worth the price when you need a foolproof method of printing index cards . The regular ones often do n't get along with some - actually many - printers.Jerry	1
This product is very good and has a variety of uses . I use it for making small labels and other types of information cards . They can be easily laminated and used over and over again .	1
I needed to print index cards to keep membership records for a club ( of 120 members ) and I went to a well-known chain office supply store to pick up a package , which probably would have bee available for the standard cost of $ 24.50 . Of all the AVERY products on the shelves of this story , would n't you know - the only item they do not carry is this one . The sales clerk offered to order a package for me but I said NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH - I WILL ORDER MY OWN FROM AMAZON , which I did and saved myself about ten bucks in the process . With the Prime free shipping , I received them in no time , and they are all printed and ready for the membership chairperson to do her thing.The printing went very smoothly . I used the avery label preset for the item number and created a 4-page document for printing , 3 labels per page , and made each page a different color - to conserve my ink supply of any particular color , as well as to keep working with the cards from being boring . I rear loaded my printer ( though the cards would probably have fed through the bed just as well but why take chances ) and they went through like a charm , no snags . Breaking off the edges and separating the cards was literally a snap . WILL order again .	1
Its a good mouse pad . Decent quality . Excellent if your on a budget .	1
It is easy to use and the mouse glides but does n't slip around . It has been great also to protect my table .	1
I like this Pad it works well for my wireless mouse since I scared up my Desk and it did n't work so well on that ant more . So covers the defect and looks nice too . Stays in place well had one that move around alot so this is a plus .	1
I 've worn out the mouse favorable coating on the the shelfe . The new pad is great and my new mouse responds really fast as I use it . My wife favors it because , & # 34 ; it 's coloered to match & # 34 ; everything else , black . The old mouse mouse was white . The rubber base keeps the pad from moving around and has improved my game playing .	1
You just ca n't beat this mousepad for the $ 2 price . Surface works with all varieties of mice - optical , regular , etc ... Nice surface texture and thickness . Rubber backing grips desktop surface firmly .	1
You would thing that all mouse pads are the same , but this is not true . While it does not have a fancy design , just plain old black , it stays where I put it and my mighty mouse just works great . It does not collect litter as some cloth bases pads do , the graphics ( since there are none ) do not wear off . Great .	1
TheBelkin F8E089-BLK 8-by-9-Inch Mouse Pad ( Black ) is the first mouse pad I have purchased in a decade or so , and it is the only one I have ever had that actually worked well with optical mice . Occasionally , it will not track correctly , and I have to give the mouse an extra nudge , but so far this has been a rare occurrence . The only problem I have had was that the mouse pad reeked of chemicals ( the rubber bottom ? ) when I removed it from the box , but that has almost entirely dissipated . If I put my nose next to it I can still detect the smell , though . Someone with a sensitive nose might be bothered .	1
I 've used another similar one for years and this one , hopefully , will last as long . The glide is smooth , it resists grit and dust more than other pads I 've had and it 's cushy comfortable to use .	1
simple and holds well to the desk..I prefer solid colors so this suits me . Seems odd to do a write up but I have used pads that moved around the desktop , or didnt do well with a mouse . This one does everything its supposed to .	1
I must say that it is a good size . Once I put it in the cage it lays flat and it looks like about 32 mice can sleep on it at one time . They all get a good night 's rest with this mouse pad and all wake up cheery and happy and full of beans and ready for a good day 's work on the old exercise wheel or tearing through the maze like gangbusters .	1
This is exactly what you 'd expect , and it 's a good thickness ( better than some of the more thin and flimsy ones ) . For our darker wood desks , the black color does better at appearing less evident than the other , lighter colors .	1
At the price that 's offered , it 's no wonder that thisBelkin 8-by-9-Inch Mouse Pad ( Black ) is the # 1 in sales for mouse pads . It 's simple , basic black and the perfect 9.2 x 8.3 inches that have almost become an industry standard . There are no duckies , Hawaiian tropical flowers , basset hounds , sports team logos , photos of Sports IllustratedSports Illustrated swimsuit models , hot air balloons , comic book characters , or images of mountains that you 'll probably never visit . It 's just a basic black mouse pad ; nothing more , nothing less.But ... oh , the smell ! Maybe that 's an added feature , a freebie that was n't noted in the product specs ? Actually , there 's a fast and easy solution to remove that somewhat noxious odor , but bear with me so that you 'll understand the logic . Some of the first mouse pads were actually made from manufacturer 's scrap of the same neoprene foam backed with a thin sheet of nylon or Spandex that we find in Scuba and free-divewetsuits , and some of us made out own mouse pads from worn out or badly torn wetsuits.So what does this have to do with smelly mouse pads ? That 's easy : those old wetsuits stunk when new , but one hoped the atrocious smell would go away by the second or third dive . However , they smelled like a cross between a wet dog and dead opossum road kill when left in a plastic bag in the trunk of a car for a few days after a dive , so they had to be washed ... and quickly . Today we have products such as Sink The Stink Wetsuit Wash and others to deal with getting rid of the stench . But these cost more than the mouse pad itself , which is ridiculous.The solution is simple : wash the mousepad thoroughly with your standard kitchen dishwashing soap . Good old green Palmolive works fine . Rinse it and gently wring out the excess water , then wash it again the same way ( think of it like shampooing your hair ) . Set it on a flat surface between layers of paper towels to blot up the excess water . Depending on your climate , it should be dry and ready to use within a day or two . I 'm not going to suggest that you try this , but there are some of us who take our mouse pads and put them in the washing machine with older dark clothes . Just remember to not put them in a clothes dryer.OK , back to the mouse pad.It 's good , it 's priced right , it 's functional , it will work with just about any mouse , be it optical or the older one with mouse balls . Wash it and get rid of that smell that makes one think you pulled it out of a garbage dump or an old tire recycling plant and it will last a long time.9/5/2012	1
For the price this mouse pad is , it works great . Firm grip on the bottom and smooth on the top . The right size for a mousepad and I really like it .	1
It is a mousepad and it is cheap . Pretty self explanatory . I do not have an issue with its durability or anything . It is a good buy for the price but likely not up to par for people who are doing intense gaming . Just a standard size and standard material used for most mousepads .	1
What can you say about a mouse pad . It 's rubber , it grips the surface , and you use it for you mouse . This one is thick and substantial ... ... ... and we 're pleased with it .	1
Yep - it stinks . Smells like old rubber and stinky cigars . I was surprised at how noxious the smell was . I 've own/used plenty of mouse pads over the years and never noticed any type of nasty smell to them . They generally do n't smell at all . I ended up putting this one in the cold garage for a few days and now the smell is n't as noticeable . If it really bothers you , you could try putting it in a bag with a dryer sheet . Otherwise , it 's a mouse pad and works like a mouse pad should . Just do n't understand why it smells so bad .	1
This is a standard mouse pad . It smelled strongly of rubber when it arrived , so I left it outside on the clothesline for a couple of weeks before I brought it in . It 's well made and does the job just fine .	1
Good product , it was cheap but at the same time it did pretty well its job . Recommend for your mouse .	1
I had a similar style ( fabric-over-rubber ) mouse pad since the 90s that I got from a store as a `` gift with purchase '' . It worked with both ball and optical mice , but it started to peel from age . My old employer had some promotional pads made from vinyl and I could n't believe how much build-up generated on the bottom of the mice.Found these here at Amazon and ordered 3 - this is exactly what I wanted ... a durable fabric-over-rubber mouse pad , perfect size for the desk , inexpensive , and functional . No markings or logos on it , just plain black . Could n't ask for better .	1
Bought 2 of these to replace one that I beat up a lot . For the price these pads are soft , large and really good .	1
Top quality at a very competive price . Works wonderfully and is one of the best pads I have ever used - looks like it is made to last . Highly recommended . Russ Pendred , Ocean Isle Beach , NC	1
Simple and cheap mouse pad I had a glass desk and was using a book as a mouse pad but this mouse pad works way better . I have spilled a lot of water and other liquids and was thankful it does n't hold water . Its still in tip top condition and is still holding up great .	1
Newer optical laser mouse has trouble tracking on uneven or glossy surfaces . This mouse pad is thick and soft and fills the contours where a mouse will have trouble tracking . Nice quality at a cheap price . Similar fancy pads at Best Buy are over $ 10 .	1
A lot of people ( myself included ) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition . However , what you do n't hear enough of is praise for their performance . So , I 'll just say it : Avery labels perform better than the compettion . They adhere better , they 're thicker , they block out what is underneath better , and they do n't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer . Quite simply , for laser or injet labels , Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance . You get what you pay for .	1
I use these as labels for bottles . It is the perfect size for labeling 12.7 ounce bottles . The positive points are:1 - They do not jam , bend or otherwise get messed up during the printing cycle.2 - They peel easily from the sheet , but stick VERY firmly to glass.3 - They are thick enough so that they can be applied to bottles smoothly with no wrinkles . This is a HUGE advantage over some other types of labels we have tried.4 - The 5264 template is built in to most major software packages . Setting up the labels for printing was a breeze.The negatives are : Have n't found any yet ! One reviewer mentioned that he had problems removing labels once they were applied to bottles . First , that 's generally a good thing . The last thing I would want to happen is to have the labels just slide off after getting wet or being subjected to temperature changes . However I tried removing labels for the first time last week and did n't really find it all that hard . What I did was rinse the bottles with hot running water for a couple of minutes . I then places the bottles in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes . The labels peeled right off for the most part . In a couple of cases there was a bit of adhesive left on bottles , but that rubbed off easily enough while the bottle was still hot.My wife actually then used a bit of an environmentally friendly degreaser on a bottle that was not boiled , and that seemed to remove the adhesive easily enough as well.I highly recommend this product .	1
it is expensive , cost about 50 % -100 % more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good . Printing has not jammed so far . Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages . Also fall from plastic bags after a few days ( I might be not comparing apples to apples , as the previous labels has a smaller size . I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers , no difference .	1
They have done excellent job of shipping . It came right even before they said and we are on two opposite coasts in USA . Good job of packing and shipping . My only complain is they said when I looked last time that I bought the last of this label . If they continue the way they have done for me . They will have my business . See price is everything . I have been using these labels for years so I do know if they are good or not . I know they are . I know they come in two forms one is high gloss other is not . Not sure which one I got it is not at home .	1
Your product is the same as the local stores but at an affordable price.Keep it up guys.Thanks to you we can afford to buy good brand name labels instead of chain store knock offs .	1
Fast shipping ... great price ... best of the best ... I tried the cheaper labels and they were a complete disappointment.The Avery labels are just the best ... I 'll never use any other brand again.Ol ' Dave said that	1
We only buy Fellowes shredders and have found them very reliable . I originally purchased the oil for the cutters directly from Fellowes a couple of years ago ; the bottle was smaller and more expensive at the time . I was quite pleased to find this product available from Amazon at a good price and larger bottle.I think a lot of people buy a shredder , not knowing that it does need some maintenance to keep it in top shape . Besides not overloading your shredder 's capabilities or shredding material that you should n't , the next best thing you can do to protect your investment is to regularly lubricate the cutters . This reduces wear , noise , and can prevent the teeth from breaking.Be sure to read the instructions for your particular shredder , however , about the type of oil to use and the frequency . You may be tempted to use other types of oil you already have around your house or WD-40 or something , but many of those things are flammable and will only serve to damage your shredder or worse.As another reviewer said , be careful when cutting the tip on the bottle because if you make it too big , the oil will be harder to control .	1
I am on my second shredder . I did not use shredder oil on the first one , and after about 1 year use it froze . I was not able to get it going again . When I bought a replacement shredder I began applying shredder oil every month and I can really tell the difference . The shredder is three years old now and operates as well as new . The motor sounds even it chews through the papers very well.The bottle is easy to open and a long extension nozzle is helpful for precise place-ment of the drops . Each application requires only a small amount of oil . I would say I put a total of 8 drops in the opening , and then move the blades in both directions . This takes a total of many 20 seconds.I read that once this oil runs out it can be replaced by vegetable oil and I will try that , however this is not going to happen any time soon as I use very little during each application , so this bottle is going to last a very long time.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates . There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon , this tool is called `` Online Price Alert '' . This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify . If you search on `` online price alert '' in Google it will be come up at the top . I find this tool to be very helpful .	1
Love the reviews ... . just opened this and ran a few pages through the shredder and nicehad another brand of the same stuff before I moved and would not have bought this except my daughter moved me and did not bring it ... expect with the use this shredder gets this bottle may last as long as I do~ ( I 'm 70 )	1
After my shredder started to make slow progress taking papers to be destroyed , I ordered this oil to fix the problem . It has exceeded my expectations many times over .	1
Now that I 've finally learned to read and follow directions , I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly . Every time I empty the waste bucket , I spray a bit of this lube on the cutters , and run them forward and reverse . So far , my latest shredder is running smooth as silk , with this simple bit of prevent . maintenance.The oil itself seems very good , no smell or spatter when I 'm lubing the cutters . And a little bit goes a long way .	1
First shredder we had we used spray that came with it , we used it once a month and the shredder last 6 months . It started making a weird sound in the first three months so this time we went with regular liquid oil this time . We had two deaths in the family so lots to shred ( a years worth under normal use ) and this is either a better machine or this type of oil works better , I 'm guessing it 's the oil .	1
I use it after every bag of shredded paper . It can be a little messy because the applicator nozzle creates large drops that are hard to get in the slot unless you have very good aim . Lubrication of the confetti cutters is definitely needed to maintain the shredder and get maximum life . The bottle will probably outlast the shredder . We 'll see .	1
My wife and I shred just about everything , but you only need a few drops each time you change the bag . If I am still alive when this bottle is empty , then I will consider myself lucky . Maybe we can put it in the will for our grandchildren someday .	1
This is a great product that will help keep your paper shredder gunk free and working great for a long time . Just follow the instructions on the bottle . A little goes a long way . I would recommend this product to anyone that is concerned about keeping their paper shredder working at its best .	1
We do a lot of shredding as part of our non-profit business , and want to keep our Fellowes shredder running for a long time . This oil is great , and comes in a size large enough to last for a long time . The long nozzle make the application of the oil simple . Good product , good company ...	1
If you get a decent shredder , like we did , it is also worth the money to get lubricant for it . This is a good oil , but I ca n't help but think I could have just used canola oil from the kitchen , as this product is labeled vegetable oil .	1
I use this to lubricate the blades on my Fellows shredder . It is excellent . Highly Recommend . All Fellows items seem to be high-quality .	1
There is a lot of debate on whether you should just buy cheap canola oil for your shredder or more expensive shredder oil . I 'm sure both work fine , but is the $ 5-6 price tag on this really worth taking the chance ? For a moderate home user , 12oz of Shredder Oil will last probably longer than your shredder ( maybe two shredders ) . I for one think that this is a small price to pay to protect my $ 250+ Fellowes Micro Cut Shredder . As far as the product goes , it works great . I have had my shredder for a couple of years with moderate use and there has been no build-up of oil or slow downs in its function . It is still working as well and as quiet as it did on the first day . I use the oil every bag change or if I have n't used it in a few weeks . Great product at a reasonable price .	1
This oil comes in a plastic container with a nozzle that makes it easy to lubricate the shredder . Yes , it is outrageously priced but it does the job it supposed to do . I just do n't believe a product should be given a poor rating because of the price . I do believe that price is a factor in the purchase decision but not in the product itself . But , that 's just my opinion . When I run out of the Fellowes lubricant I will refill the container with vegetable oil because of the price but not because of the quality of the Fellowes oil .	1
This should be a standard item supplied with any shredder . it lubricates the knife pivots and will extend the life of your shredder considerably if used every time the shredder is emptied .	1
Very good product . Ever since using it , the shredder definitely sounds to be working smoother and definitely more quietly as it shreds .	1
We 've used this for two years with our shredder , and the machine still shreds just fine , so I guess it works as advertised . The only drawback is that it is a little messier than the lubricated sheets used for the same purpose.Other than the cleanliness of the sheets ( 1.33/sheet , a new one to be used every time the basket is emptied ) , I don ' ; t think they 're as cost effective as the oil . It 's cheap , it'as easy and it stares at me from my shelf so I wo n't forget to use it .	1
I am glad I followed the manual on my Fellowes Shredder . Keeping the shredder oiled properly really helps it running for the long haul .	1
This product is great and works as advertised . It 's a small price to pay to extend the life of my shredder . Buy it , use it , and keep that shredder working at peak .	1
It does n't really matter what make of shredder you have ... after a while , you have to oil it to keep the blades happy . Well , this oil is made just for that purpose and it does a great job ... highly recommended ( and needed if you have a shredder ) ...	1
We 've been using those oil-filled sheets that you run through the shredder every so often to lube it up . I found this , at a much , much lower cost , and figured I 'd give it a shot , expecting a small bottle of oil similar to ones I 've seen at the store . Nope . This is a full-size , 12 oz bottle , which is a LOT of shredder oil , at least for our home use . I figure it will last at least a year , and likely 2-3.Careful cutting off the tip - it 's just like a tube of caulk , and if you cut off too much , you 'll have a hard time controlling it . Other than that , it 's easy to apply , with a nice long nozzle , flows easily , and works great .	1
Fellowes Powershred Shredder Oil & Lubricant works like a charm . It lubricates the paper shredder so well , it decrease the noise of shredding paper in half.I burnt through two shredders in two years , before I started using this lubricant . My machine is now working fine , and I 'm sure with regular use of the lubricant , I will get more than one year 's use from my new paper shredder. [ ... ]	1
Fellowes recommends this for the paper-shredder I purchased . It does the job all the way . They suggest an application after every discarded load of shredded paper ; this keeps your machine quiet and running well .	1
The oil is needed to keep your shredder working properly . Trust me , I messed one up by not oiling it.This bottle will last a lifetime .	1
Breathed new life into my shredder ... ... ... ... . Mine was getting stuck and binding up . Constantly had to pick out the paper that got stuck in the teeth , or `` back it out '' and re-try . Put a pin hole in the tip ( took someones advise and did n't cut the tip off ) and drizzled it along the teeth . Ran several sheets through and my cross cut micro shredder has come back to life . I had no idea shredders needed this kind of maintenance.I 'll be adding lube to the teeth every couple of months , and the bottle I got was huge . Will last me the rest of this shredders life . Got the product very fast too , thanks to my Prime Membership	1
Keeps my Royal 10 Sheet shredder in good working order ! Used other Brands in the past , just not as good .	1
The bottles open easily . The oil goes where you point it . The shredder seems to like it as it 's still going strong .	1
Well it 's oil , I 'm sure how one can rate this . Well I can say it is in a nice bottle .	1
I only have a super cheap-o shredder from wal mart of something . I got this oil because I read that it really helps shredders work longer . Regular lubricating oils technically help with the lubrication , but the paper dust gets stuck to regular oils and clog up the machine , creating a different problem . Shredder oil is supposedly specially created so that this wo n't happen . So I figured it was worth a shot . I 've now had my crappy shredder for years . I will eventually get a nicer one and there is so much oil in the bottle I wo n't have to get more . But I think my shredder would have died long ago if it was n't for this lubricating oil made for shredders .	1
I bought this for maintenance on my shredder , I use this every time bag is full on my shredder.keeps dust down and waste basket cleaner & only $ 5 bottle should last a long time.Tip is short still able to reach blades but I put a small flexible straw on tip witch gives me better control of oil application .	1
I thought my shredder was about to die , but I purchased this product and oiled it up . The grinding sound is gone , and the shredder is working much better overall . I 'm talking about a shredder that is over 8 years old here !	1
It is as claimed . A light odorless lubricant that improves the cutting of the shredder blades . After shredding about ten bags of paper I used this lubricant and immediately noticed a difference in the sound of the shredder motor and there was no & # 34 ; oil & # 34 ; smell . A hint that I learned is to put the shredder in reverse and then apply the lubricant and let it run for about 10 SECONDS . When you puncture the spout be sure to use a small pin . If you cut the tip off you will use too much .	1
This is a big bottle of light weight oil for a paper shredder . I use it just to keep the blades movingsmoothly and it does work . There 's a definite increase in speed when the oil goes it .	1
This stuff came as a surprise to me thru an order of a new Fellows shredder . I ordered the new machine because my last shredder was gasping it 's death rattle . In researching the new Fellows machine , I began to see comments about the need to lubricate these things and so when I ordered the Fellows , I also ordered the lubricant . After receiving it , I had a brainstorm that maybe if I tried it on the old dying rattletrap shredder , it might do it some good . Wow ! This stuff brought the old machine back to life . I have had several shredders die prematurely over the years and never had an inkling that they might need some simple lubricant.If you have a shredder , any shredder , buy this stuff and try it out . Ca n't hurt , can it ?	1
Very lightweight oil . Will not gum up the mechanism . It has a very narrow spout for easy application .	1
This shredder oil comes in a large bottle that 's easy to use and sturdy enough not avoid leaking . I use it once or twice a month to keep my Fellows shredder running well . Works great , inexpensive protection for my shredder .	1
Oil has a nice bottle that is compact enough to fit in office smaller areas . Easy to use-just take off red cap-flip over & oil comes out with ease . No messes . I 've had this for awhile & still have a ton of it left . I do average paper shredding .	1
Initially thought that the oil was & # 34 ; watery & # 34 ; when squirted into the shredder via the extension nozzle , and that it would n't do much ... but after one oiling , the shredder seemed to work allot better . Would recommend this over using vegetable oil as that may gum up a shredder .	1
Used bottles of this before . Will keep the blades of the shredder well lubed and sharp . Makes it much easier on the shredder motor .	1
I 've now owned two shredders . The first one , I decided did n't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise . What do I care if the blades are oily ? They just spin and cut , right ? I never have to oil my scissors ... ... wrong . After a while ( albeit a few years ) , the shredder blades simply stopped working . Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil . I 'm following the manual with this one and you should too . Different oils are meant for different purposes , so get one that 's meant for a metal shredder . This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long , long , time .	1
Shredders need lubrication ! I found out the hard way when our Fellows shredder started acting up ( not running items through , stopping , reversing , et cetera ) . I always thought it was a bit of bunk , needing to lubricate shredders , but it 's true , they do need it.When you think about it , paper is drying . It absorbs oil , water , etc , so when you run it through the shredder , it 's going to eventually suck up any lubrication on the cutting wheels.You can use vegetable oils , but that is so messy . This product comes in a large bottle ( suitable for an office environment ) with a spout that can be cut so that just the right amount comes out . And it works great , just running a small bead on the wheels.The shredder , which was balky before , now works as God and Fellows intended . Fellows makes a superior shredder , and their oil keeps the machine in good shape.This is a keeper and is highly recommended ! Shredders are a must these days , and good ones are expensive . It 's worth a little bit of money to keep it going great .	1
Until I purchased my Fellowes shredder a couple of years ago , I did n't even know that you needed to oil them . It came with a small bottle of oil that actually lasted me quite a while . But , when I was ready , I ordered this large bottle of oil and keep it in the compartment on the back of my shredder , so that it is always right there for when it is time to empty the basket and oil again.As I mentioned , this is a LOT of oil and will last a very , very long time for home use and quite a while for office use as well . It comes in a nice , sturdy bottle with a little stopper top that stays on perfectly fine as long as you are n't tossing the bottle around . I like the shape of the bottle because it fits perfectly in the compartment on the back of my shredder . If I was n't able to keep it right there with my shredder I would probably forget to use it.I purchased this eleven months ago and my bottle is still almost full . For six-seven dollars , it is a good deal IMO . Maybe you could just buy a bottle of some other kind of oil , but I think it is worth those few dollars to have a bottle with the thin tip for easy application and I do n't have to remember to run to the kitchen to get some oil , pour it into something that makes it easier to apply , and then have another dish to wash . Sometimes convenience pays for itself .	1
It works great , just as promised . Made a huge difference in the operation of my shredder . ~ $ 6 is kind of pricey for a small bottle of oil , but you really do n't need much at all , you can completely soak a piece of paper with very little , and it 's more than enough to clean it out . I 'm guessing 1 bottle of this stuff will last years .	1
I never knew that shredders needed oil . I went through two before the third one I bought recommended oiling . That shredder was a Fellows . I bought the oil and use it regularly .	1
I would n't say it is a stupid mistake , to think you cut off the tip of the dispenser as ever other product that is designed this way is designed to be cut off , but DO NOT CUT OFF THE TIP . You should punch a hole in the end of it with a needle . I found this out the hard way , but I suppose they saved money on packaging by designing it this way.Overall it is a great product , my shredder is already performing better now that it is lubed up . As this is just a home shredder I feel this size of a bottle will last for years and will also extend the life of my shredder . Would probably give it 4.5 stars just as a light knock for the bottle design , but as long as you know not to cut it you will have no problems .	1
Amazon 's price of $ 5.99 is excellent ! I purchased a much smaller bottle ( less than half the size of this one ) for $ 6 and change from my local Home Depot . I lubricate after every 50 sheets or so and the shredder keeps powering through the piles of paperwork without jamming or overheating .	1
The Fellowes Shredder Oil is a must have if your going to keep your shredder working perfectly . The price is awesome and I would highly recommend purchasing .	1
I bought this together with my Fellowes shredder , and it has kept my shredder working in perfect condition . No complaints so far !	1
It 's ugly . It 's noisy , but it does the job that it 's supposed to do which is elevate my feet . I looked at so many other brands and styles and for the money , this was the best bargain . The movement is not fluid because it 's plastic on plastic , but like I said , it does the job .	1
Although I do n't use one of these myself , I recently purchased three for individuals in our office - and the report is : They love it . When the included rubber feet are applied the unit does not slide around and is at a comfortable angle . It 's not really adjustable , but for the price there is no beating it .	1
This is a good quality foot rest . It is made of sturdy material and sits firmly in place without moving on the wooden floor where I use it . I would imagine it would do the same on a standard , plasticchair mat . I does exactly what I need , lift my feet to take pressure off my low back.Highly recommended .	1
This foot rest fits nicely under my desk at work and is a welcome relief for staying comfortable while sitting at my desk all day . A particularly nice feature is that it is adjustable so that I can change my position if needed . For the price I think this product is well worth it .	1
This is not of the same quality as the Kensington foot rest . I now have both it and this one.It is a smaller version and does not have the same range of motion and comfortable gel foot pads.BUT , it is far cheaper.So in balancing the function versus the price it is a very acceptable solution to leg pain when working for prolonged periods at a computer desk.I was needing another foot rest at my L shaped computer desk but did not want to pay the high price of the Kensington model.When balancing the cost and usability of this foot rest I am pleased with my purchase . It provides most of the same qualities of the more expensive options . It is worth the price asked and I find it to be restful .	1
I could n't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up ! The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright . Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder , I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure . The only thing that I 'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs do n't seem to separate that far , but I 've pushed it and written on it and it 's sturdy enough and wo n't tip over that easily . I love how it 's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides , or white board on one side and flip chart on the other . Very versatile .	1
We have been using this particular DryErase/Flip Chart outside of our store for 2 years now . We do not use it as an `` Easel , '' but rather as a hanging board ( where it hangs downward ) to promote specials and products.After purchasing another product that did n't work , we were especially grateful to purchase this particular one . It is sturdy , and except in high winds , we do not have a problem with it blowing over . Best of all , we can write on both sides - either turning it sideways so it can be seen by cars / Pedestrians coming from either direction , or facing front , with the ability to turn it later in the day to promote a different sale ( especially helpful for Thanksgiving day sales ) .As a small business owner , I appreciate the flexibility of being able to promote items without a lot of hassle , and this particular chart has been especially helpful to us .	1
The Quarter Easel Whiteboard and Flipchart is perfect for Sunday School at my church . I like the double sided writing surface and angled feature for good viewing across the classroom . I just wish I could get one for every classroom . The board is very sturdy and well built . It does take two people to set it up and secure the legs . The double-sided white board makes it a reversible writing space . It also will hold the Easel Pads 27 x 34 Inch . I highly recommend this easel whiteboard for a small office or classroom use .	1
Whenever I have a study group at my house , it drives me bonkers to have to demonstrate everything on a piece of paper . This easel style whiteboard is stupid easy to set up . It comes assembled already . All you do is adjust the height to where you want it , and tighten the knobs so it stays put . Then , it stays exactly where you put it until you 're ready to adjust it again . You can write on both sides . Both top and bottom have the little marker holding tray on it . The legs spread out so that the easel stays nice and stable on the ground . This makes life so much easier to study , because everything is right there .	1
Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable . I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office ( and used it at our garage sale ! ) . It wipes off very easy ( often I just use a paper towel ) . I love that it turns into a table ( we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books ! ) . I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations ( or even in a cafe as a & # 34 ; special & # 34 ; of the day board ) .Love it !	1
EXCELLENT quality ... u can buy cheaper ones ... surprisingly stable , folds nicely , I love how its so versatile , becomes a table , or a writing surface ... well designed , well executed ... the reviews on this product were very true to its performance ...	1
This is my new best friend . This thing is awesome.The Quartet Ultima easel is adjustable . I can adjust it to whatever setting I need . It even can be used as a table top but I do n't use it that way . It is easy to move . We have dragged this all over the house and out to the barn to list the days work or anything else . It is so stable , we used it on a float in a parade . It wipes of easily . And the frame seems like it is going to last.I am very pleased	1
Yes , you read correctly , this CAN be converted to an actual TABLE ! This helps if you need a place to put your projector in a pinch.Very easy to adjust , and very sturdy.This piece is a tad bit & # 34 ; bulky & # 34 ; for me ( I am 5'5 & # 34 ; tall , and its size competes with my size ) , but not overly & # 34 ; heavy & # 34 ; as far as weight.Quality is great , and I highly recommend it for presentations , or even just a good writing board for your office .	1
This thing is pretty cool ! It 's bigger than I expected , and blocks out nearly all the light from the window behind it . I 've been needing something like this for a long time though , so light or no light I find it very useful . I teach classical guitar and often need to draw out chords , music or whatever for my students and this is plenty big enough for me to not only draw out the Treble Clef , but the Bass Clef underneath and show how the the two clefs are related . This is a big deal to me because before I was trying to use staff paper and it was n't designed for that purpose , or use a very small white board that would n't hold nearly enough information.I have the tray already loaded with various expo markers and a couple of erasers . The easel is steadier than I expected , and being tall , I can slide it upwards and tighten down the two knobs on each side and it seems to hold alright . The paper catch at the top is a nice touch though I have to work a bit to get any papers to catch in it . I doubt I 'll be using that function much , if any . And I 'll only be using one side of it , but it 's a white board on both sides if you need that.So overall , it 's really good . I 'm hesitant to give it 5 stars yet because it 's kind of pricey , and I do n't know yet how well it will stand ( pun intended ) the test of time . Just noticed it is not magnetized .	1
I am a corporate trainer who has done a lot of volunteer teaching at church . I 've used a lot of this type of product . There are other styles that are more stable by definition . But , of the ones that I have used that are this style , this one seems very stable . You need to learn the rhythm of how to set it up by yourself and it 's much easier with more than one set of hands . But , that 's true of the design , not this specific product . I can do it by myself when the need arises.If you are going to buy one that is this style , this is a good option .	1
This arrived just in time for me to take to a therapy group I was doing a presentation at . I was amazed how light it was compared to other wooden or metal easels I 've used previously . It was relatively easy for me to fold and unfold and carry and set up . Put your foot on the bottom frame , loosen the tightening knobs , and pull up on both sides of the white board at the same time . Tada ! Then tighten into place . Remarkably sturdy ! I paid $ 120 with overnight Prime shipping from Amazon , whereas the identical item was $ 181 before tax at OfficeMax . I 've only had it a few days , but delighted with it .	1
When I first received this easel/table whiteboard from Quartet , I was stunned by the size of the external , and internal , boxes it came packaged in . There 's no shortage of protection used to get this to you safely ! Once it 's unpacked , as I found the case to be with another whiteboard I recently got from Quartet ( theQuartet Matrix Magnetic Modular Whiteboards , 34 Inches x 23 Inches , Silver Aluminum Frame ( M3423 ) , it 's clear that this is a well-made whiteboard.In order to set it up , it IS quite cumbersome to do solo , so try to enlist the assistance of someone else to help you position the whiteboard exactly as you need to . Quartet has made it so you can angle this whiteboard to many different positions , including setting it up as an actual table ( something that I admittedly find to be really daggone cool ) ! The legs on it are sturdy , and do have a grip on the end of each one to ensure that it stays in place once set up . And the fact that it folds down to about a 4 '' thickness when you 're done with it makes it that much easier to stash it away into a narrow space.For anyone not in need of a permanently mounted whiteboard , that wants something that offers more options for setup and mobility , I ca n't imagine this board would leave you wanting . Well-designed , smart , worth the price for the features you get ! And , oh yeah , it 's reversible , too ! You just ca n't beat that ! ; )	1
Aside from one moderate issue , this freestanding dry erase board is great . The only problem with it is that it can be a bit hard to set up without assistance . The knobs that tighten down both the legs and lock the board at the desired angle are hard to turn while also holding everything where you want it . This is solved by laying the board flat on the ground , or by enlisting someone to assist you . Once set up , the board is perfect : stable , easy to write on , made very well , and light . We use three of them at my work place and all are excellent . This board will fit in the trunk of most cars , so it 's great for presentations.4/5 . A solid buy even with the somewhat difficult setup .	1
The Quartet Easel Whiteboard would be a good choice for home offices , homeschoolers , and regular offices.The Whiteboard arrives more or less as one piece . We had to put the endcaps on the pen tray . I do n't know whether they came off during shipping or whether the product ships like that , but it was n't taxing in any sense . Our Whiteboard , by the way , came in it 's own box , which was inside of another Amazon box which means that the UPS guy would have had to go out of his way to damage it.The whiteboard/easel is in contracted-mode when it arrives . Do n't be like me . All you need to do is pull the whiteboard straight up . For some reason I was thinking it would swing out and lock . Not the case . Just make sure the knobs on the side are not tight , have someone hold the base , and then pull the whiteboard straight up . Tighten knobs . I found that none of us could do this alone . It takes two people.Right now my kids are giving this board a workout . They 've used it vertically and they 've used it as a table . It worked as a table , but I would n't buy this product if that 's the main way you plan on using it.Vertically it 's been great . My two older kids have been using it and there 's been no problem with stability . This might not be the case with little children however , as I know they tend to lean on things and hang on them . I 'd advise to keep this product for older kids . Mine are tween and teen.The other use I 've put it through is to clip on a large easel paper . We 've had no problems . The heavy pad stays put during writing.SUMMARYThe biggest shortfall of this whiteboard/easel is that it takes two people to set it up . But after that it can be moved around , no problem.We 've used it as a support for one of those large easel pads with no problem . Also used it as a whiteboard and as a whiteboard table . It 's never fallen over.The one other thing you might want to know is that it is tall enough for a small audience . So you could use this in a small office/classroom setting and two or three rows of people , possibly more , would be able to see what you were doing.Recommend .	1
Excellent price , good product , easy care . Works well in the office and stands up to the wear and tear it gets .	1
They work in my laminater . Do n't know what else to say about them .	1
This design is closed at the short end which makes a much better seal since laminaters recommend that you put the short end through first . Watch for this . There are some where the sealed side is on the long edge and they may bubble.This is also the perfect thickness to use with Teslin . The result is as thick and strong as a credit card , and you can trim right to the edge of the perforated Teslin and it will stay perfectly sealed.Good product .	1
The Swingline Inspire laminator is wonderful . The price was great and the usefulness is a ten of ten . My wife is a school teacher and my daughter , although she , too taught in public schools , now stays home and home schools our grand daughters . Both of them needed a laminator for preparing teaching aids and other stuff . These pouches are very convenient and work quite well and I will order more when they run out of them . My youngest grand daughter has become a super-laminator so I am sure they will need more . They are simple to use and do a great job of protecting whatever was laminated . I recommend then and the laminator and these pouches to every household even if they have no children . They are compact , efficient and just great to have around .	1
A home laminator is a great value for the money , though I do I find that the commercial laminators at copy shops do a better job.In comparing these pouches to theSwingline Thermal Laminating Pouch , Letter Size , Standard Thickness , 100/Pack ( 3202018 ) , I found them so similar in practical application that I would advise making a choice solely on price ( e.g. , which pouches are on sale at the moment ) .Not being quite clear how lamination works , I also did some destructive testing . Say your little cousin Benny decides to prank you by laminating the loot from the bank heist -- can you get it back out ? To find out , I laminated some bookmarks and then tried to `` cut them out '' of the lamination plastic . Would the plastic adhere to the bookmark paper , or only to itself at the laminated edges ? I discovered that the lamination plastic does adhere to the paper as well , which means you can trim up to or even inside the edge of your laminated paper if you do n't want a blank plastic margin -- but you are n't getting those bills back to their plain-paper state !	1
Works very well , heats evenly and comes out of the machine nice and smooth without bubbles or wrinkling . Great for craft projects !	1
I had to buy these to go with the great deal I got on the laminator they go with . My friend is happy with them .	1
Bought the laminating machine when it was a Prime member special and needed these . I have nearly used them up as they are great .	1
These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size . I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members . She draws a picture and we laminate it . Pretty easy . Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin . I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose . Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5 '' wide pouch .	1
Ok my title says it all , these pouches were reasonably priced , they work exactly as expected , deliver was perfect and they are BIG , I love the legal size , they must go through my laminator lengthwise but it just takes a second or two longer . These work great , you can fill them with smaller items , we make six or eight ID badges at a time by inserting loose cards as they feed into the laminator . Very happy and would buy again .	1
Easy to use pouches - just peel the layers apart , put your letter sized paper up against the crease in the short side , lay flat and feed into the laminator . Job done , with a nice clear finish . I use this form printing photos on regular paper and then protecting them - it 's a cheap way to make 8 & # 34 ; x 11 & # 34 ; prints.Helpful hint : remove promptly form laminator and put under a heavy book for a few seconds while still warm so that the sheet does n't curl up .	1
This is the product that came with my Swingline GBC Fusion 1000L heat laminator . The plastic looks fuzzy before it 's heated . Once it goes through the machine , it becomes clear . The ends tend to curl a little but my projects have turned out nicely . An inexpensive way to archive or preserve my paper documents . I am very pleased with this .	1
Works well for drawer organization .	1
I use this item daily , and it works perfectly . It does n't slide around in the drawer , and the buckets are easy enough to get items in to and out of . I would purchase this item again , if the need arose .	1
very good organizer keep things neat an orderly would recommend this for any desk thank you very much love it . Bjwolf	1
This works perfect for my needs . I put it in a drawer of a Safco Mesh File cart and it pretty well fills it . I did n't want a tray with tiny little compartments for few paper clips and other stuff that usually does n't fit them . The bins in this tray are large and deep enough to store larger items.Good buy , it is heavy and strongly built . I would recommend it .	1
I finally made the plunge and got a drawer organizer for our bathroom drawer . My husband and I have a single drawer in our bathroom so it 's always quite messy filled with toothpaste , hairbrushes , hair ties , floss , bandaids , and more.This Drawer Organizer does the trick ! There is a good variety of compartments that fit all of our items perfectly and I LOVE how deep this organizer is . One of the small compartments holds all of my bobbypins and hair ties perfectly . The longer organizer holds my hairbrush and combs while the middle organizer we keep for toothpaste .	1
Very sturdy , deep drawers . Not cheap feeling or flimsy . Generally what you 'd expect from Rubbermaid . Individual pockets well-proportioned . Would purchase again if needed .	1
I 've very happy with this orginization tray . The deminsions are consistent with the description . Still , when I received it it seemed even bigger . It fits as expected . I really like the deep pocketed sections.I purchased two . One for my desk at work , the other for my `` junk '' drawer at home . Fits my needs .	1
This metal mesh sorter is a nice match to other desk accessories I have . It sits well on my desk and does not move around when I grab files out of it .	1
Oh , this is great ... I put it up in my spare closet and put manualsin it ... great product and is everything the ad said .	1
Got my file folders out of the tub , where they 've hidden for years , and into the light of day.Perfect for me !	1
Great product for keeping all types of folders in transition . Also , good for sorting papers , since its purchased I have discovered multiple uses	1
This is a very good product , in fact I bought this not only to reduce clutter but because I have other Rolodex products that I also like a great deal . They are made well , are light weight but very sturdy so obviously I am pleased with this product line .	1
I purchased one of these as a holder for my school supplies . I love it so much I think I might buy another one for my Textbooks . the book ends I bought were junk . Also perfect for the price ! You really get what you pay for .	1
I would consider buying this because Im able to store pens while important paperwork I need to fill out or whatever	1
Nice simple design . Stores pens and sticky notes securely . Construction is solid.Might not work as a cheese grater just because it has holes . Someone dare me to do it .	1
I have a few things that I always manage to lose on my desk , and this small holder is a perfect size for stickies and stamps and post cards .	1
my favorite part is the space for Post-it 's and you can write on them while in the holder . the piece is compact but yet still seems to hold quite a bit .	1
It is nice and great organizer but a bit smaller than I thought . I bought it for Christmas present . But by look at it , really nice for small desk or overload with stuffs .	1
Simply mesh business card holder that matches the rest of the various big box office supply mesh product styles . It holds business cards just as well as any other stiff rectangular object .	1
I use these as a holder for my smartphone ( Motorolla Droid Razr Maxx HD ) in places like the kitchen counter to watch videos while washing dishes and on the bedside table at night . Works great for this purpose . Would buy again .	1
I ordered this to put my business cards in . It does the job . Nice price , looks okay . Good for basic business cards .	1
Good . I like it . It looks good on my billy book stand . What else I can write about this card holder . Its good .	1
use this to hold my note 2 on my desk at a good angle . best 2 bucks spent ever . nice metal construction is good quality .	1
I have seen these all over the place . They are pretty basic , but the price and functionality are great . I have several .	1
And that problem is the advertisement logo `` eldon '' on the back . I might be picking at nothing here , but a business card holder should advertise the business card that it holds and nothing else . Other than that , what you see is what you get with this . I ended up using a sharpie to color it in so it blends in . Overall , a good buy and certainly worth the couple extra bucks it costs over an acrylic card holder .	1
Perfect for my business cards . Love the mesh design .	1
It 's nice and professional looking ; not cheap at all . I use it at my main table at all my craft shows and it looks wonderful .	1
works great , use this to put our promotional business card at offices . i custom made a small tall card to put on back of the business cards on the stand to & # 34 ; catch your eye & # 34 ; , and it seems to be great ideal .	1
These are just fine for my business cards in the summer outside on the produce stands , etc . They seem to have held up just fine the last summer and they got wet a few times and there is no rust , etc .	1
Light weight , looks modern , and holds my business cards . Ca n't get a better price either !	1
Good little product for making business cards handy on top of the desk.Could use some small rubber feet to keep it from moving so easily . The little think is so light , and there is so little friction between it and the desktop , that it slides away as someone tries to get a grip on a card .	1
Like most people , I have waayyyyy to many electronic devices and find it challenging to store and charge it in an organized way . I bought this for that purpose . The mesh material allows for great ventilation while charging or storing . Looks clean and organized . The product is very well constructed and solid . You do n't feel like it is cheap and flimsy . Will last a long time and looks great on our desk .	1
Originally I bought this in order to stack a modem and a wireless router . However , when I got it I decided to use it in my office to keep small electronics organized.I put a telephone on the top shelf and then a collection of chargers and adapters on the second shelf . The third shelf has earplugs , small cameras , and other electronics . They 're now organized and within easy reach.I like the mesh ; it looks good in an office and it would have worked well for the modem and router as it would have allowed air flow at the bottom of the units .	1
Papers that were filed on the floor are now off the floor and on the shelves wondabar ! ! ! I love it .	1
I have this product on top of my computer table shelf . It looks like it is tilted a bit backwards and the shelf 's front edge is pointing down instead of up to prevent the contents from sliding down , I guess the reason for the slight tilt back . It found the ideal place for my purposes on top of my computer shelf . 5 stars	1
I 've always thought well of Rolodex products and this was no exception . It certainly seems sturdy enough and it looks nice -- came just as pictured.Not a plastic-y product like many similar products of this type .	1
Simple and good design . I can put it anywhere and it looks good . I like that it has hooks for hanging on the wall .	1
I have had mesh waste baskets in the past that cave in on the sides because the are so cheaply made . This is not the case with this one . It is sturdy and the perfect size for under my desk , not so big as to get in the way , not too small so I have to empty it constantly . I 'm very satisfied .	1
Sorry I can not wax lyrical about a trash can . Do NOT put liquids in it . It is too big for grocery store plastic bag , too small for a kitchen trash can liner - I am going to have to investigate to see what size fits . I have to have liners in my trash cans ! Good size in that it fits under the desk and holds a lot - but not large like a kitchen trash can . I have lots of trash ! It is sturdy and can the abuse of being run over or used like a basketball hoop . I bet your house is not as exciting !	1
I did n't think it was so big but does the trick and less trips to empty lol . very sturdy and great product	1
I purchased this wastebasket for my new home office and have been extremely pleased with it . It is solidly built , simply and elegantly designed , and much larger than my previous wastebasket . It is indeed even larger than what I had imagined it to be , and is more than adequate for most of my office waste - small papers , wrappers , etc . It manages to add an extra sense of productivity to my work area , and I expect to be using it for many years to come . Highly recommended .	1
Great functional trash can . I wish it fit plastic grocery sack liners better , but I generally use at office with no liner . Quality is good and price is right . Not much to say about this trash can .	1
The garbage can is actually pretty big , which I like for my office since I throw a lot of papers and envelopes away on a daily basis .	1
This wire mesh wastebasket is simply beautiful . I really like it and it is very well built - not much else to say . But it with confidence .	1
I like this wastebasket . I got the set with the desktop accessory holder . Works great and looks great on my floor .	1
Big enough for all the crumpled paper I have to throw when studying.Feels durable and actually looks nice.Obviously it 's made of meshed wiring so throwing dust and liquids into it is n't a great idea unless you put a plastic bag inside the can.Got my money 's worth .	1
Sturdy , durable and sleek . In three words that sums up this wastebasket ; it is just fantastic . Most of my organizers and other office equipment are black and mesh and this coordinates perfectly with them . Rubbermaid and Rolodex both intermix well especially in this black mesh design . Comparing prices between local stores and Amazon have this product priced nearly the same . I bought this at my local store to have it quicker however it 's cost effective at the current price of under $ 10 no matter where you buy it .	1
I chose this black , mesh wastebasket because it elegantly matches my other office , storage equipment , which are black mesh as well.This basket is roomy , yet small enough to not be intrusive in an office . It is sturdy and well designed.Highly recommended .	1
It 's lightweight , unobtrusive , sturdy , decent sized ( not too small ) . The mesh causes me to be more considerate of what I throw in the basket in my home office . I ca n't imagine ever needing to replace it - but if I do I 'd get another one of these .	1
it is just perfect as I want.however , it is a litter bigger for me ... .it is bigger than 4 gal .	1
OK it 's only a wastebasket , but for the price it is a good quality product . I am buying mesh office products , and this fits in perfectly . It is very functional , and very nice to look at so it does n't spoil the look of your office .	1
the Rolodex 22351 Mesh round wastebasket , 11-1/2 diameter x 14-1/4h , black is a great addition to any office . blends very nicely and is the perfect size to place beside or underneath your desk . Great buy at a great price	1
I am seting up my office in one of my rooms . My niece had moved out to goto college . After she moved out , I bought this product . It looks nice and is a great access to the new office	1
The Rolodex 22351 Mesh round wastebasket looks and performs exactly as expected . Delivered with no dents or dings and ready to use . Looks much better in person , the online pics do n't do it justice.Black finish is smart and mesh is sturdy . Quite a bit of room inside as well . Honestly , for the current asking price of under 15 dollars you ca n't go wrong . Functional and attractive ! Recommended by me , Marty G !	1
I coveted this trash can , which my sister owned for years , until she finally relented and gave it to me . Of course it works perfectly , and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh . That was a concern , as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they 'd eat it . My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag , which means every time I empty it , I have to turn it upside down over the bag . This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot , so if I wait until it 's full , it 's quite heavy . But I do n't care . This is just a wonderfully classy , sturdy waste basket !	1
Great basket . Simple , apparently durable . It 's large for an office trashbin , which is good . It is n't hard to empty it into a plastic bag . I should probably start lining it . It is mesh , so it will be a little hard to clean . Otherwise , I really like it .	1
Loving the look of quality wire mesh accessories , this wastebasket was a perfect choice.It 's just the right size for a home office and fits under the new glass desk ( also from Amazon ) perfectly . What 's particularly nice about both glass and open mesh is they lend the illusion and feeling of more space - an especially nice touch for small spaces.Rolodex has been making top quality products for decades - and although this may merely be a wastebasket they have n't skimped here one bit . The wire is coated with a shiny black enamel . There are no sharp edges or seams - a problem with lesser quality items with a similar look . Even the seam is welded perfectly and completely smooth.The base is well weighted so tip over is n't a problem and the little feet on the bottom keep raised a bit off the floor and level.The basket holds an ample amount of scrunched up papers . As a copywriter by trade I end up with lot 's of scrunched up paper.The wastebasket matches my desk accessories perfectly - so although far from a center piece , it 's a nice touch.It arrived in perfect shape , without a single dent or scratch . These baskets really do sell for around $ 30 and up - to find this here on Amazon for a mere $ 9.82 is an absolute steal . Plus if you 're a Prime member , this item is eligible so two day shipping is 100 % free.A great addition to any office - at an unbeatable price .	1
I just got this today and as much as I like the quality it does seem a bit large for a desk trash receptacle . I know the small garbarge bags I have for my bathroom trash can wo n't fit . Not sure how much I 'll be able to use it unlined , which will just make it a pain to empty out .	1
I needed a small wastebasket for under my desk and this one fits perfectly plus it 's not plastic . I can trash things as needed instead of letting it pile up on my desk . Reasonably priced too .	1
This paper tray is very practical and strong . If you are looking for a paper tray for everyday use this is a good one .	1
I bought this for home use - these were piling up on my desk , so I wanted a place to put the mail and paperwork in my office while it waited around for me to get to it . This does the job . Is it elegant ? I would n't go that far , but it looks better than a clear plastic inbox tray .	1
Highly recommended to anyone looking for an elegant tray to place on their counter top . It 's really that simple . Well constructed , looks great , and effective . Non-slip feet help it say in place .	1
I have had two of these trays for a few years . I did at one point buy the ( sold separately ) spacers to stack them , but I 've never been a fan of stacked trays and abandoned that idea . I keep these side-by-side on my desk , using them as a pair of `` In '' and `` Next '' boxes for David Allen 's _Getting Things Done_ method of organizing tasks.These perfectly match my cherry desk -- so much so that they look like a set . I have a bunch of the other desk accessories in this series ( pencil cups , etc . ) and they all look fantastic . Elegant without the overdone aluminum mesh . Sturdy , useful , and about the right price if you 're on a budget without degrading into black plastic.Highly recommended .	1
I bought this to put atop my black printer so that my roommate had a place to put her things rather than all over my tabletop . It fits 8 x 12 paper perfectly , and is able to accomodate her purses . The look is very classy	1
Excellent quality . Very sharp blade so definitely watch your fingers . Blade is straight and cuts cleanly . A must have for anyone needing to trim cards or photos .	1
Speaking , IN the spirit of Ebenezer Scrooge , for someone that cut the tip of [ my ] left thumb clean-off with a U.S.Army deluxe model -- -with-out -- - a thumb-guard : `` Bah ! ... ... You NEED the thumb-guard . If you actually have a projuct that requires `` closer up '' work ... use scissors ! It 's dangerous a-n-ddumb ( for yourthumb ) to disable the guard-rail ! ''	1
I wanted a large paper trimmer for trimming paper beyond the standard 8 1/2 X 11 & # 34 ; without spending a fortune . I also wanted one that would hold up to use . This trimmer has met the first need . Only time will tell how it holds up to use but since I take care of my office equipment I expect that it will . It 's not very heavy overall but the cutting blade has some heft to it . So far I 've only used it to slice some heavy stock paper and that was no effort whatsoever . The cut is true when you line it up flush with the back edge of the trimmer . It is attractive as well and looks good in the office . There is a nice metal clip that will lock the blade down when not in use .	1
I was in love with the OLD guillotine cutters from my youth ... this one matches it ! Blade is sharp , good safety features , easy to use . Once you get used to the measuring features it 's quite nice too . I love the blade handle lock feature too .	1
I was using scissors to cut tons of labels for work , and it would start to hurt my hand after a while.This paper cutter looks great , and behaves just as I need it to . I did n't need perfection , I just needed to cut down double printed labels quickly , and I like howcompact it is.It comes with a arm lock which is safe too , especially with clumsy me and pets around.Am pleased .	1
We do a lot for our sons PTA , so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not . We had a small 6 ' cutter , that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth , and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from . The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp ' like thing to put on your paper while cutting . So basically , if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force . The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving . However , this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller ; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review .	1
** Pros **I was able to cut through 8 sheets of paper fairly easily . Note , however , that it requires a little exertion to cut through 10 or more sheets . The cutting blade is very sharp and is self-sharpening . The manual says each cut actually sharpens the blade so the blade never gets dull . The trimmer makes nice clean cuts and is able to cleanly shave off the tiniest piece from the edge of the paper . It is built very sturdy , and the Swingline brand name promises exceptional durability and performance . The trimmer looks sharp ( pun not intended ) and will make a handsome addition to the stationery in your home or office . ** Cons **The guard rail is about an inch from the cutting edge , so this cutter might not be suited for very small jobs . The board on the trimmer is not constructed from solid wood but from a chipboard slab . The top is laminated to make the board look like solid wood . ( As an upside , however , the markings are clearly printed and the laminate is so realistic looking that initially I thought the board was made of solid wood ) . The underside of the trimmer is somewhat crudely constructed ( Can you say fussy ? ) . ** Conclusion **Functionally , this trimmer gets a resounding 5-stars ! Construction-wise , I wish the board was made of solid wood . Also , the guard rail gets in the way of very small jobs . All in all , the Swingline ClassicCut Guillotine Paper Trimmer is a really good paper trimmer , and considering the price , it is a good value for your money ! If the specifications meet your needs , I would definitely recommend it .	1
Nice looking , sturdy , and does a great job - a great deal for the price ! I really like how the arm stays in position when you have it up - not loose at all . Took this one to work and plan to get another for home .	1
It 's nearly all-plastic ( feels cheap but it looks okay from a distance ) with the exception of the blade itself which appears to be thin steel and the bolts that keep it together . The only assembly needed is attaching the handle ( just push it in ) onto the blade assembly.The trimmer features : - inch and metric rulers- a protective guard rail- a blade latch hook- a largely meaningless 10-year limited warranty ( you pay for shipping , does not cover the blade ) Putting it to the test , I found that it does cut photo paper well . The cut is straight and the blade cuts through the paper with no difficulty . Because of the guard rail , I doubt that you can squeeze more than a few sheets at a time but that 's not a big issue for me because I will be cutting photos only and I doubt that I will ever stack more than 2 or 3 sheets at the most.Inside the box there 's a note that says that Swingline is GBC 's new name.One ( almost ) good comment on the seller . Shipping was quick and the item came in perfect condition but the packaging was n't exactly state of the art.__________________________Six months update : Still cuts well so that self-sharpening claim on the blade may hold some truth . On the other hand , I only cut a couple hundred sheets so I can say it 's great for casual use and it COULD be good for heavier cutting activities .	1
By way of disclosure , I received a sample of this product for evaluation purposes.The only guillotine trimmer I ever used with any frequency was my mother 's . It was a heavy unit , made largely of hardwood with a heavy spring-loaded arm . It was hardly portable -- it weighed a lot.This Swingline trimmer is much lighter , with the surfaces made of plastic . It 's easy to get it out when you have a job that calls for it.It has a sharp blade that cuts paper cleanly without requiring excessive force . It is reasonably stable on a table.It can deal with sheets of paper bigger than the standard 8.5 & # 34 ; x11 & # 34 ; size , having a 15 & # 34 ; cutting length . If you need to trim legal paper lengthwise , this trimmer can do it.Overall , it is a fine trimmer and is n't too expensive . If you only need a trimmer for occasional use , I 'd recommend it .	1
This is an upgrade from a very old paper cutter , so it 's a huge improvement for me . I like how lightweight it is so it 's easy for me to move from room to room if I need to . The blade is great and cuts very cleanly from top to bottom .	1
This thing is great . Works perfect , I have not had any issues with it at all . We got this at a really good price , it was more durable than I thought it would be .	1
It 's sharp , has a built-in ruler , and makes nice cuts.I got this to do random cropping and trimming of documents in my home office.When working with standard 8.5 x 11 paper , I find that I could use a larger model of paper cutter . This one still cuts really well , but having another 3 or 4 inches of working space would be nice.It can easily cut 3 pages at a time .	1
I have used its 12-inch sibling for over a year now , and have been very impressed with its functioning and its reliability.Except for its length , this trimmer is identical in all respects , including the ease with which it can be setup.I have used it for all sort of projects for the kids , including cutting photo stock for passport photographs , and the cuts are clean and true.It definitely works as advertised.~A_E~	1
This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office . I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12 & # 34 ; x12 & # 34 ; . This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed . The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight . It is easy to handle and you wo n't hurt your back when you pick it up . The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage . The blade is very , very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use . It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety . I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses	1
I 've tried out 3 paper cutters just this year . I use it daily for work , many times a day -- I sent out samples of products and for sample labels I just hand cut the labels before sending and also cut out the mailing labels . That means lots of cutting , and some of it on sticky backed surfaces . I also use paper cutters in my art.This one , by far , outperformed all the others , even my commercial ones . It 's amazing that it 's so lightweight , but cuts so easily , even bigger stacks of paper.Most seem to cut by shaving the blade up close to the metal bar rather than by having a good and sharp blade . This means more resistance and pulling -- -This one is a light easy pull but fast and accurate cut . Far better.My other cutters tend to make the paper move , crooked , so precise cuts are not as easy -- this one kept the paper just where I place it for straight cuts.Also a few of my others have a large protector so you ca n't easily see where you are cutting . This has a small bar . Whereas I wound up removing the protector on some other paper cutters because it was in the way of my site , I can leave this one on , meaning fingers are protected but I can still see.This one is longer than may others so long pieces of paper are no issueAnd the guides on the cutter make it simple to align items straight , whether vertically or horizontally.Best cutter I 've owned in years , for sure .	1
I was looking for a relatively inexpensive trimmer for our office and this unit has been great . Nicely made , decent weight and a very sharp blade . Perhaps most importantly , the mechanism operates clean and tight and appears to be built to stay that way for a long time .	1
I received this 15-inch model for review from Amazon . I already own the same trimmer but in the 12-inch model . They 're both the same except for the size.The trimmer is mostly plastic and feels lightweight , but it stays stable when cutting and is solidly built . The lightness of the unit is actually a plus for me sincce I keep it in the closet until I need it . It 's easy to move around.Assembly is easy -- you basically slot the arm in and you 're ready to go . I use my 12-inch model about once a week . I cut about five sheets at a time to make sure the cut is straight , but I think you could get away with up to 10 . The same is true for the 15-inch model.I 'd give five stars to this unit if it were just a bit less expensive . But compared to a wooden cutter , the price is reasonable . If I were using the cutter more often and to cut more than paper ( say , thicker paper or cardboard stock ) , I 'd think about getting a more sturdy model . But with this model , the blade stays sharp and is more than adequate for paper cutting .	1
This Swingline Lite Classic Cut is a standard size cutter but is light weight so you can move it around if needed . It 's nice to cut coupons or whatever else you may be doing like craft projects . It is easy to move around and store if you have the room . Because it was called & # 8220 ; lite & # 8221 ; , I thought it would be a smaller size but it 's just lighter in weight than others that I 've used . It still takes up quite a bit of room.It has measurement markings and a grid on the the cutting board to help with measuring and lining up your cutting projects.There is a locking mechanism for the arm which is nice . I have another one that you can not lock the arm in place and I worry about the safety of that one.I noticed that is states it is for the occasional 10-sheet cutting project so I think this would be suited to homework , coupons , etc but may not stand up to daily use in an office or classroom .	1
This is a really high quality paper cutter . The base is a nice sturdy , solid piece that stays in place on the table ( no wobbling or anything ) , the blade is super tight to the board and this ensures a tight cut right where you want it . The ruler guide is nice and easy to read and use with paper on the board and the top is solid enough to allow paper to flush against it to ensure a straight cut . The unit cuts through card stock and thick piles of standard paper with no problem and leaves a smooth perfect cut line . It also has a lock to lock the handle down so you do not cut yourself when moving it , this is easy to unlock and use.In the end , this is a great paper cutter . It cuts through piles of paper ( max is 10 and it does that perfectly ) and heavier papers with no problem . It has a nice look and a large working area for cutting oversize papers and a sharp tight blade that cuts paper smoothly without tear marks . This is a great cutter and works amazingly ! Highly recommend ! ! !	1
perfect for my rare needs to cut paper . i like this , and i 've always wanted one . so far i 've used it to cut papers in quarters for party invitations . cheaper and easy .	1
cuts fairly straight . decent desktop cutting board . I would recommend it to people who is looking for this type of product . only issue is , you have to be careful to line up top and bottom so it cuts straight , also , you can not cut unless you have enough thickness on both sides of the blade . ca n't really shave a thin slice of paper to adjust an edge as it just folds over .	1
I really like this Swingline Trimmer . It 's very easy to use , lightweight and easier to store than the big , heavy ones . It performs well , can easily cut ten sheets of paper at a time . I 've used it for a lot of paper crafts , cutting heavy cardstock with ease and accuracy . The paper is easy to line up , so you get satisfying results . I 've had quite a few trimmers , and they never really lived up to my expectations . I have a very expensive Martha Stewart trimmer which is a huge disappointment , difficult to line up and and the cuts are often slightly off , which drives me crazy . This trimmer far surpasses that one , for less than half the price . I 'd highly recommend for scrapbookers and other crafters , for students ( with parental supervision , of course ) . There is a lockable safety latch on the side to prevent accidents while not in use . Very pleased with this product .	1
Our cub scout leader last year let me borrow one of these to cut out all our homemade den doodles , ribbons , etc . It worked like a charm so I had to have one myself for all the scrapbooking I do at home . Great price , arrived in perfect condition and the blade on this is wonderful . I 've been using it for a few months now , absolutely no problems with cutting through anything yet . Love the side lock so that my 4 year old ca n't get curious . Highly recommended !	1
If you need a good accurate large format paper cutter , look no farther . This Swingline gets the job done quickly and precisely . Our only concern about it relates to the weight . It is made of composite material which makes it lighter than wood and it tends to move around a bit when using it . On the other hand , if it were made of solid oak or other hard wood , it would take two people to move it around from place to place . Good product and worth the money .	1
I like this for making straight consistent cuts - I 've used it to print 2 flyers or cards on 1 piece of paper and cut it in half . The blade is extremely sharp and the board is lightweight plastic . I easily store this under my bed to keep it out of the way and off a desk .	1
I 've used a lot of these guillotine trimmers at schools and half thought it would be one of those but when this arrived , I found that it really is a `` lite '' copy of one of them . And considering that one of those institutional ones can cost 3 times as much , this is not bad.Except for the blades and the green rail , the body is completely made of plastic . It 's light weight , which means it 'll be easy to move around , but it also means that when you lift the blade , you will need to push the body down , otherwise the whole body just comes up.Function : You use a cutter mainly to make long straight cuts or for craft work when scissors wo n't work or you do n't want to use a ruler and a craft knife . As such the cutter works well enough . The website says you can cut up to 10 sheets at once , which seems generous but doable with a lot of effort and I mean a lot . I probably would n't do more than 6 pieces to avoid dulling the blade or breaking something . In any case , the green safety rail limits the amount of paper you can feed into the blade.Thinking to the future , I think I would use this cutter mainly for precision work , rather than heavy duty cutting due to it 's `` lite '' nature.Safety : It has a small lock that prevents the blade when not in use . It is definitely safer than the institutional cutters I 've used before but it is still very sharp and can definitely take fingers off.Overall , an inexpensive light version of an institutional strength cutter . Good for the price and precision work when you want to have accurate straight cuts . I 'm thinking that this will probably see a lot of use in our home .	1
The Swingline Classic Cut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmer is exactly what it says , it 's LIGHT , and it cuts very well . The lightness of the product does make it feel a bit cheap , but I think it will hold up just fine ... .it 's a desktop item , not something you 're going to throw around or jump on ! There are two sets of measuring guides , on at the top of the cutter and another about 5 inches down which is kind of nice , the entire bed of the cutter it filled with grids so it 's easy to make sure that your paper is lined up straight , very useful for cutting smaller items.I am very happy with this cutter , a great replacement for my old heavy elephant of a cutter , definitely worth it !	1
Any parent with kids in school has stayed up way past their bedtime working on projects the little darling `` forgot '' to tell you about until the night before it was due . I 've had blisters on my fingers from cutting and cutting by hand , so I decided to buy one of these paper cutters for the next time . I bought mine at Walmart , for about $ 26.I was a little put off by the all-plastic base and unit 's overall light weight , but with 100 little squares to cut out for the latest school project I was willing to give it a try . I 'm very happy with the way it works , although it takes a little practice to cut exactly where you want it to . The blade is SUPER sharp ( my bleeding knuckle assures you ) and the cutter should only be used by adults . It cuts up to 10 regular pages ( about 5 pages of construction paper ) with ease . In fact , it works better with 2 or more pages than with one.One hint I learned is that you need to hold the paper very securely with your left hand , so it ca n't be pulled crooked as you lower the blade with your right hand . Also , as you lower the cutting bar to cut , use a slight inward pressure on the handle , to keep the blade slicing right up against the guide.This is a great little paper cutter and I 'm `` looking forward '' to all those late nights when we 'll be chopping and pasting .	1
This replaced a smaller , somewhat flimsier paper cutter and while that one was merely adequate , I feel this one is ideal for home use . It will accurately and neatly cut up to 10 sheets of standard paper or approximately 5 pieces of medium card stock at a time . While this may fall short in an office setting , for our needs at home , it does a great job.Although it 's considerably lighter , smaller and easier to store , it shares several important features with its more expensive commercial cousins . It has an alignment grid and a ruler to ensure that your cuts are accurate and it boasts important safety features such as a guard rail and a blade lock to prevent you from cutting something you do n't intend to . And that 's a good thing too because the die-cast metal blade is very sharp to begin with and is self-sharpening as well.The Swingline ClassicCut Lite Guillotine Trimmer is a well-made product that fulfills its promise .	1
I bought this because of the cheap price . It does feel a bit cheap , but it definitely does its job and I would not hesitate to purchase another one . It cuts a nice clean line and I have no real complaints !	1
This paper trimmer looks cheap ( the body is gray plastic ) , but is sturdy and reliable and more than meets all our small office needs . Love the grid that helps you keep the paper straight . If you need more than a few sheets at a time cut , or other features like a spring-loaded arm , you should invest in a more expensive heavy-duty trimmer . But this is more than adequate for us and a welcome addition to our office equipment , as I ca n't cut a straight line with scissors to save my life !	1
This is a plastic Guillotine from Swingline . All that plastic and light weight may make it feel a bit on the cheaper side , especially if you are used to the heavier guillotine . But , this works just as well . It comes with the usual inch and metric ruler and the alignment grid . It has a protective guardrail to protect your precious little fingers.I have used it for about 3 weeks now and it has worked well . It cuts in straight lines and the cut is neat . I really like it and it has replaced my old guillotine ( which I gave back to my sister ... the original owner ) .	1
The Swingline ClassicCut delivers crisp , clean cuts . It is well made and sturdy - sure to last many , many years.My only ding ( and it is a small one ) is that I wish there were suction cups on the bottom to secure it firmly to the table.I make my own business cards , printed on heavy-stock paper , and use the Swingline ClassicCut to cut them individual cards . The built-in guide makes that process fast and easy.I also like printing 4-6 photos on larger-sized photo paper and the Swingline enables me to cut these into perfect separate photos.I can not cut a straight line with a pair of scissors to save my life - and thankfully I do n't have to try now that I rely on my Swingline ClassicCut . Two thumbs up .	1
I purchased this paper cutter for home paper craft projects . It 's very light , yet sturdy . I found the blade to be sharp and precise . The workspace is large enough to keep the paper supported and straight for most projects . I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because the blade is not sharp enough to do an edge trim . Based on what I was cutting , it ca n't go less than 1/8 & # 34 ; without chewing the side of the paper .	1
I have used this for everything from coupons to my son 's school photos . I found this to be a very useful item for my home office , coming in handy when I printed out tickets on card stock and when cutting I got a clean , crisp , sharp edge and no fraying or tearing . I think that in a home or home office where you have lots of items to cut that this would make a useful addition to decrease the time spent cutting things .	1
In short , I am impressed by how very lightweight this trimmer is . If you want to be able to pick up your trimmer and easily move it to another room , I highly recommend this.If you want a little more detail ... Paper trimmers usually have heavy wooden bases , probably so that they wo n't slide around during use . But that extra weight means that you ca n't easily move the trimmer from room to room if you are working on a project . By contrast , this Swingline & # 34 ; Lite & # 34 ; trimmer is probably about as light as it could possibly be and still remain functional . It is very easy to carry around with one hand.The base is a thin but sturdy plastic . In addition to the four corner supports on the bottom of the base , there is a fifth support in the center of the bottom . No doubt , this extra support is necessary on such a thin trimmer in order to keep it from sagging in the middle when holding your papers in place.I am also pleased with the accurate cuts . Some trimmers I 've used seem to give me consistently crooked cuts . Not so with this Swingline . Whether I cut one or ten pieces of paper , I have never been disappointed by the cutting.If I could gripe about one thing ( maybe worth a half-star deduction ) , it would be this : I find that the safety latch for locking down the arm is a little tricky to access . It 's a bit & # 34 ; tucked away & # 34 ; under the arm itself , making it a little harder to lock and unlock . However , because it 's such a light trimmer , it 's easy to pick up the entire trimmer with one hand and tilt it until I find the latch.All in all , this is really a great trimmer . Do n't be put off by the & # 34 ; Lite & # 34 ; in its title .	1
****I also own a heavy wooden guillotine trimmer that is a really completely different caliber product . This Swingline is much lighter and for me , who uses it only occasionally , perfect . I have had no problems with its operation and everything works great ; it also cuts a straight line on several sheets of paper , which is the most I would use . It is a much cheaper-quality product than the heavy wooden trimmer . If I could have just one I would pick the more expensive product as I am sure it will perform better over time as well as last longer . The advantage of this Swingline trimmer is that it is light and portable and can be stored easily in small areas.Another good use for this trimmer would be as a second trimmer , since it is 15 inches long . It is a good price compared to the heavy 15-inch wooden trimmers . If you do a lot of trimming and have the room , you could use a sturdy wooden guillotine trimmer for everyday usage and then this longer lighter one for speciality trimming of longer/wider items.All in all , recommended for light use , but especially as a second trimmer . *****	1
Over the last few months I have turned into one of those & # 34 ; Krazy Coupon Ladies & # 34 ; , and let me tell you clipping coupons by hand sucks ( especially when you are buying 6+ newspapers a week ) . So when I saw this trimmer I jumped at the chance to try it out.Its my new best friend and literally cuts my clipping time in half . I line up 6 pages ( state you can do up to 10 ) and swipe swipe they are neatly cut out and ready to be filed . The blade is quiet sharp and I really like that you can lock it . I made sure my kids are n't aware of this feature so they cant play with it.This trimmer is pretty light weight so that helps me move it from spot to spot if i need to and i really do n't mind that i have to hold it to move the blade up and down . Its very sturdy though and seems like it will last for a long time . Overall I 'm really happy with this product and have already recommended it to several of my friends and family that also use coupons .	1
When I first got it , it was so lightweight that I thought & # 34 ; this thing ca n't be much more than a toy , but it surprised me . It cuts straight and clean . I like the way it 's marked for measuring . It says it will cut & # 34 ; up to 10 sheets & # 34 ; which it does . I really do n't need more than that at home anyway . I 'm used to the beast we have where I used to work . The thing weighed a lot and it felt very substantial . This does n't have the weight , but it does seem to be a good product for what I need . After I got over my first impression that it was flimsy , I find I like that it 's lightweight so I can move it easily with one hand . My son just started back to college studying art and photography . He has already used it and is happy with it as well . Score !	1
I often make oversized prints of my photographs and to save money and time I 'll have my local office supply store print them on good quality stock that is often not perfectly sized to the print . I use this unit to make super-clean straight cuts . It is not a heavy duty machine but it could handle 5-6 sheets easily.Be warned though that the more sheets in a stack to cut , the greater the chance that the edges will not be precise . If you need it perfect , do one sheet at a time .	1
Great value for the money . I was hesitant to buy it after looking at a much more expensive wooden one . This was well worth the money , does everything I need and was very affordable .	1
Thank goodness , this thing actually cuts ! Previously , I had bought a cheap paper cutter and it just did n't do the job and basically 'ate ' my paper because it tore it up so badly . This works so much better , and the blade seems to be quite sharp . I will say that it seems to work better with more than one sheet of paper at one time . If you are cutting a long single sheet of paper , then I would recommend that you hold it down in the middle/opposite end of the way the blade swings or it could possible raise up some ( the paper itself ) . Sort of hard to explain , but it may happen . What I did was take a piece of cardboard and set it on top of the paper so it stays stable . If all else fails , just flip the paper upside down and cut the part you were having issues with from the top . One thing I do n't really understand is the bar that goes across- next to the blade . If this was adjustable , it would be great ; but I have n't seen or found a way to lower it so it is pretty pointless . All in all , an affordable cutter that works well .	1
This is a case of you get what you pay for . This is not a device meant for heavy use . It is not the solid metal , hurt your back moving cutter that some of us used when young and in school . However , it is patterned off of that . This is made with a plastic and is solid and rigid ( not flimsy at all ) . It is heavy enough to stay in place while cutting and has the typical ruler in the middle of the platform . The trimmer cuts with a crisp and solid feel to the swing arm action . I had no issues whatsoever cutting.The blade is solid metal and sharp . It has a safety catch - if I had one thing to improved , I would make that more solid and more obvious ... make it a bright red plastic . It is currently a little stainless steel catch people can easily not be aware of.This product is great for little projects . Trimming photos , etc . Over Christmas I had been making a lot of laminated certificates as a joke gift . I really wish I had this cutter at the time.For the price ( ~35 ) , I really like the functionality for the value of this product .	1
This is n't the biggest , heaviest or sturdiest guillotine cutter in the world , for sure . It 's fairly small , and plastic-y . But , it actually does a pretty great job as long as you take your time . It 's very lightweight , which is great if you need to move it around , but it 's easy to make it shift around accidentally when you 're using it . But as long as you line up what you 're cutting well and cut smoothly , and do n't try to cut more than a half-dozen or so pages at once , you 'll get a perfect , clean cut .	1
The Swingline ClassicCut is lightweight and very sharp . The safety latch is under the handle , and snaps securely into place , making it safer than other safety latches . There is a ruler built into the top and middle of the surface , and the middle ruler includes metric . The Swingline looks nice , and matches the picture . It will cut 10 sheets , but for straight cuts I would recommend no more than 5 or 6 . Overall , a good product .	1
I got this primarily for cutting photos . Very sharp blade ... cuts are very smooth and precise . The entire cutter , aside from the blade , is made of plastic ... it 's extremely lightweight , however it 's also very sturdy . My last two cutters were made mostly of a wood base , but this board seems more durable then those.Extremely happy and would recommend .	1
Starting making bookmarks and other laminate projects to have a variety of items for craft shows . It was taking too much time cutting out each item , laminating them and then cutting the laminate with scissors . This trimmer has eliminated the problem . I was surprised at how easily it cuts through even 5 mil laminate also . Lightweight but very durable . A must have .	1
I bought this for cutting post cards out of 110lb cardstock . It seems to be a fraction of a degree shy of a square 90 deg . corner ( acute ) . It is however a very small degree of difference , and can be easily compensated for if you carefully eyeball the lineup of your paper with the edge/blade . Blade is relatively sharp , construction seems sturdy enough .	1
If you are used to the old wooden paper cutters , like I am , than you may be a little disappointed . This is made of plastic and metal and does n't have the same old solid feel that the wood and metal cutters did . But it still works just fine . I did realize after I got it that it did n't have a paper guide for repeated cutting of the same size paper though . I use ours to cut used paper from our printer in half to make scratch paper and I thought I would hate not having the guide , but it has not been an issue . I am satisfied with this product.I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products . I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product . You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes . I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own .	1
This paper cutter works great . I use it for a laminating project and I love it . I could n't be happier with it .	1
Was looking for a lightweight cutter that was n't too bulky but could still handle several sheets . I love this cutter . The guidelines are clearly marked and the blade cuts easily . No ripped/bent papers . Easily goes through 10 sheets at a time . Perfect for a small office .	1
First of all , the handle is not installed , you need to root around in the box for it . Takes one second to put on.Just got finished cutting out flashcards from cardstock , 750 of them ( so over 300 cut ) and 200 sheets of regular paper in half ( 400 cuts ) . Also tried it on photos.Pros : It easily cuts 6 sheets of cardstock ( 110lb weight ) consistentlyRaised edge makes it pretty easy to keep stacks of paper straight.It will cut & # 8220 ; slivers & # 8221 ; ( as small as 2mm wide ) off of sturdy paper ( photo paper or cardstock ) .Easy to store , it is pretty lightweight . With the green handle installed it is 22in ( including handle ) by 13in by 2.75 deep ( the handle part ) You can lock the arm in place.Cons : With regular paper , it has a harder time with slivers , it tends to smoosh the paper a bit.I wish it had labels across the top , not just of inches and cm but where to align for cutting standard sheets in half ( for both long and short directions ) . I ended up marking these on it with a Sharpie to speed up my project.This is NOT a product for use in a school or if you have to cut hundreds of sheets of paper every day . It is great for home use .	1
If you want to cut large pieces of paper straight , this is a great choice for home . It works just like the big heavy-duty paper cutters at the elementary schools . You lift up the arm with the sharp blade , slide the paper where you want it and bring the arm down to cut . It & # 8217 ; s got marks to measure any length up to 15 inches and provides a nice , straight cut.For the most part , it works very well for me . I tried to cut eight pages of 22 pound regular copy paper and found that was too much . The middle of the blade got stuck , or wouldn & # 8217 ; t easily cut . I found six pages worked better . This unit is light-weight and easy to move around . It works best on a sturdy surface like a table or counter . The only thing I don & # 8217 ; t like about it is that it won & # 8217 ; t fit in the box when fully assembled . It came with the handle not attached to the cutting arm . It popped on easily , but to store it in the closed box , I would have to remove the handle . I don & # 8217 ; t want the handle to get loose over time from being removed and put back on , so I store it with the end of the box open and hope not too much dust gets in .	1
I really like these little clips ( they are very little ) and the colors just make them more interesting . At this price , you can not go wrong and the quality is just fine .	1
binder clips fit the bill when one has only a few sheets of paper to be held together . The multiple color pack is a definite easy on the eyes . They are sturdy and strong ; built for the smaller job .	1
These are nice , colorful mini binder clips that are a must for any office environment . They do what they are supposed to do : hold papers together .	1
These clips only open about a 1/2 & # 34 ; but work better than paper clips for keeping more documents together securely . They do n't really eliminate paper clips , they just hold more . I think reasonably priced especially with Prime .	1
When they call these binder clips mini , they mean mini . I was n't expecting the huge 1.5 or 1.25 inch binder clips , but I was expecting something that would do more than paper clips.Just be warned , if you are looking for something smaller than those huge binder clips , but not mini ( hence the name ) , buy the `` medium '' size.If you are looking for something to hold papers .05 % better than paper clips , these are perfect for you .	1
They 're push-pins . They do what you 'd think that they would . There seem to be about the proper number , but I certainly have n't counted . My only gripe , and why it 's 4 stars , is that the box that it came in does n't clasp fully closed . I 'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic , two little nubs . One of the nubs is missing . Still holds together alright , but I would n't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything . It came like this . Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and was n't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins . Except , does n't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them , and then you realize that you do n't have any anywhere ? They 're like safety pins in that way.Anyway . Good push pins . Meh container .	1
Good price and quality	1
Push pins arrived as expected and are performing as expected . The box that the pins is in does n't close very well , but the pins themselves are fine .	1
Overall : recommend this item . The pushpins are great , they do the job . 5-stars would be awarded if the box did not pop open so easily . I would purchase item again .	1
These clips are exactly what I was looking for . I had n't purchased them at a store because the price was so expensive . The Amazon price was quite reasonable which allowed me to make a guilt-free purchase . Now I do n't feel as if I need to save them only for special projects because I have a dozen of them !	1
I started using these ever since we had to use the new coversheets on the TPS reports . It 's just we 're putting new coversheets on all the TPS reports before they go out now . So if you could go ahead and try to remember to do that from now on , that 'd be great . All right !	1
I always have these on hand and use them in all sorts of ways . Here is a short list ... 1 . Keeps potato chip , cereal , and other bags tightly rolled up2 . Have thumb tacks or screws to hang these on for papers , photos , even magazines3 . Clothes line hangers ! Work much better than the wooden sets and no spring to fail4 . Hold cables together for organization . Need to unplug something ? Just open it up and close back on the remaining cables ! 5 . When working on my car I use these to hold wires and other small things out of the way6 . On an aquarium use these not just to organize your cable but to move airline tube out of sight . Use a thumbtack to keep it where you want it7 . Hang the floor mats from your car to hose them off . I have screws setup just for this purpose . Leave them hanging to dry8 . TortureThere are many more ways to use these and I am sure people have great suggestions ! Add them to the comments on this review ! For the money you just can not beat the versatility . These well made clips will last a long time and are completely worth buying over and over again .	1
ACCO Binder Clips ( in all 4 sizes ) are good binder clips . They come in Large , Medium , Small , and Mini sizes . Have used them for years .	1
These come in one of those standard cheap plastic containers which is always a bummer because you end up needing to put them in something else eventually . However , the price was great for a 30 count of various sizes . The only size lacking is the very large ones which I do have occasion to use when I 'm unable to use anything but . That or sit with a whole puncher forever and put them into a binder . The shipping was quick and they were in pristine condition when they arrived . I have n't as of yet had a problem with them not being durable which is big bonus so great material .	1
I have used other brands and while it is difficult to say there is a lot of difference between the various brand I have noticed something recently on my older clips . There are small rust places appearing , thus I tossed many of those and went to this clip . These clips are made very sturdy and they should last me a long time .	1
Binder clips are in style . You 've got to have several sizes so you can use the correct size for each job . And you do n't need fancy looking , multi-colored binder clips as studies show they do n't impress as much as using appropriate size.This was a good deal so I added it to my extensive binder clip pipeline .	1
Ordered these as a general necessity in the office and have had no problems . They were priced well and came quickly , will buy more !	1
These are well made and have several uses . I keep these on hand and use them as binder clips as well as a handy clamp for craft projects .	1
I can jam a lot more into one of these honkin ' clips than I ever could with a paper clip . They 're also good for other things that need a good clamping . For example , I use a pair to hold up old drapes in the garage since I 'm too lazy and cheap to do it properly , it 's a garage .	1
Undamaged package . Product as described . $ 3 at my local office supply store . I use these often and I lose them before they break . Will be ordering again .	1
A clip is a clip . same clip as you will find at Stapes , etc. , but at a better price and without tax . I am happy that Amazon has many of the office supplies that we need and ... with Amazon Prime , we can get them within a 1-2 days and with no shipping costs	1
This is a very strong mid-size binder clip that will be very useful . There is nothing special about the clip but the price seemed fair . I would buy again and that 's the reason for the 5 star rating .	1
The picture made it look like it was a bit bigger turns out it was those super tiny clips . Even though I know description may say its length however the picture makes it look bigger so beawareother than that its a great product !	1
Wow , what a nice surprise . These are strong and solid . And they really grip . I like these better than the 1 & # 34 ; ones !	1
These binder clips are the same ones you see in the office products stores except they are much less expensive and free shipping when you order enough on any one order . They work as advertised .	1
I use these clips for everything . There a good size not to big and not to small . I do also buy the small ones . They 're good too . But you can do so much more with the medium size .	1
These boxes empty automatically ; I have no idea where they get to . Occasionally I 'll notice one under a screw on a cabinet door where 'food storage ' lists or whatever is clipped . And there must be dozens of them clipped , two each , to a half inch of documents that no longer require a binder but are still used occasionally . But we 've been buying these for 50 years ... where have they gone ? One clever use is as a handle for 'little things '' ; you clip them on , then slide the chrome pieces off the spring steel portions and just use what is left . We 've got an ancient chest in the barn with one of these clipped onto each of the tiny drawer pulls so they 're easier to grip .	1
When you hit that 2:15 in the afternoon nappy feeling and your mind is anywhere but on work , see how long you can leave one of these clipped to your ear or tongue . The bigger ones are far more forgiving , by the way.When it 's time to focus back on work , these are incredibly good at clipping any number of papers together . A must have !	1
I am a bit OCD when it comes to my school books/notes/etc organization . These binder clips help me keep my page in my planner , keep chapter work together when I remove it from my binder ( like after being tested ) , and to keep my page in my notebook . Best of all , they help you keep organized at a very affordable price .	1
the price is good . I donated to school for school suppplies . the clips are good on the fingers to press .	1
This Acco 2 Inch Large Binder Clips , Black , 12 Pack ( A7072100B ) comes in very handy for daily needs ... .so much easier than other methods of clasping .	1
They work ! They do just what they 're supposed to do ! What more can I say even though they want me to say more !	1
Who gets excited about binder clips ? I guess I do . I use them as & # 34 ; chip clips & # 34 ; , to close sacks of flour and other pantry items , to hang gloves and hats , you name it . If it can be clipped I use these . Killer price too ! Get them in every size , you 'll use them .	1
Well , what can I say -- they 're binder clips . They work , they are sturdy , they are functional , they do the job . I like them just fine .	1
I 've been using all three sizes of binder clips ( large , medium and small ) to collect and save documents ( primarily for for my paid bills and tax information files ) . These work great if you have more sheets than can readily be grouped under a Gem paper clip . Buy'em , try 'em , you 'll like 'em !	1
Each one works just fine , nothing wrong with packaging , at an unbeatable price too . These really come in handy , will buy again .	1
Good price , bottom line . They work as designed - actually a little tight out of the box , whihc is not a negative ( give those fingers a work-out ! )	1
Item came correctly and matched the description . These are of course old standbys that have been around since the invention of inventions.They work . Most important at 98 cents it is a no brainer .	1
Perfect as needed	1
These are great for the price . None have given me a problem yet . I recommend them over the more expensive ones .	1
What can you say about binder clips ? These work fine as do the other sizes . I do n't know if they are prone to rust , but for paper they 're fine .	1
These are well made and strong , we use these often , they do seem to get lost though because everyone likes them	1
Very reasonable metal binder clips . Stong hardy build quality and they also have a strong grip to them . Good price too .	1
These clips are very sturdy . At this price , you can use them to seal snack bags , hold thick stacks of papers together , match up the socks , etc . Everyone should have these .	1
I 've been using these things for decades and in all of its sizes . They 're far superior to the conventional paper clip ( unless you need absolutely flat storage ) and last just about forever . My wife even uses them to stabilize her bird feeders on a wire line . They do rust if you use them like she does .	1

These were a lot cheaper at Amazon than OfficeMax . Great heavy duty binder clips that you can use for almost anything including in the workshop or in the kitchen .	1
Not much to report about these binder clips except to say that they work , they have n't broken and I have n't come across any defective ones . I use mine to keep bags of flour closed .	1
Have n't used them yet but they look neat & looks like they will do the job to hold my large college essays together in case a professor does n't like stapled essays . Oh ! and these would also be great to bind my index cards for studying !	1
These are a good value and are of good quality . Work great for quantities of paper that are just a bit much for the average staple to comfortably hold or for papers that need to be separated frequently .	1
These clips are made of good metal and can bind large stacks of paper . They are handy and easy to use . You never know when you will need to use one so I stocked up .	1
I mean , what can you write about these ? They are binder clips . Not much more else to add . They bind . They last forever . It takes a long time to rust . These are the extra large ones and I got them to seal packages in the freezer and to hold paper blinds closed .	1
I received the correct number of boxes of clips as stated in the product review . Excellent value for the price .	1
These are the standard large paper clips the office supply stores carry . A great deal for a pack of 10 ... will last me for some time and I wo n't have to be collecting my clips back when I deliver papers anymore !	1
acco is very reliable brand and we love the jumbo size paperclipsour office does not like the small paperclips - papers tend to get disconnectedthese are the best !	1
Its a paperclip , yay , it works as described . But I find Costco to be a bit more competitive in pricing ( online ) .	1
We all need lots of paper clips if we write . If we do taxes . And , staples , while they have their place , just do n't make it where a jumbo paper clip can clasp in its jumboness the sheaf of our thoughts or the checks of a bygone year . Paperclips are like paisleys . We all need more of them .	1
Paper slips ar all the same in my opinion . So just went for the cheapest . Even cheaper on smazon than walmart or Costco .	1
We use to use the small paper clips & found they accidentally clip to other papers that should not be attached . With this size , it is less likely .	1
I bought these about a year ago , use a lot of paperclips ( albeit I reuse them ) and am only on box 2 . You have a better chance of losing them than using all of them . Great value .	1
These are amazing ! How clever that someone devised a way to bend thin strips of shiny metal in such a fashion that they can be used to clip several sheets of paper products together so they do n't get lost . They do n't work as well as my stapler , but those with commitment issues will find the paper clip a great alternative . They can also be bent into fun shapes when you are faced with idle time sitting at your desk . However , it seems that once they are altered from their original shape , they do not perform their intended task very well anymore . Sure glad that I purchased 1,000 of these little buggers .	1
Great , Great easy to use packaging . Bubble wrap comes straight out of the box just like silver foil or wax paper . It 's a very large roll that comes out of a side slot that makes it very easy to cut with your scissor . Meanwhile , the unused portion stays neatly in the box .	1
I use this bubble wrap to protect smaller items that I ship all over the country . The 12 ' width and the perforations every foot make it easy to detach each piece if necessary without having to use scissors or a knife . The smaller bubble size is more adaptable to smaller items .	1
So , I wo n't . I can , however , get excited about the value you 'll get on Amazon.If you need bubble wrap for shipping at a good price , this is a good deal.Note : Most bubble wrapping will stick to your shipped product if you 're sending it across state/country in 100+ degree weather , the product material is susceptible to it ( glossy book cover , plastics , etc . ) and the barrier between the wrapping and the outside of the shipping container is minimal in thickness . Be aware of this and cover your product with something prior to applying the bubble wrap to ensure your product wo n't stick to it ( i.e . a single layer of wrapping tissue around the product )	1
I bought this particular bubble wrap for two reasons : I wanted a good quality bubble wrap and I wanted a larger quantity . I got both with this wrap . It tears every 12 '' if needed and the 100 feet box goes far . I got tired of buying the smaller size bags of bubble wrap and only being able to wrap a few small items before the bag was empty . Not a problem with this size . I 'll buy this bubble wrap again .	1
Scotch pretty much makes the best packing materials there are . This bubble wrap is no different . Good perforation , great price , and good quality . Not really much more to ask for , it 's just bubble wrap . : )	1
What 's better than lots of bubble wrap to dance on ( or wrap produces for shipping ) ? Bubble wrap in neatly perforated squares ! Very customizable to meet any safe-shipping need we 've encountered thus far .	1
I purchased 2 of these for my recent cross-country move to protect my kitchen-wares and fragile stuff ( e.g . lamps , picture frames , a porcelain owl , etc. ) . I did not lose any dishes , cups , bowls , and other fragile items during the move I 'm sure in part thanks to the Scotch Cushion Wrap . The perforations 12 inches help make it easy to tear proper lengths of bubble wrap and you can easily fold or stack them back up for re-use . I have no complaints and will probably buy again for my next move .	1
The cardboard box conveniently doubles as a dispenser , which makes this product even easier to both use and store . The plastic is perforated approx every 12 inches so you can tear off as much as required . Excellent for wrapping .	1
I 'm ordering another one of these : the bubble-wrap is of high quality , and the mailing box kept it that way . It 's worth it to me to pay just a bit more to get a reliable product .	1
This bubble wrap is quite a bargain , especially compared to what it costs at a local office supply store . Even though the bubble wrap is in a box , that box is placed in a larger box for shipping ... it 's like Amazon is throwing in a box for free ! I always buy perforated bubble wrap now - it reduces the time to it takes to wrap items . I occasionally sell things via online auction just to make a few dollars , not as a living . The less time I spend wrapping goods the better.As a bonus , even though the bubbles are smaller they still make a satisfying popping sound ... bubble wrap is n't just for shipping things , it 's for stress relief too ! Buy this - free shipping + free box + made in the USA = a great value .	1
It was important that I receive this fast because I was going to move fast . It arrived in the scheduled time frame . Quality bubble wrap , worked well for protecting my stuff during shipment ... but ... not much can stop UPS and the way they throw around your packages like a sport . They still managed to break some things somehow . The next time I moved I had a UPS store pack my stuff for me , paid them and everything . Bought their bubble wrap and box based on their recommendations and paid for the shipping . They STILL broke my stuff even more , including completely damaging my EVGA GTX 285 . It was a huge hassle to get money out of them for their mistake , they kept trying to blame me despite the fact they were paid to pack and ship it and I had insured it . That 's right ! no bubble wrap can save you from UPS , but this is good quality bubble wrap .	1
Strong , flexible , and perforated so one may use only a 12 '' square or a much longer piece , as needed . Good price compared to most retail stores . Keeps things safe , neat , and tidy while stored away or shipped off .	1
Its hard to get excited or wax poetic about bubble wrap . This stuff works good and gets the job done , with no breakages of the things I have wrapped in it . That 's about all I can say .	1
I love packing with bubble wrap . I always save items that I receive in the mail which has it and reuse it.I bought this large roll as I was running out of my scraps so now I have bubble wrap to last for years . : - )	1
These are great for little gift tags . They are perfect for small gifts and some pretty twine ! Happy with these .	1
paper tag key rings can be written on and stored easily . great if you have extra keys you need to organize	1
Wow , what do you even say about key tags . If you need to label keys these are a good option . Great price and they were exactly what I expected .	1
These little things are so handy for labeling keys , thanks so much ! I thought the price was good for how many were in the box .	1
Perfect . They were just what I wanted . Excellent quality . I shopped around for these locally and the pricing was terrible . So expensive . The pricing here was very good and fair for what I wanted to pay . This single pack will last for a long time , too .	1
So many places are carrying the new plastic hook-type key tags for cabinets , it was great I found these at Amazon . I realize it is n't a big deal -- unless your co-workers need them .	1
I use them daily before they are needed for a torn hole . I print out a lot of recipes making a cookbook . great for extra protection .	1
This simple dispenser for hole reinforcements works great , peeling one reinforcement at a time off the backing tape as you gently pull it out of the dispenser box . Very nice .	1
TRYING TO LOCATE REINFORCEMENTS IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS IS NOT ALWAYS EASY . PAGES ARE OFTEN IN NEED OF REPAIR . REINFORCEMENTS TO THE RESCUE .	1
What can I say about hole reinforcements other than they work well . Nothing tears once they 're on and they stick well without coming off .	1
I know in this day and age it is easier to just make another copy if the holes blow out but I like my originals so I use these to repair them .	1
Not much can be said about hole reinforcements but I can say that this brand is one that I stick by and the product does what it should at a reasonable price . Mainly I like the convenience of having it delivered .	1
A super product ! They adhere very well and very thin . I use these frequently and I highly recommend this product .	1
These ring-hole protector is really easy to use , it attached firmly on the paper , and make sure your notes will never ever try to run away from your	1
one off those things it 's good to have around . we keep them near the desk . they last a long time .	1
I bought these because the first little box I bought were clear and you cant see them . Its infuriating trying to pick those little invisible sticky circles off the paper . Enter these white ones ... just the ticket !	1
I ca n't get over just how `` real '' these cards look , even when using a standard inkjet printer . There is NO telltale rough/perforated edge , and the matte ivory looks classier than standard white cards if you 're looking for an `` executive '' feel to your cards.I downloaded Avery 's own `` DesignPro '' program ( free -- and idiot-proof ) , which makes it ridiculously simple to design and print your cards . The best thing about this is that even though the bargain business-card company many of us use ( you know which one ) does a terrific job for a good price , you do n't always need 200 cards and you ca n't always wait . For instance , if you have a new employee and a conference/tradeshow/meeting in a couple of days , it 's easy to knock off a few dozen cards in an instant so he/she can do business right away.Ca n't recommend these highly enough .	1
I 'm actually a travel agent , and I purchased these to use in plastic luggage tags that I give to my clients . They work just fine . I do find that the edges look a little better than other brands that I 've tried , though because of the way I use them , that 's not as much of an issue for me , it certainly would be if you 're actually using them as your business card . On other brands , you will sometimes see a little `` fiber '' around the card , and you do n't see that with these .	1
I use these to print membership cards and am impressed with the quality . They 're the perfect thickness , and the break apart very cleanly . Professional-looking cards at a good price . Great for what I needed .	1
Works wonderful and clean separations . Very nice for the price and the great buy period . Thank you for the great product .	1
I was surprised how cleanly these cards separate . You get ten business cards per sheet . As soon as you are done printing , you just fold each crease inward ( with the front side facing you ) , and *snap* , the cards separate very cleanly , leaving a very clean edge . There is no rough perforation left at all.Designing your cards is pretty easy if you are comfortable with MS Word or OpenOffice . I was able to create double sided , full bleed business cards in OpenOffice with a reasonable amount of effort.Pros : - Nice , thick , bright card stock.- Very clean edges.- Very easy to separate cards ( they literally snap apart with little effort ) .- Affordable way to do short runs of color business cards.- You can download Word templates online easily ( login required ) .- Double side layouts are easy , just create another document with the template , flip over your page , and print.- Good ink adhesion with my Canon ink jet . No smearing , quick drying.Cons : - This pack only comes with eight sheets . This leaves little room for practice runs for your layout . I recommend printing just one card per try until you get it right . This means you 'll print into the upper left card the first time , then have to edit your document to use the next square ( so you can reuse the same sheet ) .- Not the best solution for large quantities -- but this is pretty obvious .	1
The AVERY WHITE CLEAN EDGE BUSINESS CARDS are great ! They 're come in 8.5 '' X 11 '' heavy-duty card stock sheets ( 10 cards per sheet ) and they come apart cleanly with no perforations or jagged edges.And they 're very easy to design . You can either create your own business card from scratch or use one of the pre-designed cards that you can find online at Avery 's website.If you do n't have an Internet connection you must have MS WORD to access the Avery Template for the business cards ( in MS WORD 2007 the template # is 28877 and it 's the same thing -- but you can download the current one # 28878 ) . Unless you are well versed in MS WORD or making a simple business card with name , address , phone number and email address info only , using WORD can be a little tricky.There 's an information sheet that explains how to access the template in MS WORD , which is pretty simple and bare bones , so even if you do n't know how to use the program , you 'll still be able to get to the template itself.If you do n't have MS WORD or access to an Internet connection then you 'll have to call customer service . Maybe in the future Avery could include a CD , with the templates on it , so that you can just copy them on to your computer.Hopefully you 've got an Internet connection because going online to Avery 's site is the best bet and makes creating the cards a snap ! The Avery site has all these options and for free . You have to register in order to access the good stuff but they only ask for name and email address and you can opt out of getting email notices from them . Anyway here 's what 's on the site : ***Pre-Designed and Blank templates for Mac & Window users which can be downloaded . ***You can customize and design the business cards on the site without needing MS WORD or other program . There 's a design wizard that guides you through the entire process and you can save the design on your computer and print right from the site . ***Different fonts are available online and there 's also illustrations and stock photos that you can use in your design . ***Step-by-step directions on printing the cards and what to do to align your printer if need be.I tried both methods to create my business cards and by far the online version was easiest . From start to finish the process was simple and user friendly . I printed the cards up and only had to adjust the alignment a little.This great product should help save money on pro-business cards and might bring calling cards back in style ( OK , maybe not-lol ) .	1
While I normally have my professional cards printed professionally in larger amounts , I enjoy being able to occasionally print up a few `` specific '' business cards , and I always keep a few around to use.So , when I was given the chance to try this particular card - the new Clean-Edge cards , I was excited.The cards say they are for `` inkjet printers '' and I know that the heat and pass-through path can be a problem on laser printers , but I thought I 'd try using the laser as well . I used the bypass , and it went through perfectly . I folded the sheet forward ( as it instructed ) and the cards `` popped '' out easily . They came out with clean edges - I could neither see nor feel any roughness whatsoever . While not as heavy as my professionally printed cards , they are well within the range.I also passed them through my inkjet to make sure there was no problem . They printed easily on both sides . Having them capable of being printed on the back side gives a lot more flexibility to the product ! Avery 's Design pro is a free download , and since I alternate between Windows and Mac , I normally use this program to set up my cards and labels . It worked very well for this product as it has in the past . I used the 8878 template , but the cards indicate that the 8371 will work as well.I use business cards for many projects - including reminders , memorization cards ( these are just the right size to keep handy ) making my own personalized gift tags for Christmas ( I just punch a hole in the corner , and little notes of encouragement when visiting sick friends . These are the nicest ones I have found to date . ***Edit***I ended up using the rest of these to make business cards for a friend who does hairdressing and who needed some . It was nice to be able to customize them using her logo . However , when I was working on them , I remembered one `` old fashioned tip '' for doing double sided on a printer.Put a piece of paper in your printer . Mark it up / down / towards front / towards bottom . Run the Paper through with a document Marked PRINT or some variation . Then , keep the paper handy . Use it to help make sure your documents go through correctly ! The most frustrating part of two-sided is trying to figure these details out !	1
I 've used print at home business cards before , and they always left a rough edge . There was no way around it- you could tell you printed them at home . I have to say however , that these `` Clean Edge '' business cards are a vast improvement on the past ! To a trained eye , you can still see the edge was that of a tear-away , but they look pretty darn good ! I would n't be embarrassed to pass these out , as I was with the older versions .	1
It 's very easy to use , and the paper quality is great , which makes it very professional looking . Also , both sides are made for prints.It 's also great for making little cards , such as seating , little card on the gift item , etc . It 's very useful !	1
If you want to have a card for all occassions , it 's easy - just get these Business cards and you can make up as many as you need , with whatever design you want ... These cards allow me a flexibility that vista cards do not , so I can change them subtly if I need to . They also print easily and do n't smudge , and break apart cleanly . The final product looks completely professional.That being said , if you need 500 identical cards , I would go to a professional printer . But if you only need small amounts and things change as you go , then these are a terrific option . Happy to use them and would buy again .	1
Very easy to use once you figure out how to pop them out . It took me a couple sheets of practice to get the hang of it . Convenient for small events where you do n't need too many cards or if you like to do them as needed . The software was a bit confusing to use and the graphics did n't align correctly with the first sheet . Had to tweak the formatting to get it lined up . Overall very nice .	1
These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards , rather than paying out for someone else to do them . As long as you have a good printer , they work very well . The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time . You ca n't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples . If you do , you 'll ruin at least one sheet of cards . It 's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet , click print , wait . Load a sheet , click print , wait . Other than that , I have no complaints .	1
These blank cards gave me a clean sharp edge and did n't jam my printer . I use them for personal printed notes as well as my business cards , and I think Avery has some of the most reliableproducts on the market .	1
I thought when I received this I was going to get the same old DIY , perforated business cards that look so incredibly awful and do n't pass the mustard in anyone 's world . So when these came and had that super clean edge I was very glad it actually was what it said it was going to be . My only issue is with the thickness of the cardstock . It 's not really that `` buy a box of business cards at a print shop '' type quality , but for a student just out of college or someone looking to grow their small business , I think this is an excellent project . Not high quality enough for executives , but definitely a nice product for everyone else . Also , it 's a matte finish , not the typical glossy . I was also impressed by the Avery website that helped me create my design : I was able to upload my own .pdf logo and delete all their wordage and basically create my own . They could use a `` Blank '' format on their website , but I deleted one of their designs easily enough then made my own . It let me save my design as a .pdf document so I can go back and print more anytime . Printing is easy with the arrows they provide , and rethread it through to print the second side . 10 cards to a page , so a total or 8 sheets in a package . All in all , I like this product for it 's clear instructions and ability to save my own design on my hard drive . I wish it had thicker cardstock .	1
These are great cards . They print out very nicely give directional arrows to indicate which way the paper is fed and the snap out edges make them very easy to use .	1
I frequently use Avery paper because of the consistently high quality , and these business card sheets did not disappoint . The print quality is excellent and smudge free , ran easily through my printer and are easily separated without the `` cheap '' looking perforated edges that are prevalent on some other brands of cards.These sheets are smooth and bright white and hassle free ! I would recommend these to anyone who print their own cards at home , specially full color cards !	1
These card blanks were just the ticket to quickly create inexpensive business cards on the fly.The paper is not the thickest you can see in cards , but it is quite adequate . Lining everything up in the printer is also a snap .	1
Avery Clean- Edge Business Cards are designed to produce professional- looking business cards directly from your home office printer . I wear several different hats throughout the week and I have separate business cards for my many different occupations . Some of my business cards are ordered online , but others , I design and print myself . Avery Clean- Edge Business cards have proven to be a good business card for this purpose.So , what are the advantages with Avery Clean Edge Business Cards ? The quality I noticed first was the easy separation of the cards after printing . You bend the cards and they snap apart with ease . It is amazing how they hold themselves together so well during handling and printing , yet they snap apart so easily . I also like that the ink dries quickly and does n't smear . And , of course , it is nice to have a product like this handy when you need business cards quickly and do n't have the time to wait for an order to arrive in the mail.On the negative side , these business cards are quite thin . Other consumers have noticed and stated the same thing , and it is very true . They are more like a piece of heavyweight paper than a card , and this is something to consider if you contemplate making a purchase . Also , I have found that the printing works best if I feed one sheet at a time through my printer . If I place two or more sheets in the feeder and print , there is a good chance the print one the second , third , etc. , sheets will gradually slide down . This does n't happen if the sheets are fed individually and , in fact , this is exactly what Avery recommends . Some printers may work fine with multiple sheets fed at once , but to play it safe , feed only one at a time.Business cards are a necessity and Avery Clean- Edge Business Cards are a good product to have on hand when you want to make business cards or some other item . The cost per card works out to about eleven or twelve cents each , which is n't necessarily cheap , but the cards offer the convenience of in- home printing and thus the price is n't too bad . Add to that the clean breaking action and the lack of any smearing and you have a good business card for general use .	1
Avery is now offering on-line templates where you do all your data entry and design through their web site at [ ... ] . It 's easy to get to , just enter the product number ( 28878 ) under the `` Create by Product '' section.There are a ton of designs to choose from all organized by topic , although I was looking for a design for a bike shop and there really was n't a lot that trilled me under the sports section . It will be nice if Avery adds along more designs and perhaps a search engine to find by specific topic.I do however like the `` Create by Product '' interface . It is easy to use wizard/interface and you can add your own graphics and photos if you like . If you save the project , you save as a dot avery ( .avery ) file format or by printing it creates a PDF that you can save to your computer for easy re-prints ( without changes ) .You can still download a blank template or pre-designs ( 23 designs ) to use in MS-Word which is still my preference since the document will reside on my computer where I know it 's safe and I can change or make updates anytime.I especially like the product because it really leaves a clean edge almost like a professionally printed business card . The paper quality is good ( although I would like it if it was a bit thicker ) and it tears apart really easily .	1
Need new business cards fast ? Do n't want to pay for rush printing and shipping ? Then these cards could just be what you need.I had no problems setting up the cards to print . Of course , as always , there are a couple of things you should keep in mind:1 . ) Do not tear the cards apart when you are done . `` Snap '' them apart by bending them toward you.2 . ) Place one sheet in your printer at a time.Yes , these tips are printed right there in the instructions . But looking through the 1 and 2 Star reviews on Amazon , I think a few people missed those helpful tidbits before they wasted paper and ink.Of course , I did n't need the whole 80 for my emergency card run . Now my son gets some nifty new Math Facts flash cards !	1
Avery Clean Edge Business Cards - # 28878These business card blanks are designed specifically for use with an ink jet printer . Each sheet contains ten standard size 2 '' x 3.5 '' cards - eight sheets to a package ( 80 cards total ) . The sheets can be printed on both sides if required . The paper stock is a nice , heavy weight and the individual cards feel appropriately thick with a good solid feel . Avery 's Clean Edge feature allows the finished cards to literally `` snap '' apart by bending the sheets backward . The resulting cards have no perforations and the edges are totally clean - impossible to tell your own printed cards from ones that are professionally prepared.Avery has Word templates available for download or by going to [ ... ] it is possible to design your cards with the help of their Avery Design site . I prefer to design my own cards with graphics apps , but having this service available as a no-cost option will be helpful to some.This is an excellent quality product - highly recommended .	1
There really is n't anything very complicated about hand made business cards . I 've never found a paper that gives the cards the same look as a professionally printed card , and this paper is no different . ( I do give room for the possibility that the look of the cards is more the fault of my printer or my design ability . ) The snap-break does give the cards a cleaner look than a perforated card would give , but in the end , they still look like something you printed at home from your computer . The cards look great and the instructions are simple , but if I 'm looking for new business cards , I 'm going to go one of two ways . Either I 'm going to order them from a professional company or I 'm going to make them at home with a cheaper paper . With so many online companies offering professional cards at such low prices , I wonder if there is any real market for products like this .	1
These cards are fairly easy to use and nice quality ( thick and smooth , nice bright white ) . You *will* have to work with templates in your software , which is always a little bit of a hassle , and sometimes you have to print out a few `` test cards '' to make sure that it all lines up and looks the way you like . If your printer is temperamental , like our printers are , you will also have to feed each sheet individually and wait for the printing process to complete . If you have an hour or so of spare time , and are fairly adept at using your word processing software , this product should be a breeze to work with.However , in this day and age , there are several online sites that offer free ( or very close to it- under $ 10 ) professionally made cards , complete with glossy finish or embossing . After years and years or doing my own business cards with Avery products , I finally gave in and gave one of these sites a whirl and was very pleased with the quality of the cards and would NEVER go back to doing my own . Google `` free business cards '' for information.If you need to print small quantities of cards , or frequently need to change the information on your cards , doing it yourself is the way to go , and Avery products are the best you can get .	1
I make handcrafted pens from exotic woods and sell them at craft shows . I have a card made up for each kind of wood that I use and give it with the pen when I sell them . I only have 27 different flavors of woods and 10 different styles of pens , each with its own care card . Add to that my own card and that makes a lot of cards to be printing and cutting ! I 've been doing the cards the hard way and printing them on card stock and then cutting them out . With these its so much easier ! The only thing about them is that sometimes they dont separate clean . Sometimes the cards do n't come apart clean and it pulls up a little feather of paper on the edge ruining that card . That 's why I only gave them four stars . Now if I can get them in different colors I 'll never use card stock for them again !	1
The best way to go with these business cards is to download the free Avery Design Pro software . Using this program , one can create a wide variety of business cards to satisfy virtually anyone.These cards do have a matte finish which is more conservative in appearance than the glossy or semi-glossy stock that is also available from Avery . They take color nicely and look very professional with their smooth edge.The cards break loose easily and dry quickly . It is usually wise to let them sit for a few minutes before stacking them.I am very pleased with the business cards that have been produced from this product and can recommend them to anyone wanting to exercise creativity in the design of their business cards .	1
These make easy and fast business cards , however they seem to lack the true professional look of real ink on a gloss card . A business card is important for impression of your business , therefore I would prefer the professional route that ink jet just can not give.They are easy to set up and use . If you are sending trial balloons with your card these might do .	1
I have tried printable business cards in the past , but you could always tell by looking closely or running a finger across the edge that they had perforations . This version is smooth and requires a _very_ close look to tell that they were once part of a sheet.Avery offers a design utility online with standard examples modifiable for personal needs ( including alternate images ) , that will download a PDF file to your computer for printing ( remember to set Scaling to None to get everything lined up properly , I wasted one sheet through that error ) . The result ( considering your design ) is a fairly professional business card on matte stock.Pros : great for limited run cards ( less that the usual 100 minimum required by printers ) , multi-color without the extra cost , smooth edges , easy separation.Cons : unlike labels you need to print a whole sheet before using any ( no one off runs of cards here ) , thinner stock than most business cards I have had professionally printed , the printing is not raised like on cards I have had professionally printed , not really less expensive than professional printers unless you really do not need 100.Bottom line , even with the above negatives , I still feel this product deserves 5 stars because it does exactly what it should do , provide a professional quality business card ( your results may vary ) that I will not hesitate to hand out to prospective employers ( something I will be doing this coming Friday when looking for intern positions ) .P- )	1
These business cards are heavy , bright white , and truly look unperforated when `` clicked '' apart . They should take ink very well , and you 'll be able to make some decent-looking cards with them if you know what you are doing . Avery provides assistance with a number of templates , or you can design them yourself if you 're good with graphic design and typography.I was a bit disappointed when my box of cards arrived for review , however , because one side had been crushed in shipping . The two-sided printing feature was what I was most interested in testing with these cards , because I often need to custom-print a few `` mini-brochure '' business cards in addition to my regular two-sided , four-color cards . There was no way those crumpled sheets were going to go through my printer without jamming , so I decided to use them to make business card holders for small table signs . ( Search the Instructables site for `` Simple business card iPhone / iPod stand . '' ) They are stiff enough for that purpose , so I 'll get good use from them . And I 'll buy them in the future , too , when I need custom business cards because they are a quite handy product .	1
I had to admit that when I ordered these I was skeptical because I am such a computer illiterate . I figured that I would never be able to work this product or if I could , the cards would come out looking like crud . But boy , was I pleasantly surprised ! Not only were the instructions clear and easy to follow , but they were so self-explanatory that I could n't have messed up on them even if I wanted to ! There are lots of interesting designs , backgrounds , boarders , holiday themes and clip-art to chose from . Many of the popular professions are represented too . I tried both the templates that come with the cards AND doing some using my own logo and art work . Both were easy to work with and for a do-it-yourself project I was fairly impressed by the quality . There are enough fonts to make your cards unique too . Being able to print on both sides of the card allowed me to add more information about my web-site than I normally could have.The printing was crisp for the type of printer I use ( Epson scanner/printer - very inexpensive ) , there was no smudging of the ink.It will take some experimenting to get perfect results , but it 's well worth your time and effort.No these of course these are n't the quality of expensive custom print cards that you have to order and pay an arm and a leg for ... but for someone just starting out like me , they serve a very important purpose and they are well within my budget . Plus I love the idea of changing my cards to suit the Holiday or my whims . The ease in which they break apart is fabulous and when they say clean edge they really mean it .	1
These work wonders when you need a short run of 10-50 cards before a meeting or trade show . They can pay for themselves if you get creative and use any overprints for raffles and free lunch drawings . The clean edges are a plus on these - some other inject printer cards look awful because of their perforated edges . I 'd give them 5 stars if they were a little cheaper .	1
These blank cards work hand-in-glove with design templates that you download for free from Avery 's website . Those templates are easy to use and intuitive . They do not allow as many tweaks as high-end design programs , but then there is no steep learning curve either . Perfectly sufficient to produce a small run of business cards in a pinch.The matte paper is much better than glossy for business cards . I compared them by printing on both , and the matte paper helped hide small imperfections of imported graphics , while the glossy clearly exposed them.The sheets are very well produced , and after you break them into cards , the edges are surprisingly smooth.This is a good product that does the job as advertised !	1
It 's been a while since I had last attempted to print my own business cards , and the memories of those times did not make me overly optimistic about the viability of the whole do-it-yourself approach to business cards . These always looked jagged on the edges , printed on a poor quality paper with the print quality that screamed cheap home printer . However , Avery cards turned to be quite something else . The Clean Edge turned out to be just that - almost completely smooth edges on par with the professionally printed cards . The paper too is thick and of high quality.The business card templates that are downloadable from the Avery website , however , did not impress me all that much . Most of them are rather plane looking , and the selection is very meager . The templates that can be used online were not very intuitive in terms of how they need to be used , and I never got too far with them . The website also provides a downloadable card design program that supposedly works with MS Word . The program is rather large ( 134 MB ) , and comes with no instructions on how to use it . The program seems to have installed correctly on my computer , but I was unable to access any of its features from MS Word.Overall , these are remarkably well done blank printable business cards , and if used with a laser printer will provide almost professional-quality results . However , if you are more particular about how you want to design your business cards , you might want to try some other solution .	1
These are wonderful . They go thru clean and the edges tear well . As long as you use them according to the directions , these look almost like you had them done professionally . They can be used on laser , but are specifically designed for ink jet , which accepts ink differently .	1
Avery was n't kidding when they named these business cards Clean Edge . They really break off with clean edges and it 's so easy , too . The quality of the paper is superb and I printed with an ordinary inkjet printer and there were no smears or streaks . The sheet will tell you how to load in the paper and how to break off the cards . They also include instructions on how to download free software from Avery and the website also has a lot of templates for business cards and other projects . Avery is really awesome for business and creative needs !	1
I used this Avery business card paper to make name cards for my side business . Since it is just a casual side business , I do n't need the most elaborate business card in the world , but I do need to look professional . These worked out very well . Most computers and printers support Avery configurations , and once I had my file , it was very simple to print sharp looking business cards . The paper is lined with a crisp plastic that separates neatly and gives the card a nice weight and feel . The micro-small perforations do n't leave an edge that would be mistaken for print-shop-cut cards , but the soft fuzzy edge is not obtrusive and appears smooth to all but the sharpest of eyes . If you are a graphics designer or something along those lines and need an elaborate color design or full edge-to-edge color print , these cards will probably not be suitable , as the torn edge always leave something to be desired when it has ink on it . But if you are just putting your name , title , contact information , and maybe a small logo or something like that within the normal print margins , these are more than adequate and definitely more professional looking than most business card stock out there . This is a good product that will fit most users ' needs , which is why I give it four stars .	1
I currently have 2 sets of business cards : one professional , and one for my hobby/ alternate business . Because of the nature of my business , I am unlisted and only my office address and professional phone number are on my business cards . My art business : those cards I have some fun with , and am currently having them printed overseas ( from an artist whose work I am using by license ) . Neither provides the information I want to give friends . So , I used these cards to make up some `` calling cards '' . I was a way for me to play with these and see what I could do with them , and how the final product looked . I put this off for quite a bit because I remembered that my templates , design software were on my old computer , and never moved over to the new one . That said , I thought this would be a chore.When I opened the package there were instructions from Avery directing me to their web site ; which provided the option of templates , wizards , or tools for free-form creation . They have several backgrounds available , some clip art and templates suiting a range of purposes . Both the wizard and template provide the option of copying each element ( text , graphics , background ... ) to every card , or varying the designs . You can also import your own graphics or pictures . It provides a broad range of options and a lot of flexibility . Because of all those options , I had a lot of fun.First I ran off a set of alternate business cards : text only ( small logo graphic ) . Then I ran a set with a photographic background ... and then I did a sheet with all different kinds of pictures , graphics ... just to play with it.The whole process was a lot of fun , and I wound up with some nice looking and useful cards.I found the Avery web site and template very intuitive as it uses graphic and image manipulation tools common to a variety of graphics programs . Using the template involved a very short learning curve for me . ( Having used a couple of graphics programs I did not need the wizard , which might be useful to some ) . The site allowed me to save my work in a variety of formats , as well as send to my printer , or order online . They also have downloadable templates compatible with a variety of programs.How did the final product look ? Most of the cards looked very nice . the one which had issues were mostly related to my printer ( or , more likely my ink cartridges , which are not quite up to snuff ) . The only cards I printed which had results that I believe would be equally unsatisfactory on other printers ( or this one with better ink ) were those with full- card photographic backgrounds . On those cards , the amount of ink used resulted in somewhat warped cards . They may well even out as they dry ( or , this can be handled by weighting them , pressing in a book or something similar ) .Am I going to use these to replace my business cards ? On the simple ones , these might well do ( though white cards with plain text do not cost much to print ) . However , these would certainly do in a pinch , and are faster than reordering.For the cards with licensed art ... I can only get those in one place , but for casual use , these are great ! ! ! I had so much fun , I think I 'm going to try a few more of their products ; birthday cards , address labels . I have n't done those things on my computer since I moved to a new machine leaving the pertinent software behind . Now I know I can do it all online at Avery 's site , and that it is free , or has the cost builty in to the compatible product.All in all , I would recommend these for a variety of uses . They are quick , easy , and fun ... .and , I suspect if you are not happy with the results you get on your home printer , that bit can be taken care of by creating and ordering online.Who knew that making business cards could be so much fun ?	1
These are pretty good and much less expensive than going to a printing shop ! I printed off a sheet ... clear and clean ... no smudging ( I feared ) and they look great ! Could hardly tell that I made these and had n't ordered them .	1
At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look `` professional '' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that , in fact , I ca n't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home . The clean cut edge is very smooth . To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting , and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them .	1
I 've used cards like this in the past , which . . .simply put . . . were `` unprofessional '' . They were `` fuzzy '' around the edges . Not so with these ! As it shows in the description , you can use them for many things , and not just business cards . The more you purchase , the better the price .	1
These cards are great ! . Super clean and smooth edges , and really easy to separate . The cards look like they were printed by a professional print shop rather than at home . I use a HP Officejet , and they worked great with it . I recommend them without reservations !	1
If you have a good printer , the sheets are great for making business cards and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the cards pop out . Unfortunately , my printer does not detect the sheets as feed and tends to do funky things , so it is recommended to do a lot of tests and planning before printing.I also had an issue with Staples selling a defective product ( the paper was rough and looked used ) and Avery customer service was very responsive . They sent another pack over , which worked fine , and I bought a huge pack from Amazon because I loved it so much !	1
The heavy , stiff paper used for these is very smooth and bright white for crisp , clear , text and high res . photos , and logos , and other graphic arts . These are some of the best quality inkjet printable perforated business cards I have ever felt . Usually they 're much less stiff and crisp . These are very nearly top professional business card quality.And the new feature of smooth edges is very nice also . Most perforated business cards have obvious perf edges . These have good edges . Yay .	1
This kit produces very nice looking cards . They are , as the name states , clean edged , so they do n't look so obviously like you printed them at home . They are basic smooth white cards - no special embossed textured look . If clean white crisp cards are what you need - these will fit the bill nicely . I can recommend these for home and SOHO use unreservedly .	1
The Avery Clean Edge Business Cards are a good alternative to professionally printed business cards if you have a limited budget and need business cards immediately for a meeting or networking event . As long as you 're using a good inkjet or laser printer and you take your time to design a good business card then the Avery Clean Edge cards work great.If you look closely you can tell these are n't the same quality as professionally printed cards , so if your schedule and budget allows you really should order cards from one of the dozens of online business card services , but when you 're in a pinch these cards get the job done.My wife recently used these Avery Clean Edge cards at a business presentation where she had to unveil the staging/demo site for a new website . She printed the company logo and the staging site URL on these cards and gave them to everyone at the meeting so they could visit the staging site at their leisure and email follow-up questions to her after the presentation . I think that was the best use of these Avery cards thus far.Bottom line : the Avery Clean Edge Business Cards are fine if you 're tight on cash and need business cards fast , but they do n't quite match the quality of professionally printed business cards .	1
I have used other business card forms for printing custom made business cards . The results were acceptable , but you could tell that the cards were part of a larger sheet from the rough edges.Avery has raised the bar for print it yourself business cards . They provide templates on their web site [ ... ] and now offer these Clean Edge Business Card forms ( 28878 ) . As the name implies , the cards snap apart cleanly after printing so you get more professional results.In today 's job market you need an `` edge '' over the competition to `` separate '' you from the crowd . These cards can help .	1
I wanted to make business cards at home , that looked and felt good , and that would allow a great color photo picture to be used on the card with my information . I have usedAvery Linen-Textured Two-Side Clean Edge Business Cards for Inkjet Printers , Matte , White , Pack of 200 ( 08873 ) - and after working with templates and WORD to design my card , I 've been really happy with the results.Then recently , I was given a pack ofAvery Clean Edge Business Cards , 2 inches x 3 1/2 inches , White , 80 Cards ( 28878 ) . These are like the ones that I have been using , but without the Linen-Texture . These indicate that they are for Ink-Jets ( but do work in Laser printers , or at least they work in the HP 1600 Color Laser printer that I have ) . The instructions suggest that you remove all of the paper from your printer , and feed these in one at a time . I 've done it that way , and I 've told my printer that I am printing a heavier card-stock type paper , and in all cases , I 've been happy ( no jams ) .The laser perforated edges on all four sides of the cards snap away cleanly . You do n't rip or cut or tear these cards apart , you print them , and snap them apart . This worked much better than I would have imagined . You can not see the that these were snapped apart - the final product looks great.If you need 500 cards , then making them at home might not be the most costly solution , but for a few dozen specialty cards , these work great .	1
I was very impressed with the quality of these cards . They print well and easily , even on my old Canon S630 inkjet , break apart easily , leave very clean edges , and can be printed on both sides.I used a whole pack testing , and did not have a single problem , paper jam , or misprint . The paper holds the ink nicely , and is of a high quality . The edges of the cards are far more smooth than earlier Avery stock , and there are no rough spots or hanging bits of fiber after separating the cards.While there are those who advise against printing your own cards instead of having them professionally printed , I would say that the flexibility and functionality of using these cards far outweighs any negative . Anyone who judges a person based on whether they have professionally printed business cards or not will be easily misled anyway . Best to avoid doing business with someone like that.Although you can print on both sides , I did n't try that.I recommend these and will use them again myself .	1
Avery Clean Edge Business Cards , 2 inches x 3 1/2 inches , White , 80 Cards ( 28878 ) The perfect Rockford Kit . That dates me , remember The Rockford Files ? Jim Rockford would always have a different business card for every situation . Well with these and your ink jet printer , you 're set.You get three ways to design your master piece . A website , a program and a Microsoft Word plugin . All are free and available for download at the indicated Avery webpage . I used the Word plugin . It added a menu choice to the toolbar ribbon in Word 2007 . From there a mini program pops up and lets you use a template or design from scratch with an advanced set of tools . When you 're happy with your masterpiece , it pops it into Word all formatted and ready to print . When I printed to my HP C7250 ( C7280 ) all I did was choose the best print quality . Out came some beautiful cards . I followed the directions for snapping them apart and they sure did . They were clean and well centered . I had no issues with printing alignment . I followed the directions to only put one sheet on the tray and no other paper . It worked perfectly . Only a printer ( person not machine ) is going to tell these are n't professionally done . The edge is quite smooth and the ink is sharp and clean . No smearing either.Very highly recommended if you need just a few for a special occasion or event . If you need hundreds you may want to go pro . A very good product .	1
These are the best you will be able to get at home . On the plus side , you have infinate customization , colors and graphics without any added cost . On the downside you have to do it yourself and there is no embossed lettering . If you need basic business cards , these will pass muster just fine . Nevertheless , remember that some of the best business cards are very basic with no graphics and a nice font . If all you want is a basic one color text only card , you will probably do better at an office supply store.You need MS Word and an internet connection to download the template.The card stock is average - nothing American Psycho special . The perforations do n't really show unless you are looking for them very carefully .	1
It seems that the people from Avery have gone out of their way to make it impossible for you to dislike this product.The product itself is not very new or noteworthy in its basic form . These sorts of cards are very useful for a variety of reasons . The most ingenious use I have seen of this sort of card was from a soccer mom , who gave them to all the other children on the team at the end of the season . On the card , it had her daughter 's name , their phone number , and a message that went a little like this : `` Bonnie would love to play with you in the near future '' . A flat magnet was glued to the back , for fridge use.This is just one possible use for these , and I feel that everyone has the need for these cards at some time or another : I.C.E . card for wallet , business card , mini-invite , RSVP card , you name it ... So why THIS card ? Here is the breakdown.First , the perf'ed edges have come a long way , baby . I can remember that back in the day , you might feel sheepish about handing someone an obviously perf-torn edged card . Now , these cards are n't going to have a sharp edge , like a professionally made card , they will have a soft edge . But , I think the recipient is much more likely to critique your card design than the card construction . Hats off to Avery for getting this down , its really quite good.Second , there are no less than FOUR count 'm FOUR ways to print these cards . You can do it through [ ... ] without any download , for example , which is the most impressive . Running lindows ? Red Hat ? Well , if the browser you are using is n't completely whack , there is a fair chance you are going to be able to print these cards . And if you ca n't , well , its not Avery 's fault . But the vast majority of us who are running IE and Windows will be happy that they do n't have to install/configure Word to get the job done . Then you have the MS Word , option , which is ok but Word is n't free . Then there is another Word option , and finally Avery DesignPro . Which I did n't use , but I suspect its free , although it requires you to install software ( PC/Mac ) .Third , these cards can be printed on both sides . Hey , its only 2 x 3.5 '' of real estate so both sides count . For me , its useful to have my business card printed in English on one side , and a foreign language on the other . I doubt thats going to be true for many people , but its a tribute to the flexibility this allows.Overall , I love this because you can print as FEW cards as you need of each kind . If you really needed 80+ card that were all the same , you might want to try some of the online vendors . But , at the time of this writing , these cards are a measly .11 ea ( before the cost of your ink ) and at that rate , I think you simply ca n't go wrong .	1
I must say this is very impressive . I always wanted to have some personal calling cards that had the style and quality of business cards . By downloading the template from Avery for free I was able within minutes to print great cards on my Canon MP610 inkjet printer . The easy and power of the templates was great . I was also worried that the separation of the cards would be either using a paper cutter or the cards would have perforation marks . Nope . The cards literally pop right out of the sheet with perfectly straight edges . This is exactly what I have been looking for . I highly recommend these to anyone who wants an easy way to get low volume , high quality , very customizable cards , be it for personal use like myself or even for business .	1
I love these ! So easy to use ! I am so happy with them . When I run out I have every intention of getting more . The instructions are clear , making this a quick set up . Anytime I need to print some cards , I just open up the file & print the cards . Simple as that . They snap apart really well . I have never had any tear . There is no way I will buy business cards again ! I now have my own artwork , I love my cards & all it costs is the package of cards , some ink & a tiny amount of my time.Highly recommend !	1
IMO Avery continues to dominate the do-it-yourself business advertising market . The quality of the paper is superb - thick enough to not feel homemade , yet not as substantial as a professional business card . It would be nice to see a heavier weight paper offered , with the understanding that some home printers malfunction when the paper weight is too high.The Clean Edge system is where this business card paper really impresses . The edges on these cards are simply amazing . The perforation is so tiny that the edge looks nearly smooth . Other brands tend to leave a ridged edge that has feathery bits of paper jutting out . Also , the fold-back method to separate these cards is terrific . Never does a card edge rip and the process is very fast.Compared to any other brands that I 've tried , these Avery Clean Edge Business Cards are my clear favorite . I have printed 3 packs of cards and will continue to purchase more as needed.My only gripe is that Avery release printer templates for more software than Microsoft Word . In print design , Microsoft Word is at the far bottom . Avery should consider that software from Adobe , Corel , and others have been mainstream for many years and release templates accordingly . It is possible to find Adobe and Corel compatible templates online , however Avery really ought to step up and release official templates on their website .	1
It 's not hard to find other do-it-yourself business card stock out there , but most are pretty lousy . The Avery smooth edge cards are by far been the best I 've used . They are well engineered , easy to break apart , and most importantly have some excellent companion software.I 'm starting a small business and these are the cheapest way for me to get a decent 3 color design output in small enough quantities for our needs . I especially like the downloadable Windows software Avery makes available for free on their website . Design it once , load in multiple names , phone numbers , emails , etc . and you 're in business - literally . Everybody gets their own card and the effort is minimal.Even in the fastest print mode , my printer outputs a quality level with these cards that exceeds budget business card printing services online . The stock is bright white , heavy , and absorbs ink well . My clients are hard pressed to tell the difference between the Avery cards and something that came from a printing company.The cards literally `` snap '' apart , which is actually a fun activity . It 's amazing they hold together as well as they do considering the violence my high speed ink jet subjects them to during the printing process . It is important to follow the directions and load each sheet individually without having additional paper in the feeder . I do experience occasional paper feed issues with my Epson Workforce 600 , but a little coaxing tends to get things back on track quickly.Make no mistake - this is a premium product . I 've tried a few store brand alternatives hoping to save some money , but I have yet to find anything cheaper that 's better . The Avery cards break apart clean , they look professional , and are perfect when a set of cards are needed in a hurry . The amount of time I 've wasted trying to get lesser quality cards produced easily makes the investment in the Avery cards worth it . I highly recommend !	1
I really liked this product for several reasons . These are great to print your normal business card on one side . Then if you are doing a limited time promotion , you can advertise the details of that on the back of the card ( with an expiration date ) . Plus , I like that I can use them to help me try out different designs for my card and then when I get it the way I really want , I can have a large number printed professionally . It 's not really cost effective to print several thousand cards using these.Very handy product !	1
These are a nice improvement over the older style printable card stock . They separate very cleanly , by 'snapping ' then inwards towards you.I printed on both sides using the templates from the site provided in the instructions . It was intuitive enough for the average user to setup the cards and print them easily.The colors were vivid , and did not smear when you rubbed your fingers over the cards , after leaving them sit for a few minutes to let them set.All in all a good value , and they look good enough to substitute for print shop printed cards .	1
I had been looking for this type of Business Card for some time . That is a way to make my own Business Cards and not having to pay a lot of money to have them made . These are very easy to work with . Just follow the instructions given to you and you will not have a problem making very professional cards yourself . I used them and I was quite please of the results . Just go the the Avery website and use the templates that are available . I am glad I found these .	1
These cards are are a great size . This was easy to set up in the printer . I used a raggedy ink jet printer and they came out great.This fits nicely in my card holder and I dont have to worry about the edges getting all messed up . overall a great product	1
Good for making your own business cards for a pretty reasonable price . Whether your starting your own business or just want to show off to your friends it 's a pretty decent product . The cards are a little thinner than normal but that 's probably so that it fits and feeds through your printer properly . They are very easy to use and can be done by using no software . Avery has provided a website for uploading images or choosing from pre-made templates . Overall it 's a nice product and you get a decent amount for the price .	1
These are a fantastic value ! Quality paper , comes with detailed and easy-to-follow instructions , fair amount of design templates to choose from and easy access to customer service if you have any questions . No complaints here at all , great product .	1
I 've been using Avery 8371 business cards for several years now , and my only complaint was that the edges were not completely smooth . The Avery 28878 `` Smooth Edge '' business cards solve that limitation and more.Compared to the regular 8371 , the 28878 offers : - completely smooth edges for a more professional finished presentation ( absolutely no micro-perforations ) - higher quality finish on side # 1So why ca n't I give them 5 stars ? Several reasons : - despite the upgraded finish on side # 1 , side # 2 actually bleeds more on my Canon inkjet in the highest qualityAvery 's instructions say to always print in the highest quality , but in reality this is only for side # 1 - use standard quality ( less ink ) when printing on side # 2- compared to the regular 8371 , the price difference is significant ( nearly 3x more expensive at Amazon 's discounted pricing ) If you need a professional finish , however that price is worth it.For over 11 cents per card , you 're probably still saving money vs a professional printer , but this should be considered .	1
I got way more than I expected with these Avery Business Cards . I knew the Clean Edge cards printed well and more importantly , separated cleanly ( I 'm still amazed how clean and sharp the edges are for a preforated sheet ) . But what I had never used before was the Avery website that offers templates to quickly create NICE business cards . There is a printed instruction sheet that comes with the card stock the clearly explains the process . I hopped onto Avery 's site , picked a nice template , filled in my info on one card and hit Print , and out of my Epson inkjet printer came a full sheet of VERY professional cards . Amazing . And , you can save the file and reopen it in the Avery website to make changes and reprint , and since the file resides on your PC , you do n't need to remember a login name . Does it get any easier ? ? Oh , and after you print , you can save the sheet as a PDF and just reprint whenever you 'd like . The card printing quality alone would make this a fantastic product ... adding the online templates makes it a SIX star product . I 'll be buying these again and again.Oh , did I mention that you can print on BOTH sides of these cards ? ? Fantastic ...	1
I 'm always skeptical of `` clean edges '' , but this product delivered . The matte finish and clean edge gives a very professional look . They `` snap '' out of the frame easily . Almost too easily - you have to handle them carefully when loading the printer . They take color well and really do look great . You really can print on both sides without bleed through . I used them for art exhibit tags and for my business cards . I was very happy with the results .	1
These are not exactly like one gets when business cards are printed professionally , but they are good to use for personal cards or if you are a start-up business . I admit due to my printer I wasted a couple of sheets which was not Avery 's card 's error . I would get these again for on hand use when I an waiting for a delayed re-order or just want a few fun business cards for special purposes . For the combined price and quality , I think this is a nice deal .	1
If you have a small business , cards are a necessity for keeping your name in front of potential customers . These are an affordable alternative to having cards printed . If you 've seen the various deals for free or inexpensive cards online , you may have discovered that they 're not so inexpensive when you add shipping or try to hurry up the order . I priced out a few deals and decided to try these Avery blanks . At a third the price , what 's to lose ? It turns out that there 's nothing to lose but a little bit of your time . Avery provides resources -- online and downloadable -- that you can use to design cards and align them for printing . If you have your own graphic resources , it 's a piece of cake to put your own images on the cards . Separation of individual cards from the sheet ( 10 on a sheet ) is easy and the cut lines are quite clean . There are no perforations and no indication the card is anything but professional . I 've seen some comments that the card stock is a little thin , but that 's not my experience . I recently worked for a large corporation , and my commercially-printed card was no thicker and no more professional in appearance.If you need cards in the hundreds , a real printer is still the solution . But for smaller quantities , it 's hard to go wrong with these .	1
I have used these cards many times and find that there is nothing competitive in the market.Pros : * The `` clean edge '' system for breaking up the printed cards into separate pieces is without equal . The cards break so perfectly that they look like they were cut apart instead of perforated . * These cards take ink really well and print nicely . * The paper is really white and the results really pop with great contrast.Cons : *NONESummary : Avery has some software for both PC and Mac called `` Design Pro '' which I find works really well with these . This is so much cheaper than `` professional '' card making that it really helps the self employed person on a budget . It 's especially great that you do n't have to order or make 500 cards at a time - you can just do what you need to do at the moment .	1
I received this product via the Vines Program ( samples are supplied at no cost for evaluation ) as I needed a small number of business cards for a couple of temporary employees . This product did a very nice job , was easy to use , and provided very professional looking cards.The link for the Avery website was easy to use and the templates that they supplied for their cards worked easily with MS Office and an HP OfficJet Printer . The only problems that I encountered had nothing to do with either the cards or the templates , instead , it had to do with the limitations of InkJet Printers . That limitation is the fact that ink from an inkjet is NOT waterproof ! Thus , if someone has wet fingers or places say a coffee cup that is damp upon a business card , the printing will run ! ! ! Just something to be aware of . However , that is a small limitation when you only need a run of say 20 business cards for a temporary employee . The solution is much more cost effective than paying for a run of 1000 cards that you will never use or just providing that employee with a generic card .	1
I really liked these Avery print-your-own business cards : they REALLY do have Smooth edges ! I have bought similar product in the past , and they just end up looking a little too non-professional . You barely notice the perforations here , making these ideal for quick , custom or temporary cards ! They are not as thick or finished as professional printed business cards , but they will do in a pinch , and are thicker than similar do-it-yourself cards I have bought in the past : this is likely as thick as they can be and still easily run through at-home printers ! There were some great Avery designs for cards you can use to create your own , that I thought were reasonable looking : my biggest complaint was with the software on that end : if you are used to graphics software like Adobe Photoshop , then this software will be too restricting for you , like it was for me.But for a basic , quick personal card , job search business card or custom items for a small business like coupons , or a little advertising , they are great ! You can print both sides , and they are reasonably professional looking : I give them 2 thumbs up ! !	1
I was a bit skeptical at first as far as easily making professional-looking business cards , but wow ... after using the online card templates and printing out my first cards within minutes of starting , I am impressed.The variety of templates available on Avery 's site was fairly large , with card styles to fit almost any need . I was quickly able to find one I liked , changed the text to fit my `` job , '' ( OK , I was making fun fake cards ... I admit it ) , and printed . The template worked perfectly , fitting the card image exactly as it should be on the card . The cards themselves easily snapped apart , and left absolutely no rough edges . They came out exactly as I would expect professional cards to look , with the exception of the `` flatness '' of the ink . This is not Avery 's fault , of course -- an ink-jet printer can not lay down thick ink as a professional card printing service can do . But the look itself is absolutely fabulous.If you do n't need a huge quantity of cards and/or you want to try out some really neat designs , these are perfect . I highly recommend them .	1
These Avery Business Card Sheets are great . Why pay big money at your local PrintShop for more cards than you need when you can just use these sheets in your PC andprint them as you need them ? It 's a no-brainer , really.There are some caveats ... you need to have pretty good software , along with the ability to use it properly . I did n't use anything fancy , just a Broderbund Print Shop CD that is a few years old , but still very useful . ( You can go to [ ... ] and use their software , but I did n't feel the need to do so . ) You should have a nice quality printer- I use an HP Photo Printer- and fresh ink cartrides . I find that cartridges that are nearly empty do n't work that well . You should also accept the fact that your results will not be EXACTLY like offset-printed cards , but will still be very nice for most purposes.In a matter of minutes , I designed and printed some nice-looking color cards featuring a photo and type layout . I am an artist , and they looked good to me . The Avery stock is smooth and bright and should be quite versatile . What 's not to like ?	1
These print great with either inkjet or laser . I prefer color laser . Just bend them over and they come apart very clean .	1
There is n't too much to say about these cards except that they are great ! The do tear neatly , print well and and simple to use . 5 star product .	1
I remember the ragged edges of prior cards , none of that here . These belong in every office arsenal . When your title or any info changes , you can run a sheet of these off while waiting for the professional ones to arrive .	1
This is a great product for someone who needs a low volume of cards or likes to switch things up often . Or maybe you just do n't have a firm idea on what you want and want a few testers . Easy to separate , good quality . Only as good as you printer though !	1
The instructions for these business cards sends you to the Avery site online , where you create your cards . There are both blank cards and ones with designs available , for all types of businesses . I chose a blank one , so I could add my own picture , instead of using a design . I did not find the software easy to use . And I could not for the life of me figure out how to do the back side ... unless , you do the front first , print , go back to the software and choose `` back side '' , and then stick the paper back in the printer again . Finally , I just gave up , and decided to use the Microsoft Digital Image 2006 I have on my desktop , which I 've used for previous business cards.Before turning on the desktop , though , I decided to try to install Digital Image 2006 on my laptop . I never thought about doing that before , since the laptop has Vista . Well , it installed with no problems , and no configurations needed , very quickly . And it 's working beautifully . With Digital Image , you can also choose cards that have designs , or are blank so you can add a picture . I find Digital Image far easier to use than Avery 's software . And when you print , it gives you 20 choices of business card types with numbers . It has the number for these Avery cards , so printing was also a breeze on my Canon i960 . The cards are beautiful , though not glossy , and easily separate by folding . I decided not to do a back side , since most people do n't look at the back of business cards anyway .	1
Avery has created a really nice Do It Yourself Business Card Sheet with these Clean Edge Business Cards . The size is great , 2 inches by 3 1/2 inches and they have a matte finish . The cards can be printed on BOTH sides , and each side of the sheet have arrows to show how to insert them into the printer , so you never make a mistake . I prefer glossy finished cards , but the colors come out looking nice and vivid on the matte finish , so this is just as good . Amazingly , after printing , when you punch out the cards , the edges are sleek and clean- no perforations , so you get a professional looking finished card . Avery includes their web site address where you log on to get full and easy directions to print your cards.These cards are great for many uses other than business cards , as their size and ability to print on 2 sides , give you an endless world of options . I 've printed cards up with calendars on one side and clients tend to keep these in their wallets , keeping your company 's name in view every time someone looks at a calendar date . The only thing I wish Avery would change is the thickness of the cards , as they are thinner than I would like . If they would make the cards thicker , they would look completely professional and this would make the product perfect !	1
Clean , brisk and does n't leave a stain ! This product is easy to use , worked on two different printers with excellent results . Just what the doctor ordered !	1
I have made up business cards with a number of different brand of blank cards and I have to say I like these the best . Colors transfer and show better giving you a nice crisp clean look . Standard size cards that are above standard quality especially for value . Why pay someone else to make your business cards and possibly not come away completely happy when you can make your own just as nicely as professional companies . I have been a long time user of Avery products and have come to expect a certain quality of product from them . These do n't disappoint ! Buy yourself some and have the fun experience of creating something of quality that you are most certainly going to be most happy with .	1
Over the years , whenever I 've needed to print some kind of personal or business project , I 've gone to the local office supply store . I get two choices : Avery and the store knock-off brand . The store brands usually cost a couple of dollars less , but it 's not by much ... and I ca n't tell you how many paper jams , misaligned prints and ruined projects I 've had to throw away because I did n't want to go ahead & get an Avery product . Some things you can get away with generics on -- for me , print projects are not one of them.This is a great product for the small business owner when you 're in a pinch in between business card orders . There are 4 different ways to put your content into templates , so whether you 're used to doing this in Microsoft Word , or you 've never printed your own cards before & are using Avery 's print online feature , it 's virtually foolproof . When you 're done printing , flip your sheet over and print some more information on that back part of the card that usually gets wasted . The printing is clean , bright & crisp -- what more could you ask for ? Tearing them apart is a breeze when you 're done printing . Just bend along the lines and the cards will snap apart with no rough edges . I 've had `` clean edge '' cards made by other brands , and I end up with torn , rough edges and useless cards every single time -- that is if the printer did n't eat the brand X sheet to begin with . Whether you 're in between card orders , you 're having a special event , or you 're just starting out and do n't want to make a huge business card order right away , these cards are a great solution . Please , save yourself some money and frustration , and get the Avery brand when you print from home . Highly recommend .	1
Avery is the name to go to in the printing world . i looked at the on line printers and they all started off with an affordable price , but in the end , they were to expensive . So , back to avery products i went . This is a fantastic looking , stiff business card , for what i do ... If i was needing to look like i worked for a Forbes 500 company , I would do the professional printing , but for what i use them for , it is great .	1
I create my own business cards and have used Avery cards for years . Of all the styles , the White Clean Edge are the best.If you 're designing a card for the first time , you can use an installed program like Print Shop or simply go to [ ... ] and create by product to get an assortment of templates ( one and two-sided ) . When you 've finished your design , click `` next '' and you 're ready to set up the printing procedure ( Note : these cards are designed to be used in InkJet printers ) .For best results make sure you choose a card stock paper type and set the printing mode to `` high '' .These cards do not `` tear '' as with other card stock . Rather , separate each card by folding the edges inward . The clean edge will `` snap '' and separate with ... a clean edge ! Easy to use with fantastic results . I attend arts and craft shows as a vendor and use these Avery Clean Edge business cards exclusively . Highly recommended .	1
These are great . We plan to actually use them for printing tags to attach to products for sale VS actual business cards . We can punch a hole in the end and tie with some ribbon to products . I am sure they would be just fine for business cards as well . Professional look !	1
Avery always makes fine products , and this is no exception . I bought this to use for flash cards , but I 've been making more direction and personal cards than that .	1
These cards are going to be largely what you make of them -- Do a nice job designing the your card and you 'll get a nice card . They do not look quite as nice as professional business cards ... But they are far cheaper . Perfect for a small business or individual who only needs a few cards .	1
It is great to make address cards for those who need to share the address , phone , something like that . I like it but my problem is that it did't print properly . Maybe I put it in wrong way or something . It just went off , not center or right in the cards , it is either lower or upper .	1
The Avery Clean Edge Business Cards came out of my printer looking very nice . I have an older printer which is an Epson Stylus CX4200 . The cards came out nicely centered on the card stock and the printing and picture is crisp and clean . I was sure to change the settings of my printer to let it know that it was thicker card stock and told it to use the best print setting . The ink dried very quickly so there was no worry about smearing the cards . The top and bottom of the card edges seem to come out cleaner than the side edges of the cards . The side edges still feel a little rough . While these are not as thick as a professional business card , they are decent and good to use for somebody that may just be starting up or need cards in a hurry . The price is good for what you get so that is also a plus for someone who may have a small budget to start out with . The web site was super easy to use to design the business cards . There were a lot of premade cards to choose from and all you have to do is put your personal information on the cards . There is also templates so you can design your own cards from scratch . I used a premade template to do my cards and I had them all done with in 5 minutes . Overall , a good product for the price that you pay . If your looking for professional business cards though , these probably are n't for you as the card stock is thinner than professional cards .	1
Great quality for the low price . Very sturdy and it does n't hide in the binder it serves the purpose very well .	1
These work great for indexing your notes in three-ring binders . The brown strip on the left-hand side keeps the holes from tearing , and I 've found that Avery products will last for years .	1
The Avery WorkSaver Big Tab Insertable Dividers are great for organizing paperwork in binders . The big tabs allow for more text and/or bigger text than some other styles . The tab is .5 '' wide.The gold strip prevents the holes from tearing and the paper stock is of decent weight . I have used these for many years and they last a long time.Highly recommended.PROS : - Big tabs ... makes it easier to see the text.- Gold strip reinforces the holes- Reasonably pricedCONS : - none	1
The tabs are big and nice for handwritten labels . The design of the tabs makes it easy to insert the labels . My only complaint is with printing labels - it took a lot of effort to get the downloaded program to accurately print the tabs .	1
They work as they should . the divided my papers just fine . It is also durable . Super , great , thank you much	1
These tabs are both functional ( useful ) and neat ( attractive ) . They help you keep your thoughts , papers , files , etc . organized in a neat and convenient way . They do their job , and they look really good . They look good in a binder , and the colors are nice . They are also strong and sturdy . There are 6 sets of 5 tabs.Highly recommended if you organize or have a use for them.Good for home , office , school , projects , etc .	1
I love the crisp , clean look of my organized binder . I used the Avery template with success but had a bit of difficulty navigating it . You will have an attractive , neat result with this product . The colors may not be suitable for all applications but they work very well for me with the organization of my graduate studies as well as the organization of the resources in my classroom . In both instances the vivid colors are beneficial . My only concern would be in making the site more user friendly .	1
In the Navy , I had a Leading Chief Petty Officer who became known as `` Chief Binder '' for his obsessive organization of our paperwork . It actually made our operations easier than the old method of stuffing everything in folders , since we now had a bunch of quick reference hardback manuals staged right at our stations . I sort of picked up on that , but decided to improve over Chief 's choice of generic goverment page dividers.I 've been using this brand of Avery tab dividers for about ten years now . The oldest ones are still intact -- no ripped holes or detaching tabs . I usually do n't print directly to the table of contents , but instead scan it into my computer and then add text boxes in a program such as MS Paint , Publisher , Adobe Photoshop , or InDesign . So I ca n't tell you if the ink fades from the TOC or not . The paper has n't yellowed and on the whole they 've held up through various moves and misadventures with my cats.On the downside , the paper tends to stain pretty badly when wet -- say , you leave your office window open for some fresh air , and somebody turns a sprinkler on outside and ends up watering your paper supply shelf more than the lawn . The sheets will also stick together when wet , and while they stay intact , look pretty warped and ugly.This pack appears to be just like the ones I 've been buying for years . I appreciate the large , easy to handle tabs , the study stock paper , and the fact that they follow a modest range of colors rather than trying to be a glossy rainbow . The dividers are attractive and yet business-like . The price is also good for the volume.I used a 5-divider pack as part of my technical writing internship portfolios , which earned me high marks overall . I also use the 5-tab for manuscripts , since I tend to go at least three drafts , plus various notes and artwork . When combined with Staples-brand super binders , I can color-code and be assued that the whole package will last on my shelf for at least a decade without falling apart or looking dowdy .	1
I like these dividers because they are more sturdy and easy to use as well as there is a great page to note what is behind each tab . I will use them in my business for years to come . I highly recommend this product .	1
These tab dividers are neat and very professional looking . I used them for paper-filing of tax returns this year . Nice to be able to organize different tax forms and associated documents ( copies of receipts etc ) using these tab dividers . The different colored sets also make it easy to categorize . The tabs are made of paper material so you can write on them . The only thing I would have liked is label stickers on a separate sheet on which you can possibly print and paste to the tabs - just like address labels.Overall , neat set of tabs .	1
I feel that I really got my bang for my buck with this purchase . I like to buy all my school supplies `` during the season '' for great deals like this . Where else can you buy Avery Ready Index Dividers for a buck a piece ? I love these dividers because they are colorful , functional , and pre-labeled . It really helps for organizing by loose-leaf binder books by chapter . What a time saver !	1
The problem with most of these products is that they do n't hold up . Tabs rip , pages rip , etc ... ..Sure most of that is on the handler , but I expect a durable product.I inserted these tabs into a notebook that I use EVERY day . It has been several months now , and they are still in the same shape as the day I first assembled the notebook.A true testament to this product 's durability . I was not disappointed , and I feel confident you wo n't either .	1
The Avery Ready Index allows a presenter to create their own index for their notes . The sheets are numbered 1-5 and each sheet has a space to list the items within the division . This is a good product . The cons are that I wonder how many presenters use notebooks any more . As a teacher , I do , but I am moving away from the need for notebooks the more I use PowerPoint . I was also disappointed that the tabs are prenumbered 1-5 . There are several sets in a package but I would 've preferred the ability to number or letter as I saw fit . The product itself is the great quality you expect from Avery .	1
I know , I know - you 're thinking `` so what , they 're just binder tabs . '' But when you put together materials in a 3-hole binder , the difference between professional and sloppy , or useful and confusing , is often just that - good dividers and a good index page.These dividers are really nice . As you can see from the product description and photos , you get 6 sets of 5 divider tabs numbered 1-5 within each set , plus a laser-printer-ready index page . The index page is color coded to the tabs , and both are in a modern , florescent color that will leave your materials looking jazzy . The tabs are slick plastic affixed to bond paper , and the whole package is very well put together . ( If you need more tabs than 5 per binder , Avery makes sets ranging from8 tabsper set to32 tabsper set , plus sets with tabs for the 12 months orA-Z ) ) .Given my choice , I might slightly prefer more sedate colors for some of my materials , but these `` contemporary '' fluorescents are eye catching and appealing . I strongly recommend these if a five tab set meets your needs .	1
You get six sets of these in one package . The inserts are numbered 1-5 and have a cover page so you can write in detail exactly what is in that section . I did n't think of it before I ordered them but when I saw them I knew exactly how I was going to use them ... for dividing the family tree notebook I am working on . Each generation can have it 's own number . I put them in a big 3 ring binder notebook and it works great . They are also good for research projects . At the moment I 'm doing research on my hometown and they are coming in really handy for that ... more so than the lettered ones would be since then nearly everything would be under one letter .	1
I got these to help us organize our monthly bills and statements , they work great ! I put them in hanging folders to keep me even more organized ... it is great to be able to access a bill for a particular month without sorting through the whole stack .	1
I run my own home business and have a ton of paperwork in binders . This product is very helpful in making indexes and keeping my binders organized , and allow me to find what I need in a pinch .	1
For many years , the only binder dividers I used was the Avery WorkSaver Big Tab Insertable Dividers . I stumbled across these Avery Ready Index Table of Contents ( TOC ) divider # 11187 and wanted to see how they compare.The main difference is that the text for the TOC dividers is written on a single table of contents page instead of on each tab . With the TOC dividers , the numbers 1 to 5 are pre-printed on the tabs.Here is theAvery WorkSaver Big Tab Insertable Dividers , 5-Tabs , 1 Set ( 11109 ) that I usually purchase . After comparing the two , I prefer the insertable tabs , but both have their advantages as follows.The Index TOC # 11187 has slightly heavier paper . Also , the package of 6 sets of 5 dividers is very economical.But what I prefer with the insertable tabs # 11109 is that you do n't need to refer to the TOC index page since text is on each tab . Also , gold strips reinforce both sides of the divider page , whereas the TOC divider # 11187 has a clear reinforcement strip on only one side of the page.In summary , although I prefer the insertable dividers , the TOC dividers are an economical alternative.PROS OF THE TOC Divider # 11187 : - Economical- Slightly thicker paperCONS OF THE TOC Divider # 11187 : - Requires an extra step to refer to the TOC Index page to determine the contents of each divider- Single-sided reinforcement strip is not as durable as the gold stip of the insertable divider # 11109	1
Simply put , Avery Ready Index Contemporary Table of Contents Dividers are the gold standard for reports and presentation binders . The finish , the materials and the reliability of this product have never let me down . I used these when I worked for a trade association when I did presentations for a committees and boards of directors . When I ran my own consulting company I used them . Now that I 'm back to working for a company , I still use this product , and the result are consistently superior.The product allows to to take a report or presentation , add section tabs and a table of contents . The section tab pages are reinforced and hold up even after years of use . The colors are bright and catchy . The table of contents feeds through laser printers without jams and come out looking great.If I could suggest anything to Avery , it would be to introduce this product with versions for comb binding and spiral binders.But aside from that - these are office supply all-stars !	1
Attractive dividers , sturdy , well spaced , easy to write on and erase , good colors , professional looking . I strongly recommend this product and this company.Five stars .	1
Avery Ready Index Table of Contents Dividers are an easy way to add an extra level of sophistication to a report or presentation . The inkjet or LASER printer compatible table of contents page has colored segments with corresponding tabbed sheets for each section . The tabs are plastic coated so they do not get folded over and seem durable . The colors really stand out and make finding the individual sections easy . The only thing I would want is the ability to add my own words to the tabs , rather than just having numbers.As someone who reads a lot of reports and presentations , I recommend Avery Ready Index Table of Contents Dividers for students and those in a professional environment . These make your work easier to read and make your work more presentable .	1
They are dividers , so you can only say so much about them but they worked well for my purposes and i liked the colors .	1
One of my daughter 's teachers hit her with an EXTRA supply list on the first day of school . rah rah . These fit the bill and help avoid any unnecessary meltdowns on the part of myself or my daughter . which is always a good thing . Good price and came quickly .	1
I homeschool two children and trust me ... papers abound when you homeschool . I bought these tabs to separate subjects , children and assignments I prepare for class.I use this particular set ( with the slash pocket ) to hold assignments and fact sheets I prepare for class.They 're sturdy ; they keep everything organized and they allow me to keep my sanity amidst kids and paper.I definitely recommend them to others . The tabs themselves have been set up so that you can print them on your computer/printer or handwrite them and NO LONGER are they the up/down fold that was very UNhandy to write ... they now fold from the side and also tell the template to use on your computer . GREAT IMPROVEMENT !	1
I like that they are sturdy pocket dividers . I bought two packs and created a household notebook to organize my bills and important papers .	1
Avery makes great quality office/home products . These are no exception . Good 'thickness ' which means durability for years to come in my scrapbooks that I am working on . Buy them !	1
These Avery Big Tab Two Pocket Insert-able Plastic Dividers are useful for so many purposes ! For me , I recently began using them in a Household Folder . In that folder I have 5 categories : Appliance Info , Auto Info , Budget Info , Projects , and Misc.What is so handy about these dividers with pockets is this : I use the pockets for small items such as small receipts , small note info on a product , or anything smaller than an 8 by 11 sheet of paper.Also these dividers are very well constructed and will hold up I believe for a very long time.If you need something that will help you become more organized , then I believe that this item will benefit you greatly ! Highly recommend this .	1
These are a great tool for organizationally challenged students who tend to lose or misplace loose papers , but the truth is I use them too . They are sturdy , they can hold a surprising amount paper , and they add a splash of color to otherwise boring binders .	1
The pockets on these come in handy in so many situations ! ! I go to college and in a rush , sometimes you do not have time to put your work in the binder correctly . These inserts allow you to safely keep your work in your binder so you can properly put it into its proper place later . It is also great for papers teachers give you that do not have a three-hole punch already in them ! ! Love the colors ! ! They stand out and really help in organizing your binder !	1
They serve their purpose very well by providing tabs and pockets as described . I just wanted sturdy plastic dividers , and even though they are very flexible plastic , they will suffice . I would imagine that if this was for school , it would come in very handy with the pockets on either side . They come with tab inserts which you can print on .	1
This works well if you are looking for a BIG two pocket insertable dividers . I bought the wrong ones , but cant knock the product for my mistake . These look quality and will use them for something else .	1
is item just so food , i do n't know more to say , if you need paper divider , this is the one you should own .	1
As good as other Avery stationaries , these tabs are of good quality , lasts long time . The price here on Amazon is the cheapest I found so far , for 8-tab set .	1
I file my medical and financial records in binders - these dividers are perfect to store various odds and ends which otherwise fall out when you put them in the pocket in the binder - could n't figure out how to print the tab inserts so just wrote them out and they 're fine	1
I just purchased a couple more packs of these yet again for my summer classes , and I have to say , the quality is exactly as it 's always been - phenomenal . I 'm currently a college senior , and these pocket dividers are my top must-have item for every class I take , right behind my livescribe notebooks . They make organization incredibly easy and simple , I 'm never scrambling to find my syllabus or my labs or any other charts or diagrams I need . It 's always just right at my fingertips . Whether you 're in high school or college or beyond , you will not be sorry purchasing these ! I wish I had been able to find them in high school , they are INFINITELY better than the standard paper dividers with the color tabs . I love Avery products , they definitely represent a brand of quality when it comes to office supplies , but hands down these are one of my favorite . Thanks Amazon for supplying a great product ! I will be back again for the fall semester !	1
We have a small trade school and use these for our students . Last year they worked out great so I 'm ordering several more for use in 2012.I make up student notebooks , and insert handouts in the pockets of these dividers . The plastic holds up well and withstands lots of abuse . The colors are great and help to organize the information into categories for quick retrieval . I do n't always stick with the exact same products from year to year , I tend to switch around a lot in my never ending attempt at perfection . In this case , I really do n't think I 'll find anything I like better , so it makes my job a lot easier to know I can stick with these dividers . Could n't be happier !	1
I homeschool 2 children - lots of lessons , lots of work papers , lots of filing . These plastic dividers are great for organizing things . The lesson plans and any worksheets I 've created get kept in the pocket until they 're in use . Once used , the teacher aids and lessons are filed behind the tab , which are followed by two tabs ( one per student ) where I keep their completed worksheets . When school officials want to check home school records , everything is in one place ... lesson plans , worksheets by student.The tabs and the pockets are sturdy and hold up to daily use . I 've ordered more for School Year 2014 already .	1
These are very thick plastic pocket dividers , and they come in several bright opaque colors.Features : Insert-able label tabs ; diagonal pockets on each side ; three holes to fit bindersI had been looking for a folder with multiple pockets to carry the various papers I need for work , and I found these and put several of them in a binder with Velcro pocket and TA-DA , I have a wonderfully organized , clearly labeled , and easy to use work kit . My favorite part about them is how incredibly durable they are . I 'm confident I 'll be able to lug my binder around in the field and the pockets will probably last longer than the binder itself .	1
These tabs are great . Not cheap quality . Goes great in binders to keep papers organized . Very good for office use .	1
I really liked these dividers because the ones that are made of reinforced paper always seem to rip over time . I like the pockets even though I do n't use them that often but they are a nice bonus .	1
I 've found these to be a huge step up from the paper dividers I always had to use years ago in grade school . These work better than paper dividers because they never tear at the holes or elsewhere . Therefore , I think it 's worth spending a little more money on them , though they 're reasonably-priced . I wish that the labels were a little easier to read through the plastic- the plastic is nice but is a bit dark over a white label like that . They can be used and re-used for many , many years due to the durability . I use these dividers in three different types of work-1 ) For college : I like to use the front pocket for work due ; the back pocket , for work completed . That way , when it 's time to turn the finished assignment in , I always know exactly where it is within my binder . Each divider can of course hold one subject , but they 're also great to sub-divide even within just one pocket . In college , I can sometimes need four or five dividers just to break up the various types of different course materials : blank graph paper , blank lined paper , completed notes and workbook pages are four examples.2 ) For my own personal cookbook/recipe collection : I typed up old recipes that were written on index cards , were torn out of magazine articles or that were written on scrap paper through the years . I bought I nice , zippered binder , then three-hole-punched all of my personal recipes . I separated the recipes by category ( drinks , vegetable dishes , pork , chicken , breakfast dishes , etc . ) in alphabetical order for both the categories and the recipes themselves . Then I just simply filed each recipe accordingly behind each divider page . Anytime I find a new `` winner '' of a recipe which is n't in a formal cookbook of it 's own , I put the page in the front of the divider based on it 's category . When I have time , I simply type the recipe and follow the steps needed to complete adding it to the binder . No more searching through a zillion old , yellowing , easily-torn recipes to find my chicken Divan sauce recipe anymore ! 3 ) For an Office in a Bag ( as taught to me by FlyLady Maria Cilley ) : Everyone 's categories vary , but mine are Bill-Paying ( bills-to-be-paid in front pocket , already-paid bill receipts in back pocket of the divider ) , Blank [ lined ] Paper ( good for writing out to-do lists , grocery lists , etc . ) , Emergencies ( where I keep directions to the hospital , the telephone number of the State Police , etc . ) , Friends & Family ( in this I keep gift ideas , a list of when birthdays are , directions to their homes for when I go visit them , etc . ) and finally a divider for Household Routines ( a print-out of my daily & weekly chores , a how-to-do-laundry chart in case I 'm sick or traveling & someone else is taking care of my chores for me ) . Stick a couple of pens and a few other office supplies in a zippered pencil case and your Office in a Bag should be good to go .	1
Bang for the buck and I got a & # 34 ; ton & # 34 ; of these for such a low price . These are actually used at offices and grocery stores so I figured what could go wrong ?	1
Thought it would be a little bigger or thicker did not see the dimension on the description . This does do the job as they are sharp and we use these to open boxes.For everyone else looking for the dimension they are as follows : Each cutter measures 4 inches x 7/8 inches x less than 1/8 inch thick weighs 0.9 ozA little longer than a stick of gum . Juicy Fruit is my fav .	1
In the grocery business for over thirty years and have seen the quality of box cutters decline along with the blades that go with it . This product is n't that kind . Heavy duty and will last for years . Make sure you order the right blades for this product and you will be very happy . Heavy duty this product is ! Also a very lite coat of WD-40 will make it slide in and out a lot easier as you break them in .	1
This things are great ! I did only get three colors but I would n't care if they were all pink . I work in retail and my pockets are always stuffed with keys , pens , and all kinds of junk . This tiny carton cutters are perfect for opening boxes and stocking shelves . Its easy to slip one in your pocket without adding much more bulk , but I would definitely keep it seperate from your cell phone . I always look for these at the big home stores because they are easy to lose and the blades wear out over time . Either way a good item at a fair price .	1
Good quality , great value and fast shipping.I usually lose these fast , however with the bright colors they stick out.They are not made cheap.They were the best price when I was looking , even lower priced than the cheap blades .	1
These are tiny box cutters , about the size of a stick of gum . There is a stop guard on the non-sharp end to prevent the metal piece that has a tiny blade at the top from falling out , and it has a retractable blade . This is a small enough blade that it is not going to cut through really difficult , thick packing material . But for regular boxes , such as those coming from an Amazon delivery , it works fine.With 12 of them included in a small box , there are enough of them to carry one in my purse , in my car , and keep one in a drawer in every room in the house . Which is probably what I 'll do , because I have a terrible habit of misplacing box cutters we 've owned in the past . Even after doing all that , there will be enough left over to pass on to friends and family.It comes in three nice colors , red , white and blue . I 've included photos so you can see what they look like .	1
Cuts boxes and tape . Cheap , love them . You can put them all over the house in various rooms so you never need to look for one .	1
I 'm really glad I found a place to buy these cutters , as it 's geting harder and harder to find these box knives .	1
I put this on my cat and stick em up on the wall after I hose him off once a week . He gets dirty living under the porch and needs a good scrubbing now and then . Once he gets dry I leave the velcro on him for the next time . Works great .	1
I 've used this for attaching various things to desks and shelves . LED lights , remote controls , lcd displays , etc . So far I have n't had any issues with it coming undone either from the velcro or the adhesive backing . I 'm probably not putting more then 5lbs on it at a time , but it 's definitely something that comes in handy frequently .	1
This is a light weight velcro with adhesive that seems strong enough . More white than transparent . Good to hold paper and other light materials together .	1
hmm ... Velcro ... .comes in a roll ... cut to size needed ... sticks great ... stays on well ... comes in a few colors . I got clear , but the fuzzy part was white , so it really defeats the purpose right ?	1
I love this sticky back velcro . It 's even better than double-sided tape since I can pull off the item easily . So far , I have used it to mount a message board and also a small waste basket . The adhesive and velcro is very strong .	1
I 've used sticky back Velcro a number times over the years for projects and usually gunk up my scissors . This cut really well without the added gunk .	1
Great deal ! ! Can use as much or as little for the project .	1
This roll of sticky backed Velcro is the handiest stuff when you need to stick something up , down , or sideways . I have a large computer system , and a 7 port USB hub that I could not keep in one spot . It kept sliding around and falling off the back of my desk . So , I bought this Velcro , and stuck the hub to my desk top . Now it do n't go nowhere . But , it has so many more uses as well . Anything that needs to be stuck in place , but still be removeable is a candidate for Velcro . Great product .	1
I have found many uses for this product . Should have bought it years ago . When you need something attached , use velcro .	1
This roll of velcro is the only way to go . It comes in a 15 foot length and has very strong adhesive . I am very pleased with this product . I am now on my second box . When I get this I always fold the two sides over on itself ... then just cut the length I need and both pieces are always the same size .	1
I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless . I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble ( have to press hard for it to register ) . No drops , no abuse . The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic . The keys feel hollow and light . The available functions are great . This is a classic calculator . But the functions are no good if the keys stop working ...	-1
These ubiquitous texas instrument calculator that everyone thinks are so great are complete garbage . Compared to 15c or 42s by HP this is not a tool , but a child 's toy or just a piece of land fill luggage .	-1
Overall I do not recommend this product . I remember this calculator from several years ago during various math classes . Bought this as a replacement as I require a calculator with specific test specifications . Works great and very intuitive , however the keys require just enough more pressure than they used to so that it is annoying . Perhaps they will become broken in . Not yet though .	-1
Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator . Apparently , TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI 's Website . However , the calculator is complicated to use , and you almost need a course to learn how to use it . Furthermore , the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out . But let me assure you they are definitely there , and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead .	-1
Parents : If you 're going to buy your child a graphing calculator for school , DO N'T insult his/her intelligence with this limited function calculator . Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college . What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs , GREs , AP tests , high school , algebra , calculus 1-3 , college , etc ... If you buy a TI-83 , you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82 , which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math , but it 's a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III . I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3 , but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work : The TI-83 is a piece of junk . It 's for kiddies in 6th grade.The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its `` pretty print '' and units system . Plus with the right software mods , you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.However I realize you 're just trying to find info on the TI-83 . My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is : do n't bother . It 's a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86 . It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college ( Calculus I-III ) . A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.It 's like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari . It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well . The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum . It can tackle small stuff but will hold its own when the big beasts come around .	-1
This product is for real geeks only . I bought it as a souvenir and office decoration.If you want something serious and practical , get an iphone ( or any other smartphone ) and a financial calculator app that can do Black-Scholes option pricing and many other fixed income and derivative stuff that this calculator can not do .	-1
This is a good calculator as would be expected from Texas Instruments , who have been in the calculator business for decades . A calculator should do the functions that it is supposed to do , which this calculator does . However , like several other 's have noted , the keys can be a challenge . I 've had to start over after entering a number due to the numbers not enterring as they should have . A good press of the keys takes care of that issue , but most calculators do not need to have the keys pressed firmly for the correct operation ... If Texas Instruments could redesign around the key issue , this would be a five star calculator , as the case and display are well designed . I have only used this calculator for a total of maybe 15 - 20 hours , and the keys may work better over time , but I have not seen any change during the timeframe noted.Update 6/16/11 - I 'm hoping that I ended up with a lemon , and that this is not an indicator of TI 's quality standards . I 'm dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars . The decimal button works only when pressed firmly as do several other buttons on this calculator . When taking a timed test in a finance class , this calculator really failed me because of these issues . Even being aware of the issues with the calculator I found myself having to redo calculations several times for most of the problems due to the calculator not taking the decimal point . In over thirty years of using calculators I have never had one with issues like this . At this point , I 'd only recommend this calculator to my enemies , not my friends .	-1
UPDATE : After a couple of weeks my opinion of this has dropped . The only good thing is that it has the same nylon covering as the original version . But the gel ( or whatever they use now , it used to be gel ) feels as hard as a rock and is really unpleasant to use . I thought I could live with the thinner padding but this is really really unpleasant to use.This is n't a worthless wrist rest but I 'm giving it one star because Fellowes should n't be selling this under the same product ID ( down to the model number ) when it 's significatnly different.It is significantly shallower ( in terms of thickness ) and hence does n't offer nearly as much padding . It 's also shallower front to back.This is n't a bad wrist rest ( and they are much cheaper now : I paid roughly $ 13 for this compared to $ 18 4 years ago for the same product ID ) , but they are not in any way the previous generation.Some people might consider this a better product as they make not like the height of the earlier ones .	-1
Busted open the second day . Too much weight on it or a crappy product ? Maybe just a flawed item in the mass distribution ? Whatever the reason , it busted open ( cool to see the gel stuff though : ) Wo n't buy ever again , though .	-1
Lasted only about a month before the edges started coming apart . After 2 months , it was totally dirty and had to be trashed . Worst mouse pad I 've ever used and that counts the free ones I get at conventions .	-1
Should I be complaining about something that was less than a dollar ? Yes , absolutely.The top layer of material , the red layer , is coming off from both the top and bottom of the muse pad after about a week 's worth of normal use . The adhesive or bonding process is n't holding the two layers together.The size of the mouse pad is very good.It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.Waste of time with this mouse pad . Surprised at the lack of quality from Belkin .	-1
This was delivered without the starter pack and without the carrier . Had no way to try it out . Returned to sender .	-1
I bought it here it was supposed to be NEW and Genuine.But I got an opened unit , NO seal , NO yellow cover , NO instructions , NO orig box , it was just wrapped hastily in bubble wrap ( small bubbles single layer ) and put in an already used amazon box with cracks . Upon inspection , the roller was dusty and had hair on it ! I left a poor review for the seller , but he begged me to delete the review and for shipping refund . If anything I should have returned the item but I needed to use it . Upon use it leaked all over the place , I had to spend a long time maintaining the unit and wiping with dry ( not wet ) paper towels . It worked for a day and then slowly it leaked all over again ! The fax came in all totally smudged with ink . I thought my machine was old and had a tech come over to look , We replaced the toner and it worked fine , WTH ? ! I pay good money for bad crap , never again ! $ 65 here vs $ 99 @ Office Depot , but you get what you pay for !	-1
Our printer is listed on this package , however it is cleary the wrong cartridge . Ours uses the 220 which is shorter . Rather than trust the package check your cartridge prior to ordering . The number is clearly visible .	-1
You get what you pay for . Cheap is cheap . Sometimes they work , sometimes they do n't . But to hand out to clients that will not return , it 's perfect , that was we do n't lose our better pens .	-1
My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall . This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding . Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces . Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom . The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks , which supported the weight of the picture . All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter . I note two things that partially excuse this : the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture 's placement was near a heat vent . This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product , but that is n't saying much .	-1
Look , it is a mouse pad . It really does n't even & # 34 ; work & # 34 ; - it just is , except when it comes apart . Two days , that 's all I got . Bad Dog .	-1
The color was coming off within a few weeks . Within a month , all the edges are peeling . This has got to be one of the worst mousepads ever made .	-1
I got this for very cheap and well worth it as an add-on item , a few days later the price doubled as most things on Amazon do . Just keep watching the item you might score .	-1
I have one in red also , I bought both at the same time.After just a few days of use , the top ( colored ) layer is separating from the bottom ( base ) layer.Belkin usually makes high quality products.I 'm very disappointed in these mouse pads.I would not recommend them .	-1
I ordered 2 premium mousepads . Amazon sent 1 premium and one 65 cent standard blue.The premium one makes my new-ish Logitech optical mouse skip , hang , lag . It does work on my 15 year old Microsoft Explorer optical mouse.Also , the edges are so sharp I feel like I 'm going to slit my wrist on it.Would not recommend .	-1
How bad can a mouse pad be ? That 's what I thought ... .First , be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad . Basically , it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32 '' foam pad . Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads , but a foamy pad.The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides , and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.The mouse pad is n't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it . It is very distracting.Finally , the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it . VERY annoying.This is the WORST mouse pad I 've ever used.The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles , so 2 stars .	-1
This stand may be good for pamphlets , ring-bound manuals , magazines and typing sheets but definitely not for text books . It is unstable and the page holders ca n't hold any page open for even a nano second . Try the The Easi-Reader Bookstand or Mighty Bright Folding/Adjustable Book Holder instead .	-1
These labels are too small for return address ' . They could work with postcards , but not much else .	-1
only .5 '' high not 1 '' fabric is not durable , wears through and hard to keep cleanother than obvious lack of function due to height , no leaks , does not stiffen up over timeInnovera is a better brand	-1
The wrist pad I brought a couple of months ago had a terrible smell when I purchased it and the smell is still there but not as strong . Now the gel is coming out at the seams . I can not use the wrist rest and I tried to fix it but it can not be fixed . I would not recommend this item .	-1
I use these labels with `` Poly Bubble '' mailers to ship items . Twice in the last couple of months I 've had items returned because the labels came off at some point during shipping . The mailers I 'm using are brand new and have a smooth surface ; there is no reason an address label should n't stick to them . It 's possible these labels work better with paper-based envelopes and mailers , but I no longer trust these labels and am in the process of looking for an alternative .	-1
I tried this product and liked it , but tried to call Avery to gather more information on their products and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs to Manilla , Philippines ! ! ! On their web site , Avery give the appearance that they are located in Brea , California , but in reality all of their consumer inquires , information on their products , software support , and general questions are all routed to the Philippines . I was not able to connect with anyone in the USA after more than 30 minutes on the phone with several different people in Manilla.In addition , all of their products are manufactured in either Mexico or China . I am hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with any their products . **************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the `` Consumer Service Center '' in Manilla : I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 to help me make the labels . It took some time to download and install , but well worth the time . The wizard was easy to use . Once you down load the software there will be a new toolbar in Microsoft Word . You simply click the Avery button and it gives you a comprehensive list of all of the Avery products ( listed by product number ) . After that is takes you through a few easy-to-understand wizard windows to enter the text and layouts your labels . Once completed , you have a MS-Word document that you can save on your computer and reprint if needed . I was able to make address labels with a small graphic quite quickly and easily.Even though these are listed for use on a Laser printer , I used them on my ink-jet printer and they turned out quite well . Even after roughing up the label by crunching it up , it stayed clear and legible . The `` Easy Peel '' backing allows you to reposition or remove the label although it does hold in place and will not easy fall off .	-1
Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec , you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers , 1 x 2-5/8 Inches , Box of 3000 Labels ( 5160 ) . The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper . It then offers you `` Pop-up Edge for fast peeling '' . I do n't think it is worth the extra charge at all . Go get the basic one . You will be very happy with it .	-1
I tried this product and liked it very much , but tried to call Avery to gather more information and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs ! ! ! If you call Avery 's Consumer Service Center ( 1-800-462-8379 number listed on their web site as Brea , California ) you will be given several choices of support all of which route you to their customer , product , and software staff in Manilla , Philippines.I wanted to get more information on where their products are manufactured . The operator I spoke with and her supervisor both assured me that all Avery products are made in the U.S.A. in Brea , California , but some of the raw materials may be from other countries . They were unable to route me to anyone in Brea to confirm this information . After examining the packaging I have I found a sticker that said `` Made in Mexico . '' Other Avery products I have say either Mexico or China . None say U.S.A.I am very hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with their products . **************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the `` Consumer Service Center '' in Manilla : I have used sharpie pens on all my well-used file folders and decided to try these file folder labels by Avery . I was surprised how well they blocked out the old hand-written tabs with clean new labels . The TrueBlock Technology is simply a silver backing on the sticky side of the label.As for the templates , I downloaded the Avery 8366 template for MS-Word on Avery 's website , but was disappointed that I could not get the text to center on the label when I increased the text to a legible size . So , I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 . It took some time to download and install , but well worth the time . The wizard was easier to use than the template . It comes with a few colorful graphics to make your labels interesting . I was able to use a big text size and center the text vertically and horizontally.Once I had my labels printed out , it was easy to peel and place the labels right in the file drawers , and I had a whole file drawer of easy-to-read folder tabs.A couple side notes . 1 ) Avery required that you give them your name and email for downloading a simple template which I did n't like . In addition during the Avery Wizard 4.0 install there is a box automatically checked to also install the Avery `` Ask '' toolbar and make it your default search engine . You can easily uncheck it , but rather tricky of Avery to set as the default to install additional software on your computer . 2 ) If you try and remove the label on your file folders , they do not easily release and you 'll peel off some of your file folder with the label.Again , this may be a useful product , but very disappointing that Avery continues to outsource all their customer support and manufacturing !	-1
I was pleased to receive these as I had filing to do . I printed out a sheet of file labels , and then applied them to file folders I was re-using . I was extremely disappointed as I could see the writing right through the label , making for a very messy look . NOT recommended at all . I had to go buy new labels ...	-1
Yeah , it 's a mouse pad , but the top surface is poorly attached and curled up very quickly . Better to have one that 's all one piece .	-1
Great classic design . I imagine it is a wonderful phone if you get one that works . Mine refused to ring , and yes I checked the ring setting . Returned it .	-1
This phone started to have problems around the 1yr mark . First , a lot of static and now it just keeps disconnecting calls . Looking for another .	-1
Great price on the phone , but quality of sound is not good . It still can be used if you main phone broke and you need temporarily to use something else until you purchase a better phone .	-1
August 2012 . I purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage . They work - meaning they ring - but I get complaints about voice quality on every call . Cost was $ 9.00 each with free shipping ( assuming the order totaled at least $ 25.00 ) Despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted , those statements are simply NOT true . I have two of these phones , both of which are currently wall mounted . As noted in the instructions , you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting . That clip then provides a tab/hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit . This type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that I 've ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically . To switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than 5 seconds.Another bit of confusion . A few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one . That is not true , at least in 2012 . The cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will.Yet despite that mis-information - I 'm VERY disappointed with the voice quality . Every time I answer these phones people complain ( unsolicited ) about the voice quality . A hard wired phone ( as opposed to a cordless ) should sound great but clearly these phones do n't ! Your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a Panasonic , at about $ 30.00 .	-1
I ordered i think 4 70-sheet notebook spirals , and 2 100-sheet sprials from this company that sent me the wrong items from SAM 'S club ? ? But I didnt return the 2 1oo-sheet spirals along with the 4 120-sheet spirls ? because 1 . I didnt feel like waiting for them any longer when I needed them for school 2 . So that i would n't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it 's okay that my order got wrong . I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened ... They are nice notebooks though . Paper quality is a bit thicker than your average thin ..smearable paper if you write with pencil alot ( which I do n't unless its a math or number involved class ) I like them .	-1
I have owned the Brother HL-1240 Laser Printer about a year now . I have no quarrels with the printer itself , but the cartridges are a real pain.The first four cartridges I used the 3000-copy cartridge . They ran out really quickly , so I shifted to the TN-560 6000-copy cartridge.Here is the amount of copies I got on the four 3000-copy cartridges : 2000 , 2500 , 2500 , 1900.This is the performance I 've gotten on the first two TN-560 600-copy cartridges I 've used : 4600 and ****2500*** ! ! ! For the latter , a black line appeared on the right side of the page after 2500 copies , making the cartridge useless , even though it still had ink.Tip for getting more copies from these Brother toner cartridges : you can often get an additional 300-500 copies after the red light on the printer starts blinking , indicating you need to change the toner . But it is very irritating having that light blink all the time.I am trying to figure out who I should complain to about these very poor product ... . every single toner cartridge I 've bought from them so far vastly under-performs -- up to 40 % -- on the number of copies promised by Brother .	-1
There are two hundred sheets in the package which is the average size . This package of wide ruled filler paper looks like the standard elementary school paper that kids have always used . That is before you take it out of the package . Paper used to be two or three times as thick as this when I was in school . This paper if so thin that it 's totally transparent when you hold it up to the light . When writing on it with an ink pen the ink goes totally through it . In addition it rips very easily and if it gets at all wet then you are done.Other that the thinness problem the paper is normal . The lines are the correct spacing and are dark enough for the most part but there are some pages that are lighter than others.The price of this package of paper stunned me at 3 dollars a pack . I can purchase the same amount of paper from my local grocery store for about 1 dollar a package . When they have back to school sales it 's often only about 50 cents a pack so why on earth would I pay that much for paper ? Overall when I consider the quality of the paper and the price I simply am not impressed and would not recommend this paper .	-1
I am so disappointed in Mead . I know that this is a standard product , not a luxury version . It is just plain old lined paper . But it is such bad paper . It is thin . It has not tooth . The printing of the lines is not consistent . They are darker in some places than others . It is thin enough that my lefty went through it easily.This all just makes for an awful writing experience . Basic does n't have to mean worthless .	-1
The paper is thin and rips easily . I thought it would be fun to give my 7-year-old a notebook full of paper to use as she wished this summer , but even though she 's a pretty careful kid , pages have already ripped at the holes and need reinforcements . I expected more from Mead . This is more along the lines of what I 'd expect from a dollar-store brand .	-1
I got this paper for my first grader to practice writing with . I never thought I would complain about binder paper , but this paper is pretty awful . The paper , while it serves its purpose , is really quite thin . I would n't recommend using pen on this paper , and heaven forbid you try to use marker or anything liquid on it . With pencil , it works just fine . My biggest issue is when you need to erase . If you have a light hand , erasing should n't be a problem . However , with wide ruled paper , most people who use it are little kids ... and if your kid is like mine , erasing is practically a full arm production . The paper is not durable enough to withstand the erasing of a six year old or from people who are vigorous when erasing.That aside , the paper does serve its purpose . My kid , when he did n't make mistakes , was able to write very easily on the paper , and it did n't smudge much . If you 're pressed for time and want to order paper online , this will definitely serve its purpose . Otherwise , I would wait for upcoming back to school sales . You can get much higher quality paper at a comparable price .	-1
There is nothing to write home about this paper . The paper is very thin and the writing shows on the other side of the sheet quite a bit .	-1
This would be a real deal -- if only it was compatible with Windows XP , which it is not . Before you buy it , use a good search engine to find user comments , and you 'll discover that ( 1 ) Brother is still negotiating with Microsoft over XP drivers , and ( 2 ) Brother 's support is non-existent . Even their website is useless.Not good .	-1
I had to throw this printer out . It was simply too unreliable.The first unit I had streaked . After three exchanges of the printer , they finally sent me a new drum.This printed for about 4 months , and the streaks re-appeared.I have never been so aggravated by a printer and suggest extremecaution before buying .	-1
There 's no reason to order this paper when you can get comparable paper delivered from Staples or Office Depot at a fraction of the price . Also , after making the switch to that generic paper , I 've experienced fewer jams on my inkjet printer .	-1
My order came from 'The Witz and Sons ' , fulfilled by Amazon.I 've bought HP ink through Amazon for years and never once had an issue . This time what I received was questionable.The product is advertised as being in retail packaging , and the photo shows an HP package.However , when I opened the Amazon box , what was inside was not in an HP retail box . Instead the ink cartridge arrived `` unboxed . '' There was no HP cardboard box . It arrived in only the HP inner foil package . That means there was NO HP box , NO UPC and , of course , NO explicit expiration date listed.The only thing on the package , outside of the HP logo , is a foil code . In my case the foil code is SG2 110800 100218 1133 . I happen to be familiar with the codes on HP foil , so reading the two sets of six numbers in yymmdd format , I was able to see that what I was sent had an `` ink warranty '' that expired about 9 months ago back in August 2011 ( 110800 ) , and was produced in February of 2010 ( 100218 ) .While many people use ink past the warranty date , that should be the choice of the consumer . Here , it seems likely the seller removed the box to try to pass off a `` old '' product as fresh , which is deceitful , at best .	-1
This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen . If you download the optional ink reserve software you can actually see your expensive inks disappear . Granted , when the printer is working properly you can get wonderful images . If you are not constantly printing , the nozzles will clog . It is almost impossible to find anyone to work on these printers because the nozzles are built into the printer . After throwing a couple hundred down the drain on this printer , I smartened up and bought a Canon Pro9000 . My new Canon is a wonderful wide format printer with easy installation and the nozzle cartridge is removable !	-1
Doing a simple internet search will take you down the path to finding this product currently for $ 29.97 . Do not pay this seller twice it 's value , especially since most of us do n't have land lines anymore . Anyone selling it for so much is trying to unload their inventory and get their money back . Buyer beware and do your research . That being said , any device that sends out the `` disconnected line '' tones will be effective against robocalls . Other cheaper options are to download the sound of a fax machine onto your laptop and play that when you see a robocall come in . Of course you 'd only be successful at that method if you kept getting repeat robocalls from the same unknown area code.If you really want to have fun with these `` poor souls just trying to eek out a living like anyone else '' just tie them up on the phone for a long time . They get paid by the number of calls they handle and the number of scams they pull off . So tie up their time and you can have a small passive-aggressive victory dance around the dinner table . Do n't yell or get angry at them . They 're already locked and loaded for those calls . Plus it will just get your adrenaline going and make you angry . Nothing good will come of that other than you being angry . They 're just going to call someone else and so on and so on . Just pretend like you care about what they 're saying and drag on their conversation for a long while.Other options for meddling with them are blasting a loud whistle or horn in the phone ( but some digital phones will cut out the loud noise . So that does n't always work . I 've also had success pretending to be a business when I see the caller ID and recognize the robocall area code ( NYC in this case ) . Once they realize it 's a business they called the operator will usually take you off the list because a business is n't engageable in a personal currency scam . In the end they 'll always be harrassing you as long as you have a phone ( like junk mail in your mailbox ) . Even if your number is unlisted these machines will randomly dial numbers at digital speeds . So do n't think the machines ca n't get through .	-1
This paper was not really of the high quality standards I have come to expect from Mead products in the past . While it is fine for it 's intended purpose and useable I find the thickness of the paper to be extremely thin and the lines on the backside of some of the pages from this pack were so faded I had trouble seeing them . Honestly , I expected better .	-1
120 days later the dialing function no longer works . Very poor quality construction . Too bad , this was a nice phone initially .	-1
When I got this product I realized it was extremely heavy and complex to put together . Not exactly what I thought I would be getting . Then unpacking I realized it took up a huge footprint on my limited desk space . This thing is just too big for a regular person 's desk and more fitting to be in some kind of industrial fabrication plant . Seriously , the design is old and not very useful . It 's also severely overpriced .	-1
This looked wonderful when I first saw it , I happen to like the sleek looking modern design ( much more in tune with our decorating then theClear Solutions Jumbo Cookbook Holdercookbook holder I 've been using . Yes I said cookbook holder , granted I realize this product is far from being advertised as a cookbook holder but I was hoping for something multipurpose . Cookbook holder , sheet music holder for practice times for my daughter and husband , document holder for my husband or myself , and reference book/sheet holder for our homeschooled daughter as we do n't need to use it for all those things at once I hoped this would function well for each as needed.Upon opening the box I was dumbfounded , I 'm a college educated adult who has fixed her own dryer and dishwasher along with assembling lots of furniture in our home and yet I stared at this lost , the directions ... well they just are n't . I had to go off of the images here online to get it together and I must still be doing something wrong since I 've almost put out my eye , my childs eye , and the dogs eye with the darn elastic strap part ... it keeps flying off the device and across the room.Also I realized this would be big , but you just do n't realize how big until it 's set up , and heavy . Great for holding down big books but not making it very moving friendly and between the band and weight not something I 'd consider using for my original idea of letting our little girl use it for reference books unless we set it up for her . I also find the band annoying , how it could be a line marker is beyond me as it 's not quick nor easy to move and it just ends up being in the way of text , leading to trying to pull it out of the way and ZOOOMMM off it goes across the room again : :sighs : :I think I 'm going to retire this to our desk for adult use only , making the retail and even amazon price crazy for what it will actually do for us . On a side note the before mentioned cookbook holder that I have is wonderful , lightweight but holds the biggest books with ease , nothing to fling off or put an eye out , and it folds up in seconds to store flat ... I highly recommend checking it out if you 're looking for something to hold books open ( being that it has no real back it would n't work well for documents only ) . I love 3M ( could you imagine life w/o sticky notes ? ) but I think they missed the bar on this one .	-1
This product weighs a ton , or at least way more than a document holder made for sheets of paper . Also , unless your monitor is well above the desk , anything you put in this will block the screen , plus you need room front to back room between your keyboard and monitor . Buy this only if you have the space and need the holder for heavy items . For papers ( e.g. , contracts , homework ) use a document holder that is longer top to bottom ( or tape the pages one at a time to a top corner of your monitor ) .	-1
3M ( TM ) Copy Holder , In-line , 18 Inches Wide , 300 Sheet Capacity , Black and ClearI am getting old . I remember when $ 100 ( $ 65 Amazon price ) actually bought something . Oh , wait , it still can . AppleTV is $ 100 . A Roku box is $ 100 . A Kindle is just $ 40 more . But , now in 2010 an 18 '' sheet of molded plastic two weighted plastic legs some assorted screws and knobs and a rubber band cost $ 100 . I have to assume the mystery weight beads in the legs are made of a high tech alloy and the plastic sheet must be bullet proof ? On top of that when assembled it 's kind of wobbly . I 'd have designed in a cross base support of some kind for rigidity . But , that might have driven the price up to $ 150 ? I did a quick search for a `` Copy Holder , '' what I found was a huge selection under $ 10 . Granted many were n't as attractive as the 3M product but what price design for such an item . It just needs to hold paper or a book.If the constructed product did n't feel as wobbly as it does , maybe I 'd forgive it . But , really , I ca n't get over the price to function ratio . I have many 3M products and many are well made and reasonably priced . I just ca n't review this product favorably . Your money is my concern . When you spend this much on a stationery product , it really should be beyond compare . This simply is not . There are better choices considering the price . If this was about $ 15- $ 20 maybe I 'd say it 's pretty and does the job . Yet , it 's still unsteady if you need to move it periodically . There are many better cost effective choices .	-1
A document holder that 's this wide ( wider than a keyboard , but not so wide I can slide mine under it when not in use ) might be expect to hold , say , a dictionary or a heavy cookbook . I would n't trust this one with a paperback . The vise grips on either leg do not hold the stand firmly no matter how much I tighten them . And the legs wobble . Adjusting the position is difficult and not in synch with both sides . The stretchy band stretches too much to hold some types of books ' pages flat . All in all , the design is just crappy.It looks nice and the individual pieces are solidly crafted . ( The heavy , wobbly legs have so far failed to snap the plastic rails off the sides , as physics might predict . ) There are apparently mounts for this that you can buy separately that screw into a surface . This might alleviate the wobble factor , although I hope those mounts use grips that actually keep the plastic from sliding down.Bottom line : A quick search on Amazon reveals a number of other document holders . Unless you like frustration , this is probably not the one you want .	-1
Useful but you need a big desk to find room for this ! Also , the price is too much for what you get . Also , kind of wobbly.I would not recommend this for the price . It should either be better designed or half the price . And I do n't mean half the list price ; I mean half the $ 60 Amazon price . And even that would be pushing it .	-1
This 3M Copy Holder is almost good ; half-baked design and cheesy construction make it a bad deal , even at amazon 's deep discount . ( The MSLP is absurdly high ! ) There are several different ways tobreak the copy area , as it is made of very thin transparent plastic . The legs are weighted , butwould be far more stable with some sort of crossbar installed between them ... this could certainlybe done by someone who is reasonably handy . The holding device is nothing but a thin elastic heldby two sliding plastic pieces which will also break easily . Replacing the elastic should n't be tough , which is good , because it 's definitely not going to stand up to heavy use- maybe not even light use.Replacing the two holders , though , is probably next to impossible . Why were n't some extras included ? It must be said that the few books and catalogs I used for testing were held open pretty well.This product is not designed for very thick books , however . It 's also not designed for long-termuse . Why pay this price for such an inadequate unit ? There must surely be better ones available.Those who need a sturdy copy holder for heavy duty everyday use are hereby urged to avoid this one.Shame on 3M for peddling this junk- one would expect far better from such a company ... right ?	-1
I do like the fact that this stand has adjustable angles but am taken aback by the price/design ratio . The way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it . The 3M engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product.The elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair , with two plastic attachments to it . For this price a few extras should have been included . I had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply can not handle the weight.Overall , it works ok , but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect .	-1
To me , this kit seems like a cheap product , overall . And an unnecessary one.You get a couple of very small microfiber cloths and a cheap tool made of foam rubber that has a material something like Velcro on one side ( that you scrub with ) and a U-shaped prong on each end . Apparently the prongs are for going between the keys on the keyboard . You also get a small bottle of cleaning fluid.I ca n't see where anyone really needs any of this . You 're better off using a damp cloth or something else . 3M ( if it 's the same company ) makes some other very good products . I 've used their wet or dry sandpaper over a period of years and it 's excellent . But I would n't recommend this particular product at all .	-1
Not so great , I do n't like this , it not do anything to your computer .bye bye no more buy for this	-1
I think they 're rotten , and they do n't begin to compare in quality with my earlier , bona fide Memorex CD labels . The reason I say they 're rotten is because the labels wo n't come off in one piece allowing me to center them very nicely on the CD/DVD , so it 's made it a lot more work for me !	-1
I tried this product and liked it very much , but tried to call Avery to gather more information on their products and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs ! ! ! On Avery 's web site they have their Consumer Service Center shown as Brea , California . I called the number listed ( 1-800-462-8379 ) and was given several choices of support . There is an option for templates and software , products , and all other issues . Any of the options you choose whether you 're calling from the US or Canada will route you to their `` call center '' in Manilla , Philippines . In addition , all of their products are manufactured in either Mexico or China , not Brea , California , USA . I am hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with any their products . It would be really nice if Avery was up-front on their web site and list their `` Consumer Service Center '' as Manilla ; o ) **************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the `` Consumer Service Center '' in Manilla : I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 to help me make the labels . It took some time to download and install , but well worth the time . The wizard was easy to use . I was able to use a big text size and printed the row of 5-tab labels quickly and easy.Once I had my labels printed out , I was able to lay down the row of tab sheets ( you can not do this if the tabs are already in the notebook ) , align , rub-down into place , and then peel away the outside edging . If you have a lot of tabs to make at once this product would be very helpful . You get 10 sets of 5-tab rows per sheet.On the other hand , I still like using the Avery 612797 tabs which has 80 tabs per sheet and better for times when you just need to print a couple tabs .	-1
To use this product , first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website . Not necessarily a bad thing , but a time drain if you 're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation . Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits . Again , another time drain . In my case , the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder , making it look as if there was any organization . This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs , which looked much better . I would not recommend this product at all .	-1
I am not impressed . Sure , if you manage to get it just right , your tabs will look gorgeous . But it is SO difficult to get right ! I would n't recommend these tabs ... old school dividers with tabs that you can either write on or print out label for are MUCH easier and more practical for most uses .	-1

I gave it 2 stars because it does not have a warning label.I had purchased this at another store and when I first used it I cut too much off the nozzle and spilled some on a trash bag . My cat started licking at it and had to take her to the vet because the bottle does not have any warning stickers . It turns out that the product is mostly vegetable oil and the worse that I would have to watch for is diarrhea in my cat.The product works really well but it is a danger to pets because of the oil 's sweet scent . I 'm only buying it again because it works great , is the same price as they other store , and because I now have my shredder protected from my cat . I strongly advise anyone who uses this product to keep their shredder covered if they have pets or something that may be attracted to the oil . Especially if it has an automatic turn on to protect your pet if they put their tongue in your shredder.Update** I was really upset when I tried writing this review . A better explanation is in my response to a user 's comment .	-1
I guess it does the job , but it sure is messy . I think I 'll just buy the paper that 's already treated to run through the machine next time .	-1
The point is , it 's a large bottle of oil that one is prompted to buy when purchasing a paper shredder . Then when you read the instructions on the shredder , you discover that a few drops of vegetable oil on a piece of paper and then fed into the shredder works just fine.This was a needless expenditure and now I 'm stuck with a fairly large bottle of lubricating oil that I have no use for .	-1
There was at least one reviewer who had indicated the price of this lubricant was reasonable . I am not sure he calculated its cost which is roughly $ 87.00 per gallon . At that price it may be cheaper to never lubricate your shredder and just replace it when it wears out . I am not advocating that you should not lubricate your shredder , but just plain motor oil will be nearly as good and a lot cheaper considering that you can lubricate many items in your home by using an inexpensive oil can filled with inexpensive motor oil . Some may want to use a light grade in one can and a heavier grade in another , but you can save yourself a lot of money over the years by not buying `` special purpose '' lubricants when they are not really needed . Of course you would want to use higher priced synthetic oils like Mobil One in your Ferarri or Mercedes that is required for their warranty , but even that standard for high performance engines is still more than 10 times cheaper than this `` Shredder Oil '' . Decisions on the use of certain types of oil are not going to make or break you , I am just suggesting putting such small decisions into perspective . Its similar to the example of the guy who buys a new car every two years and trades his old one in , but he will change his engine oil every 3,000 miles because that 's what his father told him to do . The only reason for changing the oil so often is if you are selling your car to your father who will keep it for years.In conclusion , if it makes you feel better using the `` special $ 87.00 per gallon shredder oil '' I think you should do so . But you may want to acknowledge that at least some of your decision is based upon how you feel as opposed to how you think .	-1
I paid $ 6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder ... . WHAT BUNK ! ! No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil , but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area ! ! Not that $ 6 is a lot of money , but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together , when they can not be , especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations . FALSE ADVERTISING basically .	-1
The only reason I bought this product is because of the bottle . I could not find a bottle with a long nozzle in my area . I 'll be refilling the bottle with cheap vegetable oil . I could n't even find this product in local office supply stores . The only thing I could find was a pack of ten sheets of paper impregnated with soybean oil for $ 9.99 . I left the store in a huff that somebody would even think of charging that kind of money for soybean oil . There is simply no need for it .	-1
Originally , I have written a good review : `` I have got this thing to use in the office , I like my feet elevated . It has two height settings , so it is even more convenient than it looks . I personally like it a lot . `` However after just a couple months of using this thing , I pierced it with my heel very easily , and I did n't put a lot of weight on it . It 's very fragile and wo n't work for girls in heels . Very disappointed .	-1
The white board part of it may be nice , but no matter how hard I tried and tightened the locks , the back leg would slip out.I could not get it to stand up while writing on it.I do n't think the plastic locks are strong enough . Maybe mine is defective , but I 'm guessing , it is just poor design .	-1
this came bent and just warped looking . When siting on a desk it takes up waaay too much space , but I suppose mounted on a wall it would be more useful . I just seems so large , bulky and not very convenient .	-1
It 's ok if you want to trim off some excess . But you have to hold the paper very still or the blade will pull it toward the end of the cut . There is no guide , so cutting multiple pieces can be time consuming.I 'm really disappointed in that if I cut a sheet in half and truly want to use both pieces , it partially bends the piece of paper to the right of the blade . I do n't like that at all .	-1
When I first got theSwingline ClassicCut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmera couple years ago , I was pretty happy with it . I used it mostly for cutting coupons and various craft projects , nothing really over the top.Unfortunately , the product is not very durable for the long run . There are also some safety issues with this product . In use , the unit would lift off the table during cutting . Considering how razor sharp the blade is , this could lead to a serious problem . While I appreciate that this product is lightweight and ultra-portable , this seems to be a contributing factor to this problem . The product also lacks the ability to adjust the edge , thus you may have a harder time getting uniform cuts most of the time . Sometimes the cuts can look uneven and really sloppy.Being made of plastic , the unit has worn over time and I 've started to see cracks in the workmanship . It would have been nicer to see this product made from something more durable like metal . It does n't happen to often , but sometimes the unit snags the paper and rips it . This is mostly in the middle but does n't happen too often . For a long term investment , I would not recommend this cutter .	-1
When the package arrive , all of the pins literally poured to the ground . The box was broken and so were some of the pins ! ! There was ABSOLUTELY NO packaging or protection in the box.For almost $ 9 , this is a total rip off ! !	-1
This product may be fine enough , but the storage process clearly was n't . The binder clips were entwined in elaborate , deep webbing , which I thought might be some kind of strange packaging . Nope . As I tried to pull back the thick white sheet on the clips , there appeared an enormous spider ... the kind of thing you see only in a few places in the U.S. Never again will I buy an Acco product ; I 'd be too terrified of what might appear in the box.I have no idea about the product , as I obviously threw out the box , giant spider , ocean of spider-killer , and all .	-1
Okay , so these business cards are n't all that expensive , but if you can afford to spend about $ 12 knowing that only about 60 of the cards will print well enough to actually be used , well , kudos.First things first , I have a really nice printer . My ink cartridge is brand-new . Yet any sort of image I tried to print came out fuzzy . One of the designs that I tried never dried properly ( even after sitting out in the air for half an hour after being printed ) . So I tried using just text , but the first two cards on the page would print in the proper font and the rest would revert to the default font ! That brings me to the Avery.com templates - do n't bother , they do n't work . No matter how many times I realigned , played with my image and text layouts , etc . - the first two cards would print okay , and the rest would be a disaster . I bought these cards despite the bad reviews that stated exactly what I found in regards to the templates and problems with printing them , thinking `` hey , I 'm pretty good with computers/printers/technology in general , I 'll be able to figure it out '' . Nope , nope , nope . Go to VistaPrint or a similar site and print a couple hundred business cards for $ 20 . It 's worth it .	-1
Or maybe not for my computer ? ? ? However , if I 'm having problems , there may be others out there who would experience the same frustration.My opinion may not be fair , because the trouble I had could be related to my PC . I have never attempted to make my own business cards before , but I have been able ( without any training ) to make some basic projects with Publisher , such as gift certificates . I routinely do flyers that require clip art . So I did n't expect to have any problem with this Avery product.Avery DOES supply a contact number you can call to get help , but frankly I really dislike getting instructions over the phone , so I did not take advantage of this offer . I would have preferred some trouble shooting tips listed online or on a sheet of paper in the packet.First , I had trouble downloading the template . I gave up after eight tries in three different sessions . I finally settled for the totally blank card setup that I was able to get access to . I could not get the program to accept clip art most of the time . I had trouble getting one of the seven lines to center . When I finally was able to paste clip art onto the card , I could not control where it went AND all the copy I had set up disappeared ... never to be seen again . Some day ... many months from now , I may come back and try this again . Or I may give the product away and let someone else struggle with it . For now , I have a lot of wasted time and no business cards to show for it .	-1
I like the clean edge cards . The only thing I do n't like doing , and I 've had to do this on other busincess card paper , was to trim the edges with a cutter . Every time . The calibration did n't work for me and I followed the instructions as written.If you do n't mind having to trim them further , than what you need , either that , or do n't use any color near the edges . Because you may get a white strip that has to be cut .	-1
I expected better from Avery . They are okay - but pages do not slide in easily - it seems like it will work better for smaller pages ...	-1
My prior boss opened a REC Center for kids with special needs . I purchased this velcro with high hopes . I was so excited to utilize the clear velcro for communication books . Unfortunately , the velcro barely stuck to surfaces and the hard and soft velcro barely stuck to each other . I was embarrassed by this purchase .	-1
While the idea of using something environmentally friendly appeals to me , this item is not manufactured well . I put them together as I have every other box like this , and the ones I had absolutely did not stand up to use . I put my files in ( which honestly were n't very heavy ) and the box could n't take it . I ran out and bought the original ones and they held up fine . I definitely do not recommend these !	-1
I needed an accordion file folder for my classroom to handily file extra papers , assignments , handouts , lecture notes etc . on a daily basis . The ColorLife Expanding File caught my eye , as blue is my school 's color . On both of those criteria ( filing , and color ) the Wilson Jones gets an & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; . However , in one area it falls short.The velcro closure is w-a-a-a-y to tight . Opening the file necessitates bending the top , yanking the top , pulling the top - all resulting in some frustration and creases in the top . I just leave it open . I understand that the velcro strip was placed fairly high to accommodate the file as it expands . But if you simply use this as I do , for relatively few documents at a time , the shallow file results in maximum velcro attachment and frustration.This would have resulted in the file being a 3-star product . But the amazon selling price of $ 18.95 is simply too steep for this quality , resulting in the subtraction of one star , and a 2-star rating.Disappointing .	-1
This blue cardboard accordion file folder is okay . Completely function for what it is - an expanding storage unit for limited amounts of paperwork . There 's a folder for most letters of the alphabet , with a few doubling up - a total of twenty folders . This is n't something you 'd want to overstuff , simply because it 's not the sturdiest unit of its kind . The closeable flap is embarrassingly thin and prone to tearing as a result.The main issue with this product is that you do not get a very good value for your money . For this price , you 'd think Wilson Jones could 've made the file out of thin plastic rather than bendable , wearable , rip-able cardboard .	-1
Eight-page tabbed dividers can be surprisingly expensive , so this set can be a frugal choice as long as you are aware of its limitations.The multicolored tabs are of sturdy , semi-transparent plastic . The cardstock inserts are similarly rugged . However , the 8.5x11 dividers themselves are surprisingly flimsy . Although the weight of the stock is n't specified , it is comparable to multipurpose laser-printer paper . Even worse , the reinforcements surrounding the ring punch-outs -- the portions of each page subject to the greatest and most frequent stress -- have very little reinforcement.The portion of this eight-page set I used daily -- and gently -- lasted less than a week before tearing . The dime-store version I used in the rest of that binder survived much better , although the tab clarity was less satisfactory . The remaining pages of the set have survived about five weeks ' delicate and infrequent use , but there 's obvious wear at the site of the rings.Bottom line , if you are considering these for routine school or office use , keep looking . They are acceptable only for one- or maybe two-inch binders that receive just occasional use .	-1
This is a very basic set of dividers , the sort you would use in a school binder to separate your notes for each subject . I needed something like this for a binder of printed sewing technique articles -- -I wanted to divide them according to type : zippers , pockets , embroidery , etc.PROS* It will keep your papers or notes separated within a binder . * There are eight colored tabs , so you can assign a different color to each subject , like red for Math , green for Geography , yellow for Literature , and so forth . ( Hooray for color coordination ! ) In theory , the tabs stick out beyond your papers , so you can easily flip to the section you want.CONS* Remember that theory I just mentioned about the tabs sticking out ? Yeah . In reality , they do n't . Maybe if you 're only dividing notepaper , but I have a bunch of binder pockets that hold my articles . The tabs do NOT stick out past the edges of the binder pockets , so they 're virtually worthless . * These dividers are incredibly flimsy . They 're made from a slightly-thicker-than-usual paper . You do n't even get cardstock , just thick paper , with a narrow section that 's barely reinforced at the holes . I ca n't imagine they would hold up under gentle home use , never mind what a busy student would put them though . I certainly would n't use them without reinforcing each hole with some of those round stickers you can buy for repairing torn holes . Of course , those are ugly . . . . * Also , the tabs are very small . It comes with a sheet of perforated labels that you can hand write your subject title on , but they 're tiny . Personally , I would have a hard time writing the labels.I 'm giving this product two stars , because it 's barely functional . If you need something ultra cheap and flimsy , it will work just fine . But if you need something more substantial , I 'd suggestAvery Style Edge Insertable Plastic Dividers , 8-Tab Set . They 're only slightly more money , yet a lot sturdier and they look nicer , too .	-1
These dividers are pretty basic . They have plastic tabs which you can insert custom labels into ( though you have to write on them by hand or create your own custom template without any help from the manufacturer ) . The dividers are not particularly thick nor thin and they do have a somewhat reinforced edge . They are essentially quite basic . This is not necessarily a problem , but you can get a slightly better set of 8 dividers made by Avery with color tabs from OfficeMax for $ 1.39 . This set is $ 2.56 at present . The Avery ones have a better system for holding the color plastic tabs , better reinforcement along the edge , and a system for making sure the tabs do n't fall out . If you 're making a big order on Amazon for office supplies and do n't want to buy separate dividers , then it probably would n't hurt to pile this into an order , but , if you shop around , you can do better .	-1
I bought a new home office chair that turned out to have an uncomfortable seat . I bought this cushion , thinking it would be as comfortable as my memory foam mattress . Not close . Not only was there no noticeable change in comfort , this pad is unusually small -- not really standardized for the average work or dining chair . I suppose they have to size it to fit the smallest seat , but it really missed the mark .	-1
I have seen several incredibly comfortable office chairs for about $ 25 . Who would pay this for a chair pillow ?	-1
I really should have returned it earlier . It is like sitting on a rock and hurts like heck . I do n't recommend this for anyone but a featherweight ... and yes like everyone else mine says in bold letters ASTAR . At first it was good but as the weeks go on it gets worse i.e . harder and harder . Stay AWAY .	-1
The `` original '' old Mead Composition Book is a classic . But recently Mead changed the Composition Book so that it 's now worthless . The paper seems like it is n't 100 % pure quality tree paper so it 's not as smooth to write on , the cover is a messy `` plastic-type '' cardboard , the black tape comes off in 3 months . I hate these things now.I bought 50 of these `` new type '' Mead Composition Books and the 10 new ones that I still have left , have rotted and the black tape has warped and come off . The 40 that I used up with writing , have also rotted and the black tape has come off . It 's a real mess if you store them in old bookshelves . Some are made in India or Brazil and none are no longer made in the USA . The USA ones were the absolute best , with real tree paper , not `` plastic-wax type '' mesh waste paper , and real tree cardboard covers.If you need fairly adequate paper to write on , get Japanese Stationery ( ex : Apica Notebooks ) , Rhodia , Rediform DaVinci Notebooks , Leuchtturm Notebooks , Black n ' Red Notebooks , or Clairefontaine , they 're very good and of high quality . The paper is of a high standard.Also , Moleskine Cahier Large Ruled Notebook ( set of 3 ) and Writersblok Medium Ruled Notebook ( set of 3 ) , are good substitutes , of higher quality , for the Mead Black Composition Book if you 're a writer like I am . It costs more but if you 're a writer who needs decent paper to write on , it 's well worth it.If you 're just using the Mead Black Composition Book for school notes , doodling or odd ends , it 's at least useable with a good pen.The `` original '' old Mead Composition Book did n't need to be changed .

The plastic protective slip over the holes on the papers falls off , leaving the paper vulnerable to being torn.Absolute waste of money . DO NOT BUY this !	-1
I liked the old Bic ball point pens because the ink never smeared and the pens did n't leak in my purse , backpack , or bag . If I accidentally marked my clothes , the ink would wash right out . The new gel versions smear , leak , and leave a horrible mess in my purse . It does n't wash out of clothes either . Threw them away .	-1
I found that these pens did not write well . I would not recommend them even for a filler item as often I find air bubbles in the ink and have to scribble several times while I am writing . These went in the trash .	-1
I 'm a writer and handwrite all my books so I 've used many brands of pens over the years , including other types of Bic pens , and at first I was impressed with these . The color was consistent , the pen was lightweight , and they write smooth every time . I often forget to put the caps back on these and they 've never dried out nor have I needed to scribble on a piece of scrap paper to get the ink flowing.However , after using them for a few days , I started to notice that there were constant ink globs that I had to keep wiping off the end of the tip or risk smearing what I was writing . I had to keep a tissue next to me while writing so I could wipe off the end every few minutes ! Not only that , but the ink kept staining my fingers when a small glob would come off the end and it is VERY hard to get this ink off skin . It even got under my fingernail , which is even harder to wash off . Aside from the constant globs and stained fingers , these pens also need comfort grips . Bottom line , splurge on some more expensive pens that you do n't have to keep wiping off ! These are going in the trash !	-1
If you are a fan of soft feel retractable pens , you will probably like these ones . They work fine.But have you tried their older cousin , the classic BiC Cristal Stics ( and I mean *classic , * like 1959 classic ) ? They are cheap-looking , ultra-simple pens , so they may not have graced your hand if you ( like me ) thought that a pen needs to be `` soft feel '' or `` rubber gripped '' to be comfortable . But then you 'd be ( like I was ) missing the genius of these pens.The classic BiC 's were designed exceptionally , like bizarrely well . And I do n't mean in a quaint , historical way . In a modern way -- no , in a *timeless* way -- the classic BiC 's adhere magnificently to principles of space , form , structure , density , and gravity . Because of their hexagonal shape , they require minimal plastic while also retaining a surprising strength ( try snapping one ) , and the hexagonal grip points give the pens impressive writing stability . A tiny hole drilled in the barrel 's body keeps the air pressure the same both inside and outside the pen . Gravity feeds the thick ink down a tube to a free-spinning ball bearing that was manufactured within a fraction of a micron of accuracy . The result is that when the pen is pressed against paper , the ink slides out cleanly and , well , ... perfectly . It 's not only one of the most inexpensive pens ( less than $ 1.50 for a pack of 10 ) , it 's also probably the most efficient pen , with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words ( or about 2 novels ) . Hopefully this helps you understand why , when describing the classic BiC 's , I am comfortable using the word `` masterpiece . `` And hopefully this helps you understand why , in comparison , clunky and over-designed `` soft feel '' pens seem somewhat repulsive.Sorry if I come off as a pen snob .	-1
Writes well . My impression when I first wrote with it was that it was really smooth.Maybe it 's the wideness and grip that dampens the writing compared to a full plastic , thin stick pen ? But this thing , the Bic Soft Feel , has a major problem . The thing is press fitted together instead of screwed . So the tip slides itself into the barrel as you 're writing and you have press the two halves of the barrel back into each other after every 3 words you write.I guess you could super glue it together ... and perhaps not all of them have this problem ... but that 's my experience and it 's totally unacceptable.Update : No , they all have the automatic disintegration feature .	-1
It 's easy to fall in love with the Pilot V5 if you have never used a fluid rollerball before . The ink flows out so readily , and it maintains a steady output until it dies . But those two features are true of almost any fluid rollerball ( fluid rollerballs having a free-flowing ink tank , not a marker-style sponge pressed against the back side of the ball ) .Aside from having chosen to make a pen in that category , Pilot is n't offering anything special here . The ball tip is among the crudest on the market , and no description of its construction could include the words `` quality '' or `` precision '' . Much like the BIC Triumph , the V5 ensures ink flow through its poorly-manufactured tip by using a very loose , rattling ball . It is n't just noisy , it has an inconsistent feel against the paper.If you like rollerball pens , and particularly if you like the V5 , try a Uni-Ball Vision instead ( a series with several models ) . Uni-Ball 's Vision series uses a fluid ink system much like the V5 , but produces free-flowing ink by using a ball tip which is manufactured accurately . It feels smoother , makes much less noise , and has a more stable tip which is less prone to wiggling and bending .	-1
I purchased a set of these pens at Target roughly a week ago.When I am writing with this pen it has an inconsistent flow of ink , half way through a work it & # 34 ; dries up & # 34 ; the next work it runs dark , and repeats this process . I have tried both pens and have the same issue . Regardless if I use more/less pressure , change the angle , write on different paper.The pen writes poorly . Would not recommend or purchase these.Still searching for that perfect pen ...	-1
Just not a fan of big , oversized , wide-body pens . If you have hands like frying pans , then this may be your pen . On the plus side , I do like the rubber grip , and the fact that the pen takes the G2 Ultra-Fine gel refill . The click action is very smooth and solid .	-1
I love the ultra fine point of these refills , but I think the tips may just be too small . After about two weeks , both of the pens stopped working . The heads got clogged and I could n't use either of them . I now use the .05 pens and they 're great . They write about the same and the difference in the two is n't worth it for me .	-1
I needed a sharpener at home for my kids and the various sizes of pencils they use . This thing is good in theory , but poor in practice . Every single pencil that is sharpened in this machine comes out with one side sharpened , one side pointed wood . A big disappointment . I paid more for mine than here on Amazon.I also tried battery operated kind made by the same company ... not enough power . Now I am looking at the grand daddy of pencil sharpeners ... electric ! I think I will skip the X acto brand though .	-1
Very slim pencil , hard to hold and slippery . The lead point keeps breaking , and the quality is clearly lacking . As a comparison , I ordered the Pilot G-2/07 mini mechanical pencils from Amazon , and they are GREAT . Do n't waste your money on this product , and buy the Pilots instead .	-1
These pencils used to be great . Now they must be made with some kind of plastic or something in them -- they feel weird , smell weird , and do n't even sharpen right . How does a pencil company get THAT wrong ?	-1
They seem well made , but as you try to sharpen them , the lead breaks . The first one I sharpened took me down to half the length to get it to not break , but only because I did not sharpen it to the tip . I was using a hand-held sharpener , so maybe trying a different type will yield different results .	-1
After reading reviews of the Paper Mate Mirado , I was looking forward to a good quality wood pencil . The first pencil out of the box sharpened without issue . The graphite is smooth ... not too hard and not too soft , just right . The eraser works well , although the real test is whether it stays supple over time.However , when I sharpened the second pencil , the tip kept breaking off without ever achieving a point . Each time it broke , I checked the sharpener to make sure it was not clogged . After 4 or 5 broken tips , the pencil never reached a point.Then I figured out the problem . The graphite is not in the center of the wood . Therefore , that pencil ca n't be sharpened , except maybe free-hand.However , the tip of another pencil kept breaking . That one sharpened OK , but I can see that the wood around the lead is uneven.I like the smoothness of the lead , but the sharpening and breaking tips are too problematic . Not sure if I received a bad batch or if the box was dropped in transit.PROS : - Smooth writing tip- Eraser seems good so far- Reasonable priceCONS : - Tip of the pencil with a non-centered graphite keeps breaking.- Another pencil tip keeps breaking .	-1
These would be ok , but do n't really like the grip of the black part of the pencil . Too soft for me !	-1
This is the electric pencil sharpener issued by the Seattle School District to all classrooms . After three years , the experience taught me to appreciate the manual ones that were used by teachers for decades . Here is a listing of my complaints : .1 . It chews up pencils fast..2 . It breaks down after a one year usage..3 . The District buys it at $ 25 each and provides one for every classroom . When it breaks down , the building suppose to buy replacements . Unfortunately because of reduced budgets , none are ever purchased . As a result , teachers use their own money and buy traditional manual pencil sharpeners . They are cheaper , durable , and more reliable than this electrical power device .	-1
I 'm a third-year law student , which pretty much means I 'm an expert on highlighters . These highlighters dried out pretty quickly compared to other brands , like Sharpie and hi-liters . I did like these better than some others because I did n't have a hard time reading the text under the coloring , unlike some brands ( eg the blue and green in the Sharpie brand ) .	-1
I do n't expect highlighters to be super florescent but these do n't even make an attempt . Green and blue are way to dark and make the highlighted text difficult to read .	-1
These used to work great on textbooks , for highlighting a whole row of text ( not just underline , but solidly through the text ) . But after the chisel tip , it is too wide to highlight a row of text . Using the side of the tip , then it is too thin . The old style of these highlighters did n't have the chisel tip , and the side of the tip is just perfect for textbooks . Now I have to use the pen-style liquid accent highlighters ( [ ... ] ) , and they run out very quickly , and they cost one dollar each , instead of 59 or 69 cents big ones which could last several time longer than the pen-style ones .	-1
I usually use the same brand and model , but the yellow highlighter . I wanted to get this green one so I can differentiate between main ideas/categories and sub-ideas in my textbook , unfortunately , my pen scanner gives me errors with the green highlights . Does n't matter if I underline with it , or highlight the line completely with it . I believe it is too dark of a green which causes these errors . Thankfully , it only affected 1 chapter in which I tried it with . I guess I 'll have to try a lighter color .	-1
the highlighting is so weak from these highlighters they are essentially unusable . Considering that Sharpie is usually the best brand for markers , I suspect these are drying out from shelf life . I should have sent them back but was too overwhelmed by other pressures .	-1
The rings crush easily on this . I bought it because my son needed a two inch three ring binder for sixth grade . He 's not particularly tough on his school supplies , but this survived less than one month .	-1
As one of those people who `` thumb through '' my folders , I like the reinforcement along the top 1 '' edge of these folders . It keeps the folders standing up straight , for better visibility.But these folders ... .I 've never seen such a mess . I thought I was imagining things when I noticed they were n't sitting uniformly in my folders . Now that I take them all out and look at them from several angles , I see that these folders are not all the same height ! In fact , only one third of them are all the same height . The rest are within a 1/4 inch of each other up or town.Two folders are very roughly cut , which might indicate the `` cutter '' was off on the assembly line . Or they have n't gotten all the kinks worked out for this product.As it is , I 've wasted a sheet of labels and must re-start a tedious job . I will give away these folders , as they are unusable for my purposes.Even if they had n't been defective , I was shocked by how flimsy the paper is .	-1
I use a LOT of file folders on the job , so I have become somewhat of an file folder aficionado . : - ) Pros : - Wire Fastener are well made/sturdy- Tabs at top of folder are reinforced ( paper is doubled over and glued down well ) - Bright colors- 3 tab positions in every colorCons : - VERY thin folders ! I was expecting MUCH thicker material for the price . These are on the thinner side of EVERY file folder I 've used at different prices.- Thinness of folder makes the fasteners more prone to ripping the folder , especially if you flip the papers that are fastened up ( i.e. , if you 're reading the BOTTOM page , the folder becomes very unstable , bends , or can rip ) - Must use on a desk or table -- folder is so thin that you 'll likely need to put it on a desk or table to flip through the fastened-on papers , because the folder is n't strong enough to be stable if you 're standing up while reading the bottom few pages . The whole folder can bend over or even rip the fastening clip off of the folder if you flip the paper up to read something.Overall , I was disappointed . I have never , ever seen fastening-clip style folders like this made out of such a THIN material ! They would be perfectly fine for folders that are rarely used ... though in my experience , people generally want fastening folders like this for HEAVILY used folders , or folders that are moved around a lot , read through while standing at the filing cabinet , etc ... and these wo n't hold up to much use at all . Why take the extra time to clip everything in place so carefully , if the folder is just going to rip on you ? ` These are fine for 'file and forget about it ' files , but I think people generally are n't bothering to punch holes and clip documents in unless they intend to use that file quite a bit/carry it around with them . These wo n't stand up to much of ANY use , let alone heavy abuse ! They would be great if they 'd only bothered to use a halfway decent , heavier weight paper/cardboard to make the folder out of . Or at least they could have reinforced the cardboard around the area of the fastener ( as they did on the tab ) . Only order these if they 're very inexpensive AND you only intend to put rarely used files in them .	-1
Quality is not too great . Not that sturdy and stong . It feels kind of like regular paper . However , it still gets the job done .	-1
While this tape is a tiny bit thicker than the standard Scotch packaging tape , I ca n't see that it is really worth the higher price . As with all new products , I like to try them out exactly how the directions say before doing things my way , and the directions for repairing a paperback book are pretty much useless . The tape rips easily , so trying to make precision cuts with a normal pair of scissors was basically impossible for me to do without the tape simply ripping the whole way across . What `` tabs '' did manage to not tear off were of no use repairing the book in question , so I quickly abandoned the suggested way and did my own thing . I am thoroughly not impressed with the product and am very disappointed in its quality , especially considering the price .	-1
We recently remodeled a room which included painting and since I had this tape to try I gave it a go even though we normally use Frog Tape . Application was easy enough , but when it came time to remove it after painting it was a disaster . Not only did some of it stick which made it very difficult to remove small pieces , it also bled underneath . I would have tried using it again , but the once was frustrating enough . So while there are other good uses for this tape , I 'm sure ; painting is not one of them and I would discourage it .	-1
By far one of the strongest fulfillment tapes I 've ever used . My only issue -- I had to change the blade in my tape gun in order to cut it , and even with a new blade , if I did n't cut it cleanly on the first attempt , I had to grab a scissors.Edit : Not long after I originally reviewed this tape , I put together a box that I ended up not using . Not wanting to cut the tape to refold the box for storage , I just left it sit taped-up . Well , today I needed to use that box.Unfortunately what I found is that the tape was curling-up , and not fully adhering to the box any longer . It 's a bad thing when a shipping tape does n't permanently stick to cardboard , so I need to downgrade my rating.My advice is to make sure any place you use this tape on the box , you encircle the box so the tape can adhere to itself . Do not expect it to adhere very well to the cardboard .	-1
The 1 '' wide scotch magic tape I wanted has a 3 '' diameter core . This dispenser is for tape with a 1 '' diameter core . I had to buy a more expensive 3 '' diameter office dispenser ( which I really like )	-1
I purchased my first Scotch tape dispenser in 1974 and it lasted for 37 years . It was built like a rock- solid composition , almost as heavy as marble.This item cracked and started to spill out sand after it was bumped on the countertop . It is constructed of 2 pieces of lightweight plastic glued together with sand inside to weigh the dispenser down.I only paid 2.50 for the item , no big loss , but I would of preferred a more durable unit even if it costs more .	-1
This tape dispenser is not heavy . One can not remove tape without holding the dispenser . Fortunately , I have one that is 40 years old that IS heavy . Do n't buy this one no matter how inexpensive it is .	-1
The design of these particular tapes is such that if you have text in more than one line , such as I do on my desk calendar , and try to use it directly underneath the line you just & # 34 ; whited out & # 34 ; the plastic on the dispenser will scrape off what you just covered . For me this is a deal breaker as it completely undermines the purpose that I had in mind when I purchases it .	-1
I picked up several of these when they were on sale because they were BIC . The first one was nothing but a pain , and the tape kept breaking , much like a cassette tape and just as useless afterward ( for those of us who remember cassettes ) . I thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular one , but I 've been through all of them , and they were all just as bad . If I managed to make it halfway through without the tape breaking , the white stuff began to flake off the clear film on most of them also rendering them useless . As much as I put the fluid type corrector at the bottom of my list , I 'd rather use that than use these again . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I 've bought 4 of these now , and each one has malfunctioned after one or two uses . Nor am I able to put the things back together because they are so cheaply made . I will never buy another Bic Wite-out again , nor do I reccommend you waste your money . Wite-out never responds to complaints either .	-1
Poor new design , it breaks , it has no screw for rewind . Tombo Mono is a better brand , it still has the screw for rewind . Bic has no way to open or adjust the tape .	-1
I use a lot of colored ink for my math homework notes and needed some correction tape so I blindly bought this off amazon for the good reviews.There were too many times where the tape would actually rip and shred while trying to use it . It would do this so much that I would go off on a tangent and try to go over the same spot again and again and again trying to get all the tape to work properly which it rarely did.I went to a local store to see if any other brands of correction tape was available and found a blue colored BIC correction tape . It worked beautifully . Very smooth and proper function where the tape does n't shred and starts where you want it on the paper.I definitely recommend the BIC brand over this one . Save yourself the pain .	-1
I returned it twice , thinking that it was just a lemon ... but this brand is not good . Find another brand instead .	-1
Have 2 kids going through the schools . I wish I 'd thought of looking for these erasers in Amazon before they went through endless packs of Staples erasers . These are actually better . They erase well . No glazing or becoming smudged . Tighter fit on the pencils as well.4-25-2014 edit : After a few months . Some of the erasers are splitting down the middle . It is happening to at least 1 out of 3 erasers . Am I or my kids bearing down on it too much ? Maybe . But it is laughable to have to walk on eggshells to use the eraser . There is still a boxful left . Will see what happens with the rest of them.These erasers do not deserve only 2 stars ( my choice would be 3 ) , but I put it there where it will not be lost in the 5 star reviews . Buyers be aware .	-1
This listing was posted as a pack ( of 12 ) sharpies , but was shipped as single sharpies . When customer support was contacted , they reported that Amazon made the listing mistake and they ( the company ) were not responsible for this error . The quality of the items were good , but overall this was a terrible experience .	-1
I 've been trying to mark corrugated boxes for storage and the chisel point creates and inconsistent line on a corrugated box . I 'm sure it would be beautiful on poster board , but I do n't need it for that . I used to do calligraphy so I do n't really think I have a problem with skill with a chisel point . A lot of people use these markers for boxes and I would like to see the nice , neat lettering I 'm actually writing with . I 've been using Sharpie King Size markers for years without a bit of trouble and I guess you ca n't get then now without the chisel point . So , back to Marks-A-Lot .	-1
These pens have a nice fine permanent point . I use them in my artwork . BUT they stop working FAST , get clogged or skip frequently -- so I ordered this well priced BOX anticipating that . On my first use , the pen quit working in 5 minutes . It got clogged or ? , as there was no way I used up all the ink that fast . I had to keep sucking ink out with an absorbing kleenex to get ink flowing again . I like the permanent ink line -- but it is a hassle for artwork . when writing , if you angle the tip for a normal writing position , it does n't work too well either.The design could use some work . *update July 2013 : EVERY SINGLE pen stopped working within HOURS of opening it . They run DRY , skip , and are generally a royal pain . NEVER will buy these again . I think they are cheap because somebody got old stuff to re-sell . WHY else would every pen go dry in a matter of hours , capped or not ? BUY something else ! Aloha	-1
runny ; ca n't control ink spreading into surrounding spaces , would return if I had the packaging	-1
I was very disappointed with the plastic this is made from . If you were to open a box of cookies , the plastic in that is just as thick . It has one thin strip of double sided tape on the back to mount it . We returned ours and bought a magnetic basket to hold the markers . It cost less and was much nicer .	-1
I was really suprised that Swingline would make such a cheap product . First off I thought that the look of it was nice-it has a shiny look to it but then when I touched it I realized that it was made of some sort of cheap plastic . And even worse-when I loaded it with staples it kepts jamming . I tried using it for 2 , 5 , 10 and 15 pages ( it claims that it can handle up to 15 per staple ) and each time it jammed up even two pages ! I had to use a stapler removal to get the mangled staple out of my documents.Spend a little more and get one that wo n't jam as much as this piece of junk did ! Skip !	-1
I have a Swingline Standard Stapler and have had it in my office for a number of years . It was cheap and looked nice but has n't worked nearly as well as the older , cruder model it replaced . Although looking rather attractive it is nowhere nearly as sturdy as my previous stapler . It jams off and on and sometimes gets the staple stuck to where it requires a pliers to remove it . It works fairly well with up to six pages , but beyond that it struggles . I would not regard it as a quality office instrument . There are better staplers available , although they might cost more.Gary Peterson	-1
This is your standard stapler , with biodegradable plastic , treated with Microban , and takes standard size staples . It 's lightweight . However , the first time the top was opened for loading staples and somehow the loading spring broke . So- I 've never been able to actual use it because the spring that holds the staples in place just & # 34 ; floats & # 34 ; back and forth without tension . Very disappointing .	-1
I am generally a huge fan of swingline products , but this stapler is not the best out there . It is budget friendly which is a plus , lightweight and ergonomic made with 50 % recycled plastics so its a bit greener than others on the market . We use it at the office daily , it works pretty well with two sheet stapling , which is what we use it for primarily . But , when you go to 8-10 pages it jams although it is supposed to do 15 . Overall a bummer as the price is very economical .	-1
It seems like these staplers are getting more flimsy each year . This one has very light weight plastic and very lightweight metal . When you pick it up , it feels like a very low quality product . I did not get good results with it and am not happy with it . I would suggest spending a little more and getting a more solidly built model .	-1
I bought this because it says pink . What i received is not pink . It is not the purple one , either . The part number is correct , but it is in between and very close to a purple sort of magenta . It 's not anything like the picture , and , yes , my monitor is color-calibrated so do n't blame it on my screen . If you are looking for pink , pass on this item .	-1
The following 4-star paragraph , written in January 2012 , has been edited into past tense to reflect both this product 's potential and its incredibly short lifespan : This little bitty stapler had a lot going for it : Came with its own little box of 1,000 green-colored staples that fit all standard-size staplers . Came in two very loud colors so that , tiny though it was , it would have been easy to find on even the messiest desk . Plus which , it came with a key chain attached . And attached to the key chain was a belt hook , which I hooked onto my pencil jar , making it easy to find amid clutter . I 'd have much preferred to choose my own color combination from Swingline 's pretty good selection ; would have gladly paid a buck or two more if given that option , especially since the one they sent me is yellow & orange , which would have been my absolute last choice had I had one . Also , it arrived from the Amazon outside seller just a couple of days after I ordered it.UPDATE 3/2/12 : Quit working after 30 days . Spent two days trying to get it to release a staple . Could n't do it . So came back here and deducted two of its original four stars . And then discovered I was not alone in all this . Ah , well . You get what you pay for , I guess . And mostly what I got was about 950 green staples that can be used in my not-cute-but-nonetheless-functional stapler .	-1
I had hoped this would help opening the volumes of business mail we get daily . While it works good on a lot of things , unfortunately it cuts whatever the contents is way too frequently so I have to take the time to tape whatever it is back together . I have to be cautious what I open with it so not to destroy any critical documents . It opens the envelope ok but by cutting off way too much of the envelope creating this problem . I would not re-order for business purposes which is unfortunate because it was priced good and it is very portable .	-1
I bought this set of pens expecting them to write for a while before they dried up . One pen out of a dozen wrote , and then only for a short time . It 's like they had been out in the sun or something and just dried up . I have never shipped anything back to Amazon , but these I returned . I quickly got a credit for the return ; I was impressed with the speed of the return and the fact I did n't have to pay return shipping . Thanks Amazon for making good on a product that could have been a good one had it not been defective .	-1
If you are a fan of gel pens , you will probably like these Pilots ( minus the occasional smearing or ink stoppages ) . It used to be my go-to pen because of its comfortable grip and its smooth , even lines.But then one time I was forced to use a classic BiC Cristal Stic ball point pen ( and I mean *classic , * like 1959 classic ) , and I found that I actually , well ... liked it . A lot . In fact , I began to like the BiC 's so much that I found myself writing paragraphs like the next one.The classic BiC 's were designed exceptionally , like bizarrely well . And I do n't mean in a quaint , historical way . In a modern way -- no , in a *timeless* way -- the classic BiC 's adhere magnificently to principles of space , form , structure , density , and gravity . Because of their hexagonal shape , they require minimal plastic while also retaining a surprising strength ( try snapping one ) , and the hexagonal grip points give the pens impressive writing stability . A tiny hole drilled in the barrel 's body keeps the air pressure the same both inside and outside the pen . Gravity feeds the thick ink down a tube to a free-spinning ball bearing that was manufactured within a fraction of a micron of accuracy . The result is that when the pen is pressed against paper , the ink slides out cleanly and , well , ... perfectly . It 's not only one of the most inexpensive pens ( less than $ 1.50 for a pack of 10 ) , it 's also probably the most efficient pen , with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words ( or about 2 novels ) . Hopefully this helps you understand why , when describing the classic BiC 's , I am comfortable using the word `` masterpiece . `` And hopefully this helps you understand why , in comparison , clunky and over-designed gel pens seem somewhat abhorrent .	-1
I think I will just stick with the regular Pilot G2 pens ( do NOT buy the cheaper imitations , they are terrible ) . These `` bold '' pens seemed nice at first , but I found that I always ended up with ink splotches on my papers , fingers ... pants , shirts ... nose ... .	-1
I did not buy this from amazon , just a local store , but I did buy it based on the good reviews on amazon . For me , writing with this pen is not very smooth , also there are times when the ink does not come out at consistently . I no longer want to use this pen at all because of it .	-1
I was disappointed because I was expecting to get larger flags and they are about the size of a large paperclip .	-1
ENOUGH TO WRITE YES OR NO ! ! THIS IS NOT FOR NOTES . TERRIBLE DESCRPITION OF THIS PRODUCT . WHY DON ; T YOU SAY IT IS TINY PAPER . SAY IT AS YOU SEE IT .	-1
Electric staplers do not work as well and are not as reliable as manuals . They require electricity to work and fail after a year 's usage .	-1
papers MUST be pulled straight and taught with both your hands before it triggers . Sometimes you can get away with a one handed stapling but usually you sit there jamming it in and out 10+ times before it detects it.oh , and it is LOUD . Ridiculously loud piercing snap with a ring afterwards . The loudest thing that ever happens in the office is this stapler . the whole office can hear it . Tried dampening the noise with dynamat , did n't help at all.Staplers should be easy , not hard . This is simple stuff , I thought this was a premium product to make my office a bit nicer but no.I even tried buying `` premium '' staples that cost 5x as much and come in a special little tin , that did n't help . Tried cleaning it with q-tips , nothing works.donotbuy	-1
Visibly curls in my small laser printer . Paper has a yellow tint to it . Better than some paper that has a visible blue tint , but it is definitely not white.The paper never jammed , but I 've never once had a paper jam so not sure that 's worth too much.Paper is way too thin though ! With a report stacked up and placed on a solid surface , text from page 3 can be seen on page 1 . Held up to a light source , print from page 6 is visible on page 1 . It is definitely not suitable for a presentation .	-1
I read the reviews but seeing the overwhelming amount of 5 star reviews , I took a chance and purchased this . I should have known better , this is NOT photo paper . Like everyone else , I agree this is nothing but card stock . The photos came out very rough looking and faded within a few months . Would not suggest purchasing this to anyone . Gon na let my kids use the rest for drawing !	-1
I thought I could save money by printing some photos on this less expensive matte photo paper . Big mistake . Quality is so poor that I 'm ready to just dump it . Ca n't figure what else to use it for .	-1
As soon as I saw the box I noticed it had a water stain on it.Opened the box and half the folders were damp and smelled like cat Pee Pee ! It did not happen in shipping ! Need I say more .	-1
I would suggest another brand . First thing is the plastic itself is not clear to begin with , poor design or Quality control.Used multiple times but still got either bubbles or not very good contact between the two pieces .	-1
There are n't a whole lot of things to say about a tape dispenser . This one is clearly meant for small jobs and if you are sealing a lot of boxes this one will only lead to frustration . First of all the cheap design of it means you have to hold the cylinder on the sides . This also means they ca n't include much tape since your hand has to fit around the entire piece . The tape was suitably sticky to seal my box but when I cut the tape with the serrated edge it would snap back onto the roll every time which means I have to go back and use my fingernails to peal it back off the roll . For a single box or even several boxes this might not be a big deal but if you planning on moving and have a lot of boxes pulling the tape back off the roll each time will get really old . I also had a problem with the tape tearing when I was pulling it back off the roll however I 've never seen a tape dispenser that did n't have that problem . On the other hand if it did n't snap back onto the roll each time I would n't have to worry about it tearing.Scotch claims that this is refillable but God only knows how you get a new roll of tape on since it fits over a solid plastic axle and it has the look and feel of something disposable . This is clearly intended for the budget conscious customer but for my money I 'd spend a little extra to get a quality tape dispenser with a handle that actually is reusable and can hold more than this tiny roll of tape .	-1
I found this product very hard to use . To start the tape I had to struggle with the tape to get is started and lost a lot of tape in the beginning because it would not start properly and only half the tape came off . Then I had to struggle to keep the tape flowing as I taped a box together . Being a former Army wife I have moved many times and have used packaging tape more times than I would like to think about and this tape was the worst I have seen . It is too bulky , hard to start , hard to remove protective cardboard from blade . All in all I would not buy this tape dispenser again .	-1
This tape does deliver on its `` tear by hand '' promise and it works as well as the Scotch traditional packaging tape.Scotch Packaging Tape , 2 Inches x 800 Inches , 6 Rolls ( 142-6 ) . It is more convenient to use and store not requiring a dispenser with its sharp edge or grabbing for a pair of scissors . However it does cost substantially more , 2 1/2 times more than the regular packaging tape . If you only use tape infrequently or if the cost is not a consideration you would be quite happy with the performance of this tape.Update 3/21/2014 I still had some of this roll and when I wet to use it for shipping a package I found this tape has lost most of its ability to stick and easily peels off so it is useless now .	-1
Update , June 2011 : Would lower the stars if I could . I have discovered that this tape simply will not adhere well to a surface that is not firm and flat ( such as cardboard ) . It popped right off padded envelopes . Not good . I 'm sticking to the packaging tape that I buy at Costco. -- -I received a sample 16-yard roll of this product for evaluation via the Amazon Vine program . I was very interested in checking out this tape as I send packages overseas quite frequently.Yes , this does seem to be good tape , albeit a bit on the thin side . Yes , you can tear it by hand . ( It splits easily from side to side . ) Yes , it is convenient.BUT ... and this is a big but , does the convenience of being able to tear the tape by hand justify the outrageous price - double that of other tear-by-hand tapes ? On 12/23/2010 , the price for theScotch Tear-by-Hand Tape , 1.88 Inches x 50 Yards , 2-Pack ( 3842-2 ) ( 50-yard rolls ) of this tape was $ 14.73 ( $ 7.36 per roll , 14 cents per yard ) . TheScotch Tear-by-Hand Tape , 1.88 Inches x 50 Yards , 4-Pack ( 3842-4 ) was $ 20.23 ( $ 5.05 per roll , 10 cents per yard ) .Compare that toLePage 's USPS Tear By Hand Tape , 2 x 800 Inches ( 83726 ) for $ 3.19 ( $ 1.59 per roll , 7 cents per yard ) ( available from Amazon ) .Double the price for the two-pack seems a bit much ... .	-1
These things were a pain . I tried using the avery design suite ... no luck , every time I printed it , it was all over the place . Tried using the template in word ... a hot mess . The templates just would n't line up . I print on templates ALL THE TIME . These were the worst I 've ever come across.The leftovers ... . well ... they will be great for the next yardsale , I 'll use a pen , and write in the numbers . Printing nightmare !	-1
These are fine envelopes ; but if you are buying them for the advertised security tint , they make poor security envelopes . When I sealed my check in one , not only could I tell there was a check inside , I could read the check routing numbers by holding the envelope up to the light . I had to add an extra sheet of folded white paper to hide my check .	-1
I asked my husband to buy me some packing tape today , and he brought home this product . He says he bought it because the outside label states , `` packaging tape , '' at one spot and at another it proclaims , in big bold print , `` SHIPPING . '' When you open up the plastic encasing the tape , you can also read another description , inside the cardboard `` wheel '' that the tape is mounted on : `` Scotch Sealing Tape . '' This means that the company has offered three different names for one product and , unfortunately , none are an accurate description , because here is how this tape acts:1 . When I tried to use the tape , I found it almost impossible to pry loose . Unlike every other packing tape I 've used over the years , this brand does n't have a colorful piece of light cardboard indicating the starting point and making it easy to unhook the tape.2 . When I finally got the tape unhooked and started trying to remove from the cardboard wheel a strip to wrap around a package I needed to mail , it was so weak , it tore apart after only a few inches . This caused me the incredible aggravation of once again having to try and find the starting point of the tape . Worse , the tear was that awful kind where the tape splits apart in the middle , so it creates a narrow , jagged piece with a very skinny tip that is particularly hard to see the end of.3 . Tape ripping to shreds like this is a clear indicator that it is so fragile , it is completely unsuitable as a packing tape . To give you an idea how frail it is , the tape I use in my office , of the 3/4-inch , clear variety , and even masking tape , are both far stronger than this tape.Because of these defects , I do n't recommend this tape for any use whatsoever , and I myself am going to ask for a refund.By the way , the package states that this tape is , `` Made in the USA , '' but since the company distributing the tape has made a false claim about this tape by calling it `` shipping tape , '' perhaps this claim is n't true either .	-1
This tape ended up being worthless quality and all eight rolls I bought went into the garbage . My moving helpers and I were spending way too much time babysitting these rolls of tape , which were nearly impossible to pull off the roll . We drove to Home Depot and bought several packages of brand-name package sealing tape instead .	-1
I read the negative reviews for this tape but since they were several months old , and the 3M company representative had responded to them , I took a leap of faith and hoped that Amazon 's stock had been replaced and the problem resolved.Not so . I purchased four rolls of this tape , and so far one has absolutely NO adhesion , and the other I would rate as barely sticky . I got these for a little over two dollars a roll which was a great price , but I would have been fuming if I paid the $ 6- $ 7 these cost in retail stores and had the same problems.For a company like 3M , which generally sells some of the best products , to have such a lapse in QC and allow this type of inferior product to hit the market is sad . I will not be purchasing this tape again , or any 3M brand packaging tapes for a while , in the hopes that they correct this problem .	-1
This tape is strong and clear and does n't curl up . That I like . But it is very hard to use in a dispenser gun because it is difficult to tear on the blade one-handed . Instead of tearing it just pulls out more and more tape until I have a piece much longer than I need and I have to tear it manually . So pros and cons.Update a few days later : worst tape I 've ever used ! Yes , it is strong and clear but it REFUSES to be cut in the tape gun . Maybe it is TOO strong ! I have to manually cut it every time . I wo n't buy this stuff.Further update after using it numerous times : I ca n't believe all the great reviews ! Worst packing tape I 've ever used , and I 've used TONS over many years . I will probably end up throwing them away and not even use them up due to the troublesome nature of this tape .	-1
I thought it was me until I read the other complaints about the Scotch Super Strength Tape not sticking to packages . While this may be a very strong ( labeled 20x stronger ) packaging tape , it 's not much good if it wo n't stick to the package.I had previously used an off-brand very inexpensive packaging tape and never had any problems with it not sticking . In fact the cheap tape was very sticky , so much so that if you pulled it off the package , it pulled the top layer of the cardboard with it . On the other hand , the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem . I am using 2-3 times as much tape ( criss-crossing it ) as I did with the cheap tape . So the Scotch ends up costing me 4-5 times as much . Overall a real reputation killer for Scotch brand products .	-1
The lead is very soft so one can not push hard or it breaks . It 's not a dark red and can . Be hard to see if not using on white paper . It does not erase easily , but you can erase it . If you are in the market for a cheaper red pencil that is light in color and fragile than this is your pick . I ca n't really say I have tried others .	-1
... or maybe the adhesive does not do so well at zero degrees F ? I bought the 10 x 13 inch envelopes because in theory they hold more pages than 9 x 12 inch envelopes . I think that is fair to expect.The problem is that the paper of the batch of envelopes that I received was so thin/weak that it ripped under the stress of having 120 pages of documents stuffed inside ( even though the capacity looked to be about twice that number of pages ) .Then with the envelope stuffed the adhesive on the already-sealed end looked like it was starting to lift . The grip-seal ( strip-seal ) did not seem to hold well.In fairness it was about zero degrees F -- many things underperform in those conditions ( including people like me ) . But it did not feel like I should be confident the envelope was going to make it to San Diego in one piece.I ended up reinforcing the entire envelope with clear shipping tape . That defeats the bargain.I expected better from Mead Westvaco . Somebody tell me I got a bad batch.Or maybe it is time to move from the frozen tundra to San Diego .	-1
I got two of these from my local Staples . Both were defective . The tabs for opening the top would not work . I actually had to search the internet to find out how they were supposed to open , as there were in instructions in the box . These came in the original packaging from 3M .	-1
I was very excited to get this all in one machine . It had all the features that I was looking for . When it printed the first test page ( the one with the billiard balls ) , I was amazed and happy . I researched this machine and read all the specs including estimated page counts for the print heads and ink cartridges . Actual use comes no where near what they put in the specs.Then 1 month later I had to get more ink , no problem . Then it just kept eating ink . I have had this machine for about 1 year , and have printed less than 2,000 pages total . The ink is very expensive , and it goes through the printheads ( which are more expensive than the ink ) very frequently . I paid $ 450+ for this machine , and have already spent about $ 350 in ink and printheads.Plus , it has broken on me twice , and had to get it replaced.Plus , I experience the same fax problems ( random error messages for no reason ) that others report in these reviewsPlus , the customer support is AWFUL . And I mean awful , you will be less frustrated if you just threw your printer out the window.I bought HP because I thought its company and products were top notch . Not the case here.I will never buy another HP Printer again.As a matter of fact , I am thinking of ditching this one because of the expense of mainenance . For the $ 350 it will cost me next year to maintain it , I may be better off buying a different printer .	-1
Found out after I unwrapped everything that this printer does n't work with Windows 2000 : ( It 's for Windoes XP and Macs ( not sure which one ) only after calling support.What a waste of time .	-1
In 6 months and less than 6,000 copies have had to have unit replaced by HP ( with refurbished units ) twice . Frequent print head failure which is expensive to replace . Ink very expensive and goes quickly . Officejet is supplied with base level Iris software so it can not print multiple copies of documents with a table or an embedded image . Can only print one page at a time.Scanning is excellent both in speed and quality . Copy quality is outstanding and speed is very good . For straight color printing cost per page is much lower for color laserjets from HP or Minolta .	-1
Be aware , that thing does n't have self adhesive . it is a bad thing to have to use your lips or tongue to sealed it ! and it is a bad too to use external source of adhesive tap each time u use it . avoid and seek the ones with self adhesive	-1
The design is all wrong ! If you want to go from page 1 to page 35 or page 50 or page 100 , be prepared not to pop the hinges and mess up the whole binder . Just horrid and I wish I had returned while I still could . Got a 3 & # 34 ; from OfficeMax that has ROUND hinges and no problems ... Extreme couponer . esdw	-1
Ok I hate to write negative reviews but these envelopes have very poor glue on the peel and stick side . I 'm putting a piece of scotch tape on everything to make sure they stay shut which kind of defeats the purpose of buying & # 34 ; Grip-Seal & # 34 ; which do n't really grip that well .	-1
I dislike intensely rulers that do n't start at zero . This one has about 1/8 '' at either end before the measurements start . I guess this is just a lazy way of making rulers to low tolerances . The model it relaced `` R590-15 was exactly 15 '' long and started and ended on the mark . Just ca n't see this with the picture , so I ordered it without knowing this .	-1
Cross has been the maker of fine writing instruments for decades . So what happened to the quality of their refills ? I purchased a fine-point two-pack for the twist pen expecting exceptional quality , and what I get is a refill that blobs ink all over my document . I guess I 'll retire my Cross pen . I get better performance from a Pilot G2 Extra fine point gel pen - two for under $ 3 .	-1
does not work at all not work at alldoes not work at all cant tell u what the problem is I mean its a friggen stapler and I thought paying more money would guarentee something that worked -- now I will have to use the one my mom swiped from work -It works plus has her name written on it so I will have to watch my ps and qs .	-1
Another sad example of Chinese junk ! ! ! The stapler made famous by its legacy on American desks and the movie Office Space is ... dead . This piece of junk was cracked because it was made of plastic , and stapled once because it 's mechanism was cheap metal that jammed . It 's not even good enough for a paperweight because the color is n't even correct or uniform ! Take my advice , either pay for the standard metal stapler , made somewhere else if possible , or hold on to the one you 've got . By the way , tried ordering a replacement , which Amazon promptly sent , only to receive another POS that was in even worse condition ! Avoid , Avoid , Avoid ! ! ! !	-1
I like the concept of a rubber bands in a convenient ball.When I first received them , I was initially pleased . Purchased in late November , it is now mid February of the following year.As I am getting thru the rubber band ball , I find they snap and break even before surrounding an object . Considering the price , I can not justify recommending them.In many cases , they do n't seem to stretch much as well .	-1
It 's a rubber band ball , full of rubber bands ... What could possibly go wrong ? Off the cuff , I 'd say somewhere between 10-20 % of them snapped ( broke ) the first time being stretched ( which hurts , but most importantly is tremendously irritating , especially when you 're in the middle of a rubber band war , thus giving your enemy the upper hand ) . It 's a fun looking piece of sculpture on your desk , fun to toss around . Just do n't try to use the rubber bands .	-1
This is an excellent cordless hands-free phone as long as you do not have any other wireless devices at home . I have been using this phone for several months now and I have a wireless G network at home . This phone completely shuts down my entire wireless network . I have tried everything from changing the channel on the wireless network to changing the channel on the phone but the problem is resolved only temporarily . It somehow changes its own channel to the same one that my wireless network is running resulting is total disruption of all computers and laptops . Not only does it interfere with my wireless network , it is also affected by microwave oven . If you are talking in the kitchen and using microwave at the same time , this phone will pick up the waves from your microwave creating so much noise that you can barely talk . I have used other cordless phones before and none of them created this kind of wireless hell that this device does . After using it for several months , the disadvantages outweigh its advantages and I am looking for a substitute .	-1
I 've been using the CT-12 for over a year . It seemed like the perfect home office phone ... portable ; hands-free , allowing the user to type and talk ; compact and comfortable . It 's caller ID-ready , has good noise reduction and has a speed dial function and mute button . In addition , Plantronics has one of the best warranties I 've ever experienced . I simply called when my first phone stopped working and they sent a new one within a couple of days , no hassle , no paperwork . So why only two stars ? First , the belt clip is inadequate ( especially for those of us who never wear belts . ) The clip is too weak to clip to jeans , so I always have to wear a shirt with a pocket in order to have a place to put the phone . This is a serious flaw , as I discovered the clip 's weakness only after the phone fell off my pants and onto the floor the first few times I tried it.Second , the number pad is frustratingly small . It is easy to misdial with keys the size of a pencil eraser.Third , and most important , the unit 's phone jack seems to have a design flaw . I am on my second phone within one year and each one has , over several months , started crackling and cutting out . At first I thought it was the headset , since holding the cord a certain way would eliminate the crackling sound . On a hunch , I bought a new headset from another manufacturer , plugged it in , and immediately started getting the crackling noise . Now that my warranty has expired , I will not be buying a replacement phone , but looking for a new manufacturer altogether . A real pity , I loved this phone .	-1
I was happy to find a phone with a mute button after my GE crapped out . This was a great phone for 2 to 3 weeks until the cord that attached the headphones starting to make a crackling noise . Also , the WiFi network card I used interferred with the phone everytime , rendering it useless while using my laptop.I so badly wanted this phone to work and work well . All other aspects were superb : large reception area , too many Caller Id stored numbers to count , great features and compact , PLUS a mute button for when one must do laundry on long conference calls from home.This phone is wonderful in theory , not so hot on actual function .	-1
The idiots who designed this made it with no clip on the cap , which I need to carry it in my pocket.Probably designed in a third world country where they do n't have pockets in what few clothes they own.It does n't say where the product was actually made . About half of the package is in some foreign language , not English.Now I know not to buy Newell Rubbermaid products ( who makes Sharpies ) .	-1
I got this to write my mom 's name on her dark clothing items . I was expecting it to write like my black ones . It does n't write well at all on fabric , so I was very disappointed . And , in addition to the tip not being firm enough while trying to write on fabric , it definitely is not writing in a fine line as the black ones I have do - it is almost like a wide point , that 's how far off it is .	-1
After having problems with the cheaper , non-OEM cartridges , I decided to go back to the HP brand . I 've always had good luck with the genuine HP product - until this one . After only several uses , one of the colors stopped working , rendering the cartridge useless . The unit was within its expiration date . I tried running the 'clean printheads ' several times with no luck.I blame it on a potential bad batch because when I visited our local big box retailer and purchased the same cartridge , at retail price , it worked fine .	-1
My husband is self-employed here at our home and was in a better position to test this item than I was , as I have to have my legs propped up at all times while sitting . Well he tried it out and felt it to be a very dangerous item as it got in the way and was easy to trip over , etc . Adjusting it for your own particular needs , he also felt to be complex and too difficult for someone sitting in a regular office without all the tools that he has handy . I 'm not sure what he did with it , but it sure is n't under his feet .	-1
Very thin and flimsy plastic . Dropped them . Several cracked and the lead in the others broke into pieces . What a waste .	-1
I 've used many three ring binders in my life and this is by far the cheapest in quality of any I 've ever used . Being that I am not keen on leaving a single star review for products , always trying to find redeeming qualities , this is one of the rare products that really is not worthy of purchase unless it can be found at a dollar store and you are desperate for a matte white binder . Mine arrived with some dirt inside the rear cover 's clear sheet and I can not for the life of me get it out . Because the material is so thin and flimsy , I will not try any more for fear of tearing it . The corners of the binder are each already bent and the cardboard structure is clearly less sturdy than any of the other binders I currently have in my home or office . The 1 1/2 inches of this binder will hold more papers than I would trust to be protected by this binder . With a basic round three ring hardware attached to the rear of the cover , I expect that a full binder would fall apart very quickly . I can not with a clear conscience recommend this binder .	-1
I received this binder with a torn corner . I 'm not sure when or how this happened , but it did let me see that the plastic cover is not thick or strong at all . It is n't the sturdiest binder I 've ever had , but if it is going to be used for something that wo n't cause too much wear and tear , it would probably be okay . I would n't buy another one like this because of the reasons posted above .	-1
These are flimsy and poorly constructed . Spend a couple dollars more and get better quality . The rings in the binder do n't close , so loose leaf paper takes on a whole different meaning . If you plan on carrying these in a backpack , forget it , you may as well use paper folders .	-1
the rings open up too easily an then after not long , they do n't even close correctly .	-1
To say this binder is basic is an understatement it is stark white with a matte plastic cover that can allow custom inserts ( project titles , etc. ) . The outer plastic is very , very thin and cheap and only one piece covers the entire binder , with no reinforcements at the seams . Honestly , I ca n't say it lasting very long and inserting an 8x10 title page on the front cover it moves around a lot , with a very loose fit , making that feature fairly useless . Even less helpful are the cheap interior plastic pockets , one of which was ripped off even before I got it.This is a dirt cheap binder , and it looks and feels it . For a few cents more there are better , longer-lasting options out there .	-1
Look , this is NOT a & # 34 ; cork & # 34 ; board , because as far as I can determine , there is no real cork anywhere on the product . And the & # 34 ; graphite & # 34 ; frame also implies a quality that is nonexistent . The frame appears to be simple plastic , colored dark grey/black.The four brackets you are supposed to use to attach it to your wall , are extreme overkill and also are very difficult to attach and align . This product is very light weight , and does not need such a complicated hanging system ... Other reviewers have also had various issues with this bulletin board , including how soon the & # 34 ; cork & # 34 ; surface peels , etc.Basically the price is way too high and the quality too low , and the assembly brackets are far too complicated and unnecessary.Furthermore , the artificial & # 34 ; cork & # 34 ; surface and color are very unattractive and cheap looking .	-1
I read the reviews and they were excellent . However , this tape will not tear on my tape dispenser . All others do . I like the clearness but still find them unusable . Find another product .	-1
I purchased this Hammermill glossy flyer paper for the convenience of Amazon , the Hammermill name , and other reviews . However , On my Canon inkjet printer , the color comes out quite dull and not true to what 's on your screen . I had used Staples glossy brochure and flyer paper in the past with good results , so I decided to go ahead and purchase some more at Staples -- the difference is amazing . The Staples paper is true to color and bright . The exact same picture with the exact same settings on the Hammermill -- not true to color and not bright.Perhaps it is just not the right paper for a Canon injet ( ip6600 ) . All I know is , I wo n't be purchasing this brand again.As far as purchasing from Amazon , it came in 2 days with Amazon Prime , as always .	-1
This looked so cheap that I sent it back as soon as possible . It looked like loose plastic on the outside and the inside was nothing special . Ugh ! !	-1
Looks great with the storage zipper pocket and all but fell apart after very minimal use . I 'd steer clear of this brand , based on this experience .	-1
I am a big fan of Cambridge notebooks but this pad-folio is less than functional . For starters , the outer material looks cheap . It has the wavy appearance that comes with faux-leather that has n't been pulled tight before sewing the seams . Furthermore , the zipper pocket feels like it will rip if I do n't handle the zipper pull with surgeon like precision . The sticky note slot is a neat idea in theory but ends at that - it only has enough space available for about 15 sticky notes so do n't dream of loading a whole sticky notepad in there . I was n't really surprised either when my standard sized business cards did n't fit in the business card slots . Do n't waste your money .	-1
which is what I wanted it for . Hopefully it will work for something else some day , but this is a lot to pay for something I have little use for other than that specific task .	-1
Creating the transfer is easy -- the instructions are simple to follow and they work . However , after the first wash ( delicate cycle in a front-loader , cold water , hang to dry ) , the ink starts washing off and the edges start to become frayed . Also , the image itself starts to become crinkled ! Maybe hand washing is what 's needed but that 's not something the instructions call for . In fact , it says you can machine wash & dry -- clearly , you ca n't .	-1
It should not be this hard to peel.It does not peel.It should be easy.I threw the bag of sheete in the trash . Waste of money .	-1
I have tried TWO HP laserjet compatible toner cartridges for my HP Laserjet 1018 and both were substandard and had to be returned for a refund to different companies . One froze my printer as soon as I put it in . The other printed unevenly . I now will only purchase ORIGINAL HP toner cartridges for my machine .	-1
title says it all . Do n't know if I 'm going to get 1,000 or 1,500 or even 2,000 pages from this toner replacement but the way I see it , $ 10 is more than worth it for any of those quantities . I have an HP LaserJet 1012 - no color , duplex or multiple uses other than straight B & W ; printing . HP ( thru Staples or their own website ) wants $ 80 PLUS tax . It 's a simple laserjet for simple printing - if this is what you have , you ca n't go wrong with this product IMHO . **UPDATE** less than 1 month and 50 pages later , streaks and blank areas on every sheet . Yes , I 'm shaking it . PLUS , the original seller is no more as they changed names presumably secondary to all the bad press . I have to go with an OEM product here to get my money 's worth , I guess . Too bad - I reviewed this too soon .	-1
In spite of this reliable printer 's great reputation , it creates steam during the printing process . This is a real deal-killer . No matter how consistent its performance , there is no way I can recommend a printer that steams as it sucks moisture of out printer paper . It turns out this is a common complaint from owners of the LaserJet 1012 . Be warned .	-1
I bought a HP desktop seven years ago . The day after the warranty expired , I called in a problem that had been chronic . HP refused to honor its warranty and instead sent me to India , where people were in training . Ultimately , they convinced me to reformat the disk even though I was convinced it was a hardware problem . They did n't advise me to buy a new disk , which I should have done.I had been using the hp backup utility . It seems to be an overlay on microsoft , but when I tried to restore the files , it failed . The process to get back what I could was arduous.I complained about this up to the top of their pecking order , who told me to get lost . I resolved to never ever buy anything from them again.A couple of weeks ago , my hp1020 printer paper catch broke . I had bought this printer before the computer failed , and it has worked well for more than four years . I went online to see how to replace the cheap chinese plastic paper receiver . HP customer service sent me in circles . Ultimately , they do n't support their product .	-1
I previously gave this printer 5 stars . However , beware . If you print , say , 50 pages in a row , the printer slows from its rated throughput to only ca . 4 pages per minute . HP tech support confirms this , and indicates that a cheap printer 'without a fan ' overheats , and compensates by stopping the continuous printing ... it could not be expected to do any better . Then why is it rated at 15 ppm ? What nonsense . The printer is misrepresented . If you only print a couple of pages at a time , then this is fine . But if you print out program code or book or article manuscripts , this is a BIG problem .	-1
I have had this printer for about 15 months now , and I print only on Canon paper . The colors are always either too yellow or too magenta ( even b & w ; images have a color cast ! ) , and Canon 's own reps could not figure out why or help resolve the problem . I printed on regular computer paper , and the colors were fine . It also does n't print with the densities shown on my original files . My images look exactly right on my computer and print beautifully when I send them to a lab , and I 'm an advanced amateur photographer . In other words , I know well enough what I 'm doing , so it 's not operator error but a printer problem ( which Canon agrees on ) . My mother , who is an artist , had recommended this printer to me , but she began to see a color cast as well and replaced it with an HP printer that 's dead on.When I originally bought this printer , everyone 's reviews said to only use Canon paper to get the best quality , but I 'd have to disagree . I 'm not sure whether to waste money on buying a different brand of paper and trying that , or just buy a different printer , but this one gets a thumbs down from me . What a waste of $ 200 .	-1
I 'll be fair . This printer printed out some of the best photos of my life -- pictures when I first was dating my boyfriend , family photos , when my boyfriend proposed to me , our first big trip together , and yes , even my cute little doggie . But the honeymoon is over . The printer broke down after a year and a half of use . The cause ? You got me . I would 've thought it would have lasted at least 2 years -- but nope . Even my old HP is still running . The upside ... I upgraded to the IP6000D . : )	-1
I really liked this printer while it worked , and the document feeder was really handy . I would never use anything but a flatbed scanner because it is so versatile . I bought the HP back in April 2004 , and I was shocked to see that I replaced with with a Canon PIXMA iP3000 in October 2004 . I still have the Canon and it is still working ! The HP just stopped printing and for the price vs. the cost of fixing it , it made no sense to fix it at the time . I 'll stick to Canon .	-1
This printer was fine until I changed cartridges and a contact was dirty . Now it wo n't quit printing alignment pages all the time . I have about a million now , and its cost me a fortune in ink . Every 3 or 4 print jobs and I get another one.I 've spent hours with technical support , who keep leading me through the same old song and dance , disconnect the usb cable , hit some buttons , print another page I do n't need , and scan . Voila it works ! Case finished.NO IT IS NOT.The tech support people do n't speak English and it shows in their grammar and inability to understand that my problem seems to be a variant on what they have in their knowlege base.HP would do better to hire native English speakers . I 'll never buy another HP printer.Oh , they print fine , that is , if you want a million alignment pages .	-1

Not fair to the ink that I hated this printer so much , but this expensive set of cartridges dried up just as fast as the cheaper no-names ... go figure . I finally wised up and bought another brand of printer .	-1
We picked up this `` HP Everyday Photo Paper '' to print product pictures for my wife 's small business on better quality paper than `` plain paper '' . The end results are better than plain paper , but far below most other lower cost photo paper . Here are my observations : Pros -+ Inexpensive ; for photo paper , this is relatively low pricedCons -- Slow Drying ; myBrother MFC-6490CW Professional Series Color Inkjet Wireless All-in-One Printerhas fairly quick drying ink on most papers , but was really surprised that my prints smudged even after sitting for more than five minutes- Marginal Image Quality ; no amount of tweaking I could do produced `` outstanding '' resultsWe will use the rest of this paper , but will not buy it again.CFH	-1
It 's so slippery , my laser mouse did n't work at all . There 's little tactile feedback , it just feels like you 're gliding across fake marble or something . Very very uncomfortable . Ended up throwing it away , basically .	-1
The ink cartridge is O.K . but the Epson R1800 printer is a huge ink hog . The Epson printer 's that use this cartridge should all be recalled .	-1
I realized that if you just wiggle the tape , and peel off the plastic , then insert whatever you have , then cover back the plastic , then press hard , its just the same as pulling it thru the 'machine ' .	-1
For $ 30 this is a waste of money . What I like is the concept . The legs fit into the desk and you slide the cover over the desk and everything fits for travel perfectly . However , the quality of the material is poor as well as the way it all fits together . Every time I 've used the table it wobbles . It wo n't hold a computer or project securely . I would not put anything over the weight of 2lbs on this thing . After it fell over with the projector on it I had to use two boxed on a chair to prop the projector up . Concept good , but look for something better if you are considering this . You wo n't be happy .	-1
This calculator has pretty much everything in the world you would need from a calculator but why oh why did they leave out a fraction and mixed number buttons ? ? The process to enter fractions is frustrating when you have to do it over and over and even the most basic calculators have these buttons . Even the simpler TI-34 has these buttons . It 's an omission of such a basic feature like this that looses stars from me . Otherwise it is a great device I just have no idea why something so basic and common is n't one of the buttons . If I was n't required to own it I would return it for a device with the same features but with the fraction buttons .	-1
I was excited to receive this phone , charge up the batteries , and try it out . Unfortunately , after plugging this phone into my line ( Verizon phone service with DSL , DSL filter on the line ) , about 80 % of the time the phone would not get a dial tone . Eventually I determined that somehow the the 8865 was dialing a `` 1 '' all by itself ( an 800 number without a preceding `` 1 '' went through OK , a local number would get error `` do not dial a 1 for this number '' ) . Dialing with the handset or base resulted in the same behavior.Thinking this was a bad unit , I tried a 2nd unit ( same model ) , this one did the same thing . @ $ # ^ % @ $ # ! So there is either a design flaw with this model or there 's a bad batch of 8885 's floating around . Uniden CS was polite but unhelpful , so both phones had to be returned.I gave this unit two stars due to it 's sleek design ( though I think the base unit is a bit *too* small and the tiny buttons could be an issue ) . Perhaps your luck with this model will be better than mine .	-1
I previously reviewed this item and gave it two stars because of some of its great features . However , as I mentioned before , I have a small house ( about 1400 sq . ft. ) and the phone did n't work in much of it . People always complained that I was cutting in and out and they usually thought I was on a cell phone . It was worse than my prior , less powerful phone , which cut out only about half as much.Now , after seven months of moderate use , the phone has died . No sound goes in either direction . It 's beyond the 30-day period during which Amazon will accept a return , and I am still waiting to hear from Uniden to see whether they will replace the phone.I now ca n't say whether the phone 's problems all along were because it was a defective unit , or whether this is just a crummy phone , but I can say for certain that it does n't merit the rave reviews given here , and so far , customer service from Uniden is non-existent . I will update this again if they replace the phone and it works better , but I must say , I have seldom been as unimpressed with an electronic product . Nifty features do n't really matter if the basic functions do n't work . Amazon 's editing process does n't let you change the number of stars on a given review , but I 'd take away the stars and give this product nothing . This one is a loser .	-1
You buy used and you take your chances . The item broke down almost immediately after purchase . The vendor was willing to replace it , but I decided additional shipping charges and another used unit were not worth the risk . I bought a new printer instead .	-1
When you read many reviews , you can easily see that the `` one-star '' ratings are usually by people who do n't read the instructions , or possibly just ca n't understand them . I 've read all of the one-star ratings on this R-200 now and I totally agree with them . No I 'm not a printer expert , but I 've owned a lot of different brands of printers and this is by far the worst , though not the most expensive.My dad had an Epson b & w ; printer in the 90 's and each time I had to use it , I would laugh and laugh at how it took such a long time when you turned it on to get ready to print : grunting , groaning , clicking , whirring ... over and over for literally minutes . I swore I 'd never buy an Epson printer , though some of their other products are useable.But ... silly me ... when it was time to replace my nice HP printer simply because I wanted something that would do a perfect job on `` photographs '' , I fell prey to Epson 's claim to top quality . It really did n't dawn on me that the unit would be virtually the same feed and cleaning mechanism as my father 's old piece of junk . I hated it from the beginning . Photos were NOT photo quality , it took ages and ages to start printing , and it ate ink like a famished muppet monster . If you do n't print regularly , the ink cartridges ( there 's 6 total , each costing big bucks from Epson ) dry up on the outputs , and even though you can shake them and hear the slosh , they do n't work . If you buy non-Epson cartridges you get a warning that you are voiding your warranty when you use them , even though they do work fine , and some last much longer than Epson's.But now after 3 years I 've had enough of this expensive POC so I 'll have to gamble on some other brand ... it will definitely never , never , never be another Epson , I do n't care if President Obama puts his picture on the front of it , and God blesses it himself , I will not buy it.One point I can make to those of you stuck with this piece of junk : If you leave it turned on 24/7 it does n't go through all of the initial bracketybrack setup routine . But it still dries up and wo n't work , even if you 're just printing black , if you have run out of cyan or yellow , it WILL NOT WORK until you buy more cartridges to allow to dry out . It 's a total scam and believe me , you will be sorry ... maybe your initial impression will be good , but just wait ... you 'll see.UPDATE 9/30/12 : OK so I dawdled around and did n't order the new printer until today . I am doing a government application for immigration visa for my wife , and that requires mounds of printing and copying . Today I needed to print out my bank statement for the last year , and when I went to the bank site , it said they are changing the system on the 3rd and I 'll only have the past ONE month available ... so of course I want to print this immediately . My printer had been moved a few days ago and it 's been turned off during that time , so I reluctantly started fiddling with it to make it come on properly . About 20 or 25 times I turned it on and off and all I get are blinking lights . I did every trick I 've ever done before , unplugging and sloshing the cartridges , going to the cartridge cleaning and nozzle check software ... nothing at all worked . So I go back and read all of these ONE STAR reviews again , and of course they 're all having the same problems . I choke back the urge to drop an atomic bomb on the Epson Headquarters and I look for the best printer ( non-Epson ) that I can afford , and order a Hewlett Packard OJPRO8100 Wireless Color Printer which has an abundance of good reviews and only a few 3-star reviews , no negatives ... $ 110 compared to over $ 200 for the Epson ( not counting the $ 200 or so I 've spent on ink cartridges to replace cartridges that still contained ink ) . Then I read one more review on the Epson 200 , which said something about unplugging the power cord to reset the interlocks . Well that should n't work , because that 's what always causes the problems ... but I tried it and bingo , suddenly the printer works as good as it ever did ( marginal and slow ) . At least I managed to print my bank statement . Wish I could bill Epson for all of the hours and hours I 've spent trying to make this stupid piece of junk work !	-1
I bought this for the DVD disc printing using a Mac G4 laptop . Ready to put cool disc art on my amazing lttle films . But hu uh . NO LUCK . SPENT HOURS FRETTING OVER EVERY STEP , BUT NOTHING . TRAY JUST VIBRATES IN THE SLOT . BACKS IN AND OUT WITH MY BLANK DISC . THEN RED LIGHTS ON THE PRINTER FLASH IN MOCKERY . Hate this Epson non DVD print disabled fraud . Love the Mac , though . This is a new , out of the box model . And there 's no help for the problem . Under menu HELP it actually says `` No help available . '' Boy , that chutzpah.I 'm not new to printers or settting up software.Beware buyer . Do n't be a sucker .	-1
I 've given this phone more than a fair trial . I 've purchased this and 5825 phones three times . ( The 5825 has no answering device but identical handsets . ) All of their identical handsets have malfunctioned immediately or eventually . The first time one of the screens lost contrast and became unreadable . The last two times the handset became inoperable after being left off of the cradle for several hours . None of the buttons would respond until the phone was recradled for a moment . ( This would happen even after the batteries were fully charged . ) I returned the first two for refunds , but the third time I sent a message to VTech 's online `` support . '' Their email response was : `` Due to the nature of your inquiry , your request would have to be handled by a representative who will provide you with the more detailed information . '' But when I called the `` tech support '' number provided I infuriatingly discovered that they only have automated tech support when you select the support phone menu option . So , I called the sales number and the rep said they are trying out this new automated approach to `` tech support . '' That is , they have decided to ditch genuine support.I asked to speak to a sales supervisor and he said that they have had other complaints about the inoperable handsets . He offered to send me replacement handsets , saying that he thought they have fixed the issue . Which brings up the obvious question : why are they still permitting retailers to sell units that VTech knows have defects ? I 've only had this one for a week . Should n't those defective phones be recalled ? The supervisor 's only response was to chuckle nervously.So , while these phones have good talk time and audio quality , and respectable features , I ca n't recommend them since they are highly prone to defects and the company has such a laughable excuse for support .	-1
Using these labels has been nothing but trouble , producing shoddy results and labels that peel away from the CD/DVD . As for the formatting and printing process , it was even worse . We tried downloading their software for Mac online and followed all the directions . It was fairly straightforward , so we finished everything and went to print it . What happened next ? THEY WANTED MONEY . IT WOULD NOT PRINT WITHOUT A WATERMARK UNLESS YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE . After ALREADY BUYING their product , there was a HIDDEN COST . We wasted time putting everything together only to find we would have to come up with a work-around . That work-around took a tremendous amount of time , and again , had mediocre results because of formatting issues as well as the matte finish ( the paper feels kind of rough and cheap , worse than some basic printing papers ) . The initial price of these labels is a trick . They seem cheap , but they have hidden costs and the labels themselves do n't even stick , sometimes nearly ruining people 's drives . BAD , BAD , BAD .	-1
This review is being written after two years of use in a busy restaurant and bar , so I 've really put this system to the test . Though it has admirable voice quality , this system has so many quirks that it just should n't be considered as a primary business phone system . First and foremost , when you are on one of the lines speaking to a customer , and a call rings on the other line , the line you are speaking on gets constantly interrupted with momentary silencing of your voice so that the person on the other end of the line hears your voice dropping out every few seconds while the other line is ringing ! ! ! This is an absolutely unforgivable flaw ! Uniden tech support told me that there is no way to disable this quirk either . You just have to live with it . For shame ! Also , once every few days , the phone system decides to reset itself without warning . So , the phone rings , you answer and it disconnects the person calling while you are greeted with the `` Welcome '' screen as the system resets itself . After about a minute or so , you 're able to receive calls again . As an added bonus , it occasionally screeches super loud feedback into your ear instead of connecting you to the call you are answering . Seriously , it hurts your eardrums something awful.The signal is VERY fussy too . It does n't like working when near metal objects like restaurant refrigerators and other large appliances , nor does it work very well if any masonry walls are between you and the base.Terrible phone system . I have a one line and two line phone system from Uniden and would n't recommend it to anyone . Stay clear of this poorly designed , clearly inferior product .	-1
... Give me a break ! Just out of curiousity , I bought a 5.8 GHz cordless at a local store and compared it to my trusty , twenty-dollar 900MHz Uniden.Guess what ? The two phones sounded PRETTY MUCH THE SAME , in fact the 900MHz one was actually a little clearer in some parts of the house.I will say though , the 5.8GHz phone does sound better than the disastrous 2.4GHz Uniden I bought and returned last year . But this one 's going back too ... why pay more for what is basically the same performance ? Again : DO N'T BELIEVE THE ADVERTISING B.S . ! ! ! ! I 'm giving this phone 1 star not for its actual performance , but for the absolutely shameless advertising HYPE around it . ( This is kind of like a 3.0GHz PC compared to a 1.2GHz PC : with 90 % of commonly used applications , their performance is virtually identical ... only you 'll pay a lot more for the bigger number GHz . )	-1
Epson claims photos printed from PictureMates are waterproof . This oft repeated claim is blatantly false . I 'm disappointed that professional reviewers have n't exposed this farce . Newly printed photos seem to have some waterproofing but that quickly disappears . Test it yourself . Simply place a drop of water on a months old photo , wait a few seconds , gently mat the paper . The result is a ruined photo . How is that waterproof ? I bought this printer because of the great quality ( true ) and waterproof photo feature . I 'm really disappointed with the waterproof claim . They 've duped us all.Kudos to the other photo printer manufacturers for not following suit with equally false claims . It must have been tempting to do so .	-1
Love the look of it , price was great but if you do a lot of taping as I do , the base is not weighted enough to truly be & # 34 ; one handed & # 34 ; with ease . If you are just looking for a desk accessory or only use tape now and then-price and looks ca n't be beat .	-1
I ordered this pen and the first one had a super scratchy nib - it can happen and it is a Fine nib , but it sounded like I was ripping phone-books while writing . So , the exchange came promptly from Amazon - this new one is n't scratchy , but it writes very ... choppy is the best way to put it . It does n't skip exactly , but line width 's vary wildly even when writing at a consistent speed.So , the second pen had a nib that looked uneven ( not the tines ) . The sides had different angles when it bent in to make the nib point . This was clearly visible to the naked eye so I imagine this did n't help . The main issue seemed to be the 'required ' way to hold this pen - it 's a good angle , but sometimes you need to hold something slightly different . The second pen I got , the nib would have worked if I could tilt the pen more , but then my finger was holding the edge and not on the 'guides ' . I saw no easy way through internet searching to pull the feed out ( the nib comes off easy , but that wo n't change the angle ) . For a $ 20 pen , this was n't worth the hassle . It is n't like this is some nice desk pen people 'ohhh ' and 'awe ' at . It 's a fucntional pen that needed to work right the first time and every time - it didn't.I did give it a second star for the fact it started writing instantly , every try . Even my more expensive pens occassionaly require a few strokes to get the pen fully up to speed . This lamy wrote the second I put the inked converter in and never stopped . So , if you get one with a good nib/feed - it should be great . I ca n't just keep sending it back and playing the lottery .	-1
This is probably a fine label machine for most computrs , but it would n't work with my new Vista operating system.Brother 's customer service representative put forth great effort to do what was needed to make the driver function . After three phone sessions with Brother , the driver did work ; sort of . Yes the label printer worked , but then my printer/copier wouldn't.I suppose that I fiddled with it for over an hour by myself , and then almost that long in company with a Brother Tech Support person . I must say that the Brother telephone support people were really great . They seemed to know what they were talking agout . They were patient and really tried to get the thing working properly.After I found that what had been done for the Brother machine messed up the operation of my Canon printer/copier I decided enough was enough , and the label printer is now landfill somewhere .	-1
This item is being heavily discounted at some online retailers , but make sure you read the fine print before buying : Make sure you can return it for a refund , not just an exchange.It 's a fine scanner when it operates -- just read the reviews . But I suspect many people are returning it because , on some systems , software and driver conflicts are causing problems.I tried running it from a Toshiba A10 Satellite laptop with Windows XP and Adobe Photoshop 6.01 . It scanned beautifully -- once . After that , the system refused to see the scanner when it was connected . I spent several hours on the phone with Canon customer support trying to resolve it . The rep was very helpful and patient , but ultimately the problem could not be resolved.I went even further , did a several clean system installs on my computer and loaded apps one by one , testing the scanner each time . The same thing happened each time -- one good operation of the scanner , and then the system ignored it.I 'm disappointed that what promised to be a very good scanner wo n't operate due to the mysteries of compatibility . But I 'm more disappointed that I can only return it for an exchange . I do n't need a duplicate of the problems.I also do n't need a $ 130 boat anchor , which is about all the scanner is right now . I 'll probably stick it in a closet and try it with a new system one day , if and when I get one.Again , it seems to be a great scanner if it will run on your system . But before you buy make sure you can return it for a refund . That way if it does n't work for you you wo n't get burned.EDITED TO ADD : Many months after I first purchased this scanner and wrote this review I downloaded newly updated driver software from the manufacturer . That apparently finally resolved the issues . The scanner has been working fine ever since .	-1
I run a small business and had finally worn out my HP G85 OfficeJet and was looking for a replacement all-in-one for my home office . This was not it.This is my second go around with this specific printer . I returned the first one because I thought I had a lemon . I was mistaken , they are just that bad.Printer consistently jams if you try to print multiple documents . You ca n't see the jam because there is not one . You just press 'OK ' like you had actually cleared something and it will start printing again.It will not receive incoming faxes from certain types of fax machines . And yes , that was verified by HP support.It will not work on any type of VOIP service . This was also verified by HP support.And on & on ... ..I cringed every time I selected 'File -- - > Print . If the printer were to have burst into flames and melted down to the very core of the planet I would not have been the least suprised.Anyhow , I have thrown it in the trash . About 200 bucks down the tubes but it was more than worth it to avoid the daily frustration of dealing with this printer .	-1
I have always been an HP fan and have owned 7 HP printers over the years , including 3 Laserjets . Until this one , I would have highly recommended HP but it appears HP has abandoned their loyal customers and is now producing garbage . I have had this all-in-one for 9 mo . and have yet to get it to scan more than once . After countless hours installing , re-installing on 2 different PCs , using HPs support website , tech support and even their senior tech support who sent me a new printer , it wo n't work . My last call involved 3+ hours on the phone dissecting my registry after which I was told I had operating system problems . From day one , the software locked up when I tried to scan . HP insists it will work on a clean install . So yesterday , I started with a new hard drive , installed Windows XP but nothing else and then the printer driver . It works -- once ! Then I installed Office XP and after that it locks up the first time I try to scan . I will never , ever buy another HP product ! ! ! After reading the reviews here and elsewhere , it is certain that this software is crap , as is the 6210 . Half the people who write reviews have had problems with this overpriced paperweight . Stay FAR , FAR away ! ! ! HP are you reading this ? ? ? Check case ID 6300331720 . That 's only one of 3 case IDs I have . If I billed you for all my time trying to make this 6210 work , I could buy a color laser printer !	-1
At first , I was VERY pleased with this printer . After a few months , I kept getting a `` carriage jam '' error . I have no jams , buj to reset the printer takes some cumbersome effort . I got online , and learned that this is a COMMON and known problem with this printer . Shop around -- the printer is great , except these `` carriage jams '' appear out of nowhere and for no reason -- a glitch -- and it takes up to five minutes to reset the printer to work again . Good printer , until it jams ... .UPDATE : The scanner does not work with VISTA . Known issue per HP .	-1
I have the OfficeJet 6110 All-in-One for just over a year . It worked well for several months and I was very pleased with the purchase . But when I bought a new HP desktop ( my old one was also an HP desktop ) , problems started happening . It took me days and millions of phone calls , the problem still persists . Here 's what I figured out in the process about HP products:1 . HP 's own printers and computers do n't work together . Duplicate software get installed and conflict with each other.2 . HP 's printer support staff do NOT talk to the computer support staff . When software conflicts start -- all HP software , one has to figure out on one 's own where the problems are before calling them . Otherwise , while various technical support staff try to diagnose the problem , more problems will happen as various drivers get deleted and re-installed.3 . Once an HP 's software ( my experience is mostly with HP printers ) is installed , one can NOT get rid of it by uninstalling it . HP provides a `` software cleanup utility '' , which must be run several times ( with re-start in between ) before actual de-install completes ( if then ) . Often times , one has to manually get into various directories to delete folders . If one 's desktop happens to be an HP as well , then good luck figuring out whether a particular HP folder should be deleted or kept . Sometimes one has to make changes in the registry in order to totally get rid of HP software . Hard to believe , but it 's true.4 . If you run into problems with this printer , do n't call for support . And absolutely do not use their chat line ( staffed by entry level technicians ) . Now and then I get a good HP support staff , but mostly they are reading over some generic manual on their end and give you adivce that is , at best , useless .	-1
I write with my left hand , but straight on the page like a right-hander , not `` over-hand . '' Most fountain pens work fine for me . However , this one is a real problem , because the nib is set in a straight line with the clip . I ca n't grip the pen properly and it 's awkward and immediately tiring to my hand . I 'm really sad about this , because I just love the idea of it , and other Pilot pens are terrific.As a leftie , I knew I was taking a chance with the pen . I 'm going to mark this with 2-stars to get attention for left-handers , but please do not take that to mean the product is less than extraordinary and best-in-class . It is . Mine is blue with gold accents and it is beautiful . The nib retraction is amazing.I will offer this pen to a couple of artistic family members who I 'm sure will give it a good and loving home . : )	-1
Wish I could return these-they run just like the others into surrounding colors . Used on muslin fabric project , will try on a firmer type of fabric	-1
first off , this is not what i paid for . I paid $ 10 to get a package of markers that only half of them work , and the colors are different than shown in pic . Though they might be & # 34 ; new in package & # 34 ; they are OLD and DRIED UP . 5 of the 12 dont even work , the rest are okayish but did not get colors shown . most are neon colored and hard to see anyway . SAVE YOUR MONEY , I WOULD SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE & # 62 ;	-1
-0 Star Rating ... This printer is the worst piece of junk ever produced . I knew that HP printers never last more than a couple of years , but I expected this one to last more than 4 months . Boy , was I wrong.I got a `` Replace Right Cartridge '' error ( just like numerous other reviewers ) . Wasted several hours on chat , had to call the 800 number . They sent me a `` refurbished '' unit almost 10 days later . I opened it , installed it right out of the box and it is DEAD ! Could n't even print one page . Wasted another couple hours on chat and with tech support ... I am dumping this printer and will sue HP if I have to , in order to get a refund . Will buy anything else but an HP for the rest of my life ... BE WARNED : DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER ! ! !	-1
So , you get a piece of paper in the box with this thing . It advertises Avery products , but it does n't tell exactly the step-by-step process for using it . I suppose it should be ovbvious , but I 've never used a CD/DVD label applicator and it 's not . I think I 've figured it out , but it would sure have been helpful just to have a HINT on the instructions as to how this gadget works.Oh..OK ... the instructions are on the labels themselves ! ! Now I feel better .	-1
The spindle in the middle is n't large enough to hold the label in an exact enough position to be sure you are n't off center . I can do as well or better eye-balling it . If you use the larger one , I expect it is fine as I have used those successfully in the past , but I used the smaller one and it is about 10 % too small to fit exactly without care you can apply without the device .	-1
The applicator works okay , but it 's essentially the same as a CD Stomper applicator I already had . The only difference is that the new one has a couple of slots at the edges to accommodate a change in the labels . For some reason , the smaller cylinder in the middle of the applicator is smaller than the small holes in full print labels , so the side slots help with alignment - except that the extra wings on labels rip off if you are n't careful removing the label from the sheet . It seems like all of that could have been solved with better engineering .	-1
I put two package opening tools on my Amazon Wish List recently , and two very kind folks gave them to me after recent hand problems left me struggling to open anything more complicated than a banana.The OpenX arrived today , sealed improbably in a clamshell . I took out theZibra Open-It ZPCOPEN-GZ 5-in-1 Package Openerthat had arrived last week to cut open the clamshell . Once the package was half-open , I pulled out the OpenX , and attempted to follow the directions on the remaining clamshell edge.The OpenX states , cut a 1 '' slit , then `` push and slide to get inside '' ( eeuw , I could n't make up these directions ) . The problem is that the blade jerks , and flies out of position , then you try again , and it makes another jagged cut . This leaves a perfect opportunity to get cut by that nasty clamshell plastic.I had a friend with normal hand strength try it - he was n't able to achieve any better result - the tool bucked and stalled , then flew out of position . We concluded that this is n't a safe or useful tool - far from my experience with the excellent Open-It .	-1
My wife bought this to open those annoying plastic clamshell packages . I wound up using a scissors instead . Here 's why.This product comes with a small retractable utility blade ( you can buy one for a dollar in Home Depot ) that barely extends . The theory is to use that blade to start a cut in the clamshell , and then effortlessly slice through with the fixed blade in the opening of this product . I tried it without success on a small clamshell package , and then just used an ordinary scissors , which worked fine.We keep this in the kitchen and use it as a utility knife to cut through the tape on packages , so it 's not a total loss , which is why I gave it two stars instead of one . But even a deluxe utility knife costs much less than this product , and also has a blade that is larger and protrudes further ( I own one ) and hence cuts more easily , not to mention that the blade is replaceable ( unlike the blade on this product ) .Bottom line : I did n't want to throw this out , so I am using it . But I would not recommend this to a friend . Instead I would tell a friend to look at the Zibra Open-It ( which I have reviewed on Amazon ) , which is a much better product . However , I would also tell a friend to look around his house to make sure that he does not already have a utility knife and a heavy duty pair of scissors or shears that will accomplish opening clamshell packages .	-1
This review is from : Smead Expanding File , Custom Printed Stock , Open Top , Jan-Dec Index , 12x10 Inch ( 70488 ) ( Office Product ) Vine Customer Review of Free Product ( What 's this ? ) I gave this product 1 star for a specific reason : Do n't tell me something is & # 34 ; leather-like & # 34 ; , and then send me a product that is made 100 % of paper products . The only thing & # 34 ; leather-like & # 34 ; about this product is that they printed a pattern on a piece of paper and then glued it to both sides of the folio . I wo n't reward a misleading product description in any way.Further , they made a design mistake on how they apply the & # 34 ; skin & # 34 ; they think makes it look & # 34 ; leather-like & # 34 ; . There IS a reinforcing material at the bottom corners of the file . However , the & # 34 ; skin & # 34 ; was glued on last , over the top of the corner reinforcement . It wo n't be very long at all before the glued down paper starts to separate at the corner , either from humidity or general wear . When that happens it will spread , and eventually the file will look pretty bad.I also think that the file should have been made just a touch wider . It is OK if all you want to do is dump receipts and pieces of paper into it . However , should you want to further organize your dividers by putting file folders into it , that is an issue . While you can get a file folder to slide into it , it is not at all convenient to do so , and it has to squeeze into the wider part of the section , where the accordion side is at its widest . If you want to put a few file folders in it , you 'll be out of luck . Even making this 1/8th inch wider would have eliminated that problem . If you 've ever put receipts into a file like this , and then tried digging around blind in the bottom trying to find and grasp them , you 'll appreciate how much easier it is to have them in a regular file folder that you can slide into one of these and then just pull it back out with the full contents.They make the claim that each pocket expands to 7/8ths inch . Maybe in their dreams . Yes , if you virtually pull the product apart to fully expand one pocket , sticking your hand all the way in to assist in flattening out the bottom , you could get it to extend to 7/8ths of an inch . It would n't stay there , nor could you conceivably expand EVERY pocket to that width.I 've had a similar accordion file from Globe Weiss for years which has a higher quality glossy exterior , IS wide enough to easily slide a file folder into , and has a fold over top which closes with velcro ... to keep you from accidentally spilling the contents of your file should you accidentally knock the thing off your desk . I would purchase that accordion file product over and over again and never consider this one in a direct comparison , and both are essentially the same price .	-1
When the description for the product said `` leather-like '' and `` desk-top organizer , '' I was expecting something heavy with some kind of faux- leather finish . This organizer is sturdy , but made from the same standard cardboard material most expandable files are made from . The `` leather '' design printed on the front and back is n't even slightly convincing or attractive . Very deceptive advertising.I found the organizer to be much too narrow , to hold much of anything , let alone it 's advertised 900+ sheets of paper . The pockets are not large enough to hold a file folder so I 'm always fishing around the bottom for loose papers . The open top is convenient , but the size and construction make it a fairly disposable item . Does n't really work for me .	-1
As with any ink cartridge , we are black mailed into paying way too much for what amounts to a small amount of ink . If not for the impact on landfills it sometimes is cheaper to buy a new printer then new ink .	-1
The cartridge worked alright so my complaint is the deceptive wording that hides the fact that it is a generic or refilled product .	-1
Despite being very happy with my HP Officejet 7310 , the ink has turned out to be a painful expense . In the past six months , I have gone through three of these cartridges . I hate to single HP out , but the entire inkjet industry is guilty of fighting price transparency with inexpensive printers and inflated ink . This is not to mention the constant changing of ink cartridges models . Does HP really need 200 different models of ink cartridges ? No . It would , in fact , be much cheaper to consolidate the cartridge offerings . However , this would lead to excessive duplication and remanufacturing by third parties.What is particularly amusing , and perhaps offensive to some , is the enclosed `` recycling '' envelope that comes with new HP ink cartridges . This prepaid envelope , with the empty cartridge , goes back to HP so that it can demonstrate its environmental leadership . Of course , HP does n't want the empty cartridges to go back into the hands of companies that refill and remanufacture them . Although I have n't done the calculations , I would assume the transportation and handling costs would actually do more harm than good to the environment . My suggestion is to fill the prepaid envelope with torn up remains of the consumer packaging that comes with the cartridges .	-1
Although users are quite happy with the printer , I would be hesitant with this printer purchase . What happens if you run out of one color ? You 'd have to buy a whole new color cartridge ?	-1
Not really a fan of these pen . I thought it was the gel model ... it turns out that just a basic pen	-1
As an early feminist with nearly 40 years of work history in Silicon Valley , enduring discrimination , misconceptions , glass ceilings , and harassment , I have accumulated life experiences and education and skills ( and a few extra lbs . too ) to the extent that I am quite certain I can not be squeezed into the economical 1 '' binder . And why does it have to be black anyway ? So that we `` women in binders '' can be shelved neatly and forgotten , eventually to be packed up and sent away to Datasafe ? I think not . I demand a 5 '' D-Ring binder with multiple index tabs and sturdy pockets and it needs to be fluorescent pink so that I can be bright and visible - it 's about time ! I deserve the biggest , boldest binder that Avery makes . I am not going to allow myself to be stuffed quietly into a nondescript economy version skinny black binder . We `` women in binders '' must unite to get what we deserve .	-1
As an employer in Boston , MA im always trying to diversify my catering business with equal numbers of woman and men . But as time passed , the women became more educated and left my business for more skilled jobs outside of the kitchen . So when i found out that i can find some women in binders , i immediately jumped on the opportunity . I bought two dozen of these binders expecting them to be full of women and even shipped them via 1-Day Amazon Prime shipping ! When i got my package from UPS i noticed that the box was a little smaller than i expected . Once I fully opened everything , to my surprise i saw that the binders were completely empty . I called Amazon customer service immediatetly and got connected to an agent from India , who seemed very confused when i tried explaining to her that my binders were missing the women i was told about . So unfortunately it looks like i was deceived by some guy named Willard on TV in regards to these binders : /These binders maybe good for a couple papers but lack the women i was told about . I hope amazon is understanding and refunds me when i try giving them a call again tomorrow	-1
Likes : > Good , strong , '' Extra Heavy Duty motor '' makes sharpening pencils a breeze. > Designed for `` Daily Continuous Usage '' . > Intended for `` Office Use '' . > '' Pencilsaver '' prevents over-sharpening and waste. > Auto-reset to prevent motor burnout. > Relatively quiet.Dislikes : > VERY small/volume-challenged shavings receptacle/tray. > Only one standard sized opening for # 2 pencils. > Shavings tray is part of the front cover ; the weak plastic may not withstand repeated removal/reinstallation. > $ 50.29 for this ? > Long term durability ? Bottom Line : Lots of promises but failed to deliver on some crucial points : A high usage , heavy duty office pencil sharpener should have a much bigger shavings tray . Repeated emptying of the puny shavings tray may weaken/damage the weak plastic and attachment points . It does n't require a rocket scientist to design an effective pencil sharpener ; just good common sense !	-1
It arrived yesterday and so far I love it . To those stating they sharpen 20-30 pencils at a time I 'd say , ease off and slow down . Give it a rest . And the included slip clearly states not for use in sharpening waxy type soft art pencils . The catch tray for the shavings is not huge , so remember to empty it regularly . I do laugh ... they call this Heavy Duty . My old Boston sharpener was also 2.0amps , same as this one , was 1/2 the size , and not labeled heavy duty . Prices have gone up . This one is twice what I paid for the old one , but it 's 15 years later , after all . This appears to be high quality and should last for a few years . UPDATE 3/2012 : Here it is a year later . It still works fine , but very noisey . Did try some machine oil on the gears but noise continues . I expected it to last longer than this , more quietly . ADDITIONAL UPDATE 6/2012 : The noise continues and is getting worse . I would not buy this brand again .	-1
For a pencil sharpener , I would give it five stars as it sharpens about as well as any I 've tried . However , I placed it on a wood table , and noticed yesterday there are black rings from the rubber feet which have stained the wood and would not come up no matter what I tried . I am very upset as this was nice wood . So if you buy it , place something under it before putting on a wood desk ! ! !	-1
This one is going back - after about a month of moderate use it just stopped working . The other reviews I read were so good , and i was disappointed .	-1
I purchased this item July 18th and finally got it today . When I put in a pencil nothing happened , I tried 2 other outlets which were both working and nothing . I should have listened to the other reviews and stayed away from what they called junk.X-Acto 1744 Heavy-Duty Electric Pencil Sharpener , Black , 1 Unitupdate nov. 15th 2012 had replacement sharpener for months now works fine .	-1
I have used a Hunt Boston pencil sharpener for years . The Hunt Boston sharpener is relatively quiet and efficient . I think we have used it for at least five years or more . I am also a huge fan of X-Acto knives . I have a bunch of X-Acto knives along with dozens of blades . X-Acto brand knives and blades are great for woodworking , building plastic models , and other hobbies . Thus , I was excited to try a pencil sharpener from X-Acto.The pencil sharpener looks like a high quality product . It feels solid and sturdy and rests firmly and flatly on my workbench . I was initially impressed and almost ready to sharpen pencils . Before I did , I removed the tray that holds the wood shavings . The tray seemed a little cheap , but hey , it is a plastic tray to hold trash , so how fancy does it need to be ? The problem came when I tried to put the tray back into the pencil sharpener . The tray would not go back into its slot.Surely , I was doing something wrong . I took the tray back out to make sure I had not missed some sort of adjustment that needed set to get the tray back into the sharpener . After all , I am a typical guy and I only read the instructions after figuring out how something works , if ever . However , I had not missed anything . The problem is that a plastic prong on the back of the tray , which I think engages a safety switch that enables to sharpener to work only when the tray is in place , did not properly mate with the hole . It takes some jiggling of the tray to get it in place each time I remove it . The inability to easily mate with the pencil sharpener subtracts one and a half stars.After finally getting the tray back into the pencil sharpener , I was ready to sharpen a pencil or a bunch of them since I seem to accumulate dull pencils on my workbench , where I do not have a pencil sharpener . Into the sharpener went a pencil . The good news is that the sharpener did quickly put a nice point on the end of my pencil . The bad news is that I thought the sharpener was broken . The sharpener makes a horrible grinding noise every time I sharpen a pencil . In contrast , my Hunt Boston sharpener makes a humming noise when the motor operates . The X-Acto sharpener seems to be working well ; it is just relatively noisy compared with my current Hunt Boston , and a former electric sharpener that the Hunt Boston replaced . The noise is also obnoxious and sounds like something is operating in a way it should not be operating . I subtract a second star and a half for excessive and unnecessary noise , which may be an indication of something that may break in the long term.I must to admit to some disappointment . X-Acto is a brand I associate with high quality . The shaving tray is hard to install and the motor sounds like grinding gears . It is possible that my pencil sharpener is defective . However , I would have thought that routine acceptance testing would catch a defective product prior to shipment . That leads me to believe that X-Acto considers this product typical production . If that is the case , I have to recommend against purchasing this product.I looked at the ratings on Amazon for this product and , unsurprisingly , learned that this product has many one and two star ratings . The one and two star ratings tell a story . Many of the ratings are because the sharpener failed to sharpen either well or at all . Many of these ratings are because the sharpener failed immediately or within days , weeks or months of purchase . What I wonder is whether someone thought it might be a good idea to involve Amazon Vine reviewers in the hope that Vine reviewers might be more favorable . If that was the thought , the thought was in vain because I am only slightly more impressed than previous reviewers are.I hoped the X-Acto name was an indication of the quality of this product . It is not . I am disappointed with the shavings tray and with the noise level and the type of noise . This product does not seem to me like it is going to be durable and without changes , I would not buy this product again . Because I would not purchase this product for quality and performance reasons , it automatically receives two stars.Good Luck !	-1
This has 1/2 the tape of 3m/scotch available at sams club . I mean VERY LITTLE tape actually exists on this dispenser	-1
I bought some of this brand of tape to save some money compared to that other leading famous brand of clear sealing tape . What I got were rolls of tape that looked the same but were brittle . That means that the tape split as I was pulling it off the roll , making me pick at the strip still sticking to the roll and starting it over . I wasted so much time with this tape that I made up my mind to pay extra and buy that other leading brand that I never had this problem with.The only way I can qualify this review is that perhaps the rolls I got were too old to be sold . Perhaps they had been in storage too long . But after what I 've been through using this tape , I ca n't bring myself to buy it again .	-1
All I can do is second the reviewer who wrote & # 34 ; Do not buy this tape if you value your sanity. & # 34 ; It is almost impossible to use due to constant shredding whenever the roll needs to be re-started . Even setting aside the hair-pulling level of frustration involved in working with it , the shredding wastes a ton of the tape -- you end up having to throw out feet and feet of it in order to get back to a full-width piece and start working again . This is just a horrible product , worse than some of the no-name store brands I 've tried . I 'll be sticking withScotch brand packaging tapefrom now on , and I regret buying even one roll of the Duck .	-1
Ink is all dried out and faded.Have to press HARD into the paper to make a definitive mark.No wonder these are all on sale and filling up all the aisles in dollar stores.Because they suck ! Zebra name but worse than cheapy no name stick pens .	-1
I wish I could give these pens a good review - I think they are so nice looking , they have a good grip , and I like how they write . However , I consistently have difficulty actually keeping them writing . Multiple pens in the pack have abruptly given up working within a week of being purchased . I can see there is plenty of ink in the barrel , but nothing comes out . Very frustrating .	-1
Ordered these in two sets , and it took a pretty long time to get them - about 2 weeks . Should 've just bought them locally because this was a ripoff . I got the plastic holders , but no labels so had to spend time making my own . Not really a deal breaker , but the deal breaker was the quality of these . It 's like they were rejects or something from a big office supply place because sometimes I could n't even insert the plastic label holders into the slots . Would never order from this seller again .	-1
First of all , it is NOT automatic ! So if you are wanting an automatic drafting pencil , you need to look else where . The pocket clip is made out of folded beer-can metal . Considering the price , I expect a much better pencil from Pentel .	-1
Nice file system but papers fall out too easily . One false move and everything falls out because the sides are open . I would love the product if the sides were enclosed . I want to use it yo stay organized for taxes but rubber bands or clips will need to be used or I foresee all my filing efforts will be negated if this falls on the floor or out of my hand . Very nice quality materials .	-1
I poured 128 fluid ounces of Tuscan Whole Milk into this and it leaked all over my fridge.A poor quality product !	-1
After reading other reviews , I too purchased this binder expecting hold my women . I was greatly disappointed . I 'm starting to think this binder only holds women 1 % of the time . The other 99 % of the time it tries to make me eat the pink slime ( I refuse ) , tells me that my college degree is elitist , dips into my retirement fund to feed undeserving billionaires , and keeps cleaning the dishes long after I finish.Save yourself some money and hold onto your women some other way .	-1
I 'm very disappointed with Avery . My son has had this binder for almost exactly a month . He uses it for school every day . It turns out Avery Durable is not so durable . It 's already falling apart . The cover is separating from the spine . I went back to buy another binder . This time , I made sure not to buy Avery Durable .	-1
This was to be a replacement for the one I lost . The pen that was sent me was second hand at best , like they are sending out the rejects and calling them `` new '' . The parts on this pen did not match in color , many different shades of red , streaks in the bottom barrel enamel finish . There is no way this is a first run , top quality item even though it is falsely advertised as one . Clearly this is a reject from the company that did not meet the requirements that is being passed of as brand new . I would not recommend buying this item as such , you will likely get a second run inferior pen .	-1
This pencil is tiny which makes it not very comfortable to write with . I ended up giving it to my son who likes the way it looks ... but he also noted that it 's small in his hand ( he 's a teenager , so his hands are adult-sized ) . Maybe good for someone with small hands but not for us.-D	-1
Pencil is nice heavy weight feel to it , the cap is a gorgeous color , however the back half of the pencil is a cheapo plastic that does not even come close to being the same color as the metal cap . They should have made it the same material . This is an expensive pencil and should be 100 % made of metal not half plastic .	-1
Really disappointed at this refill . I mean , I do n't think this is the real Parker . The print on the metal surface of the refill is kind of unclear and oily . Seems like a cheap fake one . I tried both the refills in the package , and after a few pages writing , and by page I mean , just small memo pads , it stopped working . There is no sufficient ink coming out , I get very weak blue and white lines on paper , just as if you have already used it up ! Both refills in the box works like that . Could n't believe it . Just throw them away .	-1
Well I like all parker pens and the gel is the best but on this order all but one refill have the little wax tip off this made the ink dry out so 5 of the 6 I ordered where no good shame others i had gotten have been ok this was the first with them dried out this bad . I am glad I still had one left from other order not sure but i think I will go to office store for my next ones .	-1
Dry out too quickly .	-1
I bought a white board that came with one of these markers and I thought it was ingenious but when I purchased this pack from Amazon , the markers were very poor quality . Though I have no complaints about the handy eraser or magnet function , writing with the markers was a useless venture . The brand-new markers wrote like very well-worn dry-erase markers even when pressing down firmly .	-1
We have a white board that the kids play with and I thought these markers might be good because they each have their own eraser ... no more fighting over the eraser . But these markers seems harder to erase than other we 've used and the erasers do n't cut it . Two fell off the first day we used them and one is flaking into bits .	-1
I was excited to get these because I like bright colors , and because I keep a family whiteboard calendar that I like to color code ( do n't judge , I 'm fussy ) . Unfortunately , they are a disappointment on a number of levels.They SMUDGE : The tips are not fine , and seem cheaply made , almost frayed . I ca n't write cleanly or clearly with them.They SMEAR : When you try to erase with the attached erasers , they smear . You need a real white-board eraser , and sometimes you need white-board spritz cleaner too . The attached erasers are useless.They are SHODDY : The magnets are weak , which makes the markers slide off and/or get knocked off easily . The erasers are not only useless , but they fall off after a few days use . The whole kit is cheap , like something from the dollar store . Or a cereal box.Bottom Line : 2 stars for bright colors and the fact that they are functioning markers . They will not work for you if you do a lot of erasing , or need to write detailed notes with them , or use your white-board frequently . Another reviewer wrote that they would work for a dorm room style , cheap memo board , and that 's probably true- though you would trash the whole thing in a month when the marker residue could no longer be erased .	-1
I was pretty disappointed with these dry erase markers . First , when taking them out of the plastic bag they were housed in - I grabbed two by the eraser at the top and the erases came off ! They were n't attached to the cap at all - simply placed inside the came , meaning the erasers will soon be lost.Secondly - the magnets did n't stick very well on some of the markers . Meaning - they would n't stay attached to my dry erase board . So basically - the two best selling points of the markers did n't work well at all.The markers themselves worked well enough - they draw in a thin line which is great for us as my kids do a lot of school work on our dry erase board . The marker makes a line more similar to a pen you might use , so this would be great for a personal lap dry erase board or again - practicing school work on a dry erase board.The markers are small - probably 3/4 the length of the more common dry erase markers.But , the cheapness of the magnets and the erasers not being properly attached would keep me from purchasing or recommending these markers .	-1
I was so excited to see these cute colors on sale . I got them to use on the easel in my first grade classroom . I was really happy that they had magnets . The magnets did not support the weight of the marker . No biggie , I just kept them on the easel ledge . I would n't have minded that if they 'd only worked . First Day of School came ! My brand new markers would look so beautiful on my white board easel ... if they were n't all dry . The yellow was the only marker that was n't almost entirely dry , but the color was so light the children could n't see it . My six cute markers went into the trash on day one and I pulled out a blue expo . Ho Hum , right ?	-1
I like the built-in magnet that holds the pen to the whiteboard , but that 's about the only thing I liked . When I used these pens to write on my board , but the marks were n't dark enough to read . I tried cleaning off the board , to see if that would help , but then the markers would n't write on the board at all . Sadly , I would not recommend these markers .	-1
The colors on these markers were bright against a whiteboard , which is good because I have difficulty seeing things written on a white board from a distance . What I did n't care for was that the magnets had no power ... the markers were constantly on the floor - and because I have two puppies , I now have purple dry erase marker that I am trying to remove from the carpeting in the front room - the marker dropped off the board while I was at work and apparently it was similar enough to a chewy stick to have been fair game.I admit to never having been a fan of the eraser on the back of the marker cap - and I 'm still not . I 'd rather just use a regular eraser then have that bulky thing on the back of my pen while I struggle to write legibly ( I 'm a lefty , dry erase is not my friend ) .If you are buying for the size and colors - these are fine . If you are buying for the magnetic properties , I would look elsewhere .	-1
I was really hoping for some bright , easy to use markers for my son 's dry-erase board to prompt his creativity . The package came with six dry-erase markers , complete with mini-erasers on the tops.My son enjoys using them , but we found the colors are not as vibrant as we would have hoped , and the point of the markers makes the lines pretty thin , so it is n't as easy to draw big and bold . He 's still pretty happy with them overall . The eraser tops work to a point , although often we get out the big dry erase eraser instead so that it 's not so time consuming . They have n't dried up yet , much to their credit , since getting my son to put the tops back on can be a challenge ! These are probably fine for a small board , but would n't be as effective for a large dry erase board that needs to be seen at a distance -- you 'd likely want sharper colors and a thicker point.Happy Drawing ! ^_^	-1
The Quartet ReWritables Mini Dry-Erase Marker set is a great concept but poorly executed.Pros : None that I can think of ... Oh . How about this : The black marker writes dark enough that it can be read from across the room . Whooo Hooo ! And , wow , I just thought of another one : The erasers work ! Stunning accolades , for sure.Cons : The yellow might as well be invisible , and the rest of the colors are too pale to be read from more than a few feet away . As I noted above , the only marker that can be read from a distance is the black.The magnets are so weak that they are close to being useless . I have aQuartet ReWritables Daily Quick Liston my refrigerator door , along with the black marker . When the door is closed the marker slides down the door and drops onto the floor . I tested the magnets on the other markers and they were just as bad . The only solution that I can see is to super-glue a decent magnet to the black marker.Disappointing , to say the least.Update , June 2014 : Even after I glued the magnet to the black marker , I was still not happy with it . Within a very short time the color in the marker faded , as if it was already running out of ink . I ditched the set and replaced it withLow-Odor Dry Erase Markers , Ultra-Fine Point , Assorted Colors , Set of 8 .	-1
I previously gave the markers four stars , but after using them for a longer amount of time , I 'm giving them one star . Like I said in my previous review , the colors are too light , and they are also pretty tiny . If you keep your board on the refrigerator like I do , then the markers will fall off if you shut the door . The blue one fell off one day , and the magnet broke off . What REALLY made me mad and why I 'm giving this a one-star rating is that it permanently stained my board . I 've tried using the erasers , I 've tried using water and scrubbing at it with a paper towel , but the marker stains just wo n't come off ! I 'm very upset . Now , I have to buy a new dry erase board !	-1
But not such a great product . I thought having the eraser on the end of the marker was a great idea -- and it is . In reality , though , it does n't totally erase the color from the board , just spreads it around . The board still has to be wiped down after use.Regarding the magnets , none of them are strong enough to hold the markers to the board . That makes the entire purpose of the product 's design pointless.Also , the ink is very light . It 's visible , but not very bold at all . Even at a moderate distance , it would n't be visible on the white board.I would n't purchase these again , and I do n't recommend them .	-1
The product work ok. You can tell they are cheaply made , but they do the job.When I received the package the entire case was cracked open and the thumbtacks were spilling all over the box , some had even poked through the sides of the box . This made it sort of dangerous to open this box and I did n't end up using these tacks every much since they did n't have a container .	-1
It 's so frustrating when the drawers fall off the track . For $ 40 , this looks really cheap . I love the color and it matches my bathroom decor , but it 's not functional . I keep my makeup in it and it just brings chaos to the room because ( usually ) three drawers are off track . When I 'm getting ready in the morning , the last thing I want to spend my precious time on is re-aligning the drawers . URGH ! ! !	-1
This this is a huge dissapointment . Not sure what it is supposted to be used for , but it does not hold much weight at all . I set it up to hold my beading and wire bending supplies . Admittedly , like most beaders , I am a bead hoarder . Even so , while the beads physically fit into the drawers , the drawers dropped from the tracksThe frame is some kind of metal but it feels like plastic . There are much better products out there for slightly more . I 'm sorry I got cheap on this one . I really do n't like it .	-1
This is a good little fax machine , however , you can not fax very large quanites at once . I would say no more than 10 , which is fine if it is not being used as your only fax . It does fax quickly and is very easy to use . ******Update*********DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY . Shell out the extra money to get something better , I would not recommend a brother fax machine . Ever . The ribbon goes out after making maybe 20 copies , which takes forever , by the way . I will be trying to get my money back . As I said before , you can fax up to ten pages , sometimes . When this piece of junk has a mind to , or so it seems . I bought a Cannon 3-in-1 fax , printer , scanner and love it ! So worth the extra money ! This fax machine is not even reliable , because it says the fax goes through , but then it actually does not . This happened to me on more than one occasion . You have been warned ! ! ! ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.P.S.Here 's an added nugget . Brother customer service will NOT assist you when they find out you have non-brother replacement part . Example , a non brother ink or non brother drum . While I did not call Brother customer service with this fax , the brother printer I had would not install properly to my computer , and once they knew I had a non Brother ink cartridge in , they refused to help me . They said they could not guarantee that the printer would function properly , without a brother ink . If you have looked at prices for Brother brand ink and other printer replacements , you can see why one would look elsewhere . And they WILL find out that you have a replacement . I did not volunteer the information , but they verify serial numbers on some parts before they will proceed with assistance . So Brother refused to help me with a non-printing related issue basically because they want you to shell out your hard earned $ $ $ $ $ for their JUNK .	-1
The machine feels fragile and goes through the carbon ribbon quickly . After six months of very limited home use , I am hearing a squealing-grinding noise when feeding the fax for a send ... I am not sure that the unit will make it a full year . I regret buying it . There are better machines out their for the same money ... find one with a refillable cartridge . Conditionally Recommended	-1
Being used on a Mac . Not a smooth operating printer ; loud [ who cares as long as it prints ] , must use exactly the right paper or it clogs up and then you have the devil to pay . Tip over the machine , engage in a treasure search for the offending paper to find where it stuck , yank it out , reboot and watch the red light , and watch and wait . Highly sensitive and unforgiving ; have not even tried to network it . What is the right weight of paper is anyone 's guess . Heavier , better .	-1
These permanent markers are pretty bad ! The colors do n't match the caps ! They are really thick , unlike Sharpies . If you need permanent markers , STICK WITH SHARPIE ! !	-1
My mistake ... I thought I was getting 48 different colors but this package is for 6 packages of 8 markers each . Please read the description before buying !	-1
I was very hopeful for this marker set , and impressed with its presentation and packaging . It has great fold out packaging , making all colors easily accessible and organized.That 's where my good impression ended.Perhaps it 's because I have , for 20 years , worked with professional artists ' mediums , but I am accustomed to consistency and accuracy in color swatching for my inks and paints . The color swatching for these pens is `` off '' , to say the least . Do not trust the lid to equal the shade of the ink in the pen . For some colors , it was quite accurate ; for others , not at all ( and I was tempted to switch some of the lids to better match the colors inside ) . If you get these pens , create a test-sheet on pure white paper , so you can have a better color map for the pens.As I tested each color , I found the consistency of the tips of the pens to be lacking . Some gave me a heavy , thick line , and others a very thin one . Some ebbed and flowed with the ink distribution . ( With same angles and pressures applied . ) This can be problematic while working on a project.The ink levels/dryness also varied a LOT . Some pens gave a heavy consistent ink line , while others seemed dry right from the start . Others gave something in between , as the ink levels came and went . The lighter colors seemed to be lacking in ink distribution more than the darker , richer colors , but even that was n't consistent . Again , if you end up with these , a test-sheet of paper will remind you which colors are heavier in distribution than others.I ran these pens through the wringer , using them heavily to see how they lasted , and again , the life of each pen seemed to differ greatly from the others ( but the dryer beginners did die faster , which I expected ) . None lasted as long as competitors ' brands that I have used.If you need some pens for a quick , disposable or of lesser-importance project , then these might be a good choice ( if they are cheap enough ) . But if you 're looking for quality pens for a project that holds any weight , then there are better choices.I 'm disappointed that I have to write this review as is . I was very hopeful that these would be a quality product . I would not purchase these , except maybe for a child who was doing a quick science fair poster or something along that line .	-1
This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen . It wastes all of the ink colors even if you are only printing black text . It can not be made to print black text if it is out of ink in any of its colors . It pumps its ink out in a ritual cleaning process that you can not limit . My favorite problem is that it has trouble grabbing a sheet of paper from the hopper . The message is `` media out or not loaded correctly '' will be displayed and there is no fix for it . I can have fresh paper in it and after printing several sheets in secession it will miss feed and after several miss feeds it will get back to printing . We need a lemon law for this printer .	-1
I purchased this item believing it to be fully compatible with Mac OS X . However , I was unable to get it to work at all under Mac OS X 10.4.6 -- nothing but chittering feedback sounds . I emailed the manufacturer directly about the problem , and they responded , `` Unfortunately we do not currently have a timeline for MAC OS X 10.4.6 support . We are sorry if your OS is OS X 10.4.6 and would like to suggest that you return the MV100 to the retailer where you purchased the MV100 . '' Disappointing !	-1
This thing has ghastly sound quality , on par with the cheapest , worse little vintage transistor radio . The only reason I kept it was I needed something in a hurry to finish out an online class after my headphones died , and all the headphones I 'd tried were not only garbage , but uncomfortable garbage . With this , at least , I did n't have to wear it on my head.It is roughly the size of a deck of cards , so it is portable . But I really ca n't in good conscience recommend this . If you have any familiarity at all with quality audio gear , this will drive you bonkers .	-1
I did like this pen on and off . It would write really nice at times , than other times it would dry up or be very thick . I am unsure of why I experienced a lot of inconstancy with this pen . When it started flowing wrong I would just grab another pen , but this last time I was in the middle of completing some math when it just went out.Unreliable . I would not purchase again or recommend .	-1
These pens have lovely colors and I was hoping for fine but they are so fine that they 're difficult to enjoy in my case.I wo n't buy them again & do n't enjoy writing or printing with them .	-1
The paper used in these envelopes is cheap and flimsy . When I pulled one envelope out of the box it drooped on both sides of my fingers . These are not worth anything and do not suit my needs . Think before purchasing .	-1
So i read all the negative reviews but I said to myself , how could any company design a bad sharpener after decades of sharpeners right ? Well , guess what ? This is absolutley the worst sharpener i 've ever encountered , but at the same time it looks great ! so if you want a 2 pound paper weight then go right ahead and buy this : ) I opened the box , pluged it in.. first off there is only one blade , and you 'd think that sould be enough rihgt ? well , it turns out , it only sharpens one side of the pencil exposing the lead tip ... . so you figure you could just rotate while you sharpen right ? but you ca n't because you have to push so hard that the pencil will slip out of your fingers.. what a pain . So after trying this for 5 pencils , on my 6th pencil ( none of the tips were cut correctly ) it stapped sharpening pencils all together ! So i returned it . I 'm gon na fork over about $ 50 for a double blade sharpener like I should have to begin with.Do n't say you wase n't warned .	-1
The Good : It 's powerful . And it 's quiet , for a pencil sharpener . So it lives up to that part of its promise.The Bad : It 's hard to keep pencils from spinning as I hold them in the sharpener . The motor and blades aggressively shake the pencil from side to side , and you need a Kung-Fu grip to hold on . I could deal with that , since the powerful motor and sharp blades at least work quickly . However , every pencil that goes in this machine comes out with one side of the point still covered with wood and the other side very deeply exposing the lead . I have another pencil sharpener that never does this , and I tried the same pencils on both my regular sharpener and this one , so I know it 's the machine and not the pencil . Also , the shavings tray is pretty small.The Ugly : Actually , this is one of the most attractive pencil sharpeners I 've seen . It has everything going for it ... if only it could sharpen a pencil properly .	-1
This sharpender is not really that good . My pencils do n't get a nice sharp at all . I already messed a few pencils trying to work this thing .	-1
I must say I was a little disappointed in this Stanley Bostitch pencil sharpener . I expected more than one blade just from the weight of the sharpener . It seems like a very heavy duty one and has a nice sized shavings dispenser . However , the pencils come out sharp all up one side but the other side does n't have the wood pulled back from the lead at all . We have found we have to manually rotate the pencil while it is in the sharpener to get an even sharpening . It 's a little inconvenient since that does n't always work either .	-1
Magic Tape is truly invisible and quite durable , perfect for wrapping presents . What bothers me , though , with this particular product is this : the tape dispensers are large , used only once and have far too little tape in them to justify this kind of waste . I prefer to get my tape at art or office supply stores in large rolls , which I place in permanent dispensers . Costs less , wastes less , and I buy less often . This three-pack is not recommended .	-1
I use a different style letter opener at work and feel in love with it . I ordered this and was disappointed that I tears the envelope instead of 'opening ' it . Would not recommend !	-1
I had this printer for 20 months and used it very rarely . Even before the starter toner cartridge ran out , the printer died . One day it just stopped printing , the thing got very , very hot ( burned my fingers ) and died.I 'll never buy another Samsung printer .	-1
Edited to say that they no longer support Macintosh very well , so I 've gone back to the Smart Label printers , which are awesome ! They are easy to use and totally no-hassle . Dymo has been a completely full-hassle experience for the last several years . I 've spent money on 3 machines only to have them stop working , with no way to fix them , because they are no longer supported . I wo n't make that mistake again.Previously I had written : I use my Dymo LabelWriter for the normal tasks such as making labels for mailing envelopes , file labels , etc.My friends and family ( and people in stores ) laugh when they see me pull out my 'notes ' which are all on labels.My grocery list is on labels.My LIFE seems to be printed on labels in one way or another . People could read my labels and get a good idea of who I am and what I do.When my LabelWriter wears out , I 'll be getting another Dymo LabelWriter to replace it . It just does n't wear out though .	-1
I bought this because I do a lot of packing because I send a lot of care packages to my family between the ones that are in the military , overseas or out of state and because I sell things on eBay as well.I was looking for something that would make my life much easier when packing a box/parcel and would help me tape boxes much faster , well to say the least this definitely does not do that ! I used it several times and tried my best to mess around with it so I can give it a chance but that did not change my opinion one bit , I was going to return it because it frustrated me so much but instead I threw it away which made me much happier.My first problem with this would be that probably because I have small delicate hands this thing was way to cumbersome and clunky for me to be able to manoeuvre around as smoothly and quick as I wanted/liked.My next issue would be the setting that you can & # 34 ; tighten or loosen & # 34 ; as much as you like/need the tape when packing something ... Politely put that is nonsense ! It is either way too tight making it possible to even pull the tape and in some cases even ripping it or its way to loose and the tape just goes everywhere , there are bubbles instead of smooth lines , the lines are all over the place instead of a straight consistent line and the negative list here is endless.The balance of the head compared to the handle is way off making you excrete even more effort to keep it straight , pull , cut , etc . and making your wrist feel like it will pop out of place any moment.Another extremely annoying issue with this tape dispenser is the impossible task of actually cutting tape where you want/need it to . I would not consider this a safety feature for any age because from where I was standing it was more of a safety hazard and a threat rather than a convenient safe feature as they advertise it.The only cool thing about this tape dispenser is the shark design and grey color which makes it stand out from the rest of the standard ones.I would never recommend or buy this again !	-1
The tape is paper , but due to being self-stick tape , the surface is shinny to the tape does not stock to itself and thus can not be easily written on , which was the purpose for my buying the paper tape . Not a manufacturer problem , just not what I was expecting for paper tape .	-1
This thing is awful . The ( Macintosh ) software that comes with it is infuriating . The install process installs 5 programs , each of which asks for the same information , install drive , several `` next '' clicks and something I 've never seen -- after each install you must confirm to exit that installer.Try as I might I could n't get anything but dark , washed , grainy scans . I tried a software package called VueScan which was able to produce semi-reasonable scans where were merely dark and washed . However there was quite a lot of fringing , so much so that the software could not auto-crop correctly due to fringing which it detected as part of the image.I think this is a case of you get what you pay for .	-1
My employee bought eight of these things less than six months ago . One of them works . It no longer & # 34 ; snaps & # 34 ; the staple . When you push it down it just gently feeds a staple out the end . SEVEN of them are dead . WASTE OF MONEY	-1
Dymo 's website has a software download for Intel power Macs - this software does not work at all - even though the Mac `` sees '' the Dymo sitting on a USB port it can not print to it - after a friendly geek struggled with it for the better part of a hour it finally decided to print labels - even the geek does not know what he did to make it print - so - if it goes down - it goes to my physical trash bin - get with it DYMO - Macs are taking over the computer world	-1
I 've been through about four Dymo label printers.On the good side : these thermal printers do the job quickly and easily . I like the Dymo software ; it gets better all the time with every version . It allows you to ( reasonably ) customize labels , including putting a small graphic on your shipping label . The labels , though not inexpensive , are readily available from office supply houses and even online from postage services such as Endicia . You can now do internet postage , essentially printing your own stamps . You can also use it to create file labels , and other thermal labels ; however , be warned that thermal labels eventually brown up and fade , so I 'd suggest something like aBrother PT1290 Home and Office Labelerfor more permanent labeling.On the bad side ; these printers are not durable nor particularly well-designed . Once they break , they are nearly impossible to fix . I 'm a fairly good fixer-upper , and these just frost my , well , you know what.I enjoyed my Twin Turbo until the small metal lever on the right side refused to re-seat into its slot . This lever opens the roller to allow you to feed in new labels . I managed to reseat the lever , but then the labels fed improperly , and dug down under the roller and spun around , wrapping tightly around the roller . It was impossible , even removing the front , to remove the roller and peel back the wrapped labels . Then the lift lever failed . The printer was officially ... hosed.I 'd forgive this ONCE , but every Dymo printer I 've owned has eventually crapped out in under a couple of years . They are just not durable . I 'm bummed , because I loved this one -- it let me feed three part postal labels with delivery confirmation on the left , and internet stamps on the right . Very handy . I have not tried the 450 version of this model , and I hope it is better because this one was pretty feeble . I guess I 'd summarize by saying , they are great while they last . And I will probably buy another one , possibly theDYMO LABELWRITER 450 Label Printer , ( 1752264 ) , USB , PC/MAC , Printer and Software , 51 Labels Per Minute , black/silver. , if I can find one on sale because they are dead useful .	-1
As a computer consultant , this is such a pet peeve . Printer companies selling printers at megacheap prices so you can be gouged with ink . This has 5 mL of ink in this cartridge . Now , check out the HP 56 cartridge -- 19 mL for about the same price . Remember , it 's the same product inside -- ink.Think about it , if you buy this cartridge , you are getting $ 6 worth of ink for $ 20ish . Each new cartridge would be $ 14 you could have spent on a better printer .	-1
Although the quality of the ink is good , this cartridge holds only 5 mL of ink .	-1
Not worth the MOOLA or the MONEY ! ! these ink cartridges are substandard way of forcoing people to keep H.P . rich selling INK ... We all know there is a fuel shortage ? ... But an INK shortage ? ... Only with H.P .	-1
It 's ink ... it works . What else can I say except that these cartridges are overpriced everyplace I 've looked , and we go through them like water . I think by the time this school year is over we will have spent almost $ 800 on these stupid things !	-1
This is a genuine HP ink cartridge ... although it seems to run out rather quickly . I do n't know if HP is filling cartridges with less ink ; I had n't noticed the quantity levels . Even with lower online price , it still seems to be high priced . I will now compare quantities carefully for future purchases.UPDATE ( 8/10/12 ) : I guess this is really the only ( original HP ) choice I have for my printer . I love my printer ... great copying , printing and scanning abilities . Thank goodness I have n't printed too many photos or color documents . So , I do n't buy these cartridges too often but , I just bought another one here to save a little money at least .	-1
I am very disspleased with H.P . ink cartridges . They run through Ink like Crazy Horse Ran through Custer at the little big horn . in aboyut the time it takes a hungry man to eat his dinner.because H.P . has cut down the size of the ink cartridges . I will never buy another HP printer as I amm really ired of dropping $ 30.00 a pop for ink . and my m , achine has two carytrdiges both are always over $ 30.00 each do $ 60.00 for ink ... .Nie Wieder or translated ? ... . `` never again ''	-1
This mouse pad is not for me . The wrist rest pad is very large and very hard , and I found it uncomfortable . The mouse pad itself has some nice non-slip strips on the back to make it stable on the desk -- the problem is that once you put on the risers to give it a little bit of a lift on one end or the other , the non-slip strips are no longer in contact with the desktop and the mouse pad slips and slides all over the place . Because I was given this through Amazon Vine and did not have to pay for it , I will toss the wrist pad , and the little feet for lift and just use the mouse pad . Frankly , as it is , it is n't comfortable , or useful for me .	-1
This comes with a confusing set of equipment and an equally confusing manual printed in many languages . Well - the bottomline is I did eventually set it up and tried to use it but it seems a little too industrial for use . I would n't recommend it . This is not my first GEL WRIST PAD for mice but this one is just not too good because it 's not comfortable , easy to assemble and it does n't add or subtract from my experience of using my wireless magic mouse . Therefore I see no reason to buy this . Thank you.What could the manufacture have done to make it better ? I also have the `` 3M Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest '' and that has a nicer softer feel although it is a dust magnet , it actually adds utility and ease of use . The whole area of resting the wrist does n't do much for a home-user like me .	-1
This 3M adjustable Gel Wrist Pad is the WR421LE model which measures 7 1/2 by 10 ' and is made of rigid grey colored anti-microbial material which the manufacturer claims will inhibit bacteria growth and slow its degradation . This material is also supposed to cut down on energy costs and battery usage . It has a comfortable black leatherette wristrest that must be attached to the mouse pad and rubber feet that must be attached to the bottom to give it a front or back tilt . This is well made and may work for you , however I have the following observations.The mouse pad must be completely assembled with special pre-cut Velcro-type tape and the instructions are abstract diagrams which I found less than helpful . I had a very difficult time assembling it and if you screw up there are no extra little pieces of tape to correct one 's error . While I do spend extended time on my lap top , I do not have carpel tunnel syndrome and so it had a rather uncomfortable and unnatural angle for me . I have ended up continuing to use my old low-tech mouse pad but I did unattached the wristrest which is now resting at the bottom of the mouse pad and it works really well . As for energy savings , I have never replaced the battery in my ancient Logitech mouse and so I do n't see battery life as much of an issue here and I have never really considered mouse use to be an energy vampire .	-1
The 3M Tilt-Adjustable Gel Wrist Rest Platform claims that it encourages a comfortable , neutral wrist position . Like many people , I spend a lot of time on my computer so I 'm always eager to try out any product that helps with comfort and ergonomics . Does the 3M WR420LE 's performance justify the high cost ? Let 's find out.PLATFORMThe platform is the only feature that separates this product from plain wrist rests . It 's a strong plastic platform to place your keyboard onto . There 's space in front for the included padded wrist rest and two sets of rubber feet are also included . I assume the rubber feet are why 3M describes the platform as being adjustable , but I would n't call it truly adjustable since you ca n't adjust them on-the-fly.The rubber feet come in two sizes and attach to the bottom of the platform , using 3M adhesive . Attaching them to the rear of the platform for a positive tilt is easy , since there are templates , indicating where to put them . Every single keyboard I 've ever used , except for Kinesis Contour keyboards , had positive tilt feet/legs . The true benefit of the 3M platform is its ability to produce a negative tilt . Unfortunately , if you want the platform on a negative tilt , you 'll have to eyeball the rubber feet on your own ; 3M forgot to include templates for negative tilt feet.WRIST RESTThe included wrist rest is very , very nice . It has antimicrobial protection and is filled with a not-too-soft , but not-too-hard gel . The wrist rest is wrapped in a soft , leather-like material and is by far , the most comfortable and durable I 've ever used . I ended up just tossing the platform to the side and using the wrist rest by itself.CONCLUSIONMy experience with the 3M Tilt-Adjustable Gel Wrist Rest Platform was rather disappointing . It 's not truly adjustable and 3M failed to provide templates for accurately attaching the rubber feet for negative tilt . If not for the wonderful wrist rest that was included , I would have rated it even less . The thing is , you can buy the wrist rest by itself , for less than half the cost of this platform/wrist rest combo . I suggest you do just that and forget about the platform .	-1
As other reviewers have pointed out , this is not a truely adjustable product . Once you set the tilt ( if you choose to use tilt ) it is set and can not be re-adjusted . When I spend hours using my keyboard every day I like to be able to increase or decrease the tilt angle a little so my hands and wrists feel less tired . Remember the `` old-fashion '' keyboards with adjustable legs ? That was what I was hoping for . The gel wrist pad is also firmer than what I really like , there is some cushion to it but not much.The cost-to-benefit ratio of this platform is poor in my opinion . For the somewhat expensive price you do n't have true adjustment . If your computer is shared and one person likes positive tilt and the other negative tilt or tilt at different angles , this product is not for you . If all you want is a wrist rest you can find many here on Amazon at a fourth to a third of the price . The antimicrobial feature is n't particularly important to me although if it is to you , you can still find wrist rests with that feature for much less money.Sorry 3M , you make some fine products but this one is n't for me .	-1
The concept is solid ; an 'adjustable ' platform for your keyboard with a gel wristrest . Unfortunately the execution of the Gel Wrist Platform by 3M is somewhat flawed.Pros : Adjustable ( see cons ) incline of the platform . 5 - 10 degrees positive or negative incline.Plenty of room for most keyboards and preferred wristrest/keyboard positioning.Somewhat attractive.Does n't slide around on the desk.Easy set-up.Cons : Not really adjustable as most people think of adjustable items.Wristrest is far too firm.Leatherette cover feels odd , slippery when you sweat.Platform I received was not true/flat.Expensive.While the platform is adjustable it is n't something you can adjust over and over at will . It comes with two sets of rubber 'feet ' one small and one larger . Each adds 5 of incline either positive or negative ( though I can not imagine typing with negative incline ) . The feet glue onto the platform or each other . You stack both sets together to get 10 of incline . I do n't see the feet for sale separately anywhere so you 're pretty much stuck with your choice of height unless you want to go lower by removing them.I found the faux leather wristrest to be far too firm to the point of uncomfortable and almost causing discomfort/pain during use . I may continue to use the platform but I believe I will go back to using my old , soft , nylon covered wristrest . The wristrest is advertized as 'buttery soft ' do n't believe it.I do like the typing angle . I used the larger set of feet for a 5 positive incline of the platform and used the 2nd set of smaller feet to keep my Dell keyboard from sliding around . I like my keyboard offset a bit ( see posted image ) to the right and there was plenty of room to set things up the way I like . The platform I received seems somewhat darker than the one pictured ( that could just be lighting ) . What I received is a dark battleship grey with a light texture on it . There are rubber slip guards on the bottom to keep things in place on your desk.The platform I received was not true/flat and I had to prop up both lower corners . Every time I moved my hands it made an annoying tick-tack noise on the desk.All in all it is a good idea that just was n't completely thought out . Being rather expensive for what you get and compared to other similar products I would n't recommend this . You could probably make your own for half the price .	-1
This just did n't do it for me . I found it really bulky . If you 're using it in pullout keyboard drawer , it may not fit right . I did n't find it all that comfortable either . The gel pad was n't cushy enough for me . I like one with more give to it . They might as well have used hard plastic.And for the money , I definitely do n't endorse this product.Usually I 'm really happy with 3M products , this one just seems like a waste of materials .	-1
I can spend $ 100 on a new cartridge for my NEC laser printer , and get 2 years use out of it . OR , I can spend $ 25 on THIS cartridge for my Canon printer , and get two WEEKS out of it . Do the math . Canon ought to be ashamed of offering a product with so little actual output per dollar . Generally I LIKE Canon products a lot ( e.g . their cameras ) and so I am shocked at the short life of this cartridge .	-1
Costs too much . Dries up too fast . But that simply puts this cartridge in the same league as all other inkject cartridges . I only use my Canon inkject occasionally when I need color . At least one of the 5 cartridges is ALWAYS dried out .	-1
This is a terrible product . It did n't even fit into my printer . My printer is listed as the compatible printers . Check and make sure before you buy .	-1
it works of course , but the price is a ripoff and it does n't last long at all .	-1
The other 1-star reviews are right : this printer has serious problems feeding paper . Right out of the box , it had trouble feeding paper and often displayed an `` out of paper '' error message when paper was in the tray . I was able to get the printer to work most of the time by reloading paper and/or pressing OK multiple times , but eventually the printer just refuses to feed paper from the letter-size tray at all.I should note , the paper is HP-brand , specifically for use with this printer.It 's too bad , because otherwise the printer is great : fantastic print quality , outstanding speed , very easy setup for both Windows and Mac OS X . But all of this matters little when it wo n't feed the paper ...	-1
Pros : Decent document scanning in color or b & w . ; Glass has n't fallen into the scanner.Cons : Poor quality construction . I also get the screeching during scanning as reported by others . Recently it has started making a ratcheting sound as if the belt is slipping on the gears & does n't scan . A quick `` dope slap '' frees it and it will then scan.The software leaves a lot to be desired and is clunky to work with.I have had a scanner for nearly 20 years , and past ( Visioneer ) scanners have operated flawlessly . They only got replaced as technology improved or when driver support vanished on an OS upgrade . This one replaced a non-photo scanner as I was planning to scan those old negatives I have laying around . This has only had a little over 3 yrs . of fairly light use and it is trash . I could live with the lousy software , but the poor construction makes it unusable . I expected better quality from Epson , especially in light of its then- $ 200+ price tag . I am now searching for new scanner ... and it wo n't be an Epson .	-1
This product is VERY & # 34 ; flimsy & # 34 ; ; there is no back and the drawers slide out and spills contents when you pick the cabinet up . I would not recommend this , even at the very low price , and returned this .	-1
Okay , so in this line of products , not a lot to choose from , so in a pinch , this one 's pretty good - it 's cheap , and has a lot of compartments . But , it 's cheap . Very cheap ... ly made . The 39 compartments have little dividers that wo n't stay put to save your life , and what a pain when they get caught when you try to open a drawer , trying your best to get the divider out without breaking it ( which I 've done twice now ) , only then to have the extreme frustration of having whatever you had in that divided drawer , now all mixed together . Now you get the pleasure of separating whatever it was ... try that with finish nails ... aaarrgghh.That said , after searching and coming to the point of giving up , I 'm actually planning to find my round-to-it and , one of these days dump everything out , then get some darned glue and put those things in permanently . Then , I do believe it will at least restore some of my sanity about the unit .	-1
I had to send it back . One of the articulating arms was n't working properly so I could not adjust the height of the monitor .	-1
Stick with name brands . The quality of this product is lacking as there were ink lines missing where they should have been and splotches of ink where they should not have been . The quality is comparable to buying a notepad from the Dollar Store , except that the Dollar Store might carry a better quality pad .	-1
these labels are WAY expensive and not very sticky . I have since moved to plastic envelopes with a mega-sticky back ( like the kind fedex uses for airbills ) . I simply print the addressee info and insert in the evnvelope . MUCH cheaper and safer , and what you print out is protected from water , unlike these Avery labels . It 's an antiquated solution . time to move on !	-1
Have not used this cartridge so I am not rating this re-manufactured ink cartridge for its print quality . My rating reflects my dissatisfaction with this vendors deceptive advertising . This vendor is selling re-manufactured cartridges and most people would n't know it by looking at the items web page . What I have learned , if the item description does n't say OEM it is n't an Epson manufactured ink cartridge . I think if a vendor is selling re-manufactured ink cartridges it should be in the item description ! Some will say the price should tell you it is not OEM but a lot of vendors list a low price to draw customers and then recoup there losses with an elevated shipping cost !	-1
This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned . I have had it for barely 2 months and it is no longer working . The scanner stopped functioning after a month . Then the copier went out . And now the printer wo n't even turn on ! You have to have a separate outlet to provide enough power to run t he printer in the first place . Heaven forbid you need to use an extension cord or surge protector bar . If you ca n't plug it directly into the wall - Forget about it ! The paper does not feed properly no matter what . And to top it off ... I ca n't get it fixed . The nearest Canon repair is over 2 hours away and as far as mailing it back and forth to Canon and paying their fees it is cheaper to invest in a new one - I used to love Canon products but after the last two lemons ( this one and the MP360 ) that I got from them - I will be looking elsewhere ! I gave it 2 stars in my original review because it did print nicely when it was working . With this edited review it wo n't let me change the amount of stars I gave it but I give it ZERO.Do n't waste your money on this rubbish .	-1
I 've had this machine for about six months and find it very difficult to load the paper , plus it jams on a regular basis . Another annoyance is that you must remove the output tray to load the input tray . Even if you just want to insert one sheet of paper to say for instance print on the back of it you have to take out the output tray and then it takes too much time trying to insert that one sheet just right . Most of all I hate that I can not for all the world cancel a print project . Bring up the printer software and try to cancel that print job and it simply will not go away . Even after turning off the printer and the computer the next day when I turn them back on that sucker will go right ahead printing and wasting ink on the unwanted print job . For once I 'm glad these things never last more than a few years because I wo n't be sorry to see this one die . I dread having to print anything because of the fact that only one in three jobs go well . The more I use it the more I hate it .	-1
Bought this printer several years ago . Performance was average for an ink jet printer . Construction quality was mediocre-minus . For no apparent reason , one day , I found I could n't seat a replacement ink cartridge in its receptacle . Some of the innards has shifted around and it would n't accept the cartridge . HP support was hilarious . The poor chap that took my call had to walk me through all sorts of inane questions starting with : `` What version of drivers were we using ? '' . After about 30 minutes of walking through the bronzed block diagram he eventually agreed it was a hardware problem . And , to their credit , HP mailed me a replacement frame which did fix the problem .	-1
Ordered this machine impulsively when my old HP T45 began to sound like a machine version of the 'death rattle . ' It was a amistake . Poor scanning , slow printing , ink eating and- overall - a truly inferior product . I returned it and bought a Canon Pixma MP530 for about $ 60 more and am VERY pleased with it . I believe that HPs heyday as the premiere maker of domestic printers and multi-function machines is over.Do n't do what I did - Home work first , THEN purchase !	-1
I wish printer manufactuers would just charge a realistic price for their printers rather than always trying to kill us on the price of the ink . It 's often cheaper to throw away a printer and buy a new one than to get replacement ink for it . This stuff seems to last about 50 pages before it goes dry .	-1
I tried it on carpet , wooden floors , and ceramic tiles.The doorstop just slipped with the door . I returned it . Maybe someone else would have better luck with it .	-1
This cork board is very thin cork on a piece of cardboard , held together in a particle board frame . If any portion of the frame gets damaged the bulletin board is useless . If one corner gets damaged , the frame wo n't hold together . I thought cork boards were pretty standard , so I was pretty floored by how cheaply this one is made . Pass on this one . Look for one with a real wood frame ...	-1
The cork board arrived in a damaged state . That was n't the problem . In fact , that allowed me to see how it was constructed . There is an extremely thin layer of cork on top of corrugated cardboard . That is surrounded by a plastic composite frame . Drop it and see how easily it damages . I put a push pin into the cork and can see it coming out the back.I 'm giving it two stars because it is inexpensive and light . In most cases it is good that & # 34 ; they do n't make them like they used to. & # 34 ; Not in this case .	-1
This thing is made out of cardboard . The frame is some kind of composite something that broke in transit . It 's held together with metal pieces that do n't go back together it they break.Complete and utter waste .	-1
I would never , ever purchase this again , or recommend it to a friend . It 's light as a feather , and flimsy as can be . It even arrived chipped . Quartet actually gives you real hardware to anchor this POC to the wall ! Funny ... To further prove it 's low quality , my cat scratched it once and it easily ripped open . This thing is cheap .	-1
This product is defective ! The adhisive on this magnetic tape would not stick to anything and I tried it on 10 different surfaces . This product is also old and brittle , It cracked just trying to un-roll it .	-1
I purchased this toner for my Brother MFC-8860DN and it is supposed to print about 7000 pages . That 's a joke . I got perhaps 4500 , then got the message during a large print job : OUT OF TONER and the printer just stopped . Luckily , i saw the comments here from another customer who pointed out that a little tape over the round window on the right side of the toner cartridge will let you use the rest of the toner without being scammed by Brother . I tried it and it worked perfectly ! That is really the main complaint I have about this product . It works fine , but it is a scam . I will buy a generic toner cartridge available on Amazon this time and will see how that works .	-1
I 'm sure if you 're looking at this product you 're probably thinking the same thing I was thinking when I was looking at it . `` Three containers stacked on top of each other are a whole lot neater than three separate containers on your desk '' . I honestly had my doubts about the quality of the product just by looking at the picture but I decided to take a chance and buy it anyway . Unfortunately when I received the product my doubts were confirmed.This swivel tower is poorly designed and what 's even worse is that the build quality is also very poor . First off , the tower is n't even straight . Each container is slightly lopsided . It looks like each container is bent when hanging from the center post . You can clearly see this and I highly doubt that this is from a shipping defect because I tried to even bend them straight to no avail . Secondly , each container swings from side to side too freely . Ideally , I would expect a little more resistance because I do n't want each container swinging from side to side as it makes it easier for the tower to fall over . Lastly , the product itself just looks cheap . I have other mesh containers which I bought from Staples and I thought that this swivel model would complement them ... but I was wrong . Even thought this swivel tower is a mesh design , it does not match the quality of the other items I own . Fit and finish are just terrible on this model . Not to be cruel but this product looks like some amateur do-it-yourselfer put it together in their basement ( like one of those people who has a half finished basement . ) I contacted the third-party seller for a return and they just said to keep the item and they issued me a full refund . Right now this swivel tower is sitting in my basement . Maybe I 'll put it to good use down there but it just does n't meet my expectations as far as keeping it on my desk.I gave it two stars for the idea of a swivel tower . The product itself gets one star and I do n't recommend it . I certainly hope someone else can get this design right .	-1
I bought this for my office desk at work . I thought it looked so cool . It came pretty much assembled for you , but the quality is poor . It 's really flimsy and does n't sit flat . Next time , I 'll just go to the store and pick out a good one .	-1
If you were the only one sharpening pencils , you would eventually figure out the correct way to hold and push in the pencil so you almost always get a perfect point . But since this is a commercial sharpener , a lot of different people will use it and they are going to see inconsistent results.We placed it in a high school office for a week . It seems silly to say that sometimes it worked and sometimes it did n't . But that is true . Sometimes there was no problem . Sometimes people pushed too hard and never felt the change in the motor when done , thus eating the pencil down to nothing.Sometimes , the pencils did n't get uniform sharpening all the way around and left wood on one side of the pencil.The feeder ( the dial you can turn to adjust the width of the pencil ) is not very stable . It moves easily and it causes the pencil to just miss.One good thing is that the suction feet worked well and the sharpener does n't move when being used.I tried 5 pencils when I first got it , before I placed it at the school . The first two ended up as shorties . The next three were fine . My wife then tried two more . One was fine , one was not even.So like I said once you get use to it , you probably wo n't have many problems . But that is not good enough for an expensive commercial product.Find a different sharpener .	-1
In the past I had done some pencil sketching and have been considering taking it back up . I 'm a bit anal retentive about my pencil point ; I like it good and sharp . So when I saw this pencil sharpener I was interested . I could set it on a corner of my drawing table and refresh my pencil whenever it got too blunt , rather than having to get up every so often to sharpen again on my wall-mounted Boston.Unfortunately , I find it is good pretty much only for your garden-variety number 2 pencil which , indeed , it does put a nice sharp tip on . I was less successful with softer drawing pencils and also with colored pencils . Even with the nice sharpening job it did on the number 2 , sometimes it would sharpen to the nice precise tip , and other times it would only sharpen one side so that the opposite side had a sheath of wood on it.I must confess that once it did n't work on several of the different kinds of pencils that I already use , I did not try it out on other brands of pencils , or on larger pencils I was considering buying for shading purposes . Perhaps I 'm pushing the pencil or holding it at a tilt , although after the first non-centered pencil , I did deliberately try to insert the pencil as straight as possible.I have n't given up on it yet , but so far my old manual Boston does a more consistent job of sharpening straight .	-1
This sharpener is garbage . I purchased it for my classroom . I do n't allow the children to use it because I was afraid they would mess it up . Myself and another teacher sharpens the pencils every morning for our class . I purchased this in September 2011 and this is only Feburary 2012 . The shapener is not working already . This was just too soon providing only adults have been using it . We handle it with care . So I would not waste my money on this product . However , on a better note , Amazon did deliver this product quick . No reflection on amazon , but the product is just garbage . Do n't buy this sharpener . I ca n't afford to keep wasting money especially living on a teachers salary . If anyone knows of a good heavy duty sharpener , please let me know . This is my 4th sharpener I have purchased .	-1
I 've been using these Prismacolor Premier Soft Core Colored Pencils for a couple of weeks now . I am greatly disappointed with them . They 're difficult to sharpen evenly , even using Prismacolor 's special pencil sharpener . Much worse is that the lead has been broken inside the casing on every single pencil in the set , causing long chunks of lead to drop out of the sharpened end . This has happened to me at least twice with every pencil . I 'm pretty annoyed at having spent almost $ 73 on what is supposed to be a premium product ; in fact , I find Crayola and CraZArt pencils to outperform Prismacolor 's in every circumstance . What a huge disappointment ... I would not recommend this product to anyone and I regret having purchased them .	-1
I got these for my kid , but it keeps on ripping and so what was the point of getting these ? I 'm surprised because it had so many 5 star reviews , if anyone knows of stronger ones please let me know	-1
I thought this was going to be a kind of shelving system , but really it 's just a set of boxes with pull-out drawers that can be stacked on top of each other . The `` steel plus '' in the product 's name refers to one measly little square of metal that you stick into the box for limited support . Assembly of the boxes is not quite clear until you struggle with a box or two to figure out what 's supposed to be done . Overall , when it comes to file storage , even if you 're in a temporary location and need portability , I would not recommend this as an option .	-1
These are basically stackable cardboard ( reinforced ) storage boxes They are strong and well made , work pretty well , and get the job done . However , I think the price is *very* expensive for what you get . I use them in a walk-in closet and they work ok for that purpose .	-1
First , I really wanted to love this phone . It had every single feature that I wanted , plus more.However , after about 3 months the button-wheel ( not sure what to call it , the round selector thing in the middle ) stopped working when I pressed up . Then a few days later it stopped working when I pressed down . Then it stopped working all together . This is a huge inconvenience.Then the same thing started to happen on the second one . As of right now , the only way I can view caller id numbers is from the base.So I called Uniden . The customer service rep I spoke with was very snide and rude . She told me that these phones needed to be rebooted frequently like a computer ( which should not be the case with a phone ) because its `` digital '' . We tried rebooting the handset , and it did not work . She told me they would send me new ones if I paid $ 10 in shipping in handling . I asked her how I would know the same thing would n't happen to the new phones ( since it had happened to BOTH my handsets ) and she said it would n't . I then asked her , well what if it does , and she said I would n't have to pay again if happened again , but after 6 months I would have to pay . I asked her why six months and she said , oh that 's just an `` example '' .I then asked to speak to a supervisor , and she said you do n't need to speak to a supervisor . I asked 4 more times to speak to a supervisor , and she flat out refused . I asked for her name , and she hung up on me.The ironic part , is that if my click button wheel was working , I could have recorded the call and let Uniden hear it . But ahhh , it doesn't.At this point I do n't want to keep putting money into a lemon , ( paying the $ 10 every few months ) as I am convinced these phones putz out after a while . Not to mention , I am never buying a Uniden again because of the poor customer service.Do n't let the features and brand name fool you . Buyer Beware	-1
We have the Uniden cordless phone , and recently had some problems with the battery lasting less than a day on a charge . Consequently , I tried to call customer service , however Uniden only offers email customer service . I finally found a Texas number for them where one has to pay to call themThis is a far cry from Panasonic or Sony which both offer free , toll-free support . Apparently , Uniden is too cheap to offer a toll-free support number , and they want you to pay for the phone call . To add insult to injury , when I did finally call their pay support number , I had to wait twenty minutes for someone to answer . Simply pathetic . I would avoid this company . Apparently Uniden does not want to put any money towards customers , so why should customers pay for their phones ?	-1
Note : this is essentially the same review I wrote for the TRU8885-2 , because this phone has the same fatal flaw.Like the TRU8885-2 , I was excited to receive this phone , charge up the batteries , and try it out . My wife and I actually preferred the look of this model to the 8885 ; the base unit is a bit larger and the buttons are a bit larger and easier to read on both the base and handset . Unfortunately , after plugging this phone into my line ( Verizon phone service with DSL , DSL filter on the line ) , about 80 % of the time the phone would not get a dial tone . Eventually I determined that somehow the 9485 was dialing a `` 1 '' all by itself ( an 800 number without a preceding `` 1 '' went through OK , a local number would get error `` do not dial a 1 for this number '' ) . Dialing with the handset or base resulted in the same behavior.This is the same error as with the 8885-2s I returned the week before . @ $ # ^ % @ $ # ! So apparently there is a design flaw with multiple new Uniden models . Uniden CS was polite but unhelpful , so this phone ( just as the other Unidens ) had to be returned.I gave this unit two stars due to it 's design , and my understanding that this phone must be working on *some* phone lines out there . Perhaps your luck with this model will be better than mine.BTW , replaced this unit with a Panasonic KX-TG5672B , which works just fine on my phone line .	-1
I am disappointed with the phone and am returning it because : -- sound quality noticeably poor , it is tinny ( to me and folks I call ) -- zero consideration of voicemail . This phone has an answering machine ( if I could buy one that did n't have one , I would ) , but you have the ability to turn it off . On or off , if you do n't use it ( set the rings to 6 or more so that your voicemail kicks in first ) and someone leaves a message on voicemail , the phone has no way of indicating that there is a voicemail message for you to pick up . The user has to pick up the phone and listen for the stutter dial tone to detect whether there is a voicemail . Other phones I 've owned years older have the flexibility to deal with this quite common situation.The phone has good points , it has a solid feel to it , the volume of the speaker phone is good , and the basics , like lit keypads and easy to use menus are there.But , for me , the voice quality ( a key factor ) is lacking and the issue of voicemail notification combine to make the phone not one that I would recommend purchasing .	-1

To start , I have Windows 7 and did not have any problems loading the software as other users have mentioned . That being said , I thought the software was extremely confusing and outdated . I use Photoshop CS4 regularly and had trouble believing that this CD label software would be more difficult . It just does n't have enough options for me in terms of color matching , moving text and images around , or just overall design . I ended up just finding a Word template online and using that . It took much less time to do it that way.Also , the labels attached nicely to the discs using the attachment ( the first one did n't align properly , but I think that was my error ) however I put one in my 6 disc CD changer in my car and it got stuck . After 3 days of my CD player flashing `` error '' it finally popped back out and the label was not attached all the way . I am just thankful it did come out so I would n't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get my CD player fixed . I am glad this only cost $ 15 so I am not out more than that . Instead of investing in more labels , I will be saving up to get a printer that I can print directly onto CDs to avoid any further disasters . In the mean time , I will continue to label my CD 's with Sharpies ...	-1
Product is mislabeled . The product all works perfectly . I have no problems with that.When I purchased I thought I was getting 128 CD Labels . However it IS NOT 138 CD Labels.You Get : 30 CD Labels - 30 Multiple Use Labels - 30 Jewel Case Spines - 30 Mini CD Label.That is 120 total mix , not CD Labels . They do not even total 138 .	-1
For some reason Canon has not gotten with the program . Brother , HP and most of the other companies realize that a lot of people have home networks , and as a result people do not want an old-fashioned printer that needs an expensive print server to setup.It would be nice if Canon got this message as well since this printer is no good for networks when for the same price I can get an HP that does everything the MP830 does and can work wirelessly over a network . Also this Canon eats ink . If you plan on getting it you better get ready for frequent store runs .	-1
I was n't prepared for how enormous this multifunc printer is . I will use it thoroughly before deciding whether to return it because I ca n't fit it in my planned space . Also , a legal size tray is out of the question . I have a hewlette packard laser 5p that has lasted me for fifteen years without a problem . The price of inks is frightening so if I do keep it , I have to think twice about using it to RECEIVE faxes and I am definitely keeping my fifteen year old Hewlett Packard 5p black and white printer ( has never given me a moment of trouble ) .MINOR but firs problem : the light was lit for paper to feed from the feeder rather than the tray . The alert for the tray appears on both the printer itself and as a pop up on your computer screen . If you do n't have paper in the feeder , too bad for you , the printer will hum along and give printing in progress cartoons as if you did have paper . Is n't it standard on paper printers and on fax machines to be given notification of paper outage even if there is a feeder versus tray option ? I really want to keep this printer because it 's going to be a hassle sending this back and because the reviews are so good.Secondly , my first color print job 's colors is very disapppointing . I ca n't believe that the color is inferior to the Canon i950 that I stopped using when it got clogged with ink and I got tired of the experience of always having to change ink cartridges . I may have jumped out of the fire and into the frying pan with this . I like Canon cameras so I wanted a Canon printer . The reviews are really good so I would expect that this machine should live up to the reviews . Getting worried.Okay , now I 've printed photos taken with a Canon G5 . The colors off ( yellowy ) and the picture is n't clear . This is not photo quality which means I am better off not owning a printer and sending my digital photos out to print . This definitely seems to be inferior to the Canon i950 and I 'm feeling just a tidge bent out of the shape as I write this because this means that I have to send it back and I just ordered additional ink as I had big plans to print out masses of photos . Is Amazon going to give me a full refund less shipping on everything ? I ca n't believe that the reviews were so good and my experience was so far off . Now I ca n't edit the four stars I gave it.After 100 pages , the color ink tanks require replacement . That 's $ 45 to replace and that means that photos are 45 cents each for ink alone . Huh.p.s . I had ordered an additional full set of inks so I included the fresh tanks with the printer that I packed off to return them . Therefore , I am out the cost of those inks and out the cost of my paper . I did n't use the little packet of photo card stock packed with the printer . Also , I have no use for the off colored pages of photos that I printed out . I have to start from the beginning but it was worth it to lose the cost of the inks to know for sure that I should n't own this printer .	-1
My husband and I have been using this printer for about a year now , and at least twice a week we say , this is the worst printer we 've ever owned . The paper often goes through the printer at an angle , no matter what one does to keep it straight . This means that pictures and letters often print crooked on the page . In addition , the paper often crunches through the printing process creating an edge that is bent , scraped and deformed . If a person has normal sized arms , he/she ca n't reach the feed tray without getting up from the chair . Since the feed tray does n't hold much paper , this leads to lots of unexpected exercise . Last , after a few months this printer started printing two normal lines of text and then two lines of light text all the way through every page . All the cleaning and changing of cartridges have not changed this flaw . We do n't want to spend the money to get it fixed ( if it 's even possible ) because we plan to replace this printer as soon as we possibly can . Maybe we just got a lemon . But I wo n't buy Canon again for awhile .	-1
I have both the 81101 ( this model ) and the better alternativeLucky Line 71101 Key Ring.I highly recommend the 71101 model . it is easy to open and stays securely closed.The model 81101 is very cumbersome with the twisting motion required , especially when loaded up , if you can even make it that far in the process .	-1
I had been using Kodak film and paper for over 40 years , and now am truly saddened by what has happened to what was an American institution . I saw the end of film , evidently before Kodak did . But I still believed that their paper would be top quality as it has been for the 60 years ( yes , 60 ) that I used Kodak paper . I do n't know why , but in comparing Kodak to HP Premium Plus Photo Paper , HP gets 4.5 stars and Kodak 2 . With Kodak , I 've had some bleeding problems and , few though they may be , an 8x10 uses a lot of ink - expensive ink - and to toss a photo because of bleeding or fading or crinkling is just too expensive and disappointing for me.It 's not all about money , but it it 's certainly the major factor . Still , when used on an Epson or HP printer , Kodak paper just does n't live up to the claims of the company . While I have had to let others dry for a day ( to be safe ) so they wo n't stick to frames or other photos , Kodak seems to need even more time.I 've had some fading which just should not be . But perhaps the worst problem is slippage and ultimate crinkling or printing off-center.I have not used this on a Kodak printer . The only Kodak printer I purchased did not work , and I returned it and bought a Canon . Now that that has broken after 3 years , I 'll be looking at Canon and Epson , but not Kodak and not HP . Much as I like HP 's paper , their ink is even more expensive than others.My new life goal at this point is to have a printer break just as I 've used up all the ink that I have for it . Since I 'll have HP paper , THAT is the only thing I do n't have to worry about .	-1
Too light , with the Kodak name , you expect better . The paper curled so much it was difficult to feed into my printer . if you left some in the printer overnight forget it . It wo n't feed . HP is much better product	-1
While scanning 35mm film strips in the film holder , `` thumbnails '' are NOT produced according to specifications . The scanner just slices off the film strip at a fixed interval that does n't happen to jibe with my photos . I checked everything , reloaded all the software , followed instructions to the letter , and finally called Epson product support . I was on the phone on `` my dime '' for 20 minutes . All they could suggest was to use the full strip mode and crop the images on the film strip . That is unacceptable because it 's a real loss in productivity . They said it might be that my photos were dark or there was a dark area in the photo . My photos were not dark in general but you can find a dark area in ANY photo.A further disappointment was the graininess of all the scanned photos even when scanning at 2400 and 4800 dpi . I would have to edit all the photos to remove noise and graininess.I tried the Digital ICE and was further disappointed first because the scanner stops and has to `` warm up '' again in the middle of processing each photo . Further , the Digital ICE photos were very grainy as well.I bought this scanner to replace my Nikon CoolScan because that unit takes forever to scan slides and 35mm film stips . All the customer comments on this product were great but I am one that is disappointed and will be shipping the scanner back to Amazon in the morning .	-1
Bought two of them at the same time for use in seminars -- units ( both ) failed to work . Returned both to Amazon . Will try another brand -- do n't waste your $ .	-1
The old clich & eacute ; you get what you pay for is true in this case . I ordered one , did n't work ( laser pointer ) , returned to Amazon , got another one and it would n't work either ( advance nor backup ) the slides . Returned it and ordered the Logitech presenter .	-1
I hate this printer with a fiery passion . I fantasize about running it over with my car - that 's how much of a hassle it has been.The Good ( and the reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 ) :1 . Color copies are crisp and look good - especially with a higher quality paper.The Bad:1 . The scanner makes me insane . It is so slow I could send my document more efficiently via pony express . It also randomly does n't work some days - particularly after scanning multi-page documents.2 . HP customer 'support ' is so bad it 's like a comedy routine about outsourced customer support . If you need help , plan to devote a few hours on the phone to HP 'support ' , and plan to go through long checklists that are unrelated to your problem . The last 2 times I called with a question their solution was to unplug the unit and leave it unplugged for a few days and try again.3 . The fax is slow and sometimes unreliable.4 . Like others , I was annoyed that I needed to buy my own USB cable - and the first one I bought did n't work with this printer ( though it works with other things ) - I had to get another.5 . The set-up . I may not be a pro but I am hardly a tech novice - I have a home office and have used several different all-in-ones in the past . This is the first time that installing a printer caused me so much trouble ( including buying multiple USB cables and calling HP 'support ' twice ) .Also , and I ca n't count this as a negative since it is stated , be aware that this unit does not copy wirelessly unless you have an Ethernet connection/card.Bottom line : Hours upon hours of hassle and frustration make this unit not worth it at any price .	-1
After two weeks of waiting I was informed that I would not be getting this product.I think I got a refund . Not sure though .	-1
I have had this machine since june 2006 . This is a decent machine if you can get past its software.The good : - Built-in networking.- The print quality is good.- The cartridges do n't run out too quickly and are widely available.- The ADF is very convenient.- All the features are accessible over the network.- Works well under Win XPThe bad : - The software is extremely bloated . Count on at least a half hour to an hour per machine to install it for network use.- The speed is not anywhere near advertised . We are talking more like 30s for the first black & white copy to be complete in average mode , not 30ppm.- Some features are badly broken under Vista , even with HP 's latest Vista drivers from March 2007. a ) The OCR software produces garbage PDFs under Vista . b ) the card reader does n't work over the network , even after applying one of HP 's fixes- Tech support is terrible . I tried to escalate the vista problems , but spent hours with someone in India who was useless and just could n't do anything besides tell me to uninstall and reinstall the drivers ( thanks , that did n't work ... ) ) .- No duplex printing , scanning or copying . I need this for my next machine . But it wo n't be an HP due to the terrible problems with Vista and tech support .	-1
While the printer has worked moderately well , the cost of ink is outrageous . Making disposable printers and inflated ink cartridges is only bad for the business of America but it also leads to tremendous amounts of electronic waste . That is to say , HP has chosen a business model that benefits itself ( temporarily ) but harms the rest of society . Of course , HP 's main goal is to fight price transparency . Yet , this only goes so far .	-1
I bought this as a replacement for my old Photosmart P2350 printer , which was good , but did n't have a fax machine . The Office Jet 6310 does , and the price was right , so I got it.This is a straightforward multifunction ( 4-in-1 ) office machine . What 's good about a 4-in-1 is that it does 4 things in one ! The 6310 has a fax machine with built in 33.6kbps modem , a color scanner , copier , and printer . The fax machine has an auto document feeder , which is nice for sending multiple pages . Up front is a panel for the various functions ; scanning , faxing , and copying . There 's an alphanumeric pad for faxing , and a backlit LCD dot-matrix display . You can hook this printer up to a home network . There are slots for memory cards also . There 's an Ethernet cable port in back , so it 's network compatible . I have mine hooked up to my home wireless network through a router , and it works fine.HP says this will do 33 pages per minute black and white and 25 color . Obviously it 's an exaggeration , because it depends on the print quality . A fast draft print will come close , but for anything else , forget it . I 'd get good color prints in over a minute on the maximum DPI . It uses print cartridges quickly also . I burned through a color and a back and white in a couple months of light use , less than 200 pages . HP cartridges are expensive and rarely go on sale.This does print great photos , although not as good as a dedicated photo printer like the PhotoSmart series . The Canon Pixima 4-in-1 series machines do the best job , but were a lot more expensive . Black and white , text comes out clean and sharp , but not as sharp as a laser machine . The scans come out good , but expect to wait for them . Same with copies . Scanning and copying are both PAINFYULLY slow with the 6310 . Other machines do much better , and the higher end HP 4-in-1 's perform all these tasks quickly.Overall , this is a good machine for light use or occasional use . It would be best for someone who needs to send an occasional fax , scan , or copy something . It does everything I ask it to , and does it good enough.Pros : Low priceHP qualityreadily available ink cartridgesQuick printingGood print qualityNetwork readyMulti-card readerAuto document feederConsSlow print speedsPainfully slow scanning and copyingExpensive ink cartridgesPhoto printing could be betterCartridges do n't last long	-1
The cost for a pack of these pens seemed too good to be true . I had found that Uniball Signo had been the most reliable pen , right down to the last drop.BUT NOT THESE . Almost everyone skips . I 'm ready to chuck the whole box.Not recommended ! PS : label says red , but I got black pens which is what I ordered .	-1
Who has n't opened a looseleaf binder by the rings and not by the lever ? The mechanism should accommodate that , but because I tried to open this binder by the center ring , it is ruined , with a gap of more than an eighth of an inch which wo n't bend back despite all my efforts . It may still be useable if used to hold stiff cardboard reference materials , but thin sheet protectors need to be able to slide over all three rings.I am therefore disappointed with this binder .	-1
Excellent Printer TERRIBLE Software.The included editing software is barely usable . You can not cut and paste text from another application into your labels.Text will usually printout lower than what a shown in the editor . A job that looks perfect on your display using 'print preview ' will look different when actually printed . Be prepared for lots of wasted tape.I have the latest software from brother ( 3.2c ) , which only shows compatibility with older , obsolete operating systems.If you want to use the printer 'stand-alone ' you will probably be happy . The included editing software reminds me of Mac OS 6 or Windows 3.1	-1
I bought this labeler several years ago and had to replace it with another model due to the ridiculous waste of batteries . As many others have written , you can get only a few labels before the batteries are exhausted . That 's just a really poor design.I purchased a Brother rechargeable model that 's vastly superior .	-1
I like several of the features on this , but its waste of batteries makes it of very little use . Because it is programmed to keep the date and time current , it is never really `` off . '' I used it once a week for the first few weeks , but found that it needed new batteries every couple of weeks . Now , I have to take out the batteries each time I put it away . That 's rather annoying , but not as annoying as having to reset the date & time each time I power it up again , because it wo n't let you proceed with labeling until you enter date , time , language , etc . It gets used two to four times per YEAR now . Maybe if I ever find a power cord for it I would use it more , but the power cord will likely be as much as I paid for the labeler 5 years ago ( $ 28 ) . Plus , it will likely require resetting each time I plug it in , which would still be annoying . The main reason I had bought it was because I had tapes leftover from my older , broken model . When i went to use them , though , the tapes had dried out and could n't be used ! I should have returned when I had the chance . Prints well & has a few different print styles .	-1
I hate this photo printer . Even though I had another HP Photosmart Printer ( 8250 ) , I bought this one as part of a promotion for its flat-bed scanner capabilities . Since I needed a copier and since I liked my other Photosmart , HP Photosmart 8250 Printer ( Q3470A # ABA ) , it seemed perfect for my needs.The black ink runs out very quickly - and I do n't use the unit except for copying . At first I thought the ink was merely drying out , but it quickly became apparent that the cartridges , as expensive as they are , do n't contain enough ink for normal usage . If I used this as my regular printer , I 'd have tossed it out long ago.If you are printing photos , you must print everything on your memory card since there 's no way of selecting individual photos . Even worse , it does n't have a USB port , so you ca n't even put a single photo on a flash drive and print from that . It does have selections that allow you to choose borderless prints , different paper and print qualities , and full-size v. proof sheet printing . It accepts all memory card types - just not USB.The quality of printing is good , but for photos , I do n't think it 's as good as the single-purpose 8250 . The all-in-one categorization makes it seem as though it is a versatile machine , when in reality the compromises make this a frustrating machine for all jobs . Although it can do everything , it exacts certain costs for each - expensive ink costs and expensive photo paper costs ( because you have to print all photos ) .I 've given this printer two stars since it does perform as advertised . The problem , however , lies in the sacrifices you have to make to use it .	-1
I have a very bad lumbar region plus sciatica . I just can not know whether this helps per se as opposed to using TENs and opiates . It feels like a lumpy , slim pillow .	-1
Unlike other reviews here , for me the lapinator and mousepad did n't work so well . Used it with a Toshiba Satellite laptop and optical mouse . After about 2 hours , the lapinator was almost HOT to the touch , laptop fan did not run less , laptop itself did not feel cool to the touch . Had better luck with other coolant systems . Maybe Toshibas run hotter than other laptops , so it could be a matter of that particular laptop not being well-suited for the lapinator . I run my new HP Pavillion right on my desk 's surface , with no resulting overwarming of the laptop or the desk surface . Possibly , this particular cooling pad works optimally with only certain laptops .	-1
The height is spring-operated and adjusted by tightening or loosening a screw . Unfortunately , the adjustment does n't work very well and it always keeps inching higher -- hard on your neck if that is a problem for you.It rotates well enough , though .	-1
I do n't understand why we have to pay such high prices for printer ink . Someone somewhere with the knowledge of such things needs to start some sort of organized protest to this gouging . It is unacceptable to print 8 photos and have to pay for more way overpriced Ink . If it were not for landfill issues it is often cheaper to buy a new printer then buy ink for it .	-1
I own the XP-310 Epson printer , not this model . However , there is some corporate greed technology in the XP-310 that is most likely in all of their printers.I actually really liked my Epson printer until it came time to replace the ink cartridges . I always look at the replacement cartridge prices before I buy , and the Epson were cheap . However , I soon found out that the minds at Epson went to VERY great lengths to make sure you can use only genuine , way-over priced genuine Epson cartridges in their printer . The aftermarket cartridges won & # 8217 ; t be & # 8220 ; recognized & # 8221 ; by the printer , and even the empty refillable cartridges won & # 8217 ; t work either . Don & # 8217 ; t bother with the bottles of ink to refill your existing Epson cartridges , for that won & # 8217 ; t work either.I could have bought 4 black and 2 each of the other three colors for $ 14 for the aftermarket products . Instead , the cheapest I could find for the same 10 Epson cartridges cost over $ 80 . Actually they weren & # 8217 ; t the same , the aftermarket were the larger capacity ( model 200XL ) where the Epson cartridges at $ 80 were the smaller capacity ( model 200 ) .Maybe other or even all other printer makers do this same thing , as I don & # 8217 ; t buy printers often . In the mean time I will have my old Canon printer repaired and use the Epson only for scanning and copying .	-1
I do n't really use my printer that much so when I started having problems I went online to return it only to find out that AFTER 30 days - you ca n't . Parts that were supposed to be fit together at the factory or wherever were n't . So after doing 4 repairs and the last one was beyond me , I tried to return it- no such luck . So I went directly to Epson and bought it from them , same model , same supplies but no problem . Buyer Beware !	-1
I would not recommend this scale at all . It worked for a few months and then it just stopped responding to buttons when I pushed them . The detachable face plate feature is handy but it does n't really help things if the scale does n't work . Very frustrated and I would not buy another product from this manufacturer again .	-1
The user guide for this calculator is obviously either written for another model , or by a tech writer who has serious problems .

I owned my first HP 12C for at least 15 years . This new Chinese-made version lasted less than one year . The enter key no longer works making the calculator worthless . This calculator is very expensive if it becomes worthless in less than one year . I will have to buy another one because I love to use this calculator and find it difficult to use any other . Hopefully the shoddy construction is just a fluke .	-1
I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless . I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble ( have to press hard for it to register ) . No drops , no abuse . The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic . The keys feel hollow and light . The available functions are great . This is a classic calculator . But the functions are no good if the keys stop working ...	-1
Nothing like ordering a new pencil and getting one with a sticker on it thrown in a sizable box with some air packets , like it is some sort of second hand item or return ? Upon analyzing the pencil the first thing I noted was that where the clip mechanism locks into the barrel it is held by a plastic recess ... this metal clip being opened and closed a lot upon plastic material just does not bode well for the plastic parts . Upon taking the tip off and the grip there is plastic threads and plastic barrel underneath a metal `` skin '' . Pretty much a metal veneer of sorts all along this pencil . I would think metal on plastic threads would not tend to hold up for a long length of time . My conclusion is this pencil while looking quite nice on the exterior , the quality and durability of basically plastic guts just will not stand the test of time . I see Pentel selling lots of these due to the durability issues , sadly another company that has always made products I have used and liked over the years has stepped quality down a notch . The design of plastic plastic threading/click mechanism being used against metal just defies common sense to me . They should have went the step further and maybe charged a buck or two more for a far superior product .	-1
My boxes just came in , so I ca n't report on some of the issues experienced by others such as the sides coming unsnapped . But , seeing what I have seen , it seems entirely plausible . What I CAN say for certain is that the top is oversized , and there is nothing suspending the top above the file tabs . Crushed file tabs , guaranteed if you stack ANYTHING on top.This seems like a great concept , and with some tweaks , ( and added expense ) , they would really be on to something .	-1
What drew me to this type of tray was that the trays moved so it was easy to retrieve whatever was in the tray . The reality of the matter is the trays are n't very stable and you cant put much in them . And the slide backwards as well . i lost a lot of papers behind my desk for that very reason . The stand does n't like to stay put either . Its not very sturdy and it slides very easily . Another way I lost a lot of papers . There are enlough trays in the world to skip over this one and find something better made .	-1
I bought this toner in a 'package ' deal with my fax ... problem is that I was ripped off by over $ 8.00 shipping that was separate from the free shipping I got for my fax . I 'm not happy about this and I recommend NOT buying the toner and fax together ... they 'll rip you off with the shipping cost ... over $ 8.00 to ship a toner that weighs a few ounces , Amazon should be ashamed and not let this happen !	-1
Had it for about 1month now , so far so good , everything detailed is accurate , I wish it 's a little more heavy duty so it sits tigher on the desk . That 's a personal preference though I 'm sure if it 's dropped it 'll do less harm.Update : after 1-2month it broke , with probably 2 uses a week . It 's past my return period so it 's just a waste of money now .	-1
I have purchased quite a bit of bubble wrap on Amazon , and I must say this is the worst I have ever tried ! Not only did it ship in a flimsy plastic bag , which had several holes in , but the bubble wrap itself is very flimsy . The perforations are extremely hard to find , the the overall quality is just really cheep . I would not by this again !	-1
I ordered these with the intent they would be a good size for mailing small ointment tubes or small vitamin jars for my online OTC sales . Unfortunately these have no give to them so there 's no way I could squash something in here without the risk that it will tear throughout the mailing process . These are very much a cheap material , so a soaking rain could destroy whatever product you are sending to your customer . I do n't recommend this product .	-1

This stapler gave me about 2 months of good use and then it started to malfunction badly . I tried everything and finally threw it in the garbage after 2 months . Rediculous	-1

This machine is easy to use and the printing/copying is superior , but the ink evaporates . When I first bought it , I was using it all the time . It seemed like I was going through more ink that my previous Canon copier , but I was doing a lot of printing . What bothered me is that I was doing all black printing and the color cartridges were running out . Now I only print or copy a couple of sheets a month and I go through two to three sets of cartridges a year , including the color cartridges which I NEVER use . I LOVED my previous Canon copier , but I hate this one . I 'm currently in the process of looking for a new 4 in 1 machine . I was going to give away or donate this one , but I do n't want to stick anyone with this piece of junk , so I 'm going to recycle it .	-1
Short and simple . This product just does n't work . No beyond that . After properly inserting . Batteries and confirming that the shaving collector was snapped securely into place I eagerly put in my first pencil and waited . Sadly nothing happen . I reinserted the batteries and got ready to sharpen pencils to my hearts content . But even though the shaving blade spun nothing happen to the pencil.Long story short . Pencil sharpened did n't work ended up sharpening 72 pencils nona old wall mount pencil sharper that 's older then I am . Proof positive that you get what you pay for and that low tech works out in a pinch..	-1
Ok here 's the deal ... This worked with the first set of batteries , but the subsequent purchases proved to be futile since , no matter which battery I purchased , nothing worked.The sharpener was less than $ 10 . The batteries have cost me almost $ 18 , and , as I mentioned , it only worked with the first set , about 5 days , and now no longer works.They sent me a second , which worked not at all ( it was missing the metal lead ) .It cost me nothing to get it replaced . but ... Buy electric , that is what I finally did and it works great.As for X-acto , buy their products . They stand behind them and have GREAT costumer service.Dianne Schuch Lindsey dlschuch at Salon.com ( Open Salon )	-1
I bought this product for my grandchildren , as they use a lot of pencils at home doing school work and their many arts and crafts projects . I was very disappointed by the performance of this sharpener . It did not work well at all out of the box . When it did run , it did not sharpen the pencils , it just ground them up , no matter what kind of pencil it was . After two days and wasting an entire package of 20 pencils , I ultimately sent it back . I then ordered a manual crank sharpener that suctions to the table and it works great . And it was far less expensive .	-1
I have used foil tape for various craft projects over the years- I have never seen such a thin foil tape and the price was the same as the tape I usually buy that is 4 times thicker and 3 times bigger of a roll ! I use this now to tape closed my do it yourself faraday metal boxes that I have my electric equipment in -should there be a CME , huge solar flare OR EMP , If your batteries and electronics are n't in a faraday box sealed with foil tape- they 're not going to work when you need them the most . Look up Carrington event- if you do n't know what I 'm talking about .	-1
This scanner is okay as far as the quality of images goes ; nothing fabulous , but not bad for the price , either . However , the software that comes with the scanner is absolutely terrible . ( I am using the software for Mac OS X , so maybe it 's different for Windows users . ) Some of the many glaring flaws : - There is an arbitrary limit of 20 characters for filenames when saving a scan . This might not seem like a big deal , but 20 characters is often not enough for a descriptive filename of any kind , especially when scanning multiple versions of a photo , for example , with different scan settings.- There is no preview mode , or any way to select a region of an image to scan . The user can only choose from a pre-set paper size , or type a custom paper size . Neither option lets you select something in the middle of the page , for example.- Application windows are filled with poorly-designed buttons of various sizes , strewn every which way , and with cryptic names . For example , in one window that comes up when the user chooses the `` confirm scanned image '' option , there is a button labeled `` forward . '' What does this mean ? Well , the button does the same thing you would expect from an `` OK '' or `` continue '' button.- When scanning , the status window ( showing the progress of the scan ) always stays on top of all other application windows . It ca n't be minimized , and does n't move to the background with the rest of the program 's windows when another application or window is selected . It can be moved , but the next time it pops up , it will be right in the middle of the screen again . This means that , when scanning multiple pages , it 's impossible to use the computer for anything else , because the scan progress window will keep popping up every 10 seconds and getting in the way of whatever else you are trying to view/type.- Unlike many other scanner models , this one has no ruler markings on the scanner itself . So if you need to know the dimensions of the item you are scanning -- to set a custom paper size in the scanning software , for example -- you 'll have to have a ruler handy.Bottom line : the terrible software interface makes this scanner almost unusable for me . ( The included PhotoStudio software is no better . ) It is unnecessarily complex , and some screens seem like they were translated from Japanese by someone not too familiar with English . The scanning software supplied for OS X looks and feels like a 1990s-era Mac Classic application.Incredibly , incredibly bad software . I wish I could post screenshots of some of the windows , so you 'd see what I mean.UPDATE : Some minor flaws with Leopard have surfaced . The software often fails to scan , popping up an error message `` failed to load driver . '' It usually goes away after several re-tries . Just more annoying behavior ...	-1
Quality of this mailing bag needs to be improved . Bag sides rip easily when inserting shipment into the bag.Also , after sealing the top item/s can be easily tampered with and removed . I had several customers never receive their products.My remedy is to seal both sides with packing tape , but this is adding dollars to my shipping costs.Would not purchase again .	-1
When I did a search prior to purchasing , I indicated , `` padded mailing bags '' . These came up . Guess I did n't read the fine print . No padding . Disappointed . Just thought I would let anyone know in case they expected padding .	-1
This printer produces decent quality copies and prints . My complaint and why it only got 1 star from me is the amount of ink this sucker drinks . It is the thirstiest printer I have ever owned . And , for some reason it uses the color cartridges even when printing in black . Another thing I hate about it is you ca n't print if one of the cartridges , it has 4 by the way , is out even if you are n't using that color . I 'm out of cyan right now and I can not print a document in black . I am going to be looking for a replacement printer soon as I will save money in the long run on ink .	-1
After almost 3 years with my previous favorite , The Epson Stylus Photo RX620 ( see my Amazon review ) , it finally took a trip south . I must say the RX620 was the best AIO I had ever had or seen , but it was time to move on . As I was n't printing too many photos anymore , I decided to downgrade from the RX to the CX model and save a few $ $ . I loved the look of the CX6000 and the price was good to match . Now I know you usually only get what you pay for , but Epson has never really followed that theory and I have been pleasantly surprised in the past . Well , not this time . Everything installed wonderfully and I was up and printing within minutes , but herein lies the problem . The prints on plain paper were fine but the photos were banded and sloppy . And just like everyone else said , it appears to eat through , at least , the first set of ink cartridges . I printed 1 8x10 photo on regular paper , 2 pages of text and 2 4x6 prints and the ink went down almost a 1/4 . After doing a head cleaning to try and stop the banding , the ink went down past 1/4 and the banding got worse . That was enough for me . It was boxed right back up and exhanged for the Canon MP600 which is the epitome of amazing , and for only $ 40 more ! Again , I do ( well ... did ) LOVE Epson , but it appears their quality control has taken a turn for the worst . I gave it 2 stars due to a quick and painless setup .	-1
Epson continues to rip people off in droves , and there is yet to be a congressional hearing.They have to have some senator and house representatives deep in their pockets . We onlypurchased two of these ( thank God ) - because they drank ink worse than a broken waterpipe . We have owned almost every Epson model and every one has had issues . Thegarbage they place on the market only to bait potential customers is appalling . We havewritten these thieves many times ( very politely and professionally ) including emails , phone calls , and letters -- they have never answered any of our questions . Our officeshave about 18 Epson models - including this one - and they are nothing but TROUBLE.Epson has to be one of most corrupt , greedy , and just plain evil companies on the Earth.Daniel J. Tyler ( The WJGroup )	-1
Unbelievable ! Ordered this a week ago . Inserted the cartridges . Used it to print 10 flyers , and the INK IS EXPENDED ( ? ) . Epson69 is for use with heavy print requirements . I have purchased this from Epson in the past and had no need to replace cartridges for months after inserting into the printer . NEVER have I purchased cartridges only to have the computer tell me they need replacing after ONE WEEK .	-1
This is probably a quality ink but considering its short life and the less than quality Epson printer it is designed for , I ca n't recommend it . Save your money and buy a Canon . I know that most ink jet ink cartridges do n't last long but these cartridges seemed to have a VERY short life .	-1
I did n't use my Epson printer much . So once the cartridges were opened and inserted into the printer , the ink dried up before I 'd printed many pages . I decided to get rid of that printer .	-1
This item does not hold anything , trying to go down a flight of steps whatever is on it will slide off.I should have purchased bungee cords as well to maybe get this to work bettr.gave this item to my sister	-1
I think this little cart would be great for someone that does n't need to strap anything down . Like a short haul maybe from room to room . But I bought it to carry a large tacklebox , a cooler , and a bait bucket out onto a 800 ft pier . NOT GOOD . The base is flat , so if or when you try to strap things down with a bungie cord the little plastic hooks make the cart wobbly , not sitting flat . The only way to use this cart successfully is like you see in the pic , flat items NOT strapped to the bottom plate , otherwise you in for trouble.Anyways , I sent it back . Got a full refund , no questions asked . Hope this review helps some other fisherman .	-1
Having used these highlighters for a couple months now , I have to change my review from its previous four-star rating down to two stars . For starters , although Sharpie advertises these as no smear , they DEFINITELY smear . I have an inkjet printer , and even two or three weeks after printing these highlighters will smear the printed ink , resulting in muddied colors that are n't bright and definitely do n't stand out.Secondly , I have to go back on what I initially wrote -- the colors are actually very dark . The more I use these , the less satisfied I am with the colors . I find only yellow , pink , and orange to be bright enough but the yellow chisel tip is unfortunately now black because of the printer ink and now when I use it , the color is more of a yellow-gray . For the other colors , you can absolutely still see the text underneath but I just do n't find the colors vibrant enough. -- -- -- -- -- -OLD REVIEW ( 9/6/10 ) Unlike other reviewers who thought that the colors of the dark blue and magenta were too dark to read the text underneath , I found the highlighters to be bright and work great . I have purchased purple Sharpie highlighters in the past which were VERY dark and nearly impossible to read the text , so these are great.My only problem with them is that they 're very long , about an inch longer than the average pen/Sharpie highlighter . I wish they were a little more standard-sized , as they are a tight squeeze in my pencil case .	-1
We did n't like these sharpies . The colors were ok , it needs a true purple instead of a pink and a magenta . The tips were uncomfortable to color or write with . We did , however , like that they are retractable . We tried them for a bit then gave them to the receptionist at school who was very happy to get them .	-1
The design of these highlighters leaves something to be desired . Long and bulky , the barrel of the marker resembles ( and feels in the hand ) like one of those plastic tubes that cigars come in . There is no grip and that makes using these pens uncomfortable when trying to highlight with the small nib.Though filled with `` Smear Guard '' ink , I still found that they still can smear ( but not terribly ) over a variety of different kinds of pens I tried . ( Gel , ballpoint , fountain pen ink ... ) It was worse if you went back and forth over the same area of writing - which you may have to do because the marker nibs are so thin.On thin paper , these highlighters bleed through . Some of the darker colors included in the set like the red , dark blue & magenta are too dark for use as a highlighter , but could be used for annotations.I did not find any difficulty or smearing when highlighting a sheet of paper printed with ink-jet inks , though i did not try on a freshly printed page.As I am a writer that frequently uses a fountain pen , I 'd love to find something that I can regularly use with water based fountain pen inks . I had hopes for these , but I guess I will have to revert to using dry crayon type highlighters .	-1
My wife owns just about every Sharpies product ever made so I jumped at the chance to try these accent markers . Unfortunately , one of the features that these markers are supposed to have is smudge free on any ink surface . I have a HP Photosmart inkjet printer and my wife got tons of streaking as well as absoprtion using these accent markers . She had printed some of her school lessons about 2 hours before using the Sharpie 's on them but the ink still smudged across the paper and some of the ink absorbed into the Sharpie.. Other documents worked fine but beware if you use an inkjet printer !	-1
I thought the retractable click was a cool idea , but unfortunately you have to wait forever for these to dry or they smear . And to make matters worse , the color does not stay bright and vivid . Things I had highlighted at the beginning of the semester were significantly faded by the end of the semester . I would not suggest anyone buy these .	-1
The tape I received had only one side.I was disappointed and returned it which Amazon credited money back to my account.Amazon is great for backing the products sold on their site.I will try Home Depot next .	-1
Terrible ! Ordered on Aug 7th and still have not received . Have a feeling Amazon is selling product that they do not have . Make sure yourpurchase is in stock . Amazon 's prices are great , but one can sell product they do not have for any price !	-1
This cartridge was either defective or a counterfit . I suspect counterfit as packaging and lable while it said epson , was different from actual epson parts . The printer would not recognize it at all . Took it out and replaced it with a known `` Epson Genuine Cartridge '' and printer works fine . Amazon , to thier credit , accepted the return and gave a refund .	-1
One might go so far as to wonder whether the representations made on this product page constitute outright fraud . The product I received was NOT as it is shown on this page . I did not receive Epson brand cartridges in the box , unopened , as shown.What I received were six cartridges , wrapped three to a package . So each cartridge was not individually wrapped , as is the case with cartridges ordered from Epson directly . Once the package is opened to be able to use one cartridge , the other two must sit opened , with only the tape on the ink port to protect against drying out . The six included a black cartridge , which the enclosed note said was a `` freebie '' because , while the company assured me these are original Epson cartridges , to `` reduce packaging '' , they were being sent wrapped as they were.I had misgivings , but the cartridges DID have the Epson logo on them , looked like the others I 've been accustomed to , so I put them in my cartridge drawer to use as needed.The first cartridges I 've used seemed to go much faster than normal , without a corresponding increase in my customary printing load . Then , today , I went to replace two additional cartridges ... certain colors do n't seem to get used as much , so replacement rates vary ( one of the reasons I love having an inkjet that allows for colors to be replaced individually , rather than as an integrated unit is that you always end up wasting ink on the multi-color single cartridge types ) . I used two of the cartridges that had been sitting , unwrapped , in the drawer , because I had already used one of the cartridges in the three-pack . What a nightmare ... the ink did n't flow , wasted paper , seven head cleanings ... I FINALLY got ink flowing , but I 'm now left with black ink flecks all along the paper . I do n't have this problem with inks I order directly from Epson or that I receive in the original equipment packaging.I really have to wonder what the deal is with these cartridges ... are they refilled , remanufactured ink cartridges and simply not identified as such ? Regardless of the answer , I WO N'T be ordering these again.NOT RECOMMENDED	-1
These `` Epson '' Ink Cartridges were rejected by 2 of our Epson Artisan 50 printers . As A Matter offact - The printers have not accepted any new `` Genuine '' Epson cartridges since July 2010 and aregathering dust.Daniel James Tyler	-1
I am a great fan of Canon products generally , but the the printer that requires this cartridge as a refill , well , it uses up the ink oddly fast . With my NEC laser printer , one $ 100 cartridge will last me 3 years . With this Canon printer , one $ 20 cartdridge lasts one month most . Do the math .	-1
the pens are used they also did not arrive when they were supposed to they came two days after they were supposed to be here and they sent it u.p.s to columbus you are in illinois i am in newcomerstown ohio why not just send it u.p.s to me then when they sent it to the post office it did n't update at all until it was about to be delivered the picture and what i got do n't really look the same but then again it was n't a great picture did n't even show an individual pen so you could see what you were getting the whole thing was a big mess an im glad it over i will never buy anything from tnt deals again not a good experience	-1
After using laminating pouches for years , I would n't consider myself an expert on the item , but I am expert on what suits my needs and what is acceptable to me . These pouches did not work as well as expected , in fact they were a huge disappointment . Plagued with air bubbles and `` foggy '' patches , the finished projects were not usable ( and definitely not sellable , for those who use their laminaters for craft projects ) . I generally use Scotch and Universal pouches and these Fellowes pouches were far inferior , actually ruining some of the laminated photos and pages . I would never purchase this item after seeing such poor results .	-1
This is the first time I 've had a stapler for a large number of pages . It was a pleasure to use . Then it simply fell apart . I have to reassemble this to get it to work each time . I will throw it away when I get a new stapler . Ca n't recommend it .	-1
Like another reviewer , I too must have received a defective batch as the tape simply would not stick . Every single roll was entirely worthless . It all ended up in the garbage .	-1
This tape is obviously made for commercial and industrial packaging , yet the dispenser is so small and cheaply made as to be useless.Take a pass on this one .	-1
I usually love 3M products , but this is just junk . What is odd , is I have used this product before and liked it.However , this time , the tape does not stick , well , except to itself . That is not all ... the cutter does n't cut ! Is this some kind of joke ? All I can think is either this was a defective batch , or the quality has certainly fallen ... which would be very sad indeed .	-1
I got sick and tired of trying to find the end piece of our large rolls of Scotch Packing Tape , and thought that these would solve the problem . Not only does the tape adhere to itself , but the cutter does n't cut , and the `` dispenser '' does a lousy job of dispensing . Once I pull out the tape , it does seem to stick to the boxes I 'm sealing , but it 's truly a pain .	-1
I use at least a roll of packing tape a week , so I am pretty good at using tape dispensers , this product has one major flaw , the very sharp cutting edge is not recessed , so there is nothing to protect your hands or fingers from being cut.I still have a pretty sore finger from my first attempt at using this product , so the experience is quite fresh in my mind . I actually cut my finger trying to remove the piece of cardboard so I could actually use the tape for the first time.There is no caution statement on either the dispenser or the package about very sharp edges , so buyer be warned , and do not let children near this dispenser.The tape itself is great , and the size is good for taking with you to the Post Office if you need to finish packing a box there , but I strongly suggest finding a container to put this tape dispenser in so you do not cut yourself trying to fish it out of your purse or bag.If you frequently use tape , I would recommend a different dispenser : While still sharp , the cutting edge is slightly recessed which will protect your hands and fingers . It is also easy to reload with replacement rolls of tape and out of the many different tape dispensers I have tried , it performs the best.Scotch Packaging Tape Hand Dispenser DP300-RD	-1
I do n't know what is going on with this packaging tape , but it is n't sticky ! I have gone through two rolls wrapping just a few packages because the tape does n't stick to anything except itself . I do n't know what the problem here is , but definitely DO NOT buy this product . I thought it was a fluke , but this is the second time this has happened to me ordering this product !	-1
This packing tape will stick to nothing . Often when tape refuses to stick to the box , one can wrap it around to meet itself because it will stick to itself . This wo n't . I do n't know what has happened to 3 M Company , but I will never again buy their packing tape .	-1
I use Scotch products a lot , especially the tape . I have been buying the larger rolls without the 'holder ' that comes with each one of these rolls . I really dislike that little holder ! When I ordered this package I was thinking of convenience - I would n't have to be holding a box cutter all the time to cut the tape . Well , after applying 2 band-aids to my fingers upon completion of two rolls , I wo n't mind a bit ! I was constantly getting my fingers cut by the serrated edge on the holder as I cut the tape . Not only that , but the tape would twist as I was taping the sides of a carton.And , as another reviewer said , there is not much tape on each roll so the holder is just a waste of product/plastic.As far as the sticking capability , I did notice I would have to make sure to run my hand over the tape once it was on the box . I normally do that with any tape I use , but this tape actually 'stood up ' from the box in areas . Odd . It seemed fine once I pressed it all down . But to make sure , I used extra tape around the top and bottom of the box which is not cost effective and I actually used 1 complete roll for 1 large box.No , this product is not for me . I will continue to buy Scotch tape in the larger size without the holder .	-1
We had to return due to the colors being too much . Yeah..thought that was the point only to find out the boss said no.Nothing wrong with them . I personally would have been happy with them .	-1

I tried to find a cheaper replacement for my old worn out Epson 3800 but this proved to be a really crappy printer compared to the Epson . I had another Canon photo printer years ago and the same problems happened back then that are still happening with this new one . The ink color is good for about 20 days then they seriously start to degrade with colors bleeding on the paper making your image seem blurry and inky also they turn really really yellow and fade . I use only OEM Canon inks and Premier Premium Luster paper . I sell my work and like last time I used Canon this will cost be a lot of money in replaced photos . NOT HAPPY ! I am presently trying to return it but I no longer have the box . I just ordered a new Epson 3880 for over 1200.00 , a lot more money but at least it had a 250.00 rebate and I know my images will not fade . I have images I printed on my Epson 3800 and 2200 that are still perfect after 6 years . There is NO COMPARISON between Canon and Epson 's lasting image quality , Epson is by far the best . This will be my very last Canon Photo printer however , I still like their document printers just fine . If you sell your stuff by an Epson , period .	-1
I bought this printer to use at home . In this setting , people usually have only one phone line . I would expect that it will switch to fax if the the incoming call is a fax and let the answering machine receive it if it is a voice call . I tried many differnt values for DETECT TIME and CHECK TIME for the ANS mode . None of them works . I found from the web that this is a known problem . If you buy this printer expecting to use in this setting , I would strongly suggest you find other printers . I just can not believe that this printer fails this basic function existing in almost all fax machines.Comment after one week : I have tried many values for CHECK TIME and DETECT TIME for ANS mode . I found that CHECK TIME=20 secs and DETECT TIME=40 secs work for me . It works for four ring case that answering machine does n't have messages and two ring case that answering machine has messages . The fax will only pick up after the outgoing message is over . So you will have fax beeps in your answering machine . Canon support gave me 30 secs for both values . But it works for the fax from Canon not for the fax from other places I tried . These two numbers have relationship with the time the phone rings to the time outgoing message is over . For me , it is 23 seconds for the four ring case , I figure that 20 is good compromise between the 2 ring and four ring cases . Good luck .	-1
I 'm not an artist . In fact , I have no artistic ability at all . Even my stick people do n't look good , but I do like to color , and sometimes use colored pencils to do so . I do n't like these pencils . I do n't like the way their hexagonal shape feels in my fingers . I have some pencils that are round . I like the way they feel.As pencils , these start out well . There 's a nice array of colors , and the color is vibrant . The lead is soft and goes on the paper quickly and easily , but that softness is also their downfall . When I press down to get a darker shade , little bits are left behind . When I brush them off , they leave little streaks of color on the paper , and some color on my fingers . The only way to get them off is to shake the paper over a wastebasket.As paints , they did n't do well at all . First , I colored randomly and went over it with a wet paintbrush . The water sort of blended each color so the pencil marks were mostly gone , but it also lifted the lighter colors . It does n't look like a watercolor , especially with some of the color gone . Then I wet the paper and colored . Water weakens paper and the pencils made marks in the paper . When it dries , the paper is grooved . I can imagine that a `` little toddler '' would go right through the paper . Then I wet the tip of the pencil . That worked better than wetting the paper , but the water still weakened the paper , and the paper ended up being groovy . Unfortunately , in this case , not a good thing . Plus , it ended up just looking like colored pencil , so why bother with the water.After giving these a try , my advice is that if you want your artwork to look like a watercolor , go buy some watercolors . It would be a lot easier than fussing with these .	-1
We have had this shredder for 3.5 years and during that time it worked well , but at times a bit noisily . Yesterday I went to give it a single sheet of paper and it failed catastrophically . It senses the paper , the motor runs , but the shredding mechanism does not move ... It seems a gear has stripped or broken . I could live with a failure at that age , IF there were any way to get it repaired , but there is n't ! ! ! Fellowes considers these $ 200+ `` personal shredders '' as disposable , they do not sell spares and they do not repair them . The best you can expect is an offer to sell you a remanufactured shredder with no warranty whatsoever.I suspect that I will not buy the remanufactured model that may be offered and will buy a competitor 's unit as a replacement , whose I do n't know yet .	-1
Upon first starting the unit I decided to laminate a couple of Obituaries . The first one came out a little wavy ; however , after reading the manual it was suggested that if the article was smaller than the pouch that I use the carrier . There was NO carrier provided in the box . The second obituary almost jammed in the laminator . Fortunately I was able to guide it throughj . The instructions were very vague . I have owned other Fellows office appliances in the past and was not impressed with performance . I will contact the compant to see if they have a carrier to use with it or perhaps once is provided when you buyt a full pack of the laminates .	-1
This would be an okay printer stand if it used different screws because tightening Phillips head screws going into wood in tight corners with a screwdriver is as close to 'mission impossible ' as they come . I 've assembled dozens if not hundreds of things in my 'consumer ' career because the price we pay for affordability is often inconvenience but this one should top the list of frustration.In the end , we got a printer stand that appears to be holding itself together , barely , because some of the screws could not be tighten all the way no matter how hard we tried . I believe that there 's some special tool that takes care of screws in tight corners but we do n't have it and I was n't about to buy or borrow one for this project.So , what you get is very much what you see . It should hold a printer and some supplies but you ca n't really place too much weight on the paper-thin sheet-metal shelf or it buckles as it did when I touched it with my hand . It 's 2 stars because , knowing what I know now , I would not buy this stand .	-1
And some of the pieces arrived bent . It says you need two people to assemble it and you do . While , while holding one of the sides up , I reached to pick up another screw and I let it the side piece tilt to the side a bit and part of the top veneer broke off around the screw hole . So it 's not very well made . Too , A quality company will provide better instructions and this one showed ONE diagram for assembling the main components and the rest of the diagrams were for adding the shelves and casters . There are really no written instructions at all . I can not recommend it .	-1
Made with cheap materials and comes in MANY , MANY pieces to put together . Nothing seems to fit square and when it is together I noticed that the shelf actually bows from just one ream of paper on it and the top , where I put my Konica magicolor 2500 printer , seems to also bow down the top from the weight of the printer . So pretty much worthless.Do not buy this stand ... ..I 'm going to either trash it or let it be in a corner for little trinkets that do n't weigh hardly anything . What a waste of time and effort putting it together .	-1
The instructions are horrible . If I could give stars for that , it would be negative 10 . I 've put a bakers rack together with many more parts and found it so much easier because all the parts were labeled and every step was laid out . This is ONE PAGE and I had to make a copy of the front page so I did n't have to flip back and forth trying to figure out what went where.The casters did not snap in , and one caster had blue gunk in it that I ended up getting all over the place . I simply ended up putting them in and since I wo n't be rolling it around often ( and I received this in exchange for review ) it 's not too much of a big deal . However , had I paid for this I think I would have sent it back.As for the unit itself - the top is thick and sturdy and the sides are also quite sturdy . I appreciate the folder holder that slips on the side easily . Even with horrible directions and realizing I had to unscrew a few parts to screw them back again ( which I noticed another reviewer had the same problem ! ) - it took me about an hour . I do n't put things together too often , so someone who has a knack for assembly or more experience might have a better experience . There was a point where I was so confused and frustrated I thought I was missing a part and almost trashed the whole thing - if you get to that point , just step back , take a few breaths , or a shot of bourbon ( or both ) and realize it 's NOT YOU , it 's the them , and then tackle it again ! Looking back on my experience , I would NOT pay the 119.00 it 's currently going for .	-1
Let 's get this said first -- we all hate those illustrated directions that come with Chinese put-it-together furniture . You know , the ones with little to no text , cryptic graphics that only a child could love , no photos and the infamous parts list of A to Z . That 's exactly what you get with Safco 's Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand.Well , almost . There is one significant difference with this product -- and it 's a big deal . Other to-be-assembled furniture ( including some of Safco 's own products ) have lettered stickers on the various parts so that you can match them up with the part letters on the drawings . You get no such help from Safco on their Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand . You are left to figure out what each item is by studying the less than clear instruction sheet drawings.Okay , some things are obvious . There is only one Leg Frame ( part B ) and it looks different from anything else . However , try to tell the Adjustable Shelf ( part G ) from the Bottom Panel ( part F ) and you have your work cut out for you . ( Here 's a hint . There is a subtle difference and the instructions do attempt to illustrate this . G has a double flange on the front , F does not . So look carefully . ) This furniture is black on black on black . ( The panels are black , the shelves are black and -- wait for it -- the screws are black . ) If you have n't yet had the fun of looking inside a totally black stand to try and determine if the black screws are tight or not , you are in for a frustrating adventure . You may need to borrow a 5,000 watt movie flood lamp to have enough light to see if you tightened everything down.Speaking of the screws , they are all the same . It does n't matter if you are screwing into the pressboard top or the aluminum legs , you use exactly the same type screw . And those screws do n't seem to want to penetrate the press board . They bind long before they are fully meshed . Now , this is a total mystery . There is nothing as easy to punch a hole through then pressboard , yet these screws do n't seem up to the task . They do better into the aluminum legs , although on my stand one of the legs had a screw hole that was n't tapped properly and the screw resisted being tightened down into that hole.While we are speaking of the screws , they come in a plastic bag inside of the parts box . My unit had a punctured plastic bag , so instead of being nicely contained they were scattered all about inside of the parts box . That should not have been the case.The last surprise was the casters . Keep in mind that you are assembling the unit upside down at first and then on its side when installing the casters . The casters do not lock into the caster sockets . They just slide into the hole . In fact , the so-called caster socket is nothing more than a hole drilled into a piece of plastic that is shoved into the legs . Once you install the casters and begin to tilt the unit right side up , the casters fall out . There is nothing to hold them in place other than good old gravity . That made for several frustrating moments at the end of the installation . If Safeco had thought to have the casters lock into the caster sockets ( like it does on other manufacturer 's furniture , ) tilting the unit up would have been a non-issue . Instead I wound up installing the casters by laying on the floor with the unit right side up and lifting one leg at a time.I really debated whether to give the Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand two stars or three stars . In terms of usability as a printer or scanner stand once it 's completed , it 's probably a three star rating . However , the poor instructions and the thoughtless way that some of the parts go together ( especially those caster wheels ) really deserves a one star rating . So , in the end , I decided that two stars is probably the fairest rating I can offer Safeco on this Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand .	-1
Make sure you have a small ratcheting screwdriver or you will never be able to assemble this thing . The instructions are terrible , the pieces are not clearly marked , and the screws are located in very tight corners . If you ever get it assembled , you 'll have decent stand . But it 's nothing special . The average usefulness combined with the awful assembly makes it one I would avoid .	-1
When buying this , make sure these are OEM and new products and not the outdated and remanufactured type or you will be sending them back like I did .	-1
What is one to say about name-brand ink cartridges ! They are all over priced and seem to work no better than cheaper clones .	-1
Without reading my whole review , here is the key : when you buy ink directly from Amazon , you can expect to receive exactly what you ordered . If , on the other hand , your order is sold by somewhere/someone else but `` fulfilled by Amazon ) , buyer beware . These seem to result in a lot of expired ink being sold.I ordered a 2 pack of HP ink ( # 56 and # 57 ) . The product page shows a stock photo of an HP 56/57 combo pack.As soon I opened the brown Amazon box , I knew there was a problem . The cartridges were not in their HP box as pictured , but in their sealed HP foil packets . I have run into this before with sellers on Amazon . Some sellers claim they discard the box to reduce shipping weight.What they really mean is `` I discard the box to hide the expired date on the box . `` I can see from the coding on the foil package and the expiration date on the 2 cartridges I purchased show that they expired 7 1/2 YEARS AGO , in September and October of 2005 , respectively ! This is not the first time I have run into this issue with HP ink fulfilled through Amazon.When you but these ink products and get fresh ink , they are great , but when it is old , HP does n't warranty it for performance or leaks , and many printers reject it altogether as they have firmware which reads the cartridge and sees it is old .	-1
As with all ink , way too costly for way too little ink . If not for the space in landfills I would rather buy a new printer for less then the cost to buy new ink .	-1
Even at Amazon 's lower price , this ink costs $ 7,480.00 per gallon . How can anyone have anything positive to say about such robbery ? This is not Amazon 's fault ; in fact , Amazon offers this ink at the lowest price I have found . I guess it could be worse as some Epson inks price out to over $ 20,000.00 per gallon.Thanks Amazon for doing what you can to help .	-1
The listing I see here is FIVE pens each a different color . Granted the written description says a green pen BUT it is very easy when in a hurry to think this is a listing for FIVE pens and order . I own all these pens and was tempted for a minute or so until it occured to me too many for too little . Ususally what is in the picture is what is for sale . These are good pen . I own all of them and was tempted to buy more if this was all shown . My stars are for the listing not the pens .	-1
I love love Pentel EnerGel pens and have sung their praises before . They really provide the smoothest writing ever , with no ink skipping , and because they 're quick drying I do n't have any problems with smeared ink ( I 'm left-handed ) .I own all colors of the EnerGel pens ( red , black , blue , purple , and green ) and for some reason the green pens I have just are n't made as well . The ink skips like crazy and when I write it 's noticeably less smooth than the other four pen colors . After a couple of days , it seemed like the ink was drying up which was strange since it was still relatively new and not often used ; I unscrewed it and found the ink chamber almost completely full and yet the pen does n't perform as well as it should . This is n't isolated to just one pen - I bought four green pens ( two different packs of two pens ) , and they all have the same problem . The body of the pen I 'm currently using has also cracked in two different places , which is annoying as sometimes the pen will just spring open as I 'm writing.EnerGel pens are still far and away the best writing instrument I have used in years , and these wonky green pens wo n't deter me from purchasing the other colors in the future , but I 'm not sure why the green in particular are so bad .	-1
One thing I really like about HP ink is that the printer head is in the cartridge . This may account for slightly higher cost . Really it 's probably more to prevent pirate cartridges than to provide a better experience for the customer , but it has its advantages . Where many printers will get damaged by running the ink low , the only risk you have with a HP is damaging the printer cartridge , which will be out of ink anyway . You have less risk.The ink is good quality and lasts a long time . We do n't print very often , but when we do the pages always look very clear . Past HP 96 ink has lasted well past its expiration date and still performed well . Our color ink cartridge ( HP 97 ) is many years past expiration and still seems to work on the rare occasions we print something in color . HP is my favorite printer company.I notice some have commented on the company selling the cartridges . The proper place for company comments/reviews are in the feedback for the seller not in the product review . Sellers may be replaced by Amazon as time passes.Update 05/22/10 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I just had the first of two cartridges fail on me . It started printing out garbled lines that were barely legible . This was completely unexpected from a company like HP . I thankfully still have a backup , but that 's a good chunk of money wasted . If this second one dies that quickly , I think I 'll be choosing another printer company next time around .	-1
I gave this one star because I was a little disappointed that the Amazon did n't let me know or whoever was supposed to let me know that the that the P Touch printer that I bought would n't take a power adapter other than that I have no idea because I never got a chance to use it thank you . Bjwolf	-1
Horrid piece of junk . Not to mention you ca n't find the labels anywhere local . This thing zaps the life out of batteries in just a short 2 hours . I am very unhappy with this . DO N'T BUY IT EVEN IF IT IS A GOOD PRICE !	-1
I have been buying the combo ink 45/78 for years for my printer . I thought I would order from amazon rather than Staples for the first time and boy am I sorry I did . I received a loose unlabeled white cardboard with a color ink cartridge in it , I have not put it in my printer , I am hoping it even works , but I am doubtful . I am thinking it could be really old - or something must be wrong because why would this seller send me 2 separate ink cartridges and one is not even in any packaging ? Not sure where these came from but I will not be ordering from this seller again .	-1
This is the second set I 've owned , 3 handsets per set , so 6 all together . I suspect highly that the good reviews are due to people reviewing the phone too soon after purchasing . It works great for a while and then turns to junk . Both times I 've owned this phone . It 's too late of course to return it and the warranty service stinks . So I get to throw the thing away and try to find a decent phone.Panasonic should be ashamed to produce this piece of junk.Be forewarned - if you buy anyway because of all the good reviews , you 'll most likely be sorry .	-1
I bought this item based on favorable reviews , but unfortunately am returning it . I 'm in a one bedroom apartment , and find that its range is severely limited . It only operates well on line of sight with the base unit .	-1
It is rare that a product gets an `` OMG '' from me . But after just one day with this new phone system , I absolutely love the set . Here are the 2 things that put this phone system squarely at the top of the heap for me : 1 ) Uses ( and comes with ) AAA rechargable NiMH batteries . No more proprietary , expensive , short-life batteries . NiMH batteries are usually good for at least 500 , sometimes 1000 charge cycles , are inexpensive , available everywhere , and THANK YOU Panasonic for this design feature ; 2 ) The sound quality is excellent : both through the handset speaker ... AND ... the speakerphone built into the handset.Want to attach a belt-clip ? Comes with it . Want to attach a headset ? Comes with a jack . About a dozen built-in ringtones of which you 'll surely not hate one . Set the time on one handset , and it communicates that setting to all the other phones in the system . You can listen to messages on the answering system from any handset . You can conference 2 handsets and the outside call . All these represent limitations of in my previous Uniden set.I am so happy with this Panasonic phone system.EDIT : or ... at least I was . After 2 1/2 years , 2 of the 3 handsets are unable to charge batteries or properly display battery level . This is unacceptable product quality/reliability . Sorry , I take back the 5 stars and award 2 . And I think that is generous .	-1
Speaking as a loyal Panasonic phone owner for years ... I 'm a bit surprised by the flood of good reviews on this phone , my experience has been the opposite.When I saw some of the negative reviews , I glanced over and then dismissed them , figuring they were just the exception based on a purchaser getting a lemon or folks that did n't understand the technology very well . The minority seems to have it right in this case.PROBLEM : The primary problem was an issue with the sound of my voice cutting in and out when I was on a call ( your voice is fed back through the handset speaker normally ) . Many people may not realize that phones normally feedback your voice into the ear speaker until it ceases to work properly ( as with these phones ) . When it happened , my first reaction was that the line had dropped and I would start saying `` are you there , are you there ? '' . When the other person invariably said `` yes '' , I began to realize it was the phone malfunctioning . Another problem is static on the phone occurring randomly on calls . We 've never had that problem until these new phones were put in.I am returning the phones because of these two issues . However , there are some pretty glaring design issues I 'd also like to draw your attention to.DESIGN DISAPPOINTMENTS ( design points that make me wonder , with lots of frustration , what Panasonic engineers were thinking ) : -- Unlit keypad ( I knew about this from other reviews , but seriously , previous Panasonic phones had lit keyboards , what genius decides to go backwards on a key feature like this ) -- Non-dedicated key for voicemail ( yes , this phone has an answering machine , but I ca n't buy a non-answering machine phone anymore , thank you Panasonic ... they could at least recognize that a fair amount of people will use voicemail and design with that in mind , their previous phones had that ) -- Cheap feel to the phone itself ( felt and looked like a cheap plastic kids toy ) -- Clunky menus . The menus on the handset were not natural to flow through . It is not that hard to take the time to make use and flow of menus an easy and non-confusing thing . These felt like an after-thought.The sad thing ? I am going to stay with Panasonic since they still have the best quality phone in my mind , it just happens to be a phone they no longer produce and sell , the KX-TGA520M series phone . Looks like I 'll be shopping eBay and Amazon marketplace.Really disappointed with the direction Panasonic is going in with their phones .	-1
My wife is a dentist and I purchased the l7780 ( same model as l7680 but with extra paper tray attachment included ) for her brand new office after seeing many glowing video reviews praising the speed and low print costs.The printer itself is a marvel , with lightning fast print output and decent color reproduction . The fax and scan functions are very quick and seem to work pretty well.Unfortunately that 's where the praise ends . The HP software installation package is one of the worst I have ever seen ( and that 's coming from someone who has worked in the computer business for years ) . I needed to install the print/photo utilities on five brand new Dell XP Pro workstations that had a very simple initial configuration . The HP installation software would hang , it would n't clean up upon un-install , it would n't see the printer on the cabled ethernet network from one computer but would from another one ( with firewalls turned off on all of them ) , and the real clincher ? The stupid printer management utility is a resource hog that frequently crashes the PC with a bluescreen error or prevents logging out or shutting down.This is unaccepteable under any circumstance , but even worse since this is being used in a Dental office where the staff are dealing with patient data and expect a stable print/scan/fax experience.HP tech support is worthless . HP would rather save a few bucks and outsource the tech support and software/driver development to India than develop a product that cost $ 100 more and actually worked properly.Shame on you HP , you wo n't be getting another dollar from me .	-1
I live in an old school full of dry erase boards , so I have a lot of old shadowy dry erase ghosting on the boards , so I was really excited to try a product capable of removing even permanent marker by just adding water , as these purport to do.They do not . You can scrub your butt off , but they wo n't even remove old dry erase , much less permanent marker.The only thing they will remove is fresh dry erase , which you can already remove with anything from a kleenex to the side of your hand . Total bust .	-1
I am a teacher and tried these out last Friday . I use my whiteboard all the time , so I figured these would be a great solution for easily cleaning my board without having to use any sprays . The white spongy side worked fine- not great , but fine- it took off the marker and left some ghost writing , just like my standard erasers do . I read the instructions about getting the sponge wet to remove the ghost writing , so I tried it ... all it did was smear any writing that was there ( I tried it both with writing on and off the board ) and leave huge water marks behind.Before writing this review , I came to see what others were writing and I was really confused with all the 4-5 star ratings on these erasers . I figured I did something wrong , so I gave the erasers a second chance . I tried again- following the instructions , as I thought I did before- and had the same problems . I was comforted to see another low review from someone who experienced similar problems.Since these are just sponges , they do n't seem like they 're going to last very long . I 'd rather stick with my standard whiteboard erasers that are less expensive but do the job just fine .	-1
Who was the idiot who came up with the idea for whiteboards in the workplace ? What exactly was wrong with blackboards and chalk ? Every company I visit , no matter how how high tech or cool , has nonfunctional whiteboards . The markers are inevitably dried out - which one does not find out until they are tried , followed by a frantic search for fresh markers . This little dance is repeated a million times every day in conference rooms across America . Then the marks are impossible to clean by dry rubbing . Even at their best , whiteboard drawings look ugly compared to elegant , organic chalk on slate . But they 're cheap you say ? Cheap to buy maybe . But let 's compare the time and motion involved in erasing a blackboard vs. whiteboard . Ready ? Here we go : Need to erase blackboard . Implement the following steps:1 . Rub eraser on blackboard . In a pinch , use your hand.Need to erase whiteboard . Implement the following steps:1 . Root around until you find your 3M Whiteboard Eraser . Take it to breakroom sink.2 . Run water on it.3 . Your hands are now wet . Dry them with paper towels.4 . Walk back to conference room trying to hold dripping 3M Whiteboard Eraser without getting water on your clothes.5 . Wipe whiteboard with dripping 3MWE.6 . Whiteboard marks have now been , not removed exactly , but rather smeared into large wet diluted splotches.7 . Go back to breakroom for more paper towels.8 . Back to conference room to wipe up and dry whiteboard . Discard paper towels.9 . Back to breakroom to wash your hands again and dry.10 . Need to erase again ? 3MWE has dried out , take it back to water faucet ..Let 's see , assuming average industrial cost of a professional with overhead of $ 100 per hour , and we estimate the company has just spent about 25 bucks ( not counting the paper towels , water and trash removal ) to ERASE THE WHITEBOARD ..	-1
Out of the bag , I tried the dry sponge on my white board which had residual ghost marks from previous usage . The dry sponge removed some of the marks , but not all . I dipped the sponge in water , squeezed most of it out and once applied found it did a great job of smearing dirty marker water around on the board . I checked the package to see if I was using it correctly - if maybe I was supposed to flip it over to use the blue side in any way - but the package only states the blue side to be used for easy gripping ... There were a few stubborn marks on the board that no amount of cleaning with the dry or wet white side would remove . I tried the blue side which seems to be more abrasive and it did clean them off without much effort- it did a good job of cleaning up the wet mess that the white side left behind.I find it odd that a pair of sponges would be so pricey and require somewhat a better explanation on how to use them . I would not likely purchase these in the future .	-1
Nothing to overwhelm anyone here.THE GOOD : ( use ) I gave two stars ( rather than one ) because they do the job ( which is really what you want ) . They erase the whiteboard , about the same as our other erasers . If they erase better , it 's only slight ( not enough for me to notice - I still had Expo black ink dry-erase marker marks on my board before and after using them ) .THE BAD : ( design ) 1 . They look & feel a lot like a kitchen sponge , and have no visible indication that they 're not . In a multi-user setting , only word-of-mouth can tell someone that this unusual looking eraser is just that ( and it 's a matter of time before someone either uses these as a sponge or replaces one of them with a sponge ) .2 . Traditional whiteboard erasers are heavy enough on one side to stay on a narrow maker tray even if bigger than the tray itself . These are very light , and not weighted on one side , so they wo n't stay on our marker tray . The result makes problem # 1 bigger , since this `` sponge '' sits somewhere else in the room , without an explanation as to what it is.MY ADVICE : If for a single user , and about the same price as other markers , great . If it 's for a group setting , consider something else .	-1
I was hoping that this product would erase the marks on my dry erase boards that wo n't come off with my usual paper-towel-and-rubbing-alcohol method . It did n't . It might have lightened them a little when I wet it and scrubbed hard , but I 'm not sure of it . The marks are still visible , in any case . So this product does n't do much more than my much cheaper paper towel and alcohol method . I 'll keep looking for something that does .	-1
The 3M whiteboard eraser appears to be just a blue sponge glued to the top of a white sponge . There is no odor , which is good , so I ca n't tell if there is any special cleanser embedded in the sponges or not . I first tried the eraser on an old white board that I have had hanging on my fridge for years . Over time it has become a `` gray board '' and there were many remnants of old dry erase markers left on it . I was really hoping that this eraser would clean the board and make it less of an eyesore . It did remove some of the residual , but not nearly what I had expected it to take off . I scrubbed a little harder and more did come off . I wet the sponge to see if that helped and it did improve it quite a bit . I have a couple of the Mr Clean Magic Erasers and I decided to try one of those on an area of the whiteboard that I had not yet tried to clean with the 3M eraser . The Mr. Clean eraser worked just as well on the dry erase marker as the 3M eraser did . It also costs less than the 3M . However , the 3M eraser completely removed permanent ink whereas there was still a shadow of the ink left after using the Mr Clean sponge.Since the Mr Clean Magic Eraser works well on other surfaces besides a whiteboard , I would not recommend purchasing the 3M Whiteboard Eraser if you will have only dry erase/wet erase markers to clean up . On the other hand , if you have a whiteboard that has been written on with a Sharpie or other permanent marker , the 3M eraser is definitely the thing to use .	-1
Update : Watch out for this one ... ... . I have my 27 '' iMac on it . A full 8lbs under the maximum . It is now sagging . I could probably cut a piece of wood and make a pier to place in the middle ... . but I plan on replacing this and using it with my printer ... ... ... avoid getting this if your computer is ( my best guess ) more than 15lbs.I purchased this to use with my 27inch iMac . The iMac weights in at 30lbs so it is 10 under the max for this stand . I looked at many stands at local stores . Had trouble finding one that would give the height I needed and still be able to handle the iMac . I am 6'6 '' tall so I needed something with height . The stand appears to be well made . It blends in well with my glass/metal computer unit . If you are needing something for height this is it . The keyboard easily fits beneath it if you want.UPDATE : Someone had mentioned it sagged ... .. made me hesitate on buying it ... .. glad I took a chance . I placed a few books so that they just barely touched the middle of the underside of the stand . Now after many weeks it has not sagged at all .	-1
For the past few years , I have used Epson 2200 ( first ) , Epson 1400 , and an Epson 260 printers . Initially , they were good printers . Once I started to replace ink cartridges the $ $ $ began to flow . Between cleaning the print heads almost constantly and doing repeated nozzle checks , I had to think there must be some other way . I finally did have one of my 2200 's serviced and the cost was about half what the printer cost ; plus the nearest authorized service center is in a neighboring state ( 75 miles ) . And it did n't take long before I was back to square one on that particular printer . I put it on the street next to the garbage can and nobody even tried to pick it up . So I put it IN the can . The print heads are difficult to clean ; require constant attention , and the ink is prohibitively expensive , if you purchase genuine Epson cartridges . Third party inks work , but sources change and so does the formulation apparently of the ink . This only adds to the cleaning problems . While they are working , Epson printers are great . I fiddled with them for almost 6 years . No more ; purchased a pair of Canon printers . I had owned a Canon I9900 that I gave away when I decided to switch over to Epson . Ironically , the I9900 is now on its third owner and is still in service . So much for Epson .

This is the last epson I will have die on me , never again after the fourth one was only a month old and on its first ink change.What happens : You run out of ink and replace a cartridge . This causes a nozzle cleaning cycle to run . Nozzles that were working FINE before are now CLOGGED because epson cant figure out how to purge their ink properly . They get gummed up.Epson 's solution ? Run another cleaning cycle - which makes the problem WORSE ! They can only be fixed by a technician via complicated disassembly that costs more in labor than the darned printer is worth.This is my second dead epson in one month . They print amazing when they print right but that is n't often enough for the price.Never again , Epson ... never again .	-1
While these handing folders are a really good idea , they are a bit too stiff and do n't seem to hang well in any file cabinet or holder in which I tried them . They were always too bulky and did n't fit on the rods well . If someone were going to use these with a really deep cabinet that had a lot of bottom clearance , they would probably work out fine . However , for the average letter size file cabinet or travel file carrier , these are a bit more pain then they are worth . I would probably stick with traditionally sized file folders . Again , the 2 inch expansion would be great , but the expansion seemed to elongate the file folder to be too tall to fit comfortable and securely in place . Will definitely pass on these in the future .	-1
One thing to love , the bright primary colors of yellow , red and blue of the folders.So many things to hate about these hanging folders ! Everything about these folders seems to be do it yourself.First of all , to make them square on the bottom you have to put this long strip of cardboard into the bottom of each folder which you also have to pull apart each piece of cardboard , which is hard enough in itself as far as getting the cardboard ends to stay in the bottom of each folder . I used a little piece of tape to secure the cardboard on each end of the folder.The folder itself , it does n't seem to be any thicker , maybe even thinner than Pendaflex file folders.Instead of the cardboard they included which is n't very thick , it would have made the bottom of the folders more rigid/durable , stand easier , if they had used some kind of durable plastic instead of cardboard , which would have made much more sense to make them more square on the bottom of each folder.Since most people do n't put the same amounts of paper in each folder , it was n't fun to get the folders to fit in correctly , to lay flat on the bottom of each folder in either my file box in my desk , or this big file box that I have in my bedroom.Then the white ends of each folder that makes them hang , it kept finding it 's way into the sleeve of my blouse.Then they include this sheet of paper and plastic covers for you to put onto each folder so that it would show what is in each folder . I did n't use these either . Iam not sure if the paper would even stay in the plastic covers.While I was doing all of this I decided to change out each manila folder to a new one . To do two chores at once , so that I wo n't have to bother with any of this for a long time.I just do n't see any added benefit to having this kind of hanging folder , or any improvement what so ever to having this kind of hanging folder ! ! I only used about half of the box of 25 folders that they included , before I decided to call it a day with these folders.If you want hanging folders , I would just use these hanging folders without the included cardboard for the bottom of each folder , which does n't seem to have any added benefit.I would also forgo the paper/plastic part you are supposed to put onto the top of each folder to show what is in each hanging folder.You can just use manila folders , or whatever kind of folders you like that have a place to write on the tab part , to show what is in each folder.I also used some label tape to show what is in each folder.For a company to make what should be such an easy thing to use , how did they end up deciding that doing it this way was a good way to do it ? If you like feeling frustrated/aggravated , this might be the perfect product for you to use !	-1
The wrap that I was sent by one of the 3rd party sellers was not the name-brand advertised here.While the wrap has worked well enough , it was not what I paid for . I have tried several times to leave a review only to have it rejected . I am continue to be disappointed with the ever-declining quality of what used to be a good site .	-1
This is a roll of bubble wrap which is just fine . The packaging is way too big , about 3 times what is needed . This has an effect on the decision to purchase this as you have to get rid of the waste	-1
All the reviews about this product HP74XL seem all about different manufacturers.I did n't even open the box and I am returning this as the company put a label over the expiration date . I bought this on 9/7/13 and it looks like under their label it says March 2013.Surely if they did n't have anything to hide they would not have covered the information.Please shop elsewhere.Julia	-1

My wife got this to help keep up a current grocery list . She had seen it on TV and thought it would be easy to use . She used it for about a year but it is not the answer to all your problems . While it works to some extent , writing a list is easier . My wife liked this product and used it but it had several problems which we listed below.Finally we got an app for our smart phones and created a shopping list that even synchronizes between our two phones . It is easier and faster and we both have the same list . I am sorry to say that we do not use this SmartShopper anymore . We just wished it had been all we expected from the product promotion.Pros:1 . Voice recognition of your grocery items ( Per their specs ) 2 . 2500 preloaded items and it lets you add custom items3 . Thermal paper with no ink required4 . Magnetic case sticks to side of the refrigeratorCons:1 . It refuses to recognize some words and after you have to say it 5 times or more you could have written it down . The voice recognition system was not that great . Trying to create a list of 10 to 15 items it easier to just to write them down . It can be frustrating and very time consuming ! 2 . It eats batteries like crazy and it takes 4 AA batteries at a time.3 . When we first got ours the paper was fairly expensive and the shipping cost was more than the paper . It is lower now with free shipping but not at first.We basically lost interest in trying to get it to work properly . There were better and faster solutions .	-1

Have had this printer for about 2 years . It still works but tends to drive me crazy.NEGATIVES1 . If it turns off , it requires me to either print a test page or cancel a test page-both take about 1 minute2 . The software sometimes just break . I 've had to uninstall and reinstall everything multiple times3 . The buttons on the printer with/without connection to my laptop also sometimes decide not to work4 . It was really difficult to use until I learned to use the HP solution center5 . Ink is not cheap6 . No document feeder-so takes forever to scan/copy multiple pages7 . No wireless printingPOSITIVES1 . It still prints , copies , and scans-well most of the timeQuality of print and speed of printing is average at bestThis thing is defintely outdated for now . Go to wal-mart/best buy and you could find a newer better model for half the price listed here .	-1
I use to love HP product but in the later years the quality went down hill . I own this printer for few years and I have nothing but problems with it . I use it maybe once or twice a month . I figure , I do n't print enough for me to spend a lot of money , but this thing is an absolute junk ! when it decide to work it does a real nice job but it can stop working after 2 pages claiming the ink cartridge is missing ... you have to open the door and re-install it , after 5 tries you might be lucky and it will print again . I have it so long that this thing keeps doing the same thing over and over ! stay away ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I needed this for a university course.I hate the non-lighted screen . Hate It . You have to be sure you have a little lamp or etc . with you if you are going to be in any sort of shade , if you do n't want to develop a headache.The keyboard should be lighted too , ideally . It 's not the easiest thing to read.The learning curve to use this seems to high to me . The manual is n't very helpful ; I need to know how to use it for the things I 'm doing in class and on tests . The ends up requiring actually & # 34 ; studying & # 34 ; just how to use this calculator using online tutorials etc . It is n't a very intuitive device . I suppose that is just the nature of the beast , as they say ; but it seems that if I can manually calculate something nearly as fast as it is taking me to fiddle with this device , it 's not all that helpful.As others have noted , it is a little slow if you are used to current technology.It 's awkward to hold and handle ; I have small hands , but not like freakishly small.It is n't well designed for handling . It does n't sit at a good angle naturally for use . You need to try to prop it up a bit , but then when you try to use the buttons , it wants to squirm around and just generally be a pain.It 's clunky and bulky . I guess that had to be , based upon the number of buttons . But if I 'd had the option from my professor , I would have liked to use something that maybe was more stylus oriented ( if such a calculator exists ) ; less buttons , more pushing on-screen choices to tell it what you want to do next.Oh well ; I guess my complaints are sort of irrelevant , since this is what this is .	-1

The scanner I used in 1999 was better and easier to install than the Strobe XP 220.Installation Process from hellThe installation process was a nightmare . Brought me back memories from hardware installations dating back to 1999 , nay ... 1997 . The scanner is connected through chunky Y cable ; Y split from the power adapter for USB connection to the computer and connection to the scanner . It was cumbersome and annoying . The cable is heavier than the scanner itself and often made it tilt under the weight of it . The scanner took hours to install , 2 CDs , adding tons of bloated software to my computer and my waning patience finally snapping . After all of that , the scanner refused to work . I had no idea whether it was on since the designers of this `` product '' deemed an ON switch or light was unnecessary . I left the Strobe-craptastic-scanner for another day.Getting it to workA week later I returned to the task of trying to make the crap-scanner work . It will work this time , sure it will , I mused trying to fool myself into wasting more time on scanner-fail . I connected the scanner to the computer and waited for my computer to recognize it . And I waited ... and waited ... and kept waiting . Since there is no ON button or nice green light to let me know whether this crapshoot was even on , I went onto prodding and clicking any and all buttons McCrappy had . Alas , there was only one grey button at the side . I pressed . Nothing . Pressed again . Nothing . Pressed and Held . Nada.Finally , as if by some miracle , my computer recognized it and told me to calibrate it . I hastened with a semi-victorious hope ( maybe this will work ! ) and inserted the calibration page and waited ... waited some more . Page aligned with the arrows ? Check . Is the Crap-scanner on ? No way to check . Grey button ? Pressed . Nada . Check another electric plug ? Nothing . Restarting the computer ? Nothing worked . Finally , after the 10th unplug/plug back in of the cables ... it worked ! ! ! ! So , I quickly calibrated , before it decided to bail out on me again . Then I put in a test page for scanning.SoftwareIt has an unfriendly interface . Full of useless stuff and meager setting options.Black and White scanningThe text was clear but lopsided . A LOT . I calibrated again . Lopsided again . Calibrated again and still lopsided . Black and white photo scanning had terrible quality.Color ScanningLet me laugh a bit here as I review the `` color '' scanning . Yes , there was color and there was scanning . Scanning the photo it looked like a pictured taken with a 1 MegaPixel camera , the ones you would find 10 years ago then scanned by a scanner of also 10 years ago . There were vertical lines running through the picture scan . It was bloody awful . Yes , I did scan on picture mode and played around with the settings to try to make It better . I checked the settings , the highest resolution was 600 dpi ! ( See shared pictures above . ) ConclusionBloody awful crap-tastic scanner . : D	-1
Summary : The Visioneer Strobe 220 has great specs , moderate performance and is absolutely 5-10 years behind in user interface . The installation even feels older . That said , it scans OK and the software bundle includes the excellent Omnipage Professional 15 and the venerable Paperport 11.Pros : Nice bundle with scanner hardware , drivers , OCR software ( Omnipage Pro 15 ) and organizer software ( Paperport 11 ) . These appear to be full versions and work in their function.Good price for the bundle.The scanner is fast enough that it is n't an issue for a few pages ( seemed like & lt ; 10 seconds for a full page at 300dpi ) .The scanner is quiet and does not seem any more noisy than the other sheetfeed scanners I have ( Fujitsu ScanSnap , Brother 8660DN ) . Very tolerable.The size of the scanner is small and does not take up a lot of desk space , for the scanner itself.There are two settings for the output side of the scanner so that it can accommodate both thin and thick paper.Cons : Installation process is from Hell , or perhaps 1995 . Probably in between as it uses the net , poorly . ** Do n't bother with the Nuance registration , which is a lot of the problem . Just register later or send in the form USPS if you must . The online process is a mess.For some reason , they needed two disks for the install ; perhaps they used CDs.The scanner unit is small , but the cable is HUGE . It is supposed to be USB , but it is a special Y cable that has a connection to the power brick integrated into it and a proprietary connector on the scanner side . The cable is about the thickness of most VGA cables.The software has amazing issues such as making the default scan size 8.5 '' x 14 '' which is US Legal pad . It apparently can not be set to default to US Letter . Stupid , just plain stupid.Scan quality is just OK. Good enough to make the OCR work.Summary : This is less for less . Get something else that speaks Mac as well as PC . There are a lot of choices in this price range . In the bargain , you can get software from this decade , too . Most of the copyrights for this software included are in the mid 2000 's .	-1
The laminator works well enough as advertised . However , for the price , the Scotch Laminator featuredScotch TL901 Thermal Laminator 2 Roller Systemhere will do BOTH 3 mil and the thicker 5 mil sheets . This laminator only handles 3 mil sheets . We own the Scotch Laminator as well as this one and can definitely recommend the Scotch Laminator over it.Well , to be fair , it states that it can handle 5 mil sheets ... as long as the 12.5 '' wide mouth is fed something that is the size of an index card or smaller.Pass on this .	-1
Bought it in August 2009 and by November 2009 , it stopped working ! No , I did n't do an extraordinary amount of shredding . In fact , I did very little . Do n't recommend it .	-1
returning ; it 's not a cross cut shredder ; my mistake because it states that it is stip shredder in the copy .	-1
The shredder is advertised to be able to shred CD 's . After 3 or 4 CD 's , the feeder jammed and it ALSO jammed the paper shredder . All I had was a piece of junk on my hands . Based on my experience , it would not even be worth the effort to have it replaced .	-1
The shredder is exactly as pictured , and it does in fact make confetti style cuts which adds that little extra security to what you 're shredding . If you insert a single page of non-folded paper at a time it works beautifully . If you shred a single credit card , it slows down but it manages . Anything above 2 pages together , or a folded page , and it jams up . Also , make sure you take any mail out of the envelopes with the clear plastic window because that should n't go in a shredder . What caused it to jam beyond repair the very first time I used it : Two pieces of paper that had been folded in half , so the thickness of 4 pages essentially . The description clearly indicates it can handle up to 8 sheets at a time , good luck with that . I have removed the lid and hand picked out every visible piece of paper , I have tried multiple times to utilize the reverse option , and nothing works . The printer was taken out after 20 minutes of use . I will update if I ever get it to work again . ***Update : A pair of scissors , a credit card , and questionable decisions later we now have a working shredder again . It still struggles to function if you run more than a sheet , maybe two , at a time . It regained one star for the fact that it is up and running again but loses three because it still sucks but at least I can painstakingly shred a single item at a time into confetti .	-1
I put 4 sheets folded in half into the shredder and rather than cutting it up , this shredder only managed to mangle the pieces . I actually pulled out a part of the document the size of the palm of my hand and could easily still read the information on it , though it was punctured and torn ( but still intact ) . Even the pieces that did managed to get `` shredded '' were far too large for a cross-cut shredder , in my opinion . If you want security , try another brand .	-1
Two shredding sessions on the first day ... 10-15 minutes each . Then it died . Amazon replaced it promptly - but that one did n't work at all out of the box . Returning for a refund . I will look for another brand of shredder .	-1
Following product guidelines I NEVER inserted more than 4/5 pieces of paper at a time or even used it beyond twenty minutes and even used the proper shredder oil/paper and having now become somewhat of an expert on throw away shredders - This is no better than the rest and an absolute horror at the dreaded paper jam . Confetti shredders have a tendency to bulk and plug making it tedious work to un-jam . This was the worst of the bunch I 've own lately.Its only saving grace was when it did work ( which was for about six weeks give or take ) it worked well . That being said , six weeks is n't worth it.Granted I have been doing quite a bit of shredding - still with proper use and not overuse as initally described it should have been able to handle the work load .	-1
I 'm so disapointed to have to come back to Amazon and edit my product review . I had originally given this product an enthusiastic 5 stars , and was delighted with my purchase.I used the scales regularly for over 6 months without any problems at all . The product was easy to use , and seemed very accurate . Then , suddenly , one day I got a `` low battery '' message.Did n't worry about it at first because I had n't been sure how much power was left in the battery when I had installed them in the product . I replaced the battery and all seemed to be fine again.Next day , I got another `` low battery '' message . Hoping that maybe I just got unlucky and had used a defective battery or something , I changed the batteries ( I had to go out to the store to buy more , so these were definitely new ) and , again , the product okay . This time , only long enough to let me weigh another three packages . Then I got the low battery message again.I could n't find the AC adapter , so in frustration , I was checking the battery compartment to see if there was any obvious problem - like a loose connection , maybe . As I was checking , I noticed that as the battery was almost completely removed from the device , it suddenly started working again.Hm.So I continued to use the scales like that for a few days - with it working for a few minutes , then giving me low battery , and then working again . What was strange was that it continued to display the time without any problems at all ! Eventually , I gave up and had to buy a new one . The new one came , and worked fine for two days . Then I got the same problem ! Luckily , I have the AC adapted for this one , so I can use that . But it really makes things less convenient.I 'm so sorry I 'm having such problems with the product , because it was perfect until this started happening . I looked into other scales , but I have n't been able to find anything that I like/is within my price range .	-1
These seem to have a problem . Most of the tear strips are loose , and when you try to seal the envelope , it will not stick , and you have to tape . Not satisfactory	-1
I bought this to use with my laptop at home . But there are a number of problems with it -- all of which are simple things that they should have fixed : ( 1 ) Why include a keyboard and not a mouse ? I had to buy this separately . ( 2 ) Why only 3 USB parts ? ( 3 ) The station needs to be plugged in to work ... so the keyboard will not work when plugged into the USB port of my laptop unless I have also plugged in the adaptor . Why ? Other wireless keyboards do n't have this requirement . ( 4 ) My external hard drive will not work when plugged into one of the 3 ports on this device - so I had to get a separate port replicator for this . ( 5 ) The plug on the device is too short - it could n't make the short trip from the dining room table to the wall outlet - so I had to get an adaptor.Basically , you 're paying for a hunk of plastic to prop up your laptop monitor , plus a wireless keyboard , plus a fairly poor port replicator.If I had it to do over again , I would purchase the PCI docking station for home usage from Toshiba . I would lose the monitor stand , but I would be able to do more with this replicator.Toshiba PA3542U-2PRP Dynadock USB Laptop Docking Station with DVI Port	-1
The colors are a bit obnoxious . Maybe more for hypno-breeder-scrapbookers aka soccer-mom-crafter-artistwannabees . Otherwise , if you are a serious artist , probably skip . The glaze pens are kind of limited to what they can do and not as nice even flow as typical quality Sakura pens .	-1
I usually love Sakura and I was excited about the colors to use on my Fuzzy Velvet Posters but these are sooo wet ! They slop all over the place , you have to use a toothpick to push the paint into where you want it because if you put the pen where you want the color , it winds up everywhere BUT ! I 'm returning these and wo n't ever buy these particular ones again . Sakura is consistently wonderful but these pens suck badly .	-1
This cartridge lasted exactly one month for our office . We print about 100 color pages a day , 5 days a week . Figure it lasted only 2000 pages or so . The original toner that came with the printer lasted longer . Odd .	-1
Skip the high yield cartridges . They leak everywhere . I am going back to the low yield . I have had problems with 2 of 4 thus far , and I am only 3 months into the cartridges .	-1
I own the XP-310 Epson printer , not this model . However , there is some corporate greed technology in the XP-310 that is most likely in all of their printers.I actually really liked my Epson printer until it came time to replace the ink cartridges . I always look at the replacement cartridge prices before I buy , and the Epson were cheap . However , I soon found out that the minds at Epson went to VERY great lengths to make sure you can use only genuine , way-over priced genuine Epson cartridges in their printer . The aftermarket cartridges won & # 8217 ; t be & # 8220 ; recognized & # 8221 ; by the printer , and even the empty refillable cartridges won & # 8217 ; t work either . Don & # 8217 ; t bother with the bottles of ink to refill your existing Epson cartridges , for that won & # 8217 ; t work either.I could have bought 4 black and 2 each of the other three colors for $ 14 for the aftermarket products . Instead , the cheapest I could find for the same 10 Epson cartridges cost over $ 80 . Actually they weren & # 8217 ; t the same , the aftermarket were the larger capacity ( model 200XL ) where the Epson cartridges at $ 80 were the smaller capacity ( model 200 ) .Maybe other or even all other printer makers do this same thing , as I don & # 8217 ; t buy printers often . In the mean time I will have my old Canon printer repaired and use the Epson only for scanning and copying .	-1
I bought this just to print on discs . When I got it , it would not print on the entire disc , so I called Epson . After having me do some tests , they said they would send another . That did n't work , either , so they sent another . I now have three , and not one will print on discs . If you want an excellent disc printer , get an HP 5280 All-in-One .	-1
I printed one 8X10 and 12 DVDs before the ink carts went dry , starting with yellow . I thought this has to be a mistake . Nope . This is an Epson.A total piece of junk .	-1
My partner and I purchased this printer ( not from Amazon ) about 1 and 1/2 Years ago . Setup was EZ , We only printed 4 CDs and 8 Documents before it told us it was out of ink . My ... . that was fast I thought ? Cartridges cost 85.00 dollars ( for all 6 ) , and low and behold , the printer was out of ink again just after 15 days ( 15 documents , 4 photos and 2 CDs ) . All this for 85.00 ? No thanks . We noticed the printer spend more time cleaning itself than printing . Total Junk and Ink-thirsty . We dumped it.and bought a laser ( at least the toner did n't run out until 5 months - and we use it daily ! ) The WJ Group - ( Danxo )	-1
I only got 1/4 of the life of this cartridge . I , like others am going back to the low yield . Clearly there is a problem with these cartridges . They should be pulled .	-1
I owned a 9840CDW for almost two years . The print quality is really bad . After a few hundred pages , I see streaks run down the pages . I also see stains . This happens to the original black and blue toners . After I replaced them , the problem went away for only a few hundred pages . Then it came back for black toner . I checked the manual and found that we have to clean two areas . One is the drum unit . It produces equally spaced stains on the page . The other is the spill of the toner . I have to constantly clean it.Brother has a unique design that toner cartridges and drum units are separate . So you do n't have to replace them all together like other brands . . All the Brother color printers share this design . They all use the same toner cartridges and drum units . It apparently reduces the production cost greatly . But it seems to me that with this design toner cartridges and drum units are very flimsy . I have done the cleaning of toner carriages and drum unit so many times that I can do that without taking out the drum unit . I never have to do this to other laser printers . And I never know so much detail about laser printers before I own a Brother printer.If unfortunately you own one and would like to keep it , the other thing you have to watch out is the cost of toner . It will stop working after a preset number of pages even you still have a lot of toner in it . You can follow the instruction below to reset the toner cartridge . It will save you a lot of money.Amazon wo n't let me post the url . Please search the web for the instruction . You have to open the cap and turn back the wheel in the cartridge . Good luck .	-1
Fell apart within two weeks . Had to return . Case It has the worst quality I have ever seen in binders . Would not recommend .	-1
Even though there are many positive reviews , this machine is useless unless your faxing needs are limited to a page a day . Cartridges a very very expensive and you will go though many of them even with small regular use . Much happier with the Brother laser machine that replaced this one .	-1
To be fair , I knew going into this that this machine did n't have great reviews , but neither did any other fax machine in this price range . I 've owned it for a year and a half and I do very infrequent faxing ( probably 2-3 times per month ) .First , the ringer is startlingly loud and has no volume adjustment , so I had to go to `` silent mode . '' That 's not a great option , either , because you have to stand there and stare at the display to figure out if it 's working and sending the fax.Then I have to stand there and feed in one page at a time . It does n't work any other way . And even when I do feed one page at a time , it very often cuts me off and thinks I 'm done before I 'm done ... you have to catch it soooo fast after it 's done with one page and quickly sneak the next page in , or it 'll just go ahead and send.I have no idea about print quality because I 've used it only to send outgoing faxes . I 've never once received an incoming fax ( I use an online fax service for that ) , so I 've never used the ink cartridge ... which I just discovered tonight is no good , because apparently it tried to print out some kind of report , which came out blank . Now I have no idea if it was an error report ( I assume so , but it looked like the fax went through ) .There is no catch tray , so the papers wind up all over the floor if I do n't stand there and grab them one at a time as they go through the fax.Anyway , I thought I could put up with just about anything because I need it so infrequently , but it 's still very frustrating . There should be a basic , simple , decent model at this price point .	-1
This fax machine is a really bad design . I hate that it uses a very expensive inkjet cartridge because the cartridge dries up quickly if you do n't receive faxes often or use it as a copier often ; so it 's a really poor design . I got the Brother 575 fax machine instead for less money . It 's a better design for a fax machine in this price range because it does n't use an inkjet cartridge that just dries up when you are not using it . Further , the Brother replacement ink ribbon is half the cost of the HP inkject cartridge for this fax machine.I would recommend you avoid this unit .	-1
I have owned a number of printers over the years and this new Kodak 5300 ranks as the absolute worst printer I have ever owned ! I have owned it less than 48 hrs . and I have to date 5 calls to Tech support for a number of issues all of which seems to be glitches in the Kodak software . ( I have XP Home on a Dell ) To install it for the 2nd time with tech support on the phone , it took just under an hour . Then it would not print from Word Perfect . Then it would not turn off and the list goes on . Couple this with far East tech support with language issues and you get the picture . Add to this , slow , slow , slow start up , slow print time even in draft , horrible print quality on the higher settings and you have the makings of a real loser ! Kodak needs to stick to cameras and leave the printers to HP , Canon etc . I bought this for the cheap new inks but I wish to heaven I had bought something else now . I am paying the price for wanting cheaper ink cartridges.I bought it on line & the cost to return it would be a fortune . I have learned my lesson . Do n't you make the same mistake !	-1
If you 're like me and have `` grown up '' on HP calculators and were think `` This is it ! HP is back ! '' let me be the first to tell you that , no , HP is not back . The calculator feels a bit more fragile than the earlier generation and is missing some of the well thought out HP calculator innovations that the earlier alphanumerics , such as the legendary HP-41 , hhad . The display does not show the function key you pressed unlike the HP-32s I own . Better yet the HP-41 showed the function and if you made a mistake in hitting the wrong function key , you simply held the key down for 2 seconds the function was nulled.UPDATE : Day 2 . Now the calculator has hung-up with SYNTAX ERROR . I tried all the obvious keystrokes without resorting to the manual to no avail .	-1
I needed to get my keyboard off my desk and this seemed to be a good solution . It was very easy to install if you have a drill . The instructions were easy enough to follow and I was able to install it in about a 1/2 hour.Using it proved a little harder . The quality is decent but it was difficult to pull out and push back in . I suppose a little grease will help but the mouse pad does n't fold up as neatly as pictured . Another aspect I disliked was that in order to use it ( as a corner tray ) you have to pull it out quite far . This put me very far away from my computer monitor and hindered more than helped.The wrist rest is comfortable and it is quite steady when you type on it . Even the mouse tray is steady and has a rim so the mouse wo n't slide off the side.Overall , I do n't recommend it simply for the price . You can get $ 100 trays that are just as good .	-1
I 'm disappointed to give a low rating to these Smead folders , but , bottom line : out of the box , more than half of the folders appeared `` used . `` They 're the product I expected : . hanging ( with the little metal shoulders ) ; . letter-sized ( even slightly roomier ) ; . card-stock ( even slightly heavier ) ; . expandable ( accordion-style , from approx . 1-inch when empty to 3.5-inches when stuffed ) ; . *pocket* file folders ( open only along the top ; the sides and bottom are fully enclosed so contents do n't slip out ) .Advantages include a built-in , 1/3-cut , stand-up tab that you can write on ( eliminating the need for those frustrating plastic tabs and tiny labels ) , and a neutral color that 's just shy of mint green.But although the product 's box arrived taped shut , and all of the folders appeared functionally new , five of the nine had slight bits of dried material or frank areas of wear/scuff . This product is far too expensive for that apparent lack of quality control ; it 's a dealbreaker for me .	-1
Very thin labels , as a result the feed grabs two or three at a time and prints across several pages ruining most of them . If you sit and feed them one sheet at a time , it works , but what a pain that is . The are not worth the money . Do n't waste it on these .	-1
Nothing against this pad compared to other pads like it , BUT in general these soft pads make my optical mouse jump when I am trying to make tiny movements that you need to do when working with graphics.OK here is what I found that works really well ( for me at least ) . My wife gave me one of her cutting boards from the kitchen . Actually she gave me two to try . The first was one of those flexible thin ones and it was ok but the thick one , ( 5/16 & # 34 ; thick ) works wonderful . I think it might be made of nylon or teflon , shrug , but has a real slick feeling to the touch even though it has multiple cuts on it from being used for cutting vegetables over the years .	-1
Bought this Sep. 2011 ( one year ago ) , and it 's been great ( support , comfort , etc . ) except that after one year of use it 's developed `` wrinkles '' so that the mouse does not slide over it smoothly . Since as a mouse pad this item is placed on a flat desk and does not get moved around , for wrinkles to develop is quite disappointing .	-1
The picture shows the correct product , but the picture , the title , and even the package it came in indicated that it contains a starter of 50 3x3 notes , ( also says flags not included on the box ) , arrived with no notes or flags . Kind of a disappointment when you are purchasing as a gift and the receiver has to go out and buy parts for their gift.As for the product , it is well built , sturdy , and looks amazing on a cherry desk .	-1
I love to write ; I am a writer and I also enjoy journaling . At first , I loved the brilliant blue . I never saw anything like it before . It is the most charming thing in the world . However , my watermen pen got clogged and I see sludge all around the nib and the pen felt as if it had mud all over the nip . I become worried . I decided to use another fountain pen , my son 's pen , but same problem occurred . I looked for vinegar bottle and had to soak both pens in the hope of getting rid of that thick stuff , that sludge , that mud-looking thing & # 8230 ; I was sad . I had no choice but to dump it in the garbage basket to go with the garbage for Monday . Thankfully , I still had old Watermann ink cartridges and they will hold me for the time being . I would have loved sincerely to give an exalting review of this ink but I also want to speak my mind .	-1
THIS ORDER IS BAD DRY TOO FAST BUT I 'M NOT EVEN USE IT YET . THIS IS BAD STOCK NOT LAST LONG BOTHER ME HAVE TO GO BUY NEW INK NOW FOR MY PRINTER NEED .	-1
HP has big problems with cartridges and Support of their ink cartridges . I have has 3 cartridges from 2 of these sets that would not be accepted by the printer . This happens when the electronic chip or its programing is defective or is damaged in transit . This is not terribly unusual but 3 in the same week is . All were within 30 days of purchase and all were sealed until they were installed and refused to print . New replacements did work.The real problem comes when you try to get them replaced under warranty . There is no clear way to contact HP . You need to go to the support section and report it as a problem , Then you get a reply asking you to do several things and print a report which can not be printed with a defective cartridge and scan it and send it to them . Failing that they want 13 separate pieces of information most of which are not printed on the cartridge . Then you get a reply that says it will be replaced but you need to fill out another set of questions and give them the serial number of your printer . This is a lot to expect of a consumer who has done nothing more than buy a printer cartridge.So far the single pack cartridges are OK . Stick with them or avoid HP altogether .	-1
I did not have any problems loading the software for this printer.I connected this printer through USB , as printer functions work faster through USB connections , rather than networking.However , when printing Photos , the Skin Tones were Never Correct . The faces were always very dark , as well as the rest of the pictures.After working with HP on this problem for Over 6 hours , and downloading other drivers , the Skin Tones were still the same.I tried just copying some pages and the printer could not pull through the regular 20 # paper . I had to remove the paper several times in trying to get the printer to take the paper.Borderless printing on 4 X 6 paper was OK , and had no trouble pulling it through the printer . Just the paper in the regular bottom tray.Copying was OK for the output , but had trouble pulling the paper through the printer.I never got around to testing the Fax features , as that was not high on my priorities list .	-1
The printer is slow and loud . I thought I was doing great by purchasing a wireless printer . I have had nothing but trouble from the time of purchase ( 6 months or so ago ) until now.The printer says that I am out of paper where there is less than half left in the paper tray , and that is very annoying especially when in another part of the house printing a document just to have to do more work just to print a document.i am now re-installing the software for the third time and the software is a very large bloated program that takes forever to load.The reason for the two stars is when this printer does work , it does an excellent job of getting photos scanned into the computer . again when it works.Other than that , nice piece of expensive garbage .	-1
I had a HP 970cxi for years that was a wonderful workhorse of a printer . It had replaced a loathsome Epson which had convinced me never to own another Epson . Well , *this* HP has convinced me to never own another HP printer.The HP Photosmart C7280 All-in-One may be the worst printer in the history of printers.This printer is _helpful_ . It knows what kind of paper you have and what kind of printing you want to do . It is oh-so-clever about everything . It knows more about what you want to do than you do . Heaven save you from helpful printers . I 'm currently printing CD labels . The printer _helpfully_ notices that the shiny side of my `` photo '' paper is down . It spits out the label sheet ( blank ) and chirpily informs me I need to turn the paper upsidedown . Not really wanting to print my labels on the backing , rather than the label , I stuff the sheet back in and hit okay . Then it chirpily informs me there 's a paper mismatch with the previous type . An okay on this might yield me two uninterrupted sheets printed before having to go through this miserable process again . Go ahead , turn off every automatic feature and detection feature there is , it does n't help.Then one of the minuscule half-dozen print cartridges will become empty and the printer will refuse to print anything until it 's replaced . I 'm often not sure how the [ obscure , seldom-used ] color cartridge became empty as what I was printing did n't use that color . Sometimes I come to use the printer and will find a color cartridge has supposedly gone empty while sitting doing nothing . This printer is annoying and hideously expensive to run.On the plus side , once you do get the wretched thing to grace you with the boon of an actually printed page , the quality is gorgeous . The printing speed is very fast , but that 's irrelevant because of how much time it takes to get to the fast printing . Genuine speed to get to the finished product makes this the slowest printer I 've ever had.This does n't even get us to the scanner , which is its own tangle of `` helpful '' features.Horrid , horrid , horrid printer .	-1
I 've had this about a year . On paper the features looks great . When the machine is in a good mood it prints and copies ok.However , the printer frequently misreads the ink cartridge level as `` Low '' and then COMPLETELY QUITS WORKING , even with a new ink cartridge . The only way to get around it is to do some voodoo like Reset process that I found online ( see below ) . It is extremely frustrating and I would not recommend it to anyone.How to reset Canon MX310 printer low ink signal1 . Power off the printer.2 . Holding the stop/reset button , press and hold power button also . Hold both buttons together for 5 secs.3 . Still holding the power button , release the stop/reset buton , then press the stop/reset button twice.4 . Release power button ( the screen should now say 'Service Mode ' ) .5 . Wait until the power button lights steady green , then press the stop/reset button three times with a 3 sec space between each press . On the 3rd press the indicator should turn steady orange.6 . Press the power button once , ( the orange light should go off ) .7 . Open the printer and remove both cartridges . Wait for 10 seconds . Replace the cartridges and close printer . Wait for 30 seconds.8 . Press the power button , and wait until printer has shut down.9 . Press power button to power up . The printer will feed one piece of paper , then ask you to set the language.10 . The page counter is now reset ! Enjoy .	-1
Sounded good , before I tried it myself . First of all , the `` Quick Start '' guide is 119 pages long . That ought to tell you something right there -- Is n't a `` Quick Start '' guide usually 1 or 2 pages long ? I 'm not finding this to be an even remotely intuitive device . I my humble opinion , this is the most complicated multi-function unit I have ever encountered . The only thing I can get it to do easily is print . The Automatic Doc Feeder works ... sometimes ... for reasons which escape me . I tried to get it to feed a doc for scanning , it would n't do it . However , it DID feed a doc for faxing.With regard to fax/phone/ans device coordination , not being able to turn off the ringer and not being able to stop the thing from interrupting incoming messages with fax beeping is really annoying . It made so much noise during recorded messages , I could hardly hear what was being said . I finally created a bypass phone line that I can just unplug when not in use . But I 've never had this problem with any other fax machine . With regard to the inability to turn off the ringer , apparently this is not a setting that you can change . You can only make the ringer loud or normal . You ca n't turn it off.When I tried clicking on `` Help '' for the multitudinous questions I had for how in the world to run this thing , an error message came up indicating there is no help for this model . ( Go figure ... ) I 'm concerned about the comments about it being an ink hog . But I have n't had it long enough to evaluate that , and if things continue as they have been , I probably wo n't have it long enough to know.My last HP died prematurely . However , out of the box , it was a breeze compared to this machine . I 'm disappointed . The price is great . But I guess you get what you pay for , as the saying goes ... This reminds me of the 70 's and early 80 's when you had to be a rocket scientist to run a computer . I guess I 'm not one of those .	-1
I bought this printer in April of '08 . It died today Oct.17 , 2008 . I 'd be much more upset if it was my only printer . Have not been happy from beginning because of problems with paper handling . Must use rear feed for anything other than 20 # paper . Rear feed hard to use and inadequate paper guide leads to many misfeeds . Gave up on using front tray after a month because it kept jamming with it 's limited use . Today I got messages there was a paper jam when there was n't . Mechanisms began to sound horrible and print awful , then my paper did jam and wo n't clear.A shocker a month ago : ran out of ink in one color . the printer then refused to do any printing at all and would n't even let me scan or fax when my task did n't need to use any ink.I 'm done with it . I do n't even want an exchange if they offered it . I 'm going back to HP and Brother .	-1

These were used with adults and children and there was a problem with the ends of the lanyard pulling through and tearing the pocket . We went back to using the clip-on ones . ( You can pull the lanyard through and make a small knot between the metal piece and the pocket . This helps . )	-1

I bought the Epson V500 Perfection scanner because of Epson 's supposed quality . The unit is built well enough ( except for the film/slide holders ) and , at first blush , works well enough . However , when scanning color film negatives , selecting more than one `` Adjustments '' results in an error message , `` Unable to write to file '' and the software shuts down . I do n't care about the `` Adjustments '' because I use Photoshop to process my photos . But in trying to scan at 48 bit , the same message pops up . Scanning anything over 300 dpi is excruciatingly slow . I use the scanner mostly as a copying machine so no big deal . But if you intend to use it to scan film or slides and you do n't use Photoshop , beware ! Maybe that 's why they include Adobe Photoshop Elements as part of the deal . Except for the fact that I do n't expect much from my Epson V500 scanner , I 'd send it back in a minute and go back to my trusty HP scanner ! Buyer beware . I am using it with Windows XP and have not checked to see if it works any better on my wife 's Windows 7 computer . But this is most likely the last Epson product I 'll ever purchase .	-1
I have had spotty success with Epson products in the past , but in researching a new scanner , most of the reviews had about the same amount of negatives and positives , so it was a tossup for me.I chose this scanner because it had the highest dpi resolution among the similarly priced scanners . It looked good out of the box , and I made sure to go to Epson 's website and download their latest driver per their instructions there . The scanner was easy to hook up and started up just fine . I was expecting something flimsy , but it seemed solidly made . I made one scan that came out fine , and then the problems started.I got a flashing error light on the unit itself , and the software kept telling me either that the scanner was n't hooked up properly , or that the `` carriage '' ( whatever that is ) was not hooked up right . I spent about a half an hour unplugging the unit , uninstalling and re-installing the driver , re-plugging the unit in , and re-starting my Mac before I could get it to work again.In total , I was able to get 4 scans out of this unit . The orange error light kept re-occurring , and my frustration mounted with every unplug/re-start/re-plug/re-install/etc . I contacted Epson ( after slogging through their horrible and vague knowledgebase , what is it with these companies ? ) and they informed me that it would need service . I 'm sorry , but a brand-new scanner should work properly right out of the box and not need immediate service . I have returned it with Amazon 's great return policy.To give Epson the benefit of the doubt , the Amazon box that arrived at my doorstep looked like it had endured some abuse , so the scanner may have been damaged or mis-calibrated or something by poor handling.I have decided to try a Canon next time . ( though I 've had spotty experiences with them in the past , also . )	-1
With the included software , this scanner is almost useless . Regardless of how you set the clunky driver software , the scans come out so fuzzy you 'll think it 's out of focus or smothered in vaseline . The bottom of the scan glass is cloudy as the head passes over it.Oddly if you use VueScan , you 'll find that the scans are far sharper -- not great , but far sharper , even without an unsharp mask / sharpening applied.The scanner is extremely fast and the physical body is well designed . Using the multiple page PDF option requires clicking two buttons on the software , not the body of the scanner , for each additional page ( why not one button ? why not a button on the scanner body ? ) .You can save your settings but you ca n't assign a name to the saved settings.The Mac software is PPC based so it wo n't work in Leopard . A very limited subset of features is available via Image Capture and that appears to be Epson 's sole solution.Canon 's looking very attractive . I bought this based on other reviews at Amazon and wish I 'd returned it earlier .	-1
Well , I 've spent over 2 hours trying to install the scanner software on my PC running Vista Ultimate , and so far have not succeeded . The basic software to run the scanner wo n't start , so I am currently dead in the water.Hopefully , I 'll get this worked out and be able to update this review with scanner performance details.Also , while the product description for this scanner says that it is designed and optimized for Windows Vista , the included version of Photoshop Elements software is version 4.0 , released in 2005 . The current version of Photoshop Elements is 6.0 . Version 4.0 seems to open and may function somewhat in Vista , but it is not supported for Vista , and you do get a `` known compatibility issues exist with this software '' warning when you launch it .	-1
NOTE : this review is for ink cartridges purchased from VIVAMART ( and Fulfilled by Amazon ) ... and the cartridges received DO NOT look like the ones in the images show on Amazon ! So far we 've only tried the CYAN and YELLOW cartridges.The CYAN color is good , matches the Brother one in color ( and matches the Amazon Basics cartridge also ) .HOWEVER , the YELLOW cartridges were another story . One cartridge has ink in it but wo n't print a drop . The 2nd YELLOW cartridge sometimes prints and sometimes not . When it does print , the yellow sometimes carries a green tint . NOT GOOD ! So now I have to go hunt down replacement yellow cartridges.I still have not yet to try the MAGENTA or BLACK cartridges , as my printer does n't require them to be changed yet . So the review on those are still pending .	-1
had to send it back . printer wont recognize cartridge . this is the problem with the cheaper refilled ink . better off with manufacturer 's brand . no problems ever .	-1
I have an all-in-one brother laser printer that is black and white and I love it , so when my 10 year old HP color laser printer gave up the ghost , I thought I would try this one . Overall ... it was n't the best purchase.PROS1- Extremely easy setup . I set it up to work off of my network print server , as well as wirelessly within about 5 minutes . I was then able to install and setup 2 Mac computers and 3 PC computers within 20 minutes . All worked fine and printed without issue to the printer.2- Relatively quiet compared to my old HP.3- Print speed4- PriceCONS1- Really , the only problem I found with it was the print quality when printing in color . I was so disappointed . Like I said , I switched from a 10 year-old HP color laser . The colors on my HP were vibrant and true to what my photographs showed . The colors on this printer 's ( Brother MFC-9840CDW ) print-out were horribly washed out and almost made it look like the photographs were actually faded.Although the price of the printer was excellent , I am going to return mine because of the color print quality . If you do n't care about that , this printer is great in every other way . However , if you are looking for vibrant , true colors , like your photographs show ... then I would go with a different printer .	-1

I know the reviews on this machine are mixed . But there were enough good reviews that seemed to indicate a good number of people were happy with some of the features I was looking for . I have the previous model . It 's adequate . So I thought I 'd give this one a try . Then I got it and set it up ... If anyone out there knows of an answering machine with really good sound quality , I be grateful if you 'd make a comment with that information in it.These are the Pros and Cons for me : Pros : Fairly easy to set upSimple to operateAbout 40 min . recording time.Cons : The quality of the sound is even worse than the previous model . It 's very tinny and distorted . Also , when I recorded my outgoing message , there is an echo on my voice ! What 's with that ? Messages left for me have even more of an echo on them . You notice it more because it 's louder and the echo is delayed more than with my outgoing message.The phone cord is hardwired and too short . I have no idea what the logic is behind hardwiring the phone cord . I 'd like to be able to replace the cord if it fails or , as in my case , I would like to use a longer cord . I know I can buy an adapter an add a cord , buy why is this even necessary ? If you turn it off , it turns itself back on after 10 rings and answers . If I turn it off , I want it to stay off.It 's in expensive and you get what you pay for .	-1
I 've been using HP printers for forever and bought a Lexmark for the first time . I hate it and now find that the black ink only lasted 1 month ! ! ! ! Hp is MUCH better ! ! Wish I never bought the d**m thing ! I 'm going back to HP . I ca n't afford these prices for one month 's ink !	-1
I purchased these cartridges prior to running out of ink , so I had no need to open them right away . I installed the black cartridge a few days after receiving it , but it was several weeks before I needed to open and use the color cartridge . Although it looked fine , upon installation , my printer displayed the message that this was not the correct cartridge for my model . It is exactly the same as the cartridge I just removed , so I know that is n't true . I put the old one back in - no problems . I put the new one back in , and get the same message . The cartridge is useless to me . Because my `` return window '' had expired , I ca n't get a full refund . Very annoying , since people tend to buy cartridges in bulk and open them as needed - not necessarily right away . I wo n't order these through Amazon again because of their return policy on this type of item . Go to Staples or Office Depot - at least you can return a defective product !	-1
As for the ink cartridges in general , there 's not a lot to say - they are ink cartridges and they work just fine when they are not defective.That said I , like several others here , received a defective black ink cartridge . I figured out the problem - the black ones do n't have the little plastic tray on them that they are supposed to have , inside the foil packaging . That led me to the obvious reality that some were improperly packed from the manufacturer , and the lack of the plastic tray on the cartridge allowed some to be punctured at some point.I know this because I did notice a little puncture mark on the foil package of the black cartridge . I opened it carefully to find that ink had leaked out within the foil packaging . If the plastic tray had been there it would mostly likely not have happened.Amazon is the best and they replaced my order immediately . I received another set that was just fine , but I think that was a stroke of luck for me because the black cartridge in the new set did n't have the plastic tray either . So , I can only figure that it 's a hit & miss deal until they no longer have the ones that were improperly packaged by the manufacturer .	-1
I ordered this pack since it said it would work in my Lexmark X7675 printer . Well it turns out that yes the color 43 will fit it but the 44 does not it will not lock in the proper position . The interesting thing is the box says it also fits the X7675.I am sending this back to Amazon .	-1
I was interested in this scanner purely because it 's a cheap tabloid scanner . It is indeed a very cheap construction , but I did know it from the price , and the build quality may be ok for the price range.The problem is that the Mac OS driver works only with Photoshop and NOT ANY OTHER program I tried , including standard Image Capture and TWAIN applications . What 's worse , this scanner does not work with VueScan on Mac OS X and its developer Ed Hamrick confirmed this . I 've also tried this scanner and a range of softwares on Leopard and Snow Leopard with no luck except for recent versions of Photoshop.Using Photoshop , this scanner gives very slow scans and very lousy image quality . Documents and line drawings in color will show fuzzy rainbow edges . The image quality may be acceptable for low quality document uses , but the scanner is way too slow for that application.In short , it is nice to have an option for tabloid scanner in this price range , but the usability of this product is quite limited . I think occasional , low volume , low quality demand users may be happy with it , as long as they are willing to use Windows platform or Photoshop just for scanning .	-1
I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome , too many years ( 30+ ) of typing and pushing a mouse around , I guess . As such , I can really tell when a product designed to help CTS really helps , and this does not . It is plain too hard . It does position my hands a bit better than resting them on the desk , but with an Apple Aluminum Keyboard ( which is really thin ) this just forces me to hold my hands up putting more strain on my wrists . I compared it to an old 3M Gel mouse pad that I have , it it is much firmer , might as well just have a piece of wood as a matter of fact . Believe it or not , this is also not wide enough for me as it leaves little available room ( about 6 '' wide ) as a mousing surface .	-1
only .5 '' high not 1 '' other than obvious lack of function due to height , the material is good , no leaks , does not stiffen up over time , no bad smellInnovera is a better brand	-1
I switched from my previous wrist rest ( 3M Office Gel Wrist Rest for Keyboards ) to this one for a few weeks and my wrists and fingers had never been in so much pain.I am on the computer for 8-9 hours a day during the week . At first , I thought this would be comfortable since it was a bit firmer than my previous one . I said to myself , `` hey , more support , right ? '' Boy was I wrong . I had to switch back to my old wrist rest.If you prefer a firmer rest wrist , then give this one a try . It definitely was n't for me . It was made well , but was not soft enough in my opinion .	-1
Before I mention the things that could be improved upon , here are the things I like about this wrist rest : it 's about the right height for my keyboard , it has about the right `` firmness , '' it does n't get hot after having your hands / wrist on it for an extended period of time , and the drop of coffee I spilled on it wiped right up with no staining.All of this could be improved if the manufacturer did just a few things . First , it is way too long as I prefer to have these things about the same length as my keyboard . They are trying to accomodate a mouse in addition to the keyboard which is a nice thing , but I 'm not one of those users who has the mouse immediately next to my keyboard - it is several inches away and , as a result , this extra length just gets in the way of everything else that is piled on my desk.My main complaint about this wrist rest , however , is it is not wide enough . I do n't think I have abnormally large hands ( I do n't ) , but pulling out my ruler I have the edge of the wrist rest one inch away from the edge of the end of the keyboard in order for my wrist to rest on the pad and have my fingers be in the approximate middle of the keyboard.My tendons hurt more after using this one than not using one at all . I do n't think this wrist rest was designed to be used by most men . For the price of this one , you should be able to find one that feels comfortable .	-1
I read many of the countless reviews across the internet on this item . Most loved it . I was aware that a small but consistent minority mentioned this thing is not gel at all and is about as hard as wood . Well , they were correct.The good - Not much good about it , except the shape and width are great for my mouse/mouse pad set up . The curved part fits into the small curve of my mouse pad and the angles are good for my desk . It also stays put - no sliding around . That 's where the good ends though sadly ... The bad - This thing is as hard as a piece of wood . I have another gel wrist rest for my keyboard - it 's squishy and conforms to my hands while also providing enough stability too . This thing provides no conformity to my hand nor is it 'gel like ' at all . Also , as others have pointed out , the covering is a sweat factory and living in the desert , that stinks . I have n't had my hand stick to it so badly that it lifted it up unlike other reviewers , but I could see it happening . This thing does n't make my wrist feel any better and I can see pain if I used it long term . Thankfully , I have a different brand already on order so this thing wo n't be in my life much longer .	-1
At first I loved this . It felt reasonably comfortable and looked nice . It is VERY firm however , and does n't feel cushioned at all -- nothing like other gel products I 've seen . But after a few weeks of use , I noticed pain in my wrist , which I 'd never had before . Since the only thing about my office setup that had changed was this rest , it seemed the most likely culprit . I stopped using it , and within a couple of days the pain disappeared . It 's now serving as a paperweight . I ca n't recommend it as a wrist rest .	-1
FYI This arrived with a WARNING label on the package . & # 34 ; WARNING : This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. & # 34 ; When are corporations going to stop manufacturing items that are known causes of cancer ? Amazon was excellent about letting me return the item , which I immediately did . I am going to reread the product description , but I certainly did not notice any mention of any warnings when I purchased it .	-1
I am not a big fan of this staple remover.It did not come with any instructions and you really wouldn & # 8217 ; t expect to need any I guess but when I and several members of my family tried to use it all that happened was that the staples were literally torn out of the pages . It was difficult to use and not very successful.Perhaps we were using it wrong but without instructions we were left to our own devices and the outcome wasn & # 8217 ; t very pretty .	-1
I read the box , there were NO instructions , and it did n't work for me unless I handled the staple ( the one to be removed ) by holding it and then trying to push the staple remover into position , and then squeezing the handle to remove the staple . I tested this by stapling paper - just one page of paper - and it was a chore to remove the staples . I do n't like it.I 'll stick with the old-fashioned staple remover .	-1
I used to have one of those simple pinch-type staple removers , must have lost it . So I was excited to give this a try , but it 's just poorly designed . It 's heavy-duty and well-made but when you set it flat on the work surface to try and remove a staple , it slides all over the desk ! When you hold it in mid-air , it does n't grip the staple ! Add to that that I have hands on the larger side and STILL the handle is difficult to grasp firmly . Ca n't really recommend this at all .	-1
I find this staple remover difficult to use . Perhaps my is defective since so many other people say how well it works . I have trouble getting the tip under the staple . Once it is under the staple when I squeeze the handle the paper around the staple is torn and crumpled as the staple is removed . It works better on thick packets of stapled paper .	-1
I need to be able to extract truly heavy duty staples that are used to secure 50+ pages . This one could n't do it . Perhaps it is not realistic to expect it for such an application but it is titled & # 34 ; Heavy Duty Staple Remover & # 34 ; .	-1
Easy-Glide ! Easy-Glide Ink System ! Revolutionary right ? No it 's not . I got excited for no reason.Some other reviewers mentioned this easy glide pen being an alternative to the Pilot G-2 Gel Ink Pen ... No , its performance is n't remotely close to a gel pen.As a ballpoint pen , it 's about average . 1-Star for average ? Yes , it got my hopes up with Easy-Glide this , Easy-Glide that , and it ended up being bogus.With other manufacturers marketing their smooth-flowing ballpoint inks , e.g . Paper Mate with InkJoy ( No experience with it ) , King Uni-Ball with the Jetstream . I expected something similar to the Jetstream . A pen that produces distinct , vibrant lines with smooth flowing ink.The marks this pen makes are n't vibrant and are n't smooth flowing.I will give it that its ink is darker than normal BIC pens . But I have trouble finding a pen that is not darker and more vibrant than the dull , gray ink of BIC 's standard line of ballpoint pens.The ink is certainly darker , but the ink flow is the problem . As I write , I get significant sections of letters that do n't have ink . The ink fades in and out . The ink needs to be `` jump started '' every time it touches the paper to get a dark continuous line . Writing fast always breaks up the ink flow . This is a good pen for you if you write LARGE , in CURSIVE , and very SLOWLY.Ballpoint pens by Cello ( E.g . Cello Silke/Smooth | INC Style Glides , can be found branded as an Off Dpt pen ) and the INC Forma , perform a bit better than this pen . A bit . They do n't get close to the experience of Uni-Ball/Mitsubishi Pencil Co. 's Jetstream hybrid ink ( vibrant lines , smooth flow , AND quick drying ) , but they 're better than the average lot . I also really like BAZIC 's 'Oil Gel ' pens ( low-cost pens , vibrant and smooth flowing ink , but average dry time ) found in bargain/dollar stores.Now , WTF is Easy-Glide ? The package cites patent number 6797748 B2 . Some idea taken from printer ink technology which adds ( isocyanate free ! ) polyurethane resin to ink that is supposed to produce an ink vaguely described as `` well performing . '' It 's described as smooth writing and non-seepage . BIC obviously needs to re-evaluate how they quantify `` smooth writing . '' Smooth writing , as in lower friction and lower vibration , provided by improved ink lubricity and higher shear strength ( and larger nib ) , at the expense of continuous ink flow is not a good direction to head towards.At least I found out ( from reading ink ingredients ) that sniffing undried ballpoint ink fumes is n't good for you.Update : Had some more time with this pen . No , it is n't an average pen . It is very much below average . Your standard no names are better . Normal BICs do n't have as bad of a skipping problem that this `` easy-glide '' pen has . I would rather use the standard BICs with dull ink instead of the revolutionary skip-tronic technology in these pens.. I do n't see myself ever picking up this pen if there is another pen around. -- -Update 2 : Very nice of readers to thumb down as not helpful without explaining why this is not helpful.Perhaps all you care about is whether or not the pen can write , that it can lay down ink in some fashion . ( In that case , why are you reading reviews ? Pick up any generic pen . ) The reason why I picked up a few packs of these pens was because of a favorable review comparing the writing ability to a Pilot G2 , which this thing 's writing experience is n't anything close to , it 's the complete opposite . The ink does n't flow well enough on first contact . The ink fades in and out ( you get white blanks , missing sections in letters when writing fast ) .I went into the store and picked up just this item and was looking for only this item . That 's how much effort I put , and I had high expectation , looking for some sort of holy grail of a pen that was dirt cheap and wrote as well as the higher end pens . I imagined the complete BS `` easy glide system '' being reminiscent of Hybrid ink tech that you 'd find in pens by Uni-ball , Pilot , and Zebra . This is n't anything close , it 's worse than most generic ballpoints in my opinion.If you want a decent writing `` ballpoint '' pen , head straight to the Uniball Jetstream , Pilot Acroball , the Pentel Vicuna , the Zebra Surari . Those are the types of pens you want to write with extensively and keep . This BIC with `` easy glide '' is the kind of pen you give away and throw away .	-1
These are so thin . I bought these because the reviewes here said that they are bold , not fine , and that the name is confusing.I was very happy to get me some bold point pens in all colors of the rainbow , but these are super fine , barely there , thin-thin-thin pens . I did not like them at all .	-1
The product box boasts a 90 % larger tab area . I 've attached a picture so you can see the difference in tabs compared to a standard file folder.Now here 's the fatal flaw ... when you put standard 8 1/2 x 11 paper inside the folder , the tab gets covered up and you are left with the same visual area as a traditional file folder . See attached picture.The colors are nice but what appears to be orange in the photo is really a dark manilla color.The folders are nice overall but I would n't recommend them based on the larger tab size alone because for my use they are n't that helpful because I have to move the paper inside to see the bottom half of the tab .	-1
Why improve the tape roll with something lame ? That should have been the question someone asked when this product was designed . This thing ran out of tape in 2 seconds and it cumbersome and awkward . I would not recommend it at all . Zero stars .	-1
No amount of pushing or prying with a thin , sturdy object would get the tape compartment open , and I eventually decided it was n't worth losing a finger jumst to have a two inch piece of tape pop out of the dispenser . It is n't much smaller than a roll of tape on a plastic dispenser , with the advantage that you can strap it over your fingers , but the disadvantage that you ca n't size the tape as needed . Is this really an improvement ? Perhaps it 's more environmentally friendly over the long run , but only if it works.Back to the drawing board , Scotch !	-1
This is a very expensive way to dispense tape . I 'm sorry . I just cant get on board with this product . You look like a moron wearing this and refills are increadibly difficult to find.Scotch Pop-Up Tape Strips 90M-12PK ( Price for 1,800 inches . ) Once you do find them , you will need to secure an FHA loan to morgage your litter of kittens to purchase it . ( I assume you own a lot of cats if you own this . ) In all seriousness , just buy a heavily weighted tape dispenser such asScotch Deluxe Desktop Tape Dispenser , C-40 , Black , for 1 Inch Core Tapes . Refills are easily obtained and are very cheap.Scotch Magic Tape 3/4 in x 1000 in , 10-Count Package ( Price for 10,000 inches . ) This dispenser is heavily weighted so you can easily pull tape with one hand and you can even select the proper length of tape.Sorry folks . I just did n't like this product . It is not a better mousetrap .	-1
This item is advertised as the `` ultimate '' in tape delivery , and the blurb suggests that you do n't have to go looking for tape because it `` stays with you '' , but unless the user is going to wear this handband 24/7 , this does n't make a lot of sense.If , when you gift wrap , you always use two-inch lengths of tape ( and I do n't ) , you still must consider if having these two-inch lengths pre-cut for your convenience is really worth a price which is double that of an ordinary roll of Scotch tape which has a cutter on its dispenser . In addition , if this is your Scotch tape of choice , you will need to have a backup package or three , because 75 small pieces of tape are not going to go far in wrapping a pile of gifts.We have all purchsed off-brand tape , and as a result wasted time trying to find the end which is taped to the roll . But the regular roll of Scotch tape , packaged in a dispenser , is all you need for convenient gift wrapping , and is half the price .	-1
The Scotch PopUp tape dispense is a great idea - instead of an endless roll of tape that you have to measure and use two hands to control , you strap this device to one hand and use the other to pull out pre-measured lengths of tape . This seems perfectly-designed for wrapping Christmas gifts that are a complex shape , where the paper needs one hand to hold it down . It worked reasonably well for me in that respect , especially for very large gifts where the ability to stabilize the package on the table was critical . However , while the strap that holds the tape in place is adjustable , it is not really made for large hands . I am a big guy , with large hands , and the strap became painful after only about 10 minutes of use . I had to take it off after only about 4 packages were done , and went back to a standard tape dispenser for the other 20+ packages.If you are a woman or a man with smaller hands , do not hesitate to buy it . But if you have larger meathooks like me , probably best to stick with a more traditional solution .	-1
This dispenser works as intended , but gets in the way during use , requires product-specific refills , and is only a little more effective than a desktop tape dispenser.I used this dispenser wrapping some of my this season 's gifts , and found it got in the way while worn on my hand or knuckles ( as recommended ) -- I was n't able to manipulate the partially-wrapped gifts very well one-handed . I have average-sized male hands , and the strap is tight across my hand . I was able to wear it on my wrist a little more comfortably , but found the convenience not much different than having a more versatile desktop tape dispenser nearby.When I put the unit down , it often ended up with the `` wrong '' side down , causing the tape poking out to stick to the dispenser itself.While I 'm usually a gadget-freak , this unit is a little too specific without adding much function . Unless you work at a gift-wrapping station , not recommended .	-1
I never got the hang of this product . with the loading and fitting around my hand comfortably , I could 've been done with the wrapping by then .	-1
This little gadget is `` okay '' but I am puzzled by the need for it . I have never found a regular tape dispenser to be overly difficult to use so I fail to understand why paying 5 times as much to have a tape dispenser with pre-cut tape attached to my wrist is very beneficial . Not only do you pay substantially more for this method , you are forced to use a set size of tape ( which , for me , was quite a bit larger than I needed in most cases ) ; Yes , you could cut the tape sheet in half but doing so really defeats the purpose of this gadget ( which was designed to simplify things and by cutting the pre-cut strips now requires more work than the traditional tape dispenser ) .The premium you are paying for this device is not worth it . I gave it 2 stars because it is Scotch tape which is good tape but I recommend saving your money and sticking with traditional means of dispensing tape ; it really is n't that complicated .	-1
Shortest review I 've probably ever written : Installed software , hooked up scanner , and attempted to use . Could n't save or view scans . Received error message . No help on Fujitsu website . None , nada , niente , zip , zero , zilch . Attempted fixes mentioned on other websites . Still would n't work . This piece-of-crap scanner is going to be returned tomorrow .	-1
I purchased this No Soliciting sign after getting one too many magazine sales people at my front door . It arrived quickly and I was pleased with the appearance given the low price . It comes with two-sided tape and little grooves on the back where you can line up the tape , making it easy to mount . While this sort of thing is n't going to be super-attractive , overall I thought it looked fine on my front door.Unfortunately , after only one day on the door the sign melted . Seriously , just the heat from sunlight on the door destroyed this sign in a single day ! This was July in Maryland - it did n't even reach the 100 degree mark . I 'm not sure if my sign was some sort of lemon or if they simply ca n't withstand direct sun but regardless this product did not meet my needs.I will be returning it immediately , but I would still recommend it for applications where it was n't going to be in direct sun because it looks decent .	-1
I bought the Powershred 99Ci based on its impressive specifications and features , and also because of the many positive reviews it had received online from other customers . However , I 'm not happy with this product . The problems I encountered with the use of this shredder are as follow : The 99Ci does not shred junk mail , i.e. , unopened envelopes that contain more than 3 or 4 sheets of paper . The machine is too sensitive in that it stops shredding when the paper bin is only half full , requiring frequent emptying of the bucket , which is a nuisance . The 99Ci is advertised as having the capability to shred up to 17 sheets of paper at a time , but in my experience , sometimes it does and sometimes it does n't ; and when it does , it struggles to get the job done . I have n't had a chance to test the machine 's cool-down period that would be required after 25 minutes of continuous use , and therefore can not provide any useful comment about that particular function . In a nutshell , the 99Ci that I received and have used does not justify its high price . The manufacturer should either improve this product , carefully check them all before they leave the assembly line , or lower the unit cost .	-1
Just like this product 's matching keyboard wrist rest ( 3M ( TM ) Wrist Rest for Keyboard , Antimicrobial , Gel , Large Size , Black ) , I found the wrist rest on this mouse mad way too hard.While both products appear to be well made , the padding on them are just not soft enough for me . I am on the computer for 8-9 hours a day and my wrists and fingers were in a lot of pain since switching over to these products.I do like the gliding surface on this pad though . My mouse glides smoothly and response is great . But both sides of the pad have been curled up slightly since I received the product several weeks ago and has yet to flatten out completely.I went back to using myBelkin F8E262-BLK WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad ( Black ) instead . It is much softer , even though I do n't like the actual mouse pad surface as much as the one on this product .	-1
This does not work with Mac OS 10.5.5 . You need to update the drivers and then the application , or is it the other way around ? When you need the application , they require the serial number which then says you do n't have the the right number ( which it was ) . You then call and wait 30 minutes to be told you need wait another unannounced time to talk to the Mac department , which never did answer . I shoved it back in the box after 5 hours of trying to get to run and sent it back to the dealer . Brother has some very serious customer service problems as well as hardware and software issues . When the CSR hang up on you , you know you 've bought the wrong item ! This is a problem device and they even ask you if it 's a QL-570 , indicating to me , that they have many issues and complaints with it . Stay away is my advice , it 's not a good thing !	-1
This is suppose to assist you in making a smaller box . This does a poor job it and all it does is make some perforations on where you want the new box to fold so you still need a box cutter to finish the job . I find it easier to just use a scissor to cut the corners and then use a box cutter to score the inside of the box . Better yet I use a skil 2352 multi cutter instead of scissors .	-1
This unit is not heavy duty enough , nor hot enough to seal any more than a page or two . Try to seal more , and you will get areas that do not seal the adhesive , resulting in white splotches on your finished project .	-1
I purchased this quite awhile back but never got around to using it . I plugged it in for the first time today . It started to heat up but turned off after a couple of minutes . Tried letting it cool back down , moving outlets , etc . but nothing works.Unmitigated junk..	-1
I hate licking envelopes and prefer using security ones to protect confidential information from prying eyes , so I thought I would really like these . However , the security markings are poorly done and information is easily read when holding the envelopes up to a light . The tamper portion works as expected for the most part , but what good does it really do if the contents can be read without doing anything to the envelope itself ? For the price and quantity you receive in combination with these issues , the envelopes are not worth it . A minor complaint but frustrating nonetheless - the seal on the box itself was so overdone that I had to tear the box open , so I could not use it to store the envelopes any longer .	-1
Or maybe I received a defective batch of enveloopes to test ? The envelopes are nice , white , sturdy # 10 Security envelopes . They are self stick , with a flap that covers the self-sticky part until you are ready to use it -- however , in most cases the flap was slightly stuck to the sticky part that it was trying to protect . However , once I got past that hurdle , the envelope sealed VERY securely.Now , to test this Reveal-N-Seal feature , I left the sealed envelopes for a few days -- then I opened them by trying to gently undo the sealed flap -- they do n't open very easily -- which is nice . The strong glue ensures that it is NOT easy to unseal the whole envelope -- but NOWHERE did I see those red letters ! ! All I got for my efforts were security envelopes that had their flaps torn open ... .THAT of course is an indicator of a `` security breach '' but ... red letters ? Not a one .	-1
These `` reveal-n-seal '' envelopes are convenient , but not especially secure . In fact , they may be less secure than common envelopes.Good self-sealing no-lick envelopes use a special adhesive on each of the two parts to be sealed together , with that adhesive substance ( actually a `` cohesive '' substance to be scientifically accurate ) only sticking to its counterpart on the other side , but not sticking to bare paper or fingers . I have seen samples of such things and they work extremely well , but they were kind of expensive.The `` Quality Park '' version is just bare paper on the flap , and gummy stuff on the bottom . It is not any more sticky than any other stick-on formula , and I am able to carefully pull it apart again . It does separate perfectly , but with care I am able to re-open the envelope and re-seal it so that it is not noticeable.There are several little cuts in the flap of the envelope which make it difficult to pull apart without ripping ( the same strategy as price stickers ) , but it only requires a little care to avoid that . Rather than being an added security feature , those cuts only partly make up for the non-permanent sticking.The security print is also not the best . Semi-random swirly patterns work best to obscure text viewing through envelopes , but Quality Park uses a grid-like pattern of dots , which is actually easy to ignore in order to view envelope contents.They work well enough to use for most purposes , and wo n't come apart by accident or even rough mail handling . They also are more convenient than licking envelopes , so they are handy if you find yourself stuck with a sudden need to mail a bunch of stuff and do n't already have a professional service in place . But the product description emphasizes security , and in that regard these are not very good .	-1
As a standard envelope , this works well . The self adhesive is sticky enough and is nice to not have a strip of paper to throw away when sealing the envelope . It 's a pretty thin strip of adhesive , so I still put a piece of tape on the flap , not to prevent tampering per se , but just to make sure that it does n't accidentally get ripped open while in transit.So , I put a standard bank check in the envelope and held it up to my little halogen desk lamp . VIOLA ! I can still read my account number quite well . Well , that was disappointing ! So I then took an old lick-style security envelope and the check account number was much harder to make out.Oh well , I had high hopes for this , but I would not mail just a check in this envelope by itself . Wrap the check in something else , like extra paper or discarded coupons to obscure the account number . Since security is supposed to be such a big feature of this envelope , I can not recommend it on that premise . As a regular envelope it 's fine .	-1
Despite claims to the contrary , these envelopes do not appear to be tamper proof.I test sealed , then opened , one of the envelopes and no indications appeared that the envelope had been opened . The box that these envelopes comes in does not mention tamper-proof features , so perhaps the Amazon item description is incorrect.The glue on these appears strong and the printing on the inside successfully conceals content . I found the paper weight to be on the light side , but was pleased that there were no tear-off strips to reveal the glue . The bottom flap just lifts up to reveal it.If security is a major concern for you , you may want to find envelopes that have more tamper-evident features .	-1
The two main draws of this envelope from it 's description are the easy seal ( `` Reveal-N-Seal '' ) patented technology , and the blue patterning on the inside of the envelope to obscure what 's inside . Unfortunately neither works well . The reveal-n-seal is a strip in the middle to top third of the envelope that you fold up to reveal the adhesive . It 's better than licking the glue on an envelope . But the standard type of adhesive where you peel away the waxy paper strip on the top flap is easiest , simplest , and works best . In short , the reveal-n-seal technology ( patented ) is un-necessary and tries too hard . It 's an envelope ! Worse , the blue patterning inside wo n't completely conceal what 's inside . I tested it by placing a check inside and you could tell what was in there . Not recommended .	-1
These envelopes were supposed to show a red warning if they had been opened . I tried several methods of opening including steam and never saw a red message . Other than that , the real value of these envelopes is the strength of the glue placed on the flap . It makes it impossible to open the envelope without significantly damaging it . So , the red warning is really an unecessary gimmick . They are also printed in blue on the inside which makes it virtually impossible to read any of the information inside through the envelope . Lasltly , they are very expensive at over $ 5.00 for forty envelopes . You can get cardboard mailers with even stronger glue for not much more than that price , though the postage might cost you more . If you rarely have something that requires special security I would keep a few cardboard mailers around the house or send it by UPS or FedEx and get tracking number and a receipt . Use of the above envelopes will not ever guarantee that it gets there or somebody saying I opened it by mistake . If you send a lot of mail where it is important that nobody reads it but the addressee , then you are probably in a business that can get a better volume price on the above envelopes or something similar . In any case , I would bet that the price of these envelopes will come down because of limited demand .	-1
As others have already said this is not a very good security envelope.To test it I placed a lone check inside it and held it to the light.I literally was able to read the account number through the envelope.I then took a cheap envelope I bought prior and did the same test.Although I could see it was a check I could not make out the account # due to the security markings on the inside of the envelope.The defect is in the blue security markings . They are not designed to completely block someone from seeing through the envelope.If you use the envelope with something personal inside use another sheet of paper to help block out the personal info.I would never buy these . I will use them with all things not of a personal nature .	-1
These are standard # 10 envelopes with a security background inside so that contents can not be read through the envelope . The primary feature that distinguishes this product is that these envelopes are tamper-proof so that you know the envelope was not opened since it was initially sealed . The way this is achieved is that there are perforations along the edge where the flap closes . If anyone tries to carefully open the flap , they likely will tear one of the perforations , which rips apart the entire envelope.Now why am I rating this 2-stars ? Because in reality , the so-called `` tamper-proof '' features can be easily defeated . If someone really really wants to intercept your mailing , they can easily come up with other ways to do that without detection . For one , they can easily get another envelope ( after all , if you can buy it here on Amazon , I 'm sure they can too ) . Also , if someone is extremely careful , they can easily open up the envelope without tearing it ( although this would require extreme carefulness and patience ) . I do n't see the need to pay a few extra bucks for these envelopes as opposed to a standard envelope without the tamper-proof features .	-1
I do n't like the self-adhesive seal . I much prefer the peel-and stick . I found the self-sealing was awkward to use , and did n't always like completely flat . Other than that , itOK but I would not buy it .	-1
While these are nice quality envelopes , they actually fail for their advertised purpose : Security.CLAIM # 1 : Security tinted for privacy of contentsWhile there is a blue-tinted square pattern printed on the inside , it 's not very effective in obscuring the content of the envelope . As a test , I placed a check inside the envelope , then held it up against a normal 60W light bulb . I could read everything on the check with little effort , including the account number , payee , amount and signature . FAIL ! CLAIM # 2 : Micro-perfs along flap to indicate possible tamperingThere are 4 slits along the edge of the flap , each about 1/2-inch long . When I attempted to open the sealed flap , it did manage to tear along one of the slits . However , once I realized where the perforations were , I was able to open another sealed envelope carefully without tearing the flap.The flap also only seals along the bottom edge . I was able to thread a dental floss through the side openings of the flap and cut cleanly through the seal in only a few seconds , without even paying regard to the perforations . I was able to reseal the flap without any evidence of tampering whatsoever . FAIL ! When I initially tested the envelope , the adhesive seemed quite strong . However , additional tests during some hot and humid days revealed it to be not up to par .	-1
At first I thought `` How am I going to write a review for an envelope ? '' I mean really , it 's an envelope . So long as it did n't fall apart , it pretty much does its job , eh ? Well , then I used one . First off , you do n't need to lick them to seal them . It 's got a self adhesive on there , which is nice if you do n't feel like licking your envelope.However , the envelopes themselves felt kind of flimsy , like the paper in use is not as high a grade or something . They bend . The envelopes I was using before I got this box from Amazon for review you could put your bill or whatever you 're mailing in there , and the envelope would stay rigid if you held it just on one end . These envelopes do not , they sag when you do the same thing , which feels to me like it 's a lesser quality paper.The no licking part is OK , but I do n't really like the fact that the envelope feels more `` cheap '' when I hold it . I gave this two stars because of the self adhesive , but that was about it .	-1
There are n't many times I shake my head and wonder `` why '' a product exists . Take the common envelope . It 's almost impossible to try to improve on it . But somebody did ... um , try . This one is otherwise a totally normal security envelope , but it will display a red warning if the envelope has been tampered with . Okay , granted , there may be some family-issue instances where a spouse or parent or child opens an envelope then tried to reseal it . But for most of us who mail an envelope somewhere ( honestly I use about 5 envelopes in an entire year anymore with the internet available to do anything I could ever want to do ) and let 's just say some devious person opens it to steal a check or read some personal information ... do you REALLY think they will look at the bright red warning then reseal it and send it on its merry way so the recipient sees that it was opened ? Am I dense ? Is there a need for a product like this . My two stars are generous because I do n't think I 've ever rated a product with one star . Let 's just say they quality of the envelopes is average .	-1
I thought these envelopes were going to be very similar to the AMPAD Pull & Seal Security Envelopes I already use -- they are n't . The AMPAD envelope has a wide strip of adhesive that is covered up by a paper strip and therefore , you have nothing sticky to deal with -- you put your item in the envelope , pull the paper strip off , fold down the envelope flap and you 're done . This product has a very narrow strip of adhesive ( about a third the size of the AMPAD 's adhesive strip ) that is covered by part of the envelope itself . You put your item in the envelope , pull UP the lower flap of the envelope covering the adhesive and then fold DOWN the top envelope flap to meet the adhesive strip you just unfolded.The worst part of using this envelope was that with all the hot , humid weather we are having right now , the lower flap gave me some resistance in coming away from the adhesive . Then I had to make sure the lower flap was laying flat before I closed the upper flap over it ( while avoiding getting my fingers in the adhesive ) . I actually ripped the envelope flap the first time I used one.Security-wise , the imprint inside the envelope seemed fine to me . I put in a piece of paper with heavy ink writing on it and could not see it up against a light . Then again , that piece of paper was probably a little heavier stock than a check would be . The imprint of the AMPAD envelope was much darker and more dense , so I 'd say that it has superior security as well . Even once this product was closed and sealed , it was ridiculously easy to open ! ! Some security.For me , the bottom line is whether I 'd buy the product again , and I would not buy this product again . I will probably keep these as an emergency supply of envelopes for when I run out of the AMPADs , but do n't plan to use these on a regular basis .	-1
These envelopes offer a novel way to seal your security envelopes . Just lift the flap and seal it shut . These would be great for both small and large mailing projects . Although the glue was very sticky and did not allow me to open it without obvious tampering , I would like to have seen a thicker line of glue.The security imprint was not very secure in my opinion . I placed a standard CC bill in it and was able to hold a flashlight to it and read the contents . Perhaps the light blue imprint would defeat a casual nosy person holding it up to the sun or interior light , but if you actually hold the envelope against the light source , it is clearly visible.More glue and darker ink would get more stars .	-1
I use these in an airplane shop to write notes on since I ca n't remember all the parts I remove from an airplane . They worked great for a while , but there 's no mention that they are flammable/ and corrosive . All of my Index Cards deteriorated/disintegrated when a corrosive substance spilled on them in the shop . Some also caught on fire when a heat wand dropped some flame on them . I lost all my work.So , if you 're in a gym glass drawing legs or feet they are great . Or an artist drawing cubist angles , I 'd get them.But if you 're in industry get something more reliable .	-1

Mead is supposed to be a premium office supplies brand so I was rather surprised when I put these index cards to the test . They are not as thick as they used to be , but the problems do not end there . I picked up a handful of different pens , these Mead cards along with the ones from Wexford and Schoolio and wrote the same words with the same pens on all three of them . For most pens ( ink , felt tip , gel , inkjoy ) it was similar , however , with Sharpies ( standard size and bigger ) , the Mead was a disappointment . The ink is bleeding through on the other side , so if you are going to use Sharpies , these have to be one sided index cards or when you write , make sure the two sides do n't overlap . The Wexford was worse at this than the Mead , however , the Schoolio bested Mead . Even though the Schoolio index card does n't have as much paper and it is even more flexible than the Mead.The Schoolio and Wexford have an extra line . The line spacing is the same size ( when you align them from the bottom row ) , but the Mead uses a longer title line , which eats up an extra line . The Mead is physically slightly larger than the Schoolio , by about 0.1cm in width and length.If you are writing with pens ( but not Sharpies or similar ) , you can fill up both sides and they are readable , as long as you do n't put the index cards between yourself and a light source.Tip : if you are a year long index card user , the best time to buy and stock up is the back to school sales season ( Independence Day to Labor Day ) . A lot of stores have index card sales and doorbusters during this period . Unless you are getting premium index cards , paying more than $ 1 per 100pk after the back to school sales end is overkill .	-1
Normally I do n't factor pricing or shipping into a review , because the price can change any time and the shipping is n't really the under the vendor 's control.In this case , the shipping was fine , but the price seems really high for such a commodity . You can pick these up at your local OfficeStapleDepotMax for less money and get a larger quantity.The index cards themselves are fine . An index card is pretty much an index card . These come with both a back and a front and four nifty square corners . We use them for all sorts of purposes around the house . I wo n't be buying any of these Mead cards for $ 3.25 per hundred though .	-1
I use index cards at all to write talking points for meetings and such . Back in the day , Mead index cards were a lot thicker than they are today . Now , I usually just buy them at the dollar store . They are thin but they serve their purpose . But , if one is going to pay around 3-plus dollars for index cards , they better be the thick ones . These , the Mead 3x5-inch index cards are comparable in quality and thickness to the dollar store ones . I had an old pack of Mead index cards and compared them . Wow , what a difference in quality and thickness . I was very surprised that they price went up but that the quality and material used went down.The other issue is that these are so thin that when you write , depending on the pen , the ink can bleed through the other side . You can see impressions of what you wrote on the other side of the index car .	-1
What happened to the index cards of old ? These are so much thinner than the card stock index cards that I 'm used to . I imagine that trying to shuffle these while giving a presentation or speech will be quite difficult . I miss the thickness of the older cards . While these will work for what I need them to they are n't the quality that I was expecting .	-1
Cards ? These are pretty flimsy to be called cards.I was hoping to use these to add to a recipe file box , but they are just not sturdy enough.I also write recipes down when someone asks for a special dish , but even the lines are substandard . As opposed to being crisply printed , they are a bit fuzzy.Unless you are actually LOOKING for 3 x 5 lined paper , take a pass on these .	-1
This paper cutter has some design advantages over the `` rotary '' style cutters that are prevalent in most school and office venues today . In fact , it is the `` old school '' design with updated materials . Instead of the traditional iron handle and wooden base , this unit is made of heavy duty plastic with metal cutting edges . The overall construction feels fairly sturdy - moreso than run of the mill rotary cutters and less so than the original `` old school '' guillotine cutters.My unit had an initial defect that marred its performance . There was a nick in the blade near the juncture of the blade and the board ( near the swivel point ) . This nick was small , about 1/32 '' in size . It is large enough to prevent the cutter from progressing easily until the blade is either forced or maneuvered past it . This makes it difficult to do precise cuts . After grinding off the nick , it works fine . I happen to have the right equipment to do this kind of sharpening , but suspect that many of you do not . So , it is important you inspect your particular unit either in the store ( if you buy locally ) or as soon as you receive your Amazon shipment . This is easy to do . Just pull the cutter out of the box , do n't bother assembling it ( you are required to attache the handle to the end of the blade ) , fully raise the cutter and then lower the cutter back to its starting position . If you feel any jerkiness or hangup in the operation , then you should inspect the blade for nicks or other damage.Once the cutter was put into operational shape , which required fixing the nick and using a screwdriver to attach the handle , it was very good at cutting individual paper . 22 # bond was easily cut in single or multiple sheets up to about six . The box says that the device will cut 10 sheets at one time , but does not specify the weight of the paper . I think 22 # office paper is pretty medium ( most of us see 20-25 # as the range in most offices or homes ) . I think 10 can be done , as I did for my test , but it is not a comfortable amount of paper to cut . My experience was that 10 sheets was taxing on the cutter and that it would not allow as accurate a cut as reducing the load to five sheets . In practice , this should be fine , but it is something to keep in mind . This is not a machine designed for brutal elementary school classroom use , for instance . It 's really for small offices or other such use where portability ( it has a nice built in handle ) , accuracy ( the gauge and scale work fine ) , and clean cuts are the top priorities vs. capacity and ruggedness.If the initial quality had been better , I would have rated this unit a three or possibly four star device .	-1
I 've been using this printer for some months with OS X , currently it 's attached to a Snow Leopard machine using native SL drivers.It would be a fine printer -- it if were more reliable . It seems to go offline fairly often . Sometimes it 's a print jam , but most often there 's no explanation . The OS X status and troubleshooting tool does n't provide any explanation . The firmware is current.I suspect either a hardware problem or a firmware bug .	-1
This printer really worked fine for the first few months . Recently it is making very loud squeaking sounds..like an amplified hamster . It has come to be so annoying that I amputting this in a closet for a backup printer and getting something tolerable . I tried changing theprint toner and cleaning it as per instructions , but it actually got louder .	-1
I have this printer and I also had the 2140 before it . After about 1000 sheets I get a pop up on my computer telling me the toner is bad . I know , starter cartridge , low yield . The problem is , the print quality is fine so I know there is nothing wrong with the toner.Once this cartridge alerts pops up though it will no longer print at all . You will get nothing out of the printer except the alarm . So if you are in the middle of something , be prepared to drop it.Now , replaced the cartridge . About 1500 pages later the same alarm . Print quality is fine but if this printer decides it is time to spend another 40 bucks on a toner cartridge that is that . You can not use the printer until you replace the cartridge.As I said earlier I had the Brother 2140 which was the prior non wireless version . I never saw an alarm such as this . You may have gotten a low toner alarm but if the print quality was ok you could ignore it and get another 500-1000 sheets no problems.So it appears Brother 'fixed ' the ability to actually ignore the alarm as you could with the 2140 by completely disabling the printer in the 2170w model when it decides it is time to pony up some cash.This will be the last Brother product I purchase .	-1
As is the case with every other person here , it is virtually impossible to get this printer to work ... period ... if you want to set it up to work as a wireless printer , good luck ... no can do . I 've now spent over 3 hours on this with no luck.The instruction guide is useless.I will consult with a network specialist friend of mine regarding this but never have I had such problems with a printer . If he ca n't get it to work within a reasonable period of time , I 'll gladly send it back and get something functional.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ... BUY SOMETHING ELSE ... DO YOURSELF A HUGE FAVOR ! ! I would n't ordinarily trash a product , but this is the worst I 've ever seen . Do n't make the mistake I made ... buy an HP , Epson , etc ... Brother should be ashamed for even making this thing ... virtually NOBODY can get it to work ... for those who said they hooked it up successfully through a home network for wireless function , please print detailed instructions ! Thanks and Happy New Year ... do n't buy this printer !	-1
Quite literally . It was an economical printer while it lasted , which was almost 4 years , but every time I printed from it , my voltage regulators would trip . Not just the one it was hooked up to - the thing would brown out my entire house . Then , today , FLASH BANG - one dead voltage regulator , one dead printer , one scared cat in the office . I do not recommend this product .	-1
I had Parker pens growing up and always liked them . They were a 'special treat ' and great quality . Since this was a good price on Amazon I decided to give it a try . I was very disappointed as an overall writing instrument . It is a very lightweight , thin , not that comfortable to write with pen . Basically you are paying for the Parker ink cartridge . It ends up , frankly , being a cheap , light , basic case no better than your 10 for $ 5 pens with a good ink cartridge . So you get what you pay for here : an ink cartridge and a bad , small ( men with big hands stay away ) very disappointing case that adds nothing to the cartridge at all .	-1
Brother was very wasteful of material and promoting bad enviornmental practices to require the entire replacement of the large plastic unit . All that 's really needed is the long dark tube DR-360 . Unfortunately , Brother designed it so you have to purchase the entire unit when it should have made the tube removable . It 's totally wasteful and I 'm sure the plastic will not be recycled but will end up in a dump somewhere . Very sad these corporations are doing this to make more money rather than have any consideration for their customer and our environment at large.My drum light started to flash after about 12,000 prints .	-1
I was not happy to learn that although there is plenty of toner left in my cartridge , it stopped printing in my important printing job because 'toner has reached the end of its useful life'.I wo n't be buying any more Brother products in the future . This is just a cynical way to make more money.Brother 's attitude : 'The customer ? ' 'Shaft the customer ! 'Apparently this cartridge loves the idea of doing the same thing to its customers as well . I 'm shopping elsewhere !	-1
The product description is incorrect . It says this is a high-yield cartridge . It is the standard cartridge.For $ 10 more you can but the TN360 , which is the high-yield cartridge . It prints 2,600 rather than 1,500 ( though in practice 2,300 and 1,200 are more typical -- and , of course , you want to cover the sensor with tape to keep it printing for another 200 pages or so ) .I have submitted a product description correction.I feel tricked ! My cartridge lasted half of what I 'd expected -- because it 's NOT high yield .	-1
The first disappointment with this product came after opening the package . It 's nothing more than a cheap and unattractive piece of plastic -- nothing you 'd want to hang on your wall . The second major problem is the size . Although it might technically be 8.5 by 11 inches , the interior volume of the sleeve is smaller . Therefore whatever object you place inside it will have to be smaller than a standard-size piece of paper . Due to these flaws the product was useless to me .	-1
For this review , I 'll be comparing to my designed-for-matte-paper Canon Pixma Pro9500 photo printer . The Epson R1900 photo printer is designed more for glossy prints , so it 's interesting to compare the two.Test bed : MscBook Pro , OS X 10.5.5Apple Cinema Display 23 '' , color-calibrated with a Spyder2 Pro.Adobe Photoshop CS3Ilford Galerie Smooth Pearl paperIlford Inkjet Glossy Photo paper.The box is packaged as you might expect . Tape all over the place . Once you get the printer de-taped , you 'll find an assortment of ink cartridges , and , *generously* , an extra gloss optimizer cartridge . I purposely put an asterisk on either side of that work , because this cartridge is notorious for running out rather quickly.After getting the printer set up , cartridges installed , it 's time to install the drivers . This goes smoothly - stick the CD in the drive and you 're away.OK , let 's move on to printing . After editing a few shots in Photoshop with a very specific color cast , I printed them on both my Canon Pixma Pro9500 and the Epson R1900 with the correct paper profiles for each , and using both paper types listed above . The difference was not huge , but being able to compare the two , it was obvious which was more accurate : the Canon . No question . The Epson added a slight yellow cast to each photo , which drives me nuts . The Canon was spot on each time . Interestingly , I purchased the Ilford glossy paper specifically for this review , and was blown away that the Canon had no trouble at all printing to it , and produced a much more pleasing tone compared to the original image . This said , and to the Epson 's credit , the actual print quality is VERY comparable between the Canon and the R1900.But , frustratingly , the Epson R1900 seems incapable of properly printing borderless . First , it crops a little off all four edges , whereas the Canon crops an almost unnoticeable amount by comparison . But worst of all , every Epson borderless print left a few ink spots on the very right hand edge of every landscape shot . I called Epson directly and they said it was `` normal '' for borderless shots to get an excess of ink on the edges . Fair enough , but the Canon has no such trouble , so this is disturbing to those who want to feed a 4x6 and end up with a 4x6 print without a border to trim.Lastly , the printer was used a few times this week , and as of the morning this review was written , the prints coming out were disastrous , akin to a Polarioid halfway through its `` transformation '' process . I ran a nozzle test , and indeed , the ink must have somehow dried out overnight . I had to a run a full head clean , which resolved the issue . Again , I ca n't help but make the comparison that the Pixma Pro9500 has never had this issue since the day I got it , many months ago . Not impressive that the Epson has this issue after several days ... Overall , I ca n't really recommend this printer . It crops the edges too much , gets ink on the edges on borderless prints , does n't print accurate colors even after calibration , and eats ink like you would n't believe . And the jet clogging has just left me paranoid ... 2/5	-1
Magic jack does n't disclose before porting your number to magic jack include : Ported number renewal fee ( Never heard of any company charging renewal of ported number 2 . If you want to release the same number and move it to another carrier ( because of terrible call quality and terrible customer service ) , they will charge you another $ 30.00 whammy on you . This is a hog wash . There is no call log , no phone customer service , on top of these unscrupulous fees . They never mention that they will charge renewal fee on a ported number and they will also charge $ 30.00 if you take the number to another carrier before your porting transaction with magic jack is complete . This is unbelievable ! ! one year experience : Lost calls , choppy calls , NO CALL LOGS , and for call forwarding you have to go through plethora of web links and chart sessions to get the web link and you have to do the same to remove the call forwarding too . I am closing my magicjack account and will move to either Nettalk or vonage or Ooma : none of them have ported number fee , and no phone number release fees . I know , vonage and Nettalk provide call log for free .	-1
I got this to save money on phone bills but it 's very frustrating to use.Pros:1 . Cheap2 . Pretty Clear ReceptionCons:1 . I do n't want that keypad on my computer on all of the time , I try to hide it but every time you make a call it pops up again . I just stick it off to the side so you can only see the edge of it.2 . The keypad is bad enough but it is constantly has an advertisement window trying to sell more services , very annoying.3 . I have to set my home phone answering machine on 2 rings so the Magicjack answering service wo n't pick up my messages , you cant turn their answering service off and you ca n't even change the amount of rings before it sends it to the magicjack voice mail . Another thing about the answering service it gives a sales pitch to the people before they can leave a message.4 . Customer service are a bunch of idiots . They can not even answer simple questions and if you have a Mac do n't even bother calling them you would get more help asking your dog what to do.5 . Every time I get an incoming call while I 'm talking on the phone my line disconnects . That 's when I found out the customer service people were a bunch of idiots.6 . When I 'm on the computer and a call comes in or my wife uses it the magicjack keypad will pop up onto my screen and interrupt what I 'm doing on the computer . Small but annoying.As you can see the Con 's outweigh the Pro 's by over double . If I had to do it again I would n't get it again . I 'm thinking of cutting my losses and go with another service since this magicjack has too many shortcomings .	-1
The device worked well for me , but after 4 months , they shut off my Magicjack for violation of terms of service . It took a bit of effort to find out what was violated and they claimed excessive use . There is no support number ; you have to get support online only with live chat or from their knowledge base . There is a billing questions number and you can call that . That 's the only way to get a live person , but they only want you to call it for billing questions.The problem is you have no idea what constitutes excessive use or when you might be exceeding their limits . The terms of service says if your usage exceeds 20 times more than the average customer or more than 50 calls a day you have violated the terms . The 50 calls is easy to quantify , but what about the 20 times more than the average ? The terms also say it is not limited to just this criteria , so you have no clue what other criteria they might use to decide that you have had excessive use . There is no way to know what that is . Instead of just suspending your service for a while , they cut you off permanently with no recourse . You lose any remaining time you may have paid for.If you are a light phone user , MagicJack may be okay for you , but do n't expect to be on the phone for a lot of time or they may cut you off for excessive use , with no recourse , since you must agree to the terms of service . I would never get this device again . Read those terms of service before you agree to use this device .	-1
I did not purchase my magic jack ( MJ ) through Amazon but rather through the MJ website itself . My biggest complaint about MJ is the voice call quality and dropped calls . Often , the person you are talking to ca n't hear you and you have to repeat yourself a lot during MJ to landline or mobile phone conversations . The second thing I hate about MJ is the echo you get frequently . This drives me absolutely crazy when having a phone conversation . You say `` hello '' for example and then you hear the echo `` hello '' back or whatever it is that you said . This is very distracting and annoying . I suppose you get what you pay for . I have been using MJ for many years . I was even dumb enough to purchase a 5 year service contract but after it expires , I will not renew . Their customer support also sucks . They do n't even have a toll free 1-800 number to call if you have a problem . You have to get online and establish a chat connection for tech . support . I know they will tell you they have to do this to keep costs down but this is horrible . I predict this company will eventually go belly up due to the poor call quality and customer support . I just purchased an Obi VOIP phone adapter to try out with google voice . I hope this will be a lot better positive experience than what I 've had with MJ for the last few years . No matter how cheap the device or service , I personally still demand a min . level of quality that is acceptable to me . MJ has fallen way below that level so they have now lost a customer for life . From what I have seen and read , Ooma seems to be the best thing going but the up front cost for the unit is pretty high and there is still a nominal monthly ( $ 3 - $ 5 ) regulatory fee each month after you buy the unit which I do n't quite understand .	-1
When I bought this thing I was assured it was a trial . Since two years were cheaper , I went with that . I was also told that I would n't be charged for the 30 day trial . Next day , a year of service hit my bank . The phone did n't work at all in my area , so I tried to get customer service on the phone for return - nada . No answer , no voicemail , nothing . I returned the thing as instructed on the invoice , and after a suitable amount of time to get the return , they charged me $ 89 and I could n't get it back no matter what . What a bunch of crooks .	-1
Vey cheap . I had high speed internet and people would tell me I sounded choppy . Expect it to only last 6 month as cheaply made . There are many more products out there like Basic Talk . Although it 's $ 9.99 a month for basic talk in the long run a mich better product . I 'd stay away from this product .	-1
This sounds like a great deal -- and it is if you never have to acutally use your phone , but need a numberso you can say you have a home phone nubmer , but never have to actually use it . I have had MagicJack for 2 years , and they are so far beyond horrible , I ca n't even say it in words . It seams like there is always one of the services like caller ID , voice mail , or call forwarding that is not working or services are removed and they do not tell or notify you , and sitll show on the website that they are an available feature . No chance of speaking to a live person for service - only CHAT through a translater system and most of the ones I have worked with have not been very knowledgeable . Remember the services is approximate $ 30 per year - not per month AND YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ! ! - VERY LITTLE . ( if Amazon allowed for negative stars this would be a -2 )	-1
As of this review : 317 5-star ratings , and 486 1-star ratings . This product has been out for years and they still do n't have the bugs worked out . Great idea , but obviously does n't work consistently . And I would n't doubt that the inventor is a billionaire even though the product is krap .	-1
Great concept . It would have been four star item if it did n't drop my calls after three minutes of talking on the phone . Also I do n't know why , but it interferer with my Skype . I ended up buying ooma , which is more expensive , but considerably better .	-1
Sent one back a couple of years ago because the sound quality was terrible . Just spent over two hours `` chatting '' with four different techs . They could not even get it to work . This one goes back tomorrow .	-1
As a Sunrocket customer who got left for dead when they went belly up , i 've been trying to find something that worked as well . Signed up for Vonnage and about 15 minutes later cancelled since I found powerphone , which worked , but their pricing model bothered me since they threw in so many fees that were n't part of the up front thing I signed up for . So tried this , and it worked intermittently for a while . I do n't like having to have a computer running for this to plug into though , and while I stuck with it for a couple months ( since i run a media center PC that is always running , so could use that ) but found that the smallest thing could make it not work . I had a windows update that broke it - i could talk and be heard , but the ear piece no longer played any sound . And a few weeks ago when I started testing Windows 7 it 's incompatible of course . Not a surprise or their fault , but just shows how much of a pain it is to have a phone that is so totally dependent on compatibility with a computer . And the inability to do things like disable voicemail so i could use my internal answering machine was frustrating . I did not like their support model either , just someone you chat with online , who has no real knowledge and just reads from a script . Have since purched an Ooma and am tossing the magic jack in the garbage .	-1
MagicJack was always a shaky proposition in terms of quality , but it was a cheap option . But there are much better quality options a fairly low prices . For instance , Walmart sells a VoIP device that costs $ 10 a month , and a wireless portable one at $ 15 a month.I prefer to use theOBi100 VoIP Telephone Adapter and Voice Service Bridgewhich connects to my Google Voice account , right now . Granted , Google seems to have little interest in Voice , so I do n't know how much longer this combo will last , but for now there is no monthly charge , and the OBI device is quite inexpensive.If MagicJack charged ten or 15 dollars a year for service , it might be worth considering , but at $ 30 it 's too expensive .	-1
I wrote a very long review , which completely justified my two star review and included a technical description of the problem I discovered . I decided not to post it . Instead , I 'll give you the highlights.I thought this was a great idea . Little box the size of a cigarette lighter that would expose a telephone connection - or let you have access to the phone system from your laptop . No premium phone calls allowed unless you prepay - so it is safe to put the phone where anyone can use it.I plugged it in - and it did n't work . Called support , and they refused to believe that the problem could be at their end . Their diagnosis would have had them believe that the problem was at my end - and it would have had me believe it was well - except that I know better , because I 'm a retired IT tech and have diagnostic tools that most people do not have . I ran packet traces and did other advanced diagnosis stuff , proved to anyone who was capable of understanding the technical issues ( which a L2 disgnostic person should be capable of if they are providing fix-it support to people ) that the problem was at their end and had to call in twice before I could find someone in their high level tech support who actually would believe that they had a problem and who would take a problem report . The first guy acted like he really could not even understand what I was driving at , the second guy understood that I had eliminated all possibilities other than they were broken - and I was able to show him the data in the packet that had misled their application.The mistake they made is well known in the industry - you can find papers describing it and software packages that try and address it , which makes me think that the support software was written by some kids in a college class rather than by professionals - or they would have known the problem and not tried to short-cut it.They made other errors of the same sort : Their outlook interface is one way ( they do n't add the outlook contacts to the contact list in the package , they just add a button to the outlook contact screen ) and they do n't select the default sound devices when you change configuration from the telephone line to the computer 's mic and speakers ( nor do they select the devices you configured last time - they throw away the whole config and pick the first devices in the list , which are almost never the correct ones ) . This means that you ca n't hear the phone ring and andwer it from the computer - you have to reconfigure three sub-devices , which means that the person who called you has given up and hung up by the time you can say hello.Now it will probably work for most people in a simple home configuration . But anything out of the ordinary is likely to trip up this poorly programed device . So the dream of being able to carry it with you so that you can have a conversation from wi-fi hot spots is doomed to failure , I think . You might get lucky . You might not - even at places that have well designed commercial setups.If you want to give this to a teenager so that they can make endless phone calls , fine . ( But not too long - if they use more than 20 times the average , and lots of these will not be used , you have exceeded their unlimited plan and they will cancel your service , with no refund ) . Do n't think you can depend on it for home use , and the quality is not good enough for business , there were dropouts and breaks on a line where Vonage is perfect.This device requires a working computer to support it - you ca n't talk to tech support while they have you reboot your computer , for example , because rebooting the computer drops the conversation . So , well , it might be correctly priced at $ 20/year.Two stars might be too high - but I can imagine worse , and it is not too expensive .	-1
It 's as bad as everyone says . Non-existent customer support . Takes over computer 's entire internet connection for 10-15 minutes at bootup on a quad-core , very fast computer . Stutters . People ca n't hear me talking or complain it 's messed up . It takes over the screen everry time a call is made or comes in , throwing up spam . It is NOT unlimited . Read the terms of use . After about 50 calls a day , they terminate your account and keep your money . This company had an `` F '' with the BBB until they paid them off . Suddenly , they went to an `` A '' .The owner of this company should be sent to prison and never allowed to use a telephone again as punishment for this piece of junk .	-1
I was happy for a few hours . By the end of the day , I removed it and returned it to Walmart . I have a fast roadrunner cable service . Movies download fast . MJ service was usable but static present . I could live with that . We use our cells for all our calls , and have no land line , so this was just a supplement.The problem . This is one big spyware program . May not fit the definition of real spyware , but any program that forces unwanted advertising on my computer is bad news . It also tracks every number you call . It 's almost invisible in your computer . It does n't show up in the program files , or the add/remove list . No uninstaller function . Programs are sold by third parties to uninstall the program . This is poor business practice . I 'm kicking myself . My speed slowed greatly . Speed increased after I dumped as many files as I could . I have several spyware removal programs , and here I voluntarily loaded one of the worst.This item had great possibilities , and may have been a home run had the owners practiced good business ethics , instead of treating their customers like total fools .	-1
I got a brand new / sealed one of these , plugged it in , created the account , got a phone number , and then got prompt to create new account , went thru the same routine over , and over , and more over . Went to the MJ website and was advised by the chat person that my account is under review ! ! ! ! ! and I should call customer service , the CS rep. repeated the same & # 34 ; account under review & # 34 ; and told me to call later because they are having a high volume callers now ! ! ! .Each time they ask for name , phone number , email address , etc ... Same routine was repeated every time I called , over , and over , ... . , still no service.Do yourself a favor and buy something else . You will save money and lots of frustration .	-1
I bought Magic Jack hoping I can save money on my phone bill . It so happens Magic Jack phone device does n't work . I immediately follow their direction and put it in different USB port and wait for FULL 3 minutes for it to install . It did n't work nor show any sign of installation . My computer run in Window Vista and later I try it on my laptop which runs in Window 7 and it does n't work . I know its not my computer because I try it on my friends as well . Still it does n't work . I thought it suppose it to be easy as 1-2-3 obvious its not . I highly recommend nobody to buy this . There is a reason why there is 355 negative reviews of 1 stars than good . Bad Quality !	-1
I bought this hoping for a second line but it did not work very good.sound was awful , static and tunnel sound . Could not hear my friends they kept complaining they could not here me.I sent it back and got my money back , but not return postqage as they promised.They never discontinued my account I still : after 6 months , get email messages saying I have messages on my email account . This means I aqm still connected to MJ , I called and they kept me on the net for a total of 2 1/2 hours and basically said nothing , So every time I get a prank call or annoyance call my internet connect is compromised and I get an email telling me I have a message.I am still conected to MJ and I will be contacting some government agency such as the FTC , or public advocate , or Board of public utilities.If we all do this when we are not happy with these products maybe they will think twice about messing with the public .	-1
I 've used tissue that seemed more sturdy than this board . The magnets are very weak . The board fell right off the fridge and the plastic boarder cracked . Not very well made at all .	-1
I ordered this because I like to keep a running grocery list on the side of our refrigerator - and write reminders to myself or my husband.Unfortunately the magnets are not strong enough to hold it to the refrigerator - it just slides down the refrigerator to the floor , no matter how delicately I try to position it . That is frustrating and disappointing.Everything else works well , the marker , the eraser , the magnets to attach notes or coupons to the board , etc . Everything except the magnets on the back of the board.This can be permanently mounted with double sided sticky tape - if you plan to do that , then I recommend this . But if you want to use it on a filing cabinet or refrigerator , I do not recommend it .	-1
This whiteboard is so poorly made ! It 's cardboard and flimsy plastic held together with staples . The flimsy plastic clip that holds the pen bent the first time I pulled the pen out and now it 's too loose to hold the pen.I misunderstood from the description that it needs to be attached with ( included ) double stick mounting tape ; I had thought it was magnet mount , but it is not . I do n't want to attach it to my wall or fridge with the tape because it 's so cheaply made , I think I 'll need to replace it after a month or do , and that mounting tape is always so hard to remove from whatever it 's attached to . So I guess this will get donated to my kids ' school or some such .	-1
My board does not look exactly like the picture.I has the marker , the magnets but the frame is bi-color ( black and white ) .The frame feels like ready to break apart.The provided magnets are so weak they can not support the weight of the board on any vertical surface without sliding.I know this item is not frankly expensive but the quality should at least match the expectations ... It is not the case and therefore the item is not worth more than 2 stars .	-1
This dry erase board is about the size of a letter-sized sheet of paper . It comes with 4 double stick pads that you can use to either attach it permanently to a surface or to attach the magnets so you can put the board on a metal surface . I planned to put it on my refrigerator , so after I took off the overwrap , I put the double stick pads on each corner and then put the magnets on them . You also need to attach the pen holder where you want it placed . There are 2 round magnets that I pulled on to see how strong they were and found they were REALLY strong , or so I though , at first . Actually , they are attached to the board with that gummy sticky stuff . The little square stayed stuck to the board when I removed one and to the magnet when I removed the other . It was not easy to remove the sticky stuff from either , but was really hard removing it from the magnet.Finally , I was ready to put it on my refrigerator . I positioned it , let go , and watched it slide down my refrigerator . I thought maybe it was the texture of my refrigerator , even though other magnets stick just fine , so I tried it on a smooth filing cabinet . Same result . The magnets are not strong enough to hold the weight of the board . Once you have attached the magnets , you can not remove them and use the pads to permanently attach it to the surface - not that I 'd want to permanently attach it to my refrigerator.The pen does work well and I like the eraser on the cap . Just wish I could put this where I could actually use it .	-1
As a dry erase board this works well . It 's just big enough to be noticeable and small enough not to be annoying . I got it to replace a similar board that recently met with an unfortunate accident . My old board was a different brand , ( I ca n't remember what one ) that had similar magnets that you attach with the included double sided sticky pads , but my old one stayed on the fridge and did n't move , this one slides right off . If you can , you 're better off just sticking in place with the sticky tape . I may be able to salvage the magnets from old board , .I 'm going to try that and see how long it lasts but 's it 's kind of a disappointment since I know with proper magnets it would work like it should .	-1
Not cedar ! Not sure why this came up in a search for cedar pencils . They almost feel and smell like plastic .	-1
Parents , do n't buy these for your child . I am a teacher and at one time I highly recommended these pencils and purchased them from Amazon . Not anymore ! It is now a 50/50 gamble whether or not the lead will break multiple times , even as the pencils are being sharpened . Though these are somewhat better than the juck pencils that are sold under the Staples brand name , they are a far cry from the good pencils that in the past were labeled with the Ticonderoga name . Sorry , but I DO NOT recommend these pencils . Keep them down in Mexico or wherever you throw them together .	-1
The Photosmart Pro B8850 is a professional-grade printer from HP designed as a cheaper version of theHP Photosmart Pro B9180 Printer . It produces very high quality prints up to 13 '' x 19 '' using pigment ink printing , which results in much higher quality images than traditional ink jet or laser . If you have never heard of pigment ink , you probably do not need this printer . At roughly $ 6 a print , the B8850 is n't designed for printing mapquest directions , but exhibition prints or those suitable for framing.The first thing I noticed about this printer is that it is BIG . It weighs around 40 pounds and takes up a large footprint on your desktop , so make sure you have the room for it . Secondly , it is a very complete package . The printer looks great , and it comes with all the ink to get started ( 8 different inks ) , plus 25 sheets of HP Photo Paper , and a folder to store your paper in so it does n't get damaged ( at almost $ 2 a sheet you will be thankful for it ) . Setup was very easy and took around 45 minutes to setup the printer and calibrate the ink cartridges . Unlike most HP software that I am familiar with for their printers and scanners , the software that comes with this printer is not too bad . It is not as bloated as their other software and most of the applications are fairly useful.As to the quality of the prints , I could n't be happier . The inks HP uses are very good quality . They blend well , and after doing some research , I discovered that they are not likely to fade over time . Of course this is useful for digital artists who plan to keep their pictures displayed for years . My wife does most of her photography of wedding engagements , so this is very important to her . HP claims their inks to last around 200 years , so I will update this review in 2208 with those results . As far as the ink usage goes , it seems to be fairly acceptable based on other printers I 've used of this type . I mainly print full 13x9 sheets and I 'm at roughly 40 % ink left on the colors after 25 prints . The calibration tests also used up some of the inks , so take that into consideration . If you are printing letter , you will use considerably less . Ink cartridges run around $ 25 per cartridge , or a little over $ 230 for a full set.HP B8850 vsHP Photosmart Pro B9180 Printer : B8850 can print up to .7mm thick while the B9180 can print up to 1.5mmB8850 has no LCD Panel and uses status lights instead . I 've seen the LCD on the B9180 and , while useful , there 's really nothing on there that I need too badly . It is useful having a text message explain something to me rather than having to look up the status light legend in the manual , but after a few days I had all of the lights memorized so it is really not a big deal.Sleep mode added . This is one of the real advantages of this model . If you do n't use your printer everyday and sometimes go weeks without using it , this prevents the inks from drying out and conserves the print heads.These three changes are the only real differences I could find . Currently , there is only a $ 50 difference in price between the two printers . If you need the benefit of printing card stock , I think you should go for the B9180 , but in every other application I would say it is not worth it and this printer is a better option.Update August 2008 - Two months later , I still love this printer and have had to replace the inks twice . Although it was very expensive to replace all of the cartridges , we have actually begun selling our prints , which more than make up for the price of the ink . We have started selling our prints in a local restaurant and it is amazing how good these look . Previously , we were using a third party to print our images . If we had actually purchased this printer , I estimate we would have broken even on the price in a few weeks.Update April 2012 - I stopped using this printer a couple years ago after continual paper jams to the point where it would shred the paper , and I would spend the next twenty minutes picking out scraps of paper from it . That , combined with the cost of the inkheads now discourages me from recommending this printer to anyone . I have since replaced it with theCanon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer ( 3295B002 ) which I am much more satisfied with , especially due to the size comparison .	-1
Keep in mind this phone really should be powered by its AC adapter or , at the very least , a small 9 volt battery . How long a tiny 9 volt battery will last is an open ended question.Without AC power , the phone barely functions . Yet , to be fair , in some vague way you can still say it functions . Without power - the lights for which line is in use do n't work , the speaker phone does not work , and virtually every other function of this phone will not work . Yet to be extremely fair , you could make a phone call - just do n't expect even a simple led to light up when you select which phone line you want to use or even to light up if the phone rings.I have had a few Panasonic multi-line phones over the years and they all worked perfectly , even without a power adapter or batteries.This phone also has a POOR interface : When I plugged this phone in - using the supplied AC adapter - I got a bright red light on line 2 saying a message was waiting . No such message existed and I could not figure out how to extinguish it . I do n't think I should need to consult a manual or call customer support to use a basic two line phone ! The bottom line is this phone is a step backward from the traditional designs which are decades old . These older designs were powered by the phone lines themselves and had simple pushbuttons and lights . What used to be a simple press of a button to select line 1 or 2 is no longer so simple on this phone . You have lights and what appear to be corresponding push buttons on this phone yet sometimes they are not push buttons - just raised pieces of chromed plastic . A very confusing layout for what should be a simple device.This phone is being shipped back to Amazon as I type this.One Star - NOT recommended	-1
The phone itself is decent enough , but the loud-speaker was n't very clear . Several folks in my family had a hard time understanding people when using it . A replacement did n't help ; apparently it 's just the design . If you like to use the speaker-phone feature , keep looking .	-1
I must constantly redial numbers because this phone does NOT record a ten-digit number if it is dialed other than slowly . You must wait for about 15 seconds to have a recorded message tell you -- incorrectly -- that you did not dial the required 10 digits . This is incorrect because all ten digits that you dialed show up in the Caller ID screen . AT & T said they will replace the phone for $ 15 , but it would be with another Model 993 . I believe the problem is in the design and engineering of the phone and that a new unit will not correct my problem .	-1
First phone developed multiple problems in less that 15 days . Construction seems flimsy , two number buttons started sticking within 5 days . Weight is not enough to keep phone in place when handset cord is stretched near to 2/3 's length.Volume through Plantronics headset purchased with the phone is very low . Do n't know if it 's the phone or the headset . Speaker phone and handset volume seem adequate.Would not buy this combination again .	-1
I purchased the Canon Pixma MX850 to replace an HP that had died after 7 good years . We need it to print and scan plus receive faxes automatically on a single household phone line without interfering with regular voice calls or an answering machine . This is NOT possible with the Canon . You can receive calls normally with your answering machine functioning but having to manually start fax reception OR you can have faxes picked up automatically and no answering machine . So how 's that going to work when you 're not home but need to receive faxes and voice calls on the same line ? It does n't ! HP 's worked perfectly so despite lower reviews on other quality factors with HP , I 'm going back to an HP AIO . The Pixma MX850 is a pretty nice looking device , the print quality is good but I need it to do the faxing right . If it does n't matter to you , I 'd say it would be okay to buy . One other issue , instead of a single interface for all functions , it installs multiple kinds of software on your computer to do different functions , and I 'm not sure if you actually even need them , or if it 's just a bunch of bloatware .	-1
It was a very heavy duty machine , all metal , and worked well for just about a year , with only a couple of times where I had to take it apart to remove jammed plastic ... But then ... it ate a document so thoroughly that there was no getting it out . Smoke was pouring out of the machine and the plastic pouch was completely adhered to the inner heating rod ! Even after almost completely disassembling it , there was still no getting all the plastic out of there and we have had to scrap it and buy something better . You get what you pay for ?	-1
I bought this and it does not heat the laminate enough make it stiff ... . just & # 34 ; kind of sort of & # 34 ; enough to bond the two sheets together . I used another laminator here at the office and with the same film it works great . So I know the issue is with this machine.I 'll chalk this one up as & # 34 ; You get what you pay for & # 34 ; ... in this case I should have purchased something that costs more than $ 18.I threw away the packaging so returning it is out of the question now . I should have known better.1 star for not working at all .	-1
'Cuz when I got it there were more pieces rattling around inside than a movie theater size box of Razenettes !	-1
So far I 've had this printer almost two weeks , and I think I 've finally figured out how to get it to stop crippling my system.At first , the drivers on the CD caused my internet connection to drop every minute or so . I downloaded the latest drivers from the HP website and at first it appeared that things improved , but I discovered that the drivers caused my computer to hang after a short time and hose my system so bad it would n't even shut down ! On one occasion of turning my computer off without shutting down , it actually messed up my operating system and I had to rebuild my machine ! I can definitively trace the problem to the HP drivers because the problems occur only after installing the drivers , the problems disappear when the drivers are uninstalled , and even on a freshly built system I experience the same issues right after installing the HP drivers ! For those stuck in a similar rut , here 's the steps I 've gone through after many hours of tinkering and talking with HP support to get things working ( hopefully ) :1 . Download the latest drivers from the HP site . Version 4.42.0.0 seems to work okay.2 . Do n't install the `` Smart Web Printing '' components ( they may hang IE ) .3 . Give your printer a static IP address through the controls on the physical printer ( you ca n't do it through the management software ) .4 . Disable the three HP-related services in services.msc.5 . DO NOT allow an automatic update installing the ~April 2008 Imaging Device Functions `` critical patch '' which will corrupt your system.Other than the driver problems , the printer itself is fantastic . I 've had printers hooked up to print servers before , but never an all-in-one that allowed printing , scanning AND fax-related activities over the network . The supporting software is also fantastic . Not only can you launch a scan from your network-connected computer , but you can designate that you want it in a searchable format ( .pdf , .rtf , etc . ) and the optical character recognition ( OCR ) software does a good job of recognizing text and sizing it appropriately ( thus the scan is not just an image , but a document whose text you can cut/paste/etc . ) .Also , apparently you have the ability to have received faxes save straight to your computer over the network instead of being printed out , the two-sided printing is better for the environment , as is the Energy Star rating which is a big plus in my book ! In short , the driver situation makes this purchase a sketchy one , at least for Vista owners , but the great features and capabilities of this printer have me hanging on instead of returning the printer hoping that HP will eventually resolve the problems.UPDATE : Actually , even with the above tweaks , I still exprienced problems with the drivers crashing my system ( e.g . freezing after waking up from sleep mode ) . I even went so far as to downgrade from 64-bit to 32-bit , but my system is still dragged down by this piece of garbage and there 's no ETA on an updated driver which has sat unchanged for at least three months.Sad . It 's a good product marred by awful drivers/software.I 'd take both stars away if I could.SECOND UPDATE : If you 're looking for a good WiFi printer , but own Vista , consider theEpson WorkForce 600 ( which I 'm now using successfully with Vista ) orHP 's Officejet Wireless 6500 , which is basically the `` certified for Vista '' version of the J6480 .	-1
Out of the box this item was plenty comfortable and colorful . The kids loved it . But within a couple weeks it had popped and the gel was oozing out . Not sure whether that 's a construction problem or an abuse by kids problem , but either way it did n't stand up too well .	-1
This certainly seems like it might be a great cart , but I had no opportunity to find out because of the way it was packed . After opening Amazons absurdly large and poorly taped box , fighting through layers of torn cardboard and paper , I was confronted by the largest amount of tape I 've ever sen . This tape , clear and sticky , was difficult to remove , and the little that I diod get off the product left a thick , sticky residue behind . It would 've taken a few hours to clean the cart , since the tape was on every surface . ( see photos ) What a thoughtless way to ruin a perfectly serviceable product . And yes , it does stink too . Needless to say , I returned it . I 'm not sure who has enough time and will to dedicate a whole day to cleaning of a new product , but I sure think that it ought to arrive clean . Also , I 've never seen a worse packing job from Amazon . I had to use an entire roll of packing tape to get the package back into some approximation of a box to send this thing back . I can only guess that this item used to be delivered in a more reasonable condition , given the many favorable reviews , but as of May 2011 , you get an unholy , stinking mess for your money . Stay away .	-1
[ ... ] The above shopping cart is from Kmart and its rocks . First I bought this and it wasawful ... not good enough . Then I got the one in the link and WOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Do n't make the same mistake as me ! I do NOT work for KMART or the company thatmakes this cart ! HONEST !	-1
After using this cart very lightly ( 2 to 3 times a month ) for about 4 months , I can not think of anything that liked about it.The construction quality was below average when compared with other similar products . The material used , though appeared to be metal-based , was very fragile . The tiny rods could be bent very easily by a 5-year-old.The assembly was a nightmare because when I received it , they included a front rod from a smaller model of this cart so that did n't fit . Amazon shipped the replacement right-away but it shows that the manufacturer ( not Amazon ) had no quality controls - resulting in frustration and dissatisfaction from the very start.The instructional manual that was included was totally worthless because it included rough sketches ( and not actual pictures ) of parts to assemble . The actual instructions were apparently translated using Google Translate from some other language ( perhaps Chinese ? ) .The wheels were held by thin pins and I remember thinking that this is definitely not going to last long . The wheels themselves were of very poor quality material that was that appeared like a hybrid between rubber and plastic.You may have noticed that I 'm using the past tense when talking about this cart . That 's because about a month ago , the wheel lost the pin that was hold it . I do n't remember where it was dropped . I could go buy another pin from Home Depot but I am not going to because that 's not the only problem that I 'm seeing with this cart . I 've noticed back rod that joins the two wheels is also bending so the wheels are not long straight . It makes pushing this cart even more difficult now . Oh , talking about wheels , I forgot to mention that one of the biggest disappointments with this cart was finding out that the front wheels can not turn so the cart can only go straight . To turn you have to really pull the cart toward you so the front two wheels are not touching the ground and then you can maneuver it.In retrospect , I should have returned it for full refund when I found out that the rod did n't fit instead of requesting a replacement .	-1
UPDATE 2 : After a couple years of VERY light use , my opinion of this phone has dramatically gone down hill . At first there were little glitches , like how every call that comes in , even ones that are answered , show as missed calls on the phone . That , I could live with . But , they also developed a habit of losing thier link to the base , for no apparent reason . One of the handsets has completely gone bad . Another will only ring and cuts out if you try to answer it , even when at the base , so it 's not out of range , and despite having a full charge on the battery . I 'm down to my last functioning handset , which also cuts out , but usually only when I talk for 20 to 30 minutes . I do n't use the phones that much , so I 'm still debating whether to replace them or cancel my basic phone service . Should I replace them , it definitely wo n't be with another Panasonic . I know from past experience with their dvd players that Panasonic does n't believe in standing behind their products . Their warranties are some of the worst in the industry at 1 year parts , but only 90 days labor , which the labor is often 2/3 of the bill.I 've used this 3-phone set for a year or two and have been very happy with the design and performance . They replaced a previous set of Panasonic phones , as I needed a third base and found it more affordable to buy this set of 3 new than to purchase a new unit from Panasonic for my previous set . I 'm glad I did , as not only did these phones cost less than the 2-phone Panasonic set I previously bought , despite an open box discount at Circuit City ( amazon is definately the first place I 'll check for prices from now on ) , but this set improves on the previous generation in features , range and , most important to me , sound quality . This is the clearest sounding phone I think I 've had since switching from tethered to cordless . I have n't owned too many different models , but of the GE 's , Unidens , V-Techs , and even previous generation Panasonics that I have used , none were as clear as even the speaker phone function on this phone , which is what I primarily use and when I ask , people I 'm talking to never even realize they 're on speaker , so the transmitting receiver must be pretty good too.The phones range is phenomenal . I 've carried it outside , talking at least 50 yards from the house and even further from the base , without even a hint of static or signal loss . It has a large feature set , but I 'm not really a phone person , so I have n't used most of what it can do , other than the basic phone and answering machine functions . That you can automatically transfer your contacts to the other phones is much more convenient than having to program them into each phone separately , but I was used to that from the previous Panasonic I used . I like that it has an intercom function and the included belt clip is nice too . I rarely am around a phone enough to use it , but I leave it attached just in case , as it does n't seem to hinder sound clarity , despite it partially covering the speaker phone speaker.My sole criticism of these phones , which I find significant but not a deal-breaker , is that , on occasion , an incoming call does n't register on one or both of the satellite bases , causing me to miss the call because the satellite base fails to ring ( still goes to the main base where the caller can leave a message though ) . Both bases are less than 30 feet away from the main unit , in opposite directions , but are usually behind closed doors . It 's not common , but in the year or two that I 've had these phones , it 's happened at least a half dozen times that I know of . Usually I 'm within earshot of the primary receiver , so I do n't know exactly how often it may occur . It 's probably relevant to note that my previous Panasonic phone set was the same way and thus it could also be related to where one of the bases is kept ( on the floor in a dedicated HT with insulated walls for sound control ) . All the other phones I 've used have only had a single base , so I ca n't offer any conjecture as to whether it may be normal for multiple base units or a problem unique to Panasonic . But since it 's not too consistent , and I 'm not much of a phone talker , it 's been a fairly minor inconvenience . So far , none of the missed calls qualified as emergencies or were very important.For its sound quality and range , I 'd definately buy these phones again . Infact , I purchased a set for my sisters family at Christmas . Her husband is a minister , so between the two of them , they spend a lot of time with calls and seem very happy with these too.UPDATE : Having used these phones for quite awhile now , I would still repurchase them , or the newest incarnation of them . However , I find the sound quality so clean and clear I usually use the speaker phone feature when calling . It sounds clear and nobody I talk to can tell I have them on speaker when asked . Each handset has a speaker phone option on the handset itself . That said , when using speaker phone , the sound tends to go in an out on all three phones as you move around , depending on how they 're held . If you hold them still , or set the phone on a desk , the sound stays constant , but sometimes if you tilt your hand a little while holding one of the phones the sound fades to a nearly inaudible whisper . The mic seems to still receive fine ; this only appears to affect the speakers output . It 's not a deal breaker . You just have to be more conscious of how you 're holding the handset at times , but it 's still a bit annoying and , I suspect , something that Panasonic should be able to easily fix in production . Hopefully they have with newer models .	-1
This phone does not work well . It 's so frustrating . I hate that I trashed the box . It seemed fine for a few months . Then the erratic behavior began . The most frustrating is when it simply will not allow you to make a call . I press the `` talk '' button and the screen goes blank . The batteries are fine , but it insists of giving me the message that I am not connected to the base . Yet , I 'm standing right next to it . I purchased it because we have 4 floor and no intercom . I have had other Panasonic products and was confident in the brand . This phone set is a disappointment .	-1
I `` upgraded '' from theUniden TRU-8885 3HS Cordless Speakerphone 5.8GHzthinking that the Panasonic phone system would clear up occasional interference from other wireless devices . Unfortunately , the Panasonic system is a major step down from the much older Uniden system . Voice quality is mostly very bad , even when standing next to the phone base . The menu system is cumbersome to navigate and get voice messages . As a comparison , the Uniden had a single button to obtain voice messages ; the Panasonic requires three clicks through the menu system . The caller ID is far to slow to display or verbally announce callers . Overall , I 'm very dissatisfied with this purchase .	-1
First , I love the tropical photo on the mouse pad ! ! but that 's all the good stuff ... The wrist gel while it was comfortable and soft , it is n't high enough . It needs to be about 25 % higher in my opinion . the other drawback is that the mouse pad narrows down near the wrist gel area . In my opinion it should n't do this it needs to be wide from top to bottom . This mouse pad is very narrow compared to 3 of my other pads . There just is n't enough working space on it being its narrow.Almost a great all in one mouse pad but too narrow and needs a little more height in the gel.Update 11-1-11Although its mot my favorite mousepad , i 've still ben using it but now it had developed a bubble in the center and is no longer flat . I 've had to use double sided tape to keep it down otherwise my mouse does n't glide . It gets stuck on the bubble .	-1
Normally I LOVE 3M products . They usually work exactly as advertised and are of the highest quality . THese laminating sheets , not so much . They 're OK , but the finished result is amateurish and not suitable for presentation . If you wan to protect a recipe ort some such thing from spills then they 're fine , but if you need something ot appear laminated , this won ; t really do it . The sheets are ever so slightly hazy , and trap air bubbles , no matter how much squeeze ou . I even tried a heavy rubber roller I have from my art school days , but it did n't help much . I almost feel guilty top give a 3M product a less-than-stellar review , but this is a ( fortunately rare ) example of a miss on their part . Make sure it 's suitable for your needs before you buy these sheets .	-1
Honestly , I ordered these from Vine by mistake . I saw `` laminating sheets '' and just blindly clicked because I was excited to be able to order something to use in my newScotch Thermal Laminator . Unfortunately , I completely missed the `` SELF SEAL '' graphic on the front . I really think `` self seal '' should be in the listing title.Anyway.After testing these on small insignificant things like magazine pages ( for cut out recipes ) and Lego Minifigure checklists ( which are folded and tend to get ripped a lot ) before trying something I did n't want to ruin ... I came to the conclusion that I 'd just rather use my thermal laminator . Trying to get a good-looking application is kind of like attempting to put on an iPhone screen protector ... you need to do it with no wind , no fuzzies floating around , and perfectly stable finger work and then it still is n't quite right . Of course , you do n't need medical precision to laminate a recipe , but for the anal retentive person ( like me ) it just did n't look and feel how I wanted it to . Plus it feels somewhat flimsy.If you do a lot of laminating , I 'd seriously consider a thermal one . Otherwise , if you really want something laminated , I 'd just go to your local office supply store and pay the $ 1.29 a page .	-1
This is no replacement for a laminating machine . If you are laminating an 8.5x11 inch document ( printer paper size ) it is quite frustrating and not perfect in the least bit.In order to laminate , you must first peel the backing off one laminating sheet ( made easy by arrows and tabs ) and lay your paper on top . Then you must peel the backing off a second laminating sheet and try desperately to make the two sheets match up perfectly while the sheet curls and tries to cling ( perhaps static draws them together so quickly ) . As far as I am concerned , getting them to line up is impossible . I was not able to do so but got it pretty close one time . If you do mess the aligning up really badly and recognize it before the two sheets are about 1/2 way together and pull the sheet off it will take the ink off your document and the ink/typing will stick to the laminating sheet.I would only recommend if you need to laminate one or two things a year and the machine would take up unnecessary space in your house . It may also be ok to use if you are laminating smaller items so you can trim off the pieces where the laminating sheets do n't align .	-1
They did n't work that great and it drove me to make the decision to buy a home laminator . The machines are small and are n't that expensive these days . I do n't think you can do a good job without heat and without it being a pouch .	-1
This stapler broke within the first few times of use . I tried to staple 10 pages and it started to jam and misfeed the staples . Then it could n't even staple a single piece of paper properly.In my search for another mini-stapler , I purchased theSwingline Tot Staplerwhich has a much more solid stapling mechanism , is smaller , and actually works .	-1
I am surprised that so many people like this stapler . It works fine as a stapler but it is so loud that I could never take it to a meeting or class . It is so loud that it scares my dog everytime I use it . I ca n't wait to get rid of it !	-1
I bought these twice because I like the capacity - about a half inch . But they come flat with scoring ( more or less ) for you to fold for expansion . Establishing the expansion requires three folds each on each side and the bottom . Three folds each because you have to fold the sides and the middle of the expansion . The first time it was a nuisance and was quite time-consuming but the effort was acceptable if you have patience.The second time , the scoring on the sides was weak and the scoring at the bottom was all but non-existent . At the sides of the bottom I could barely see scoring but it was not helpful for folding at all . There was no scoring at all in the middle of the bottom expansion . It was like a physical puzzle and took so much time I asked a friend for help . She could not see any scoring at all for the bottom fold . As a result the expansion at the bottom is uneven and nowhere as clean as it was the first time.I am disappointed because they looked very good the first time and the manila is reasonable sturdy .	-1
These folders are flimsy and hard to expand without tearing . The colors are very dull . I would not buy again !	-1
This wrist pad 's profile is MUCH too high . I kept it because it is comfortable , but they need to reduce the height . Also , they have `` anti-slip '' material on the bottom which works very well . But it attracts all the dust and debris and has to be wiped off daily .	-1
At 8-3/4 '' in length the mousepad already seems small . Then consider the wrist rest takes up two inches , leaving less than seven inches of space to work with . My hand , from where the wrist bends to the end of my middle finger is eight inches in length so my hand hangs over the mousepad slightly , and so does the mouse.To give you additional perspective , I use anEvoluentand Logitech MX Revolution mouse . Placed side by side , the two mice barely fit the width of the pad . Moving the cursor upward is not only slightly uncomfortable because my fingers hang over the edge , but the dropoff will cause my cursor to track incorrectly . If you keep your movement settings maxed out where very little movement is needed to send your cursor from one side of the screen to the other , then this mousepad may be acceptable . Still , only small hands need apply .	-1
I got this mouse pad to replace one that slipped around on my desk too much . Well , this one does n't move around , that 's true , but the wrist rest is way too hard to be comfortable . I pictured something a little cushy , but this is truly as hard as a rock . I like the idea of the antimicrobial protection , but it 's not worth the discomfort .	-1
I 'm a writer and photographer , so I 'm on my computer a large percentage of the day . When I 'm writing I do n't need my mouse as much , but when I 'm editing photos it 's all about the clicking . I 've even had sore fingers from clicking before , which is definitely something that 's annoying . I had the opportunity to try out this wrist rest and was excited for it . I hoped that it would help me to use my mouse with less pain.While the wrist rest part works well , I do not like the mouse pad itself . The pad is very scratchy , so when you move your mouse around it just is a scratchy , grating feeling . It 's definitely something that is really annoying for me . I prefer a smooth surface to use my mouse on.I 'm definitely not going to be using this mouse pad any time soon . I also reviewed the3M Gel Wrist Rest , Black Leatherette , 7 Inch Length , Antimicrobial Product Protection ( WR305LE ) , and that is much more comfortable with no scratchy feeling because I can use whatever mouse pad I want to with it .	-1
I got this 3M foam mouse pad 2 days ago and I 'm sorry to report that I have nothing good to say about it . Okay , maybe the fact that it does n't slip would be considered a positive , but it ends there . The mouse pad is sooo uncomfortable to me . The pad part which is supposed to support your wrist is rock hard , I 'm not kidding . I can not use this mouse pad for longer than 10 minutes as my hand goes numb . Time to reorder a different one ... Stay away !	-1
I 'm sorry to say the product did not work for me too long , from the start the foam was attracting debris like some sort of lint catcher in a dryer . Even the bottom of the unit attracted debris , I started to wonder if what I actually needed was an Air Purifier . It was as if this foam pad was an attractant to anything ! ! ! It did provide good wrist support , while I went without one it was a noticeable difference . So , it would have been great if not for the foam aspect .	-1
I have been using a gel-type wrist rest from another brand that starts with an F. Seeing this 3M foam wrist rest on Amazon Vine , I thought why not give it a try . Well , I can agree that this is a comfortable wrist rest , and I do n't even detect any strong smell unless I stick my nose to the wrist rest 's surface . However , I find this foam wrist rest to be inferior to my gel wrist rest on one important count : cleanliness . With the gel wrist rest , all I need is to wipe it with a damp cloth , and the non-permeable surface is clean as new . But this form wrist rest has a cloth surface , which is permeable . Yes , it has been treated with an antimicrobial agent and perhaps nothing can grow on it . But it does not follow that we do n't have to clean the surface . This wrist rest attracts lint and other small dirt like magnet , and thanks to its black color , the dirt is very visible . Needless to say , I am switching back to my gel wrist rest .	-1
I would have given this three stars , due to the font and tape limitations , but the fact that it can take up to 5 minutes to peel a lable , using it 's useless built in tape peeling assistance `` tool '' . Best to use an exacto knife ... just be careful if you are ill-informed enough to buy ANY Brother P-touch . Prepare for ultimate frustration	-1
I got this binder through the Amazon Vine program , so I did n't have to pay for it . However , to people who are thinking of purchasing it with their hard-earned money , I can only say that it is not worth it . I see absolutely nothing in this binder to justify the $ 11.75 price . It looks quite cheap , so you wo n't impress your clients or business partners with it . They will think you picked it up for a buck at a dollar store somewhere . The cover is a bit puckered right from the start , from the very moment when you unwrap it . With use ( and I 'm talking about really moderate use here ) , the puckering gets worse.On the positive side , the binder has a very good mechanism that opens and snaps closed the rings . This is a useful feature that other binders lack . However , this great and useful characteristic is not enough to justify the price and make up for the poor look of the binder . I hope that the makers of this product start inserting the great locking mechanism into better-looking and cheaper binders . Until then , I will not be purchasing this product .	-1
The first thing I did upon receiving this Wilson Jones Premium Binder is insert a few of my favorite and necessary sheet protectors . I was disappointed that the WJ binder does NOT accommodate them . The longer aspect of the metal D-ring causes the protectors to stick out of the side of the binder by 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch - not at all good for important documents.Plus , if there are only a few protectors in the binder , they tilt out the bottom if you hold the binder upright ( as you would need to when placing the binder on a bookshelf or other flat surface ) . NOT GOOD.In its favor , however , are the facts that this is PVC free , claims not to transfer inks and print from your documents onto the inside surface of the binder , and the corners are rounded off ( which may improve shelf wear ) .But this WJ Binder will never replace my favorite , which isAvery Protect and Store View Binders with 1 Inch EZ-Turn Ring , White ( 23000 ) .	-1
Yes , the window for writing or sticking labels is larger , because the cut-away portion of the front of the folder is larger . However , when a normal-sized piece of paper is placed inside the folder , any extra writing space is covered by the paper . When I put my regular folders next to one of these , both with paper in them , I have exactly the same amount of space to write a heading on the tab.Otherwise , these are perfectly great folders for normal use . They just do n't have more space to write in , as they claim . Two stars because I can still use them , but their claims are false .	-1
I was looking for a color that evokes a feeling of Autumn time , so I went into my local stationary store , and although the selection was n't huge , this was one of the colors that struck me . Although the name of the color did n't describe my intentions , the color swatch assured me this was the right choice . Loaded it up in my Lamy Safari with a fine nib and the ink would not even stop skipping long enough to complete a word . Tried on several different papers including a Moleskine and Bristol Board , still nothing . Beautiful color , just refuses to start or stay started with writing . Unfortunately , not a very reliable ink .	-1
Item came damaged because it was n't in a properly sized package . It was crammed into a box that was too small to hold it and thus was bent .	-1
This was great at first , but then stopped sharpening pencils completely . Very frustrating for students , and causes students to run the sharpener for extended periods of time thus disrupting class . There 's a warranty , but I 'm not sure it 's worth the shipping costs , so I 'm going to throw the thing out .	-1
Well here it is , not even a month later and the sharpener no longer works . Let 's see how long it takes to replace it.and now 2 weeks later , I have replaced it myself with ax XACTO School ProAnd now they want me to package it up , pay to send it back ( use a bus to go to the PO ) and they are going to charge me ANOTHER handling fee.But the Xacto is working beautifully.Dianne Schuch Lindsey dlschuch at Salon.com ( Open Salon )	-1
I ordered this sharpener for my classroom based on the positive reviews it received . It lasted exactly 20 days in service . I would not buy this sharpener again nor would I recommend it to anyone .	-1
I have n't found one good electric sharpener yet . This is a piece of crap . It sharpens for a little while and then you ca n't use it anymore . Do n't waste your money on this . I purchased it for my 4th grade class and I only used it for about two months and that was it . It 's no good for heavy duty . Then I purchased a heavy duty one like this and that one was just as bad . They just do n't make any good sharpeners anymore .	-1
I bought this because of all the positive reviews on here but I was not impressed at all . Looks and feels like cheap paper . I was expecting high quality paper but was very disappointed .	-1
Worked for me but leaves black dots on every page , presumably a small scratch on the roller inside . Much cheaper than the Canon version so quality also suffers a bit -- I 've had minor issues with almost all of the aftermarket cartridges .	-1
Prepare for one very honest review ... 3M should think twice about charging ( what is tantamount to ) a king 's ransom for this potential doorstop.Pros : Honestly , none that I can find . ( And , I usually can find SOMETHING positive to note about a product ) .Cons : Installation was a nightmare . I originally ordered this for the desk in my office . However , once I received the astonishingly weighty tray ( over sixteen pounds ) , I realized that I would have to drill sizable holes in one fairly expensive desk . Rather than nervously bore holes through a valuable piece of cherry , I decided to first experiment with it on a less pricey piece . And , thank goodness for that ! Not only was installation a struggle ( I needed an extra person to help me ) , but the end results was far from ergonomic . At first , I just assumed that I would have to `` get used to '' it ( maybe years of ingrained , bad habits would have to be broken ) . Turns out , this was just painful and bizarre . No matter how I altered the product , it was just awkward . And , `` awkward '' soon translated to aches . Perhaps 3M needs to reexamine their design ... perhaps it 's just a problem with me.If you were considering this on a whim , I vote that you skip it . If you came here because you are dead-set on buying this , maybe you will have better luck . ( And , with these new reviews posted here , you will have a clearer idea of the potential drawbacks ) .	-1
This keyboard tray is very solidly constructed , heavy , but a bit awkward to use . I found it hard to install and the design of the product was not ergonomic ( at least for me ) . I decided I was better off without it . Pass on this item , you can find something better designed and easier to use .	-1
The keyboard tray arrived at my house in a very large box , weighing nearly 20 lbs . After dragging it in and unpacking , I found that the majority of the package was taken up by a clunky wooden board - the tray.For the nearly $ 140 3M charges for this tray , I felt that the quality was just not there and the instructions were terrible . It took me forever to figure out what goes where , and in the end , I was not willing to destroy my desk in order to use this product .	-1
Why HP feels the need to charge skyrocket prices for maybe 2 fl oz of ink amazes me . The ink produces great picture in my HP brand printer , but I constantly feel the urge to go with a cheaper option . However , HP claims this can damage the printer , and will not be under warranty ... You ca n't win !	-1

AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY ! The store named Best Buy claims to have a 30 return policy . I bought an HP printer from the so-called Best Buy store and I soon ran out of ink . I also had a terrible time with the HP printer . The HP printer had very little ink , it took forever too get the printer to start , it made a lot of noise when compared to other Brand named printers , it took a long time to print let alone shut down and it printed a test page that used up a great amount of INK without me directing it to . The HP printer also has very little INK that comes with the HP printer and when I purchased extra regular INK cartridges I ran out very soon . I found this out with HP printers ; very little INK . If you buy a regular HP ink cartridge you are buying what I call a sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly . If you think about it the HP cartridges that show 2.5 times more INK are the same size as the regular cartridges . You then have to ask , `` how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges '' ? I considered myself cheated when I bought the regular sized cartridge . My personal opinion is that the HP 2.5 times more INK cartridges run out after printing only about 50 % more than the regular overpriced HP INK cartridges while you end up paying a lot more.The only good thing about my experience with the Best Buy store is that I was able to try out the HP INK supply and the printers ' performance ! I could suggest doing the same but I wo n't . I will state that I was n't shy returning the HP printer to the Best Buy store because I was not afraid of this chain store and I was not satisfied with the performance of the HP Printer . Best Buy says you have 30 days to return the HP Printer you should have 30 days but this is a misnomer ! I tried the HP printer I bought from the Best Buy store and I did n't like its performance . The Best Buy store states that you can return it within 30 days for a full refund if you do n't like its performance . I took the Best Buy store for their word and I returned the HP printer to the Best Buy store after 25 days of use . The Best Buy store would not take the return without me signing a statement stating that I would not return anything I buy until after a 90-day period from the time I returned the HP Printer . I should have told them to F off and accept my return without signing their statement . The Best Buy store also wants a photo ID from everyone when they return something . If the item is being charged back to your credit card then you should not have too give them any ID ! This amounts too invasion of privacy ( Big Brother ) . AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY ! AMAZON DOES NOT ASK FOR A PHOTO ID ! My opinion is that the Best Buy store is not the BEST BUY ! I believe Amazon is the BEST BUY ! MY OPINION IS THAT Amazon does have the BEST BUY . Amazon is not like the so-called Best Buy store . It is my opinion that Amazon ALWAYS gives you the BEST BUY . I will stay committed to Amazon and quit buying from the so-called Best Buy store . Amazon has fantastic delivery , great service , in most states no tax , in most cases free shipping , extended warranties are available and Amazon will take care of any problems immediately , unlike the so-called Best Buy store !	-1
I sent the tray back . It was to be a set of 6 stacking trays . Only 1 tray was in the box . Really ? If the missing 5 trays were included It would have been ideal .	-1
JUNK PLASTIC , WHICH IS MADE FLUMSY . NEVER SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SUCH A THING . SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET SOMETHING THAT WOULD STAY TOGETHER .	-1
I honestly do know understand how this chair could get a 4 start rating on average . The chair is properly shaped and does support your back , but it is too firm for my taste . The quality is SO SO . My package was brand new and it was missing some of the packing material and the base had minor but noticeable scratches . I really dont care about these scratches , but it does show the craftsmanship and built quality of the item . Most likely I am going to return this item .	-1
It 's junk . It 's nothing like what the ad describes . The picture might look pretty good , but there is a lot of plastic in this chair that can break . The one I ordered was dead on arrival with a broken right armrest . I saw no noticeable damage on the box . So I know what happened is that the box got bounced . That 's all it took to break the plastic armrest . The armrest is really a loop of plastic that is held onto the chair by one bolt . The right armrest broke all the way through exactly where the bolt was ! Of course , that 's where the stress would be from a bounce . The point is , it should n't have broken . And the inconvenience and cheapness of this thing will keep me from ever ordering another one .	-1
I love Amazon , but I am never ever buying a chair from them again . Why , because these things are a pain in the butt to return once assembled . I got this chair on December 16 2013 . Today is March 5th . - that 's TWO AND A HALF MONTHS . The cheap leather wannabe is now torn in two different places , and the chair is not as comfortable as you think it will be . It 's kind of hard to explain , but it feels like I am falling forward , and not by design to promote good posture . As soon as you lean back , your butt moves forward . Height wise , it was no problem , but when moving around , it sounds like cranky old metal . I 'm guessing by the summer , this will start losing its hydraulic , too . I paid $ 149.00 . No , it 's not an expensive chair , but come on , two and a half months ? Two words : Rip Off	-1
not the greatest desk , and dissapointed i overpaid . does the job but doesnt feel quality . Legs are not steel , they are light aluminum ... which is ok if you like that , but it makes the desk less stable and does n't give the bulk sturdy feel.the glass is good , but other then that , do n't pay more than 100 for this desk . i would return it but too much a hastle.also , keyboard tray is too close to the desk ... you ca n't type on a keyboard unless you slide it out ( not good for people who can type without looking at the keys ) . i have a slim keyboard too and still no room .	-1
The desk is sturdy , now that it 's built . That 's the most important part.Here 's the problem - the quality control is horrendous . One of the pieces I got had the holes drilled in the wrong spots . No , not a mistake I made , they 're all supposed to be identical , and this one piece was not . The hole was offset by a good half an inch.So , I contacted the company 's support . I gave them the model of the desk , the letter of the piece needed , and a description of the piece and what was wrong with it . They asked for pictures . OK , no problem . I took pictures and emailed them over . They got the pictures , and replied stating that they would get the new part shipped to me.In the mean-time , I did n't have time to wait for a part , so I re-drilled the existing piece , and assembled the desk . It would n't be much more than a 15-minute job to replace the piece with the new one later . Good thing I decided to do that , as here we are , 6 months later , and I still do n't have the part ! I 've contacted them 4 times in regards to the part that was supposed to have already been shipped . The first time I contacted them to find out where it was , they wanted to start a new case . I went through that , and THAT 'S when they decided to tell me that they already have a case open , despite not being able to find it earlier ! Then they told me that it was scheduled to be shipped ... . called back a few weeks later , and they gave me the same line . Again , the two times after that . No amount of being nice or fuss would get anything else out of them , but I am still without the replacement part , which was originally 'scheduled to ship ' in late-September.So , yeah - customer service sucks . If you buy the desk , cross your fingers that you do n't have any issues !	-1
HORRIBLE ! ! ! Terrible experience and I am literally crying now , because I could not afford to lose $ 142 . First of all , it arrived defective as in MOST of the screw holes were not threaded . We contacted the manufacturer and replacement parts were shipped out - THEY TOO ARE DEFECTIVE ... however better . Only 2 of the screw holes were not threaded so I figured `` okay , I 'll have an unsteady desk.. I can live with this.. '' Nope . Now the glass -seriously - DOES NOT FIT ! One out of three pieces fit- the other two are TOO BIG and seriously -they do not fit . They can not sit down . The desk is NOT USABLE like this . I got it all put together prior to figuring this out ; obviously the glass goes on last . Which means I can not ship it . I am out $ 142 that I did not have.. I used xmas money to buy myself a much needed desk- I am a college student and I have back pain from hunching over laptops all day . I now have no xmas money , no new desk and a big defective heap . Seriously heartbroken about the situation ... -Screwed over pretty badly , Jessie R.I do NOT recommend this product or any others from this company . : ( : ( : (	-1
The printer had been purchased as a replacement for a 20-year old HP Laserjet III . My expectations of the new printer had been tempered ; however , the product proved more disappointing than I could bear . The unit was of flimsy build quality . Print quality was poor . There were numerous stray streeks on the printed pages . HP 's once legendary service branch was of no help.I exchanged the printer for a Xerox 6130 -- WOW , what a difference ! ! I 've been burned enough times with HP products during the last few years that it comes easy to write that this printer may well have been my last HP purchase .	-1
This is a terrible product . Here are the problems we 've had with it : - Frequent paper jams in both the paper and scanner feed- Frequently says it 's out of paper when it 's not- Sometimes it gives an error while scanning or starts scanning and then never finishes- The feature that is supposed to smartly detect photo borders when scanning multiple photos often does n't work- Confusing and annoying software with too many popups and murky choices- After changing the ink and aligning , it keeps showing the message asking you to align anyway- Confusing front panel that makes you select `` Scan Color '' first , even if you want to scan in B & W ; I know HP can make good products , but you have to pay for them . We also have a more expensive but similar HP which works fine and has much simpler and better software .	-1
The first printer I received had a paper feed problem ( not in the auto feeder , from the paper tray ) . The second replacement printer HP sent will not print color for some reason and I 've tried everything . This printer is extremely low end , hence the low price . It 's operation and materials are of low quality . So far I 've invested three hours attending to HP 's problems with their defective printer . In order to get a replacement , you have to walk through their phone instructions . You then have to repackage their printer for return and drop it off to a FedEx location . I will never buy another HP low end printer as long as I live and certainly only from a distributor that excepts returns . Buying this was a huge mistake . **Update** it prints a simple pdf page with simple black text at 2 minutes per page . Beware , this printer should be free to consumers because of what HP makes on its cartridges .	-1

I bought used cartridges , and my printer would n't recognize them . They were in a different brand packaging . Wasted my money when I could have paid a few more bucks to get the real thing . Yes , HP cartridges do n't last long .	-1
Today 's inkjet and deskjet printers are JUNK and deliberately designed to make the customer pay for them over and over again in INK COSTS ! ! Do yourself a HUGE favor - > if your at this page thinking of buying this ink , yeah it 's probably the best one for your money ... but what 's so much better is if you please consider investing in a cost effective and inexpensive LASER PRINTER that suits your needs and will end up paying for itself so you NEVER need to be here again buying this ! ! There is a decent selection here at Amazon - > Make a WISE choice by at least taking a look at what 's available before buying more inkjet INK again and AGAIN ! ! !	-1
I would not suggest ordering this item from `` Linkyo '' ( SuperMediaStore.com ) folks . They will deliver within the time THEY specify but believe me it could be days and days AFTER you have made your order . Product original HP packaging and quality but I found no savings from ordering from this company so while waiting for their item I did what I should have done in the first place ... ..I went to WalMart and bought it for the same price but got it instantly ! Sheesh can I be dumb sometimes !	-1
Perhaps I got a dud of a cartridge . After only 30 sheets ( of text ) it was printing like it had no ink . I tried everything and still no luck . After I replaced the ink it was printing fine .	-1
Having purchased an HP 4500 officejet a while back I also picked up some ink for it . 901 color and 2 - 901 black cartridges ( family does a lot of B & W ; printing ) I am not impressed at all with the 901 black . It is substandard at best and produces very mixed results.Usually we print stuff on FAST ( economy ) and while the cartridge is rated for 200 pages , we actually got around 250-300 on the first one which puts it at around 125-150 for Normal . ( Usually fast/economy uses half the ink as it only does a single pass instead of two or three ) The strange part is.. the second cartridge we got was terrible performance . I estimate by around 150 Fast/Economy the cartridge was starting to show it was almost out of ink already which would put it at around 75-100 pages normal ! ? I was a bit shocked because there was such a deviation . I did some research and found out that HP rates their Cartridges using an ISO standard Text document . They test on a J4580 printer which is an INK SAVER printer . If you do not own a J4580 then obviously you will get different results.Because it is rated on a Text document keep in mind , print out a page that is loaded with black bars ( like a bar graph ) it will devour your ink ; yet print out a page that has only a small amount of text you could go for 300+ pages easily . I rarely complain about ink cartridges but I must say HP really should put some more ink into the standard 901 black ; considering a 901XL has over 3x the rating ( 200 vs 700 ) . Plus they should rate them using a `` Standard '' printer not an Ink Saver printer . VERY MISLEADING ! ! OVERALLAvoid the 901 black ! ! While they perform just fine and do have black ink in it that works , the cartridges performance is determined by how much black you print per page not by # of pages . I would recommend instead spending the extra money and getting the 901XL black which is rated for 700 pages . Once I got one of those I found I was able to print an entire ream of paper ( 500 pages ) and the cartridge was still 50 % full ( all on economy/fast ) So despite paying twice the price I already DOUBLED my output compared to a 901 standardIn short.. avoid ! ! get the 901XL as it will pay for itself .	-1
WIFI connection is tedious and time consuming to set up - and often the printer has to be recycled several times just to find a router that is in the same room.Once the connection is set , connection has to be manually recreated every few hours - a 5 to 10 minute process . It loses the connection easily and it does NOT automatically recreate the connection like other wifi devices do . I have to reset the machine to `` default settings '' and start from scratch.None of my other wifi devices have this problem . They all find the router easily and if they lose it , they find it automatically , let alone having to begin from scratch.I have spent time with their technical support on the telephone , numerous times , who confirmed that this is NORMAL behavior . Also , my router is very reliable when it comes to other devices . Even guests visiting with devices have no trouble using the wifi.The Brother machine seems to use its own proprietary approach to wireless and therein lies a problem . That is , you have to load special software onto every machine that will print wireless . So do n't expect guests with computers using your wifi to easily print from their computers via wifi unless you invest the time to load the software.The user interface for other functions is very kludgey and unreliable . I often have trouble getting this thing just to make a copy . Seriously.Overall I feel that I wasted $ 300 and a lot of time . You know , I research so carefully before I buy ; I read reviews , make comparisons , and review product literature . Buying this piece - particularly for the purpose of printing wireless - was a VERY bad move.PS : If you check my history of Amazon reviews , I think you will find it is rare that I am as unhappy with a product let alone furious as I am with this one and this company . I will not buy from this company again and I will strongly recommend that friends and family avoid products by the Brother Company .	-1
For years I used a massive duplex HP that was built like a tank and the print quality was superb . The downsides were , it 's size , it was n't wireless and the print cylinders were very expensive . I have always been impressed with the value Brother products offered and so after much research and especially the comments of Amazon buyers , I purchased this model . The footprint is acceptable though not tiny , the construction seemed somewhat cheap but for the price reasonable , the multifunctions were promising but most of all was the promise of being wireless and without the need of being perched on the desk . After a few months of use I can say now that it was a monumental disappointment on almost all counts . The print quality is barely acceptable . The scanning seems to work only marginally well . To print an envelope you open a slot in the front the size of a toaster slot and the envelope is fed straight through and is spit out the back . Obviously not meant to set up in front of a wall . But by far the worst attribute is the functioning of the wireless feature . I have spent so many wasted hours trying to configure it but it has trouble even detecting the SSID signal , then it loses the connection almost immediately . I have changed to every possible security configuration including WEP , WPA . WPA2 and so on . Occasionally the setup accepts the settings and I feel like I discovered cold fusion . I print something only to be told a minute later the computer ca n't find the printer . I scream , `` it 's 3 feet away in clear view ! '' . Many seem satisfied with this printer . But I 've conceded it 's time to drag the HP out of the attic and learn to live with a wired connection but great print quality and flawless functions .	-1
What I like about this mouse pad : - it has a non-slip back- it 's pretty ; especially for a young girl- the mouse moves easily over the surfaceThe mouse pad area is about 25 % too small but I suspect that is because this seems to be a child 's mousepad.What I really do n't like and the reason I rated this 2 stars is because the gel pad is too hard and actually hurts my wrist . I tried moving my right wrist and arm along the pad in several positions but that did n't help . In fact I was in pain after using this for 30 minutes . If it were n't for this issue for me , I would have rated this 5 stars .	-1
I thought I would use this for my laptop and liked the way that it could just be placed on top of it while not in use . I found the surface to be just too sensitive for me , I could not hold the mouse steady . This could be because I am used to the standard type of mouse pad , so I did use it for a week to see if it got any easier , but it did n't . I ended up giving it to my husband to use at his desk , and he seems to like it just fine . Now I have some residue on the top of my laptop cover that I have not been able to remove so far . Not real thrilled about that especially since the box that the mouse pad comes in shows a picture of that being how to store it .	-1
The basics : Textured plastic surface ( probably to aid old-school ball mice to track ) with a Post-It-type glue back to hold in place either on your desk or on the top of your laptop when you 're on the go.My reaction : I do not like the feel of the textured surface . It irritated my hand as I used the mouse . My optical mouse did not like the pattern on the surface , and the cursor would jump occasionally . Not very useful . I get better results just using the mouse on the table top .	-1
Other purchasers may have been luckier than myself , but I sent this back for a refund . It did not work as advertised , other than it did indeed stick/restick , as mentioned in the description . But it did not give a smoother `` mousing '' experience . I placed the 'pad ' directly on my computer desk ( which is really a long conference table with a hutch so I could turn it into a 'computer desk ' of sorts ) surface . Unfortunately , my mouse ( an optical Hewlett Packard precision laser tracking mouse ) skipped all over the place . I had greater success with mouse/cursor movement placing the mouse directly ON the table surface . I also did not get extended battery life , as , ironically , I had to put in new batteries about 2 weeks ( ? ) after it arrived in the mail , lol . So IMO , if you are looking for a better alternative to a foam mouse pad/smoother mousing experience , I would not personally recommend the 3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface . It did not live up to its advertising . ( But as always , the return process with amazon.com was a breeeze . )	-1
I bought and tested this using my Logitech M325 optical mouse . I use my mouse for regular things and I am not a graphic designer or someone who needs ultra fine pixel movements.That said , I lasted 15 minutes on this mousepad , then swapped back to my old felt/cloth surface one . Even after adjusting all the sensitivity settings in the control panel , it just tracks very tightly to every slight movement you make with the mouse and hence results in choppy unfluid movements . I think if I were determined to use for a week , I could probably learn to compensate for the added sensitivity but then I 'd never be able to go back to using a regular mousepad.I 'm sure that this mousepad makes sense for some users , either using it for industrial or creative work , but I do n't recommend it for normal everyday laptop or PC use .	-1
these are decent - not decent enough to justify the price of them considering the weight of the paper being used in the pads . They are nothing special and the paper is very sheer and lightweight . This would n't be a problem if they were not charging a premium price for sub par paper writing pads .	-1
At first , I liked this pen very much . But it leaked ink on a nice dress shirt , ruining it . Apparently , they can not put liquid ink in a retractable pen like this without some of the pens leaking . Bummer , not only because of the ruined shirt but also because I liked the way the pen worked .	-1
This will work for a short time , after which you can tap , pound , plead , jiggle and anything else you can think of , and nothing will come out of it . I just tossed the two that I purchased . A waste of money .	-1
It seems funny to review a cheap pen like this . However , every time I pick it up to use it irritates me . These pens are fat which I do n't like . They have a really wide tip , again , which I do n't like . They do not skip but every day I have go through this ordeal to get it to write . As long as I 'm writing something every few hours it will be OK . The ink is permanent ink , which I do like.Basically , I 'm just disappointed in Paper Mate . I have a PM pen in my wallet that I have been using for probably 25 years . It 's the perfect refillable pen and of course ( 1 ) you ca n't buy them any more , and ( 2 ) it was made in the USA.These little cheap crappy pens are just not for me .	-1
Love the lamination ! Scotch is the best and they know it cause they charge too much . It 's not worth twenty words in a review . If you can find it cheaper somewhere , let me know .	-1
Your comment could n't be more true . I hope someone gets a Class Action lawsuit going to stop HP madness . Their INK cartridge information is n't nearly correct . Look at Epson and the Class Action lawsuit they had to settle due to false claims . Thanks for confirming what I thought was HP hype . When you buy the 2.5 times longer ink cartridge and the cartridge is the same size as the regular ink cartridge you have too ask yourself why is it the same size ? Then you think again about the regular sized ink cartridge taking up the same amount of space as the XL cartridge and it all adds up . The regular size is what I call a `` SAMPLE PACK '' which may be the same amount you get when you buy the HP printer and find out you got only a SAMPLE PACK ! ! ! ! ! RUN FOREST , RUN AWAY FROM HP .	-1
I usually purchase my ink cartridges directly from HP . I will certainly do that in the future . It may have been retailer packaging but these cartridges have n't worked since I put them in . I get an error messages from my printer , it shows the ink levels almost gone when I 've only printed 4-5 items ( most of which were my test/clean printheads pages ) , and when I try to print , the color is streaked and very faint . Even a diagnostic or clean printheads wo n't print correctly . I wasted $ 26 and will have to purchase these cartridges again ( from HP this time ) in order to use this printer ! Would not recommend anyone purchase from this seller . Substandard product .	-1
As I mentioned in some of my other reviews , I hate ordering printer ink . It 's a huge scam . This tri-color pack is no different . If you print color at all you will burn through these cartridges in no time .	-1
The printers for this type of ink are the worst of the worst . The new ink cartridges are like sample cartridges . I would stay away from HP like the plague . If you want a `` sexually transmitted disease '' or `` pound a nail in your head '' I would go for it but I would rather do that than keep paying for HP Ink . HP is living off an old reputation . I have an `` HP Photosmart Premium eAll in One '' printer with two drawers . I print primarily on a setting of `` Plain paper , fast draft , Black '' with most of my printing done on 3 1/2 '' shipping labels that have only mailing and return addresses on them . I use the same setting while printing on standard letter paper . This type of setting is perfect for what I do . I printed only 264 - 8 1/2 '' x 11 '' pages with the above settings , 1,354 3 1/2 x 5 shipping labels with the above settings and I used color on only 3 - 4X6 '' photos . My color ink is exhausted after using the original ink that came with the printer and a complete set of 5 new printer inks ( Photo Black , Black XL and C , Y , M . I asked HP why did the color deplete and their comment was that I am getting a false report from my printer yet they can not explain why my printer wo n't print because I am out of C , M , Y and standard XL Black . I had to replace the Photo Black twice ! What is going on with HP ? My opinion is HP is putting starter ink in all of the over priced new cartridges . HP : STOP THIS MADNESS AND TREAT THE CONSUMER LIKE A HUMAN AND NOT LIKE A PRODUCT ! ! ! ! ! START TREATING US WITH RESPECT AND YOU WILL NOT GET COMMENTS LIKE THIS . Epson has far surpassed HP in quality and Ink retention .	-1
HP has really raised the level with the printer ink scam . They must play golf with the corporate executives who work in the men 's razor blade industry . My HP printer has a lot of great features but aside from having terrible drivers , it runs out of ink FAST and I only print occasionally . The older HP printer I had previously was alright and had ink cartridges that lasted many months with the same usage as with my new printer.So , now we basically have to buy their XL cartridges to get the same life as their previous `` standard '' cartridges , all for a much higher price than before , and they package new printers with cartridges that are ultra low on ink and assume we 're all just dumb hicks who wo n't notice.No more HP printers after this one .	-1
Item came from `` Ink EXPRESS '' , the product indicated that it was sold in the retail packaging , including a picture of same . When I received the item it was enclosed in bubble wrap , NOT retail packaging .	-1
HP has informed me there not real ink tanks , there refilled and used for displays in stores , there retail ! ! with a short time use and can jam damage your hp printer , hp will not cover any damages from useing this and many wont fit ! ! ! AMAZON NEEDS TO KNOW THE FACTS ! ! im not a dealer for amazon or HP , only a AMAZON CUSTMER-most of my printers are HP --	-1
More like 25-50 pages . This is so misleading and so frustrating . HP has got to come up with a better solution , I hate running out so frequently . I rarely print and the 10000 applications HP installed with my printer start forcefully reminding me to buy another cartridge within a week or two . ugghhhhh .	-1
It 's ink . It works well and lasts OK ( as long as you use it in time .. these things expire , in my view , a hugely cynical money making ploy from HP ) .As ink , it 's just fine . Good in fact . However , it sticks in the throat that this stuff is so expensive , so I ca n't give it more than a 2 because every time I purchase it , I 'm not happy.Conclusion , I buy this because I have to , not because I want to .	-1
HP - well I 've used their printers for some 20 years now - always good but they get you with the ink - they even admit on their website that they reduced the quantity what ever for ? ? ? Well to make even more money . They are not nice.Updatein going over my Amazon orders I noted that I got this product less than 6 months ago - a very short time considering I do not do that much printing . HP is a rip off especially as they do not allow remanufactured ink .	-1
I 've spent several hours trying to figure out why this printer wo n't show up on a list of printers for wireless connecting . What 's made this completely frustrating is how seemingly random and generic every HP support page or pdf is . A hour into troubleshooting seeing HP in the URL meant 'no useful information . ' ( I 've given up trying to use the school 's HP P2055dn , and purchased a Brother printer to use instead.I decided to stop wasting anymore time and give up when the tip was & # 34 ; look at page 80 & # 34 ; of a 144 page manual . If there 's a fix , I could n't find it .	-1
I had an Epson 2200 . I loved it . I upgraded to this . I hate it in every way.You have to swap out the ink from matte to glossy if you change paper types . It insists you do . There is no way around it ( There was on the 2200 ) . This means that every time I print on a DVD , I have to switch the ink . To do so , the printer primes itself and literally takes 7-10 % of the ink to do it . Then to switch it back there goes another 7 % . I have gone through so much ink I can hardly stand to look at it.Sorry Epson , but the jig is up . This swapping ink system is a scam.Just for kicks , here is the final straw that triggered this review : I had just printed a glossy b & W ; print . Then I needed to print a CD so I switched out the photo-black to the matte-black like a little monkey . As the printer primed the inks , it literally ran itself out the last 10 % of both magenta and light cyan . Now I ca n't print . I have to go to the store and buy more colored ink . Of course this is NUTS since I was only doing black and white prints.Yuck .	-1
This envelope is so stiff , that it is hard to access the folders . You have to use both hands to keep it open so you can get inside . It does n't stand up on it 's own , so you have to hold it while you try to hold the lid open to use it . It is easier to pull the folders out , in order to work with them . It is n't very practical to have to pull the folders out every time you want to access them . It does fit well in backpacks , like it advertises but I do n't think it is very easy access.If the above things bother you , I would suggest looking elsewhere for a better folder unit .	-1
i wanted to like this file folder . i use these types of folders a lot to sort school paperwork for my kids . i did n't like the shape or bulkiness of this one . it 's oddly shaped from any other file folder i 've used with the huge flap and the opening at the short side instead of the longer side . i may not use this as often because of this .	-1
I like the design idea here , I have a few different customer files that I 'd like to have quick access to , without having small things like business cards and CD 's falling out the sides of a regular folder , but the front flap on this portfolio is just annoyingly designed . First off , the plastic button that the elastic attaches too is big enough to get caught on things inside my top-load briefcase as I 'm trying to remove it or put it back . Secondly , the flap itself is made of a not-very-flexible plastic so I 'm fighting the thing every time I try to open it to get to the files . It wants to fold back down , or stick straight up , and wo n't fold over the back without a fight.It 's a good idea , but poorly realized in my opinion .	-1
This is my first disappointing experience with the Quartet brand . My combination board arrived with a large buckle in the magnetic whiteboard . I posted pictures on this product page . The glue separated . We tried to re-fit the white surface but could n't smooth it out.The buckle was n't just an aesthetic blemish . Quartet needs to adjust the amount or type of glue used on the magnetic whiteboard.I like the board 's size ( 30 '' x 18 '' ) and the combination utility with the cork board surface . The aluminum frame came with two mounting options ( clips and mounting pads ) for cubicles or walls.Overall , the board is of less-than-average quality , especially weighing the $ 74.99 list price and $ 46.99 Amazon price . I ca n't recommend this board at either of those prices.I do recommendQuartet ReWritables Mini Dry-Erase Markers , which I received at the same time as this board . I 'm using the markers with a different dry erase board.Rating : Two stars	-1
Large . Heavy . Good luck finding a space for it on your desk . I have it in a file cabinet and not using it .	-1
While I like my livescribe pens , I 'm not as satisfied with their ink refills . In theory they actually last a fairly long time ... as least the ink does . However the quality of the writing does not . When you first start to use one of these , it writes cleanly and smoothly . However this experience is short-lived . It is n't too long before those clean lines start to become inconsistent . Instead of the smooth feel you get at first , it becomes almost `` scratchy '' It seems like the little ball , or the parts that holds it , wears out prematurely . I end up having to switch to a new refill long before the ink runs out . Unfortunately you have to use their refills , so you 're stuck . Again , I like the pen , but the refill situation needs to be corrected . Given what they charge for these , the quality should be much higher .	-1
This plastic stand appears to be well constructed , but badly designed . If your computer happens to be the exact size , design , and weight distribution for which this unit is probably designed , then it might work for you.Mine is a little taller and narrower than the usual boxy CPU model ( A Dell XPS Studio ) but within the limits posted for the unit , it just sits there trying to balance , but there is space left over to either side . I selected it because my CPU has the ventilation on the sides and I needed a unit that did n't cover them up . The stand does not grip the sides , there is no lock mechanism to lock the width so it will hold on to the sides ( only the wheels lock ) . The CPU just balances on the base with no side support.My purpose for getting a stand is not to just raise the CPU off the floor , but to be able to move it back and forth under the desk when I need to check a connection.My previous metal stands made by Fellowes worked this way , but the high sides covered up the ventilation holes on this particular computer.Since this is just a suspension device that does n't really hold on to the unit , I feel uncomfortable putting my CPU on this unit and hope it does n't fall off .	-1
The first line of this item 's description reads `` Suitable for any size Notebook Computer '' . Nonsense , my 17 '' laptop slips and slides all over the plastic surface of this swivel pad . Only one side has the little gel nodules so you have to use that at the bottom or the swivel pad will slip and slide all over the place because laptops are not that heavy as opposed to televisions , speakers , etc . I 'm going to Home Depot now to see if I can find some more gel nodules to use on the top but this will likely elevate the height and at 0.8 '' , it already feels too high . In addition , the ball bearings they mention in the description , you would n't know they are there . It does n't spin that smoothly , particularly with only the weight of a laptop . Thumbs down for laptop use . *Added 2 weeks later*Ok I figured out how to use this product for a laptop . You need to buy some shelf grip liner from Target or Walmart - I paid $ 4.99 for a roll . Cut it to fit the top and bottom of the turntable and everything should hold into place quite nicely . Why they could n't design this more thoughtfully I do n't know but at least there is a fix .	-1
I got these due to the great reviews - what a mistake ! Every eraser in the box has broken right off the first time it was used , so we had to get cap erasers for them all . Also , they break often while being sharpened . Both of my kids also commented about how hard these pencils are to sharpen , so it 's not just me !	-1
First of all , when I was using this laminator for the first time , I was looking for the instructions/directions , and thought they were missing . This is my biggest complaint : I do n't know how to use this product properly due to the lack of instructions . Do I use cold or hot seal ? Is it better to use one or the other for different kinds of paper ? Why is there even a choice for hot or cold ? No information on this whatsoever.The first item I attempted to laminate was a ticket stub , which I wanted to use as a bookmark . I tried the hot setting first , and results were not exemplary . Did not laminate nice and flat , as I would have liked . Cold results are n't much better , so my advice ? Buy a different brand . Unless you are a professional laminator and know the `` ins and outs '' and finer points of laminating , this machine is not for you .	-1
What can you say about a paper clip really . Does it hold the paper yes , in my case my only issue is they leave a blackish dirt color on white paper as they where not washed before packing . Other than that , they are a good product in that they hold the paper . That 's really all one can say .	-1
`` 100 Count per Box , 10 boxes per order '' so you should get 1000 total paperclips . It is lying though . You only get 1 box of 100 paperclips .	-1
Smooth since the tip is so wide at 1.4mm.But , in my case , I feel like you have to press harder into the paper to get a good line . Otherwise the writing looks faded and skips .	-1
I bought the package of these pens and now I regret it more than I can say . Every single pen from that box bleeds ink . I get it on my hands and smears all over my paper . As I said it is each one because I wo n't use the one 's that leak , so I kept trying and not one did n't bleed . Would n't get it again.They had to go in the trash .	-1
I will not purchase this product again . It broke right away , due to my work schedule , I was not able to return earlier .	-1
The Photosmart is not as easy to assemble and use on a daily basis as might appear on the small thumbnail picture . It takes forever to print and I 've tried tweaking the printer . When you take a print out of a colored photograph , expect it to be limited because there was a greenish tinge to mine . It does n't come with a usb cable to attach to your computer so good luck with finding that small accessory . Also HP software takes forever to download..overall this is not a printer meant for an office and even for home use , I think it 's quite slow . The compartment for keeping the A4 sheets was slghtly comfortable . The best thing about it is the fact that I did n't need to pay for it and that 's not saying a lot . This now rests in the corner of my apartment and collects dust and newspapers . Takes about a minute to start processing a print out .	-1
Wrap it in plastic ! Make it last . But it wo n't last long outside in the elements . Works well . Costs too much .	-1
**UPDATE- Originally I gave this little guy 4 stars . But then , I got a wrinkle in between the two sheets of laminating film and now I ca n't get it to run smoothly . I am contacting customer support because I have wasted a ton of film trying to get it wrinkle-free again . I think the wrinkle happened when I removed a picture that was very slightly stuck to the film already and I wanted to readjust it . Anyway , once the wrinkle began , it would n't stop . The replacement cartridges are too expensive to waste the way this one is being wasted trying to fix this issue . So if you buy this laminator , be VERY careful if you try to pull something back out of it that you already started to put in . Literally , I had barely put it in , I did n't pull very hard either . ***Further Update : have stopped using this machine altogether . It repeatedly ruined documents and photos and I decided just not worth all of the effort for the lousy output .	-1
I actually happen to have a regular `` hot '' aka thermal laminator at home , so I was able to do a side by side comparison . My thermal laminator uses pouches up to legal size , which might limit its use as compared to a roll lamintor , but it 's never been an issue for me.Anyway ... The cost of purchasing a small to medium use thermal pouch laminator versus this heat free system is nearly the same . No substantial cost difference there . However , the cost of the laminate material they use is radically different . You could buy Three Hundred 9 '' x 11.5 '' pouches and One Hundred index card pouches , both in 5 mil ( the thick laminate material ) for the cost of One 90-foot roll of 5 mil laminate material for this heat-free system . ( A difference of about 200 feet of material . ) So , for cost effectiveness , this Scotch Heat-Free system is n't the way to go.Since you could potentially laminate something that was 17 feet long , this heat-free system does have a leg-up there.BUT , as nearly every other reviewer has noted , once you get a wrinkle in this heat-free system , it 's there for the rest of the roll . With pouches , if you get a wrinkle or an air bubble , run it again with a new pouch.And thermal systems have motors to pull the material through . With this system , you have to crank it . So unless you need to laminate things during a power outage , the convenience factor goes to thermal systems.I found this thing rather unfriendly to deal with . There are too many thing that you need to worry about : lining up the paper perfectly , watching for wrinkles , the laminate material sticking to the machine ... My personal experience with both systems makes a traditional hot laminator the clear winner .	-1
When I need to laminate small items , such as IDs and insurance cards , I take a piece of 2 '' clear packing tape and put it on both sides . I then use sissors to trim the `` laminated '' item.The LS960 uses a very similar method , but the `` tape '' is about 8.6 '' wide . Unfortunately , the rollers apply the laminate in an uneven manner , with bubbles or most often with severe wrinkles . I actually think that applying the laminate by hand , instead of using this machine , would do a better job.I ca n't give more than one star , because it does n't do what it claims to do .	-1
For years I have used clear packing tape to laminate tags and even whole sheets of paper , so I thought this item would be pretty useful . Wrong ! It 's so difficult to prevent bubbles , creases , and outright jams from occurring that I was better off with my roll of clear packing tape.I liked that it was electricity free because I could take it anywhere and not need to find an outlet , or bring an extension cord . It is a lot better smelling than the heat-type laminators . ( That melting plastic smell is awful in a closed office . ) But those are about the extent of the positives . It just does n't work very well . You feed your item to be laminated into the machine and start turning the roller ( which is on the wrong side of the machine for most of the right handed population ) . The tape cartridge has tape on the top and bottom which ( is supposed to ) evenly stick to your item and get pressed together by the rollers as it feeds through the machine . Heaven forbid there is a speck of dust , or animal hair , or lint , anywhere near the machine because I guarantee it will end up stuck between your freshly laminated document ! The thing is a dust magnet , and the tape cartridge is not well covered to keep it clean.Then , most of the time there will be air bubbles and creases in the finished product which you need to use your fingers or a cloth to try to smooth and press out . A pin hole stuck in the middle of an air bubble helps smooth it out . This is just too much effort for the finished product . And make sure you leave a 1/2 '' of extra tape on either end when you use the trimmer . Otherwise the tape starts to peel apart and the document is useless.If all of this was n't bad enough , the replacement tape cartridges cost nearly as much as the whole unit . Granted they give you a pretty generous 90 feet , but it 's still a big investment for a product that does n't really live up to it performance objectives.I would say stick with the heat laminators as they work a lot better than this dog .	-1
If I had actually paid for this , I would probably be pretty annoyed . Basically , it 's not so much a laminating machine as you 'd imagine one , and more a set of rollers that smooth contact paper over stuff . The main expense is n't the device itself , but rather the special contact paper you have to buy . And even with the rollers , the 'laminating ' process is tricky . It 's very easy to wind up with bubbles . Which -- it seems like if all your thing does is smooth contact paper over your thing-to-be-laminated , it should do that in a fairly foolproof manner .	-1
This is a terrible product . I was able to get the very first page to laminate correctly . But the laminating paper was barely wide enough to cover the paper . It left less than 0.1 inches of clearance on each side . After the very first page , every subsequent page came out crooked and not entirely laminated . I tried readjusting the paper guide and it did not help . Even though the paper lined up between the guide , every page still came out crooked with part of the paper outside the laminated area . If I had paid for this product I would return it immediately . Since I did n't , I 'm dumping it in the trash .	-1
I have had this thing for about an hour now and am sooooooo ready to throw it away . When I first opened the box I `` thought '' I was impressed with the quality feel of it 's build ... but soon learned it is just a thicker plastic crappy body versus thinner plastic . Most would think , `` Hey , thicker plastic ... sounds stronger '' ... .uh no , just more cumbersome and heavy for no reason because the doors and hinges are still fragile . The tray you see sticking out of the back is removable to make storing it a bit easier because you will want to store it . There are no doors or covers to close off the back of the unit , which is where you feed the paper object in you want to laminate ... .this is a stupid design because it leaves the laminating roll open to dust and whatever things are floating around in the air settling on your desk or wherever you store this ( think animal fur and dust balls ... .LOTS of them because this sucker is LOADED with static and will attract EVERYTHING that comes near it ) . The rear opening is just 2 layers of tape essentially that come together over your paper ... the sticky is all exposed in the rear and if it even catches the smallest hair or dust ... helllllllo permanent bubbles on your so-called laminated paper.Now , using this thing ... no heat , so no plug ( the only YAY for this thing ) . There is a handle on the LEFT side that you rotate slowly in a clockwise direction as you manually push your paper through the back . The idea is that those 2 sheets of tape will adhere on top & bottom of your paper and pop out the front looking all laminated ... and a simply swipe of a razor blade ( which is safely contained ) will trim the edge leaving your machine ready for the next job ... nice theory Scotch . 1st thing , what percentage of the population is right handed versus left handed ? ? I 'm not really sure and do n't really care but can say that being right handed I would have preferred that handle to be on the right side since the rotation of that is the most important part of the process . Getting the rotation timed just right with your other hand pushing the paper through is VERY important ... and in my hour of trying this thing , darn near impossible ! Your papers will 95 % of the time come out with bubbles and 99.9 % of the time have creases , sometimes severe creases . You can sometimes work the bubbles out by taking a soft towel or something similar and rubbing like your life depends upon it ... or sticking a needle in the middle of the hole and also rubbing til you sweat to smooth it out . The creases ... yeah , they are n't going anywhere so learn to like them if you get this machine . If you are lucky ( and it surely is luck cuz this thing is not predictable ) and happen to get a paper to come out looking rather good ... take a picture because it is probably the last . As with all laminators , you need to trim the edges , but do n't trim too close ( needs 1/2 '' to remain adhered together ) or the ends will unstick and then your paper looks even worse than when it first came out of the machine ( who woulda thunk that could be possible ? ) . EVERYTHING that comes out of it needs to be pressed/rubbed to get it all stuck together because the built-in roller that is supposed to do that is a joke.I will give Scotch one thing ... the roller is super easy to change and comes in a glossy or matte finish . I have n't had the luxury to try the matte finish ... but with the hair that I have pulled outta my head in the past hour , do n't think I 'm gon na be giving it a try . For smaller objects ( like ID cards ) , good ol ' tape across each side and then trimmed works a heck of a lot better than this ... is cheaper and takes less time . For larger sheets of paper , buy something else or find a Kinkos because this is a total waste of money . Out of 23 things I laminated in the past hour , 4 look OK and only 1 came out some-what nice . Such a disappointment ! !	-1
the purchase price for this tape is outrageuous for what you get.i would only reccomend this for people with arthritis or small kids to make it easier for them to tape items .	-1
I wanted to like this packaging tape dispenser , but in the end I would have to say there are a lot better choices . It does what it says it will do ( dispense the small core 3M packaging tape ) , but it does n't really have the features that allow me to easily ship the kind of packages that I create for my eBay sales.Positives : * The grip is ergonomic and non-slip . * The tape end does not easily roll back on to the roll and get lost . Instead , it is `` kept '' out near the cutter ready for use.Negatives : * Per foot , the tape is about twice as expensive as the 3M packaging tape with large core that you get at Costo and other warehouse stores . * The dispenser does not allow you to add tension to the roll as you apply the tape . I do this to stretch the tape tight on the package to pull flaps together . The packages must essentially be already squared up for this tape to roll on to the seam . That 's just not real world for me . I like the cheap wide core dispenser that comes with the bulk tape packages . Of course , for even more money , I like the `` industrial dispenser with the adjustable tension and `` press down '' flap that I sometimes use at work , but that 's out of this league . I would suggest that the kind of cheap dispenser that comes with some large core tape , such as http : //www.amazon.com/Scotch-Packaging-Premium-3750RD-Inches/dp/B000FDLFX8/ref=sr_1_14 ? ie=UTF8 & s ; =office-products & qid ; =1279218570 & sr ; =8-14 is a much better deal . You can tension the tape and you can use the less expensive per foot large core refills . * Since I can not control the tension , I found this unit frustrating to use and will not refill it once the uneconomical tape cartridge is done .	-1
This uses non standard packing tape rolls , forcing you to look for and buy special sized Scotch ones . This fact makes this tape dispenser practically useless and you are much better off getting theScotch HB-903 Scotch Tartan Pistol Grip Box Sealing Tape Dispenser , Uses 2 '' -Wide Tapeinstead . The Tartan one has provided me years of usage both at home and in my business . And it uses industry standard 2 '' wide tape rolls of any length.Maybe if you are a Grandma who only tapes a package once a year around the holidays or something like that , this would work for you but that is the only type of customer who could use this product over something more utilitarian and industry standard . Even Grandma would have to work very hard to locate the special proprietary refill tape rolls for this tape dispenser rather than just buy any standard tape roll ! Would you want to put her through that ? Not me.In summary , I would absolutely not recommend this product to anyone .	-1
First the good things:1 . The handle is very comfortable.2 . The wrist action to cut the tape is intuitive , and easy.3 . The design effectively prevents you from loosing the end of the tape.Those things put this dispenser way ahead of the inexpensive offerings available from other companies . And leads us to the problems.1 . It 's a very expensive way to solve the issues that less expensive offerings from other companies have.2 . It uses a proprietary sized roll of tape , so you ca n't refill it with value-priced tape refills.3 . It 's made of cheap plastic . Drop it more than once or twice , and it 's done for.4 . I do n't recommend 1.88 '' wide tape for box sealing , especially for such thin tape . ( They do n't state how many mils thick it is , but it feels to be less than 1.5 mil . ) Sealing a box effectively requires one strip over the seam , and another strip over both edges of the tape . Even then it 's still thin enough to pierce with a fingernail , and narrow enough for the seam to seperate.This might be a good option for someone who has trouble using a normal packaging tape gun , does n't have to tape things very often , and takes their packages to a pack and ship store that can retape them with wider , thicker tape . It may also be good for sealing boxes that will be only handled by hand , and not in an automated conveyor belt system . ( Example : You 're moving , and carrying all the boxes by hand . ) But for anyone who 's planning on doing a lot of taping of boxes for shipping , this is not a good choice .	-1
I got tired of writing my notes on the back of school books whenever I do n't have a table around ( Bed , Couch , Chair w/o Table ) . Unless you are barely applying any pressure to the clipboard , it caves inward . This cause your paper to wrinkle . So , if you 're writing with a pen or something , the tip of the pen could hit a wrinkle on the sheet when you rest your arm on the clipboard . Really disappointed . Good thing it was cheap . I did n't want to use a regular clipboard at first because those are pretty thin and a little too light . I might have to get one of those anyway if nothing better is available .	-1
They are really lightweight , and one does n't sharpen very good . I paid $ 1.69 for this item , and $ 6.95 shipping , for a total of $ 8.64 . I should have checked out how much shipping would be . I would say , `` the joke 's on me '' ! ! ! ! !	-1
Is nasty .i do n't why it charge too much .I think is only worth $ 0.25 .That 's it . do n't waster your money	-1
Do n't waste your money . Wrote only 5 To and From 's on Christmas labels , stopped working , then leaked all over my hands , dining room table and wood floors . Ruined two home made Christmas cards . Go to the local dollar store and buy a pack of gold and silver ink pens for $ 1.00 . MUCH better ; they wrote more fluently , more ink in the writing and not one leak or mess .	-1
I own 4 staplers which are in use throughout the house . They are all made by Swingline . This one sports a smaller size than most and average build quality . It is easy to use and works as well with 1 page or 20 pages . A nice boost in leverage provided by this design and honestly it truly IS easier to use ... ... ... .That & # 8217 ; s until it JAMS ... ... .. Yep , for some reason this unit seems prone to jamming . It works great and all the sudden , & # 8220 ; WHAMMO & # 8221 ; and you are dead in the water . I am thinking perhaps the quality of the staples I am using are not up to snuff . On the other hand , staplers should work , no matter the brand of staples , as long as they are the right size . That 's another point , you MUST get 1/4 inch S.F.4 # 35450 staples for this thing to work properly at least according to the instructions printed on the box.After bit of work and a few poked fingers I got the thing un-jammed and THEN I had trouble closing it up . Too much trouble for me to keep messing with . On the other hand , all 3 of my other Swingline Staplers work perfectly . Go figure . Sounds like some folks here have had better luck than I have , . With that in mind , your mileage may vary but I ca n't personally recommend this one .	-1
... and unnecessarily complicated.Although I 'm not a rocket scientist or a brain surgeon , I do consider myself intelligent , and as someone who rides the ADD/OCD train regularly , I tend to pay attention to details a bit more than the average Joe . If you 're more the `` this looks like I just put the paper in and slide '' type ( or even the `` I 'll read the directions and follow them to the letter type ) , you should probably skip this paper cutter.In short , I read the directions and tried to cut a piece of cover-sheet weight paper ; after 10 minutes with no cutting action going on , I was about to throw this thing against a wall . I forced myself to keep trying , however , and thanks to my curiosity , tenacity and trial-and-error , I finally managed to make a few cuts ! Either I got a bum machine or they need to add a step to the setup/instructions ; although they mention a strip of cutting surface that should be flipped every now and then , they fail to mention that said piece is covered in plastic , or that this plastic must be removed in order to cut properly - or even cut at all . I spent 10 minutes just trying to get the paper through , which did n't happen because it was catching on the plastic - something I eventually found out by trying to pry apart the cover arm- and something not explained on the instructions.Even after figuring this out I would n't recommend this cutter ; the extra step of locking and unlocking the `` hold down arm '' are unnecessary and take just enough time to be obnoxious- especially since they do n't always actually hold the paper in place . I also found that small adjustments to the pressure on the rotary blade piece resulted in an edge that was n't perfectly straight.If you 've got small kids at home and tend to keep your cutter out in the open , well , you may want to rethink that , but this might be just what you need . If , however , you do n't , I 'd definitely go with a classic `` arm '' model , or perhaps a different/better rotary model instead.UPDATE : Apparently I was n't the only one with `` challenges '' re . the lack of direction re . the `` cutting mat '' and its placement ... someone seems to have added an image of the problematic piece - complete with a note on the fact that it may have shifted in transport - to the product photos .	-1
The inside cover of this organizer has a grid on which you can track your tasks . That is somewhat helpful . The rest of the organizer are pockets with an area to write in and stuff your documents . Not really sure how this helps since I ca n't see myself carrying around a lot of project related documents ; I am more likely to file them hard copy or electronically . The organizer is really just a glorified notebook of sorts .	-1
This thing is awful ! It is bulky and way too busy with all of the bold lines everywhere . It 's already in the trash !	-1
For this pricepoint , one could expect sturdy plastic covers and even the inserts - but the paper material ( thicker than craft paper ) looks and feels so flimsy , one would be nervous about using it as a primary organizer . Highly likely to get crumbled in a laptop bag or a backpack . The tabbed design and the inserts are good ideas - but this is a good-idea product in between two flimsy cover sheets ...	-1
Although this looks like the one i saw in Staples , it is n't . I wanted one that does n't have the spring . My kids in class are tough on staplers . They spring the springs by pulling them open . This one is okay . It will work . It just is n't what i was hoping for .	-1
It does n't say it is anything like the Power Ease ; I assumed it would be something like it ; if it were not a hassle ; would send this wimpy stapler back . Do n't get it and get the Power Ease .	-1
I was really looking forward to getting this scanner since the paperwork pile I amass each month running my business seems to be growing exponentially . I 've been using an Epson GT-S50 for scanning and , while it is wonderful for processing large amounts of paper , it does not offer a database to catalog the scans . Also , it can be fussy with regard to receipt-size paper ( sometimes need to use a carrier sheet to hold the original ) . Both of those problems are issues the Neatdesk is supposed to address.Installation on a Win 7 ( 32 bit ) machine proceeded slowly , but without any drama . The only concern I had was that at various times the install seems as if it had stalled . I just gave it time and it eventually sorted itself out.The first problem came up while trying to scan odd-sized receipts . The scanner jammed repeatedly , or pulled the paper askew , which ruined the scan . It is very fussy with regard to the condition of the original . Paper that would go through my Epson without a hitch caused the Neatdesk to choke . This is a serious drawback since receipts and invoices are rarely in pristine condition -- they get crumpled and folded . But , even with a perfect original , the feeder on the Neatdesk often malfunctioned . Major source of frustration.The second source of frustration was with the software . It 's supposed to automatically know the difference between a receipt and a document , and automatically pull in key attributes from the receipt into its database . Works great in theory . In actual practice , not so much . Mis-reads are more common than good reads . You end up spending more time than if you just did things manually.The only plus is that it is more compact that other scanners , and looks nice.While the concept is good , the execution is poor . For this price I expected a lot more functionality . I 'm sticking with my Epson , and ca n't recommend this unless you will be scanning originals in perfect condition and are willing to spend time cataloging items scanned .	-1
These are great ideas , and quite pricey . Too bad they do n't work as I would like . I have always saved receipts in a file cabinet , each month has its own folder and I just move them each month . After a year passes I save the bank statements and a receipt or two that needs saving in a box , reusing the folder for new . I tried this but found it so complex , time consuming , and trouble prone , that I went back to my old and yes , better way . I also started questioning the legality of a reproduced receipt . The thin grocery store receipts are really a no go , they are thin - they jam , they cut off the scan before it completes , you get the idea ? It works great on cards , it is a great card scanner ; an expensive card scanner . I found it a very flawed idea . It looks like a wonderful idea , but takes longer than it should and the jams make it unnecessary . I am sorry to report this , I had high hopes . It is quite useless . Others have reported the paper skids with only one paper drive wheel and I confirm that to be the case . Save your money and use my old file system . Much quicker than this .	-1
Man I wanted to like this product so bad it hurt ! The ease of going paperless seemed to good to be true and in the end it was . First and foremost the 50 page maximum scan at one time is a joke . That 's only IF it counts all the papers correctly , or does n't jam , or does n't miscount . The clarity on this thing was awful for black and white documents . Even after I fooled with the settings . I would say let me try my hand at another similar machine but I think I 'm done .	-1
I didn & # 8217 ; t think I could find a product that would fail in every single way that it could , but this one actually did it . All of its features were either defective or poor in quality . It & # 8217 ; s actually funny in a twisted sort of way .	-1
DO NOT BUY ... ... .I BROUGHT THIS ONE AND THE SMALL ONE , THEY DO NOT TELL YOU THAT YOU CA N'T RE-INSTALL THIS , IF YOU LOSE YOUR MACHINE OR IF YOU HAVE TO RESTORE THE MACHINE . I WAS SO MAD , IT IS NICE , BUT IF YOU EVER HAVE TO INSTALL YOUR SOFTWARE AGAIN YOU CA N'T . I EVEN CALLED THEM ON THIS , WHEN I DISCOVERED I COULD NO LONGER INSTALL THE PROGRAM , SO BEWARE . CALL AND ASK . ITS SAD YOU BROUGHT A MACHINE OR EQUIPMENT AND ONE TIME INSTALL IS NOT ENOUGH OR EVEN TWICE . WHAT A RIP OFF , PLUS YOU CAN ONLY INSTALL THIS ON ONE MACHINE AND NOT TWO . SO THERE YOU GO . BEFORE YOU BUY ALL THESE SCANNERS , CHECK IF YOU WANT REINSTALL AND IF ITS UNLIMITED RE-INSTALL .	-1
I also own a Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i . Simply put , the NeatDesk scanner is n't even in the same class as a business tool . The Fujitsu outclasses it in every regard : speed of scan , scan quality , usability , and even price . Making things worse is the clunky NeatDesk software which adds little value . You ca n't even use this thing without their junky software . After a month of screwing around with the NeatDesk its collecting dust in my office . I 'd skip this one and get a Fujitsu instead .	-1
I spent an entire morning trying to use this scanner on 3 computers , and ended up 1 for 3 . My first choice was my older Mac ; turns out the Neat driver software wo n't install on it ( does n't say why , just an error message that it wo n't install ) and Image Capture and VueScan wo n't recognize the scanner , either.Next I tried my laptop with Windows 7 . The wifi does n't work , but that should n't be a problem when installing a scanner driver , should it ? Well , partway through the installation , I get a message that it wo n't go any further without an Internet connection . What the ? And there 's no option to cancel or abort the installation - I had to reboot to get out of it . Ugh ! Next up was my laptop with Windows XP , and this time it installed , although it stopped at one point and said it needed IE7 or higher in order to install ( ? ) But at least it 's running , after I registered at the site with the product key.This might be a decent scanner if only the software was n't so slow , clunky and 1999-ish . I scanned several business cards , and while there were errors on each one that needed editing , it did accurately capture the phone numbers on all , and names on all but one which had the name as a company-like headline . With recipes on letter-sized paper , it just takes a picture and you have to categorize and write in notes yourself . Receipts are the best thing for NeatDesk , it seems ; it easily picks out store name , date , total amount , sales tax and payment type , and lets you categorize it and generate a report.I 'm not really up on document scanners , but looking around Amazon , it appears that there are much better choices available . Or why not get a printer/scanner/fax all-in-one , that just plugs in and works , and can be networked ? This looks sleek and pretty next to the iMac ( which I ca n't even use it with ) but functionality leaves a lot to be desired .	-1
What a joke . Hardly detects anything correctly . And what it does detect , it places in the wrong column . Basically , this is a scanner where you then need to enter 95 % of everything manually . Business cards , receipts , invoices , all messed up and require manual fields entry to correct NEATDESK mistakes or out right failures to recognize.Played with scan settings , did the software update , and still just extremely poor results.Tried various types of business cards as well as documents and invoices . Nada . Just plain junk.Naturally , this is going back . I bought mine from one of those shopping channels . Not Amazon.Maybe $ 69 would be a fare asking price , but not anything over that . This is basically just a scanner . And a poor one at that.OCR from the blind.Anyone giving this more than 1 star is no doubt satisfied with entering ALL the data manually after EACH AND EVERY scan.195 1-star reviews ca n't be wrong.Junk is junk at any price .	-1
The desktop versions of Neatworks worked pretty well for me but I made the mistake of hitting the software update button before I realized that by doing so , I lost the ability to access all of the data that I had scanned into Neat . In my case it was only my business cards , but it would have been a TOTAL DISASTER if I had put critical documents into the Neat system . I complained to Neat and was given a download for the desktop version to reinstall . HOWEVER , NONE OF MY BACKUP FILES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH IT ! ! ! ! ! DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT TO ARCHIVE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS.ANOTHER CAUTIONARY NOTE : Many companies come here to review what is being said about their product and often leave comments in reply to reviews offering some kind of explanation or remedy for the problem . Go through the many negative comments about Neat products and you will see that Neat has made no effort whatsoever to interact with their customers .	-1
My bad . I did not read the fine print : requires OS 10.6 or greater . It wo n't work on my trusty workhorse , the MacBook , version 1.I will update this review when I buy a new laptop , but based on many , many reviews , it sounds like this is not all it 's cracked up to be .	-1
update -- Customer service is prompt polite and helpful , they had me delete 2 neat folders in the twain area of the windows system and it works fine now . This only happens occasionally with some computers.I did a couple receipts and busiess cards , the receipts are recognized properly but some of the business cards were treated as receipts so I had to redo them and not have it auto select , I selected business cards myself then it worked fine . It took me a while to figure out that the recipts have to be face down ... LOL I could n't find a picture that showed how to place the paper.It is working fine now and I would recomend this especially since customer service is so responsive . I would give it 4 stars now , wish I could change it.I installed it as per the directions and I keep getting a twain error that all the components can not load , please reinstall the software , I reinstalled and got the same thing ? I have winxp sp2 . I will try support later , right now it is the weekend and I really do n't want to mess with this for hours .	-1
The device itself is nice and small and very cool looking . But the quality of the scans is a very low 200 dpi . Which means it is great if you trying to scan receipts and b & w ; documents . But the quality of , let 's say , a photo ad would be bad . This really limits what you can do with this scanner.I own a Fujitsu ScanSnap S510 that is just plain awesome . I was n't expecting that from the NeatScan for $ 150 , but I was expecting high resolution scans - maybe just a lot slower . There are much better alternatives out there for a little more money . Check out the Fujitsu Scansnap S300 .	-1
I use the scanner , but with other software , because the software that came with it was too cumbersome.I had to purchase something new each time I upgraded my computer , when all I needed was a new driver.I did some research and discovered there are other scanners on the market with better customer support and more streamlined software . I purchased one of the other scanners and have been satisfied ever since .	-1
I was eager to try this because I love technology , especially products that are for practical , productive purposes.We 're an average middle-age household . Middle income , middle America , no kids . I did n't find this product helpful . It just took up more of my time . The scanning and sorting makes for interesting play , but this is overkill . We already have an efficient , manual system for handling receipts . We keep them till the credit card bill arrives , reconcile , then shred the ones we do n't need to keep . We have files for medical and big ticket items . The whole `` pay the bills , balance the checkbook , purge and file '' bit takes us about an hour and a half total per month . It takes longer just to scan receipts , and it really does n't help us keep track of where our money went . We have that information in the checkbook and our bill files , which get purged every year.This thing could help someone in an average household get organized , but you still need discipline to do that . Do n't buy this unless you 've made a real commitment to be organized . If you 've made that commitment , consider setting up your own database or spreadsheet to track your expenses . Paperless , and you probably already have the software . I 'm just saying , because this is touted as helping you declutter . But if you do n't really need it , this scanner is just clutter .	-1
I realize the fact that I ca n't get it to send the receipt info to Quickbooks is my fault . However , NOWHERE could I find any help for this issue . I went to NeatReceipts website and found out that I 'd have to pay money for a helpline policy.So , does it scan -- yes , it does great . You can organize your receipts using their software . However , the only reason I wanted this was to save me time and have the items go directly into my bookkeeping program.I will continue trying to figure out the software issue . Of course any help that anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated -- as long as I do n't have to sign a contract and pay for it .	-1
The scanner is fine . I used it with the desktop software to keep my business cards organized and it worked well . But Neat kept bugging me to `` update '' the software so I did . HUGE mistake , one that I regret . You have to go online to use it now and use their `` cloud '' services . I am not interested in their `` cloud '' services . The software is so bad they have videos for you to learn how to use it . VIDEOS to learn how to use something as simple as keeping a database of business cards . I would STAY away from this . I guess I am going back to the old physical notebook to keep my business card contacts .	-1
These were great ... until the dried up . Honestly , I expected them to last a lot longer than they actually did . That fine point , although great for taking notes and drawing detailed diagrams , is quickly rendered unusable once the ink runs low.Wo n't be buying again .	-1
Ink is over priced for to little page coverage . I have 3 brother printers and their ink cost is about one third that of this junk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Read my other reviews this is one of the few negative reviews I have ever written .	-1
I chose this product for my Canon ip3600 . The correct ink cartridges for this printer.Problem is I purchased my Canon printer in Germany and for some reason the ink cartridges are not recognized from printer.now I am stuck with these cartridges which I ca n't use and a perfectly good printer for which I have no compatible ink cartridges.I have used Canon products for a number of years and never had a problem until this one..	-1
Amazon 's little personalized box says these will fit my MP610 printer . Not so . The MP610 takes CLI-8 color cartridges . The pictured CLI-221 cartridges are for use with the 610 's successor , the MP560 ( Canon 's retrograde numbering system for its printers confuses matters even more ) . Be sure not to pay postage for the return .	-1
I 'm sure there is nothing wrong with this ink , but it does not work with the Canon MP610 printer . Amazon 's webpage indicates it is compatible and there is even a picture of the MP610 on the enclosed brochure , so Canon is under the same misconception.As always , Amazon 's return procedures make it easy to send items back for a full refund .	-1
do n't like it.it is expensive , does'nt last long enough considering the price.Amazon has the best price I could find and it was still expensive.almost cheaper to toss present printer and buy new verse the price of ink .	-1
I have had this printer for 2 years and I think it is very unpredictable . When it works , it works great , and gives me prints with nice colors , moderate speed . We have macs all over the house and print remotely so I can not comment on noise . It always acts up when you really ca n't afford it . In this day and age , you want a `` smart '' gadget . One that tells you clearly what the problem is , anticipates it before it happens , and explains what the deal is quickly . This printer does not communicate . `` Connection error '' , ink out , paper jam , paused for some random reason ... You will only know when you have waited and waited , or logged out of your computer , walked up to the printer to find that only half of the document was printed , or that it was not printed at all . It just bugs me . Plus some of the inks in it , are not widely available , and you can only get them online . They run out at various times , and you just can not count on it , even if you stock your storage . Gosh , I hate this printer .	-1
The main reason why I picked this printer was for its wireless printing capability . It has proven to be a nightmare to install this printer-I have an iMac-.I think you need an engineering degree to install this printer . I spent over one hour setting this up , and at the end , I was unable to register this printer linked to my Mac.I will try again tomorrow . It is frustrating and one reason why people usually buy a simpler printer . I will update this review ASAP	-1
The 210XL gives you 66 % more ink ( 15ml vs 9ml ) . It also does n't cost much more . The only reason the regular 210 cartridge exists is so they can give you less than a full tank of ink when you buy the printer . Do n't fall for it , buy the bigger 210XL .	-1
Works as ink is supposed to , but it 's very expensive . Will never buy a Canon inkjet again . Will stick to laser printers .	-1
Just received this printer today , and the photo printing does n't work . Called Epson and had to go through the process of testing out the printer for problems . After the test , they suggested that I return the printer . Their process for return takes 5-10 business days . Amazon got me the printer in 2 days , and is now sending me a replacement that will be here in 2 days ! Amazon is great ; Epson consumer printers I 'm no longer sure about . I 've had five of their printers go out on me , each within three years . And I 'm not talking heavy use of their printers , but I do rely on their printers for my business . So my advice is to keep your packaging when it arrives . There has been more than one complaint about this and other Epson printers . Test out everything when you get the printer . Do n't wait.Also , the above description gives the impression that Automatic Duplexer comes with the printer . It does n't . It 's a $ 29.99 accessory that you must purchase from the Epson store.The print quality of Epson printers are great , but the hardware just does n't seem stable , at least over the long haul . Be sure to register the warranty and get it extended for 2 yrs because that 's just about long their printers seem to last.Update : Turns out that I needed to insert the photo glossy paper face down ( glossy side down ) in order for it print correctly . The Epson support team did not tell me that when I called the first time . I missed reading that part in the manual.So over-all , the printer seems to be working okay . Now we will see how long it will last.June 16 , 2009 Update : Well , while the printer has been working fairly well , I want to add some additional cons to this review:1 . The autoduplixer is extremely noisy when printing . If you 're printing a long document , you might want to just leave the run and come back . It 's very annoying.2 . The settings for the autoduplixer do n't always work . If you 're for example trying to print a back-to-back document , you sometimes have to first set it to standard printing , and then go back and make changes for two-sided printing . If you simply use a preset that you created for two-sided printing , it wo n't always work.3 . Forget about using paper with the 3-rings holes already punched in . The Artisan 700 ca n't handle that paper . It gets jammed.4 . Creating setting for simply copies on the flatbed instead of from the computer seriously demands your patience . You have to click through a series of buttons to make it happen.Overall , I just ca n't say enough about how difficult that all-in-one printer is . It 's smaller in size that previous all-in-one Epson models , but it 's bigger in problems.I 'm not sure if there are better printers out there on the market , but I would strongly advise if anyone look into other options .	-1
I can not imagine Epson getting any repeat customers after this atrocity of a printer ! The problems : ( 1 ) If one ink cartridge needs replacing , the whole printer shuts down - you can not use the scanner ; ( 2 ) I 'd estimate a cartridge 's life to be about 50 prints ; and ( 3 ) The biggest `` surprise '' of all , after a littler over 500 total prints , the internal counters are set to give you an `` Inkpad '' error message , recommending you to purchase a new printer since the pads are expensive to replace . Your purchase dollars do not go far with this printer . Avoid !	-1
This riser is okay , if you only paid about half of the current price . It does n't feel that sturdy to me . I do n't have great confidence that it wo n't topple or sag . It also raises the monitor up a little too high for me . I can raise my chair up high enough that the monitor is just above eye level -- it actually should be just below for ergonomic purposes . I thought it would be nice to have a little extra desk space -- being able to store a few items under the riser . Unfortunately , the negatives outweigh that small benefit . I have already removed the riser.That said , if your current desk setup is such that you really need to raise your monitor significantly , and if your monitor is pretty lightweight , this would work for you . But I do think it 's overpriced .	-1
So here is the deal ... I recently decided to start an experiment using one of those big balls to sit on rather than slouching in an office chair all day . It 's supposed to be a good way to exercise one 's `` core '' muscles but more on that another time . In any case , I then needed a monitor riser and was just about to pick one out when this became available.Terrific timing I thought plus the idea of a nice corner unit was appealing . It arrived quickly and I eagerly unpacked it only to encounter a big , mostly plastic , highly unappealing riser . Of course , it 's the function that matters most not the looks but this feels `` flimsy '' . Not the type of flimsy that will leave your monitor sagging but the type that does n't move smoothly when adjusting.Perhaps more annoying is the actual space - this thing takes up more area than expected yet still barely manages to provide a firm foundation for the base of the monitor . Forget storing anything other than piddly stuff ( and who wants to chase that around ? ) - it wo n't fit files or other useful items.Now , having voiced my list of complaints , this does actually raise the monitor so if you are searching for a no-frills riser it will work . For that reason alone I gave it partial points but frankly , I 'd skip this one and go with a better designed one .	-1
Maybe I should give myself some more time to get used to it , but at first glance ( no pun intended ) the Fellowes Smart Suites Corner Monitor Riser looks like it 's destined for a place in our basement storage area -- not on my computer desk . Why ? * First of all , how many people actually locate their monitors in a corner ? Okay , red faced , I will admit that my future home office will use a corner location for the monitor . However , my current home office has the monitor located squarely in the middle of the wall . The monitor riser does work there , but I fear that a good push to the rear will send the rear leg over the edge . The result will be the riser and my Dell 21 '' monitor flying against the wall . * Second of all , how high is too high ? I have a custom made computer desk specially designed to have the top of the desk at the proper ergonomic height for the monitor . Now here comes the Followes and raises it higher than needed . I want to glance down at the monitor , but there is sits with my eyes squarely directed to the bottom of the screen . And that 's without the additional height with using those rubber risers . Now , maybe that 's me and maybe your desk is lower . If so , you can consider this product provided , of course , that you plan to work in a corner . But please do measure things first . * Third of all , what 's up with those instructions and those unknown extra parts ? Granted , documentation is n't always what it should be . But the double-sided instructions are confusing and hard to follow -- and I am an engineer . ( I know . Shame on me ! ) I managed to figure things out with one notable exception just by looking at the riser and it 's associated parts . Honestly , it 's not that hard.Oh yes , the one exception . For the life of me I ca n't figure out what the extra parts ( screws ? ) are intended to be . They do n't show on the instructions ( I do n't think that they do ) , so what is their intent . And what about that part on the instructions that looks like a USB bridge . Where is it in the box and what does it do ? Really , Fellowes . Monitor risers are n't intended to be so hard or so complex that they need two pages of instructions to install . Someone clearly was rushing or not paying close attention when this product was put together . Not very smart.Now , if you 'll pardon me . I have to remove my Dell monitor from the Fellowes Smart Suites Corner Monitor Riser and carry the riser downstairs to store for possible use at some future date .	-1
The stand works as it should , in that it raises my monitor just under 4 inches . However , for $ 30 ( $ 40 as their MSRP ) , I am hard-pressed to give this a rating of anything higher than 2 stars.The stand comes with two sets of rubber raisers , which raise the stand half-an-inch each . It 's made of plastic , and even though it seems sturdy enough , I doubt this will last in the long run . It slightly bent before going back into shape when I put my 17 '' Dell monitor atop . I use it at the office , so it actually adds more desk space . The box it comes in makes it seem as though there 's more to it . Now that I peruse Amazon.com 's listing , a couple of the photos show an attachment that holds a laptop . IT IS NOT INCLUDED . You only get the stand and two sets of rubber raisers . That 's it.For $ 30 , I 'd suggest you look elsewhere . This is a universal stand that took me a while getting used to because of its un-adjustable height ( besides the two raisers ) , but I 'd strongly recommend you get something that accommodates your specific monitor . It would be around the same price , if not cheaper , and most likely made of better material . If this were $ 10 , maybe even $ 15 , I would give it 4 stars as a stand that can not adjust shorter than 4 inches.Most monitors can raise themselves , but those that ca n't ( mine ) , it 's probably too low for the office environment , and can lead to bad posture . That 's the only reason I ordered a monitor riser , but I 'm considering another option .	-1
Didnt get the XL just the reg one to save some cash , and in the end printed about 4 8x10 's and it was empty , so I end up spending way more to get another XL which I should have in the 1st place . DO NOT think you are going to be ok getting the smaller 1 for a few bucks less , it is not worth it !	-1
You can get 13ml of ink in the XL , 44 % more than the 9ml in the regular 211 . And it is n't much more expensive . So do n't buy this one , buy the 211XL .	-1
I have to use one of these at work . I despise having to use it . Sometimes I 'll print things at home just to avoid using it . My boss ' wife used this printer before me , and she kept insisting that it was broken to her husband/my boss . He sent it in to be repaired , and they sent us a new one , no questions asked . That 's suspicious . Well my boss ' wife insisted that the new one was broken as well . He purchased a Canon for her and gave me this one to see if I could get it to work for me . I ca n't . It takes anywhere between 3-10 minutes to make it print something . I will press the print button on my computer and it will make a sound like `` eeee . eeee . eeee . eeee . thhhhlrup . eeee . eeee . eeee . thhhlrup ceuuuuuuuu . eeee . eeee . eeee . eeee . '' Once while I was printing something my boss asked if I was okay because he heard the noise and thought I was choking on something . After about 3 or 4 rounds of the sounds and some sputtering , it will finally print . For some reason , the first page always takes the longest . After it starts printing , it does n't have to go through its routine again unless you let it go without printing for ten minutes.Another awful thing : the paper tray . I dread it when I actually have to load this thing . If I do n't line the paper up exactly right , it will jam constantly later on . The back wall of the tray is slanted , making it very hard to line the paper up right and keep it in a tight stack . If I let the paper stack at a slant , the printer will angrily beep at me to correct it.I JUST replaced the ink , and not a day later , after printing three pages , I get a low ink warning . I pulled out the cartridges and looked . There is plenty of ink.Every week I get a message telling me to clean the head . So I do , even though its just as spotless as I left it the week before because I have n't actually printed anything.The tray that catches printed papers is flimsy , at best.Ergonomically , I like the printer . The screen is easy to use , and adjusting the screen is very easy . The plastic seams are smooth everywhere except the tray that holds printed papers . There are no problems opening the printer up . The operating system on the printer is straightforward and simple . The scanner works dandy . This printer was very well thought out and designed , and it 's a shame that the mechanical components were not up to par . The only thing this printer is n't good at is printing.Update : 7/2/12Printer gave out on me , permanently . It kept jamming , beeping at me to clean the print head , replace the ink , remove paper from the top tray and two other things I ca n't even remember . Then it beeped at me to turn it off . I did . I guess I put it out of its misery because I have n't been able to turn it on since . Going to try to get a refund . I feel bad that my boss actually paid money for this .	-1
I have had this printer for approximately 2 years now . Right out of the box , it had some pluses and minuses . I was pretty impressed with it initially , but now I am disenchanted.The things I liked about it when I bought it were : 1 . Wireless connection to my home network , 2 . Sleek design with LED controls , 3 . The promise of high quality prints from an all-in-one printer . One thing I did not like about it is the clunky paper tray which must be removed in order to change papers , and is a flimsy nature of the paper adjustment tab inside the tray.Two years later , I still appreciate the machine for its wireless connection to my home network . Also , I have never had any trouble with the LED controls . The machine 's paper feeder ( on top ) folds closed into a sleek profile that sheds dust when it is closed . However , it developed paper feed problems verily quickly right from the start , both from the bottom tray and the upper paper feeder . Both trays have a tendency to pick up more than one piece of paper at a time . The top tray got so bad that I had to feed it one paper at a time , I could no longer put a stack of papers in it and have it pull them out one at a time and copy them . By now , the upper paper feature does not work at all . Every single paper that I try to feed into it jams , which makes multi-page faxes a thing of the past . Essentially , it is impossible to fax anymore , which is a great disappointment to me.The `` photo quality printing '' turned out to be a problem right from the start . I purchased some high-quality paper to use with it , and it turned out that the paper was too heavy and became jammed . I talked to an expert at the company where I purchased the paper , and he told me that the Artizan 800 was not recommended by his company because it did not have an upper paper hopper to load the heavier stock into . He told me that bottom feed printers such as the one I bought were not really suitable for the heavier photographic papers.In addition , the printer driver does not work very well for non-Epson papers . Initially , I did buy some Epson papers and was dissatisfied with them because I do not like their texture . Switching to a better quality paper presented a problem because there was no way to adjust the driver to accept it . The best I could do was to get into the `` Advanced '' tab in the printer driver and adjust that for an Adobe profile , gamma 1.8 . This does not give pictures that are absolutely true to my calibrated monitor , but the approximation is okay . At this point , I am shopping for a dedicated photo printer that will accept ICC profiles for the papers I want to use . I really like the papers that I have bought from RedRiver Papers.All in all , I am disappointed with this printer , and probably will not purchase an Epson printer again . I will probably purchase an inexpensive HP all-in-one to replace the Artizan . Fortunately , I was initially able to buy the Artizan at a deep discount , so I do not feel so completely ripped off.I would not recommend buying this printer , I believe that other printers will do a comparable job , or even better job , for less money .	-1
Purchased locally in 2010 for every so often , light color projects . To make this brief : Cons : - It takes forever to get its act together at start up , and when changing ink.- The paper tray is a horror show ; the designer of this tray was probably related to Freddy Krueger ... get use to numerous paper jams , and heavy stock will make it cry.- Installation is confusing ... with separate software installs for the scanner , along with a hit and miss network setup ; re-installing drivers is not something you 'd want to look forward to.- The CD loader and paper catch are laughably flimsy.- It 's big , heavy and ugly to be quite honest.- Ink runs out fast , and most recently , I ca n't get two NEW inks to print , even after many attempts at every option on the maintenance menu ( this is what finally set me off to post here ) .Pros : - The scanner works well for attaching PDFs to email , and that 's about all this baby is doing these days . At least that does n't require printing , on this `` printer '' .Do yourself a favor , stay clear of this useless monolith . I think I 'll switch to Cannon next time , because I 've had even worst issues with anything from HP ( printer , laptop ) . Plus , HP 's tech support is horrific .	-1
I am an engineer , and any engineer working for Epson should be embarrassed to admit they work for this company . Today I am throwing out a perfectly good , like brand new Epson Artisan 800 printer simply because the `` Printer ink pads are at the end of their service life . Please contact Epson support. '' . I am not kidding . My printer has printed less than 1000 pages , and when the ink pads that take the excess ink get full , Epson has it set up so that the printer shuts down and is no longer useable . I am not making this up- it comes straight from Epson . Virtually every time you use the printer after a day of non-use , it goes through a full cycle of head cleaning that literally shoots a tablespoon of ink into the pads . Yes , I am serious , I tested it with my own eyes and have seen other 's videos of this . You can turn off the automatic head cleaning , but then you have to deal with frequent bad pages , so it is a catch 22 situation . Anyway , after talking to Epson , I was offered a `` deal '' on the Artisan 835 to replace this one ... .Yes , I am serious , Epson designed this unit to be thrown away when it is in perfect condition simply because the ink pads are full . You ask , you mean they did n't simply make it so you could remove the ink pad , clean it , and reset the printer and keep on printing ? Yes , that is what I am saying . Their engineers should have their diplomas stripped . You can buy software to reset the printer ( but not from Epson ) , and then go through the process of removing and cleaning your ink pads . What a joke ! Epson should have built the availability to do this easily themselves . If they think their planned obsolescence of the printer will make them more money , think again . I will never buy another Epson inkjet printer .	-1
After getting burned by expensive Epson printers in the past I vowed not to give Epson another chance ever , but this product seemed almost too good to be true . What others have pointed out - and what I did n't notice at first either - is that Epson will go to any length to embellish the truth about their products . Notice how it reads `` built-in double sided printing '' in the product description . Then you see three asterisks pointing to the fine print that says `` only on a Mac and only with the optional duplexer . '' Sorry Epson , last time I checked `` built-in '' was still defined as `` present , '' not something you have to shell out extra dough for . More importantly , and in contrast to the high quality pictures you get from Canon machines in the same price range , Epson 's inks are only fade-resistant - and they do n't tell you how long they 'll actually last . Stay away from Epson and get yourself something better .	-1
I had selected both this product and Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches , Letter , 5 mil , 100 Pack ( 52040 ) to see what the difference would be , which would be better overall at least for me . The 5 mil pouches are extremely durable and I did n't experience any bubbles in the 5 mil . laminated pouches A++ . Funnily , the 3 mil . pouches from the same company had bubbles after lamination . Though I do like the idea of a little more bendability for some of the laminating items , but with the bubble problem , it 's just not worth it .	-1
Teachers , you 're better off buying real pencils at 3x the cost . These are horrible . Many have un-centered lead , so they did n't work at all . It 's almost impossible to re-sharpen them , so they 're one time use . I considered them a waste of money .	-1
I tried fountain pens years ago and did n't care for them and I gave them another try with this disposable one . My opinion remains unchanged . Clumsy to use and writing looks sloppy . I 'll stick with my roller ball pens .	-1
I bought this for art journaling and found them hit or miss as far as what they will write over . Plus , they stink pretty badly when using . I like the sakura Uni-ball pens better for a white pen .	-1
I shook this pen for 3 full minutes and it still did not produce any white ink . I truly dislike being sent an out dated product . Do not buy !	-1
In my experience with this particular letter opener , I have found it to be too dull to do a good job opening even plain , white , standard-thickness envelopes . Rather than creating a neat slit across the top of the envelope , the paper buckles , shreds and usually a corner of the envelope rips off , making it difficult to remove the contents of the envelope .	-1
The yellow section really helps me organize my notes and take out the more important information . However , an 80 page notebook for $ 6 ? No . There are much , MUCH cheaper options out there . This is good quality , but come on , you could get a yellow highlighter and a few notebooks with more pages for a lot less .	-1
I am so relieved to read that other reviewers had the same reaction to this notebook that I did : the colors of the pages are gaudy . The second I opened this product , I knew I could not use it in a professional setting . The ruled area is & # 34 ; ruled & # 34 ; in a royal blue , the & # 34 ; QuickNotes & # 34 ; section is an alarming yellow , and there are pinkish-red lines in the notes section . As mentioned , it looks like a primer that one might use in high-school when taking a business course . Not to mention , on each page , the words & # 34 ; QuickNotes & # 34 ; appear at the top in a large , silly font.For me , this is unusable .	-1
With a product named & # 34 ; Business Notebook & # 34 ; , I was expecting something with professional quality and professional features . What you get is only slightly different from a typical school notebook . You get the same thin plastic cover and spiral binding . The paper is perhaps a little thicker than the cheapest school notebooks , but nothing special . The paper is oddly printed into separate white and yellow sections which are both labeled & # 34 ; Quick Notes & # 34 ; . The product photo makes it appear to have a pocket in the front , but that is an illusion . The product description says & # 34 ; perfect for use with smartphones & # 34 ; . What does that mean ? This is just a paper notebook . There is no pocket to carry a smartphone or any other smartphone features that I can see . The price of this notebook is double what a school notebook would cost and for that price I would expect some real business features like a hard cover , pockets for pens and business cards , etc . Maybe this meets other peoples ' business needs , but not mine .	-1
I initially thought this notebook would include not only the Quicknotes , but also the itemized chart pages and regular lined pages as shown in one of the item photos , unfortunately , it 's just the Quicknotes.I 've used Mead 's Quicknotes in the past and they worked well for client and office meetings , however , the this new version is not as well-designed . The covers are made of thin and floppy vinyl , so it 's impossible to use this without laying it on a writing surface , which does n't work well when you 're visiting a client and want to jot down notes without asking to use their desk.The next issue is the paper itself . This appears to have a high recycle content , and is thinner than regular 24lb copy paper . Gel pens bleed through easily , so the back of the page is useless . I 've added a photo to illustrate this , which you should be able to see in the `` Customer Images '' to the right.Finally , the bright yellow QuickNotes section is way too dark . The old one that I had was closer to buttercup yellow , making it easy to see what 's written on it even if you use a pencil . This darker yellow makes it hard to decipher pencil or thin pen marks .	-1
Love this notebook for taking notes for our monthly business meetings at work . Keeps them all in order for review from month to month without having to search for them . Highly recommend ! I give this five stars and a big thumbs up !	-1
I 've had this for a few months and it is supportive . It comes in two pieces , a gel wrist support and pad that is one piece plus a hard plastic piece that adheres to the pad portion of the support . You are to keep the hard plastic . It sounds like some people tossed theirs . The problem is that in hot weather moisture forms between these two layers , the hard plastic and the gel pad , and turns into mildew . Once it 's there , there 's nothing you can do to get rid of it and you need to buy a new pad.That being said , this is still a great mouse pad . It relieves the stress put on the wrist when typing on the computer all day . I 've tried other wrist supports but this one is easier to use and fits better next to the computer and keyboard . The other colors are rather ugly so I 'll be sticking with the blue and I like it enough to reorder the same thing . I 'm not very happy I already have to replace it though . And if they get rid of the blue and do n't have a lighter color ( like clear ) , I 'll be getting something different .	-1
This is a good quality printer but it cost a lot to operate ! We have this printer for few months and we have already replaced ink cartridge 6 times ! yes , 6 times ! We do not use the printer often - just occasional for printing homework for school or work . If one of the ink cartridges is low ( not even empty ! ) , this machine shut down and wo n't even print anything until you replace it to a new cartridge . I used to have HP printer and it operates until the ink cartridge is empty ... .So get ready to spend money for ink cartridges if you are buying this printer ...	-1
I was given a chance to review an Epson printer . I never owned or used an Epson printer so I 'm excited t see what all the hype is about.First off the printer looks cool but feels CHEAP ! I had to take another look to make sure this was an Epson . So I hooked it up and started printing . I 'm NOT impressed with this printer . Let me break down the pros and cons so we can get to the point.Pros : Print quality is decent while the cartridges last . It is quick , but then just about everything sold is pretty quick these days . Printer looks cool . The printer is pretty quite.Cons : After about 10 photo prints and some coloring pages my kids printed , the ink was done ! A new set of chipped OEM cartridges costs as much as the printer . Paper feed is as clumsy , it will not let you use aftermarket ink products and goes through ink like the ink is free . Compatible cartridges are perfect physical match , rejected electronically ! ! Summary : The big deal with this printer is the cost of OEM ink.. If you plan to print more than 3 color PPY ( pages per year ) with this printer , save your money . If you plan to print fewer than 3 PPY with this printer , save your money anyway : One or two print head cleanings will deplete a $ 75.00 OEM cartridge set ! Yikes ! Stay far , far away from this awful product . I was really disappointed with Epson . I 'm staying with my HPs and Canon printers .	-1
I have several Epson printers and this one is the worse . When this printer works it is great ! However , the key word here is WHEN ! The print heads always clog ! If you do not use this printer everyday , you can forget about it . It is a long process to get everything cleaned out ... which means you are using a ton of ink with no guarantees it is going to work . As of right now , I have spent over 2 hours trying to get the cyan to work . I have done everything in my power ... I really am starting to hate this printer !	-1
Oh dear - I guess I got a Friday job . This inexpensive 29 inch bar stool would normally have suited my needs perfectly but unfortunately the construction of this one was WAY off . I 'm talking about the pre-installed small rectangular wooden box under the seat that you attach the four legs to . The four wooden rails were so far off center that the legs on one side are actually partially outside the saddle . It 's offset by about five inches resulting a weird unstable 'diving board ' look to the stool with all of the overhang to one side.I ca n't understand how the makers could n't have seen what a shoddy job they did before packing it into a box for sale . Of course I fixed it by removing the legs , the rails and re-installing them where they 're supposed to go but I had to measure and pre-drill holes which is time and effort I should n't have to do . Plus it spoiled some of the already poor paint job.Overall not a great experience .	-1
I was amazed at how quickly the ink kept running out . The standard capacity model is horrific . You have to get the high capacity just to make it last more than a couple of months with minimal use.I was n't printing much at all and it was as if the ink just evaporated . I would pull out the cartridge , shake it , but no change . After spending way too much on ink I finally got rid of the printer and switched to laser and a different brand . No more Epson for me .	-1

( Please note that this is a review for the version of this product that comes with only 2 handsets - but all the components are the same otherwise ) .The first problem I had was that one of the handsets occasionally somehow lost its connection to the base station despite it sitting in same . Re-connecting it a couple of times solved that problem.Another problem that I saw right away - but it 's really just cosmetic - is that in the satellite base station , the paint is so thin that the whole bottom of the thing glows red when the charging LED is on ( which is whenever the phone is sitting in it ) .Anyway , neither of these were a big deal and if that 's all I experienced , I probably would have given these 4 stars.But after using the phones for a month or so , two really annoying problems have started : First , the handset in the base station often says the battery is low when I pick it up , even though it 's always sitting in the base station with the charging light on ( and of course when it 's actually *in* the base station , there is no `` battery low '' message ) .Second , sometimes when I answer the phone using the handset , the ringing continues and the handset shows `` CONNECTING '' for sometimes 3-4 more rings before it really does connect . This is REALLY annoying . ( There 's also no auto-answer , where you can just pick up the handset to answer - instead you have to press the green button ) .On the upside ? Well , the voice quality is really clear , and the menu system on the phone is fairly easy to use ( for instance you do n't need the instructions to figure out how to change the time/date ) . But that does n't make up for the other problems .	-1
Canon support told me when I purchased this printer about 9 months ago that a linux driver was being developed . All I want is to print from either Windows or linux ; I do n't need to scan or fax . However , there is still no linux driver . If you 're running a linux OS , choose a different printer .	-1
There is nothing premium about these `` Canon 104 Compatible '' cartridges . When you consider the wasted paper from having to reprint documents to see if you can find a document without lines or spots on many of the pages . If you do n't care about having to reprint then go ahead and purchase this product . But if you need a reliable cartridge , one that will create pages without spots or lines where there is not supposed to be ones , then purchase an authentic CANON CARTRIDGE .	-1
I received a credit from the seller for the first of the two cartridges that I purchased because it left big black smudges down the side of the paper . I had the same problem with the second cartridge from this order , but did n't bother to go through the hassle of a refund . I just lived with the flawed printouts . Since this model is a drum and toner all in one , I know the problem is in the toner , not in the printer and the source of the smudges would be within the cartridge .	-1
This `` compatible '' toner cartridge is not the same as the original one from Canon . It prints just great on regular paper . I print post cards for my business . I found that the toner wo n't stick to the post cards at all . The toner is smeared all over the place . I did n't have this problem with the Canon toner cartridge . So to me , this toner cartridge is useless . That is why you see the reviews are either very good or very bad . When it works , it is great . You pay less than half of the real thing . But when it does n't work , then it is useless . I am not going to buy another printer to print the things that this toner catridge can not print.I know the cost of genuine Canon cartridge is very high per page . But this `` compatible '' one is simply not compatible . If you print more than plain printer paper , do not buy this .	-1
Worked fine for the first 100 pages or so , and then the toner stopped sticking to the paper in some places . Using Xerox copy/printer paper . Will try cheaper paper .	-1
It fits anywhere , however it is so small it would be easier to have half a sheet of paper in my pocket . I though it & # 34 ; flips & # 34 ; open which it does but you must use the pen to keep it closed . The pen is also very small and would not work for anyone with large hands .	-1
This is what you get from a company that ca n't even hire one designer or drafter to make a sensible product . It is basically junk with a poor design in all areas . They tell you to put the mounting clips on the sides of the frame obviously because they are afraid the board will fall apart if you put them on the top . The cork is about 1/16 '' thick with a thin backing of an unknown material.They did n't have enough sense to put a cheap piece of cardboard on the back to hold push pins and keep from having them punch holes is the wall behind . I fixed this by cutting a piece of cardboard from the shipping box . I used duct tape to hold the cardboard in and taped the corners of the frame on the back side . After these modifications it works pretty well.For those that did n't like the white logo on the black portion of the frame , you can easily scrape it off with your fingernail .	-1
Well , based on the reviews it seemed like an okay product . Unfortunately such is not the case . The marker did n't work . The surface of the board itself is poor and very soon erasing previous listings was nearly impossible . Pretty much a waste of money .	-1
My main purpose for this scanner was to convert old artwork , paperwork , photos , etc from my children 's childhood into workable PDFs . The scanning images are nice , neat , colorful , clear.However , the issue was that in scanning several pages into PDFs , the `` rotate image '' function did n't work . I know what I am doing , so that is not the issue . The pages would come out upside down , even though I edited the images to make sure they come out in the manner intended . Rotation of images must be correct ! Who wants to keep rotating and then have it mess up more ? Epson support was no help whatsoever , but they did confirm that I was doing the right steps.Once in a while in scanning photos , an odd color of green was used and I could not change that . With some photos , blues and greens showed up completely different from the original photo . The good thing about scanning is you can place several photos to scan at once . That sure makes it easier than changing photos all the time.My old scanner was an Epson , but since my PDFs did n't work on this new one , I may not choose an Epson again . This feature was very important.After hours of frustration , mainly because you have several modes that operate differently , some do this , some do that only , very confusing . I sent the thing back ! ! ... .Rizzo	-1
I got it based on the reviews on amazon.com . Granted , I got it a couple of years after it first appeared on the market ( light-years in today 's world , I suppose . ) Installation was easy.My problem was two-fold:1 . The scan results were lousy : Color negative scans come out uneven in color ( I switched the film around to make sure the problem was with the scanner -- it was . ) Flatbed scans have a nasty purple streak smack down the middle of the glass . Anything wider than 4 inches will get the streak and it takes forever to get rid of it.2 . Both of my PCs , Windows XP , crashed shortly after I installed the scanner . Do n't know what the source was , but I googled and Epson 's driver seems to be connected to quite a few of the crashes . I never did figure out the source of the crashes , so maybe they were co-incidences.In the end , it is downright disappointing . Too bad I did n't test it as soon as I got it ( too busy then . )	-1
First of all , this thing is HUGE . It barely fits in my son 's backpack . It is so thick . Also , it is hard to zip it all the way around when you have folders in it . The space between the zipper and folder edge is not adequate . I knew this would be a problem so I showed him how to zip it easier . Well , the first day he used it , the easy access zipper broke . Completely . It is not repairable . Due to the excessive size of this thing and its obvious lack of durability , I would not recommend it for use with kids . My son is 15 but still managed to break it the first day . I regret this purchase and I paid $ 25 for it . : (	-1
I have tried a number of fountain pens and I have n't hated any like I do this one . I converted this to an eye dropper and it leaked all over the place . But , leaving that aside , I find the nib to be scratchy . It 's unpleasant to write with . Within just days of having this pen , it does n't write at all anymore although I can see it still has ink in it . If you want a dirt cheap fountain pen , do yourself a favor and get either a Pilot Varsity or Pilot Petit . Both of those have a much much smoother nib , and a nice wet inky nature . And if you would like an entry fountain pen that 's got a bit more class , go for the Pilot Metropolitan . I do n't know how or why , but Pilot just seems to consistently make smooth nibs , even at low price points.Note- the color of this ink really is violet . It is not purple . It 's what you would expect magenta tinged with a little bit of blue to look like - violet , not purple . I like it.I 'll also add that I 've tried this pen out at several different art stores to see if maybe mine was just a dud , but everywhere I have tried it , it still had that unpleasant feel to the nib and half the testers did n't write at all- just like mine now !	-1
After using this phone system for about two years in a business environment ( full service restaurant & bar ) , I can honestly attest that the negatives greatly outweigh the positives on this phone . It is an incredibly disappointing and frustrating phone system.SOUND QUALITY : The sound quality is good , but it quickly degrades to complete stuttering static if you 're more than 20-25 feet from the base unit . Might be okay if you have a very small office , or very small home , but does not work well in realistic business applications . Even small offices should stay away from this one based on range alone . Volume is fairly good on this model , as we 're able to turn it up high enough to hear in a restaurant environment.RINGERS : A sad array of very annoying ringers , most of which are melodies that are inappropriate for business use.INTERFERENCE : A huge drawback to this phone is how pervasive interference is . Set any of the receivers anywhere near an iPhone and the receiver instantly powers off . Walk near an appliance such as a microwave and it disconnects your call.DISPLAY : Mediocre . It 's easy enough to read , but it is monochromatic and looks pixelated and rather dated . Not really an issue , but personally , I 'd like to see an updated display.FEATURES : Just a few , and they 're hard to use . The menu structure is hard to navigate and every feature is buried in a frustrating hierarchy of menus.VOICEMAIL : Sound quality is terrible on the recorded outgoing message . Very compressed voice quality with tons of digital noise . Again , not appropriate for business use.OVERALL : This is another disappointing entry in the astonishingly limited field of two-line expandable phone systems . Why , oh why ca n't anyone make a business worthy cordless expandable system ? There is a lot of call for such a system , for those big enough to need it , but not big enough to justify the expense of a wired PBX system . If you 're looking to use this phone for business , it is simply unacceptable . For a small home office , it just might fit the bill as long as you do n't need a lot of range to your phones and do not use iPhones within your home .	-1
For actual writing these markers are fine . However , the caps do not stay fixed onto the back of the marker when you remove them . As such they have a tendency to get lost . Obviously once you loose the cap its not long before the marker runs out.I do like the narrow tips that allow for more precise writing , if they could fix the caps my rating would go up.Recommendation : PassIf you found this review helpful ( or not ) please vote below to let others know.Thanks .	-1
After seeing all these glowing reviews , I 'm wondering if maybe I got a bad batch.I wanted to try these as alternatives to Expo because they 're so much cheaper . The thing is , I found Expos much easier to read than these ; that is to say , the Endura-Glide markers were writing about as well brand new as my regular Expos do when I 'm ready to throw them out after a few weeks ' use . I was not satisfied with the saturation of color , my students complained they could not see what I was writing , so I threw out the box after trying all four markers once .	-1
I did not like these markers at all because they are translucent - sheer , difficult-to-see color that makes writing difficult to see at a distance . The ink is not like normal dry erase markers whatsoever , and it is simply not true that these markers produce & # 34 ; strong , bold color. & # 34 ; The other claimed benefits - such as caps that prevent rolling , and a visible ink well - did not matter to me as I could not see clearly what I had written .	-1
I was attracted to the sleek design of the new Philips ID155 and thought I would upgrade my current phone system ( Motorola MD681 , 5.8 GHz ) . My current unit has the Motorola base station with two other wireless phone units on each floor of my home . The Philips has the same optional remote units that you can purchase separately.After trying out the Philips I found that the sleek design of the handset was too small to hold for long periods of time and my hand would cramp up . In addition the hands-free speaker-phone seemed to cut in and out when the person on the phone was talking , so I was not happy with that function.There were a few things that I did like about the phone . It was easy to figure out the programming and includes an easy to read 51-page printed booklet . I loved the variety of built in ring tones including whirls , flicks , rings , buzzers , techno , ragtime , march , cha-cha , and asian ( my favorite was the bell 2 ) . It has a pretty blue indigo display and the unit it 's self takes up very little counter space with a 5 '' x3.5 '' footprint.Overall I loved the look and some of the functions of the unit , but will stick with my current Motorola just for the speaker-phone and comfort of the handset . You can turn off the answering machine function of the Phillips quite easily , so I will use it as an extension phone in my spare room until my Motorola conks-out.If you are looking for an inexpensive phone system that takes up very little counter space , this is the unit for you !	-1
Original Review ( really liked this phone at the beginning ) : This Philips ID555 cordless answering machine phone is DECT 6.0 and comes from the Philips ' Design Collection . It features:200 entry phonebook50 entry call logA selection of ringtonesCaller ID130 hours standby time10 hours talk time30 minutes of answering machine timeSpeakerphonePer the Product Packaging : Handset is 8.5 '' W , 6.93 '' H & 3.07 '' DThe phone was designed in Europe & made in ChinaThe phone has `` very low energy consumption '' Overall , I really like this phone/answering machine . It is stylish , low profile & user friendly . Set up is easy and the set-up features ( clock , message , ringtone , etc . ) are very easy to figure out and accomplish . Call quality is good and range is very good . The phone comes with a quick start guide and a regular user manual ( separate manuals/guides in English , French & Spanish ) .My only complaint is that I could n't find an extension handset anywhere even though it looks like the phone has been out for awhile . I feel that the availability of an extension handset is critical when looking to purchase a home phone . I 've emailed Philips customer support , and found out that Philips has discontinued manufacturing landline phones & never put the extension handset for this product into manufacturing . There are no extension handsets available at all.If you can get by with one phone/answering machine , this is a nice unit . However , since it is out of production , this is a fact you should take into consideration.Overall Impression of the Phone - 5 StarsEase of Finding an Extension Handset - 1 Star4/19/10 : Information per Philips ' online support ( edited ) : Philips is no longer manufacturing landline phones , and what is on the market now is it as far as product availability ... The ID5550B [ the extension handset ] was never made -- So there are no extensions . I am sorry ! 7/28/10 : The phone has died . No dial tone . Pretty phone , crappy construction .	-1
Pros : * Easy installation and setup* Slim design and modern look* Small footprintCons : * Speakerphone is horrible for both ends . The sound cuts out frequently . * The interface is not intuitive . ( E.g . the base does not include a speakerphone so calls can not be picked up from the base . )	-1
Let me start this review by noting that I received a defective unit right out of the box . I opened the box , powered the device up and found it would shut itself off in just a second or so . I checked the batteries which appeared OK . The problem kept recurring , so I changed the batteries . When the problem persisted , I started testing and realized that my Entourage7 would not stay powered on with the battery compartment cover in place ! If I removed the cover , the unit stayed on , but each time I would replace the cover , it would shut off . I examined the compartment and cover and can not find anything causing this situation , but it does happen.So ... .I left the cover off and tried using the device . For the price , it includes a lot of features . It translates in 7 languages , of which is English . So keep in mind if you speak English , French , German , Italian , Japanese , ( Mandarin ) Chinese , or Spanish , you really have 6 `` other languages '' to which you can translate.The most important note about this product ... .while it is versatile and has a library of over 700 phrases ( each translatable to/from all 7 languages ) , it does not allow for entering of your own sentences , so bear in mind you can look up and translate phrases , but ca n't type something freehand like `` Hi can you get me to a PC . I want to log in to amazon.com '' . Nor does it allow you to speak a phrase into the device for translation . At this price point , you should not expect that sort of feature , but I just wanted to note it so no one misunderstands what the Entourage7 does.The device is compact . A downside to this is that the text for most of the buttons on the front panel is extremely small , equivalent to perhaps a 4 or 5 point font . I have 20/20 vision and do n't need reading glasses but some of the button text was difficult to make out.Also , the top 12 buttons have text over the button , another button has its text label under the button , two other buttons are labeled to the right and left of those particular buttons and the ` joystick ' button is labeled on the button.The screen size is easy to read and can be backlit , and once you can figure out what the button text says , most of the controls and menus are intuitive.The translations I did from English to Italian were accurate enough so someone speaking an Italian dialect would understand.PROs : * Lightweight and compact - about the size of a Blackberry device . * Displays the translated phrase . * Speaks the translated sentences for you . * Headphone jack so you can listen to translation in private and repeat the phrase to someone rather than reading the display or playing the recording for them . * Translates about 700 phrases in 8 categories useful to travelers . * Good battery life can be anticipated due to battery type ( PC CMOS type battery as opposed to AA or AAA cells ) .CONs : * Button label text is very small . * If my defective device is any indicator , predicted reliability may not be good.All in all a decent product for the price . I rated it just 2 stars , however , given the defective one I received . I have contacted the manufacturer about the defect and will update this review when I hear back from them .	-1
Because this little hand-held gizmo works on phrases rather than individual translation of words , its use is quite limited , IMHO . I have a smaller unit made by another manufacturer which has more languages and can translate word by word , but does n't have the spoken translation . That 's fine too , but can be hard to understand without listening to it a couple times on this unit . I also found that the display was difficult to read unless I fumbled in my purse first for my reading glasses.I think it also marks you as a tourist immediately ! Which probably negates any good it might have otherwise done if you 're dealing with making a purchase or even in a restaurant.All that being said , for a few key phrases it will work in a pinch - just hope that the native speaker with whom you are trying to converse does n't answer back verbally because you 'll never get it with this little gadget !	-1
I was excited to try out this item since it has Mandarin Chinese . I 've been teaching myself Chinese for a year and try to practice by going to the Chinatown in Flushing NY , where Mandarin is the predominant tongue ( as opposed to Cantonese in most other Chinatowns ) .The heart of this translation unit is a set of pre-programmed phrases geared toward the casual short-term visitor . There are dedicated buttons for categories such as restaurants , transportation , etc . Within each category is about a dozen or two phrases that may or may not prove helpful to you . A bonus is that it will pronounce the phrases via the built in speaker ( 3 volume levels ) or headphone jack.The main disadvantage of this unit is that you 're limited to whatever phrases the programmers decided to include . Some phrases are certainly helpful , such as asking for the bill , making reservations and asking directions . However , many phrases are completely useless from a culture-specific view . Sure , asking what type of cheeses are available is appropriate in Italy or France , but very out of place in China ( where they abhor cheese ) . They could have easily changed the cheeses to tofus and it would have been more relevant . This was a major disappointment for me because I felt like they did not do any research into what phrases might actually be useful to translate into Chinese . They basically picked a set of `` universal '' phrases and used them for all the languages . The same comments apply to the Japanese phrase pack as well - though they do tend to eat a little bit of cheese.Frankly , even when using the phrases in one of the Romance languages , they are rather boring . No , I 'd rather not ask what type of typical American dishes are served when traveling to a foreign nation . Those types of travelers can go to a McDonald 's just about anywhere in the world and do fine without a translator.The thing I liked the most about this unit was the Chinese pronunciations . I thought they were spot-on and incredibly helpful for a complex tonal language . As a beginner , I find myself hitting the `` talk '' button frequently so that I can pay close attention to the tones . It 's the next best thing to having a native speaker friend who is willing to repeatedly pronounce the same stupid word for you . Most of the restaurants I visit in Flushing do n't have English-speaking staff . With this unit , I can pick a phrase ( from the limited choices ) and play it to them instead of butchering it myself . That 's the coolest thing ever , especially when they smile back because they 've completely understood you . It breaks the ice.Unfortunately , I ca n't give similar praise to the Japanese pronunciations . Most of the phrases sound like they 're spoken by a native Chinese speaker struggling to pronounce Japanese . It makes the Japanese sound very harsh and syncopated . What was a shocker to me was that many of the English words have not been translated to Japanese . Rather , they pretend to have translated it to Japanese , but it is still the same English word . Someone got super lazy . For instance , the Japanese pronunciation of `` sparkling wine '' is `` spaaaa-ARC-kay-ling viiiNE . '' Are you seriously kidding me ? It sounds like a native Chinese-speaking robot.I did not bother to test out the German or Romance languages extensively . The pronunciations in them sound a bit better and the list of phrases are definitely designed for visitors to the Euro countries.By the way , the interface is pretty lame . I do n't mind the low res text , but the phrases scroll painfully slowly . The buttons are not intuitive . I still have n't figured out how to set the time on this unit . It 's rather aggravating to use .	-1
The Nyrius Global Entourage7 certainly does not lack an extensive dictionary in a number of different languages.Unfortunately the sheer volume of phrases combined with a 1980 's era interface makes this thing nearly impossible to use as a quick means of communication.To make matters worse its single line screen simply ca n't display a full phrase without first a button push and then a painfully slow text crawl . The result is that you ca n't quickly scroll through the available options , as most of the available text reads `` Where is the.. '' or `` Does anyone h ... '' Even the most patient of good samaritans is not going to have time to wait for you to find the most appropriate phrase.But it is inexpensive , and I suppose as a device for a non-urgent situation that might require asking for specific items or help ( such as a hospital visit , etc ) it might be somewhat useful .	-1
I was really bothered that the Sams identical product was 30 % cheaper . The Sams tape also had more tape on each roll ! This req 2 hands to operate : one to hold the tape and the other to roll it out . The `` yellow '' dispensers hold the tape in such a way that only one hand is needed .	-1
Panasonic has a smaller footprint than this dinosaur , and results in sharper pencils , faster.My old Panasonic 's grindings container broke because I dropped it . It was four years old but far superior to this uninspired clunker .	-1
ORIGINAL REVIEW : I am a freak when it comes to using pencils- the tip ALWAYS needs to be sharp . For the few `` regular '' pencils I own ( I usually use mechanical ) , this sharpener will get the job done . However , it only gets three stars because 1 ) the motor chugs along- it sounds like it 's struggles to sharpen pencils- and I see other reviews state the same thing , so it 's not like I received a bum sharpener . 2 ) For the price ( or only a little more ) , I think you can definitely buy a better sharpener that you know will last awhile . I am skeptical on how long this thing will last.Overall , if the price drops ( currently $ 30 + shipping because it 's from a different seller ) and you 're looking for a decent , not-fancy sharpener , go with it . If it 's still around 30 , look elsewhere and see if you can find a better product.UPDATE 2/10/14 : I 've had this pencil sharpener in my classroom for awhile now , and my students use it all the time . It is less than impressive . First of all , it is loud . Second , it does NOT do good job of sharpening pencils . My students are at the sharpener for so long , and 8 out of 10 times , they give up and go to to the other pencil sharpener in my room ( which is not much better ) . At this point , I 've owned 3 different electric sharpeners . The best one I own , I keep at home : P. It isWestcott Axis iPoint Evolution Electric Pencil Sharpener for Home or Office ( 15510 ) and gets my pencil to a super sharp point , every single time . I would definitely recommend the Westcott over the X-acto any day .	-1
I was surprised at the cost of electric pencil sharpeners these days . My old electric Boston sharpener is almost 30 years old and still performs well . This one was acquired through Amazon 's Vine program for my unbiased opinion and review . The X-Acto blades are probably fine . The noisy part does n't last that long , they all make noise , but the sound of the motor makes one wonder how it will hold up . Be sure to read the warranty on that part.It 's a nice-looking product , sturdy and heavy . I , however , was not real impressed with its performance . I put in new pencils and it seemed to take forever each time . Blunt , but sharpened pencils did better . Starting from scratch just takes too long . I found myself helping it along by applying a little pressure to the end of the pencil . I still found that one side is sharpened down more than the other side , but maybe that is because of the pressure I was applying to the pencil ( ? ) The motor sounds like it is straining , and it does not shut down when finished , just keeps rolling the pencil around , so the `` pencil saver '' feature is apparently up to the users best guess . I just do n't think I could recommend spending $ 30+ dollars on this . It is an ok product for home use , but in a heavy business environment that uses old-fashioned pencils a lot ( as I do ) I would have some doubts .	-1
As some reviewers have mentioned here , the mini Tombow is problematic - the tape breaks and does not apply well . However , the Tombow regular sized Mono and the slimmer profile ( for pencil box storage ) Hybrid Mono correction tape work much better . Those versions are sold on Amazon also .	-1

Although I find this chair very comfortable to sit , it has a few problems.Let me first tell you what I really like about this chair.Comfortable seat : It has really soft cushion that feels very comfortable and cozy to sit on . I can sit on this chair for hours without feeling any discomfort.Easy assembly : The assembly was easy and intuitive . I was able to get this chair assembled in 15 minutes . It also feels very solid and durable.Now , here are some of the things that I do n't like about this chair.Adjustability : It does n't have a lot of options to adjust . Though it does lean back , it does not go far back to a comfortable lean . It stops at an awkward uncomfortable angle . Also , I do n't see any options to lock the lean midway or far back . It does have a locking mechanism to lock it from leaning but I would liked it better if it had the option to lock at different angles that I find comfortable.Quality of the fabric on the seat : Though the mesh fabric on the back is fine , the fabric on the seat is not durable . It has this mesh fabric that looks like it 's made from cotton and does n't look very sturdy and can easily tear if you 're not careful.If I was considering a chair in this price range , I 'd rather shop around because I can easily find other quality chairs at this price . The two stars are for the cozy seat cushion and the easy assembly .	-1
Everything about this chair is high quality , form the included screws and instructions to the fabric and feel of the rubber armrests . The seat cushion is very very comfortable.I have 1 problem with this chair : I 'm 5-6 and I have it at the lowest setting and my ( bare feet ) barely reach the floor . Wikipedia says average US male is 5-9.5 and average female is 5-4 . So why do chair manufacturers make chairs that exclude so much of the population ? So for me the adjustability means nothing ( relative to my desk and monitor ) since I 'm stuck at the lowest position for my legs to be comfortable . I know I 'm a short guy but most women are shorter than me , does that mean this chair is not for them either ? The other thing to note is that while you can adjust the tension for the back rest , the main cushion does not lean with the back ( in a good way ) .EDIT ( June 2012 ) changed star rating form 4 to 2 because the main cushion lost it 's cushionyness . I 'm on my computer all day so I used it all day for over and week and now it 's shaped like me and not nearly as comfortable as the first day or 2 . ( I weigh 185 lbs , if that makes a difference ) . I can see an impression of my ass on the cushion first thing in the morning before using the chair for the day.Ca n't recommend .	-1
I bought this at $ 6 . Pretty cheap . Still not worth it.It 's made cheap and it looks cheap . When it 's brand new it looks like it 's about to fall apart.You are better off getting a whiteboard at your local Walmart at a same price , because Walmart will have a way more quality product than this .	-1
There what you have to have to print . The only problem is they are so small . They work well but they do n't last very long .	-1
This will work well but it does n't have much ink . They should cost allot less if they are n't going to put much ink in them .	-1
This is what you need for printing . They are so small . There just is not much ink . They work well but they do n't last long .	-1
This did not work at all for me . I tried to use it to hang my small first aid kit in my truck on the textured plastic panel in back . Nope , no matter what I did it did n't stick , fell right off . The kit was not that heavy at all , a minor boo boo kit . I prepped the area well , and also did it it warm weather and nope , nothing . It also did not seem that sticky to me as other ones have , maybe I got a dud . Real disappointed . Hopefully it works for other applications . so far none . If it wont stick to warm trim in a car , wonder how it holds up outside in the cold ?	-1
Our office has 4 of these scanners.We have replaced all 4 of them along with a replacement unit . That 's right-we have had to have 5 total replacements . The scanner works great and efficiently-but then for some reason the FATAL ERROR would pop up on the machine and it would quit working overnight.We would get the replacements , but they were all refurbished . We just got a refurbished unit yesterday and it would NOT work . I spent over 2 hours on the phone with support trying to get a new unit and they finally gave in . Oh-they do not have a 800 number ! So it was a long distance call ! When we had to call in about the original units getting the FATAL error message , we were treated like we were dumb . Also-there was a language barrier.I would stay away from this product . It is not worth the time or the energy .	-1
These labels do exactly what they say : you can reposition them even after you have applied them to paper or envelopes.Great idea if you mess up a lot centering them on envelopes.For most people this is not really necessary as the first time they put it on is okay . Maybe for kids or for professionals who want to get the labels just right for clients it would be a good idea.The labels also do n't stick well initially and can curl up off the paper if you apply them to paper like cardstock or anything with a smooth shiny surface . You then must hold it down or really rub the label to make it stick . It gets old if you need to stick a lot of these labels to something .	-1
I researched this phone system on various web sites before buying it here , and they all say it has an option of an audible message alert . I 've spent a month trying to figure ours out , to finally give up and email Panasonic about how to set the alert to a beep or some audible sound . Panasonic responded and said this model does not have an audible message alert . Even though Amazon.com does n't say it has one , I bought it thinking it did based on so-called reliable sources such as CNET . It 's an important feature for us . So if an audible beep when you have messages is important to you , even though CNET and many other web sites list it as having it , do not be fooled -- there is no audible message alert . I ca n't believe Panasonic did not make that an option on this model , so I can not give it a rating above 1 because now we 're finding that it does n't even ring or make a tone everytime we get phone calls . Now it 's too late to return it to Amazon , so I 'm probably selling it on ebay .	-1
Maybe if you 're a super-techie you can set this up , but 3 of us have not been able to follow the instructions yet and I question whether we ever will . The problem seems to be with the paperwork , not the machine , but I have n't been able to figure it out .	-1
All the features are there ... but there are some annoying shortcomings with this unit . 1 ) The base set is so lightweight , it slides all over , and there 's no foam or rubber base to grip , 2 ) along those lines , the coiled cord from the base to the base handset is about 4 inches long . An exaggeration sure , but it 's way too short - turn your head and the base goes flying . I had to buy a new longer one . 3 ) The Phonebook feature does not update both ways between cordless handsets and base ... by that I mean you can add contacts book from cordless sets and they can update the base , but if you add at the base , they do n't show on the handsets . Plus , lower case letters in phonebook entries are seen as different words ( oh brother ! ) Oh , this is picky , but I do n't like the orange-ish color display . I knew that 's what I was getting , but I 'd prefer a green or blue . 4 ) As another reviewer noted , the volume on the speaker phone does n't go very high , so it 's basically useless as a `` speaker phone '' .Everything works , there 's not a single thing wrong , but there are some annoying drawbacks.Panasonic Dect 6.0 Metallic Gray Cordless/Corded Phone with Answering Machine ( KX-TG1062M )	-1
These labels are not a whole lot better than printing on plain paper . I still have to use scotch tape to make them stick . I was trying to save money and , as I tell my prospective clients , you get what you pay for . And I did . Now I 'm stuck with all these labels that are inferior . I suggest you spend a bit more money and buy Avery .	-1
I did n't find it particularly as much `` reduced effort '' as I had hoped for . It 's a perfectly fine product for what it is but I 've since purchased much more reduced effort staplers from other manufacturers since this purchase.As an aside and maybe I 'm being overly fussy , but this is primarily an office product ( at 70 sheet capacity ) -- so why did they make it with such a bright , unsightly orange ? ! ? ! ?	-1
When I first tried the stapler , I used about 50 magazine pages as a test . The stapler jammed . It continued to jam each time I tried it with anything , even when I was down to two pages . I called ACCO customer support , and after describing the issue they told me to return it or exchange it . I opted to return it . Although it 's possible that mine was an exception , the part that the staples come out of was not properly aligned with the recess on the bottom plate , leaving nothing to get the staple to bend on the bottom.A positive point is that it comes with a lifetime guarantee against jamming when used with the correct ( included ) staples . I ca n't say how likely it is to jam , but if yours stops working after a while , you always have the option of calling customer service . They answered on the first ring , which is a plus.You might also consider thePaperPro 60-Sheet High-Capacity Stapler ( 1200 ) , which has a capacity of fewer sheets ( 60 ) but works reliably and with very little force . Hopefully , the distribution of reviews will give you an idea of how well it works , under what circumstances it fails , and what remedy people had when it failed after owning it for a long period of time .	-1
I am very disappointed in this printer.Even though I configured the bottom tray as the default tray , it seems to steer itself to the upper one.Unbelievably , the upper tray has no back stop or back support for the paper . Photographs come out uneven ( they come out slanted by about 1-2mm ) , no matter what you do.Printer keeps going offline frequently , including via LAN , so the printing switches to my HP 7410 A-I-O.Unlike the 7410 , which itself was no prize , -it wo n't print the bottom 1/3 '' of some of my business forms.The software is buggy . The HP Solution Center keeps getting corrupted . The Windows Host Controller keeps shutting down since I installed the software.This is another poorly designed and thought out HP product . From what I understand , there is no comparable competing printer .	-1
Before purchasing this printer , be aware of the astronomical ink cartridge prices that will set you back $ 114 + tax/shipping for all four ( Black $ 35.99 , Cyan $ 25.99 , Magenta $ 25.99 , and Yellow $ 25.99 ) . The cartridges that come with the actual printer are only starter , low volume cartridges that will require replacement before you expect it . Even more aggravating , when you call HP 's tech support line , they will actually try to sell you more ink . I wonder why ? Sadly , HP provides the worst technical support that I have ever experienced . The telephone reps barely speak English ( even worse than other India-based tech support ) and the chat reps serve multiple customers at the same time , leading to long delays between their responses . Moreover , I have been cut off during chat sessions five times , which leads me to believe it is intentional as this always seems to happen when I attempt to corner them on difficult questions . Before getting cut off today ( 5/5/2009 ) the chat technical support rep acknowledged that there are known incompatibilities between the drivers and Windows XP . Presumably , this means the software was written for Vista .	-1
I posted a video review of this but it never made it on here for some reason.This line of HP printers has a known software bug - just google for `` HP Officjet Pro 8500 fake paper jam error . '' You 'll see pages upon pages of people complaining that there 's no fix for this - including people who actually repair printers . HP has acknowledged that there is no fix for this , yet there has n't been a recall or a driver update to address the problem.Avoid at all costs - it will work for about 6 months then develop an imaginary `` paper jam '' which paralyzes the machine . Tech support is terrible and incompetent .	-1
I 'll make this brief . It has some great wireless features , but two things make it completely worthless:1 . The ink runs out faster than you can believe . I rarely print in color , and the levels are still somehow low , constantly . HP is continuing their ploy to sell cheap printers and nail you on the back side with the ink . I think just about everyone is doing this now , so I ca n't even tell anyone which printer to buy without getting duped.2 . I remember my first few bubble jet printers could n't feed paper properly , back in 1995-97 . There is no excuse for that now . It usually says `` out of paper '' , until I go and force the top sheet into the feeder so it can grab it . Did I mention this printer is fairly new ? I hardly ever print.This is ridiculous . Do n't waste your money on ink . This is 2010 , they should have a printer that can feed paper .	-1
For the past 15 years , I 've purchased HP printers and have been very happy with the quality of their products- until now . I purchased this printer six months ago , and have been disappointed with its performance and features . I use this printer in my home office , and find that it is a bit noisy . If I want to print something I make sure I 'm not on the phone , or in a meeting . Print jobs often get `` stuck '' and will not process until you restart the printer- a time consuming event . In addition , the paper feed often gets jammed . The envelope printing feature is a disaster . The envelopes usually get stuck , or they will print with ink smudges . I also found their scanning feature lacking . If you scan a document , it will scan a regular sized paper into a huge file . Needless to say , I would n't recommend this printer for a home office .	-1
This printer was shipped to me with no outer brown box to conceal what I was getting ; a label was stuck onto the box that it comes in and there were huge pictures of the product with `` HP Printer '' printed all over it . You could see it on my porch from the next county . Anyone who might have been put off about stealing an ambiguous plain brown box might not have had any problem at all with stealing a brand new high end color printer from my porch , and Fedex did not even bother to knock to let me know something had been left . This may be because I got this from the Vine program , but even having gotten this product gratis I am very perturbed with the lack of discretion of the shipping department.This is not lightweight , it takes up more space than our multi-function 11x17 printer , theBrother MFC-5890CN , and it 's not going to replace it because we need the larger prints for client review plans . However , the print quality is vastly superior -- it has been on every HP printer I 've ever worked with or owned . Even line drawings on regular 8 x 11 sheets are super-crisp , and color photos and rendered 3D models look superb on even regular paper . This thing spits out text pages before I can turn around to reach for them , and no setting your egg timer and waiting for those crisp color images , either . I honestly did not expect the speed to match the print quality , but it surpassed anything I ever hoped for and beyond.Setting up is easy , but there are six different cartridges you have to put in . Four are ink cartridges -- separate colors means less waste , and HP makes it impossible to put the cartridges in the wrong way , or to put cyan in the magenta slot , and so forth . The ink slot is on the front -- easy to get to , easy to replace . The other two are printer heads that slip directly downward through the top of the printer . I am guessing that at some point these printer heads will need to be replaced ( never had to deal with these on a previous HP so I do n't know ) but what 's nice about them is that they have retractable handles on them so that they lift in and out easily , from fitted slots that make it impossible to put the wrong printer head into the wrong slot.Letting it set itself up after turning it on is a bit confusing since it was difficult to tell when it was done . It has to do this internal test stuff before you plug it into/connect it with your PC during the driver installation . I know everyone loves wireless , but the PC we 'll be using this with the most does not have wireless capability , and it would be nice if HP would include a 4 or 5 foot USB cable for this purpose instead of making us having to search for an extra or run out and buy one after getting set up to a certain point . It 's a little thing that could reduce a lot of initial customer frustration , even for those who have wireless capability and simply choose to use cables , or for those experiencing difficulties with wireless setup.The LCD touch screen is easy to use without picking up a manual . The only way to improve this would have been to make it tilt forward for using the printer on a higher shelf . It takes just about any kind of media card you can think of if you 're not printing from your computer , and gives all kinds of options to receive images , like email or sending directly to an image editing program on your PC . There is a junk fax blocker that comes with it , which is really nice , and an automatic email button . So I can scan and directly email it to someone if I had it directly connected to the network . Turning off the wireless is not complicated , but you do have to read the manual to know how ... if you do n't this will cause conflicts . Once it 's off , it functions fine . Printing on two sides is effortless and automatic , and can I just mention the quality and speed again ? No paper jams , so quiet ... it even LOOKS good.Mine is a small business , and if I did n't need 11x17 prints this printer would be at the top of my list as an investment for my needs for so many different things . It would be the only printer I own , and if it 's the only printer you ever own , you 'll be very happy with it.09/29/2010 UPDATE : This printer broke after about 18 months of light use 3 to 4 days a week . A gear inside a box deep inside the unit gave out . We had a professional repairman examine it , and the part was cheap . However , it was doubtful that he could get the part , and even if he could , the labor to take it apart and put it back together would equal or even exceed the cost of a new printer . I think the scanner on it still works , but we need a printer to PRINT . We were not printing hundreds of pages a day 24/7 on this and it should have lasted MUCH longer than what it did . It pains me to have to reduce the rating on this item to one star , but the use we got out of it is n't worth it . Either pass on this one or proceed with caution . I am honestly stunned that a Hewlett Packard printer failed like this so quickly .	-1
Do n't let the picture deceive you , the stapler looks all cute and a manageable size , but this thing is ridiculously massive . When I got it I was like , & # 34 ; Whaaaaa ? ! ? & # 34 ; It 's also really heavy ... .super big ... and super heavy . This is *not* a product that you are going to want for your home office ... this is definitely more like a corporate/business electric stapler . Beyond that , it 's & # 34 ; okay & # 34 ; at doing what it 's supposed to do , but I would never attempt to shove 45 sheets of paper into it ; it jammed a could of times with 25 sheets . So if you 're wanting to mostly staple really large documents look elsewhere , but really ... again ... the size for me was a total and complete turn off .	-1
The sharpener is very large and takes up a lot of real estate space on your desk . The performance leaves a lot to be desired , it wants to jam , points break off and have to be remove or dislodged . I would not buy this simply for the fact it ca n't sharpen well without problems but the size of it is a real turn off too .	-1
Bic are much better as far as cheap pens go . These stop working with nearly full ink . Anyone giving these a 5 star review must have bought them in the past week ... I have actually had a couple not work right after taking them out of the box unused .	-1
These labels are truly repositionable , even after a week of being stuck to paper . After two weeks they became harder to remove.My main concern however , is that they do not stick well to non flat surfaces . I tried to use these on Tyvek ( the plastic like envelopes ) that were stuffed full of clothing . The surface was not flat and the labels peeled up from the corners after application.They also peeled from the plain cardboard box I used , but not the boxes supplied by the Post Office that have a white paper coating.The adhesive seems to have a problem with some surfaces so use with caution . Not up to Averys usual standards .	-1
I see that these have great reviews and I wish that my review could also be a positive one . When I saw that Avery was offering up Repositionable Labels I was excited and decided to order for labeling my kiddies school notebooks and folders . After much chagrin , I have come to the conclusion that these truly do work as advertised but because of that do not seem to adhere to all surfaces the way other labels do.We have never encountered any issues with labels peeling off of anything until this batch . No matter how much I press and rub my fingers across - they still seem to peel at corners or the bottoms ! It has become a daily chore of checking my girl 's school folders/Mead composition books and re-pressing . The packaging states that they are repositionable and over time they will become permanent . Is that the problem ? ? Then why would I ever want to ship anything with a possible peeling label that has not `` cured '' itself into being permanent.Since I had such adhesion issues I was able to test the `` repositionability '' factor and they do indeed peel cleanly off ; the issue arose when they were n't as sticky the second time around as the first.Do I recommend them ? At this point and for my use ... no . I am beginning to wonder if there was an issue with the adhesive in my bunch after the glowing reviews from others .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , its a nice pen . But the refills cost more than the disposable pen with the same refill . So much for reducing waste .	-1
I really did n't think that a pencil sharpener could be so frustrating to people . This X-Acto is sturdy and generally sharpens properly but decided to fix a concept that did n't needing fixing.The problem is the self-feeding . It does n't always grab the pencil with the same amount of pressure . Sometimes , it takes a little more effort . Once it grabs the pencil , it wo n't let go easily . So , you need to really pull it out hard . As with most sharpeners , it may take a few attempts to get the right amount of point on the pencil . Each try takes extra effort and extra time.What is the point of the self-feeding ? It does n't seem to add any value at all , but it makes every attempt at sharpening more of an effort . It 's bizarre , and really aggravates the kids ( and some adults ) .	-1
Well , once again I find myself asking the eternal question : `` Why ca n't anyone make a pencil sharpener that lasts ? ! `` I really liked this at first -- the sharpener takes in the pencil , sharpens it automatically , then ejects it when it is finished . It seemed to do a pretty decent job of that ... until it did n't . A part of a pencil broke off inside of the sharpener , it would n't eject it , and then ... kaput.To sum up : PROS : - Nice auto-sharpening -- this makes sharpening `` hands free '' - It does n't over-sharpen -- pencils are sharp , but not so sharp that they break the tip off the second you begin to write- Has a metal sensor so a kid ca n't jam the eraser end in firstCONS : - Broke after 2 weeks of moderate use -- by ONE ADULT ( me ) ! - Auto feature sometimes goes crazy & eats up almost the whole pencil- `` Reverse '' button ( which you need if it goes crazy and wo n't stop eating up the whole pencil ) is ridiculously located UNDER , BEHIND the sharpener , by where the electric cord enters the sharpener ( ? ? ) Dumb location . You 'd never find it in a hurry.- Part of a pencil broke off inside -- and to my disbelief , there is NO WAY TO TAKE THE SHARPENER APART to go in and retrieve the broken piece ! I could n't believe it ... it just killed the sharpener . Everything I tried failed , and ultimately , the sharpener went into a mode where it stayed in reverse forever , unless it was unplugged . It just ran without stopping ... the motor began to get hot and smell -- this could really have turned into a fire hazard if it overheated.So all in all , while I liked it at first , COME ON , breaks after just TWO WEEKS ? ! And you can not take it apart to retrieve a broken-off piece of wood ? ? Lame . Waste of money . Look for a sharpener that mentions that it can be cleaned or have its blades sharpened , because that means you will be able to retrieve anything that breaks off inside of it.Note : I am a teacher , and I would NOT recommend this for kids . They 'd be pulling the pencils out when you 're not supposed to , etc . And the fact that the sharpener can get something stuck in it and run , run , run forever is just plain dangerous !	-1
First , the seat is not plush . It 's rather stiff and maybe needs breaking in . The arms are a bit too narrow for comfort , they should be wider . Assembly went OK , directions were OK . The material has a slight tear in the back , so Amazon gave me a partial refund . The workmanship overall is uneven . One side of the the back support is tucked in nicely , the other side is sloppy . Concerning the seat cushion , one seam is very good , the other side is wrinkled . It seems workers were in a hurry , so the appearance suffers . The overall comfort is fair , mostly because of the narrow arms . If you wear a jacket , you might not notice it . If you purchase this chair , do NOT throw away the box , because chances are , you 'll return the chair for a refund .	-1
These are labeled Office Tape ... Wrong ! Office Tape is 3/4 & # 34 ; wide . These are 1/2 & # 34 ; wide ... too smallI did not know how wide office tape was . I relied on specs and they say , & # 34 ; Office Tape & # 34 ; .This is Disposable Tape Dispenser Replacement Tape.I Know , Replacement Tape for Disposable Tape Dispenser ? Well if you get this tape that 's what it will fit in.It also came crushed in box .	-1
I really have no complaints about the print quality or the setup of the wireless function , which is a great convenience in a home network . The reason this printer is going to the recycler is the cost of operation due to HP 's decision to gouge consumers on replacement ink cartidges.If you look up the unit price on replacement cartridges , it does not sound unreasonable : roughly thirty USD for the black cartridge and twenty USD each for the three color cartridges . However , what you need to be aware of is that the printer decides when the cartridges need to be replaced and WILL NOT FUNCTION until you comply.This is a change from a few years ago , when you would receive a low ink warning but could still print until the cartridge actually emptied . This disabling of all print functions may be becoming a standard industry practice but , in my experience , is particularly egregious with this HP printer.It is no coincidence that all four cartridges are flagged as needing replacement at roughly the same time . Even if you have been printing only black and white draft copies in the interval since replacement , the color cartridges will be flagged as empty after a few months.As this happens , at the least , twice a year , you will be spending close to two hundred dollars a year to maintain even minimum function.After literally a mere few months , using the `` high-capacity '' XL cartridges and extremely rare use ( I rarely print more than a dozen pages per month ) , this printer is once again disabled due to an entirely fictitious low-ink warning . This function is clearly not triggered by actual use , the number of pages printed or the volume of ink remaining . It is based entirely on an algortithm combining some arbitrary time since cartridge installation and HP 's greed.Again : The resident software decides when you will replace the ink cartridges ( of which there are four ) and it will not print so much as a single page until you do.If you print enough pages in both black and white and color , and exhaust the cartridges in a short period of time , you may consider this printer a good value.Read many of the four and five star reviews carefully : `` I 've had this printer one month and I love it '' , `` I 've had it for one day ... '' , etc . I 'm happy for them , but I have owned this printer for fifteen months and am replacing it.This will be my last HP printer.UPDATE : I have received ( 11/18/2010 ) notice of a settlement offer in response to three lawsuits filed against HP alleging fraudulent practices related to the issues noted above . Quote : `` HP denies all these claims '' but will offer coupons redeemable at the HP online store ( only ) as compensation . One can therefore assume they intend to continue these practices . HP is offering an insulting maximum six dollar credit for qualifying printers . For more information : hpinkjetprintersettlement dot com	-1
I hate this printer . I hate it . I hate the HP Officejet Pro 8000.Now that I got that out of the way , I will admit that the print quality is good . That 's its one redeeming quality , and if it lasted for even the warranty period , that might be enough to garner at least a run-of-the-mill , 3 star printer rating . Unfortunately it does n't . In many cases , they do n't even last 6 months . It 's just not because of one hardware issue either . Sometimes the paper refuses to feed , in others the blue ink line will decide to explode , still in others the wires above the print heads ( held in place by a thin , swinging metal rod with a hook at the end ) will fall and get tangled up with the heads . There are so many things that are wrong with the 8000.See , I basically made the mistake of thinking that the HP Officejet 8000 would be a better choice than the Canon inkjets we were using at the time , which ended up being unusable without service after a year and a half ( due to the logistics of it , we just ca n't service an $ 80 printer , and the Canons and HP 's of the world know this ... that 's why they 're basically disposable at this point ) . After all , with a claimed duty cycle of 15,000 pages a month and good experiences with HP laser printers over the years , how could this possibly not be a better choice ? Ultimately , it all comes down to durability , namely , the 8000 has none . This is the Yugo of inkjet printers.I 've probably deployed 300 of these and the in-warranty failure rate is around 25 % . I realize that any mass-produced items are going to have a lemon or two in the bunch , but one in four ? That 's way too high HP . In most cases , this failures occur within 4-6 months ( and probably a third of them have issues as soon as they 're taken out of the box ) . The claimed duty cycle is a joke and the propensity for the 8000 to spew ink makes it a messy choice as well . This is probably due to the way the Officejets house the ink in the front of the unit and then feed it to the print heads via `` lines '' ( thin hoses basically ) .Other negatives include a very , VERY drawn out setup process ( where you 're basically forced to install a slew of pointless HP software that you 'll never use ) , the printer 's tendency to take forever to `` get ready '' to print ( it almost sounds like it has to `` bleed '' the lines ) and larger than average footprint , and there are much , much better choices out there . Unless you enjoy support and return authorization calls , steer clear of this disaster . As it is , I 'll continue to buy HP laser printers , but I 'll never buy another HP inkjet as long as I live .	-1
TO MY SUPRISE AND THE FACT THAT I HAVE FOUND OVER THE YEARS HP PRINTERS ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST IN MY EXPERIENCE , THIS ONE WAS A NIGHTMARE ! ! IT WAS AWFUL TO SETUP & WASTED TWO SETS OF FULL SIZE INK CARTRIDGES IN EVERY COLOR JUST IN THE SET UP AND PURGING PROCESS , GETTING BUBBLES OUT OF THE LINES , ETC . A REAL PAIN ... HP MAKES A VARIETY OF ALL IN ONE PRINTERS MUCH EASIER , SMALLER AND NICER THAN THIS ONE & I GOT ANOTHER ONE SINCE THAT 'S A DIFFERENT STYLE BUT SO MUCH BETTER . IT 'S ALSO LARGE WITH A HUGE TRANSFORMER WHICH MEANS SO IS THE ELECTRICAL DRAW . DO N'T BUY THIS MODEL ! !	-1
We were in love with this printer when we first purchased it . It broke within three months ( continued to report that there was no paper loaded , despite there being plentiful paper there ) . HP was good about replacing it promptly . It prints text FAST . The problem is getting to the point that it has started printing . As others have mentioned , it takes this printer eons to initialize . Sometimes , it even decides to reset at completely random times . And the noise ... you 'd think it was about to spew plastic and metal parts out the paper hole with the intensity of churning and grinding you hear . Then there is the continued `` finickiness '' with regard to loading paper . You 've got to position it just right or suffer the blinking `` paper out '' light.And then there is the ink . As others have mentioned , there was a class action suit against HP because they did n't make it clear how ink was used by certain printers . This causes most users to go through their colored ink faster than they should . For example , with this printer , even though you may be printing a simple black and white text document , you have to click through four settings ( Properties/Features/Print in grayscale/Black Ink Only ) to ensure that no colored ink is used in printing your simple black and white document.The things this printer gets right ( solid wireless performance straight out of the box and fast printing ) are vastly overshadowed by all the hassle we 've had to go through to get things done.Again , as others have mentioned , HP denies all allegations yet has settled the suit . Because of my personal experience with this `` feature '' , we will be avoiding HP products in the future .	-1
I 've used this close to a year and am very disappointed in it . It simply will not print on both sides after awhile . It may at first but that wo n't likely last . And getting help from HP is just out of the question . Their support isn't.The printer works and then it does n't . The ink is expensive and it uses a lot of it -- - even when all you use is black ink.I 'm going to use up the ink I have on hand and then invest in another brand printer . I wo n't buy HP again.Not recommended. -- Susanna K. Hutcheson	-1
I purchased the 8500 from HP because it was on sale , but the first one that arrived did not scan or copy and HP promptly exchanged it . When I received the new exchange , it had a weird noise like a really loud hard disk . When tech support assisted me with my install problems , they spent quite a while going over my PC and deleted a bunch of stuff from my computer , then when I could n't get it to send scanned images via email my PC crashed and had to use the recovery disks . Good think I back things up . With a fresh software install on my PC , it finally worked fine , but the noise was still there . I then got an email for the 8500 premier wireless and did an exchanged for it . I 'm so happy I did because the premier works great and it worked on the first try .	-1
I have owned three of these printers over four years -- now that this model , bought two years ago has gone bad I will not buy HP again . These printers are tricky to maintain , have high ink prices and when you switch to new cartridges , which are VERY expensive ( and you need four ) the printer often does not recognize the new cartridge . There is also no FREE customer support . I just spent more than $ 100 on ink cartridges and the printer refuses to recognize them , keeps saying , replace empty cartridge .	-1
Horrible printer will never get and HP inkjet again . Stops in the middle of printing to check the machine.Takes 3-4 minutes to resume printing . Hate this printer go Brother all the way ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Note that ink for this printer will set you back One Hundred and fourteen dollars ! ! ! Before purchasing the Officejet 8500 , be aware that there appears to be compatibility issues with the current drivers ( as of 5/5/2009 ) and Windows XP . Basically , the user gets the following error : `` The printer has not yet responded , but the Microsoft Office program may be able to proceed without printer information '' . I have spent hours on the phone with their India-based tech support and with their chat technical support . Sadly , HP provides the worst technical support that I have ever experienced . The telephone reps barely speak English and the chat reps serve multiple customers at the same time , leading to long delays between their responses . Moreover , I have been cut off during chat sessions five times , which leads me to believe it is intentional as this always seems to happen when I attempt to corner them on difficult questions . Before getting cut off today ( 5/5/2009 ) the chat technical support rep acknowledged that there are known incompatibilities between the drivers and Windows XP . Presumably , this means the software was written for Vista.Also be aware of the astronomical ink cartridge prices that will set you back half the cost of a new printer.This is the third HP multifunction printer I have purchased . Historically , I have purchased top-of-the-line models from the HP Officejet line for my home office . Generally , I have been rather pleased and impressed with their ability to work for years with few paper jams , either in the printer or document feeder . My primary complaints with HP and these printers are twofold : 1 ) the ink prices are exorbitant ( i.e . pay as you go ) and 2 ) HP has atrocious tech support . The Officejet 8500 appears to have all-around better construction than the other HP Officejet multifunction printers I have owned . Yet it has n't been without problems.Looking back at my other purchases , it is striking how much prices have come down . Yet HP continues to gouge its customers on ink with the four cartridges costing $ [ ... ] + tax . The first Officejet ( d155xi ) worked almost flawlessly for three years . I finally decided to sell it when moving . The second Officejet ( 7310xi ) worked extremely well until one day it would not power on . Apparently , something had gone wrong with its main processor . The printer was on a surge protector the entire time , so I have no idea why this happened . I do turn the surge protector off every day before going to work to save electricity as this severs vampire loads from the electrical system . Perhaps the on/off cycles were not good for the printer . After determining the 7310xi was beyond repair , I purchased an Officejet 8500 from HP direct . The printer appears to be well made , but it has problems with communicating with my notebook in addition to having issues with photo printing that have been not fully resolved.The timeline of my Officejet purchases:2002 - March Officejet d155xi ( HP Direct ) 800 + tax/shipping2006 - March Officejet 7310xi ( Sam 's Club ) 368 + tax2009 - April Officejet 8500 ( HP Direct ) 269 + tax/shipping -fifty buck trade-in rebate for 7310xiThe 8500 does not come with a USB cable , which was not an issue [ at first ] since I have so many surplus cables . Apparently , the 16ft cable I used with the 7310xi was not compatible , possibly because it may have been a USB 1.0 version , which I ca n't determine . So I tried one of the dozen or so shorter USB cables I have , some of which were in fact USB 2.0 . While I got the printer to work , I repeatedly get errors such as `` The printer has not yet responded , but the Microsoft Office program may be able to proceed without printer information '' . So , I purchased a new 16ft . Belkin USB 2.0 . Unfortunately , I still get the same errors and freezing of the computer . I have not resolved the problem and do n't look forward to calling HP 's tech support . Their Indian support reps have the worst English I have ever had to deal with in a tech support setting . I do appreciate their new chat tech-support option , which allows the customer to select his skill level such as `` novice '' or `` expert '' . Yet , the chat sessions abruptly severed communication with me multiple times with a red warning message , `` we are having technical problems , please call tech support '' . What a ridiculous headache ! PRINTER DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITYDespite HP 's less than acceptable tech support , HP 's engineers deserve credit for improving the design and build quality of their multifunction printers . Even though the previous printers never had a problem with broken paper trays or document feeders , these plastic pieces seemed extremely flimsy . The 8500 seems to be better constructed in that thicker , rigid plastic was used . Additionally , the parts that require interaction by the user , such as the receptacles for the ink cartridges , are much more accessible.SPEEDWhile I have not conducted a side-by-side test , both printing and scanning appear to be faster than my most recent Officejet prior to this one , the 7310xi . Despite the increased speed , the 8500 does n't shake my printer stand as violently as the 7310xi did , suggesting the engineers used a lower-inertia print head . The scanning appears slightly faster , but really not fast enough for large jobs . Truthfully , I would pay a lot more for much faster scanning . I have a grown accustomed to using a Ricoh 6500 copier/printer/scanner at my day job . The ~50 page/minute scan to pdf capability really changes the utility of the printer.STILL NO DOUBLE SIDED SCANNINGOne of the features that really attracted me to the original Officejet was its double-sided printing capability . Unfortunately it does n't provide true double sided scanning . Some of scan options suggest the 8500 can perform double sided scanning but this appears to be more of function to interleave the second ( back ) set of pages . For larger double-sided documents , I find myself using the industrial strength Ricoh 6500.PRINT QUALITYThe black text quality appears to be slightly better than that of the 7310xi . In fact , it appears indistinguishable from laser print quality . However , there have been some problems printing in color . First , when printing on plain white paper on regular ink volume settings , the colors appear a bit less vivid than the prints I made with my 7310xi . In fact , I have a few samples of color documents printed on the 7310xi that I was able to compare side-by-side with the output of the 8500 , which clearly showed the difference between the two prints . Yet , this may be a result of HP 's strategy to market this printer as being more ink efficient.When printing on photo paper , there appears to be some issues when selecting the photo quality settings and `` HP Advanced Photo Paper '' as the paper type . Using both HP photo paper and Kodak `` everyday '' photo paper , there were striations across the center of the page . It is n't clear if the HP photo paper I was using was truly their `` advanced '' paper as this was a sample pack from HP . When using the `` other photo paper '' option , there were no striations . With certain other papers , however , I found that the ink would run with the slightest exposure to water - even after drying for more than one hour . Barely visible drops of water would cause easily visible spots on the page . While it is n't clear precisely what was done with the ink and requisite paper compatibility , the 8500 does appear to be more fickle than the predecessors.In summary , the 8500 appears to be better designed and constructed than previous Officejet models but is less user friendly . My guess is that many of the problems I am experiencing will be resolved when new drivers are made available . However , as a fairly technical user , I would not expect so many difficulties getting the printer to work . Moreover , HP 's consumer tech support is so unforgivably bad the company does not deserve your business.Cons : *Tech support is totally unacceptable , off-shore reps have both a poor command of the English language and weak technical skills*Online chat tech support is disjointed with reps chatting with multiple customers simultaneously*Printer communication problems unresolved as of 5/5/2009*Photo printing requires more adjustments of settings*Still does n't have a true double-siding SCANNING mechanism*Drivers for XP seem to have compatibility issuesPros*Fast printing and scanning for a piece of home office equipment*Sturdier construction than predecessors*Reasonable price for the performance/functionality*Smoother/quieter than previous Officejet printers	-1
I did not buy my unit from Amazon but instead bought it local retail and have been using it for 6 months . Review below : Pros : - Very nice looking machine- Sturdy , quality build- High quality printing , scanning , copying- Great overall optionality and functionalityCons : - Terrible software that bugs out constantly , I 'm always having to reboot and troubleshoot to see why the printer is n't printing- Software also has some compatibility issues with Windows 7 auto print drivers , I could n't get the printer drivers working on one of my laptops , still ca n't till this day- Really slow startup time , everytime you power down and back on the startup process of the hardware is painfully long- Power button is such that you can not have it turn on and off with your master switch if you use a power strip or UPS for your entire workstation , you need to turn it on separatelyWhile I like the machine a lot when it 's actually working , the constant downtime and bugging out have caused me to start searching for an alternative . Such a pity considering I spent so much money on this one . Considering HP is the World leader in printing and the 8500 is touted as their premium home office all-in one product , you would think they and their army of engineers could have done better here .	-1
Worst printer I have ever owned . I will never buy an HP printer again . I read the reviews before purchasing , and they were better than the 2 1/2 stars shown here . At first , it was pretty okay . We never could get the wireless to work . My husband is great at setting up wireless , computers , etc. , but not on this . Since the printer was basically next to my desk anyway , we just used a USB cable . The print and speed was fine . The NOISE is terrible . It seems like it needs to calibrate or something on a regular basis . That was bothersome . I probably should have taken it back , but never did . I had it less than a year and then all of the sudden it just stopped printing . I looked online and saw that there were lots of people having the same issue . It was the printer head issue . So , I was basically done with it . Easier to buy another one , but NEVER an HP again ! I highly recommend you thoroughly read reviews before you purchase . Buyer beware !	-1
I 've owned a lot of printers over the years . Most recently inkjet printers from Epson , Canon , and HP . Even though this printer has more capabilities than most of the printers I 've owned , it 's probably been the most frustrating one that I 've owned for a number of reasons.o It 's a bear to use . They 've crammed so much functionality into it ( most of which you 'll never use ) that the UI is just ridiculous . Buttons , buttons , and more buttons everywhere . I feel like I 'm piloting an airplane everytime I try to interface with that thing.o The wireless networking feature works really poorly . I was originally excited by this feature . I have several computers in the house , and have a wireless router . The problem is that the printer frequently gets `` lost '' and for whatever reason decided not to join your network periodically . Then you have to bring out the USB cable , and re-initialize all the settings . After having to do this a dozen or so times I finally got fed up and just plugged it into the ethernet instead . That has worked *much* more reliably , but it is less convenient.o the power-saver functionality works really poorly . Probably the most frustrating thing about the printer is what it does when you leave it on for a while . HP obviously put some consideration in to saving energy , which is fine , but it has bad side effects . If you leave it on for a half hour or so , it will power itself down into some kind of power saving mode . The problem is that it does n't waken from that mode ! The only remedy seems to be to power-cycle it , at which time it often scolds you for doing so.o out of the box , it does n't work with system 7 . This was a surprise to me , since I bought this printer in 2010 , months after system 7 was shipped , and this was one of HP 's newest printers . Fortunately , they came out with updates on their website that you can now go get . Still , it makes the cd that comes with the system worthless as anything but a very small frisbee.o The ink sensors are not reliable . I 'm also frustrated with these . On the canon printers for example , there is a really clear display that shows you the status of the ink . On HP , the display ( like everything else ) is ambiguous and deceiving . It 's been telling me that it is out of ink for weeks now , yet all the pages I print out continue to be flawless . I guess the synic in me says that they do n't mind so much in being `` convervative '' in their ink estimates and having you throw out your cartridge long before you actually need to in order to sell you more ink . But who knows , maybe it 's simply a legitamite defect.All in all , this printer has too many warts for me to recommend . My next printer will probably be a Canon .	-1
After one bad experience resulting in a return , I decided that maybe I just got a lemon . So I bought another one . After a month , back it goes as well.The first printer would n't play nice with my WEP encryption on my linksys wireless network . After 4 hours and some customer service phone time , I ended up having to comvert my wireless network to WPA2 encryption . I should have done that long ago anyway , but the printer is supposed to be able to use WEP and simply could n't on my network despite no problem with any other hardware . That was a minor annoyance , but I thought those were behind me . I replaced my router between the first and second printers , so my issues can be identified to be independent of my router.Driver and software installation on my computers ( 2 running windows vista 64 bit , 1 running Vista 32 bit , and 1 running XP ) was a snap both times . I could print easily , most of the time . About 10 % of the time when I went to print only about half the document would print and then nothing . The printer would n't shut down , would n't advance the paper , would n't cancel the print job . This happened on both printers . It happened intermittently from all of my different computers . Technical support had me uninstall and reinstall drivers and software . Still happened occassionally . The only way to restart the printer was to unplug it . Most of the time , it printed like a champ . Quick , quiet , and with good quality . But then about once a day it all came to a screeching halt.Scanning worked great about half the time . Sometimes scanning would work just like it should . Put the document in , scan , and the image appears on the computer in the quality and format selected . But the other half of the time , either half an image would appear or no image would appear.Two bad and similar experiences . Perhaps I just got 2 lemons . Perhaps the vast majority of the printers work great . But if I got two bad ones in a row : Buyer beware.I ended up buying aCanon PIXMA MX870 Wireless Office All-in-One Printer ( 4206B002 ) and love it . No issues , just works .	-1
They are durable like stated on package but they were hard to write on them and a smearing problem also . I was excited seeing these I thought I could redo my files but more work than it was worth.Skip !	-1
These durable filing tabs are a fanstastic idea that needs more work.What I like about them is : - These tabs are tough . It was as if I put a binder separator to mark the pages of my book.- The lower portion is clear so it did not cover any writing on the page I stuck it to unlike their other productPost-it Note Tab , 3.37 x 2.75 Inch , Green and Blue ( 2200-GB ) .- I was able to remove the tab easily and without any damage to the page.- I was able to write both on the colored and clear part of the tab.What I really dislike is : - I used a ballpoint pen to write on both the top and bottom of the tab and the top part smeared even after 20 minutes of drying . Yet the clear part never smeared.- The cost is almost .17 cents per sheet and there are only 24 per pack at the current price of $ 3.99.If Post-it solved the smearing problem , I would have rated this product 4 stars ( taking off 1 star for the high cost ) . If they solved both the smearing problem and lowered the cost to about $ 2.00 per pack , I would have rated this product 5 stars because these easily turn a book , binder , file folder , etc . into a nicely separated `` document '' without the expense of having to purchase binder separators . However , because the ink smears for about 30 minutes after writing on the top part of the tab , I would n't even consider purchasing these until they have been reengineered . Personally I do n't like the messy look of smeared ink not to mention the difficulty in reading smudgy writing .	-1
Now they got you paying over $ 100 for tiny ink cartridges . My PCS-1610 has lasted over 5 years . That 's a record for an HP printer.Nada	-1
We have used Canon scanners for 20 years in our business . All worked more or less the same . `` Improvements '' in this model have about driven us crazy : you can not set the scanner to 'multi-crop ' permanently ... .you have to preview and rescan every time to make this work . finding the correct output program for the images , in order to edit and save , has also proved problematic . We bought this because we did not want to learn an entirely new system , but in effect we have had to anyway . Maybe this is perfect for you , depending on your needs but for us it has turned into a nightmare .	-1
Canon 's tech support gratefully , responded today . User error for front feeding of paper by my not shoving the paper into the viscera of the printer.Am I happy with this printer ? I really wish I was . The print quality is grand . The slowness is incredibly annoying . Oh my stars this thing is s-l-o-w.I still wish I would have purchased an Epson . At least my expectations would n't be as high as they were for this monstrosity . I purchased in 9/27/10 here on Amazon . Maybe I will sell it here as well . It works , I have n't printed much on it and still the ink is being sucked down . I 'm serious , I have n't printed much more than MAYBE 10 b/w documents , and maybe 10 color printed things . All were on 8.5 '' x 11 '' paper . Oops , one picture on high quality photo paper.I ramble ... I 'm just really disappointed.Glad the rest have had a grand experience.Lastly , there are a phenomenal number of printers in the `` used '' section which are listed as `` new in the box but UPC removed '' .2/18/11 - This is such an annoying piece of junk . I must have purchased the a lemon , it is really a pain .	-1
This printer has a lot of features ( copying , scanning , faxing , duplex printing , duplex auto-feed ) for the price , but you will end up paying an arm and a leg in ink costs if you use it very often.Like : - Image and scan quality ( consistent w/ Canon 's usual great performance ) - Auto feed duplex scanning : you can easily scan or copy a stack of paper- Duplex printing : great paper saver- Dual tray loading ( rear and cassette ) Dislike : - Wireless setup is a major pain . They need to rework this . It is unnecessarily hard ( ! ) - Ink usage , even with light use , is very high.I 've owned canon products for years and thought this `` business '' class machine would be a little more reasonable on ink usage . Our office uses a full set of ink every two months or so . This is really a deal-killer in the long term , and brings a 5-star printer down to 2 or 3 stars.Update : The worst part is that if a color cartridge is out , you ca n't even use the thing . No scanning . No black and white printing . I 'm giving this thing away on craigslist for free I think .	-1
It 's no wonder Canon took so long to come up with wireless printers -- they had no idea of what they 're doing . I got this MX860 the other night and there are about 60 pages on how to setup one 's network . Apparently , one can not setup the network from the printer and printer screen , as they could with normal printers like Brother , HP , etc.You have to start a USB connection and run an install program that runs as slow as dirt to run wireless on this printer . This is like starting a jet by pulling it by horses . It baffles the imagination that Canon could make this so convoluted and over-complicated . In addition to that Canon fills up your computer with garbage.It loads up about five programs into your startup tray , which bogs down your computer , and really serves no purpose at all.No thanks ! This baby is shipping back and I 'll look at a company that knows how to make a printer like Brother or Epson .	-1
While the print quality and speed is decent on this machine , there is a huge problem when scanning or copying.If you try to COPY any photo , business card , or any other document that does not have a margin ( where text or images stretch to the very ends of the document ) , the top and left sides are cut off between 1/8 '' and 1/4 '' ! If you copy an 8.5 '' x11 '' document that does n't have any margins , the bottom and right sides are cut off by even more than 1/4 '' ! If you try to SCAN that same document ( without moving it from the scanner glass ) , the top and left sides are cut off by 1/8 '' , and the bottom and right sides are ok.This means that if you wish to scan something smaller than letter-sized ( like a photo ) , you have to remember to NOT place the document in the upper-left corner of the glass as instructed ... instead you have to remember to move it off the corner and then manually crop it . This also means that if you have to copy or scan an entire 8.5 '' x11 '' document that has no margins , you 're out of luck.I 've had a number of scanners , copiers , and multi-function machines in the past by manufacturers like Samsung and HP and I have never had this issue . No adjustments can be made to fix the problem . And unfortunately , this is not a problem that can be fixed by a driver or software update ... it is a huge flaw in the design of the hardware itself.Some people may not find this to be a problem for them , but for me , it 's a deal-breaker . I 'll be using a different all-in-one ... one that can scan and copy an entire 8.5 '' x11 '' without getting cut off !	-1
Interesting ... .I thought the person who warned me about `` reasonably priced '' printers that lure you in and then condemn you to a lifetime of outrageous toner costs was cynical . Now I know he was a friend ( okay , a son ) . Absolutely outrageous what Canon charges you for the itty-bitty replacement cartridges which run out the moment you look at them . Even more expensive if you buy them color-by-color . Unethical is another word that comes to mind .	-1
Wow . I 've owned dozens of printers over the years , but until I bought a Canon MX860 , I 'd never have believed that an inkjet printer could go through a $ 14 cartridge after outputing just 40 pages ! ! In fact , my printer is indicating that BOTH black cartridges are spent . Granted , you 'll get more pages per cartridge if you use the printer more frequently than I do . But still -- forty pages for the occasional user ? And wait till you see how tiny the ink reservoirs is for the egregiously overpriced , # 221 cartridge : nine milliliters , down from 14ml , according to another review on this site . What a brazen scam ! My solution is to buy the cheapest ink that works , and to use the printer for as long as the print head can tolerate inkdom 's version of $ 2-buck Chuck .	-1
There are several nice things about this multi-function unit and I really do like its scanning capability and PC interface ( much MUCH better than a similarly priced HP ) . I had no problems with set up or functioning . My concerns and complaints are that it is very slow to print and - as other reviewers have noted - it gulps ink like crazy . I 've printed fewer than 500 pages ( less than 25 % coverage ) and the `` big '' black ink cartridge needed replacement . This was purchased for my office and I 'm returning it . I was contemplating one for my home but I 'm so glad I did n't order another .	-1
Do n't try using these in the freezer . They do n't stick , or in the refrigerator or on anything that has any moisture in it .	-1
disappointed , didnt work , delivered in a timely fashion , but , cartridges did n't work . waste of money . May be it 's canon 's software that 's not letting these generic cartridge work .	-1
So far all the smaller color ones work but was very disappointed to find that 2 of the 3 large black inks fit and appear right but are n't recognized by my printer and so basically are garbage .	-1
The battery that came with this phone lasted a few years . This replacement battery ( two of them in 2 handsets ) lasted about 5 months . Now it runs dead after about 10 minutes of use , and wo n't fully recharge .	-1
I got one of these under a year ago ... I have 5 of these phones ... all with the original batteries except for one that had to be replaced ... well , guess which one stopped working out of the blue ? This one ... buy a better quality battery and save money in the long run . These batteries are n't worth the print that is on them .	-1
I did n't have much luck with these batteries , they died quickly and the ones that are n't completely dead lose their life so fast , you ca n't even have them off a charger for a day , and I often have to switch phones during long conversations . Not good .	-1
I ordered 5 of these and I seem to have gotten less than a year of use out of them . They 're already dying on me and refusing to hold a charge . Not worth it .	-1
I returned this battery to Amazon without even trying it . It was not as pictured , was dirty and possibly used . What is shown is not what you will get . You get a battery pack with a stick on label . The label was dirty and torn indicating to me that this could have been a return . If you need one of these batteries , buy a Uniden battery not one of these imitations .	-1
CONS : there is NO BUILT-IN ANSWERING MACHINE OR VOICEMAIL feature.The picture on the Amazon site shows a `` voicemail '' light/button so I thought the base or handset included this feature . It does not -- if someone calls this phone it will ring forever.So I 'm not sure what the voicemail light is for , maybe it 's for the households who use their phone companies digital voicemail.PROS : lightweight modern handset , speakerphone , different ringer tones/volumes.Because I 'm returning the product right away I did n't get a chance to make any calls so I ca n't comment on that.I found out later that this company makes a different model that does include an answering machine , I 'm going to buy that instead .	-1
I ordered a CS6219 and I got an entirely different model ( CS6124 ) . Um , Im not sure why I got the wrong item , but this one will not work with my existing handsets .	-1
I learned the hard way that the base unit of this phone system does not use a back-up battery ( something Amazon.com does not disclose ) . So , everytime the unit comes unplugged , which happens unbelievably easily , or your power goes off for only seconds , it erases the time and date and greeting . What a pain in the neck , and I paid $ 98 for this system . I called At & t because I just could not believe the base unit would not have back-up power -- surely I just had n't been able to find it , but they confirmed that it does not . This is nothing but an overpriced piece of junk foisted upon the unsuspecting public at a grossly high price .	-1
its nothing special . . the ad is misleading . the display does not light up . back of hand set is awfull . if you touch one of the buttons on back hand set you get cut off . . it made cheap . and price is to . if lasts me a month ? il be lucky and il def . get something worth it . there was no packing slip enclosed . ! the phone is not made by AT & T ! not a worth while item .	-1
When I unpacked the phone I realized that it was missing the piece of plastic that will hang up the phone . There should be a plastic piece to depress the button on the receiver , however as it was shipped to me it does not ever hang up when you `` hang up '' the phone . I had to return it .	-1
Very poorly designed . When you hold the receiver in your right hand , in a way that is natural for the average person , your fingers automatically hit the buttons they inconveniently placed on the outer side of the receiver . I was on the phone and hit the flash button repeatedly even though I was well aware the button was there and was trying to avoid it . You ca n't avoid it unless you want to put your hand in a very odd position , and get cramps . No kidding . In order to hold the receiver and not hit the flash button you have to cramp up your hand into an odd position and hope you do n't drop the phone.And you can not place the phone on your shoulder to hold it , if you temporarily need to use both hands for something else . And , for those of us who still use an attachable shoulder cradle ( a.k.a . shoulder rest ) , you can not attach it to this phone due to the buttons on the outside of the receiver.I do n't want to be mean , but honestly , the person who designed this phone should be fired.Outgoing sound was bad - the person I was talking to reported a hissing noise.Incoming sound was actually good , but that does not make up for the fact that holding the phone , what should be the simplest thing to do , ca n't be done comfortably.And just as an FYI - I 've tried them all ; VTECH 265 , ATT 265 , and ATT 1909AT & T ; 265 - Trimline Telephone with Caller ID & Call WaitingVTECH COMMUNICATIONS INC 265 WHT Trimline Telephoneand they are all the same design - do n't get any of these if you want to be able to comfortably hold the phone , let it rest on your shoulder , or use a shoulder cradle ( a.k.a . shoulder rest ) . See my photos of this ATT 1909 for an example of what I mean.If you want a very simple corded phone I can tell you the ATT Trimline 230 has worked well for me for about 20 years . The 230 model is now called theAT & T ; Corded Trimline Phone with 13-Number Memory ( 210 ) , slightly modified . I 've just ordered some 210s , for my MagicJacks , and I 'll be sure to review them , to see if they are as good as the 230s use to be .	-1
Nice product apart from being completely ruined by one idiotic design feature.Every time you `` miss '' a call ( including picking it up from another phone ! ) , it will flash the call info light indefinitely.Net result is that you have a distracting flashing light constantly on your desk . What on earth were the designers thinking ?	-1
Whenever a product has `` high quality '' in the title , I suspect they are protesting too much . In this case , way too much . My phone arrived with a completely nonfunctioning `` 3 '' button.I 'd say AT & T ; is going downhill , but they have absolutely nothing to do with this phone other than receiving a royalty payment for having their name defiled by the Chinese company that is actually making and selling these ( VTech ) . Here 's my guess as to the cost breakdown of this device , per unit : $ 2 royalty payment to AT & T ; $ 1 plastic case $ 1.50 electronics $ 1 buttons 0-2 & 4-9 $ 0.2 button 3 ( management-consultant-directed cost savings after market study showing 85 % of people using a land line do n't have any friends with a `` 3 '' in their number ) $ 0.25 child labor $ 2 graft to local Chinese government officials to escape prosecution for violating child labor laws $ 8 corporate management salaries $ 4 brand marketing consultantsEnjoy this brave new world of High Quality !	-1
The phone itself is n't that bad . You can hear clearly and it has an indicator light when someone else is on the line . The hold button is a nice feature . However , the speaker feature is horrible . You ca n't hear anyone clearly and the caller Id display is horrible to read . You pratically have to be on top of it to see who 's calling . After 2 months I have replaced it because I need something with a good speaker . I do n't recommend it if those negatives are important to you .	-1
The first 3 color cartridges installed were not recognized by the printer . Removed and reinstalled several times to noavail . Contacted the seller and they asked us to try 3 more cartridges , same result . None of the six cartridges wererecognised or asked for an alignment test . Seller said they would issue a prepaid return tag and give us a refund.They were shipped back two weeks ago , and have n't seen a refund yet . Tried calling 3 times Friday 9/9 no answer . If wedo n't hear from them by Monday 9/13 we will work through our credit card for a refund . Looking at the site today togive feedback I find that the same cartridges we paid $ 28.60 for are now $ 16.74 ?	-1
We 've been using these for a hotel that I own and it felt like either someone was stealing these or they were going through them too quickly - so we dated them , tracked the number of pages , and yep , they lasted only 1200 pages each . Argh .	-1
I order in bulk and the first defective one I got I thought was a fluke . But later I had another on my hands . The little white plastic widget on the side does n't move at all . You get what you pay for . A total waste of money and shipping charges .	-1
I like the button on pencil shaft and the idea of a twist eraser , but as you erase , the eraser rotates and retracts back into the pencil . Annoying design flaw .	-1
I was hoping for something a little more substantial . It did n't quite fit a double mattress , and it did n't leave me feeling that it would protect the mattress from much of anything . I guess something is better than nothing , but next go around , I would look for something that is marketed to be a little thicker and tougher . I also would n't use this on a full mattress .	-1
First , I love this scanner when it works . However I have terrible problems with it feeding in more than 1 page at a time , and YES , I patiently go through each page of paper trying to ruffle it a little on the edges so that it will be easier for the machine to feed just one page at a time . Even doing this I still have problems again and again , and I waste too much time babysitting it . I thought that I just got a bad machine , so I sent my first s1500 back and got a replacement ( I was still in the warranty period ) , but while the replacement machine is a little better , I still have to refeed pages over and over again .	-1
Stated that `` Drum '' ( a piece that the cartridge is `` inserted into '' and then totality is placed into into the printer 's cartridge slot . Now my printer works and does not jam paper.Someone at Amazon should understand what it is they 're selling ; the Brother website has a link to Amazon and makes no mention of the `` Drum '' either.Read this over again and save yourself some money and frustration . Spent all day yesterday in a downtown store to figure this one out ; after 3 TN-650 cartridges that did nothing but cause paper jams it 's `` another '' part not spelled out in the reviews and instructions ; at least the Hewlett-Packard spends money on their technical writing staff .	-1
There is no doubt that for a small , plastic device there is a lot of information at your fingertips but accessing it can be difficult . The keyboard is tiny and not easy to navigate . The screen is hard to see and , although it has the ability to increase your font size , you can not increase font sizes before you reach the word you are looking for . All of your search screens remain small and hard to read.The cover on my dictionary would catch each time I opened it . The speaker sounds very tinny ( what you would expect for a small plastic device ) so whether you can get an accurate pronounciation from it is questionnable.If you want a spanish-english dictionary that can fit in your pocket , have good eyesight , and like to have a lot of information available at your fingertips , this just might be the device for you . Otherwise , I would look for something that is better quality and larger .	-1
I speak construction Spanish and wanted this to help me with more common phrases like eating lunch or talking about the weather . The first thing I noticed about this Dictionary was how extensive it was . The words and phrases that come with it are vast . I 've almost always been able to find the word or phrase I was looking for . I like the speaking function of it also . It really comes in handy if you are not able to pronounce everything you read . It has a lot of Pros going for it.The Cons : It is slow to navigate and the user interface is not intuitive . One example are the soft menu buttons at the top of the keyboard . They are suppose to be corresponding to the graphic buttons on the bottom of the screen that change functions as your navigate different functions of the device . The problem is that they do not physically line up under one another . The hard buttons are smaller and shifted to the right . You have to pause a moment to make sure you push the correct soft button . After awhile you get used to it and are faster with it , but try letting someone else use it and they will be confused.The buttons are too small . There are too many buttons and too many functions that this translator has . It should be much more simpler . If it were a study aid only then it should be laid out that way and being a little slow would n't be an issue . If it were mainly for use while actively talking to someone then it should be laid out much more simpler and be much more faster to navigate . It is simply to slow to navigate around to get to the words or phrases you are trying to speak to be of practical use . I find myself not using it more times that using it simply because I find it cumbersome.This translator is best used to study beforehand or after a conversation but not during . The games on it are only mediocre and I rarely find myself wanting to pull it out and study or speak Spanish with its help .	-1
This is not an actual Brother drum as Amazon advertises . In fact , it is a cheap imitation as far as knockoffs go . The unit arrived I installed it and the drum light still lights up meaning the printer recognizes that it is not a compatible drum . Amazon stop advertising cheap imitators as the real thing !	-1
have a TN620 & 2 TN-650 cartridge replacements from Brother via Amazon ; the TN-650 carts in brother sealed boxes look different from the 620 cartridge that came with this printer ; that cartridge doe NOT chew up the paper and cause paper jams as does the 2 TN-650 carts from Brother/Amazon.The original cartridge ( TN-620 ) stamped on the cart chassis fits snugly ; the TN-650 replacement from Brother/amazon has some play ( both of them ) and causes paper jams , although , they both show `` green '' light readiness on the control panel.Obviously , there is something very wrong with this replacement part . Ordered the cartridge that is indicated on the factory stamp pasted on the front of the printer chassis.This whole mess is starting to feel like a great conspiracy/mystery by HP ? ( bad joke ) Anyone else with the HL-5340D faced this same problem ? WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT THE DRUM UNIT IS NECESSARY FOR A CLEAR REPRODUCTION ; THEY DO N'T TELL YOU THAT ; unless you go to a cartridgle replacement center.Help !	-1
UPDATE , 12/09/13 : this machine is WAY OVERPRICED , now . I got mine for maybe $ 400 , will check and write an updated note in the comments . It was n't worth the amount I paid , much less the selling price now.UPDATE 12/09/13 : I finally gave up and reinstalled my prior MFC 9700 . It scans well . This 8480DN can not scan directly from the machine , but ONLY from the computer . However , at least the 8480DN has a power button , along with wire hookup in two ways , parallel and USB . It also allows you to configure it from the computer , without having to use that HORRIBLE LCD menu . But I got ta tell ya , I 'll never buy another Brother printer again . They did n't learn any lessons from the insanity of the MFC 9700 's frustrating interface.UPDATE 3/22/13 : I upgraded one star for the printer , because there is a way to make it do searchable pdf via its PaperPort function . But the scanner itself ca n't do that . YOU can do tht , if you have Acrobat ; its OCR function will also convert any Google doc into searchable pdf ( yay , finally I can search Shakespeare and Gibbon ) ! Of course this printer ca n't do that , but once you scan it , even without PaperPort you can take an old Adobe Acrobat 6.0 and render it searchable . I still prefer my ScanSnap S1500.I still have n't found a way to directly press the scan button ON the machine and have it scan . But printer quality is excellent . The rest of the remarks below , still stand.UPDATE 10/13/12 : the scanner does NOT produce searchable pdf . This makes the scanner nearly useless . So I downgraded the printer to 2 stars . Then downgraded it today ( 1/22/13 ) because THE SCAN BUTTON DOES N'T WORK on the machine . You can only scan remotely , from your computer . Someone in Brother quality control was very thoughtless . The machine does have some advantages ( see below ) , but I 'm giving this low rating to call attention to the UTTER THOUGHTLESSNESS of the design and the manuals.Gist : If you seek a simple fax/scan/copy/printer , look somewhere else . If you want a sophisticated version with a small footprint and are willing to accept a light duty cycle ( 30K pages per month -- meaning really no more than 500 per day ) -- keep reading . This machine has fax/scan/copy/print features I ca n't find elsewhere except in machines costing 2k or more -- cleverly created and handled . And , it 's reliable , a steady workhorse . Consumable costs are low , for what you get . When the thing gets tired after about 7 years , it still works fine , but its menu begins to say its drum needs changing , even though that 's not true.It will be easier to follow along in this review if you first download the user 's manuals on the 8480DN from Brother . Just Google on that model number and 'manual download ' , to find the page quickly . I will no longer buy any electronic product until I 've read the manual . Here , I 'm already quite familiar with this line of Brother machines . But the manuals are a nightmare , so you do need to read them and decide if it 's worth the hassle of learning . Machine itself is of great quality . Boring putty gray and charcoal color , but hey : business machines are deliberately dull ( color chosen by committee vote always means dullish gray or beige or black , yuck ) . Well , this one is n't as ugly as some . Two-toned.Even so , the Brother MFC-8480DN is MUST-BUY , if you still have DOS word processing , because it recognizes PCL 5 language , which back in DOS days was very common . I 'm so thrilled about this : all my old Multimate Advantage II merge files print as intended . ( MM II used to be the standard DOS word processing in Fortune 500 corporations , and had the easiest-to-program merge functions ever invented . ) My happy history with the elder MFC 9700 and this newer model 's PCL 5-6 emulation , were the main reasons I bought this 8480DN . Saved my bacon for all my 20+ year old client files.Yet the 8480DN can also handle modern stuff , sporting a dual TWAIN and WIA-compliant , Network-capable multifunction fax/color or b & w ; scanner/copy/print machine on a legal-size scanning plate , with PCL 5-6 ( emulating HP language as well as PostScript ) , which is compatible with Linux , Windows ( through version 7 ) , and Mac : you get three CDs ( Windows pre-7 , Windows 7 , and Mac ) for that reason . The TWAIN feature allows duplex scanning , but on the 8480DN , I 'm not sure how to make it work . Might not work at all , in XP and prior . The instructions are ambiguous , probably because the duplex problem is a WINDOWS problem , not the machine 's . Still , you can scan odd then even pages , and re-assemble in Brother 's own PaperPort or even via Adobe , to make into a duplex ( so I hear ) .This 8480DN is not automatically set up to handle wireless , but through its Ethernet port you could presumably plug it into a router . ( The 8890DW is supposedly able to do wi-fi out of the box , AND it offers easy duplex scanning ; but I did n't buy that unit . ) You can download the Linux drivers from Brother . Go to its website , search on 'Linux drivers ' , and you should get a page of them , with a bunch of model numbers . So you download , by clicking on the model . Brother is big on Linux compatibility.=============================================================Sophisticated FOUR-TIER Operation , and Installation ( Outline for this Review ) =============================================================So , this 8480DN would be a ten-star machine , except for its infuriating , fragmented , instructions : some options are scattered in the online manual , some only show in the paper manual , some only are listed on the web ; some only , in the machine 's menu . But it has a lot of features . Witness : there are FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS to run this machine , that 's why it 's so dang confusing . Ultimately you 'll find one way you want to use it , and forget the other options . But to begin with , you need to know what your options even ARE.1 . Run the machine from its own menu and buttons ON the machine . Trust me , you will soon hate doing this . But you will need to learn it , because the other ways of running the scanner , do n't include all the options which are ON the machine . Some important options , like printer emulation mode , are only available from the machine . The paper manual is correlated to these options , so is relatively easy to read.But alas , not all options you need to configure , are on the machine , so are not covered in that paper manual . So the rest of this review , will cover tips on 8480DN salient features , plus operation via Tiers # 2- # 4 , plus Maintenance.2 . Run the machine from the Brother Control Center options on your computer . Totally different organization for the many overlapping options , which basically 'tell ' the machine how to function ; neither the online nor the paper manual , correlate the same options in the Control Center . Worse , the online manual is n't organized the way the Control Center displays . Aaarrrggghh . Not all of the important options are configurable from the computer . So you have to go through BOTH manuals , but you can not program in both places at the same time ! So go through the computer options first , then the machine 's own options per the paper manual.3 . Run the scanner from the PaperPort Software . Oddly enough , this is covered in the online manual , where you do n't expect it ; also , as would be expected , from the PaperPort 's own Help menu . In my older MFC-9700 , when you scan using the machine first -- meaning , you stick the thing to be scanned in the machine and hit the scan button ON the machine -- the PaperPort menu automatically comes up on the computer . So presumably that happens with the 8480DN , too . So this will be the most common computer experience you 'll have , if you start your scans at the machine and hit its own buttons . Unfortunately , I ca n't get my 8480DN to operate by simply hitting the SCAN button ! EDIT , 10/08/12 : I still ca n't operate the scan button on the machine , must use Control Center to scan . Since I do n't find anyone else having that problem , I must assume it 's something wrong on my end , pending talking to Brother . They want me to call them , and I ca n't do that until after the 15th . One quirk in their program : you ca n't replace an existing file , even if an administrator . So if you want to rescan with the same file name , you must save to a different directory or first delete the file you originally made.4 . Run the machine 's security and permissions , from the web . Apparently this is for Networking functions by the administrator . I do n't use a network , so wo n't review this option . Its function is in the Network User 's Guide put on your computer at installation . The main functions concern who has what kind of access to the MFC 8480DN . Because , it has a lot of storage capacity ( with added memory you can easily add to the side of the machine , too ) ; so presumably access to its functions , is relegated to an administrator using the cloud . UPDATE 9/13/12 -- the manager of a large apartment complex with units all over the place told me her 8890DW was completely and swiftly installed REMOTELY by some geek in another state . He did it all by commands directly to the machine . No CD required . So apparently network installation can be heavenly.The rest of this review now focuses on Tier # 2 and # 3 usage . These are the most useful and difficult tiers of configuration features , to understand . There are over 1000 configurable features . Sadly , Brother 's explanations while good , are VERY disorganized . You will spend HOURS in the pdf manuals , as a ) they have no page numbers , and b ) their own search engine is dysfunctional ( not Adobe 's search engine , but their own . Why ? ) NOTE TO BROTHER : Organize the pdf according to the Control Center software screens , to lower confused customer calls ? Dovetail the at-machine paper manual with the pdf User 's manual , so the user can IDENTIFY common functions , versus functions only ON the machine , or only choosable FROM the computer ? You have a good product , Brother -- but oh brother , the convoluted manuals make us tear our hair out ! INSTALLATION TIPS : 1 ) install the software first . 2 ) DO NOT hook up the USB or Parallel interface to the MFC until told to do so ; 3 ) leave the MFC OFF until told to turn it on . 4 ) DO NOT select 'Custom ' installation : it sends the installer into a hang , for Brother wants to advertise using its own toner brand ; the installer wo n't complete , else . So , you must install three times ( without uninstalling ) : a ) install first WITHOUT Paperport , then b ) install again WITH Paperport , then c ) do it a third time , to install the only option left , Brother 's PostScript driver . Took me four hours to figure out that a ) b ) c ) .After installation , there are HUNDREDS of setup options to analyze : 20 customized presets ( maybe more ) . You can also change options ad hoc , right on the machine , though its now-larger LCD menu remains as annoying as ever . At least now it 's backlit and readable . Whew.Oh : the 8480DN forgets the time , even if unplugged for a moment . To reset it , call up Brother 's Control Center menu and use its Remote Setup , Device Settings , Initial Setup : then check the box next to 'PC Clock ' . DO NOT reset the time ON the machine : your PC clock then ca n't reset it , unless you reboot . Sigh . Okay , but that 's all the bad news : dysfunctional pdf manuals , and a hypersensitive ticker . Not too bad.Else , this multifunction machine is a huge improvement over its hard-working predecessor , the MFC 9700 , which I 've owned since about 2005 . So let 's see why.=============================================================What can this 8480DN really do ? LOTS . To wit : =============================================================** SCAN or print directly to PDF ( and other formats ) , either via your computer , or by itself , with a handy USB port right in front of the machine ; just stick in a pen drive and convert your files on it . ( I have to test this more , to see how it works . ) You can preset 16 sets of options , but only via the computer . Quality scanning is very slow . If you want fast , readable but not superlative scans , accept the defaults of 400 or 200 pixels . File sizes are also smaller . A quality scan will take maybe 20 minutes . Frankly I do n't see much difference between the umpteen bizillion pixels Brother can do , versus the small file standard , but maybe there is a huge difference in photos . Scanning options are many , creative , and sophisticated . For example , say you wanted to make a banner . So you print out sections of this 'banner ' and now want to 'assemble ' it in a scan as one big piece . You can do that . Or , conversely , scan to fit as many as 25 pages onto one legal or even smaller page . You can do that . You can duplex scan , but in two steps , not one ; and you have to use PaperPort ( covered below ) , if you 're on XP . ** Duplex or simplex PRINTING in black and white , but color for scanning , selectable to very high resolution levels . Legal size glass , so you can fit more on the scanner . You can also size the output to shrink up to four pages onto one page . Via a special option in Direct Print -- where you plug a pen drive into the front of the machine and print what 's on the drive , bypassing the computer -- you can shrink as many as 25 pages onto only one page . The printing options here are enormous and sophisticated , seen on many high-end machines ( i.e. , make books or pamphlets ) . The machine is silent except when printing . When printing , the chief sound is the fan , windlike ; not harsh . You can hear the paper revv up , too . Warmup is n't fast , but is acceptable . 32ppm is about right . It 's fast enough for a small office . It 's aggressive about conserving energy , hence the slower warmup . ** ADF of 50 pages , I think . It looks improved , versus my older machine . This newer model has a fabulous paper path to make it easier to remove jams . ** You get many REMOTE PROGRAMMING options set from either the computer or directly on the machine , versus earlier Brother models . You can operate the machine remotely , too ; call into it and 'poll ' ( receive its stored input ) . ** You can FAX receive/send either directly from your computer , including broadcasting to groups , timed faxes , polling ( get faxes from some distant machine , like IRS fax downloads ) . The Brother offers many different resolutions and settings you can choose for printed fax clarity ; by contrast , its internal PC-Fax function ( faxing directly from your computer ) is weirdly capped to 200x200 resolution . ** You can SCAN to create files on your computer , of course . Paperport manipulates the scanned pages afterwards ( i.e. , change page order , formats ) . The 8480DN uses Paperport version 11 . ** COPYing , including with almost-too-many settings for 'cleaning ' an original , reduction , enlargement , shrinking up to 4 pages into one page . Many options in the dialogue boxes to help correct bad originals ; the manuals offer good hints , too . Copy and print settings you change on the fly ( i.e. , lower row of charcoal square buttons ) do n't change your defaults ; they only change your next function . ** NETWORK-capable , has its own Ethernet port . Hook it up using either parallel or USB . ( I prefer parallel ; keeps my USB ports free and less drain on the machine . ) Lots of security options ; mind-boggling , how you can configure pinpointed security . ** SIMULTANEITY , true MULTIFUNCTION : you can send/receive a fax , print , and scan to file all at the SAME time . No special setting for this , it 's automatic . I 've been in the middle of a scan when a fax came in ; or , was printing , on my older 9700 . Or had left something scanned on the plate but scanned something else , with no mixup . I still do n't know why it works so well . So that convenience continues in the newer 8480DN . ** Need more MEMORY ? Simple : buy and insert the added RAMM into the side of the machine as easily as you 'd insert an SSD card into a slot of your netbook . Default memory claims to support storage of 600 pages of scans ( presumably text , not necessarily that high for photos ) .================================================Now to Tier # 2 , at this review 's start : running the 8480 DN from the CONTROL CENTER.================================================After installation , you access Control Center 3 via subset of the MFC-8480 menu under 'Brother ' menu/folder . Ignore its option to use the 'Modern ' skin , stick instead to the turquoise default menu . Pick Device Settings , then Remote Setup . There will be a pause , as the computer loads the settings resident in the machine . These are fairly straight forward , except for some arcanely-named options , covered below . As you work with them , remember to periodically hit the 'Apply ' button , to save your work to the MFC while editing . Click the OK button to save and exit . The Remote Setup Dialogue box 's 'tree ' headers are : GENERAL : the oddly-named 'Mode Timer ' means the RESET time between the last function you did , and resumption of Fax Mode . If you turn 'Mode Timer ' off , you disable faxing . At times that 's helpful , to avoid interruptions ; generally you 'd want the default of 2 minutes . The setting also controls how long you can repeat whatever you last did , too . So if you 've a longish copy or print job , increase the Mode Timer or turn it 'off ' to disable any reset to Fax Mode. -- - Paper Type and Tray # 1 ( .5 ream ) and MP Tray . The former is the pull-out tray . The other is a bypass tray , which they call 'MP ' ; its door is drop-down : light-gray door on the front of the machine ( not the dark gray part for the drum and toner ) : see the paper manual 's page 12 . So you can feed 1-3 sheets or envelopes at a time , via the bypass . This becomes useful for mixed paper types in a print job , when you code the machine to pause at certain points . You can also buy another .5 ream pullout tray to attach underneath the machine , for about $ 200 more . ( The tray integrates into the machine via screws supplied with the unit . ) -- - Default Paper Type is Plain ( think 'copy paper ' of Xerox quality , approx . 18-lb ) ; but the 8480DN also accepts thin or thick paper . The manuals give you great hints on how to tell what 's thin or thick by paper behavior -- including envelopes , the # 1 complaint users have about this machine -- so you waste less paper guessing . Envelopes are problemmatic in any laser printer ; the cheaper ones are usually the worst . The thinner , the worse . As for thick , 65-lb paper qualifies as 'thick ' ( stiff stock for title pages in presentation folders ) . Even 65-lb paper worked fine in my MFC 9700. -- - Tray Use means where should the machine SEARCH for the paper to print . Default is the bypass 'MP ' tray first , then the pullout ( 'T1 ' ) tray . Be sure to match the machine 's settings to the size paper you use . You have many sizes to choose , all the way up to legal. -- - Glass Scan Size limits how far the scanner will scan on the plate . So you match that to your actual paper size , as well , lest you get black/blank scan. -- - File Size refers to compression if you 're printing to a file : use 'small ' if you 'll email . Else , use the default for either Color or Grayscale , to file . ( Acrobat will give you the smallest file size . Next best is Fujitsu S1500 scanner . This Brother might be as good . ) FAX : Setup Receive 's Ring Delay should probably be set to 2 , so the fax will pick up on the third ring . The Fax/Tele Ring Time of 30 seconds is usually best , as that 's the usual 'handshaking ' time between calling and answering faxes , especially if you attached an answering machine ( aka 'TAD ' ) . Do n't use voicemail , because Ameritech or Comcast or will take the call , so your fax ca n't 'hear ' it . Attach an old-fashioned answering machine from 1990 or later. -- - Setup Send is a little more arcane : here you can set Batch or Real Time transmission off or on , whether a cover page and what kind , with preset or customized messages . ( Frankly , it 's easier to create your own cover page , unless you broadcast to many people . ) See pages 45-46 of the paper manual , for details. -- - Address Book ! Yowsa : you can type in the numbers and names ( they make Vcards ) , or you can import Outlook or Outlook Express 6 data to the MFC -- but not from HERE ! Oh no , they put the Address Book import option in Control Center 3 's PC-Fax , 'Setup ' option . Then , select the 'AddressBook ' tab and specify type and file path for your book. -- - Report Setting gives you a valuable history log of faxes in and out . I set mine up to give me a weekly report , but you can select it by day , hour , or x # of faxes . The 'Start At ' means what hour , for time . It might mean something else , if you pick a different option. -- - Remote Fax Options : these control how you want your fax to act , when you 're away . You can have it forward , be paged , have it store in the machine ( so you can retrieve it remotely , which Brother calls 'polling ' ) ; or , have it store in your computer. -- - Dial Restrictions is a kind of quick password protection , to prevent others or yourself from dialing wrongly.COPY : You 'd adjust these settings for higher than normal resolution . Increase Contrast if copying pencil ; increase brightness if the original is old or discolored . The manuals here offer helpful hints on how to clean up your originals ( esp . what Brother calls 'noise ' ) . So too , the dialogue boxes ; play with the settings . Very nice and rare features.PRINT : to duplex or not duplex , that is the longevity question . In the 'Automatic duplex Printing ' section of the onscreen User 's Guide -- it says 'DO NOT use bond paper ' for duplex , with good reason . I 'd argue never to use duplex at all , unless you want to shorten the life of your machine , and spend extra money at least once a year to have some professional clean your machine 's innards.===== > GRATUITOUS TREEHUGGING MESSAGE : If you want to save a tree , go paperless . If you want to see your printed paper become brittle faster , go duplex . Its value is way overrated . Great for book printing , but again you 'll just dirty your machine twice as fast , i.e. , 100 pages duplexed 50 , will dirty twice as fast as 100 pages simplex , for the toner goes on BOTH sides of the rollers . It 's a false economy , and you can always reuse paper on only one side , for scrap ... DIRECT PRINT : makes the MFC print directly from your pen drive or plugged-in camera , without the computer . Here , you can shrink up to 25 pages onto one , in multiple formats . Could be useful if the computer is off or tied up.SCAN to USB : means you can scan directly to a pen drive , too , bypassing the computer.NETWORK options are fairly straightforward . Remember that UTC is almost equal to GMC , for the time zone.INITIAL SETUP : Check the 'PC Clock ' box . Quirk in the machine will keep on unchecking that box , after you save . That 's probably why when you turn off the machine , it forgets the time . But hey : my beloved MFC 9700 did n't even have a power button . The machines are meant to stay on , ever vigilant for faxes.Here you must experiment , with 'Dial Tone ' . Sometimes setting it to Detection creates glitches ; sometimes not . The 'Dial Prefix ' should be '1 ' ( just as for your Fax and Tel numbers ) , if your stored phone numbers do n't have that prefix , or you otherwise have a direct line out . If you have to dial some prefix to get an outside line , put that in front . Since the 8480DN is hooked up to the PC , check 'from PC Clock ' for the source of the machine 's time , especially if you often have power outages . Finally , if you set the machine to 'manual ' fax receipt , then you must type a code , to activate the fax . You set the code in the Setup Receive option under FAX.Whew ! You 're 10 % done ! Now let 's talk about the other turquoise ControlCenter3 entries above 'Device Settings ' . These , too , do n't operate as you 'd expect.SCAN : if you left-click , you tell Brother to scan something IMMEDIATELY on the scanning glass , for any of the four items listed . They are DESTINATIONS for your scanning , so you must program them first . So you RIGHT click , to configure settings . Next , you 'll see a tabbed dialogue box . Its 'Software Button ' is a preset you configure for scanning directly into an application , but USING YOUR COMPUTER . By contrast , the 'Device Button ' is a preset for the SCAN BUTTON on the 8480DN . So , you have one 'pair ' per Image , OCR , Email and File . Thus you can have up to eight presets . If that much flexibility makes your head spin , set both Software and Device button options exactly alike , so you can use the computer OR the button on the machine , to get the same result . Repeat : the buttons are DESTINATION-oriented , so you have up to eight destinations , two per type of scan , you can choose . And you choose , the application DESTINATION for the scan ; the File Type , resolution and scan type , paper size . Also , click 'Scanner Interface ' if you plan to crop the image after scanning , or otherwise edit it . If an application you want to use is n't in the drop-down list and you know the path of the application you want to use , then click the 'Add ' button and then click on the folder icon , to browse for that program 's location . Suggest you add MSPScan.exe which is Microsoft 's own Document scanning program . Sometimes it 's faster ; and like Paperport , offers post-scan file manipulation.===== > SUGGESTION : pick the highest resolution and quality settings for IMAGE and OCR and FILE ; but for EMAIL pick the lowest settings you can stomach . For your average email ISP services like AOL , Verizon , etc . allow only 5MB for attachments . So too , the IRS and other Government agencies provide their employees with very limited storage , capping email attachments to about 5MB per email . ( Note : gmail and Yahoo have much higher caps , like 20-30MB per email . ) CUSTOM SCAN : this is the same as scan , except that you get to change the icon names , too . Another 8 configuration options , for Software and Device Buttons.Whew ! Now you 're 50 % done ! Could they make it more complicated ? COPY : Here you get four added presets for Copying , when you right-click . You can even specify different printers , whether to scale ( fit ) the text to the size of the output page , and other options . Since it 's usually easier to change common copy settings on the machine , these four are best reserved for very special jobs , with maybe 60 suboptions . Give the presets names which will make you instantly remember what they do.PC-FAX : Max resolution is 400x 400 , in this model ; but if you plan to do delayed or batch/broadcasted ( to many people ) faxes , PC-Fax can be helpful ( see pages 45-46 of the paper manual ) . Again , you right click the Send icon to configure it to send faxes directly from your computer , rather than print out and then feed the machine . Presumably the Send icon setting controls Receive , too , as you ca n't configure that one 's resolution from the computer ; you CAN configure it from the machine , see the paper manual on Setup Receive.Back to the Control Center configuration : If you make a mistake and hit its Receive icon more than once , you get the PaperPort menu , so have to quit and REBOOT , to reset the icon . So instead , hit the Setup icon . Finally , here you get a sensible dialogue box . The 'Address Book ' tab is most helpful : you can load your Outlook or Outlook Express addresses and phones into the Brother . Suggest you first complete your Outlook/Express data before you import . Finally , the Speed Dial tab allows you to configure a special 10 speed dial from your computer . These will not be the same as what you programmed back in the Device Settings , Remote Fax Setup 'Address Book ' . Presumably those latter , match the speed-dial numbers on the machine , up to 34 . ( By the way , when you use Speed Dial , the too-white menu on the machine will light up with the name associated with that speed dial number , so you get to SEE the speed dial name , before sending . ) Back in the 'Speed Dial ' tab of PC-Fax Setup : to configure the special 10 , you must manually 'add ' the name on the left , to a number on the right . Again , you can only dial these from your PC.Whew , 70 % done ! Are you groaning , yet ? ================================Now to Tier # 3 , using Paperport to run your 8480DN.=================================Paperport is a scanner controller plus sorter and converter ; it works like moving papers on your desk , into finished bundles . Paperport has distinct scanner control advantages versus direct machine or Control Center . You access Paperport from the ScanSoft Paper Port menu item ( or programs ) . Most importantly , it can make duplex scans . Here 's how : access Paperport , select duplex , and you 'll get a cute dialogue box telling you how to do it . Additionally , you can specify whether you want to scan in TWAIN or WIA mode , an option not selectible ( so far as I can tell ) , via Tier # 1 direct on-machine or # 2 Control Center operating modes . It might not work in XP , or maybe it only works with Twain . I 've not yet tested it , just going by its instructions , en ce moment . Will report back here with the results.Again , Paperport is fairly basic , intuitive . It has has many fans , and three chief advantages : a ) it 's organized like a desktop , so you can arrange stuff on it , move that stuff around into stacks or unstack ; just like shuffling papers into or out of stacks , on your desk . So , scan of 50 unrelated pages ; and then move each of those pages into other stacks , be they photos , charts , whatever . Then b ) you can scan while in Paperport , to add more stuff to reassemble . Then c ) you can export your stacks into a variety of applications which are iconized at the bottom of the screen : like Outlook Express , Excel , Word , pdf , etc . Paperport is Win7 compatible , so will show compatible apps . You get these same features with Fujitsu Scan Snap S1500 , Adobe Acrobat , and many Acrobat knock offs , my favorite being Smart PDF Creator Pro . They all work better at arranging and converting , vs. MS or WordPerfect Office.Limited tagging and editing , in Paperport . I could n't see any options , but I 'm sure there are some.==================================MAINTENANCE==================================This machine requires very little upkeep . A bit of Windex on the plate once a week or month , depending on how often you scan ; feather-dust everything else , especially the interiors , once a month or more often ; I actually use a turkey feather bought in a craft shop ( you know , for kids wanting to play Indian chief at Halloween ) . I use it also to clean between my keyboard crevices . Handy thing.RUN CLEANER SHEETS after a major print job which is dense ( 200+ pages ) , else once a week ( you can buy these in Amazon ) . You can use each of these sheets five or ten times and still get cleaning from them . They are impregnated with a substance which catches toner and DUST . Those are the two killers of good output , and if you do n't do it , you ask for trouble . Think of it as the equivalent of not defragging your hard drive . If you do n't defrag once a week , your machine will slow to a crawl . The sheets prevent that BLACK LINE you so often see in unkempt faxes . Toner is a kind of dust ; it 's so fine , that by the time you see little black spots , it 's almost too late . GET THE CLEANING SHEETS . Any printer needs this.I like those lint-free old flour towels our mothers used to have , for cleaning the plate . Got any old makeup brushes ? Clean them and use them to dust inside the ADF , especially the rollers . DO NOT use solvent on the rollers , unless you like a dysfunctional machine . At most , use a dampened sheet which has no lint ( better still , just a soft blush brush which is VERY clean ) . Dirty ADFs are a major cause of jams . Takes a few minutes while on a phone call or watching something on TV . Once a week.CONSUMABLES : I think the Brother toner runs about $ 70 , and it lasts a long time . They say 3,000 pages , but I 've gotten a lot more than that . I still keep the old toners , in case I suddenly need one . Shake it from side to side maybe once a month or two , to make it last longer . The toner problem is n't so much that it runs out , but that it sticks to the sides . When the print quality looks bad , the toner cartridge needs a little rocking from side to side . Do it over the sink , unless you have black carpets.The drum unit is maybe $ 100-120 , and it too has a much longer life than Brother recommends . Though , they tell you to ignore the CHANGE DRUM SOON warning until you see degradation you ca n't tolerate . My old MFC 9700 h	-1
To start off with , I think that these are just generic labels . And each `` seller '' selling them has different labels . I say this because one reviewer said that the labels were glossy ( shiny was the word they used ) and mine were matte . So I think what you get wo n't necessarily be what I got.The reason this product got two stars is because the print did n't smear and they stuck to an envelope.The bad news is:1 ) The labels do not peel up easily and you will spend significantly more time with them than you would with the Avery brand.2 ) There is no printing front or back , and because of the way the die print shows on both sides , I occasionally put one in upside down and print on the back.3 ) The die cut of the labels is very imperfect , and often a label will peel up a stretch of border . Or the label will have to be torn off and leave a tag or rough spot.For Christmas cards , none of these problems really mattered . But if I had to use these labels often I would be returning them . They are junk.To be honest , you get what you pay for . If you buy these expect them to be imperfect . But if you only want to spend about $ 10 on your labels , and you do n't care about any little irritations , then I guess they are ok .	-1
I used this product on my Epson Artisan printer . The label sheets jammed often and also curled up so I had little tough time.I loaded sheet 1 after 1 when I print because I used this product for my customers and I can not screw it.The price is great and the product should be good too but I do n't think I will purchase this again .	-1
I have tried these labels with digital templates for Avery 5160 from Avery , and several other sources . The first few rows print correctly but the rest are all aligned wrong . I had to buy new labels from a local office supply store .	-1
==========Comment just for the Seller : Labels are formulated for laser in at least two important ways . First , the adhesive has a higher temperature capacity , so it does n't melt inside the printer or copier . ( Inkjet just sprays on the ink - does not heat up the paper surface at all ) .Second , the surface area is specifically formulated to hold toner.You KNOW that these labels are not formulated for laser ... so why would you market them that way ? ? ? If you had disclosed they are for inkjet only , I would give them 3 stars for being a decent generic/Avery knock-off.But they are falsely advertised as laser safe . You get zero stars . You say the product is 100 % guaranteed - are you going to pay our $ 180 repair bill on our laser printer ? We 'll see.==========Now onto the review ... Oh boy , these labels are a trip . We 've ordered twice , got a different product both times . Never ordering again anything that says `` Americopy '' again.The first time , the finish was more like a thermal label , somewhat glossy . I thought the finish looked nice & professional . They worked fine in inkjet , not so well in laser , but no major problems . A decent generic item.However , the second time , the finish looked just like a normal piece of paper ( like 20 # bond copy paper ) . Almost as if they just sprayed adhesive on the back of it.When you put the two next to each other , they do n't even look manufactured by the same person . Very odd . The 1st style we used up in our inkjet printers , and worked fine . The 2nd type we used in our laser , and they are NOT working.In our first laser printer , the toner just flaked right off . So we tried in our expensive laser printer ( the first batch worked ok , not great , so we thought we 'd give it a try ) .The sheet LITERALLY melted and jammed up the entire works . We worked for hours to pull all the little stickers out of there . Ended up costing $ 180 repair bill.Lowest score possible for the deceptive advertising .	-1
Oh , I hate to disagree with people . I think sometimes we complain about trivial things . But ... I wanted a mechanical pencil that was easy to use . I had another one that all you had to do was click a strip on the side or front ( depending on how you hold the pencil ) and eraser located where every other pencil has the eraser.. This one , you have to click the top , but the eraser is also on top . So you have to remove the cover to erase . The cover is also the thing you click to advance the lead . I ended up with about 1/4 inch of lead sticking out because I would click it when trying to remove it to use the eraser . I tried to write with the longer lead because I did n't want to waste the lead . Not easy . Went back to the other ones . They come in a two pack & # 34 ; Paper Mate Clear Tip 0.7mm Mechanical Pencil & # 34 ; is the one I recommend	-1
I would pass on this . It 's very heavy . Also , when you attach a pen on the side , the weight of the pen makes your I.D . tilt to the side . Further the fabric material which its made of is not very attractive , not at all like the photo . I would totally pass on this .	-1
Stroppy works about as well as a ball bearing as a door stop ! It does not work on finished concrete , carpeted floors or linoleum floors . Tried on four different doors on these surfaces of various gap heights and the stroppy would not hold door to even a mild nudge much less moderate pressure.Save your money , this product is a true `` New Age , Yuppie Nice Looking '' piece of junk . A simple wedge type door stop worked well on each of the doors that the Stroppy failed on .

While working at the Fabio fan club , I operated 20 of these for all the hate mail the office received . The Shredder is not that good if you are dealing in high volume , thick paper . Most of the time it was jammed up . The parts are not durable . Another problem I have is that it does n't Shred bread or old food very well . Pizza crust gets caught in the metal teeth very easily .	-1

UPDATE : 10/27/2011As you can see below by my initial review , we really liked this shredder . But as other reviewers have stated , it breaks in just months of use . If it 's under the one-year warranty then you 're fine , Fellowes will send you a new one . But for us it was 1 year , 4 months when it failed . Being out of warranty , I opened the case to take a look , and the mechanism is pretty simple : very sharp blades , a POWERFUL motor , and an incredibly cheap plastic rod with the little lever on the end that gets moved when you put paper through , which in turn starts the shredding . I ca n't believe how cheap this plastic rod/lever is , no WONDER these shredders FAIL after a short life . It 's just plain bad design . What a shame , the motor & blades look like they could shred a Weber grill.I called Fellowes Customer Service and immediately got an extremely nice rep on the phone . She tried all ways to help me out ( I just wanted a new plastic lever , I 'd install it myself ) . Unfortunately their hands are tied , the only part they have available tp sell is a replacement bottom basket . Weird . The only option she was allowed to offer was for me to buy a refurbished unit at a lower cost on their online store , she even apologized that there was nothing else she could do.I called a local Business machine dealer who is an authorized Fellowes repair and even he said that for Fellowes consumer shredders he ca n't get parts , bugs him too . The only option is toss it away , to repair it ( even IF parts were available ) would be more than the cost of the shredder.So , this shredder has two excellent parts , blades and motor , but the switch is so poorly and cheaply made , it kills the value . If you have one PLEASE put your paper in GENTLY.Needless to say , I will buy a new shredder , and it will never ever be a Fellowes brand because of the bad policy of not making replacement parts available . What a shame , this could have been a great shredder.====================================================================Original Review : We 've been using this shredder for almost 3 months and it 's been a champ so far . I oil it ( one quick squirt along the cutter ) every 3 or 4 weeks , and so far so good ( and please , buy the oil ! ) . I almost deducted a star because it does n't cut CDs or DVDs ( I bet it would , this thing is pretty strong ) , but then I realized that 's ridiculous , it 's not a model designed for that . So it 's a 5-star shredder to us.It has one other great attribute : for some reason , it does n't scare our cat when we shred something ( the same cat that eats through the roof when the vacuum cleaner gets turned on ) , so when he sleeps on his pad near us in our home office , we can shred away and not bug him . That 's amazing , because this is NOT a quiet shredder . Quiet shredders are in big cases and cost way more than this .	-1
This shredder is pretty good for the price but , if you are willing to spend more , you can completely alleviate any and all of the negatives with this shredder which are : -It 's quite loud which is annoying in an office environment or even in a home.-It bogs down and can jam if you feed it more than about 7 pages and it can be a hassle to have to worry about counting out less pages to feed it.-The top part ( motor ) is quite heavy , making it a pain to have to lift in order to empty the bin , which you will have to do very often . This does have a built in handle which is nice but it 's still a hassle and you have to then put the motor ( which is often quite dusty and littered with paper shreds ) on the carpet/floor . As someone who appreciates good design , a shredder with a lift-motor atop a bin is not that.-It does n't shred CDs/DVDs-Research shows this model tends to break such that it would only run in reverse.In comparison , theFellowes Powershred 100 % Jam Proof 79Ci 14 Sheet Cross-Cut Paper Shredder ( 3227901 ) solves all of the above negatives and is so much of a better shredder . The only thing is , it 's a lot more expensive but I think it 's worth it . Using the two side by side , the W-11C you sort of dred using while the 79CI is a joy to use .	-1
It 's innovative . Pencil lead will come out automatically as you write . However , the grip is terrible . Occasional usage is fine , but it 's not very good if you used it for a prolong period of time.I will recommend this insteadhttp : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AQOA0/ref=as_li_tl ? ie=UTF8 & camp ; =1789 & creative ; =390957 & creativeASIN ; =B0000AQOA0 & linkCode ; =as2 & tag ; =travguid0ca-20	-1
I bought this as soon as I heard of it since I love pencils . The rotation makes an attractive even line , but at the cost of an uncomfortable point in my opinion.I might be in the minority but I like the larger group surface area of a stationary tip , even at the cost of line variance in writing .	-1
I wish I could say something nice about this pencil but I 'd be lying if I did . It uses very thin pieces of what I gather is lead ; it could stab someone right to the heart . The pencil does a fine job of scratching and tearing paper when you would like to write something with it . It is totally undependable and , occasionally , for reasons I 've not fathomed , writes well . Go figure.Get an old yellow # 2 with the eraser on top , put the other end into a pencil-sharpener and then write . Better yet , use a ballpoint . Who bothers to write with a pencil today anyway ?	-1
It 's not a bad printer but it is inefficient with respect to ink usage . I use it a lot for scanning and copying and it has helped me immensely ; it looks pretty good too.It gets one star because it literally gobbles up all the ink . Sometimes I even wonder if somebody is using it while I am not at home . I thought I got this for a good deal back in 2009 until I realized that they got their money back many times over through ink sales . I only print in text mode and it still sucks up all the ink . I do n't even print pictures or anything like that.The scanning and copying capability are actually very useful and the Wi-Fi works flawlessly.I can also verify that the machine literally shuts down if you have only one empty cartridge . Even if your black cartridge is full , if a color cartridge is out , the printer stops functioning till you refill it . It 's like Epson is holding the printer hostage till you buy their ink.The printer is also a little noisy compared to some others that I have heard even in quiet mode . It makes a very high pitched sound when printing . My old HP from 1998 was fairly quiet . The carbon fiber look on the top is nice and the small display looks good as well . It has a card reader as well which is useful but redundant in this day and age.I 'd like to really give it a better rating because it has some useful features but the ink issue is just unacceptable . Due to cost concerns , in the near future I will probably have to upgrade this to another model or perhaps a laser printer.EDIT November 20 , 2012 : I purchased a Brother laser printer and a Brother all-in-one inkjet and I packed this Epson printer up and put it in the basement .	-1
Pros : Low price of printerPros : Good quality print ... while it worksCons : Makes infernal racket when not operating in `` quiet '' modeCeased working properly after only 4 monthsEpson would not honor warrantyEpson customer service is totally unsatisfactoryEpson ink carrtidges are outrageously-priced ... one set of 4 cartridges could exceed original purchase price of printer.Other Thoughts : After about 2 months , I had replaced all the original OEM ink cartridges with Epson-compatible ones . There was no difference in print quality or printer operations using the non-Epson ink ... until a few days ago . When the black cartridge started producing spotty print , I thought .. ah , time for head cleaning ! Yeah , right . After running 8 consecutive nozzle checks and exhausting 2 full magenta and yellow ink cartridges in the process , I still did not get any print pattern from the black , magenta , and yellow cartridges , all of which I replaced again . I then started e-mailing Epson tech support , and got nothing but the proverbial run-around . I called the number provided for warranty service . After better than 30 minutes ( including wait time and holds ) on a toll line , I was told that nothing could be done under the warranty because I was using non-Epson ink . That `` verdict '' was subsequently amended to state that I first had to buy a full set of 4 Epson ink cartridges ( ~ $ 53.70 ) ! STAY AWAY , AS WILL I !	-1
I tried two of these printers . They print well , they scan well , they are fast , they set up easily , the scanner software is amazing , but THEY ARE INK SPONGES . Both printers used up half their ink on 10 5x7 highest quality photos and 15 copies of a MS Word letter . The printer wastes a LOT of ink when it starts up from sleep mode , and even uses ink when all you want to do is scan . I took both of them back to Best Buy .	-1
JUNK , JUNK , JUNK , JUNK ! ! ! Everything bad written in all the 1 star reviews is TRUE.I have printed less than 500 pages on this 2-3 year old printer and it is toast . I do n't even want to know what my cost per page is , I 'm upset enough.Worse than the printer 's poor quality is that of EPSON service . If your printer is out of warranty and the print heads can not be self-cleaned EPSON will tell you to buy a complete set of new cartridges ( more than the cost of many new printers ! ) first and , if that does n't clear the problem , will tell you you should take it to one of their authorized reapir centers , all on your dime.However , they are kind enough to inform you that repair costs will probably exceed the cost of a new printer . As a `` consolation '' EPSON might allow you access to a webpage on their site that allows you , as a `` valued customer '' to buy a new unit at a discount . Big deal . Their discounted prices are more than almost any other retailer , by far.The e-mail service rep could n't even spell my name right although it was sent to him correctly . What corporate stupidity.In charity I am going to write to John Lang the President of Epson America to tell him that his company is going to go the way of the buggy whip if they do n't change.Unless EPSON can completely turn this customer 's experience around I will NEVER buy or recommend another EPSON product.My advice in general is that unless you print alot of photos do n't spend a lot of money on a printer . I am also considering a printer that has the print heads built into the cartridges themselves as a jam is then fixed by simply replacing the cartridge . Also will look for a printer that users indicate runs well on remanufactured cartridges . No more EPSON ink scam.All that being said ... .hasta la vista EPSON .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS YOU 'LL REGRET IT ... Epson Co is a scam , get an HP , or a Cannon instead I am . You 've heard of alcoholic this is an INKOHOLIC guzzling down more ink then a dying of thirst human does water . Bought this from Amazon in 2010 I was overjoyed it worked like a dream up until Sep 2013.this is what happened ( 1 ) After a recent Epson software update neither this or my old Epson Workforce 500 will print , after putting in new cartridges a sign pops up out of ink buy Epson genuine ink , with a link to their site with tax it 's over $ 80 for 4 tiny cartridges in office supply stores which I refuse to pay . I buy all my ink here have been for years and the epson compatible cartridges always worked before . I feel like my printers are being held hostage because I wo n't buy insanely expensive Epson ink ( 2 ) Kick in the backside I had just cleaned the print heads put in all new cartridges let it sit , I was on Yahoo web surfing though I did n't click print on the printer or through the computer demon printer go 's nuts printing over 30 pages in color conveniently stopping only after the ink was gone . tried stopping it no dice then turning it off every way there is failed , even after unplugging it the second it was plugged in again it resumed printing until the cartridges registered empty ( 3 ) This month I cleaned the heads manually bringing it back to factory condition looks like new , stupid me hoped it 'd print because it always worked in the past nope , now all they 'll do is scan letting you save images on your computer nothing else ( 4 ) I tried uninstalling All the Epson software from my computer , and even went so far as to go into data files removing any left over bits of ndata there were that usually works . You know how when you reinstall the software the program pops up asking you to click to start the instillation nothing it took searching 3 times to find it and I had to use windows media player to open it after a brief struggle it finally reinstalled even this did not do any good ( 5 ) And this is something new I noticed that had never happened before it started early this year the printer heads were conveniently constantly clogging up , picture a seriously stopped up drain and you 've got itI 've never done this before but out of indigination did today , some of you may have already seen a 2010 rave review I left prior to this one I deleted it . More than anything I want to save others from the dissappointment hell and frustration I and countless others went through . I learned quickly Epson does not even sell refillable ink cartridges for their own printers . Cannon on the other hand does they also have Cannon compatible ink cartridges here as well . I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING EPSON AGAIN	-1
This thing is a piece of junk . I bought this and another Epson just like it ( except without WiFi ) . Both lasted less than 6 months ( the paper carrier quit working on this one ; the the thing that travels back and forth to print , broke on my other one . ) Also , the ink tanks holds little ink . You will go broke keeping this thing in ink.The WiFi also was poor at connecting to other computers.Since I owned two of these and neither lasted 6 months , this thing gets a 1 rating . I would give it a zero , but that was n't available.This is sad really , as the first Epson printer I ever bought lasted over 10 years . That is why I bought the Epson brand again . But , apparently , Epson now just makes junk . I will never buy another Epson .	-1
Have it for 2 months rarely use it and it broke . Document wont feed , error messages of low ink stay on . Make matters worse cant even exchange this piece of plastic junk . By the way beware of Hp policies . They will sell you replacement parts ofcourse and tell you its good for 1 year . But as I have found out that 's not true . part does n't last a year and they charge you for replacement . Never buying Hp again . Hello Dell .	-1
There is a good reason why this fax machine costs $ 65 . You will be lucky if you can receive 100 pages before the tiny black cartridge runs out . Even on Amazon this cartridge will run you $ 40 . That 's $ 0.40 per page . This is on top of the fact that it does not give ANY indication that it is running low on ink . I went to lunch one day and five pages had been faxed , the last two were blank , and there was no indication on the screen.This fax also allows misguided spam calls to ring constantly until it finally realizes that it is junk and makes an even louder beeping noise . When printing pages it sounds like my old ink jet from the 90 's and it does n't print fast either , one page can take up to two minutes . I seriously had to move this thing into another room the sound was so annoying.I have since brought my wireless Lexmark all in one printer from home and it works a hela'va lot better ( quieter ) and gets 500 pages for five bucks .	-1
I purchased a pack of these at an office supply chain . Worked great for a day -- THEN RAN OUT OF INK ! ! Absurd . I went through the whole pack in less than a week , when one highlighter usually lasts me a month ! BAD VALUE	-1
I got this because I heard how amazing Frixion pens , highlighter were from my friends . First of all you need to wait till it dries before erasing it which was n't the problem . The problem was the big wet mark in my paper after it 's erased with the pink tinge . I 'm not impressed .	-1
This is only 25 yards ( 900 inches ) per roll compared to the standard 54.6 yards for the rolls with the bigger cores that fit your standard tape dispenser . The Scotch brand tape I 've bought on Amazon just did n't have much stickiness . I do n't know if it 's just old , for tape has a certain shelf life , or if it 's possibly counterfeit like so many other things on Amazon . I have use Scotch brand tape in the past that was really good tape , but something is going on .	-1
There is a reason there are more 1 star ratings for this printer than there are 4 and 5 star rating combined ( at least when I did this rating ) .IT IS BECAUSE THIS PRINTER IS A PIECE OF JUNK.I bought this and another Epson just like it ( except the other had WiFi -- -Epson NX515 ) . Both lasted less than 6 months ( the paper carrier quit working on the other one ; the thing that travels back and forth to print , broke on this one . ) Also , the ink tanks holds little ink . You will go broke keeping this thing in ink.Since I owned two of these and neither lasted 6 months , this thing gets a 1 star rating . I would give it a zero , but that was n't available.This is sad really , as the first Epson printer I ever bought lasted over 10 years . That is why I bought the Epson brand again . But , apparently , Epson now just makes junk . And I have never in my life seen a printer that blows through so much ink . Unless you have a Office Max or something next door , you will spend oodles of gas money going back and forth to the store to buy ink.I will never buy another Epson . The quality of the printers are terrible and they use more ink than I breathe air . Absolute junk .	-1
We Purchased this printer a few months ago ( August 2009 ) : A Total Piece of Junk.It printed 4 documents - read that 4 - and the ink tanks where down 50 per cent.After 15 documents at non-photo quality , the ink tanks where empty . The printerspent more time cleaning itself instead of printing like it had a bad case of diarrhea.Epson laid a egg with this model ( Like most of them ) Also the noise it makes before andduring printing seems like it is going to explode or nearly something like that.The Ink Cartidges cost more than the printer ( not surprised ) , but we dumped for another model . Stay Far away from this monster , unless you loved being frustratedand told that your ink cartridges are `` not recognized '' or empty after a short use.If Epson is EVER brought before a congessional hearing for fleecing its customerswith $ 8,000+ per gallon of its ink , the prosecution should use this model as anexample of the ink-waste-hog it produced . If this machine were quiet ( which is totallythe opposite ) all you will hear is the sound of your wallet shrinking as your money evaporates over ink cost . This monster sucks more liquids than a runner on steroids.Avoid like a bad infection.Daniel James Tyler ( The Walters Judson Group )	-1
I used these in my new brother printer and was delighted with the savings , until my printer broke down.It is best to use these only after your printer warranty expires . They void your warranty . My printer is only two months old and I just spent $ 250 to replace it . Now my Brother printer and remaining cartridges are headed for the waste bin.An expensive lesson learned.I ca n't say that these ink carts caused the printer 's failure , it could have been an issue with the printer itself rather than the ink . Regardless of the cause , losing the warranty on a new item does not justify the savings .	-1
Product is $ 39 , SHIPPING IS $ 74 ! ! ! For a product that weighs about 15 pounds . Stay away from these people .	-1
Maybe I 'm a complete dope , but I managed to mangle two of these boxes trying to assemble them - despite attempting to closely follow the directions printed on the box . Once I finally got them assembled , I did n't feel like the sections lined up neatly and am wondering if over time that if that will affect the integrity of the construction.And for the life of me , I could not figure out how to secure the box with the little flaps . It was n't until I looked at the Amazon product page and watched the little video to see that they are to be tucked inside the carrying handles that I got it.I do n't know ... free boxes from the liquor store seem so much easier ...	-1
I much prefer the boxes with fitted lids or the boxes with built in ties . These do not stay closed when full during movement .	-1
I Just received an email from DYMO , that effective June 11 , 2013 , I will need to enter an activation code present on each roll of DYMO brand labels to continue using their online postage program for free . If I choose to use a third party label manufacturer , it will cost me $ 9.95 per month to use my printer . Way to go and ruin a great product by only making it compatible with your own seriously overpriced labels . My new advice on this product is ... If you are going to use this as a printer , fine . But do NOT buy this if you are going to use it for internet postage.MY PREVIOUS REVIEW : I was quite skeptical when purchasing this product . Usually hardware that says it 's PC & Mac compatible falls short on one of those platforms . Not so here ... this little printer works like a charm on my iMac . It 's a breeze to install , paper is easy to load , and the software is both graphically pleasing and incredibly easy to use . You can copy and paste addresses right into the program and it will check to see if it is a valid address , add the +4 to your zip codes automatically , and even print the USPS barcode on the label for faster sorting . It even integrates with Mac OS X and allows you to print labels by selecting anyone in your Mac 's address book . Also , printing your own postage is a huge convenience . There is no extra cost for buying postage online , just the cost of the label , which if bought in bulk or manufactured by a third party , is really quite cheap . For the convenience of not having to go to the post office to buy stamps , the cost of the labels is a fair trade-off . It makes addressing packages and envelopes a total pleasure instead of a hassle . You can also use a USB scale to automatically calculate postage based on weight . This will calculate shipping for first class , as well as priority and express mail service . All around an excellent product and well worth the price.Two Important Tips : 1 ) When installing a new roll of labels , there will be some sticky residue left from the glue put there to keep the spool from unraveling . Peel off the label with the sticky stuff on it before feeding it through your printer to prevent the residue getting on the paper feed roller . If the glue gets on the roller , it is likely to cause paper jams . 2 ) This printer uses thermal paper , not ink . The labels are best used for shipping , or things that require temporary labeling ( less than six months ) . These labels WILL fade after time , and will fade very quickly if left in direct sunlight or in an overly hot environment . This is not a shortcoming of this printer , but of thermal paper technology in general . If you are looking to use this for long term labeling , I would recommend using a different labeler like a Brother P-Touch.UPDATE : This first one of these worked so well at work , I have purchased a second one for home and added a USB scale to each . Very Very happy with this purchase . Highly recommended !	-1
This product is the printer only . To print stamps on it , you have to use the Dymo Stamps program . To use that program , they require you to use labels that they sell for about 9 cents per stamp each . Generic labels wo n't work because you need an activation code on the labels . The generic labels themselves retail for a penny , so you are basically paying them 8 cents per stamp.We use about 12 stamps per week , so the fee is going to be about $ 4 per month . If that 's worth it , this is the product for you . If you send more than 25 pieces of mail , you can buy an account for $ 9.95 per month that lets you use the generic stamps.You can buy stamps online at usps.gov and they will deliver them to your door for free .	-1
I am glad I purchased this Label Writer for labels . By the way , it comes with a roll of starter stamps . I set up a `` free '' account with Dymo 's Endicia postage . Using their software , I assigned a cost center or client for each postage transaction and printed stamps on the machine . Then I discovered a major problem . Endicia modified their policy at the end of 2012 . If you have a `` free '' account , you must purchase Dymo stamps to print postage . You must enter an activation code every 200 stamps . Dymo stamps are sold in rolls of 200 , and are accompanied with an activation code . The Dymo stamps are grossly overpriced , and it costs between seven and ten cents for each Dymo stamp compared to about one cent for generic stamps . It is easier and smarter , to purchase post office stamps.Although Dymo advertises the Endicia account as a `` free account . '' A truthful description would be a `` pay as you go account '' rather than a `` free account . '' In my opinion , the company might benefit by being a little more honest . Ostensibly one is forced to purchase the Dymo stamps prevent use of counterfeit stamps or inferior stamps that are rejected by the postal authorities . '' Yet , if you pay between $ 10 . And $ 20 . per month for a subscription account , they do n't care ... in that case you are free to use generic stamps . As if by magic , paying a monthly subscription makes the problem of counterfeit or inferior stamps disappear . I am not that dumb , nor am I that easily duped.I no longer use the machine for stamps . I do use it to print labels . I loaded a roll of large labels on the left , and smaller labels on the right . I use the large labels to mail flats , and the smaller labels for file folders and some envelopes . I am still happy I purchased the machine . If you live very far from a post office , you may sign up for a subscription account . You will then pay between $ 10 . and $ 20 . per month , and you can purchase generic stamps at about 1 cent per stamp .	-1
Updated to say that the new Dymo Labelwriter 450 stopped working just like the last one did . I got it to work again for a month or so , but then it stopped permanently . It is n't compatible with my OS X version 10.7.5.That means I had to find a different Labelwriter for my computer , and it was n't easy . I finally found the Seiko Smart Label Printer and could n't be happier . It 's so much easier to use . I had used the Seiko years ago , but somehow switched to Dymo . Dymo has now lost me as a customer because their products are n't compatible with my Macintosh . That was time and money I ca n't get back again.Here is what I wrote previously , before my Dymo Labelwriter permanently quit on me , totally incompatible with my Mac : Previously over the years I could n't imagine being without my old Dymo Labelwriter , which is no longer supported after a Mac system upgrade apparently . That thing could do no wrong ! This one does everything and does it fast -- -but lost a couple of the 'simple ' functions that I enjoyed , and the instructions for a Mac user were not very helpful . They need to get someone who actually USES A MAC to write the Macintosh instructions . Just a suggestion.Now that I 've calmed down after the one-star review I wrote yesterday ( See below ) , I 'll bump it up to a 4-star review , [ Note : I bumped it back to 1 star again because it no longer works at all ] because the product actually is probably the best available . [ Note : I do n't think that now ] I do think that the product and/or the user manual must have been designed/written by someone with an intense dislike for Macintosh computers . I did finally get the address book created . However , I 'm not used to having to click the X-box for the address I want to print , copy it and paste it into the print box.However , the LabelWriter 450 does just about anything one could want it to do . It does much more than I will ever want it to do . It 's FAST.Please see my original rant ( review ) , written after a frustrating several days trying to understand the online user manual : '' There seems to be no way to create a new address book . That means each time I want to send something to the people I send things to twice a week , I ca n't just pull up their name and address . I have to search for it in my database and retype it -- -each time . I have wasted HOURS trying to read the user manual and find a way to do this . I am furious ! I had to update from my last Dymo Labelwriter , which I liked very much and would n't be without , but it suddenly refused to close . Then I found that Dymo no longer supports that version . I bought this one as a compromise and it does n't work for me . I would not recommend this product to anyone who uses a Macintosh . '' -- -original review updated above after I calmed down a bit . I 'm still annoyed that they just stopped supporting my old LabelWriter .	-1
The ink does not last ! I figured the generic version would be similar , but even though this is a high-yield generic , it did not even last as long as the trial toner that came with the printer . It was a complete waste of money , just spend a little more money and buy the brand version .	-1
While you certainly ca n't beat the price for this toner , after using this cartridge for four months , the cartridge is leaking and coverage is poor.I 'm disappointed in the quality of this unit . Usually I can get almost a year of use from a cartridge , but not on this one . I would buy a different brand in the future .	-1
These compatible cartridges were cheap , and they lived up to their price ! They are not good cartridges at all . They smear ink on the paper , and are not very well made . Spend a little more and get the true HP branded cartridges !	-1
The advertised `` low price '' induced me to buy the `` Brother TN-360 Compatible Brand Toner ( High Yield Version ) '' for my HL-2170W printer , but what a surprise ! The laser toner cartridge ( sold by `` i8International Ink '' or `` INK4WORK , '' not sure ) was received covered with ink powder on both sides of the unit and on the yellow protective shield covering the ink roller . I carefully cleaned the sides with a soft cloth , removed the dirty shield and cleaned that also . I then tried the toner , but it just did n't function properly ; sometimes the copies were dirty and messy and sometimes no copies at all . I replaced the cartridge with my old one , which still had an adequate supply of ink in it , and no problem ! Furthermore , the ink cartridge I received was not new , but looked like something that came out of a city dump . Unfortunately , this has been my experience with this product . Based on other customers ' reviews , apparently I 'm not the only dissatisfied customer .	-1
I 've been using Mead products for over 30 years . My husband works and volunteers in many local schools , and sees students and teachers both still using Mead products . So , I asked him to put it through the paces and let me know what he thought ... we were n't impressed.If this 3-Pack is representative of the rest of Meads products , I have to ask : Why ? First , here is what I like about this product : The plastic cover is durable and the back cover also seems built to last.Now , what I do n't like : The lines on the paper are almost invisible . Is this some attempt to save money on ink ? No wonder legible handwriting is going the way of the dinosaur.The perforations are non-existent . Seriously , I tried on several different pages to tear out the paper along the `` dotted lines '' . Not happening . Either the entire page tore out of the spiral , or the paper itself tore . I tried removing the frayed edges after the fact , nope . Once again I ended up with a torn page.This new feature is odd . It is supposed to make it so you can use both sides of your notebook at the same time . Couple of problems : 1 . ) The ring binding in the middle of the notebook is still in the way . 2 . ) These little tabs are n't going to last . Maybe if they were made out of the plastic on the front cover and not the box board on the back.I think instead of re-inventing the wheel , Mead should go back and look at what is really important : lines you can see and pages that tear out cleanly .	-1
I bought this printer 2 months ago . If you use it in a home with moderate use the cost per page just shocked me . I thought maybe the included cartridges were not full versions so I ought a set of xtra capacity cartridges . The same thing and I was doing most of my printing on draft . I learned from past experiences that if one buys a printer with high consumables it is best to cut your losses early . a 100.00 mistake .	-1
Returned it . The ink was not compatible with my computer . So I ca n't really rate this product . I have no further comments to say .	-1
My Canon 560 keeps kicking these cartridges with not able to read the chip . I have to open the printer , lift out the offending cart. , reinstall , etcToo much time wasted to gat a simple page printed . However the final print is decent .	-1
When I initially received the ink tanks in the mail , one of them had a broken latch -- the plastic part that holds the tank in the printer . I contacted the company and received a replacement tank free of charge . Great customer service , so no issues there . Print quality is fine , too -- again , no complaints in that department.Yesterday , I needed to replace one of my color tanks . Every single replacement tank from this company ? The computer chip had come unattached from the tank , rendering them useless for my Canon printer . Poor adhesive ? Poor quality ? Who knows . I just know I had to run to the store and spend money on an OEM tank . I checked some of the other tanks that I have yet to use ... Half of the chips have separated from the tank . Half are okay . Of the 10 original tanks -- including the one with the defective latch -- five are able to be used.This company has not saved me any money , and I highly suggest you order elsewhere if you want non-OEM tanks . I prefer non-OEM , as they are less expensive , but this is the first time I have ordered from this company . I will not do it again .	-1
The receiver will not stay on the phone EVER if you hang it on a wall . It 's not much better as a desk phone because the cradle is so light it flies off the table when you pick up the receiver , if you 're not careful . I place it next to me on the bed when I want to use it and put it away on the bedside table the rest of the time . As a phone it works , the ringer rings and voice reception is good and for the price I ca n't complain.You also can not replace either cord with a longer one as they are not removable .	-1
I bought this to confirm our land line had not been destroyed by lightning , it is HORRIBLE . It did what I wanted though , proved the land line worked so I could invest in a much better phone .	-1
It seems these must be made of recycled paper , or at least a very high proportion of recycled paper , with the result that they tear when you try to erase something on them . They are scratchy , and the pink pads are much more muted than shown in the photograph . The blue is also a bit duskier . On the other hand , they tear cleanly and I love the size -- perfect for jotting down a day 's worth of phone messages or a shopping list .	-1
For some reason Vtech decided to provide a 2.5mm jack and an attachable belt clip for the handset that comes with the base unit but the only additional compatible handsets that can be bought from Vtech omit the jack for a standard headset and omit the belt clip . Instead the 6101 handsets have a speaker phone . You can not buy an exact copy of the `` Model 6151 '' handset that comes with the base unit.I can walk around hands free and have the handset attached to my belt and a headset on my head and take calls and talk to people on the phone . I can not do this with a handset 's speaker phone held in my mouth or stuck in a pants ' pocket . Vtech needs to talk to people outside of the factory who actually use handsets before disabling current features and adding new capabilities that may be of little or no actual value.Speaker phones are useful when 2 or more people need to participate in a call from one end of the line . Otherwise the sound quality is lower for people at both ends than when using a headset and the portability aspect is lost as well as you can not walk around while using the speaker phone but have to place it down and talk or hold it in your hand ( at which point there is no reason to use it in speakerphone mode ) .I sent mine back and bought a Uniden 2-line cordless phone base unit and handsets instead . All the Uniden headsets have both a speaker phone capability and a jack for a headset and they have a belt clip . Functions are laid out better on the Uniden and it has the external antenna on the base station for greater range . Much better setup for the money than the Vtech 2-line cordless phones in every way .	-1
Okay ... I made a rookie Amazon shopper mistake . I knew better than to buy this . The review were horrible but my husband ( points finger at him ) said he had one just like it when he lived in Chicago . He took it out whenever he had shopping to do . It hauled groceries , books from the library , gym stuffs , and what else do bachelors drag around with them in Chicago ? I do n't know . Anyways ... whatever he had was n't this . So do n't listen to him . Do n't buy it . He is wrong . Very . Very . Wrong.Day 1 of cart ... instructions are worthless . It says it goes one way but it goes a different way . My husband threw them away after 5 minutes and said they were wrong . Thankfully he is handy . It goes together and looks just like the picture . He is so excited for me . I have lots of space to drag all kinds of stuff to and from my classroom . I am not so excited . The cloth bag is a bag . It does not look like a pretty square in the picture . The top is all floppy and its flimsy.Day 2 ... . we lived in an apartment at the time so we roll ... errr ... drag this out the the SUV . It has no shocks , it hits and finds every bump and cranny . Its big and bulky ... good thing I have a big SUV . So far ... I am not feeling the love for this and hubby is a little upset that I do n't like his gift that he is still very excited about.Day 3 ... its still in the SUV . I did n't take it out at school . Ummm ... I forgot ? ? Anyways , hubbys says since its in the car we should use it to bring in the groceries . 5 bags of food ... no cans . Cart is groaning under the weight . What happened to up to 110 lbs ? This is more like 25 ? Get it to the house and one of the wheels is slightly bent.Day 4,5 , something something ... it sits in my house like an eye sore . So do n't like this thing ! Day something or other ... its been about a week now . We go and buy 6 gallons of water . Hubby grabs the cart determined to show me what a great cart this is and all its magic . Are you ready for the magic ... yep ... the metal that holds the wheels on BENT and it rolled no more . How many gallons of water does it take to kill this cart 3 ! 3 ! ! ! ! And so that is how the cart died and was trashed . Poor husband had to admit this cart is horrible and the wife was happy because she ( and her fellow Amazon reviewers ) were right !	-1
Post-It has a ton of products , numerous flags and tags , and frankly these tabs are n't worth it . I 've placed a price comparison below , as well as an analysis of the merits of the different tabs to illustrate my point.This Product : Post-it Durable Index Tabs , 1 '' , Ideal For Binders And File Folders , Assorted Colors , 36 per Dispenser ( 686L-GBRT ) : $ 4.10 / 36 tabs , 7.6 cents/sq in . and 11.4 cents/tabPros : Strong thick tabs , white area to write on.Cons : Can not write on them easily with gel pens , too narrow for long file names , sized for books or papers but overpriced for that purpose.Post-it Durable Index Tabs , 1 Inch , Ideal For Binders And File Folders , Assorted Primary Colors , 66 per Dispenser ( 686L-GBR ) : $ 6.90 for 66 tabs , 7.0 cents/sq in . and 10.5 cents/tab.Identical to the previous tabs , but a better price/tab**BEST BUY FOR MARKING SPOTS**Post-it Flags , 1 Inch , Ideal For Marking & Flagging Paper Documents , Asstorted Colors , 50 per Dispenser , Four Dispensers per Pack , BONUS Durable IndexTabs : $ 9.10 / 250 tabs , 2.4 cents/sq in . and 3.6 cents/tab.Pros : Slightly easier to write on , ideal for marking books . Way Way cheaper than the file tabs.Cons : A little bit flimsier , perhaps . Colored base , makes writing a little harder to see.Post-it ( R ) Durable Tabs 686F-1 , 2 in x 1.5 in ( 50.8 mm x 38 mm ) Beige , Green , Red , Canary Yellow 24 pk/cs : $ 4.99 / 24 tabs , 6.9 cents/sq in . and 20.8 cens/tab.Pros : Ideal for files , with a 2 in . width . Strong . If you want 1 in tabs you could cut them in half.Cons : Same issue with gel pens as other file tabs , still expensive/tab . **BEST BUY FOR FILE FOLDERS**Post-it Durable Filing Tabs , 2 Inches , Ideal For Binders And File Folders , Assorted Bright Colors , 24 per Pack ( 686F-1BB ) : $ 3.99 / 24 tabs , 5.5 cents/sq in . 16.6 cents a tab.Identical to the other large file tabs but $ 1.00 cheaper and more fluorescent colors ( color is only actually on top of the tab ) .Conclusion : There is nothing wrong with this product per-se , it works well , but I think its overkill for most tasks , and too small for files . Mostly however , it 's just that they are way overpriced . Choose a better priced option .	-1
Rather large for what it is . But it does work . Felt cheap and plastic like it might break easily . Squeeks in your hand as the plastic bends . Would not purchase again for sure .	-1
I bought this one and then a few months in just stopped working . Then , I also got one without the 1 GB storage , and that too is bad . My bad luck ? Not sure , but for about $ 50 it 's not worth trying.Per some other people 's suggestion , I bought a much cheaper one and it 's entirely fine.Kingston is difficult to work with for returns . So- you 're taking your chances .	-1
I do n't like being stuck behind a lectern while making a presentation . It 's just not natural to stand in a corner blockaded from students or from the people you are talking to . So I love a good clicker and sincerely wish this one would have worked . This had a couple of problems.I 've had really good luck with Kensington products being compatible with Macs ; however , this one just would n't stay connected . The directions included with this were woefully inadequate . It 's possible that I just never needed directions from Kensington before.The second problem is that I am not able to use the clicker reliably . After experimenting about why this would n't work with my Mac , I finally got it to work by unplugging my fan and changing USB ports . The problem is that I am not always in a position to do this . PLUS , there 's the question of whether I am willing to do this every time I need to use it.The laser pointer worked perfectly and I found that was helpful . My husband is fond of pointing out that the human eye is much more sensitive and receptive to the color green than red . From 550 to 600 nanometers is the peak sensitivity of the human eye in terms of the spectrum . We identify that as slightly yellow green . The green laser may or may not be brighter than the red one . In human vision , we see the green color more efficiently than the longest wave-lengths which are red . I just like the green better than the standard red.Oh , and watch where you point it . It annoys the eye as much as the red . It takes a while to see all of the colors again . It was not my intention to find that out .	-1
UPDATE : Everything that I said below is true however I think it is important to note that I only used this printer for a short period of time and then replaced it with an Epson that has more features so I never got the opportunity to test the longevity of the printer cartridges . I appreciate those who brought this to my attention in the comments section . So it looks like Lexmark is up to playing with the cartridges again . They engineer a short life span in them . Here is a copy and paste of what I said when I first wrote this review about the trick they engineered into the X83 ; `` Lexmark X83 , although I loved the machine one of my pet peeves was that when the electricity went off , like during a summer storm , the printer , even though it was off , when the juice was restored , it would turn on , and place the cartridge in the middle of the carriage , and just sit there for days drying out , unless I would notice it , and go over and hit the power button , which would immediately park the cartridge in the protective position . Needless to say , I went through more cartridges than were necessary . This one the S605 automatically parks the cartridge after a certain period of inactivity time . I would prefer that they park the cartridge after every run , but I am not an engineer , so maybe there is a reason for that beyond wanting to sell more cartridges . Hands down you can not beat a laser for saving money on printing supplies . `` So here is my original review in it 's entirety.For more years than I care to remember I used the Lexmark X83 that scanned , copied , and printed better than the competition ; yes even better than the HP 's . I took a blank check , scanned it in my brothers HP and scanned it in my Lexmark , and the resulting printout was almost scary how true to life it was and the colors were more accurate . That being said , I quickly became a Lexmark printer fan . The one problem is that I hated having to buy the expensive cartridges . This S605 comes with multiple cartridges , so when you run out of yellow for example that is the only one you have to purchase , instead of dumping the whole cartridge when only one color is low.Then I discovered the advantages , and economy of laser printers . The ink never dries out because it is already dry powder . With its large capacity it comes to a penny or two per page instead of the dollar plus for a full page color photo . But , for photographic excellence the inkjet 's have the reasonably priced lasers beaten . Pertaining to the text quality , the laser wins hands down . I admit that I took out a magnifier to see the real difference , but the difference between the laser on black and white text and this Lexmark , the S605 was substantial ( under a maginfiying glass ) . Inkjets , this one included spray out wet ink and that causes slight fuzziness on the edges when compared to a laser my latest laser purchase , which was theBrother HL-2170W 23ppm Laser Printer with Wireless and Wired Network InterfacesThat one is a network ready wireless unit but does not scan , nor does it copy , have color capabilities or any of the sophisticated web enabled touch screen features of this S605 . So if you want to print out the occasional photo and enjoy color capabilities , and being a Lexmark fan , I highly recommend this S600 . One other thing I want to mention is that after comparing the print quality results of both the laser and the inkjet is that although the inkjet costs more for ink costs it also creates a much higher quality , thicker richer text image . It looks like it was poured on the page . The laser prints cheaper but in addition to the powder equation , it also uses less ink resulting in a thinner text ; clear clean but thinner.With the color instead of all black and white reminds me of some marketing and advertising data I had read . They conducted a study to measure the comparison between an all black text written advertisement , and the same ad with a second color , and the one with 2 colors produced 40 % better results . I printed out a page with all black text , and just a small logo in blue that immediately attracted me to the page , rather than just a boring page of plain text . Of course there are color lasers as well , but they are usually more expensive in making the initial purchase . For about the same money , you can pick up the brother 2170W and this printer and have the best of both worlds , plus you have the ability to have printers in 2 locations . With both printers loaded , you always have the option of a printing job coming right out alongside of you , or from coming from the printer in a more distant location ( another room for example ) in the other format.Setup was relatively easy . I tried the CD setup to automatically recognize my Verizon supplied wireless router for FIOS and it did n't automatically setup using the one touch button on the router as instructed . But when I went with the USB cable wireless setup , I was able to choose manual setup and it worked like a breeze . I was surprised to see that the manual setup was that easy ; all that all I needed was to input my WEP key number when it asked for it , and it took care of the rest . So overall Lexmark did their engineering , and made setup very easy . I was also pleased that I could add another computer , or as many as I would like , even my XP machines . My interest in newer printers was due in part to my need to find something that would work with Vista and XP in the same network.The web enabled touch screen feature is impressive . It has a large LCD screen right on the front of the printer that you can actually access the web from as well as a lot of other functions . It 's the most modernistic approach for a printer that I have seen . All you do is create a user name and account to access Lexmark 's `` Smart Solutions '' such as Apple Hot News , Business Card Scan , Eco Copy , Google Calendar , Mobile Me Photos , MSNBC Headlines , and more ... Once you have saved your choice of these solutions , they are immediately ready to use right at your fingertips on the printers touch screen . So this printer does a lot more than just scan , copy and print.One last thing that I want to mention is that when I was using the Lexmark X83 , although I loved the machine one of my pet peeves was that when the electricity went off , like during a summer storm , the printer , even though it was off , when the juice was restored , it would turn on , and place the cartridge in the middle of the carriage , and just sit there for days drying out , unless I would notice it , and go over and hit the power button , which would immediately park the cartridge in the protective position . Needless to say , I went through more cartridges than were necessary . This one the S605 automatically parks the cartridge after a certain period of inactivity time . I would prefer that they park the cartridge after every run , but I am not an engineer , so maybe there is a reason for that beyond wanting to sell more cartridges . Hands down you can not beat a laser for saving money on printing supplies.I 'm glad I have this , and am already looking forward to being able to print T-Shirts , with the iron ons for fun , and cards , photos etc . I also like the idea of having a scanner handy . The only thing is that I wish I had gotten the one with the 4 way that does faxes as well . Overall a nice machine with tons of features not normally found in a printer and I also have to say that my 10 year old X83 's never failed , so I am expecting a long life out of the S605 as well . From one Lexmark fan to another , buy it .	-1
Setting this printer up for the first time is a bit interesting . The ink cartridges and print heads are hidden inside the printer . It 's a miniature easter egg hunt to find the pieces you need . Then , of course , the ink cartridges do n't quite click into their slots as definitively as you might hope , so that takes a bit of trial and error . Setting the printer to work when connected to the computer takes a while of watching the software work , but is pretty brainless . Getting it to work wireless is a process full of mystery and confusion . I followed all the steps , and it did n't work because my computer could n't detect the printer , even after the printer itself had found the wireless router . Annoyed , i went to lunch , and when i came back , my computer could detect the printer . So , eventually it got it to work , and i do n't exactly know how ( i have a degree in Computer Science , by the way ) .Once everything 's talking to everything , it 's great . My only complaint is that i keep opening the whole printer instead of just the lid to the flat-bed scanner . It does n't break anything , but it is annoying.The touch-screen is responsive , and the icons are big enough that adult fingers can hit them reliably . The almost-one-touch copying/scanning is handy.Ok , apparently i lied , i have another complaint : scanning to your computer is handled very strangely . Instead of just scanning to jpg or pdf , as it does when you 're scanning to a USB drive or memory card , it scans to an application . Not only is that strange , but it 's opaque . There 's no indication on the scanner itself of why , for example , scanning into Preview ( on a mac ) will produce a TIFF while scanning to photoshop will produce a jpg . It 's so , so easy to scan to a USB drive , i wish i could just tell the printer to dump a PDF on my desktop . When you do scan to your computer , you can choose to 'scan to file ' , which opens up a window on your desktop ( on a mac , at least ) that lets you choose the format , but that 's still several steps more than it should be.There are little perks , too , like the microfibre cloth to clean the scanning glass , and a USB printer cable ( no printer i 've participated in unpacking in the past five years has had a cable packaged with it , until this one which , ironically , is wireless-capable ) . -- Updating after many weeks of use : I 'm beginning to wonder if my printer is possessed . It turns itself off after being idle for a while , which is great . Now , though , it randomly turns itself on as well . And yesterday , a new quirk : it turned itself off in the middle of printing , causing a massive paper jam . Now it 's printing fine again , but it grabs each new sheet of paper with such force that it crimps the center of the top edge . I 've fiddled with it to no avail . I 'll be calling customer service when i have a chance. -- Updating after many more months of use : Suddenly , my printer stopped printing PDFs . It popped up an error message that exists nowhere that google can find . I updated my drivers and the printer 's firmware , but that did n't work . Then i tried the online chat tech support . The first agent i got suggested i uninstall the printer and re-install it . I did . It still did n't work . So he said i should do it again . I ended the chat , and started a new one . This time i got a different agent who was actually helpful . They ended up having to do desktop sharing to fiddle with all of the settings , eventually setting up a special PDF preset that actually prints . So after 2 hours , they did n't fix the problem , but did give me a kludge to at least get by . Thus , i subtract one more star due to horrible , horrible tech support .	-1
Avery Products have been around for such a long time , their name is synonymous with labels , quality labels ! But something happened with these hand label pads ; they are not necessarily needed , and their usage is limited . This is the kind of product that gets lost in the office or home ! Yes , the labels can be carried in your purse , briefcase , or manbag , whatever you carry . They can be used to jot down notes , addresses while in the car or work ; the small plastic bag is handy for carrying the labels for multipurpose usage . You can use them for mailing labels as I have done . You must write fairly small for this task.The labels are conveniently stacked on a hard backing for writing . Three colors are available . This would make color coding good while using office files . The labels are made with a small section for grabbing the label without touching and adhesive , however the labels do curl up if not careful.So ... .what 's the problem ? ? THEY DO N'T HAVE ENOUGH ADHESIVE ! ! ! So , carry your Scotch clear tape with you , otherwise , you are writing on paper.A better product , try theAvery To/From Shipping Label Pad , 40 Labels ( 45280 ) ... ..Rizzo	-1
Executive Summary - It 's hard to find a use for these that other things do n't do better . And the product 's flaws make it a questionable solution for things that you do use it for.These labels are fighting for space in the weakly adhesive note niche dominated by Post-It notes . Avery 's idea is to make a weakly adhesive note specialized for labels.Problem . When you want to put a label on something , you want the label to stay there . You ca n't rely on these labels to do that under normal conditions . The part of the label on the opposite edge of the tear away tab curls up when you pull it off the pad . Then , when you apply the label - that curled part will pull away by itself after a few minutes . If you push it down , it pops right up again . The adhesive is too weak to hold it down against the curl of the paper . This happens on every surface ( paper , cardboard , smooth plastic , rough plastic , painted wood ) I tested except for clean glass . This can be a problem if you have the label on a moveable item - like a file folder . Put these labels on 10 file folders . Lay those folders out on a desktop - move them around - let one slide over another . Stuff you would actually do in the real world . There 's a good chance that curled up part will catch on another folder and peel right off . Worse than useless ! So you can only use these labels on things that do n't move or come into contact with moving things - like sticking them on a wall or a chart . But a Post-It note would work just as well in that situation.On the positive side , the labels are easy to write on . When you pull them off there is no adhesive residue . They look good . Since they 're not actually harmful , I ca n't give them a one star .	-1
While I understand there is a need for temporary labels , I ca n't imagine a use for the file folder tab labels , which are advertised as staying in place , but don't.Unlike their competitors , the Avery labels have adhesive on the entire back . On the plus side , they have a nice retro look with the rectangular box on them.But the problems far outweigh their good looks . The pad is cumbersome to use and a single label is hard to get off . They curl almost immediately , so you have to put them on a surface . I tried them on a number of surfaces and they did n't stay put on any of them.Definitely a product not worth buying !	-1
I 've had a package of these things for a couple of weeks now and I still ca n't think of a legitimate use for them that could n't be accomplished just as well with a Post-It Note or one of their clones.If I re-used a lot of file folders , I guess these might come in handy.I showed them to my wife , who is a newspaper editor and an avid quilter and she could n't think of a good use for them either.It 's kind of like being handed some strange , obscure tool or part and being asked to identify it.I 'm giving this product 2 stars , the second one being just for the benefit of the doubt.I hope Avery did n't bet the farm on this one .	-1
Not much to comment on : Pros : 3 different colors , nice clean design , removable tab , reusable , writable , does n't leave glue residue behind , 120 labels / $ 3.79 or 3.2 pennies per label , with free shipping if you have Amazon Prime or net purchase of > $ 25.Cons : NOT VERY STICKY , not printable . These labels come off so easily from most surfaces that I find them not very helpful at all . This defeats the purpose of having a label and negates all pro points ; hence the 1/5 star .	-1
These labels are basically a peel off and stick product on a small note type pad . This makes them very easy to store or kepe on desk but you have to handwrite them . Also , I found that they tend to stick together and you have to be careful peeling so you only get one . There is also a tab at the end to tear off but often tears the label when you do so and is stubborn to remove . I used them for some home office work and they were fine for that or if you were a student they would be easy tocarry around and label folders with but they would leave something to be desired in a professional office .	-1
Nothing special about these labels . I find they do not adhere as well as 3M products ( post-its ) . In addition , it is easy -- too easy -- to remove more than one label when all you wanted was one . Overall , I was not impressed and wo n't order this product again .	-1
To send boxed items , I go to my word processor , type in the address , center it and make the font large , print it , fold the paper small enough to put it on the package , and then tape the heck out of it . So I thought these self-adhesive labels would be a great alternative . The great part is that they are self-adhesive , but it kind of ends there . They are all the same color -- blue , in the case of the package I used . The `` from '' address is in a top box and the `` to '' in a larger box below , but there was little to separate them and I found myself reluctant to use the `` from '' box for fear that the post office would get confused and send the box back to me , which would have been bad ! I just think that the product could be a lot `` sexier '' -- bright colors that make the `` to '' and `` from '' stand out more , for example.Also , and this is picky and just silly , but I had a hard time peeling off the backing . Turns out the label is centered on a larger piece , so you peel it off from the front not the back , if you follow me . But I was working on the back for quite some time before I figured that out !	-1
Ok , so I admit it . I often use postal service shipping labels that are 'technically ' used for priority mailing , cut them down ( to take off the reference to 'priority ' ) and use them for standard mailing of items . So , I guess feeling guilty that I was 'stealing ' , when I saw these shipping labels on Amazon , I scapped them up in a heartbeat . Unfortunately , I find these labels too small for my taste . In order for me to handwrite my return address and shipping address ( and with a son in the military overseas there are 5 lines of address I need to enter ) , I found the labels inadequate . Perhaps if I had a really tiny handwriting , or if I was able to some how type labels ( where are the oldfashioned typewriters when you really need them ? ) , they would work fine . But for my use , I do n't like them and would not purchase them in the future.Glue seems adequate , so I am sure they hold fine , it 's the size that is no good for my shipping .	-1
These are your basic , file folder , self-stick labels , designed for 1/3 tab file folders . ( Where the tab is a third the size of the folder itself -- these labels are a full three inches long . ) I find most of my folders have smaller tabs , so these are often overly large and need to be cut down to work , thereby eliminating any benefit from the notepad form factor of the labels , designed for ease-of-use and hassle-free storage.While , it 's true you might not loose this `` pad '' of labels in your desk drawer as easily as standard , loose sheet labels , if they 're not the size you need , they 're pretty useless .	-1
My enthusiasm for the ease of setup has been tempered by intermittent wifi connection snafus and expensive ink refills , and today , after 3 years of very light use , ( a few pages a week , mostly monochrome text ) the printer has failed completely . Just google `` '' ink system failure HP '' and you 'll see . I followed the procedures outlined by HP to fix this , to no avail . So it was decent for a while , but ultimately did not last.I 'm a geek , and my wife is a technophobe . It took me a couple of frustrating hours to set up our previous wireless printer , a Canon MP620 . So when we got the Photosmart I was expecting more of the same . Surprisingly , my beloved wife decided that she would give installing the HP a shot . While I was cooking dinner , she installed the printer and hooked up all three of our computers ( all Macs ) and got them working very quickly . This may have something to do with HP 's implementation of Apple 's Bonjour feature , which lets you connect wireless devices seamlessly . Whatever the reason , it works beautifully . The only slight glitch we encountered was that one of the computers needed to have the driver software installed from the disk , as opposed to downloading it from the HP site . Once that was done , it was smooth sailing - a considerable improvement over installing the Canon . Print quality is also excellent , but that 's the price of entry these days - not that much different than the Canon , with a slight edge in photo printing . Text rendering is sharp , even in quick mode . Scanning works well . While both Canon and HP all-in-one printers can give you good results , the HP is so much easier to use than the Canon that there 's no contest . The HP Photosmart is our new printer of choice .	-1
I did not use the Wireless setup and did use the enclosed CD for installation.Upon receiving , I was oohing and aahing about how sleek and pretty it looked . Once I started unwrapping , I immediately started comparing to my HP C5280 . Yes , it looked nicer , but it 's obvious functions lacked in comparison.First off , it does n't print CD 's , which is not a major concern of mine , since the Sharpie is my tool of choice when needed.Secondly , it does n't scan negatives or slides . This is an option I do like to have , since I do happen to have old negatives that I 'd like to scan one day , somehow , someway , eventually it 'll happen . Just not with this All-In-One.Setup with the CD was easy enough , but slow . The calibration process and printing process is slow and noisy , although no more noisy than my C5280 , but definitely slower . I 'm an impatient person , when I hit that print button , I want the paper to load right away and get the ball rolling . This does n't happen here , nor does it with the C5280.As for the HP software , again , I 'm not a fan of HP Photo Essentials , which also came with a previous printer . I have n't given it much of a chance to give a good rating , as I hate it that much . It 's not user friendly and does n't cooperate between printers . I also have an HP Photosmart P1000 , which yes , it is a dinosaur , but has been reliable for a good 6 years . My printing software of choice , I believe , came with that printer , and is just called HP Photo Printing Software ( v 2.2.0.4 ) and is a wonderful basic image editor ( excellent for adjusting color/brightness issues ) . You can also choose the paper size and what standard size photo is to print on that media ( for example , an 8.5 x 11 page can print 4 3x5 's or 3 4x6 's or more 2x3 's , etc ) . I do n't know why HP found it necessary to deviate from that software . Another option is to install 'Windows Live Photo Gallery ' , which I 'd rather have a root canal than install any more bloated Windows products , even though I 've been a Hotmail user for years . I also do n't like the browser additions that they felt were necessary to add to my IE7 and Firefox toolbars . I do n't appreciate that kind of intrusion by ANY software manufacturer . Yes , it 's simple enough to remove them , but it would 've been nice to have been asked first ( which some installer programs will do ) .It was nice of them to include a 100 pack of 4x6 photo paper . I 'm stocked up for life as it is on photo paper as it is , so I doubt I 'll ever get to use this package . I do n't print nearly as much as I had used to since there 's enough online printing places that can accomodate for very reasonable prices . I do still print a few pictures here and there though . I printed a photo and while it did look nice , it was n't as vivid as I 'd like . I printed another copy on an HP DJ5550 and liked the latter better , although the Photosmart Plus was more natural looking . The quality was n't what I expected , but I ca n't go into that at the moment since I 'd like to print the same picture on my 2 home printers to make my final decision about the quality.All in all , I 'm not overly impressed with this item . Sure , it certainly is nice & sleek looking , but the way it performs is huge to me , and this one is lacking.EDIT : 12/2010 -- - > this printer goes through A LOT of color ink . I recently installed new HP cartridges and printed only a few 8x11 color photos and the color levels dropped significantly . The black cartridge does n't bleed out quite as fast . My default setting is to print in B & W ; , and only print with color when necessary . Unfortunately when necessary , it 's uses alot of color ink.The lack of a positional `` TouchSmart control panel '' is also a major inconvenience . My previous 5280 had one , where I could flip it up and down when needed . This one is stationary , and if you have the printer up high , you ca n't read the display .	-1
I have been a faithful HP customer for many generations of printers and I have just now reached the end of my time with them . This company can not make affordable toners ... perhaps they should try ... what a bunch of crooks ! HP ink cartridges are notoriously overpriced . The photosmart plus a decent machine but drinks more ink than a drunken sailor drinks . The cost to keep replacing the ink makes this machine not worth it ! The only way to stay out of the poor house with HP printers is to buy aftermarket ink to refill your cartridges . HP protects against this ( because they dishonestly make their cartridges run down so fast ) by not allowing the computer chip to be reset ( can someone out there make a device to do this please ) . So , you can use aftermarket ink to fill your cartridge but you wo n't get a read-out on how much ink is left ... this is really annoying.This will likely be my last HP printer ... I 'm sick of paying them so much for their ink when other companies are so much cheaper and offer the same or better quality products ...	-1
*** 02/26/11 Update ***The scanner on this printer went kaput after about six months of extremely light use . Ink consumption is horrid . You either have to use the ink quickly and replace or it will evaporate on you . Either way , look to replace ink QUITE FREQUENTLY . I was hoping it would be better than the junk HP C6380 printer it replaced , but it was n't . After having three HP printers go south on me in two years ( yes , one of the other printers initially praised below went south as well ) , I 've decided to switch brands . While the HPs were dropping like flies , I had an Epson Workforce 600 quietly working away like a good little soldier . No muss , no fuss , no problems . No weird scanning or ink system errors , just consistent reliable performance . I recently purchased an Epson 633 to replace the other HP . I will be buying Epson from now on ( unless their reliability plummets , like HP ) . Good job HP . After over a decade of brand loyalty , you 've blown it with this consumer.This is my fourth HP printer in the past year . I have two in my home and two with my children ( students ) . All of them are multi-function machines ( minus fax capabilities ) . I have been happy with all except my C6380 ( piece of junk ) . So far so good with this printer . Setup was a bit of a pain . For starters , HP eliminated the setup poster that I 've grown accustomed to . You have to insert a disk and follow the flash setup presentation . The LCD on the printer also walks you through setting up the printer , inserting the ink cartridges , and loading paper . All of these were relatively easy . In fact , I was coasting along pretty good until I tried to setup wireless on the printer itself . The printer has a touchscreen LCD , so I thought the ability to configure wireless via the touchscreen was included . I discovered you can only configure wireless via the touchscreen if you have a WPS router . I personally like to manually configure my wireless devices , so I was out of luck . With no other options , I installed the software CD-ROM and followed the setup guide . I discovered I had to temporarily connect the USB cable to configure wireless other than WPS . So , I connected and followed the instructions . I ran into a couple error messages due to my SSID not being broadcast and the software failing to initially find the printer after I configured wireless . I was able to click through both and complete setup . Although I selected custom setup and deselected all of the junkware , I still ended up with the Yahoo toolbar , HP Shopping , and MSN Live photo gallery software installed , so be careful when performing a custom installation . Make sure it confirms your choices ( unless you want those apps installed ) . After my lengthy install , the printer was ready to go . The color LCD is sharp and clear . Choices are logically laid out and easy to access . You have icons for copying ( color and B & W ; ) , scanning ( and options of where to send scanned files ) , and photo printing . You can print directly from flash devices and there is a built-in card reader . You can print photo book pages , panoramas , and other creative options without a PC . Printing was fast and quality is excellent . Noise is moderate but tolerable . Scanned images came out good and can be saved as photo files or PDF . You can easily monitor ink levels via the LCD or the HP Solutions software on your PC . The printer comes with a six foot USB cable and a 100ct pack of 4X6 HP Advanced glossy photo paper . The printer uses 564/564XL ink cartridges which do n't tend to last too long , especially if you print heavy . Just to give you an example , I 've replaced the cartridges in my C6380 three times in the past year . Ink cartridge replacement is relatively simple . Simply open the lid and the ink cartridge centers . Push the tab , pop out the cartridge and pop a replacement into the well-marked slot . Installing the printer on additional PC 's is a simple process after the initial printer setup is completed . Simply pop in the CD and the printer will be detected during installation ( just do n't forget to disable your firewall first ) .Overall , I 'm happy with this printer . Setup could be made a little easier and it 's a shame that they did n't include the ability to configure wireless via the LCD . Other than these minor gripes , printing is good , not the speediest , but good quality . Another good thing is that the CD that shipped with my printer is already stamped `` Windows 7 compatible '' , so no downloading the latest drivers if you have or plan to get Windows 7 .	-1
Okay , Santa brought this to me , and his elves were obviously tricked by salesperson ! I hooked it up today , and it 's pretty awful . I hate it . It technically does work ( hence the two stars ) , and works wirelessly . The hassle of repackaging it and returning it is the ONLY thing keeping me from exchanging it . I 'm replacing another HP printer , which worked for a couple years , before crashing . THIS one is LOUD . Is SLOW . And , kind of annoying , ..it 's one of those printers that seems to spend a ton of time `` gearing up '' and `` searching for paper '' before it prints a single page . There is nothing quick about this , in either plugged in mode , or wireless . And , while it is n't really `` hard '' to set up , the setup wizard is n't great ; particularly for the wireless set up . And , the whole thing just seems big bulky and awkward ( I 'm a MAC , I like things simple and streamlined ) . I have no idea what to recommend in it 's place , I only know I DO N'T RECOMMEND THIS ONE ! ! ! !	-1
- > Do n't review this printer until you 've had it awhile . You may be happy at first but I promise you EVERYONE says this printer is a dud BIG time , including me . Here 's my short lived story : I 've never been through so many HP printers in my life as I have been this past year including this one . So FRUSTRATING ! ! They seemed to be so great years ago and now every single one I buy , high or low end , as soon as they are out of warranty or you go for that first ink change - DONE FOR GOOD ! ! And then you 're out the expensive cost of new ink cartridges that are stuck in the printer that 's now dead and that probably cost you close to what you paid for the printer itself . I 'm VERY upset and disappointed - it 's absolute JUNK ! !	-1
Does not flow well at all in my Pilot pen . An ugly color that constantly jams . Stick with noodler ink it is much better	-1
I do n't like this new model at all . On the first day , I accidentally dropped it on the floor and the battery cap joint immediately snapped . Now I have to cover it with ugly tapes.This would never happen in the original model : I had one for many years ; The battery cap joint was sturdy and intentionally reinforced , and it survived numerous falls.I do n't understand why Logitech changed the design and made the joint tiny and fragile . They should know that shock-resistance is very important for a remote presenter .	-1
I read review from SDW222 . If this printer shuts down because one ink cartridge is empty then what good is it ? I have always loved Canon printers but when you run out of color ink you can not scan or fax even though you do n't need ink to scan or fax . Nothing works until you replace the ink . You ca n't even print black and white text document until you replace the color . Other printers do n't require that you buy color ink to print black and white which makes sense .	-1
I had an old HP all in one printer . It made a lot of noise , and did not print straight . But it worked fairly easily . I bought this printer when that one fell off the desk and broke while moving furniture . It is the most irritating printer I have ever tried to use . The magic wheel on the control panel looks great ... .but just try reducing the size or changing the size of the paper you are printing on and see what you get . I literally hate this thing . Oh yes , it operates quietly , but uses massive amounts of ink and will only print on the paper it decides to print on . So much more complicated than my old printer . It is called an all in one printer , but does not include Fax . How all in one is that ? ? ?	-1
First of all the price has dropped here at amazon.com by $ 10.00 in the 5 wks . since I ordered this ! I am using this with a USB cable so I ca n't comment on wireless set up or capabilities . It was easy to set up with USB.First of all it takes absolutely forever to warm up when initially turned on . Be prepared for grinding gyration noises that seem to intrigue my dogs but are annoying to me . It you are in a hurry to copy , scan or print , forget it ! It does not seem to have a `` sleep/power saver mode '' as an old Lexmark did . I have to get up and manually turn the printer off and on as needed . ( I have a long USB cable ) This is among the most annoying features and one that I incorrectly assumed all the latest printers had.I have not printed any photos so I ca n't comment on color quality . It does seem to print from the Internet just fine tho not as fast as I would have thought even at draft settings.Also ca n't comment on ink usage at this point but will update this review when it comes time to replace the tanks.All in all , I 'd rate this printer as just average . Clearly slow compared to others I have had because of the lengthy warm up process . Noise seems a bit above average too . If I had it to do all over , I think I 'd probably chose another model.Update Dec. 28 , 2010 - Changed my rating from 3 stars to 2 . I just discovered a footnote in the product description that I must purchase a separate adapter to read my Xd memory card ! Ridiculous ! ! ! Even my years old pathetic Kodak printer had a slot to read Xd cards without an adapter ... .IF I had known this when this arrived , I would have returned it asap ... .Now I have to buy a card reader ... .I 'm not sure now much worse this printer can get . Still slow , slow , slow and print quality just so-so . Recommend you look elsewhere.Update May 25 , 2011 - Tried all afternoon to connect this printer to my wireless network . ( windstream 's latest router/modem combo ) It would barely recognize my wireless network . Signal strength was terrible no matter where I placed the printer . The router is 1 floor directly above the printer ! ! ! Then when I would turn the printer off , it would lose all the network settings . I 'm giving up on this printer . I bought a Brother combo from hsn.com that was a breeze to set up and wireless signal is fabulous ! No more Canon printers for me ... ..	-1
Edit 06/24/2012 : Printer is dead . We 've tried everything - cleaning print head , changing ink , etc . It 's KAPUT . DO NOT BUY.I bought this printer at a big-box retailer for $ 100 . I have a long history of owning Canon printers which I 've been happy with and have lasted me a LONG time . I bought an HP because of cost , name recognition and the inks seemed to be cheaper . I am now regretting my decision.The prints themselves are ok , but there 's a laundry list of problems with this machine . * The WIRELESS , or lack thereof . I could never get this printer to stay connected to my wireless network at home . I had it connected and working for about a day or two . So finally just ran the printer cable and did away with wireless printing . Was n't worth the hassle . The wireless connection would drop constantly despite the fact that our five laptops never had issues , so clearly , the issue was with the printer . * Slow scanning . I 've owned a few scanners in my time , and this thing is SLOW . Scans are good quality , however . * Touch-screen panel - buggy . I can never get the left arrow to function unless I press down really hard , and even then , it does n't always work . The touch screen is a neat idea , but generally useless . The apps ? Are you kidding me ? Who is going to use apps on a PRINTER ? * Missing native print drivers/screen . When I go to print , all I get is the generic Windows print interface . Despite searching numerous forums , I ca n't see that HP has any solutions for the missing print drivers and the native print screen menu that 's supposed to accompany this device.So what do I like ? Well , the prints are good . That 's about it . For all the bells and whistles , well , they 're just disappointing . I was all excited to have this souped-up ( and my first ) all-in-one , but this combo disappoints . Ca n't wait to get back to Canon ... *sigh*	-1
If you do n't do much color printing , you 'll do okay with this . But the ink system in this machine is really really lousy . It works fine otherwise . I love the two-sided printing feature , and the wireless system works fine from anywhere in the house . But it really is lousy when it comes to ink cartridges . Do n't try the refill ones , it 'll just screw you up . It 'll even stop recognizing good ones , and make you take it out and replace it , over and over , to get it to recognize it . I 'm tired of HP - thinking of Epson or Canon now .	-1
I initially wrote a 4 star review with just one complaint the printer takes too long to get ready to print a first page.I deleted that review today so I can update my review to reflect the 1 star status this printer deserves . I bought this printer for the 802.11n wireless , because it also already had the other features I was looking for.HP has does a horrible job with the software drivers for this printer . It looks nice , has a great feature set , has a great price , but it 's a pain in the butt to operate . Initially it took a long time for the printer to prep itself to get ready to print the first page of a doc or photo , then when it finally printed , it was as fast as I 'd expect . A software update seemed to remedy this , however , that problem and other problems continued , such as the disappearing act the image scanner function seems to do where it will work fine one day , then the next time imaging programs ca n't find the printer and I have to re-install the printer software . Sometimes , the printer will take forever to print a color document or photo -- it just crawls along -- and I end up canceling the print job . The printer ca n't handle the canceling very well , because it will then print out several mostly blank pages with just a little printing of junk characters till you cancel that a few times and it wastes so much paper.terrible !	-1
HP has been a big name in inkjet and laser printers for quite some time . I have tested and used many HP printers over the years , and have generally been satisfied with their products . However , I have been seeing a concerning trend , of lowered quality of design , engineering , and manufacturing . So when I was given an opportunity to test an HP Photosmart printer , with the name `` Premium '' in its model name , I just had to know what was so special about this device that would warrant the use of such a powerful word.Unboxing and setting up this device was quite easy and straightforward . I connected the printer to my home network via Ethernet cable . While the printer found an available IP address quickly , via DHCP , it was a simple process for me to change the IP address to a static one via the nice touch screen display panel . My only real complaint about the installation is with the typical HP driver installation . After popping in the included installation CD , if you are n't very careful and select just the driver package , you will end up sitting in front of your computer for 15 to 20 minutes , watching a plethora of unnecessary applications being installed and wasting hard drive space ( not to mention slowing down your Windows boot-up time ) . So do yourself a favor and observe the installation steps carefully ; selecting only the drivers for printing and scanning . Nothing more is really needed , unless you have no other image editing software on your computer at all.The printer comes with a generous supply of photo paper to begin printing with , so I immediately started printing 4x6 borderless pictures . At the highest quality settings , I found the printing to be somewhat slow , but not unusually slow . This is an area where the Epson Artisan series printers really excel , as they print some very good looking photos at impressively fast speeds . But the HP is no slouch . It printed faster than I expected , and the output was crisp and colorful , with reasonable accuracy . This printer is no match , when compared to a high quality 6-color machine , but it should prove sufficient for most consumer printing needs . One nice feature is the duplex printing this model offer , allowing documents to be printed on both sides of a sheet of paper.Scanning and copying with this device is simple , and provides solid results . However , the lack of an ADF ( Automatic Document Feeder ) requires that you lay individual sheets on the glass . This is a no brainer for copying pictures , but can be a real pain if you need to copy a document containing several pages.I could go on and on about little details , but overall I have found this to be a very nice little printer to work with . I have used it primarily for printing photos , as I think that is an area where this device really shines . However , I recently ran into a serious problem that brings me doubt about the overall quality and longevity of this model . One day I powered up the printer , and on the LCD display showed an error message : `` Ink System Failure : 0xc19a0023 '' . Powering cycling the printer did nothing to correct the problem . After spending a great deal of time on the phone with HP support , which consists mostly of mindless drones in an overseas country , reading scripted support messages that almost never help anyone , it was finally determined that I needed to replace the print head assembly in the device . Still under warranty so no problem . Replacement arrived ( roughly a week later ) , and the printer worked fine again ... .for awhile . Within a couple of months , printing maybe 30 to 40 photos and a handful of documents , I started receiving the Ink System Failure message again . More time on the phone , but this time a new print head was not offered . Instead a replacement printer was suggested . I could send mine in and wait for a replacement , or I could provide a credit card number and they would ship out a replacement and let me ship my defective unit back in the same box the replacement arrived in . I decided to use that option , as I no longer had the original box this printer came in . To make a long story short , I received a refurbished printer , with no ink cartridges ( this is standard practice , so I am not complaining ) , no power supply , and as it turns out , no print head . I took the print head from the defective printer and installed in the refurbished model . After installing the ink cartridges , the replacement printer fired up and worked just fine.It has now been over a years since I received this printer for testing . The device is well out of warranty , and I am sorry to say that the replacement printer has also failed ; with the same Ink System Failure error message . Once I can understand . Twice is concerning . Three times with the same model shows a trend of poor quality control and/or faulty engineering . At this point I can not recommend this model printer to anyone . I believed it has a flawed design , and that the risk of failure is too high . The price has dropped substantially for this model ( not surprising ) , so if you are looking for an inexpensive printer that will provide good quality photo output , and are willing to risk device failure , then I guess this could be a good choice . Let 's face it , for the first year you are covered by the HP warranty . Who knows , maybe they have made some changes with this model to correct the problems . I have checked Google , to see if anyone else has had the ink system failure errors as I have , and was shocked to see an endless list of complaints about the very same issue , with this very same model ( and a few other HP models as well ) . I would personally avoid this printer , if I were spending my own hard earned cash , but for someone that needs something quick and inexpensive , that can provide good photo prints , and that would likely replace the printer within a year anyway , then I guess it would be worth considering . My conclusion is that this is a very capable printer , with a lot of nice features , but that fails do to corner cutting by HP . Still using an Epson Artisan color printer that I purchased back in fall of 2008 , which has never failed in any form ( well I did get a faulty color ink cartridge from Staples once , but that was easily rectified ) . This is not the only HP device I have tested , over the past couple of years that has proven to fail prematurely . I have to admit that my faith and loyalty in HP products is extremely unstable right now . They used to be a name that could be trusted , but I guess the poor economical times have caused them to cut costs to the point of producing inferior products . I hope they with reanalyze their business strategies , going forward , and come back as a quality name brand again .	-1
I purchased this keyboard last year for my home theater PC.The size is great for using it on your lap.The range on it is also very good . I can sit more than 20ft from the projection screen with no signal problems.It also features a trackball , which is much better than trackpads found on many competing products.Unfortunately , this trackball is on the right side . I wish it was on the left , or that the trackball component was modular and could be attached to either the left or right side.This year , I decided to purchase a second unit for my second HTPC in the bedroom.I bought one at a local retailer . Unfortunately , it turned out to have four defective keys , two digits and two letters . I had to return it . The retailer did n't have another one . I did n't like any of the other manufacturer 's designed , so , I ordered another one of these from Amazon . It was n't in stock , and took 10 days to arrive . Then , when I finally got it , I found that the second trackball button was prone to getting stuck , especially when double-clicking . The keyboard seems fine . I think the quality assurance at IOgear needs to be improved . I have to return this unit as well . 2 bad units out of 3 is inexcusable.Edit : I got the 4th one from Amazon , and it is OK . So it 's 2 bad keyboards out of 4 .	-1
Can you say `` Do n't forget to use all your new ink cartridges to TRY to clear the CLOG ? '' I now know Epson 's customer service stinks . I give up on their less than stellar inks and going to say hello to a non-Epson printer . I am NOT the kind who wants to get out my tools and service this think like a roadside mechanic . Ai n't happenin ' , I 'm just sayin'.After belonging to the exceptional ( seriously wonderful ) Epson Yahoo group , I realized I was going to stop trying to save this printer . Maybe someone else is more `` hands on '' .At the prices being asked on Amazon today ( 2/9/13 ) PLEASE think many , many times before purchasing this printer.Now , ... . you 're on your own .	-1
I 'm not happy with the Epson Workforce 1100 Wide Format Printer . I received this printer on 12-4-09 . Once I got this printer all set up , there were problems from the start . Once I installed the necessary included software onto my computer , it failed to detect it . I check my USB cable , that was fine . I checked to see if the printer was plugged in correctly , it was . However , since I have Windows 7 , I thought possibly I needed an updated printer driver . I checked their website and they did have a Windows 7 driver available for download . I download then installed it on my computer . I was still having problems . I called Epson . A tech support technician walked me through a few steps and we finally got the printer to work correctly.Once I started printing , right away I was unimpressed with the print quality . While black and white printing was good , the output in color was average at best . The color is off on a lot of my printouts and it does n't compare to my other printer . It 's actually quite a bit worse . I 've tried all kinds of paper types and weights of several different brands . I 've tried tweaking the printer settings . Nothing seemed to work . This printer comes with series 68 inks ( the high capacity inks ) which I do n't think was meant for great print quality . I figured maybe if I get the 69 series inks , which according to Epson 's website , it 's supposed to produce better quality prints , that would do the trick . I never got the chance to find out.Fast forward.Today , 12-22-09 , I got my new 69 series inks . When I went to turn on the printer to install them , the printer started malfunctioning . The green power light started blinking and shut off , then the printer started grabbing the loaded paper half way then it stopped . This resulted in the paper getting jammed in the printer . Then the load paper and load ink lights started blinking orange in unison . I had to forcefully pull out the jammed paper . I turned off the printer and took out the paper from the top feeding tray . I turned the printer back on and again the same thing started happening except this time it kept grabbing for paper which was n't there and again the orange lights would continuously blink . I barely used this printer because it was only intended for use if I need to print to larger paper . My main printer is my old Canon MX850.I called Epson and got a tech support technician . He walked me through a few troubleshooting steps and nothing seemed to work . Finally he told me this printer is experiencing a hardware failure and there was no fix . He offered to replace it but since it was within Amazon 's 30-day window plus the extended holiday return period which I believe ends 1-31-10 , I opted to just ship it back to Amazon and look for another brand printer.I purchased this printer because like I said , I needed it mainly for printing on large formats . I also purchased it because of the incredible price and great reviews . I had high hopes for this printer and I 'm really disappointed with it . I have had a previous bad experience with another model Epson printer but I did n't let that dissuade me from getting this one because I believe just because one has a problem with a particular model of a brand does n't mean it should tarnish their whole line of products . However , that 's two for two and now I 'm rethinking that idea . I 'm sorry that my luck is n't as good as everyone else 's but this is my honest experience with this product . I did plan on keeping it even though I initially was n't impressed with the print quality until it started malfunctioning for no apparent reason .	-1
After good results with Monteverde 's `` soft roll '' ballpoint refill for Parker-compatible pens , I had to get one for my boring old Cross ballpoint.Unfortunately , despite having the same description , Monteverde does NOT appear to use the same ink/ball type for the Cross refills . Unlike their Parker refills , these are n't any better than a normal ballpoint . In fact , it may even be a little bit worse.On top of the poor writing experience , the orange color is n't so good either . It 's more of a dull orange , almost on the salmon side.You never know what you will get from Monteverde .	-1
I would recommend this refill and it looks cool in green . The only down side is that it does n't last as long as the cross refills.Update : latest shipment proves to be very poor ink and partially dried . Using now for 2 weeks and is very frustrating .	-1
I bought the brown ink . It is very scratchy and spotty so it is hard to see that the ink is brown -- it looks more like a very light black . But the real problem is that while the barrels are new they skip so much you think that there is no ink left . I would not recommend the BROWN . I have n't tried other colours .	-1
This tape is strong and sticks on everything including getting the hands gummy . I used it to seal boxes . The tape held up and I learned to work with it . The sticky side is a bit gummy so it tended to gum up the tape dispenser frequently and I had to switch to cutting it with scissors . Other tape such as 3M does not gum up like this in my experience , but is not so inexpensive as this one .	-1
I ordered 60 rolls of this tape late last year because Amazon was selling it for roughly 1/2 the price of what they are charging now . It was on back-order and I had to wait 2 months for delivery . It came out to like 89 cents a roll so I did n't mind waiting . Well , now I 'm fairly disappointed with the product . IT JUST DOES N'T STICK VERY WELL ! I do a little selling on eBay sometimes and I prepared a few packages for shipment . The next morning when I was getting ready to head out to FedEx to drop them off I noticed several areas where the tape was not adhering to the box . I had to double tape around the whole perimeter of the box to make sure the tape would n't lift off in transit . I ca n't afford to get poor feedback on eBay because a customer 's item got damaged because I used some crappy tape ! Now I do n't know what to do . It could just be one bad roll - I 've only used one so far . But I think there was a reason the tape was so cheap and that 's because it 's just not that good . I expected better from a product associated with the 3M company.This probably wo n't turn out to be much of a bargain because I will have to use twice as much tape to make sure the box is properly closed . Live and learn ... UPDATE 04-22-10I 've since used 6 rolls of this tape and I have a little more confidence in it 's holding ability now . I think maybe the first roll I used was bad . I am upgrading my rating to 3-1/2 stars because while the product is not as bad as I originally described , it 's still not very sticky tape , and you have to use A LOT more of it to make sure your package is securely taped .	-1
I loved the review and price of this tape however I was not very happy with the quality . It tears mid strip to easily , it does not stretch at all . It 's adhesive properties were also lacking as the tape came off many of the ends of of the boxes . I 've used other brands of tape including `` bargain '' tape with better results .	-1
Like the other reviews about jamming , I have had the same constant problems . HP has been no help , just the corporate run around from an outsourced call center . I have only had this in `` use '' since March.I just received this email today from someone there that can not even write in complete sentences . He says '' They are reviewing the case , we do n't replaced printers for new ones after 30 days of purchase , only for refurbished , they are trying to work around on that , is not as simple as just saying yes . Please just bear with me while I received the reply . Just rest assured that they are working on in at this moment ok , as soon as I have their offer I let you know . `` This is under warranty and I am waiting for their OFFER . Under no circumstances should you buy from this company . They give you no service , and if you google this is a known issue with this printer.Addition to this review July 6th.I received a phone call today , months after my purchase and they offered to send me a new one . I listened with a smile on my face and then told them that I had purchased another printer , and that would be the last HP product in my home . Oh , my new printer , not hp , is just working great , no jams and perfect printing .	-1
This item was given to me for my review.The Quartet Stainless Steel Finish Magnetic Dry-Erase Board is a nice sized dry erase board with two pretty powerful post-it magnets . However , the item , in no way , looks like stainless steel , but just like what it is ... .silver/grey plastic . The magnets for the back of the board are not strong enough to firmly hold the board , and it slides down my fridge if you bump the board at all . I actually DO like the look , but I feel that the product is hampered by its description , which is a bit inflated for the actual product , and by the poor quality magnets that are included for the back . The company would have been better off using the same quality of magnets for the back of the board as they did the post-it magnets . If one does not choose to use the magnets , there is double sided tape that can be applied directly to the wall ... .with the knowledge that it might take off paint or paper if used that way , but that is just common sense . I think it would be great in a locker , but only if you used better magnets or used the tape because every time you shut the door , it might fall off . The board is useful , and I will use it , but it is not without defects . For the price , you are getting a functional , but only if the buyer is willing to tinker with the product to make it work properly with magnets .	-1
I wanted to love this item , it looks so nice , clean and easy to care for . I followed the instructions and placed the magnets on the back but they do n't hold well at all , the things wants to slide down the fridge . It needs stronger magnets or at the very least larger ones . I do n't know yet what to do with this since it wants to fall off all the time . I like it and want to use it . Guess I have to find some more magnets but then they have to stick out as far as the other ones to make contact which might be hard to do since the sticky pads are just that little pads that make it stand out from the fridge a little .	-1
I sometimes do need multi-colors in manuscripts . These BIC 's appeared to fit the bill.Problem is the four-barrel concept is lacking in ink capacity . In no case did a pen lastlonger than 250 words . The black capacity is generally the most generous , followed by theblue ink , which stands out nicely . The green and red are too light and very fine-lined , nowhere nearly as robust as the black or blue.I still keep standard black , blue , and red Bic pens readily available . I give up ontheir 4-color cousins .	-1
This pen was fantastic . I loved the smooth , clean , smudge-free writing and the feel of the pen . I was sure I had a new favorite . Until this morning , when it abruptly ran out of ink.Yes , I have used this pen for essentially all my writing for about three weeks . But we 're not talking pages of journal entries or anything here - just basic , every day use . I have never had a brand new pen run out of ink this fast in my life ! Even the el-cheapo bic pens ( while much less delightful to use ) last ages compared to this ! I still have one more pen from the pack to use , but after that ( as much as I loved them ) I doubt I 'll be buying any more - the cost to lifespan ratio just is n't working for me .	-1
This is a very misleading offer from a company that probably invested way too much VC money in a failed scheme and is now desperately trying to maintain a business that does not deserve to exist.For the typical user ( someone who mails a few things a week ) there is nothing you can do with this $ 18 a month software that can not be done for FREE online with USPS , UPS , or FedEx.The Bait & Switch of this offer : When you look at the description of this product , you are thinking that you get a $ 45 postage credit , right ? WRONG ! You actually get $ 5 , but that is NOT made clear until AFTER you have signed up and supplied a valid credit card number . Then guess what - there is no easy way to cancel your account once you figure out what a questionable product this is ! Yes , that 's right folks - you have to CALL their `` customer service center '' which is only open Monday - Friday during normal business hours . I do n't know about you , but during that time , I 'm BUSY WORKING and do n't want to spend an hour on hold waiting for someone who barely speaks English to make it difficult for me to cancel my account.I was going to post a review about feature/functionality , because I did install the software and use it , taking a lot of notes in the process . However , it would be a waste of your time ( and mine ) to bother , since the service itself is such a poor value . If you are a business that requires a large volume of mailing , then get a postage meter and dispense with the hassles of this lightweight desktop product . If you are like me ( a small home-based business ) , it is far more economical to just use the various FREE online options for printing labels . For a few bucks you can buy postage labels directly from USPS ( for less than what Stamps.com charges , btw ) .This service just does n't make sense.Still considering it ? OK , here 's a couple of specific complaints/comments about the software : * Windows only - no Mac version ( this is not made clear in the item description ) * Clunky install wizard reminiscent of Windows 95 has me very worried about how hard it will be to uninstall this software ... * Once you type in your `` promo code '' ( the one that is supposed to give you $ 45 per the item description ) , there is no indication that it has `` taken '' . I realize now that this is intentional - they know that if they show you are only getting $ 5 , you will cancel before you have gotten to the next important step ( for them ) - handing them your credit card number ! * The marketing `` opt-in '' check boxes are small , hidden , and default to `` opt-in '' * If you want to print labels , you have to supply the serial number off the individual label page . Huh ? ? ! ! ! Ah , of course - they want to make sure you only buy labels from them ! * As mentioned earlier , once you supply your credit card number , there is no way to remove it or cancel your account on line . You have to call a number during `` regular business hours '' Bottom line , it appears that Stamps.com is so desperate for customers that they are resorting to bait-and-switch tactics and very misleading business practices . Furthermore , the product is of questionable value in an environment where several superior FREE options exist . [ UPDATE 2/8/10 ] I called today to cancel the service . I was told to hang up and call another number , which I did . I waited on hold for about 6 minutes at the second number , and then spoke with someone who was obviously well trained on selling rather than customer `` service '' . She was professional and cordial , but moderately aggressive about overcoming my objections to the service ( extending the free trial , changing to a lower priced plan , etc ) . Once I mentioned that I was using a Mac , she gave up quickly and processed my cancellation . I then uninstalled the software from my Windows PC . The cancellation process seemed relatively painless ( hopefully it will actually take effect ) and took about 15 minutes of my time .	-1
I 'm going along with the many other reviewers out there who feel a little confused & misled by this product name . You do n't get $ 45 in postage without signing up for paid subscription services , and the benefits do n't really ever kick in for the casual postal customer.In order to enjoy real savings ( in both time & money ) from this kit , you 'll need to be the type of person who sends out letters and parcels frequently -- small business owner , online storefront , secretary ( ? ) , etc.As for me , I think I 'll stick with using the post office . A paper slip asking me to sign up for some online services is n't really what I 'd consider a worthy buy .	-1
I wo n't restate other reviewers but add that I also found nothing in my package to order a scale and only one postcard offering $ 10 credit . I uploaded a photo to show package contents.I wanted this to work as I have to make weekly trips to the post office to have packages weighed for mailing . Even if my mailing costs exceed the $ 10 credit , I 'll still be paying an additional $ 8 a month for the privilege of printing my postage at home.I 'll save $ 100 a year and a lot of hassle by just taking my packages to the post office.You can mail any package from home weighing less than 13 oz . using regular stamps . You can get all the details at the USPS website ( search for first class mail prices ) but here are some of the costs:7oz $ 2.248oz $ 2.419oz $ 2.5810oz $ 2.7511oz $ 2.9212oz $ 3.09	-1
When I first received this kit , I was impressed by all the different types of Avery labels included and really looked forward to trying everything out with the free $ 45 in postage it advertised . I created my account , entered my promo code , and could n't figure out why I only had a $ 5 credit . Then I read the fine print on the packaging that is n't included in the Amazon information and found that I get the additional $ 40 after 30 days . Unfortunately , at the 30 day mark , they are going to bill me the $ 17.99 monthly fee too . So , I 'll use my $ 5 and cancel the account . There is no reason for me to pay $ 18 a month for the same service I can get for free through Paypal or USPS.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because the included labels are very nice . I hope Amazon revises this item to include the critical information about only getting a $ 5 credit upfront and having to pay a $ 17.99 fee to get the next $ 40.Edited : It got even worse . I tried to print the 11 stamps I could print with the $ 5 in free postage and the software ca n't find my wireless printer ( even though every other piece of software on my computer finds it just fine ) . I attempted to print to what they chose as default and , of course , it did n't print . So , I tried to get the money back and the link to request a refund , conveniently , does n't work . I went to call customer service to cancel , and they are only open Monday - Friday . So , now I have to wait until Monday and deal with them while I 'm at work . Because of this , I had to take away a star . I would take away two , but I 'm already at the lowest rating.I also read through the fine print again ( and after reading other reviews ) and saw that the kit should come with four postcards for $ 10 in free postage . You can only use one $ 10 credit per month , but that would n't matter for me anyway because my kit only came with one postcard .	-1
I am a nice reviewer . As I 've grown accustomed to Amazon 's reviews and descriptions , it 's really rare for me to buy something ( or select something ) that I do n't already know I will really enjoy.It 's going to take a lot for me to say something deserves only one star.This deserves zero stars.There are several reasons . One is that it immeadiately demanded a credit card number before I tried out the product . Even if I just want to look at the software , see how it handles mail merges or label printing or whatever , I have to give it a credit card or it just plain does n't work at all . The CD came with a `` promo code '' that did not work when I entered it in . Not that it mattered , because this offer appears to be the default , code or not.It 's pretty hard to use this unless you know exactly how much your product weighs . That 's how it works with postage most of the time , of course . The scale requires you to pay and wait , it 's only 5 pounds , and I just do n't think it makes sense to eat up some of my trial period waiting for a scale I need . This 'starter kit ' really should have included that . I would have been willing to pay ten bucks for the kit with the scale . Of course , they are claiming the scale is free instead of simply charging you upfront.The free postage rebate is far outweighed in fees . You get ten dollars back , but you have to follow a very silly postcard per month process while paying $ 18 . I hate these sorts of slow rebates with needless hassle and paperwork . by the time you get $ 40 , you have spent $ 72 on fees . WORSE , you have spent 5 months at least . And you spent more if you got the scale you really must get to make good use of this.So really , you 're paying $ 8 a month for the first few months , for a product that is n't much better than the USPS shipping label printer . And that 's if you manage the hassle of the 'free ' postage postcards for four months . All in all , the claim `` includes $ 45 in postage '' is simply a lie . It comes with $ 5 postage . That 's all . To get more , you have to pay them more than you get back.I do n't mind paying for this product . A system that manages my postage would be a big help . I sell things online and could use it . Just be straight with me . Do n't make me jump through hoops . If they had discounted the fee for the first few months , instead of this stupid plan , included a scale in the kit , this would have saved Avery customers needless hassle.The software is up to the task , the labels are very good ( I like the 3 in one labels which print your postage , return address , and 'to ' address ) , but it 's nothing amazing , and the value of the product is actually negative . It 's a great concept , but every single step is a surprise that feels like I just lost the gimmick lottery.It was much easier , even after I installed this sucker and dug through my wallet for my Visa card , to just drive on down to the post office and let Patty determine my shipping charges .	-1
I do n't see why anyone would buy this product.You only get $ 5 instead of $ 45 like the package states unless you sign-up for [ ... ] and give them your credit card information.Upon googling about [ ... ] . they have terrible customer service and bill peoples credit cards erroneously .Basically you are just getting highly overpriced labels , and software that took a tole on my computer . It took me almost a whole day to repair my computer and software back the way it was before I put this on it.Unless you are looking to spend money on absolutely nothing in gain and/or looking to destroy a computer ... BEWARE - STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE ! ! !	-1
This `` starter kit '' is really just a bunch of labels and the fabulous opportunity to get ripped off with a monthly subscription to a service you do n't need . The descriptor is very misleading and does n't include $ 45 worth of postage ( just $ 5 ) and you have to register for Stamps.com and give them your credit card to activate your benefits . Then you have to remember to cancel on time , or they 'll charge you $ 18 per month to do exactly what you can do on [ ... ] , Paypal , or eBay . Maybe this was useful before the major sites got the capability to print postage , but now it 's obsolete and feels like very `` slick '' marketing .	-1
Despite the fact that the description says it `` Includes $ 45 in Postage '' you really only get $ 5 in free postage that you must use during the 30 day introductory period . After that , you must subscribe to an $ 18/month service , after which you will receive the other $ 40 in free postage. $ 18/month requires you to use a lot of postage to make this even remotely worthwhile . Most of this stuff can easily be done over the internet and using Word and labels.The included labels are fine and the software has a nice interface . It did n't seem to do any damage to my computer.I can not recommend this because it is misleading , requires subscription to an overpriced service , and I think that if you go to the offer through the Stamp website , you get a much better offer .	-1
Maybe useful for home business purpose but not for normal home where you send seasonal cards and payment checks only .	-1
I really like the Avery line of products and I 've been a loyal customer for years . This , however , is not a product that inspires confidence . The labels are great - the same Avery quality that I 've come to expect - but the `` free '' postage is n't free and only comes after buying a few months ' worth of membership at Stamps.com ( currently $ 15.99/month ) .The kit also includes instructions to order a free postal scale . I 've tried to order but the scale has never arrived ( this is after several months ) .I actually do n't mind going to the post office and find it very convenient and quick , but I do n't mind trying out something new that might save me even more time . I sell a lot of books and thought that an online postage service would be handy , but this just has n't worked out for me . I like that I can print out Media Mail postage ( some online services do n't provide that service ) , but I also make a lot of international shipments and I still have to go to the post office for those . All in all , this kit has n't saved me any time , and that is the number one reason I wanted to try it.Perhaps if someone mails numerous packages each week this is a worthwhile membership , but it does n't fit my needs . I do n't like that the package promises one thing but the many lines of fine print actually point to something different . I 'm not surprised that `` free '' does n't mean free , but more transparency in the actual offer would be appreciated .	-1
I do occasional selling on eBay and Amazon , so I jumped at the chance to review this for the Amazon Vines program . I 'm so , so glad I did n't actually pay for it . `` $ 45 in postage* '' the description promises . ( * $ 5 immediately , and $ 40 after 30 days ) . `` Four weeks of service included* '' ( *and $ 17.99/month afterward , which is almost half of that $ 40 in postage they promised [ 28 & lt ; 30 . Do the math ] ) '' Free postage scale* ( *just pay shipping and handling ) '' Free delivery confirmation with Priority Mail services '' ( something that is available through the USPS website to anyone using Priority Mail ) .And so on.What 's actually in the package is a bunch of mailing labels and a CD . You do get some mailing management software , but , unless you do mass shipping , it 's not clear it 's that much better than the interface eBay and Paypal already provide . If you jump through a bunch of hoops , and pay an exorbitant monthly fee , you 'll get some value back in postage . Not worth it	-1
I Like the idea and I often use Avery for Templates but the cost too high . I use [ ... ] and am happy with that.All the best , RL MilesChicago Book Closeoutschicagobookcloseouts @ gmail.com	-1
Avery has joined forces with stamps.com to offer this `` starter kit '' for print-at-home postage , and while the box makes big , great-sounding promises : `` Four Free Weeks of Service ! '' and `` $ 45 Free Postage '' ... the fine print reveals some major drawbacks.First , the `` free '' postage . Actually , it 's only $ 5 , not $ 45 , unless you subscribe to stamps.com $ 15.99/month service . And even then it 's not $ 40 , it 's $ 10 per month via four separate coupons ( my kit had only one ) , redeemable only via a mail and requiring an ADDITIONAL `` 6-8 weeks '' of waiting , FOR EACH . Oh and the postcard must be mailed using an Avery stamp and stamps.com postage , notch . Oh and , that `` four weeks '' of free service ? It 's actually 14 days . When you sign up , they state clearly they 'll charge your credit card for a month 's service if you do n't call and cancel , `` within 14 days . `` The ( ridiculously high , in my opinion ) monthly service fee is prohibitive unless you 're mailing upwards of $ 200- $ 400/month on a regular basis , so that leaves most home users out . Since the postage MUST be printed on stamps.com approved labels , that 's another continuing and significant expense , above and beyond the $ 15.99 monthly fee and postage costs . I also read complaints from people online that cancellation is very difficult ( you have to call and get the hard sell from operators ) and can not be done online , leaving some with endless auto debits ( the only method stamps.com allows for payment ) , even when they 're not using the service.All you 're actually getting with this kit is 5 pages of self-stick , printable mailing labels ( 10 total ) , 4 pages of `` 3-part mailing labels pages '' and 5 stamp pages ( 20 stamps per page ) .In short , this is NOT something useful to most people who use USPS simply to send cards , pay bills and mail the occasional package . Unless you 're currently making daily runs to the post office and sending 10-20 packages per week , stamps.com service likely wo n't pay off for you . And if you DO need this service -- high volume eBay or Amazon Marketplace sellers , for instance -- stamps.com own trial offer ( which comes with the same label/stamp printing kit ) , postage credits , PLUS a 10 lb . USB postage scale that automatically integrates with their system and makes the whole thing MUCH easier to use , is probably a better deal.Again , and only in the fine print , Avery acknowledges a postage scale is required to fully utilize the stamps.com service . The Avery kit claims you can get a 5 lb . postage scale ( that does NOT hook up to your computer or integrate with the stamps.com software ) by submitting a mail-in form and , `` just pay [ ing ] shipping and handling . '' My kit lacked said form but I have a sneaking suspicion that `` shipping and handling '' would exceed the cost of the scale in the first place . ( You can buy a basic 5 lb . postage scale for > $ 15 at most office supply stores . ) Lastly , the Avery/stamps.com system will only work with Windows PCs . Max and Linux users are out of luck . In fact , the packaging says it only works with Vista , but Windows 7 machines seem to access everything OK too . ( Stamps.com entire site only works with Windows running Internet Explorer , making it a web dinosaur . Some areas wo n't function under Firefox or other browsers . Who under the age of 65 uses IE ? ) If you do use lots of postage , stamps.com might be a good deal -- for instance , you get electronic rate discounts on larger mail items and extra services -- but I think there are better ways to use/access the service than via this Avery starter kit . And if you 're only mailing things online , there are other places to print online postage , without a monthly fee , including the U.S . Postal Service 's own website.EDIT : For some reason , even though the service name and free postage amount claim are listed in the TITLE OF THIS PRODUCT , Amazon.com redacted all references in my review to the service these Avery labels require you to use for postage and the amounts of free postage promised and/or given . I do n't get that at all ( especially when such things NOT redacted in a previous review ) and I have no idea how you 're supposed to review the labels when you ca n't reference the service you must subscribe to use them and the claims made on the packaging .	-1
This is one of those products that adds to my general distrust of marketers . On the surface , it 's a pretty nice package -- software and labels that allow you to buy postage online and print it at home or at the office . I would consider the value of those items negligible , however , since the real `` benefit '' of buying this kit ( as opposed to downloading the software for free from [ ... ] ) is that you get $ 45 in `` free '' postage when you sign up for an account . Hidden in the fine print , however , is the caveat that the `` free '' postage is doled out over a period of months and you have to have a paid account with stamps.com in order to receive it . Although the sellers meet the technical requirement of disclosure , their packaging leaves a lot to be desired from a clarity standpoint . Save yourself the trouble -- if you just want to print postage at home , go to USPS and cut out he middleman ( and the hassle ) .	-1
As others have already reviewed , the marketing on this product is pretty out of control . Lots and lots of hype , and very little value delivered . At the end of the day , you 're paying $ 17.99/month for some software ( and a one-time credit of $ 40 postage . ) .As far as I can tell with brief usage , though , the software offers you nothing that you ca n't do for free on the USPS website . And from the USPS site , you can just print onto plain printer paper , with no need to purchase labels , etc.If you are an eBay seller , the Paypal shipping label printing functionality is the same as USPS , with just a faster process since the data from your transaction is already in the eBay/Paypal system .	-1
Even though it is a good product , the title is misleading since you actually get only USD 5 worth of postage - 45 on the package is only on subscription.It would probably be more easier to print labels off from post office website .	-1
There is not much to say about labels . You expect to be able to print well onto them , and have them adhere well onto packages . Unfortunately , these labels only accomplish the latter . They are promoted as accepting both ink and laser toner , but in my Brother laser printer , I tried to print both UPS and USPS labels onto them and the print quality was so terrible that I had to reprint onto plain white labels . I feared the carriers would not accept labels with degraded bar codes . It seems the printing surface of these labels is too fibrous to accept the toner well , and it even smudged a little after printing . In non-critical situations this might be fine , but not when printing bar codes . The adhesive seemed strong and durable , however.Having labels that blend in with corrugated boxes is a nice idea , but not at the expense of usability or print quality .	-1
My rating was lowered from four stars to two stars after I had to add update number 2 . Definitely pass on this one.This is a large unit . I use it in an elementary classroom . The sharpener dials to fit six different pencil sizes which is very convenient for the classroom . It has an adequate shaving recepticle and is easily emptied . ( I also use the Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp Executive in the classroom . That unit is more quiet than this one is and it is smaller . It does not handle varied sizes and that recepticle is quite small . ) The Swingline unit is very easy for the children to use and we do not have problems with jamming -- I stopped using electric sharpeners in the classroom for several years because of jamming . The swingline sharpens pencils smoothly as well.UPDATE # 1 : After using this a bit longer in the classroom I feel the need to update the review . The sharpener jams up and stops working . Sometimes leaving it idle for a short time is enough and we can then sharpen a few pencils but other times we go for days with it not working . Although this is in a classroom it does not get heavy use as we have more than shaprener in the room . It seems that the sensor for activating the sharpener is really faulty.UPDATE # 2 : this sharpener tends to implement the safety that prevents it from `` overheating '' a bit too readily . After two pencils being sharpened , it often shuts down . Although it has various openings , it also is a bit `` touchy '' about how the pencil is inserted . My original rating is 4 stars but I think I would have to reduce that to 3 stars . I find my cheaper units to be more reliable.A custodian knocked the unit onto the floor and the black plastic around the opening cracked . If the plastic is held just right it will partially sharpen still . I think it is disappointing that the motor is OK but a crack in the housing prevents us from still using this unit .	-1

This has got to be the worst printer I 've ever owned . I use multiple mifi cards at my location for internet due to lack of DSL in our area , which means that you must install the printer on EACH mifi connection . Unfortunately , since it is not a static connection , the IP address frequently changes and then the printer must be reinstalled to that particular IP address . Which means that EVERY single time you want to print something , the printer must be REINSTALLED.On top of that , no matter how many times we reconfigure or realign the printer , it does NOT print straight . the margins at the top will be .50 indented and the bottom will be .75 , so the images are skewed , the text is skewed . We 've recalibrated , run the various maintenance options , etc . From the get go this printer has been nothing short of a nightmare.It goes through ink like a sponge absorbs water and the heads frequently need cleaning to prevent massive smudging . Photos printed on photo paper have a tendency to smear before they can dry & can only be printed up to 5x7 size due to the alignment issues.The only good thing about it is the FAX , which is why I have n't thrown it out the door yet .	-1
We purchased many of these printersin 2009-2010 about 150 ) - 3 from Amazon.We do n't understand any of the 5 starreviews unless their from Epson 's pocket.Out of the 150 printers , we kept 4 for ourselves ( The restwere for resellers ) .Of the 4 printers - all 4 have been troublesome.1 went dead ( No power ) after just 2months , other one went with blinking lights '' internal error '' - and it will not functionwhat-so-ever . Of The remaining 2 : One isstill functioning but hassles us with `` printcartridges not recognized '' ( with the original ink cartridges thatcame with the printer ) . This printer failsover day or so - we partially resolvedthe problem by pulling the power cord fromthe wall and re-starting this cumbersome printer.Finally , the final 4th printer ( after workingfine for 4 months ) is blinking the same errormessage that the previous printer did.This monster has bad quality control issues.The paper tray is horribly designed and sitsfar to close to the receiving paper tray thatis so flimsy , it broke off on two of our printers.Paper jams are frequent on these printers , andcan only print on thin papers . Sometimes , itpicks up 4 or 5 sheets at a time ( 20 pound paper ) especially when printing jobs with multiple paperrequirements . The printer needs a baby sitterif you send a print job consisting of more than 1 page.The CD Tray is way too flimsy . Seems like it canbend or break very easily - very poorlymade and just bad quality for such a price to pay.Internet SpyingWhen we proceeded to printing a job over 3 documents , our firewall sent us a message ( before printing ) '' EEventManager Application is trying to access the internet '' When we looked it up it said `` Seiko Epson '' . Now , when pressed '' print '' why did it want to access the Internet ? Umm ... Well , we blocked it , because we DO Know that Epson `` updates '' your printer 's software to block you from using 3rd partycartridges.So to Epson : Why do you want to connect to our computerswhen printing a simple document ? 710 CartridgesThe 710 ink cartridges seem to last a bit longer , but the printer spends much of the time'cleaning ' the heads , that a good portionof the ink ( at least 7 per cent ) of the cartridgeis wasted during its cleaning cycle.The cycle seems to occur to every timeyou turn on the printer - so wekept on most of the time ( or sleep ) ..so the cycle would not repeat sooften . One amazon review also noted thatthe internal counter is ticking away everytimethe printer saturates the ink pads - somethingEpson never tells it customers that this printerwill completely shut down after the pads aredone ( the reset software may not work ) , leavingyou without a scanner - because once the printershuts down - so does the scanner ( we had thischecked and it has been verified by technicians ) .Also on this last 710 we have , the scanner keptscanning everytime we would turn on the computer -automatically - scanning nothing . Weird.These printers are extremely noisy onstart up to print . The snaps , crackles , and pops it makes before printing ( sometimesfor a good 2 minutes ) is enough to make thehair stand up on you thinking if this printeris commiting suicide . They are fairly quietwhile printing , though.Summary : We can not recommend this printer.The paper jams are far to frequent along withits terrible cheap paper tray . Our employeesdespise this model simply because it hasruined gobs of clean white paper by jammingand swallowing up 2 to 5 sheets at a time.Daniel James Tyler ( WJ Group )	-1
Do n't be fooled by the advertising that claims this is a 48-bit ( 16/channel ) scanner . The files produced by their scanning software will be downgraded to 24-bit ( 8/channel ) before being given to you . I bought this unit from somewhere other than Amazon , but am posting this review as a public service.I submitted this exact problem to Epson 's support : `` Using the latest version of the scan software ( Epson Scan 3.76US ) in 'Professional Mode ' I do not get a 48-bit color scan option . Under 'Image Type ' I get '24-bit Color ' only . How do I scan at the advertised 48-bit color depth level ? `` EPSON 'S RESPONSE ( four-day turnaround , fyi ) '' Thank you for contacting Epson regarding your Epson Artisan 810 . The specification of the scanner can support 48 bit ( input ) and 24 ( output only ) . That is why on Epson Scan you only have 24 bit option . `` MY COMMENTSI 'm not given to hyperbole , but this is downright fraudulent on the part of Epson - nowhere in any of their marketing or support documentation for this product do they reveal the scanner has a lower `` output '' than `` input '' bit depth . And to add insult to injury I can see right in their scanning software that 48-bit is supported on at least some of their products , but in my case the 48-bit option was grayed out . ( And until now I was completely ignorant of the difference - do a Google search for `` scanner input versus output depth '' ) . My recently deceased Canon MP760 all-in-one scanner would output 48-bit ( i.e . 16/channel ) color depth , and my Photoshop CS2 software handled it just fine . It never occurred to me that a more-expensive and three-year-newer printer would not do the same . You have been warned .	-1
This device does a nice job of printing in both B & W and color . Unfortunately the scanner shot craps just out of warranty , producing an inch-wide black stripe down side of any scanned or copied document . Even more unfortunately the failure occurred just out of warranty and Epson was no help . I 've previously had good experiences with Epsons , but based on this I 'm reluctant to recommend this one .	-1
I ordered 1 set . The first was not recognized by my ip4700 printer even after many tries as a functioning cartridge or would read empty . I emailed Vivamart and they promptly sent out another set . I was able to occasionally make the 2nd one work intermittently but neither are now recognized by my printer after printing less than 5 pages . These apparently are not really compatible . I am not fond of the ip4700 printer in any way . It is cantankerous , slow , and hangs up my computer . All my previous Canon printers were much better than this . And almost anyone 's cartridges worked just fine .	-1
[ I have a new printer -- a Canon MP640 -- and , ruefully , I forgot to follow my own advice . In 20 years of using non-OEM cartridges ( i.e . `` clones '' ) , I 've never experienced anything as bad as these PGI-220 black-ink splatterers . First , the cartridge began dripping on papers all over my desk , narrowly missing my white shirt . Then , since it was my last cartridge , I tried to install it . It did n't even `` seat , '' or click , in its compartment -- instead , it sort of balanced and teetered in the middle of the other cartridges . Lesson : even if you ca n't afford genuine Canon cartridges , spend a couple more bucks for a potentially better clone cartridge . Notice that these have an all-black label . The one that preceded it fit my machine and printed good copy -- without emptying out in a couple of days . It had an all-white label . It 's a game of exclusion , and I 'll save you the trouble of ordering the pictured cartidges . } [ As I mentioned earlier , these will NOT fit the Canon Pixma MP610 . Since writing the review , my newest gripes against the cartridge consist of : 1. constantly oscillating prices , with increases hidden in the postage of what formerly was a Prime order ; 2. the lickety-split , rapid exhaustion of the cartridge during even moderate use . I always order a new cartridge at the moment I insert my last one in my Canon 560 . Not fast enough for these 220 black clones . They 've run dry on me in a matter of 2-3 days , leaving me without a printer for the long week-end . ] In its personalized box , Amazon assures me that this cartridge will fit my old , previous printer , the Canon MP610 . Wrong , wrong , and by the 3rd time I KNEW Amazon was wrong . The cartridge indeed will fit the Canon MP560 and the Canon MP620 , among others . It will NOT work with a Canon MP610.Right fit or not , prepare yourself for the unpredictable when ordering a deeply discounted clone cartridge . For the most part , I 've had good luck since , not all that long ago , non-oem cartridges for the aforementioned two printers finally became available . However , these PGI-220BK impostors ( the thicker of the 2 black cartridges in the Canon system ) were less successful . The first required so much priming ( deep cleaning ) that by the time it agreed to perform it had divested itself of half its contents . The 2nd behaved in an opposite manner -- far from suffering from constipation it liberally drained a small pool of its contents on my newly pressed shirt before I had a chance to put it in its place.If your luck is better than mine , be grateful ; if it 's worse , give it another shot . There are numerous dealers , and even with the same dealer a supply of cartridges can vary considerably from one batch to the next . If , after spending ten bucks , you 're still batting a dismal .200 , you might look for some different configurations ( the 4 and 5 cartridge sets tend to be more consistent than the solo and duo packages ) and consider setting your sights a bit higher ( i.e . spending a bit more for a clone that 's been made to feel like less of an orphan or black sheep ) . When all else fails , prepare to suck it up and go for the killer cartridge , the Black Widow / Black Swan 1-2 punch of genuine , OEM Canon cartridges.Final consolation : I find that that spending more on better or , in some instances , premium cartridges `` forces '' me to print fewer gratuitous downloads ( which I rarely read ) , saves the world a few more trees , and finally encourages a more prudent and resourceful use of personal time while at the darned machine .	-1
The labels are advertised as being permanent . It does n't say what surfaces they are permanent on . I printed a sheet on my laser printer to use for labeling some products . The first application was to a largePelican 1614 Watertight Hard Case with Dividers & Wheels - Black . Stuck the label on , and tried removing 48 hours later , could peel it off just as easily as when I put it on.Next up were someFujiFilm FinePix A230 12mp Digital Camera - Redwhich I give out for wedding clients to put on tables for guests . Again , the labels peeled off just as easily as when they were applied some 48 hours earlier.Beyond the easy removal of the permanent label , the printing wiped off of the labels easily.The template however worked great !	-1
These things stick to all the surfaces Post-its traditional do well on - paper and . . . well , paper , pretty much , which means that this product is only useful if you frequently relabel your file folders . Rather frequently , too , because the glue on these tends to be less than `` Super Sticky . `` I got these thinking they 'd be a handy way to label leftovers in the fridge or the bottles of unlabelled spices I keep in the cupboard , but they were n't up to either task . These might be useful for an office setting or something , and they do have the advantage of having glue on the whole surface of the label .	-1
With Christmas in full swing at my house , I looked to these new post-it labels to help me label all of my storage totes . I have a dozen or so rubbermaid containers that have previously resisted labeling . Other than clear packing tape ( with printed notes underneath ) , no label solution that I 've tried has worked . Generally , the label will peel off after a month or two.Since it is n't yet time to pack up for Christmas , I made four `` test '' labels using my new post-it `` super sticky '' labels and attached them to four different rubbermaid containers . Unfortunately , within 24 hours , three out of four of these labels had curled and fallen off of the rubbermaid and were sitting on my garage floor . They clearly do not work at all with rubbermaid totes which is all that I own . That alone would probably earn a 3-star review but I find the slender non-sticky area that is meant to help you peel off a new sticker to be very hard to manipulate . My big hands had to fight to isolate a single sticky note to peel off.While I LOVE post-it notes and consider them to be the best office product of all time , I can not recommend this product .	-1
I could n't get the labels apart , the entire back is sticky and there 's suppose to be a line that is n't so you can easily separate the labels . Mine apparently either did n't have this non-sticky area or the black line did n't line up because I had to get a razor blade to separate the labels . In addition , I used on my totes in the barn to label a few Christmas items and within days they had fallen off . Also , I used in the refrigerator , they stuck to the glass jars but did not stick to my tupperware plastic . Again , within days they curled and fell off . Not a very reliable product yet , needs some more fine tuning .	-1
These label pads are like post it notes but with the whole back being sticky.So , the trick is , how do you get one label off the pad ? The designers added a black ink dotted line , and the paper is not sticky to one side of that line , so you can pull it off there.Then if you want to get rid of the dotted black line , there is a perforated line that you can tear along . The problem is that they are not aligned , and the edge comes out looking messy.The design of these labels could be much better , as in leaving one corner without stick , and a dot on the back side so you could tell which corner it was.With the design as it is , your fingers smudge the sticky back as you try to get the perforated section off .	-1
I would give this 5 stars for great adhesive and removability but the little tear off piece is terrible . The perforation is useless leaving a jagged ugly edge . I understand why they tried to market it this way since people are use to the pad form of Post-it products but these would have been much more user friendly had they left them as individual wax paper backed labels and sold them in the same zip lock storage pouch they already came in.I much prefer their product called Color-Coding Labels sold in an 8.5x11 sheet size format with waxed paper backing for easy removable labels . There are 4 colors rather then just two and they have clean rounded edges for a much nicer finished look . They can be printed on with your printer ( the package I received was for laser , not sure they make them for inkjet ? ) but they are nice to hand write on as well and they are smaller labels 1 '' x2-5/8 '' so they are great on file folders as well as other applications . They need to work on the above product some more I would not recommend them as they are now .	-1
I tried these and the glue is too sticky . When I tried to remove them , they torn the pages in my book . : (	-1
I primarily wanted these to label yearly collections of income tax files in a filing drawer . I wanted the bold year to stand out on the bright label and these bright colors worked great for that purpose . They printed out very crisp and clean , no smudging , which was a good start . I thought the fact they were removable would be a useful thing , but it proved to be annoying trying to get the label to stay where I wanted it on the folders once they were positioned where they were to stay . Before a month 's time in the storage file drawer , and without even much handling , the labels had begun to curl at the topmost edge , eventually looking ragged and sloppy . I will have to return to my non-removable labels and let the kids play with this set . Sorry , Post-It , I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
What a neat idea . 3M has always been on the cutting edge of creative organization . I liked the idea of getting another option to organize my files and boxes . As promised , these labels are easy to work with and easy to remove without any residual residue . There are 4 color options of Pink , Blue , Yellow and Green and the palette though pastel is not so light colored that they are n't noticeable . You can print your labels using either laser or inkjet printer -I have laser . The label was crisp in the lettering . They are very versatile , you could use this to label binders , folders , inventory and even storage containers . They are also the right size to use as ID badges at an event , since they are color coded you could use one color for sales staff , another for accounting , another for information systems and so on.The only drawback I observed occurred when I placed it inside my personal diary ( I do n't have a blackberry ) part of the edge covered the opposite page covering the crease . When I opened it up , the page that had the label 's edge portion had the 2 '' edge peeling away from the page . In an instance , where it might be to large to fit one surface say on a smaller binder ( the labels are 2x4 ) , I could see where it may pull off since it is so easily removed . The options would be to cut the label down so that it lies on the flat surface and to try to avoid corners , if the edge of the label does n't go very far beyond the corner . For instance , if you had it on a box edge where you wanted one label to cover two sides it may be best to place the label 's center on the edge , so that both sides are equally covered . Or another solution might be to cut the label in half to and place it on two sides to avoid the corner altogether or just use two labels.This issue alone does n't seem a reason not to buy this product ; I would definitely use it in my home and office. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Update 4/12/12I hope 3M improves these labels , they do not stick well . I would use a Post It , before I use these further . They fall off and then you do n't know which box it belongs to because there are multiple labels on your floor ! I started taping them on , which was exactly what I did n't want to do . However , at the time I had no other label on hand , I had to keep my records organized.I gave them a revised 2 stars because of the colors are different than what other competitors are using .	-1
I was unimpressed with this product . The labels are certainly removable but they are not sticky enough . They do not adhere all that well with the first placement , let alone repositioning them elsewhere . If you only want labels for a very temporary job and do n't plan on reusing them , these would be a satisfactory choice . I used them on file folders and regular paper . Their impact on file folders was poor and on regular paper they were only OK .	-1
Pros : They are bright and come in assorted colors for easy color coding of filesThey run very well through the printer and come out cleanCons : They do n't re-stick once they are peeled offThey come off in one piece , but leave a sticky residue on the file/folderThey are more pricey than regular stickies with no added benefitsYou ca n't cleanly write on them instead of putting them in the printerOverall , Do n't waste your money on these . They essentially do the same thing that regular , store brand labels do . The only exception is that they come in neat colors . I found that printing on them works well , but where they fall short is the peeling and re=sticking . They come off , but leave a mark and then are not truly sticky enough to reapply and leave for a long period of time , which is the feature that I thought would make these labels worth paying the extra money for . Also , I liked the idea of being able to color code files , these work great for that , but the fun colors alone are n't worth paying the extra cost . I have found that I can use regular labels and print the letters themselves in color-which allows me to use the cheaper labels , but still have a color coded system that works just as well at a fraction of the cost . In an economy where every penny counts , save yourself some money and pass on these over-priced , under performing labels ! !	-1
I decided to be creative and try our the neon colored laser labels , but looking at them it still smacked me in the face , screaming `` unprofessional '' , and too chaotic to help me organize items . The labels themselves are great , the colors are just not for me . The standard white labels are fantastic and these are easy to use , and if your preference is for bold colors then this product is for you , it 's just not something I prefer .	-1
I run 2 at home businesses and create person media often . In the last 4 years , I 've tried many brands and have come to depend on Avery brand labels . Avery uses high quality paper with strong adhesives that work well with home printers.When I found these 3M labels , I decided to give them a try . Immediately , I noticed that the paper was much thinner than Avery . So thin that the `` 3M '' logo printed on the back of the non-sticky paper was clearly visible through the sticky labels . Since I often cover up other text with white labels , labels this thin are very disappointing.The glue on these 3M labels works great . 3M is well-known for their adhesives . These labels are no exception.Recently , Avery has released labels in which the paper is perforated to easily fold back , exposing the ends of the sticky labels . This makes peeling off label exceptionally easy . 3M tried a similar tactic with these address labels , however only got it half right . 3M labels have a borderless side that makes the label edge visible , however the lack of perforations makes removing a 3M label as difficult as traditional stamped label types . Because the paper at the borderless edge is so thin and flimsy , it is very difficult to get the label edge to pop off the paper . Surprisingly , the label side with the border is much easier to peel off than the borderless side.After testing 3M labels , I am even more confident in the Avery brand .	-1
These labels were easy to find a setting to use in Word to print them , but the labels themselves were out of alignment with that setting . I put the label sheet in correctly and made sure it was lined up in my printer , but over a 1/3rd of the labels printed off the sheet , making many of them unusable . I would probably go with a different product for printing address labels . I tried several times but of no use . To be fair , there were 80 labels per sheet and were easy to lift from the sheets , but I was n't happy with wasted labels after printing .	-1
It feels thin and cheap . Using it over existing text does not cover the existing text . You can still see the text underneath . Otherwise , nothing special .	-1
These are labels designed to be used in laser and inkjet printers . Their size , inch by 1 and inches , makes them appropriate for small return mailing labels , small object labels , and so on.I will say outright that I did not try them in my printer . The layout of the labels seemed quite odd to me after having used printer labels for quite some time . The label columns were separated vertically by open spaces of the waxed-paper like backing , which seemed to me would drastically increase the chances of jamming the printer . The labels seemed more likely to peel off easily in the printing process , and I was unwilling to risk wasting my time on a printer jam.The paper surface of the labels seems okay , and held writing in ink and permanent marker as well as any such label I have used.These are not labels which I will use again . I think there are just too many flaws .	-1
I ordered these because I wanted to have stick on return address labels . Maybe I misread the dimensions I am not sure . But they are so small I ca n't see how they could be used as address labels , return or otherwise . They are even too tiny to use as file folder labels . I can not even imagine what circumstances there would be a demand for them -- except to type a code number.Obviously , they were not meant for someone like me , a regular consumer . I assume some business could use them in some format -- but I doubt the post office could even read the tiny print that would have to go on them for a 3 or even 2 line address.Take that for what you will . I am not even sure this qualifies as a review of the product itself . Perhaps someone has an idea under what circumstance someone could use 1/2 inch high return address label .	-1
I 'd had high hopes to save time by printing up a batch of these return address labels . Unfortunately , due to two problems , they 're unsuitable for such use:1 . The label size is not among the predefined sizes used in MS Office Word 2007 , so I went to 3M 's website in search of a template . Even that did n't work correctly . Though it appeared formatted perfectly on my computer the print overlapped the left margin by 2 letters on every single column . Repeated efforts to fix this were n't successful.2 . Also , the label height is such that you can only get 2 lines of default ( 11 pt ) size type on them . That 's enough for a street address on one line , with City , State and Zip on another . In other words , there 's insufficient space for your name , much less an apartment or suite number.I probably could 've remedied the second problem by reducing the font to a smaller size but then it would be so small some people might find it unreadable . The first problem could n't be corrected at all , unfortunately .	-1
I thought the address you type into the space is supposed to fit automatically into the label when you choose the correct label number . It says to use Avery label code 5167 . I did so . When I printed a page of labels the address did n't come close to fitting properly . I had to mickey around with the font . What 's the point of having template codes if you have to fool around with the font anyway ? Also , the labels are too small . The poor postman would need a magnifying glass !	-1
I thought I 'd give these some time before posting a review , to see how well they held up . They do n't . I loved the idea of being able to move the labels on the plastic drawers I use for organizing everything I like to tuck away in cabinets , from office supplies to toiletries . But , less than a month after putting these in place , the labels were falling off every time I turned around . I found one that had made its way , somehow , from my home office out to reappear in my car . And , another one turned up on my cat 's foot ! A couple labels that I tested on manila folders did work better , and seem still to be in place for now . That 's not what I wanted to do with these , though , and the ones I tested on a wood shelf did n't fare any better than the ones I used on plastic . I 'm giving up on the nifty idea of re-stickable labels on my plastic drawers and boxes , and plastering these in place with a strip of packing tape each . And , I 'm not impressed . It 's a great idea , but it needs to go back to the drawing board !	-1
Everyone loves Post-Its , but these labels are only marginally adequate.PROS : - You can print on them and they will stick to some things , like paper.CONS : - They are 3 7/16 '' long , which is too large for many folders.- The Post-It template for the labels is poor , though an Avery equivalent is available.- If you use the labels on anything but a folder-like surface , the adhesive is weak and the labels tend to curl.If you have a specific need for labels this size and plan to use them only as intended , on folders , then they 're fine . Otherwise there are many superior options .	-1
I bought several of these to hold doors open while moving from one apartment to another . They are realy light , too light to hold a heavy door . They are also prone to breaking or bending rather than holding doors in place if you do manage to get them to stay put . I ended up needing to wedge several of these together under an exterior door to keep it open .	-1
i hate having to open n close doors to go from room to room in my own house when i am the only one at home so i thought these might be able to help ... seems i was wrong ! ! no matter how far i push 'em under the doors they just skate right across the floor with the least amount of breeze ... two different rooms ... two different tiles ( non-skid-might i add ) ... maybe it has to do with the smooth finish in the bottom ... either way ... i wont recommend these for wooden or tiled floors ...	-1
This thing looks like half of a golf ball on my wall , it also does n't do much for stopping the door either . By its description it seems like it is soft and full of air . Its a hollow half circle with a sticker pad on the back . Have n't decided if it is even worth the return effort	-1
You get a 36x24 '' thin sheet of melamine resin surrounded by a VERY thin aluminum frame with a little tray to hold your markers and eraser on the bottom side . The frame is so thin , the entire structure warps and wobbles it you attempt to actually write on the board or erase while on an easel . You need to dedicate one hand to hold the board when using it.If mounted on a wall - and it comes with instructions , template and the needed 2 screws and 3 ( one extra ) plastic wall anchors - the warping should not be an issue but that 's not how I intended to use it.I do hate this board and therefore the 'one star ' rating . If the vendor issued a warning against easel mounting it would have been a different story and I would not have spent my money on it in the first place but , warning absent , I wasted my money on something that I ca n't use as I intended .	-1
The packing was completely inadequate , the board was out of the package and broken at two corners .	-1
I must say this unit makes awesome lables ... and I bought the Brother brand as I have had excellent luck with other products by them maostly scanners and printers . The unit is a nice size ... packed well..instructions are ok and get you through . I found a couple really annoying tthis=gs though ... First off they do n't give you the power adaptor for the unit you have to use batteries ( not included ) or buy the power cord on your own ... .secondly and most annoyingly the display is hard to read if you directly over it ... .if your sitting in front of it with it on a talbe its fine ... but if say your doing a project and your standing typing in the lablels and someone else is applying them ... well now you have a problem ... its a pain . you have to tilt it away from you to see the display ... there is no adjustment on the contrast to help with this ... your just stuck . Last but not least when doing multiple labels there is no easy way to erase your last label and make a new one ... .you can eather hold down the delete key till it gets back to the start or you can shift/backspace and then selct text and ok ... yeah thats right 4 steps ... a pain ... and by the way its not in the directions either ... that was trial and error ... sorry this unit just disappoints except on the label quality ... the ease of use just is n't	-1
I bought this when it was on special at Christmas , but just got around to using it now . I popped in new batteries I bought from Amazon and they were too weak . Lousy Amazon basic batteries ! Put in more new batteries and tried again . Nothing . Opened it to find the the labels were twisted inside and they were all dried out . Boo , hiss , Amazon !	-1
When I saw this lap table I have to admit I thought it would be great for my laptop and iPad . It might be , if you could ever get it configured right . It is extremely difficult to set the legs and the sad part is that once you spend all that time to get the legs set right and use it , you have to fold the legs up to store it . So the time it took to set it was wasted . It is also kind of flimsey and bouncy . Not good for much of anything .	-1
In spite of what it says here , the manufacturer , when I called them , agreed that this can not be used if you are an Amazon seller and want to print directly from the Amazon site , even though those labels are 4x6.On top of that , even if it did , it printed a partial print out of each label ( cut in half ) and I could see that the quality was so poor that it hardly matters -- they are so faint that after it hits sunlight for a spell , like on a loading dock , it just is not well seen for the price.Add to that the fact that this is made so that when it prints out a blank page , you ca n't rewind the spool to use that blank page -- it 's ' just wasted . That is a big design flaw.I see that after I received this Amazon has put a hault on selling this item due to returns.It only makes sense to me that Amazon would create a label make of their own with so many Amazon sellers ... there is only a 50/50 shot of the Zebra working on a mac as well . Why ? Because Zebra only makes software for a PC so sellers of the Zebra thermal printer have had their own after market software made to sell to mac users . So usually you get some glitch in those . I had to return the Zebra I ordered as well because the software just did not truly work that the seller I ordered from had made.I bought this for work orders , both Amazon orders and my storefront , and it 's just not going to work , even after I hired a computer expert to fix it.I did see bad reviews on this before I bought it but it was so mixed -- and typically when you have a computer expert in your office , you figure if some are getting it to work , even if you have to pay extra to have it set up right , you 'll be fine . No go.I 'm not giving up my mac so I will stick with the slower way of labeling . Tape on paper address printouts . Until perhaps Amazon can set up their own thermal printer for Amazon sellers . I 'd buy that . If it worked with my mac ,	-1
I use many labels like these by another brand but they are not the kind you can print on . I use them on a retail product ( artwork framed and in mylar sleeves ) as price labels color coded by size . I have always had to hand write on my labels they are not inkjet able and I wanted a more professional price tag . I was hoping these would be the answer but after an hour of trying to get a template to come up I gave up . The Post-it site says the product number is not valid yet it is pictured on the website with the same template number on the package , when you click on get a template it is not there . I tried both ways to get a template that was shown on the instructions and I had no luck . So , as far as printing a professional looking price label I am very disappointed and frustrated with this product . Yes , I can still write on them as I have always done before but I 'm not sure they will stick on long term . They are not as sticky as the labels I was using and I am not sure they will stay on my mylar and glass applications for a long period of time which can make inventory a nightmare , only time will tell . I will test them for stick duration on a couple of pieces and let you know if they stay on long term . Maybe the template issue will be resolved by then .	-1
I replaced a PIXMA IP3000 which was the best printer I have used in years . I had a S450 prior which was also great . Lexmark 's and HP 's have been way too expensive on ink . The Lexmarks also had inferior print quality and reliability problems to boot . I have run almost a million pages through several printers . I lost my ip3000 in a power outage . I suspect that this triggered a circuit which could be reset or replaced . Tech support was useless . My failing eyesight has prevented me from being able to completely disassemble the old printer . The internal power supply does supply power to the printer , but nothing else works . If someone out there knows how to fix this problem let me know . I still have about 20 cartridges for this printer . I would love to have it working again.For the new ip4700 , I was disappointed by the tiny ink cartridges . I also prefer transparent ink tanks . This printer takes much longer to start printing than my precious printers . This is the slowest printer I have used in years . It took several minutes to print 4 pages of text with colored borders , then crashed my computer . It printed on reboot . On a good day even 1 page of text takes several seconds . Also , the default paper source is automatic which looks for the lower tray first and if it is empty it locks up the computer rather than looking at the rear tray which is my preferred paper source as I can see the type of paper being loaded . ADDITIONAL WARNING Do not use the driver CD : download the driver , although that is still giving my computer ( WINXP ) problems even after 2 driver upgrades . The print quality is no better than my old s450 and ip3000 , which were good . I do not normally print photos , but advertising material . I am probably going to return this printer . I am so glad I bought it through Amazon.Update : I have not returned the printer . I needed one . This printer still hangs up after a print job . I have to cancel it manually and that takes several minutes to execute . To print several jobs could take 1/2 hour . I now have found a used ip4500 ( more ink for less ) and I will sell this ip4700 printer cheap.Next update -1 month later . Still major problems - Finished print jobs will not release printer . It takes typically 1/2 hour to print 4 multiple page jobs in standard res . Constant cleaning cycles caused it to run the magenta and cyan out of ink after 2 pages color and 50 pages of text . Many non-OEM cartridges do not work properly with this printer causing lockups . I do not recommend this printer for anyone.It is now 3 months and a move later . I purchased a used Canon after my experiences with this one . I probably will not buy another new Canon . This one freezes , then will not release the print jobs and prevents any more printing without a reboot . It uses more ink in setting itself than I used in actual printing . One set of cartridges did not even last 100 pages of text and a few pictures . I do not think the non_OEM cartridges are as much a problem as is the software . I am going to purchasing a cheap laser printer for my text jobs .	-1
I have owned this printer for close to two years now and a few days ago I got a B200 error telling me to contact customer support . I did and they told me there is something wrong with the electronics of the printer or the printer head and that I need to buy a new model or repair it , but the repair will probably cost more than a new printer . I mostly use the printer for scanning and I have printed just a few times since I bought it , this is a home printer with a very light workload , connected to a surge protector , etc . That it broke down so soon means very poor quality . Ink consumption was an issue too , very , very high , but printing quality was amazing so I could live with it . Not anymore as it 's not workingThis is my first and last Canon printer I 'll ever own , this is completely unacceptable . I 'll stick to their cameras which appear to be built by professionals and not by the amateurs that build their printers . For me is back to HP , their printing quality may not be that good and their UIs are subpar , but at least they not break down after light use , all HP printers I owned in the past were donated or recycled to give way to a new product , they never failed on me like this flimsy productDid I mention Canon printers are atrocious ? O yes I did	-1
I hate writing bad reviews but some products just warrant them . I received this product along with the binding supplies and , despite going through nearly half of the binding folders , not a single sample has worked . I 've tried everything -- fewer sheets , fill the thing folders to capacity , bind on a longer setting . Nothing . Sure , the first and last sheet will stick to the folder but the center sheets simply fall out.If I need things bound in the future , I 'll be paying the few bucks for the professionals at the office supply store to do it .	-1
These stick very well to the file folders . They do tend to peel after time ( a few weeks ) . They also are difficult to write on with a simple ball point pen . I found them to be seemingly easy to use , but not as reliable as the old style slide-in tabs . They are very green because they do allow you to reuse the same folders , so in that way , they are cost effective .	-1
At first glance the Avery PocketTabs ( 5.125 x 6 inches , CD Size ) seemed like an interesting idea . A plastic tab that holds CDs , photos and more . On second glance I wondered exactly what would I do with this product.I can put CDs or photos in the plastic tabs . They fit inside nicely . Now what ? Should I paste my CDs into an album ? Should I paste them on a wall ? What can I do with these plastic tabs that I could n't do with other products ? I am sure that given enough time I 'll figure it out . Meanwhile I am still waiting for inspiration to strike . Until it does , I am afraid that these Avery PocketTabs will sit in my desk drawer doing little to nothing.The Avery PocketTabs may well be a product solution looking for a problem .	-1
I actually hurt myself trying to close the pocket up again after putting a CD in it . I gave myself a little cut , trying to force the edge of the enclosure back into the pocket . I also thought the color was a little dark for reading through . The pocket did easily stick and re-stick when I tried it in different places and positions .	-1
Avery PocketTabsare , unfortunately , a flawed product . I use a large amount of Avery products for organizing and labeling , both at work and at home . When I first got these pocket-tabs , I thought I had solved a huge need . The versatility of storing papers , cards , or disks in these pockets was exactly what I was looking for . Being able to label the tabs seemed even better . But after using these for a few months , I think that the cons outweigh the pros.PROS+ The mix of features are perfect for those who have mixed storage needs+ The 5 pack size is good for those who only need a few pockets ; many binder sheets are sold in packs of 25+ The color options allow for easier coding / classification of pockets+ The adhesive backing allows pockets to be moved ( although that also makes them adhere weakly to many surfaces ) + The colored pockets are see-through , allowing you to read notes stored inside+ The pockets close , unlike many binder sleeves made solely for CDs and DVDs+ After months of use , the plastic seams have stood up wellCONS -- The pockets are too small to include a padded sleeve to provide extra protection to CDs or DVDs -- The lack of integrated padding makes this inferior to most binder sleeves for CD or DVD storage -- The cutout used to keep the pocket closed feels easy to break and is awkward to slip open and closed -- The tabs can be written on once instead of being designed to work with printed Avery tab inserts ; you are out of luck if you want to change what you wrote -- The tabs can only be written on the front side ; the backside is smooth plastic ; this is impractical when they are turned -- The weight of the pocket is too heavy to be reliably attached to sheets of paper -- The adhesive backing is too weak to really hold them securely to many surfaces -- The adhesive will indeed sometimes lift paper and ink when repositioned -- The lack of holes for use in a 2 or 3 ring binder is a big missing featureOn the package , it advises that the adhesive should `` always be tested '' to ensure that it will not pull paper and ink when the pockets are moved . However , even on areas that passed this test , I found that paper and ink sometimes came up after the pockets had been adhered to one place for two long . Maybe changing temperatures made some paper weaker than others . I stopped sticking these to paper and now adhere these pockets directly to my binder covers instead . Some tape in the corners helps to keep them secure because the adhesive alone is not enough to keep them in place.Because of the weaknesses for storing CDs and DVDs , I have also devoted these to small papers . Other products that are designed for CDs and DVDs are probably best for that purpose.Caselogic CDP-200 200 Disc Capacity CD ProSleeve Pagesare great for storing CDs in 3-ring binders , but they do not close and are not an option for disks and cards . That works out to a much better value but it does require you to purchase many more ( 25 ) sleeves , with each one holding 8 disks as opposed to one . Other options are available such as theFellowes CD-ROM Loose-Leaf Binder Sheetsbut I have n't tried those yet.CONCLUSIONThis product may work for you if you just need something to store small cards or loose papers . This is not a good solution if CDs are your primary storage need.Enjoy .	-1
I obtainted this product via the Vine Program ( sample product is supplied to Vine members at no cost for evaluation ) as I thought it would provide a nice storage sleeve for either a CD/DVD or similar flat items . Based upon the description of the package , one would expect that this product could be added to some type of binder ( reference is made to being able to tab through them ) . This simply is not the case , there are no provisions in the holder to be added to any type of binder.Reference is also made to being able to open and close the sleeve easily . That is also not the case . While there is a plastic cutout that can be inserted into th sleeve , it is difficult to use without being able to flex the sleeve ( impossible to do if you have anything that take up very much of the sleeve ) .There are tabs on the top of sleeve ( they are all located in the center of the sleeve so forget about easy indexing ) so that you could place them loosely into a box . There is also a place on each sleeve where an Avery cover is placed over a sticky surface on the sleeve . The cover is NOT intended to be written upon . Instead , it appears to be there to cover up the sticky surface until you peel it away and then place a special Avery label onto the sticky surface.I have tried finding a use for this product , but have not had any luck ! It appears that this product was originally designed for a special purpose that was either scrapped or failed and that the company is looking for some way of salvaging their investments in parts.If you are looking for a CD/DVD sleeve , buy one made specifically for that purpose . If you are looking for a business card holder , there are several good ones out there specifically designed for that purpose . If you want to store pictures , again , there are very good products specifically designed for this purpose . Trying to force this product to do any of those jobs is just a waste of time and money .	-1
This packet of Avery Pocket Tabs does n't have any significant qualities that make it stand out in a crowded market that already has various CD/DVD cases for safe storage . These soft plastic cases do n't have soft pads inside to protect your CD or DVD and just a tab sticking on the top does n't make it unique . I much rather use hard plastic cases that provide protection from breakage and scratching on the surface . This is a soft case which makes it unsuitable for CD and DVD .	-1
Shame on Brother for releasing this labeler with such a pathetic battery life ! After only a couple of labels it starts complaining of LOW batteries.I opened it up and installed a DC jack , and plug in an external power supply . Then it 's great.If I had n't gotten it free with credit card points I 'd be really miffed.It 's otherwise a nice little labeler , and they could have easily tucked 4 AA 's inside instead of 4 AAA 's , which are totally inadequate for the job .	-1
Updated Review : We 've been using these in our home with light use by two of our children over the past few months . At least half of them have broken apart at the joint in such a way that they ca n't be fixed . I would never recommend these , especially in a classroom where they would get heavier use.Original Review : I really like these scissors . They 're sharp to cut with ( I ca n't stand the paper only scissors ) , but blunt so it 's safer . I love that they 're right or left handed and I love the color assortment . The size is nice too - easy for both kids and adults to use.As others have pointed out the `` stand '' is just plastic packaging and is basically false advertising . If it did n't say that it included a stand I would have given it five stars . The packaging bows in the middle so half the scissors do n't stay upright , and it 's so lightweight that it easily falls over . If it did n't say it came with a stand you would literally throw the packaging out and not think anything of it.I agree with another reviewer that the colors looked dirty somehow where they meet the secondary color , but that 's cosmetic and relatively minor.Overall they 're a solid product .	-1
Although I love the pastel colors , this item is wasteful.Unfortunately , I 'll never use the note tabs .	-1
I suppose when they said that these NoteTabs are repositionable they did n't think people might actually want them to stick to something in the first place . The ones I received did not stick very well to the surface to which I 'd tried to adhere them , staying on for less than a day before peeling partly off . They 'd be wonderfully useful if they stayed on when they should and were able to be taken off and reused , but these are not worth the purchase .	-1
I 've used several of the NoteTabs products and this , so far , is my least favorite . It is durable and well made , like the other products , but it is n't as flexible in how you use it . The opaque tab means that it really can only be used to mark the edge of the paper , but the smaller tab makes more sense for this purpose . If you want to add a note to the page it makes more sense to use the NoteTabs without the tab , since you can place that on the page anywhere.So far I have only used this one to mark a page as I work through the book . I ca n't say that it is completely useless , or anything like that . But for my purposes , it is not very useful . I do like the other NoteTabs products , though .	-1
I tried playing around with these tabs , and even tried thinking of other uses because I truly like Avery products . But this fell flat . Yes , it is durable . And yes , you can see through it . But why would you need it ? If you want to return a text book to save money , are you really going to spend extra money for plastic note tabs when you can buy several hundred paper ones for the same price ? My advice , stick with the other product .	-1
As an office supply junkie who can not seem to read a book without highlighting and adding many margin comments , the Avery note tabs seemed to be a promising product . And maybe they are ... .but I am still trying to find an application that is worth the effort . Using them requires an awkward 2 handed operation , particularly for the non-tabbed segments . Despite product information that indicates they are compatible with most writing instruments , my ultra fine Sharpies tended to smudge and ball points work best when no finger has touched the surface ~ an impossibility given the design . The top tabbed portion is has potential but there is seldom a need for the 7 '' option , nor would it be cost effective as a highlighter . Maybe I am simply too accustomed to post-its and my trusty highlighters to make the switch but try as I might , the benefits of this item have yet to be revealed . More of a marketing gimmick that either needs more work or needs to be left behind .	-1
These wide plastic tabs have a translucent writable surface to jot down a few notes . ( I recommend pencil . Pen works , but being plastic , the ink will remain wet and can come off on the opposite page . ) The concept , is that you might write down notes on a page of interest , or modifications to a recipe . But , in the case of notes , I 'd prefer recylable paper post-it notes , and in the case of a recipe , it is unlikely that the translucent surface will be where you want it . The long , sticky surface is scored and can be torn into smaller pieces for placement about the page which might take care of that issue - but they heavy thickness of the plastic makes them awkward for that . ( The score marks also allow them to be used in books with narrower pages . ) Being wide and sticky , you want to roll them down onto the page to avoid a pinched page that will wrinkle when the book is closed.A big flaw with these is that the blank tab surface is only writable on one side of the tab . This limits their usage to being all on the right ( top ) side of a book or all on the left ( bottom ) so that the writable tab surfaces all face in the same direction.I like the idea of movable book tabs , but find the small tab-only 2 '' x 1.5 '' Avery product generally more useful .	-1
These NoteTabs are the length and width of a shopping list note pad except that they have several perforated sections , are made of a clear see-through plastic-like material , and have a tab on top.Except for the tab part ( which looks like the tab on a binder divider ) , the rest of the sheet has a `` post-it type '' sticky background so that you can stick the entire length of the NoteTab to your book or item . You can also separate the perforated sections and stick them other places on the page or use them separately elsewhere.These NoteTabs appear to have a limited use . The tab is good for marking sections of a document or book that you want to get to quickly ; so it acts like a binder divider . You can also write on that tab easily with a pen or marker . However , the see-through sections should be written on with a marker because it 's hard to write on them with a pen . I found these sections to be good for highlighting over an area of a book with a highlighter . For instance , if you borrowed someone 's book and did n't want to mark it up , you could easily stick these clear sections to a portion of a page and then use your highlighter to highlight over the clear plastic . You can then remove the NoteTabs without leaving any residue and reuse them if you did n't write on them or highlight over them.Other than highlighting over sections of text or using the top portion with the tab to act like binder dividers in a book , I honestly see no useful purpose for these NoteTabs . This product is certainly not something I have use for .	-1
What the heck are you supposed to do with these ? Like another reviewer said , give us an instruction manual ! I ca n't see much use for these.Plastic post it notes ? More junk for the land fills.Writing on them takes time to dry so you ca n't turn the page until you let them dry.Really strange design . I predict these disappear from the Avery line soon .	-1
Mr. McGuire : Are you listening ? Benjamin : Yes , I am.Mr . McGuire : `` Plastics '' .Ever heard of the `` Great Pacific Garbage Patch '' ? It 's a swirling gyre of marinelitter in the central North Pacific Ocean estimated to be twice the size ofTexas . It is said that plastic makes up about 90 percent of all trash floatingin the world 's oceans . Sooner or later it seems , even the most innocent ofnon-degradable items has a pretty good chance of ending up down there , chokingmarine life and pretty well destroying the food chain.I typically love office supplies , but at first I found this product a littlepuzzling- if someone just handed me one I would probably come up with a use forit , but probably not the one for which it was intended . Here we have 3 '' X7 '' sheets of translucent plastic , thick like a cover sheet- the top has an indextab , below it three perforations separate the sheet into 2 X 3 '' rectangles.From the illustration on the package , I learn you can place these over a printedpage and make notes on it . I ca n't see a use for these in my world or work atthe moment , I seem to have discovered a bit of stationery for which I can'tjustify purchasing or using . I realize they would be intended to make a commentin a book or paper without leaving any permanent marks , but I have been usingregular sticky notes for that for years , primarily to point out passages inbooks or magazines.. I can see these would be of use if you do a lot of in-printediting , at the moment most all of my work is online and only sharedelectronically.I bet if I hang on to these I will devise another off-label use , but at themoment they go into the bottom drawer ... while this is a sturdy and well-madeproduct , at some point we have to say , `` do we really need more little pieces ofplastic in our lives ? `` So , four stars because they are of typical Avery high quality , but one star forbeing something we should live without .	-1
This is a hard review to write , but this product has a number of people in my office , including myself , baffled . I have tried other Avery Pocket Tab products - which are pockets that stick to file folders , etc , and have a tab of their own that one can write on , and think they are nifty . But this ? Not so much so.The Note Tabs are approximately 7.5 '' in length and they are serrated , so you can easily adjust their size - we get that . But the illustrations on the package show the tabs and the plastic sections being used separated or together . I can understand using the tabs by themselves , but the frosted plastic sections , alone ? You can use a highlighter on the surface - it takes about 15 seconds to dry so it does n't smear - but my package did n't include that information . You can peel the plastic sections off the page and in the short term it does n't lift the printing underneath , but I have no idea what it would be like trying to pull these off after a month or even a year.I ca n't recommend this product because I ca n't make an argument for its use other than to make a quick tab on something . There are better options that are probably cheaper . I do n't think that this product is going to be as popular as the others in their new series of products .	-1
As with other of Avery 's newer notetabs products , I find that this has limited uses . I did not like the thickness ; it is very stiff and difficult to peel . The perforations are pointy after separation and do not leave a nice , clean edge . The material they use is too slick for many writing instruments . The only thing I had that would write well on it was a Sharpie . I feel like I should n't use these in a book in case the marker bleeds through , pushing hard on a pen or pencil makes indentations on the actual page , or the glue sticks too well and damages the paper when removing it . The tab on the end may be the most useful part of the whole product but still does n't make it buyable . I say skip this one and use some Post-it flags and highlighters .	-1
I 'm a longtime user of all sizes of post-it notes and flags to mark pages in books . If I want to write on my note , I 'll use a yellow note page , and if I just want to mark the page , I 'll usually use a flag . I thought I 'd give these heavy duty note tabs a try to see what they would be like . I 'm not impressed , especially given the cost . They are certainly sturdy , and I was able to write on them easily . I found them more heavy duty than any application I 'd consider , and the cheaper post-it note solution is much more cost effective for any use I have for this product . If for some reason you want your sticky notes to last , use these note tabs . Otherwise , there are cheaper and simpler ways to make notes and mark sections of books .	-1
Avery had a great idea withAvery NoteTabs , 3 x 3.5 Inches , Cool Green , 20 per pack ( 16329 ) , and then ruined it.Even though I like most Avery products , I did n't like this design . The perforated edges leave marks on the pages , if you do choose to shorten them .	-1
The concept of the product is good ... a clear , tabbed pouch with a closing envelope-type flap . However , it should be noted that these are self-adhesive . A product improvement would be it make these with holes for placing in a binder.Perhaps more importantly , the closure is hard to use . It is inserting 2 plastic tabs up and into 2 slots on the envelope . It can be done , but not quickly.They appear to be durable , but since they are difficult to close , I would not buy this product .	-1
I went to the Avery site looking for a template . Not to ship from Ebay , just something for myself . All of the templates are for Microsoft Office . I do n't use Office on my Mac , and Pages would not load the templates . So , if I want to use these I 'd have to fire up a Windows machine with Office , but at these prices I 'd not want to do that very often .	-1
I received a package of these for free , but I would never pay for them . Normally , you print out the USPS label to a standard 8.5x11 sheet of white paper , cut it out , and use a glue stick to adhere it to the box . These labels save you the effort of cutting out the label and gluing it . And for that you 'll pay almost fifty cents per package.Perhaps if you ship a lot of items regularly , it might save you enough time and frustration to be worth the costs , but even then I would probably just use a paper cutter and a glue roller.In addition , the adhesive label is slightly too . The sheet is perforated in half , but the label covers the perforation . That means that the `` receipt half '' of the sheet still has some of the label on it .	-1
I used up the strip in one night . In between prints , it leaves like 4 inches of space . Such a waste ! ! ! Not happy with this product.. Do n't buy it .	-1
I 've got a PaperPro stapler at my desk that I love . It is comfortable in my hand , so easy to close/staple and my boss keeps stealing it and leaving it upright in odd places . So when I saw this upright PaperPro stapler I thought maybe he would steal that one instead or that I would like this one better since it is smaller and takes up less space.Nope . My boss still steals my other one . This little blue one works ok but it is n't as easy to close as the bigger one and feels kind of small in my medium-sized female hand . It also takes full-sized staples but only half a sleeve at a time so if I do n't break the staples exactly right I get a mess of smaller bunches .	-1
First of all its black not blue . Despite the color mistake I purchased it because it was cheap and you know what they say . You get what you paid for . Its now called closet filler .	-1
I got this and the Evo at the same time . Even though they are about the same size , the Evo is much better made.The spring assist is nice to have and this stapler will nicely push through a pack of paper . But , the one I got is slightly out of line . It is n't as smooth as it should be , and it tends to jam . I have to be careful when using it.Be sure to read the instructions on the box for how to change staples - it is n't at all intuitive . The concept of this , a stapler you squeeze and store vertically on your desk is nice , but it would be better to make one that is a bit more carefully constructed .	-1
This is a 4/21/2014 update of a review that I originally gave 5 years . And for awhile , the 5 stars were justified . But in the past months , I have had very little luck getting the stapler to put both prongs through more than a few sheets . This morning was typical . I was trying to staple 17 sheets and with every attempt only one prong went through . The second folded over on the top sheet.One star is generous at present , but I reduced the previous 5 stars to 2 because I did have a period when the stapler was new/newish and working fine . *************************************************************************************************************************************************For a long time I have been using an old Bostitch stapler that was once shiny black but is now dull and rusty . It still works , but as always when I try to staple more than a few sheetstogether it is a struggle . More often than not both legs of the staple bend over on the top sheet , or one goes through and the other bends on the top sheet . And sometimes the legsgo through but bend in the wrong direction.But no more . With this powerful , 21st Century stapler stapling is a breeze . Although I have not yet tried 28 sheets , the makers rated capacity I have 15-20 page documents and the stapler performed just fine . The fact that it uses the same regular staples as the other is a plus , and quite amazing how much better it works with the same staples.I have no complaints and am very happy I was able to retire the oldie and replace it with such a well made , powerful upgrade .	-1
Edited : This printer forces you to buy a new color cartridge every 7 to 12 months even if you do n't print a single color document - in fact , it runs out faster than the black cartridge I use all the time . Despite the 'lower ' ink prices I like HP 's cartridges ... in fact I just replaced an HP Black one that had lasted 3 years. -- -- Drawbacks:1 . The color scan quality is very poor , especially if the item is a few millimeters off the surface . Dark areas in particular end up with very little clarity.2 . You can not print if either of the cartridges are empty . This is absolutely unforgivable and clear profiteering by Kodak . This alone is nearly enough not to recommend the printer and one of the biggest contributers to the 3 star review.3 . The ink does tend to run out fairly quickly.4 . Fairly loud and noisy on start up . This is a real pain if you like to turn on/off the printer with a surge protector , the extent of the mechanical noises seems unnecessary .	-1
Printers like this give Kodak a bad name in my opinion . Here 's why : - The color print quality is horrible . It does n't matter if I print from the computer or scan and copy from the unit itself , and it does n't matter if I print on copy paper or high-quality photo paper . No matter what , colors are washed out and dull looking . I even tried adjusting the colors of some of the photos on the computer first , but they still look washed out when printed.- The unit is loud , looks cheap , and feels cheap.- You ca n't print or copy in black and white if your color cartridge is empty ! That 's just insane . Shame on you , Kodak.If I can say two nice things about this printer ( they do n't make up for the above problems though ) : - The speed is OK ( not great , not horrible ) - It seems to have a great wireless detection range . It picks up network IDs in my neighborhood that none of my other devices do.As of the time of this review , I 'd say this printer should be around $ 40-45 and no more .	-1
Okay , start with a printer that does n't use a standard USB connector ( U means universal , Kodak , what part of that do n't you understand ? ) Then missing at the unusually high price are an automatic document feeder and fax and the ability to scan larger items like books . Add a pretty dated design and some seriously cheap plastic parts . What do you have ? A name that is barely known in the printer business compared to the grandaddies HP , Epson and Canon ( remember those names in inkjet printers that are long gone like Xerox ? ) So what about its so-called major virtue , cheap ink ? First off I would have to balance that against the price of the printer , which is almost 3x what I can get one of the big 3 ( four if you count Lexmark ) . Will I make up that difference ? I have n't had this long enough to find out . And then there 's that universal warning about worrying about the cost of ink cartridges for your printer ... it 's not how much the cartridge costs , but how many pages you will get out of the cartridge . Again , I have n't had the Kodak long enough to compare . I will try to update this review once I know.Other than that , Kodak is a known and trusted name and the printer is functional . If you buy one you will probably find it does about as good a job as any other brand . Printers are a commodity anymore , they 're all good . I would make just one final observation . Inkjet printers ALL cost a lot to operate , even for black-only text . Your best bet is to own two printers ... a laser for 85 % of what you will ever print , and an inkjet for the rare times you really need color . And of course for printing photos , if you really do that . And if you do , if you really print photos , do NOT buy a cheap inkjet . Get a quality photo printer and enjoy the art of digital photography .	-1
I 've tried my best to revive this printer from the dead . I 've wasted so much ink and had so many issues that it 's simply impossible to begin on what is wrong with this system . I 've used Kodak ink , compatible ink and swapped them back and forth to no avail . The system simply will not print or copy as it did when brand new.True , the ink is very inexpensive but with the quality of the system so cheaply made the inexpensive ink is hardly worth the cost of having to buy a new system in less than 2 years . I 've run the maintenance , aligned the print heads , changed the ink and still I have no usable printer . What I have is a very large WiFi paperweight that needs to be tossed in the trash if not picked up by Kodak.It 's a shame the system went south . For the first year it printed great , had great quality but it slowly started to print erratically , and the crispness faded out as time went on . If someone offers you this printer , even if it 's free it 's best to avoid the headaches since your print quality will be hit or miss . Kodak used to stand for quality , today - not so much.I 'm very disappointed in this system and do not recommend it to anyone .	-1
Where the scientist ended up with his head spliced onto a fly 's body and was flying around saying `` Help Me , Help Me '' ? That 's the V500 Office scanner . The base of the scanner is the V500 Photo scanner . The top comes from something else . They work together , but aesthetically they do n't exactly match ... they are n't even made out of the same color of plastic.When you first open the box , you find a complete V500 Photo scanner and a separate Automatic Document Feeder . All of the setup instructions refer to the base unit . The sheet is labeled V500 Office , but the ADF unit is n't illustrated or mentioned . ( Step One : Unpack ; Step two : Install Software ; Step Three : Connect and turn on ; Step Four : Scan a photo ... etc ... ) When you 've finished , you end up with a very nice photo scanner and the feeder still in its plastic bag . ( The instructions are up on the Epson website ... to install the feeder , you turn off and open the top of the scanner , unplug the wire connecting the top to the base , lift the top vertically and it will separate from the bottom . Two pegs on the feeder fit into matching holes in the base . Fold it down , plug the power/control wire into connector on the base and fit the horseshoe shaped wire into the tilted input tray . Turn it back on and you should be in business . The software is intelligent enough to detect the presence of the ADF unit and adjust accordingly . ) Installation , though , is something that 's only done once ... what 's really important is how well the scanner works . So , let 's go through the various parts ... Scanner Body - As I mentioned , the main body of the scanner is from the V500 Photo Scanner . Because it 's designed to scan negatives as well as pictures , it has a fairly high optical resolution and a decent , although not spectacular dynamic range ( D=3.4 , if you 're into the actual spec . The D value is a measure of how well a scanner can capture shadow and highlight detail ... the higher the value the better . The V700 measures at D=4.0 . Professional grade scanners can be substantially higher , while I 've seen inexpensive units spec'ed as low as 1.8 . ) When using the glass platen , you can scan up to a standard 8.5 '' x11 '' letter-size paper . Legal size pages can be scanned using the document feeder.Automatic Document Feeder - The ADF holds roughly 30 sheets of paper for scanning . It 's strictly a single sided scanner . You 'll need to run the paper through twice if you need to scan both sides of a document and then merge the two files together . I 've had some serious problems with the feeder . It 's common for it to pick up the top sheet off the stack , but then not feed it through the scanner . It also appears that the ADF has some other `` unusual '' features ... this question , for example , is on the Epson website FAQ : Q : The automatic document feeder pulls two sheets of paper when I click Preview . Can I make it pull only one sheet ? A : No.It seems like the firmware needs a bit of updating . When it was working right , the ADF worked well . The scanning speed is dependent on the resolution and the speed of the computer that it 's connected to . The linearity seems pretty good , with my scans of graph paper showing only a few hiccups.V500 Photo Scanner Lid - The photo scanner lid comes with holders for both slides and various sizes of negatives . The normal white reflective surface can be removed and replaced with one of the negative holders . This allows the built-in light source to shine through the negatives . You can scan two strips of 35mm film , 120 or 220 film and larger negatives . If somebody has an archive of old 4x5 view camera negatives , this will convert them to digital form , but , frankly , for that kind of work , you should use a scanner with a better dynamic range . You NEVER want to send photos through the ADF , they 're too likely to get scratched or mangled.Software - Epson 's software package includes the Epson scanner driver and Abbyy FineReader 6.0 ( the current version direct from Abbyy is 10.0 ) . The scanner driver has three levels of complexity - Home , Office , and Professional . The Office level provides enough flexibility for almost every application and I always leave it there . I suspect that the other two levels are the result of some misguided marketing guy 's attempt to address different market segments . Files can be created as .JPG , PDF and a couple of other formats . For document scanning , I always use PDF . For photos , I use the lossless TIFF format to preserve as much of the original detail as possible . The Abbyy software works well in converting the scanned images into searchable PDF files , but wo n't take an external PDF and make it searchable or convert it to a Word document ... you have to purchase the new version to add those functions.Service - Nothing works forever , but , after two weeks , I was not happy when the document feeder stopped properly feeding pages . Today , I called the Epson service center to see if they had any suggestions to get it to work properly . The tech was very polite and after being put on hold twice and asked the usual troubleshooting questions , I was told that this was an `` extremely unusual '' hardware failure . He put me on hold a third time and after 29minutes and 22 seconds , the call disconnected . I called back and another support technician looked up the notes . He told me that I needed to take the scanner to an authorized service depot for repair . They would n't ship me another unit or issue an RMA number . I could ship it there , but at my expense . I was also told that this is the way that Epson handles all scanner repairs . I could understand that if the scanner was a year old or otherwise out of warranty , but for something that 's only two weeks old ? ? ? Not exactly the most customer-centric way of doing things.So ... my conclusion ... This scanner is a bit of a misfit . There are better scanners more suited for an office environment . Both theEpson WorkForce Pro GT-S50and theFujitsu ScanSnap S1500are faster , have duplex scanning and are designed for heavy duty use ( I 've run 50K+ sheets through my Fujitsu S510 ( an earlier model ) and 20K+ sheets through my GT-S50 . I replaced the rollers on the Fujitsu and it runs like new . ) Both are also about $ 100 more expensive . As a practical matter , most offices do n't need the photo scanning features that the V500 Office provides . For home use , you need a printer anyway , so I 'd go with a multi-function machine with a built-in scanner and document feeder . I really like theEpson Artisan 810 . It 's small and works very well ... my review of that unit is near the top of the second page of reviews . TheCanon PIXMA MX860or Canon MX700 are also a good units that I 've used at home and at my office . If you want to add negative/photo scanning , the V500 Photo , without the document feeder , is $ 100+ less than the V500 Office . The V500 Office 's features , taken by themselves , warrant a four star rating ... but you ca n't look at it by itself . A computer , scanner and printer need to be evaluated as a system . And when you add it all together and mix in the service problems , it 's dropped down to the two star level .	-1
I really like the concept of this travel organizer - it is closed on two sides and has 3 sections in which to place papers . There is a handy flap on one of the open sides to secure papers from falling out . I like the envelope on the front . However , I was greatly disappointed in the quality of the product - the black plastic backing and clear plastic dividers are very flimsy and the organizer folds onto itself . I do not think it adequately protects papers from damage/folding , especially if it were to be used for traveling ( which was my intention ) . It needs to be made of much heavier plastic . It is very expensive for the quality . I ended up returning this item.An alternate item that does have an acceptable heavier plastic backing and is similar is the Smead Three-Divider Project Jacket , Letter Size , Poly , Assorted Colors . That product is quite good and appears to have much of the same design ( but uses a heavier backing ) , except that it lacks the envelope and side flap to secure papers on one of the open sides . I am using this product to organize papers and transport in a tote bag . It held up well on a business trip .	-1
This item is a disappointment . I suppose a traveler might use it for tickets , itineraries , hotel bills and maps , but I would n't . Might work for frequent work-related travel , but if I bought it in anticipation of an upcoming vacation , I would be disappointed . I can see , however , adapting it for other purposes , like sorting sandpaper as another reviewer suggested . The top and one side are both open , so items are n't secure , although removal would be easier I suppose . I might like it more if it were three hole punched . I can imagine using this product in a notebook , like my church treasurer 's notebook , where some items ( like credit cards ) need to be held securely , and others , like our tax exempt documents , need to be stored but kept readily accessible . Anyway , this might be handy for a regular business traveler who carries it in his/her briefcase . Do n't buy it , however , if you need something to organize your travel documents for your leisure travel . It will not be helpful in that regard .	-1
When these showed up I thought they only sent me one folder but these are so thin both were there.The plastic film they are made of seems to be a bit thin and im not sure how long they will last.Its a good design but cheaply made.The price of them is to high also.I can see maybe six dollars but no higher .	-1
A nice-looking , well-built printer is easy to use , with a high-quality scan/copy function , but it stumbles on installation issues and falls down entirely on inkjet problems.The new just-unpackaged cartridges printed fine at first , but when I got back to the printer a few days later , the black was splotchy , and all my efforts would n't make this nearly-new cartridge print correctly again ( cleaning , re-seating , test page after test page , recalibrating and realigning repeatedly , etc ) .Oddly enough , what must be a frequent issue was nowhere to be found on the Lexmark support site FAQ , and I had to email support to ask what to do . To Lexmark 's credit , they replied with directions within a matter of hours , directing me to a `` Deep Clean '' option from the printer 's console ( oddly , not found in the software ) , which finally corrected the problem . A rather offputting introduction to inkjet printers ! Print quality on plain paper ( multipurpose 20lb that I also use for laser ) is acceptable , but nothing special . Solid areas of ink look `` wet '' and the paper wrinkles a bit until fully dry , and even then does n't look entirely flat . Worse , the colored inks run easily . A single droplet of water from an errant drink causes the color to smear and run ( especially cyan and magenta , but somewhat the yellow also ) . Far from archival quality -- it might be better on specialty paper , but who wants to use fancy paper for everyday printing ? The print heads move with some considerable force -- the table this printer sits on vibrates and shakes while the printer is going . It 's a low-end IKEA table , but I was surprised by how much side-to-side momentum the printhead uses . It makes me miss my old , much quieter color-laser printer.All this is beside the fact that inkjet printing costs much more per-page than laser . If it worked particularly well ( as it does in my Canon photo printer ) , then it 's worth the higher cost , but in the Lexmark , inkjet is the worst of both worlds -- expensive and low-quality.I 've traditionally used laser-printers or photo-printers , so I 'm not sure if these problems are common to inkjets , or just to Lexmark ink . Either way , it 's offputting . `` Colorfast '' seems like a basic requirement to me.The printer lacks a quick-setup guide and instead uses a combination of a prompted install process on the PC combined with directions on the printer 's LCD . Unfortunately what should have beeen easy-to-follow missed basic steps such as going back to actually add the printer ( to windows ) once the initial configuration was completed ( which included physical setup but left the printer unusable from within Windows ) . Installers are basic , all major vendors should just get this right -- is n't that what Quality Assurance is for ? Wifi setup ca n't be done from the printer , and has to be done from win/mac over USB . That 's a contrast from other functions that can only be done from the printer 's panel.The update option from inside the software failed ( no meaningful error ) , and the support links from the software went to dead Lexmark pages ( tried the software from the install disc as well as updated from website ) . The latter usually implies a website redesign that did n't correctly redirect support URLs to allow for existing software versions . It 's not a big deal in the world of Google search , but implies a degree of sloppiness -- this printer has only been around for a year or so ? ? And it makes the all-in-one portal program pretty useless -- why even have the portal be a windows program , rather than just a shortcut to an up-to-date portal page that is printer specific , or an in-printer webpage ? The printer is sturdy , and feels well-made ( heavy lid , solid plastic , etc ) other than aforementioned `` printhead jerks the printer around '' issue . It has an auto sleep mode and wakes up from `` sleep '' very rapidly on access.As far as support goes , a printer firmware upgrade worked flawlessly over wireless , a nice unexpected touch ( did n't need to reconnect to USB ) . So good firmware updating and email response , the rest leaves something to be desired.This unit is a much better scanner/copier than it is a printer . It scans faster than my 4 year old mid-range HP flatbed scanner , with sharper , crisper output . Scan and copy of a color image is fast . The `` send to PC '' option worked surprisingly flawlessly , no interaction needed , it kicks off a scan import dialogue on the PC . Graphics scanned as a PDF looked low-quality , but scanned as a photograph they looked very good . Some scan options are available only on the printer 's console , rather than in-software -- it would be nice if they were available in both places.I did not test fax , an obsolete technology I try to ignore . All of this was on a PC running a current Windows7 SP1.Quirks aside , it 's the inkjet behavior and problems that make this Not Recommended , although I like the design , and it 's a very decent scanner . For an all-in-one , I 'd look for a laser model instead .	-1
The Lexmark PRO205 is a sharp looking printer . Setting the printer up on my small office network was an easy quick process ; even if entering information via the small keypad is somewhat tedious . Unfortunately , though , the PRO205 's print output is disappointing.On black and white text , the bulk of what I print , the ink stayed wet far too long . Invariably , if I grabbed a freshly output document , my fingers would smear any ink they came into contact with . The quality of the unsmeared text was what one would expect from a new inkjet but still not laser quality . I put several brands of inkjet , laser , and all-purpose paper through this printer ; all were susceptible to smeared ink.Color photo output was atrocious . Mottled and blotchy best describes the finished product . Again , I used different photo papers . Again , I received the same result . As is the case with black and white output , ink smearing was and is a major problem . None of the settings I tried , including the one for glossy paper , solved the smearing problem.As a scanner , the machine is satisfactory . Color photos I scanned displayed very nicely on my computer screen . Trouble is , the PRO205 is an all-in-one unit . Such a device , that can not produce good output , is almost worthless in the small office setting . I did not test the unit 's fax capability because I can not foresee I will every rely on this machine to do anything other than scan.In sum , easy setup , good looks , and quality scanning in no way offset the poor print output of this Lexmark .	-1
Well , the service was fast in getting it delivered , but what a pile of scrap metal . Assemble was easy , however , the end result is a chair that is not overly comfortable , but functional for short bursts at a desk . Well , even with `` short bursts '' , the hydraulic pole that holds up the chair keeps collapsing to the lowest position ; oh , and might I add it 's not even four months . I 'm 185 pounds so there 's no excuse . Spend a little more and get a chair that works . If this were food , it would be McDonald 's . These are the type of things that are tough to return to Amazon ... . so think long and hard before you decide to go on the cheap with a new desk chair .	-1
After reading hundreds of reviews and waiting for a l-o-n-g time , I finally decided to take the plunge and buy an Ooma system ( the Telo ) . Setup went very smoothly , and the first calls on the first day were great . It 's been about two weeks now , and it 's been downhill steadily.On day 1 , I found out that despite their claims of portability , Ooma could not port my phone number . Moreover , despite their claims of being able to provide a number within my calling area , they could n't do that either . I settled for a completely `` alien '' number . I also learned that it is not free service . State taxes on phone service must be paid each month regardless of having the Ooma system , and a great many of the Ooma features are available only with their $ 10/month Premier service.On day 2 , Ooma began sending all my calls to voice mail without giving me a chance to answer . It also cut off the caller , so they were unable to leave a message . I contacted Ooma support ; they adjusted the software and had me reboot . Worked okay.On day 3 , I began getting complaints from callers about lag time . The voice lags about 3-4 seconds , causing conversations to `` step all over each other . '' Ooma 's response : It 's a known problem and we hope users will continue to provide feedback so we can solve it.On day 4 , callers began to complain that I always sounded as if I were on a very bad cell phone connection -- interference , dropouts , crackling , static , etc . Ooma 's response : Your internet service probably is n't fast enough . Since I have the fastest Internet service available from any ISP , clearly this is not the problem . Ooma then acknowledged that yes , it 's possible the problem is theirs ; they just like to have everyone check their ISP first.On day 5 , extreme echoing was added to the list of call quality complaints.After debating for several days whether the very poor call quality was worth the very low price of using Ooma , today it again started to send all my calls straight to voice mail . Checking the Ooma support forum , I see it 's happening to many users all over the country . Obviously , another Ooma software problem.My choice comes down to great phone service with horrific customer support at high cost with the traditional phone company , or horrific phone service with helpful customer support at low cost with Ooma . Since the primary purpose of having the phone at all is to make and receive phone calls reliably , I guess I 'll have to opt for the former . I could not be more disappointed about that .	-1
The good : calls sound crystal clear , no issues with domestic calling . Website is a bit sparse but functional . Responsive customer support.The bad:1. International calls are spotty at best . Calls to Ukraine , for example , will never go through no matter what . Customer support told me that Ooma uses a cheap 3rd party international VOIP provider , which `` sometimes works , sometimes does n't . '' In my case , it never worked . Was told that an agreement was pending with a better provider to route international calls but no ETA was given.2 . Bluetooth functionality is advertised as standard . What you are NOT told is that a ) the ooma telo accepts ONLY Ooma supplied USB bluetooth dongle and b ) you must pay $ 10 a MONTH for this functionality ( really , for Ooma premier but you can not use bluetooth at home without subscribing to `` Premier '' ! ) . At a time when these dongles cost less than 10 dollars , I think this is a major rip off when a year later you will have paid $ 120 for the stupid dongle and a set of dubious features . Seems kind of sleazy to force people to use Ooma supplied bluetooth adapter , when so many adapters are available . You used to be able to use a generic bluetooth adapter but Ooma removed this functionality . Not cool . Imagine if after buying a car with hands free bluetooth calling you find out you must subscribe to `` Ford Premier '' to use bluetooth to connect to your car . Silly stuff.Otherwise works well , looks good on my desk , will keep it .	-1
I just got the OOMA telco headset in the mail yesterday . It was simple to setup and get up and running . Except that less than 12 hours later OOMA made a stupid mistake . The phone number I got from OOMA was being used by someone else . I was able to dial out , but the people that called me at home through my ooma telco . They received a different household . So I decided to call home and got an old Asian lady with broken English . We spoke and found out that she was porting the number to some where else . But OOma gave it to me . So I called OOMA to get this sorted out . First thing they ask me was lets test the device . I tell them its not the device , its your phone system switching and messing up and giving out duplicate number . I mentioned the girl on the phone to give me a new number but she kept on insisting on being in front of my device . I tolled her , your not listening . I am away from my phone right now and work late so by the time i get home you guys are out . She replied , I take it your not in front of your phone . Gsus effin christ ! She then tolled me to call back later so I tolled her its ok ill make it easy for you and especially for me . I am returning your product back and getting my money back and begrudgingly keeping Vonage . Buh-Bye .	-1
If you do n't want their `` premier '' subscription , then watch out . They started me off with 3 free months of premier , then , once that time is expired , started charging me $ 15 a month , even though I chose the basic subscription level during the setup . The only way to change this is to try calling them , and once I finally got through to them after half a dozen tries , I told them to downgrade me to the normal basic subscription level , to which they said they would . A couple days later , all service to my telo stops . I called them to find out that they completely canceled my service . So now I have to resubscribe and go through this mess all over again.I should have known that something like this would happen once I saw that they wanted to charge you for what is advertised as a `` free '' phone service . The item title for this amazon page literally says `` free home phone service '' even though you will still get charged for even the basic service .	-1
First , I need to say that when OOMA works , that the service is good , but the voice quality could be improved . The Premium service is worth the money as it adds a lot of features that other phone companies do n't offer . I really like their Internet web site for managing the service . Customer Service is good.However , there are some negative aspects about OOMA Telo that you should know about before you purchase one.1 ) The OOMA Telo units are unreliable . The first unit went bad after 10 months of a 12 month warranty . Purchased a new Telo from Frys because they had a sale . It went bad after 10 days . OOMA sent out a replacement unit . It only lasted for 10 days . The OOMA service is good , I ca n't say that about the hardware . If you are looking for reliable service , OOMA is not it.2 ) The OOMA Telo units can not be repaired . Of course they can be repaired , but OOMA refuses to do it . OOMA makes their money from selling new Telo units . Maybe that is the reason why they are so unreliable . After the 12 month warranty is done , you can not get the unit repaired . You must purchase a new one.3 ) Under warranty , replacement units take 7 to 10 days to receive . How many people can be without a phone for 7 to 10 days ? 4 ) The setup is too complicated for senior citizens . They do n't want to be bothered with repairing the phone all of the time . They have had reliable phone service all of their life . Nobody needs these problems.Because of these problems , we are switching back to Time Warner cable . To port the phone number to another phone company , you need to provide this information.Phone Company - OOMAAccount number - Your phone number with OOMAAccount holder nameYour addressYour phone number	-1
We found the pricing to be misleading . The saying goes , there 's no free lunch.By the time we added the Premier features , and payed all the extra recovery fees , we were n't really saving.After shopping around , we found an alternative voip service ( voiSip ) that has better pricing , and more features . We even used the `` savings calculator '' on the Ooma website to that Ooma was more expensive in the long run.But the nail in the coffin for Ooma was that we were tied to their box and 1-line . With voiSip , we could choose from 2 , 4 or more line phone equipment . No extra charge on the service , just buy the equipment and select a minute package as low as 6 bucks.Ooma was a neat idea , but their price changes made it less appealing .	-1
I had it for a year . Very good product and it saved me a lot of money since I dropped the land line with ATT . The only issue I have is that sometime it drops the calls . It does n't happen often , but when it does it can be a little frustrating . Overall I 'm very happy with the purchase and if not occasional call drop it would have been solid five star review.Update 7-11-11I downgraded my initial review from 4 stars to 1 star.First unit stopped working after 11 months ( it was still under warranty ) . Second new unit lasted only 5 month before it broke . At that rate of breakage the ooma might not be very economical unless purchase extended warranty .	-1
Update . They have made the service almost as good as AT & T and there is only a few glitches like the Ooma answering service will pick up the call and you will have to log onto the internet with speakers attached to your computer to hear the call . The biggest problem is the Ooma Premier package that claims that you call stop unwanted calls by using the community black list . This is misleading because there are so many new scammers , telemarketers and the such that are coming online to call you that you will never get any peace from the phone ringing by any means that are known to me ! The philosophy of the company is to lie to you by any means to get you into service because they think , rather they know that when you pay only 5 dollars a month in federal and state taxes that you will not terminate the service to prove that you will not take being lied to ! Keep your money for the Premier service because you can not stop telemarketers that just change the name of the person calling on the ID of the machine that dials you and the service the caries there call like to can pick what your caller ID name is on Ooma .	-1
A loud humming sound was present on the Ooma phone line when the Ooma device was located anywhere near my DECT 6.0 cordless phone base station , and only when a cordless handset was being used . Apparently Ooma is very susceptible to RF interference ( might happen if near my WiFi router as well ) . After reading 5 pages of people complaining about the humming sound on the Ooma forum , I managed to reduce the hum by running a wire from the shield of the Ooma USB connector to house ground . But voice quality still is n't great.I was annoyed that the Ooma has only one phone jack despite advertising support for two lines . A second phone line requires an special Ooma handset ( plus the $ 10/month `` Premier '' subscription ) , so it wo n't work with 2-line phones . I would perhaps suggest using amagicJack Plusfor a second line.There is no backup battery in the Ooma to protect against power loss , so you may want to buy a UPS for both the Ooma and your router , to enable calls when the power is out.After using this for a month , I have noted that many calls do not go through . On some outgoing calls , I get a `` busy signal '' on the first attempt , when the person I was calling was not on the phone . Sometimes people that try to call me get a `` can not take your call right now '' message on incoming calls ( when I 'm not on the phone ) . So far the call has always worked on the second attempt , but me and my callers really should n't need to try multiple times.Got this at Costco for a good price and the unlimited return policy .	-1
These are n't index cards really . Not made of card stock . These are the exact same thickness as those anoying magazine subscription card paper mailers that fall out of magazines . Nothing but flex . Could n't scoop up a penny off your desk with one as it would not hold the weight .	-1
I have been searching for REAL index cards for over a year now . I do n't think anyone makes them anymore . These are cheap , flimsy , slightly thick paper . You can get the same quality at walmart or any other merchant . Why companies do n't make actual index CARDS anymore is beyond me . These certainly are n't what I was hoping for . I will not be purchasing them again .	-1
These index cards are very thin . I use them for flash cards , with a Sharpie on one side and pen on the other . The bleed-through is pretty terrible . It 's so hard to tell from a package which cards will be thick enough ; these are n't ! They still work for their purpose , but I really wish that I had thicker index cards to work with .	-1
Right size , too flimsy - they are very light weight stock and I ca n't say I like them as much as the ones I usually get in stores .	-1
I bought this scanner , based on all the positive reviews , because I wanted better quality slide and negative scanning than my old Canon.Unfortunately , I did n't get far enough to check that out.My first problem involved scanning documents . I found that the machine was cropping the document to the very edge of the text and sometimes cropping out the text.I went online to Epson 's tech support page to get the tech support phone number . Turns out that tech support is not a toll free number . STRIKE ONE.I called tech support and got some foreign dimwit who , every time I asked a question , said `` hold on '' and went away for a few minutes . After that happened a few times I hung up . STRIKE TWO.Then I went on a scanner forum and posted my question . I got an almost immediate response and the problem was solved.Next issue that arose was when I was scanning multiple photos . The user guide says keep them an inch apart . I did but they kept coming out as one image until I put only two photos on the scanner . My old Canon would separate a lot more than two photos but not really a deal breaker.Then I had the idea to scan my collection of business cards , hoping that I could put several on the scanner at once and have them separated into multiple jpeg 's instead of scanning them one at a time . Did n't happen . They all came out as one document no matter what mode I was in . STRIKE THREE . YER OUT , EPSON.After getting my return label and dropping it off at UPS I hooked my old Canon back up , put 8 cards on the scanner and got 8 separate jpegs . I profusely apologized to my Canon and we have reconciled.PS : Canon has toll free tech support .	-1
I know this is n't meant for hard core duty , but it still feels pretty cheap . a 2 year old could probably pick the lock . Mine came damaged , the corner was bent in one the left side , so it does n't shut all the way , but I was outside the return time frame , so I just get to deal with this piece of junk . Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for something a little more quality .	-1
UPDATE : See the pictures I uploaded.REVIEWMy fiance , who is a computer whiz and has a degree in it , helped me with the review , so the problems I experienced are probably not due to my own fault.I set up this printer on my Windows XP desktop and laptop . The setup process was troublesome and I 'm not impressed with the print quality . My experience is described below . **Setup**Unpacking and cartridge installation is well documented and relatively straightforward , but unless you follow the instructions and have some manual dexterity , you will get toner on your hands and possibly elsewhere - the protective plastic films that must be removed from the cartridges have toner on them . ( Arrange the foil bag you took the cartridge from so that you can put the protective film into it while holding the cartridge in your other hand ) .The procedure to connect the printer via USB or wired-ethernet is straightforward too , although annoyingly Brother encourages you to run their own driver installation program ( supplied on CD ) rather than adhering to the standard Microsoft Windows printer driver installation scheme . As supplied CDs are often out of date , I went to download the latest version from the Brother website , but alarmingly , the installation program supplied on the CD is not available there . ( There is a driver there , but it is nothing like the program described in the manual supplied with the printer ) .Setting up the printer for wireless networking is where things started to get troublesome . If your wireless router is quite new and supports SES/WPS/AOSS ( where you press a button on your router which tells it to allow the printer to connect and get the wireless password and settings , similar to bluetooth pairing ) , you 're in luck . Otherwise , to complete the setup , Brother 's oxymoronic recommendation is to hook up the printer to your access point with an ethernet cable ( note that you need to go through an access point - you ca n't just hook a laptop directly to the printer without a crossed cable ) , which completely defeats the purpose of the wireless feature , that is to allow the printer to be located where it 's not practical to run an ethernet cable . If it was a light inkjet printer , temporarily carrying it to your access point would be tolerable , but this printer weighs ~ 45 lbs.Thankfully , there is another method to complete the setup wirelessly from a laptop or desktop with a wireless network card , if you can find it buried in the `` Network User 's Guide '' . There 's no mention of it in the only printed manual that comes with the printer ( the quick start guide ) .This method temporarily changes your wireless settings to connect to the printer to give it the password and settings for your wireless network.During setup , I also discovered there have been several firmware updates in the short time this printer has been available . It does n't instil confidence that Brother released this printer with several problems that needed fixing . My firmware was out of date so I updated . The `` Status Monitor '' program installed with the driver will check for updated firmware , but not install it . It just directs you to the website where you have to manually download and install the firmware . **Print Quality**The demo page printed during setup looks very impressive , after some real-world tests , it 's clear that this demo image is carefully chosen to mask many potential quality problems . Text and lines , at least , print very well . They 're sharp and crisp , and the colors are bright if you print in color . Images are a different story however . Periodic banding ( perpendicular to the paper feed direction ) is visible throughout the image and is especially noticeable in areas of solid color . Updating the firmware and running the calibration routine did n't improve the print quality . **Conclusion**Pros : Reasonably priced tonerBuilt-in wireless networkingGood quality text printingFastCons : Poor quality photo/graphics printingBigger and heavier than some of the competition ( e.g . Samsung CLP-315 ) No USB or network cable includedNoisyNot the most asthetic designFull disclosure : I received a test model of this product for review but was not compensated in any way for reviewing it .	-1
I 'm a third-year law student , which pretty much means I 'm an expert on highlighters.These are not good for highlighting . It 's difficult to explain , but the tip is very solid and stiff and is difficult to actually use to highlight . I also do n't like how much effort it takes to click the tip out . It 's not effortless like a bic pen , which is annoying if you need to do it a lot ( like when reading a long document ) . I much prefer other Sharpie highlighters that have caps instead of the retractable style .	-1
I bought these because I trusted the Sharpie brand and used their products before without problem . These highlighters do n't last as long as they should . They bleed through normal thickness paper , and they smear a lot . Look for a different brand .	-1
While these ink cartridges fit , they are not well marked . I had trouble to tell which was which but worked it out .	-1
( Updated to reflect experience and the updated version `` C '' firmware . ) This Brother color MFC is a reasonable choice if you are looking for a wired or wireless networked high speed laser-like color printer , copier , scanner and fax all-in-one , but do not need duplex ( two-sided ) printing/faxing/scanning . Personally , I duplex almost everything to save paper , and so would prefer the modelBrother MFC-9840CDW Color Laser Multifunction Center with Wireless Interface and Duplexwhich is a small price increase over this one . ( You can manually duplex with the MFC-9320CW by printing odd numbered pages , taking the output stack and placing it in the paper tray , and the printing the even number pages . But , just one paper jam would ruin that process . ) I have a variety of complaints about the machine and the software which prevent me from giving it more than three stars.Note that laser-class printers are no substitute for photo printers . Do not expect photo quality color ( or even a very wide color gamut ) or the ability to print on photo paper . That is not what this class of device is for . If photo quality is your expectation , look to inkjet photo printers . ( The scanner on this device is photo-quality , though . ) My rating is based on the reasonable expectations of what a color laser is supposed to do : spot color , color graphics , mixed text and graphics documents , reasonable color copies ... . and all water resistant , due to the fused toner.Both wired and wireless networking worked well , although the instructions for the wireless setup are written by and for a geek , so if you 're not a techie , you 'll probably need a tech friend to help if your wireless network is secure , with hidden SID and password . It is really annoying that the device prints two sheets of paper when you change the network settings , one with the wired and one with the wireless settings . That should be a user option.The printer comes with four toner cartridges , each good for about 1,000 pages according to the instructions . But , there is some kind of bug in the firmware or the software . After printing only a handful of pages , both the device and the software monitor reported that the Cyan cartridge was almost empty . The color bar charts showed it empty . But , the web-based control panel for the printer showed all cartridges full . The only way to get rid of the Cyan empty messages in all places was to turn the MFC off and then back on again . Installing the software onto another computer on the network caused the message to come back - this time saying that both Cyan and Yellow were empty . Updating the firmware from the delivered version `` A '' to the current downloadable version `` C '' seems to have fixed this problem.Print quality is quite good , but requires adjustments for printing photos . I printed the PDF for a software user manual that included various color screenshots . It looks terrific and printed at close to the 17 PPM advertised rate . Nice.Even if it is not a photo printer , photos are part of what will be printed on a color laser - as part of newsletters , real estate flyers , business cards , etc . So I looked at what I needed to do to get the best results from color-calibrated source images.Anything containing photos really has to be printed in the 600 X 2400 resolution to get all of the details . ( 600 x 600 is fine for most other documents . ) The white foam of the waterfall in a test image just blurred together at 600 x 600 resolution . 600 x 600 on this LED printer is not the same crispness as 600 x 600 on a laser.I found that photographic images require printing with the Vivid color option , and with brightness increased . Even though a color wheel looked good , a calibration image containing various faces for skin tones , color patches and resulted in skin tones that looked sepia , in spite of some other colors in the image looking close to correct . I had to bump the red level to +12 and brightness to +4 in the print settings dialog to start to get the skin to look like skin . Even then , it was somewhat orange-sepia . Neither the Caucasian , Asian or African American babies ' skin looked right , but the image was more usable . It seemed wrong that a bump of +12 ( out of 20 ) on red made so little difference . Further , on making a color photocopy , where there is only +1 and +2 for red , the +1 improved the red in some places , but made green grass look yellow . There is no reason that adding red should cause that . So , I think that there are some firmware and/or software issues yet to be resolved here by Brother.Manual fed items must be fed one at a time , unlike other Brother MFC machines that have a multifunction tray that accepts several sheets at once as an alternate feed tray . But a plus is that when you use the manual feed slot , you can open the back of the machine so that thick card stock can feed straight through the machine ( after setting the paper type setting to `` thicker '' ) . It is not a truly straight path - the paper comes out the back pointing upwards and has a slight curl to it.After attempting to print both brochures and business cards with the manual feed , I have to give the manual feed mechanism only 1 star . It is impossible to get a piece of paper to feed through perfectly straight . So , it is hard to get business cards , labels , etc to align properly . The manual feed slot has guide bars that are only an inch and half long in a lip that is a little over 2 inches long . So , not only must you stand there , holding the piece of paper as you insert it ( there is no tray ) , it is impossible in a little over an inch to make sure that the piece of paper is feeding straight . Infuriating . I should note that trying to print brochures on thin stock via the paper tray resulted in skewed images also - so the printer is incapable of feeding paper absolutely straight there either.The manual feed is also infuriatingly temperamental . If you do n't push the piece of paper far enough , or too far , the printer senses a paper jam . No paper has even entered the printer yet . The directions ask you to open the printer and remove all four drum-toner elements - which requires someplace convenient to put them . In this case , that is not necessary - just shut the printer again and wait for several minutes while it rechecks itself , try to fee your paper again , and repeat.Toner fixing was a major problem with the business card printing . More often than not , the last 1/3 of the page was not fixed and just smeared . I found a buried setting for 'improve fixing ' , and also held the paper as it came out the rear slot of the machine , and things improved . But , I still experienced smeared or lumpy toner on the page itself at times - some of it no doubt left on the drums from the previous page that was not properly fixed.The software is common to most Brother MFC products . I am more than annoyed that after so many years , Brother has done nothing to improve their software for Macs . Yes , things work on a Mac , but you do not have the identical functionality as on Windows.The printer driver interface for Windows has various options of handling ( manual ) duplexing . On the Mac , your options are to print either odd or even pages and in normal or reverse order . Finally , Windows users have ControlCenter3 which lets me choose between my two installed Brother MFC devices . On the Mac , it is ControlCenter2 which will not give multiple devices in its drop-down list . I have to browse each time I want to switch to a different Brother MFC.Another complaint about the software installation is that it does not automatically check the Brother web site to see if there are updates . You have to manually do that after installing . Even then , the Brother web site is not very transparent , giving September 2009 dates to `` updates '' that , when downloaded , were created in January 2009 and thus are not even required . The names and functions of the update files are pretty obscure . I know what they all do as I 've had Brother machines for some years . But , non-techie friends would not have a clue as to what to download or why . As an example : you would never know that if the ControlCenter stopped running and needed to be re-installed , that it was part of the Twain driver.Scanning on the Mac stores the scanned files in the hidden /tmp/ & lt ; user > directory at the root of the boot drive . You have to use Finder 's menus to go to that folder and purge it . On the other hand , if you set up custom scans , you can both specify the folder into which the resulting file is placed , as well as have a Finder window open to that folder after a scan completes . I recommend this approach for Windows and Mac.The OCR capabilities delivered via the Twain driver or ControlCenter are really primitive on Windows , and just plain bad on OS X . On Windows , the OCR is done by PaperPort OCR ; on Mac it is done by Newsoft OCR . When presented with a page having three columns of text and a few font changes , and selecting rich text scanning , on Windows , the text was scanned almost error-free , but without any font changes . On OS X ( Snow Leopard ) , the text was scanned as columns with breaks but with lots of errors and all over the page ; basically useless . Even on Windows , better OCR software can scan the full page , including layout and images . Not so here.The MFC has a USB port in the front into which you can plug a thumb drive or digital camera . With no connection to a computer , you can page through the files on the drive or camera and choose the ones you want to print directly from the memory device . I printed a PDF from a thumb drive just fine , and then scanned an image directly onto the thumb drive . Kind of a cool feature if you have someone who wants to 'borrow ' your printer or scanner - they do n't need to get onto any of your computers.When the machine is awake , there is a really annoying high-pitched buzz/whine . It is pure bliss when it goes to sleep and the noise stops . I 'm running it wired to my router , but I may run wireless just so I can move this elsewhere and not have to listen to it.The lack of response to color adjustments , poor toner fixing and bleeding , inability to feed paper perfectly straight through the manual feed or the paper tray are my main concerns now that I 've figured out most of the quirks of this machine . If those issues go away in time , I 'll update this review again .	-1
I will make every attempt to be scrupulously fair in writing this review , because I have a real problem with seller 's customer service representative . More about that later . First of all , this is the second time I have ordered this presumed `` genuine '' Lexmark tri-pack of color ink replacement cartridges , first from another seller , and now from pckink.com , each time with the same results . The cyan and yellow cartridges in particular , but sometimes also the magenta cartridge , have continued to produce streaks on test prints I ran with my Lexmark Pinnacle 901 Pro when the printer suddenly would not produce the correct colors . Each time this happened , I ran repeated print head cleaning sequences , including deep cleanings , often to the point of almost completely exhausting the ink supply . On the few occasions when the problem ultimately disappeared , it soon began to recur and I again tried the head cleaning procedure . In the process , I went through several sets of color ink . I ordered this last set of cartridges from pckink.com because of its generally favorable reviews . However , this set was no exception and it again produced the familiar streaky test prints . Secondly , it must be said that the faulty ink cartridges themselves are not to be blamed on the merchant , but rather are clearly a manufacturer 's defect . However , I do have a real problem with this seller 's approach to customer service . When I reported the problem to pckink.com , I received a very curt , dismissive , discourteous e-mail response , which contained neither salutation , complimentary close , nor even identified the sender by name . It basically stated that I was the `` only customer '' who had experienced a problem with these cartridges and that I needed to `` send them back . '' Yet , on looking at the reviews for this particular tri-pack of ink , it turned out that several other customers had rated it 1- and 2-stars , and one had indicated that he would have awarded 0 stars if that option had been available . I then asked pcklink.com for a pre-paid return mailing label and stated that , unless that was provided , I would simply add my 1-star review to the others . Very quickly after that , I received another e-mail stating that a full refund would be issued and nothing was mentioned about the need to return the cartridges . The vendor did , however , ask me to take my future business elsewhere , something I would quite obviously have done without that invitation , but nevertheless this gratuitous remark was not exactly a very diplomatic move on the part of the seller either . The bottom line is that I do n't blame the faulty ink on the vendor but I do hold him accountable in this review for unacceptable customer service , which suddenly became responsive only under threat of an unfavorable rating . I award 2 stars solely because the seller ultimately issued a refund ; otherwise my rating would have been equivalent to zero stars .	-1
These do n't last very long at all and the printer shows that all the color cartridges are 3/4 full.This is the second time this has happened with the Lexmark 100 color ink cartridge tri-pack..I do n't have these issues with the black ink cartridges . I know this because I refill them all at the same time . The black is still working now . However , there is no color output whatsoever , when I try to print in color.I would rather buy a new printer , from a different manufacturer , than invest in one more set of these color cartridges from Lexmark .	-1
Why just one star ? Well , it 's nothing to do with the quality of the printer . Nor is it to do with the quality of the ink . Heck , it does n't even have to do with the expensive price tag . So why one star ? Because although there is still about 75 % left in the main black in cartridge and my printer is configured for `` Use black ink only '' , once the printer got low/empty on the 3 colored inks , the printer would n't lay another drop of ink until they were replaced . I thought this was a trick only HP used , but I guess I was wrong . Seems like deceptive business practices to me .	-1
I can not understand why we need to re-invent the good old fashioned notebook binder . Although Pendaflex has produced some excellent office and home filing products , I do n't see a need for this.First of all , it 's not a real notebook where you can secure your messy paperwork . The premise is a binder with plastic inserts that will `` slide '' into the base of the binder for securing . The binder constructed of hard plastic and you have an inside pocket , however , the plastic pocket is not durable , therefore you can see it will tear soon . To attach the inserts , there are about 5-6 slots . The attachments are easy enough to dislodge from the binder if needed . There is a slot on the outside of the notebook for labeling.You will get an envelope with string attaching it closed . On the outside is a smaller pocket with a flap . This is hard plastic , not easy to get in and out of . Then you have another item that is geared to hold maybe flash drives , and cds . It includes two slots for CDs and two for smaller drives . Do students still use the CDs for transferring data ? Then you have the two secure file folders and they are geared for simply putting loose sheets into . A string secures the closure of these files . And , last there is a Clipboard , sturdy enough for its purpose . Note the contraption that holds the paper does not spring open like a normal clipboard . One can only `` slip in '' a paper , maybe two sheets at a time.I have used notebooks and discovered available pockets and doodads for carrying your smaller stuff . This is cumbersome , not comfortable . And I believe you will find that it wo n't work ! ! Again , I know at times we have reinvented the wheel , but why the notebook ? ... ... .Rizzo	-1
My first thought when I opened the box was , `` Wow . This looks nothing like its picture . '' The plastic notebook looked cheap , and I 'm not sure how long those inserts would last if used often . But that said , they hold materials well . Each binder can hold only so many inserts , unlike a 3-ring binder of the same width . Yet they are easy to insert and remove , and much quieter ( and with less hazards ) , but you have to ensure that the red tab is pushed in all the way or the inserts will fall out if the binder is ever dropped . Overall , I can not recommend this product , particularly at what I consider to be a very high price for a glorified plastic binder .	-1
When I saw this being offered I thought it would be a great way to organize my loose paperwork I have sitting on top of my desk . It seemed to have all the features one would need to get started . The kit includes:1 storage binder1 clipboard2 Secure File Folders1 Envelope1 Media FileUpon opening it I thought the system felt very cheap . The binder is flimsy to me . All the parts which are included above are all plastic and somewhat see through . I was disappointed to find they are not made well and seem like given time they will tear at the seams of the plastic . I thought the ` clip board ' was something that could not be messed up but the clip board included is very flimsy as well and I could not sit with it on my leg and write on it . I expected the whole system to be made a lot better.I would not use it for everyday tasks but it would come in handy if you have an interview and you need to tuck your resume away and have something to store all your paperwork that is needed for an interview . Other that that , I could not think of much use for it . I did like the fact that the ` envelope ' section has an area to place a pen into . Most units like this do not have that feature so I was impressed with that . Sadly , I think this is something someone will buy and use once and store away after a presentation or might use here and there . I do n't see it being used everyday as I mentioned above . Over all it is a great concept but I think the company made it too quickly with not putting much thought into the materials . I personally am not impressed and sadly would not recommend the system .	-1
Well this is probably a good idea in thought but the execution leaves something to be desired . For $ 30 I expected a lot more . I think there are already some good reviews on this that point out some great points most notably that there is not good place for a pad of paper and the clipboard is bsically a piece of junk . I think most people would be better off getting a three ring binder and buying inserts for that . In the long run it would be much cheaper also . Overall not impressed with this `` project management '' kit ... especially for the price .	-1
I 've read & re-read this product 's description and have taken the inserts in & out of the binder . I can not think of one good use , business or personal , that I 'd have for this thing.Is it an Organizer ? Sort of . There are inserts that allow you to store CDs , SDs and other objects . The inserts have different pockets and holders of varying sizes to hold stuff . The inserts that hold paper are interesting , but I 'm not too sure how practical they are ( 2 pieces of plastic , which are see-through , sandwich loose paper & then black elastic hold the plastic pages in place ) . The clipboard barely holds one piece of paper.Is it a Management System ? Sort of . It depends upon what you want to manage . If you want to manage items that these inserts are made for , then you are in luck . However , the 2-1/2 '' binder will only hold 8 inserts , so you wo n't be able to `` manage '' much.CONS:1 . This `` system '' binder is not a planner , nor is it something that you can combine with a planner into one notebook . Because the Pendaflex system has its own channel strip lock to hold its inserts , you can not insert anything ( other than into the front flap ) that is non Pendaflex.2 . This `` system '' binder is not low profile . The plastic binder has a 2-1/2 '' spine.3 . This `` system '' binder is made of hard plastic ( called Flex Poly ) . It is an attractive cover , but it is plastic nonetheless.PROS:1 . The `` system '' binder is attractive with kind of a industrial mesh look.2 . If this type of `` system '' binder fits your needs , then it may be a nice tool to have for your business.I would not purchase this system binder because ( 1 ) I do not have a use for this type of management system where there is not space for an actual paper presentation ( book format ) , ( 2 ) there are other inserts available for presentation binders that are more user friendly ( ie , you can insert CD pages , photo pages , and regular report pages that are printer printed ) , and ( 3 ) it is a large & bulky binder.If this `` system '' binder had a way to combine with a paper planning system & if the cover were not so `` plastic-y '' , I probably would change my rating and my feelings about the product . The way it is set up is too narrow with no way to get creative because of the proprietary locking system . Too bad .	-1
At first it seems like a good idea . A strong , durable , multi-function binder that can store CD/DVD , papers , and include the ability to add functionality with items such as a clipboard . Unfortunately this product is one of those that sounds good on paper , but fails in reality.The folder itself is large , about 2 inches in width . One horrible design 'feature , ' is their proprietary 'locking , ' mechanism . Not only are you forced to only use Pendaflex additions , but it is n't like a 3-ring binder where you can use paper thin dividers or just punch holes and attach documents . What is worse is for a 2 inch thick binder you can only add in 8 different sections . A large amount of space is taken up in the locking system itself . In other words , a large part of the bulk is from the actual binder lock , the rigid back of the folder , and design of the inserts.I understand the idea of keeping all related materials in one location for a project , but in today 's world that one thing is your laptop or PDA/Phone . It is hard to imagine this product having much utility because it tries to fill too many needs and does most of them poorly .	-1
This `` project system management '' kit is really just a slightly different take on other available products . I just was n't impressed when I opened it , especially given the high price tag . $ 30 retail is way too much for what is included here ( I wo n't list the items another reviewer has already done so ) and the `` binder '' itself is flimsy plastic . Regular ring binders or even snap binders and their myriad special inserts could do the same tasks for much less . Staples and Office Depot have similar organizers in faux leather for a comparable price to this ! And I agree with another reviewer that this is n't up to a large project without adding more insert materials at a substantial cost.Overall , this just is n't worth the money . For this price point , a customer may as well consider Levengers products which are exorbitantly priced but of very high quality .	-1
One reviewer said the binder was 3 inches thick and another said 2 1/2 , so I measured it , and got ... 2 3/4 inches . Anyway , it 's big for what it is . Takes up a lot of shelf space . That 's the first drawback , considering I ca n't see using it for any big projects.On the plus side , it 's an attractive-looking thing , with a textured design and a neat elastic closure . The label they include for you to write the name of your project on the binder could have been something more decent-looking , but whatever.The other plus is the locking system itself , which is just kind of cool . I feel modern and hip using it . Once you put a folder in , it certainly does feel secure , as opposed to folders in a 3-ring binder that can tear ( and reinforcements have proven useless on folders ) .But as for the actual usefulness of this system , I 'm just not sure . With only eight slots for folders ( each with different functions ) , you have to have a strong idea of exactly what you 're going to need for your project before you use it . You ca n't add to it beyond those eight folders.My `` I-Organize Envelope '' arrived with a permanent crease in its `` spine '' that causes it to remain distortedly open , and the clipboard is utterly useless . The clip does n't open and close -- you just have to attempt to jam a page or two of paper in there . But that 's all.I 'm not sure why the `` Secure File Folder '' was designed the way it was -- you have to open two sides of an elastic , then open the folder itself and page through whatever 's in there . I would think that the traditional type of folder ( where you thumb through things on top ) would have been a much more effective start , then the designer could have added an elastic or other security flap on top so things wo n't fall out.Beyond the first one , the folders wo n't lie flat well when the binder is open , either.But the main problem for me is that there 's no easy way to take notes here -- there certainly should be a way to integrate a pad of paper or a three-ring mini-binder , which would turn this from a showpiece into something actually useful . As it stands , all I can see here is something you 'd bring along to a meeting to impress somebody with how modern and organized you are . To me , it 's not worth that kind of space .	-1
I 'm crazy for file folders and neat organizational tools . I am disappointed in this pendaflex system though , as it does n't seem to be all that useful . Basically , it is a rather flimsy notebook which has several clear plastic inserts which can be added or removed by sliding them into the inner `` spine '' . The notebook has room for eight of these inserts , though my kit cam with only five : a clipboard , two open folders with elastics to hold the documents , a large envelope , and a pocketed media file . The page inserts tend to fall out , and the clipboard is flimsy and does n't actually have a `` clip '' that opens- you need to slide a sheet of paper under the clip .	-1
I am not overly impressed with this product . My first impression was that of cheaply made plasticky construction . For $ 30.00 I would hope for more in that regard.The unit also seems rather large and bulky for the amount of function I got out of it . I ended up using it to hold various electronics manuals and backup discs for my computer system . I did seem to have a cool way of holding folders in place , but I did n't need to use that for what I was doing with it . Getting items in and out of the various storage options is cumbersome and I felt i could do almost as well with a cardboard box . Honestly , I would look elsewhere if you had a large project to organize and needed to keep expanding your storage of related materials . Overcomplicated , bulky and cheaply made means I would have most likely asked for a refund if I had n't received this through the Vine program .	-1
You do n't get much for the money . The system is , well , its own standard . Which means it 'll disappear within a few months . Better off with a trapper-keeper marketed for the middle school crowd .	-1
I was hoping the Pendaflex I.Organize system would pack a little more of a punch , considering the way it 's described . Do n't be fooled , this is not a very high quality `` Project Management System . '' It 's functional if you have a small project you need to get organized , or if you just need to file some documents related to a specific purpose ( i.e . taxes , job ) . If you need it for any more than that , however , you 're going to be out of luck . It 's a rather flimsy binder , and the filing pages are n't much better . As for the so called `` clipboard , '' I 'm sure that if you have kids , you could find a higher quality clipboard somewhere in their toy box . In the end , if you have a few documents , notes , and/or CD 's you need to file away , this will function decent enough , but if you need it for more than that you should probably look elsewhere at higher quality filing systems .	-1
I expected a lot from the Pendaflex brand but it failed in execution.First , the slide and lock system works great but you are very limited to as to space- only 8 slots . For a two-inch binder , that does n't cut it for me . I need to be able to store a whole lot more than just eight sheets worth . And I 'm not going to waste the bookshelf space on a two inch binder that does n't hold much.The clipboard is too flimsy and small to hold a real pad of paper.The pocket space is great but there is no place to keep a pen.The price is far too steep for the cheap plastic of the binder .	-1
Firstly I need to say that I 'm a bit of a binder guru . I love them for everything . I 'm in college , so naturally I use them for my classes , but I also have to do many power point presentations for both my job and many of my classes . I always take in a binder that is specifically designed for that presentation , which I would guess is what this binder could be best used for . It has slots for discs , letters , and a clip board - but so what ? Any binder could provide those things , and the `` snap in '' locking system is just annoying , not particularly helpful at all . Additionally , it is CHEAP . They must have used the absolute cheapest materials to produce this , because it felt like the plastic was going to snap off just as I was sliding all the folders in.I would n't spend $ 5 on this , much less $ 30 . It provides no form of convenience and looks cheap and unprofessional . Stay away !	-1
The larger size of this lapdesk is perfect for my 17 '' laptop . I also find the zippered storage handy for occasional use cables . However , the big problem with this lapdesk is the lack of cushioning . The edges of the desk cut into my legs when it 's on my lap . It needs more stuffing in the cushions to be comfortable . I still use it , but I put a pillow under it .	-1
EDIT : I initially rated this lap desk at four stars but had to change my rating to two stars . After three months of use the desk plastic is cracked and falling apart.I have used a heat gun to measure the temperature of the bottom of my laptop - it reaches 158 degrees Fahrenheit at times . I bought the LapGear Jumbo LapDesk to keep my left leg from burning . It does a fine job of that . I took away a star because I was also hoping to use my wireless mouse with this product and it is not wide enough for a 17 '' laptop and mouse to go together on the board . It does an admirable job in regards to comfort and heat dissipation . The price also seemed reasonable to me . I do not use the pen pouches for anything .	-1
Really nothing positive to say about these pens . The ink does not flow smoothly off the pens , but rather sticks and scratches across the paper . It 's difficult to get the things writing - you have to do those scratching circles on paper to get them `` charged up '' - and even after they start , they often stop . Totally frustrating , like trying to drive a car that is falling apart piece by piece and just wants you to let it rest in peace . I gave these to my daughter and she got all excited about making some fun drawings with all the different colors - ten minutes after beginning her project , she said , `` Dad , these pens are no good , '' and got interested in something else .	-1
I am an artist and found that the ink did n't flow well when I tried to draw with these pens . I had to repeatedly stop and scribble on my hand or a scrap of paper to get them writing again . Other than that , they are nice looking and the set has an attractive variety of colors .	-1
As an educator I have seen many forms of math workbooks . This one does not pass for teaching mathematics . This workbook , Number Stories by Mead , is a `` learning numbers '' workbook . They cover writing numbers with fun little rhyms to help student remember how to form them , move forward into counting , and then have cut out manipulatives to use in the mathematical problem solving part . This book lacks the coverage of basic concepts such as adding on , why 5 = * * * * * , and completely skips addition , moving stright into abstract subtraction . Not a good mathematics program , but a good way to practice writing numbers and counting to 10 . I would recommend this one for preschool to kindergarten , certainly NOT first or second grade .	-1
Another ho-hum for pre-arithmetic.All the early writer number books I 've seen have these little stories to remember how to make the numbers . In every book I 've seen the stories are not helpful because they are little poems that take way longer to say than it takes to make the letters . Plus some of them are so sappy I 'm embarrassed even in front of a pre-schooler.The pages are kind of boring and have way too many repeats for the targeted age level . If you have a child that likes drill , maybe OK.All three of my children ( who have perhaps a 100 point IQ spread so this ca n't be about too hard or too easy ) would be in tears over this kind of assignment . ( Well not my middle one , she 'd just draw a different picture in each of the boxes ) I could be prejudiced about this because I happen to know the `` real '' number stories that I learned by , which are the right length and easy to remember . I just use them whatever method I buy.I 'd planned on listing them here , but it occurs to me that perhaps my mother made them up in which case she should write a book . I 'll get back to you on this .	-1
I realize this is for very young children . However , I do not believe they are as impoverished in imagination as this workbook would have one believe . Essentially the book uses very common words and pictures to spark the child 's imagination to form words and sentences . This is supposed to lead the child along the path to creative exposition in later grades . Most of the pictures have smiley faces , assuming that children do n't want to see any pictures which are n't heavily oriented in cartoons . I think the children could be given much more potentially imaginative images to spark their writing . I do n't think every image needs to be overly optimistic either . I also think popular cultural references are in order . These young children are far likelier to have seen headphones , for example , than a cow . There is nothing offensive to anyone in this workbook , which is about the only good thing I can say about it . I can not recommend this product .	-1
My 5 year old son who is already reading chapter books and writing VERY short stories did n't find this book very interesting . I thought it would be great but after seeing him with it maybe it 's not inspiring and exciting enough .	-1
Do n't buy this if you plan to keep it longer than a year and a half . I took very good care of it and used it rarely . It suddenly stopped working . This is a very cheap product .	-1
Make sure you realize that these labels include only one label per sheet ( about half the page ) , and the other half of the page is to be used as a paper receipt.But first ask yourself , do you really need a paper receipt for every label ? This is wasteful , not environmentally friendly , and will consume expensive printer ink . Why not keep an electronic record instead ? If you do , however , need a paper receipt consisting of half a page for every shipment , then this may be a good choice.However , due to the price tag , it might actually be less expensive to do multiple labels per page ( using a different product ) and then multiple receipts per page ( using standard printer paper ) .Personally , I use just regular printer paper for my labels and then Scotch tape to attach them to the package : - ) That way , I never have to worry about thick labels getting jammed in the printer and/or having to put different paper in the printer .	-1
Although the shredder seemed to be packed securely , there was a crack in the container that holds the paper . There were plastic fragments but none were completely cut out . Still , not impressive out of the box.The shredder comes in 3 pieces . The shred mechanism , the holder and a smaller holder that fits inside the larger to collect scraps from DVDs . The DVD shred holder is a nice touch for those of us who are going to recycle the shredded paper . There is also a plastic guard that keeps the shredded paper from escaping the holder . This is attached to the shredder itself.I agree that this is top heavy , as most shredders are . The collection container is short , the taller the container , the more top heavy this would be . At least it was designed right to avoid topples.I had the shredder on the automatic setting and shred for about 5 minutes . Placed 5 sheets in and it bogged down and jammed the shredder . Cleaned out the fragments and the shredder would no longer work . The motor was extremely hot . I let it cool down but the shredder would no longer function.There was also an odor while I was testing this out . It smelled like a new blender does when being used for the first time . A bit annoying but nothing unusual.I do recommend using the paper shredder portion for credit cards . The DVD portion leaves the pieces too large.Overall , I 'm not pleased considering that it was damaged out of the box and broke after 5 minutes of light use . Not a fan and I would not purchase or recommend this item .	-1
Opening is TOO SMALL for letter size envelopes . Really groans when placing maximum 5 sheets thru shredder . Top heavy and tips over easily .	-1
Looks so much bigger then it actually is when it arrived . I was not happy and was going to return it , but amazon told me just to keep it . I gave it away to someone that needed one since it did not meet my needs . Thanks Amazon	-1
I wanted this product to work . My printer was producing lines up and down the sides of each sheet . My best guess was that the rollers were dirty.These sheets are `` tacky '' on one side . In truth , they are n't very sticky . Each sheet has about a 1.5 '' margin around the sticky portion . When I pulled the backing off , I was disappointed that the sticky part did n't extend to the edge of the sheets.Anyway , I followed the instructions and put the sheet , sticky side up , in my printer 's paper tray . I ran the printer and ... the sheet crumpled and got stuck right where the paper makes its turn to come out of the top of the printer . So , it hit about half the rollers . I had to nearly take the whole printer apart to get the sheet out.In desperation , I tried opening the back of the printer and sending the sheets straight through the bottom half of the printer . This worked . Unfortunately , it just produced a sheet with the same lines and no cleaning effect . I repeated this with four more sheets . No success.I consider this purchase a TOTAL WASTER OF MONEY . The design of the sheet begs for failure for several reasons - the sticky is n't spread to the edges of the sheet and the sticky causes the sheet to jam in the printer.I know you want those blemishes cleaned from your printed pages but THIS WO N'T WORK . I do n't know what alternative I will try next but it might involve a professional repair . SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THAT.Good luck !	-1
I like that pads themselves . The quality is very good , and I appreciate that they are recycled . Unfortunately , I think this product is way too expensive . Right now , the price is over a dollar a pad , and they are n't even full-size pads . The pads in this set only have 75 sheets , compared to typical post it notes with 100 sheets per pad . The use of , most likely , chemical dyes offsets any environmental value . I say most likely because the packaging does n't mention the dying process , but I think it is fair to assume that if the dyes were environmentally friendly it would have been mentioned on the package . So , ultimately , you are not really benefiting the environment by using these , which makes it a waste of money .	-1
I have an MX860 Canon printer . I purchased these cartridges as a cheaper alternative to the expensive Canon cartridges . Even though the packaging states these cartridges are compatible with the MX860 these cartridges did not fit my MX860 printer , they did n't even come close to fitting it.If you have the MX860 Canon printer stick with the Canon cartridges , buying these would just be a waste of time and money .	-1
I work from home and I 'm a huge office items junkie ( I love buying folders , pushpins , paperclips , etc ) .I feel I can never have too many binders nor too many divider/sheet protectors , etc.That being said , this item was a huge fizzle.This does n't come with the little & # 34 ; write on & # 34 ; tabs that slide into the view tabs.For everyday binder use , I would n't recommend this.For one & # 34 ; knock your socks off presentation & # 34 ; perhaps- EXCEPT , a regular size copy paper 8 1/2 x 11 does n't fit into the title page holder.I find it 's just too much work when ( for me ) the old fashioned write on your own label dividers works really well - especially when I use my binders daily and flip back and forth .	-1
I give this 1-star because the chair is too small to fit the majority of adults ( and not documented as such ) . Plus it has poor adjustability and _no_ instructions on adjusting.I am 5'10 '' tall and this chair was much too small for me . I have had a number of visitors try it and the results are that a 5'0 '' woman loves it , but it is on the borderline for women 5'5 '' -5'6 '' which I assume results of different proportions ( legs , contours of back ) . All the men who tried it were 5'7 '' or taller and found it to be too small . You might check this range against the other reviews here , but at the time I last scanned other reviews , 5'5 '' was the tallest I saw for someone who liked the chair.The chair comes with absolutely _no_ instructions for adjusting the chair . Some adjustments are obvious , some not . The mechanism for adjusting the chair 's height is the conventional lever and works well . The levers for adjusting the arm rests are easy enough to find and operate.Adjusting the seat back -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -With experimentation , I determined that the seat back adjustment was a ratcheting system with 6 positions . Should you raise the back above that sixth position , you need to return it all the way to the bottom and start again.When I first got the chair , getting the mechanism to engage was not easy . Many times it took some jiggling and other fine movements to engage . And sometimes , I just was n't able to get it to engage , and had to start over from the bottom . However , as I asked visitors to try the chair to see who it might fit , the ratcheting mechanism got broken in , and adjustment became much easier : The positions were much easier to feel and hear ( the clicks went from muted to loud ) . My estimate is that the break-in involved cycling the back dozens of times.There was a related problem of the chair back staying in place . When I first got the chair , the slightest disturbance could cause it to drop to the bottom , for example , leaning forward or bumping it while walking by . However , the broken-in mechanism is much more robust in holding its position.On lack of instructions : During the early period , the only visitors that could figure out how to adjust the back were fellow engineers . For other people , the clues were too ambiguous for them to do the repetitions needed to get the back to stay in place.Tilt Adjustment -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -There is a knob under that chair that has left multiple other reviewers here perplexed . As best I can determine , it provides a _slight_ adjustment in the tilt of the seat.1 . Experimenting with the chair upside-down , I can see a slight movement . However , with someone sitting in the chair , she could n't sense any change.2 . The observed change occurred only during a tiny portion of the time I was turning the knob -- most of the time there seemed to be nothing happening.3 . I was unable to adjust the chair while sitting in it . While I could just reach the knob , I could n't get enough of a grip to effectively turn the knob . The 5'0 '' woman who liked the chair was unable to even reach it . If you are going to try this adjustment , you may have to have a friend lay on the floor and reach up to do the necessary turning.One other reviewer speculated that this knob adjusted the firmness of the seat , but my examination of the mechanism did n't find anything that would allow such.Other reviewers here stated that the height adjustment lever would also allow unlock the mechanism and allow you to tilt the chair back . I was unable to get their description to work , nor see the any part of the mechanism that would allow such . Consequently , I suspect that there are several slightly different mechanisms being shipped under the model number ( a single reviewer reported an additional lever that allowed forward/back adjustment of the seat pan ) .Other details -- -- -- -- -- -- -1 . The seat pan does not adjust . For 5'10 '' me , this leaves my legs feeling unsupported , like on a bar stool . There is a 6-inch gap between the front of the seat pan and the back of my calves.2 . The seat back does not adjust up enough to come even faintly close to matching the contour of _my_ back . My 5'0 '' visitor found the 2nd or 3rd position ( of 6 ) to be good for her.3 . The arm rests are hard plastic with a concave contour , but you can not adjust the angle . The contour presumes that you rest your arms straight forward rather than angling in . If you do the latter -- as most people do -- your arms will be uncomfortably on the ridge of that contour . Even if this was n't a problem , the arm rests may be mounted too far back to be supportive -- for me , half was behind my elbows . Most of the chair models I see have padded _convex_ armrests which provide comfort at many angles . The advantage of a concave contour is that it helps keep your arm on the rest , but for me that has never been an issue.4 . A petite person using this chair might find the arm rests too wide . The narrowest setting is 16-inches between the insides of the rests , a distance which was appropriate for me.5 . The one positive was that the chair assembled quickly and easily . For this , there was an instruction sheet : It told you to do the obvious -- take the large red cap off the shaft before inserting it into the obvious hole that it obviously would n't fit into if the cap were still on.6 . The shipping box says that it is to moved by two people , and it makes no accommodation to having to be handled by a lone person , such as the driver of a delivery truck or the person receiving it . The handholds common on similar large format boxes are not present , but since this is a Vine item , this may be the preliminary packaging and the production version may be better . Note : If you are small enough to fit in this chair , you are likely too small to be able to move this container by yourself.The packing of the components inside the box seemed adequate to protect them from the usual mishaps during shipping.In response of the obvious question about why write this much about a chair that is too small for me : My participation in the Vine program obligates me to write reviews of the products I receive. -- Douglas B.

Although this chair was extremely easy to assemble with no instructions but simple pictures , I was terribly disappointed in that the back of the chair can not be adjusted to lean back . I need to lean back at around 110 degrees and this particular Hon Ignition Chair will not lean back at all from it 's factory made position though it is advertised to have `` Tilt with tension control and tilt lock '' . If someone has figured out how to get it to tilt back , please let me know and I 'll gladly adjust this review . The height of the back can be adjusted by pulling up on the back of the chair , but that does nothing as far as lean . Also , the seat is way too short for long-legged people . I have long leg bones from my hips to my knees and the chair seat comes right at about half-way between . I feel as if I 'm about to fall forward , especially since I ca n't tilt it back . My legs get very tired after only a few minutes.I really worked with this chair trying to figure out how to get the back to lean backwards and have come to the disappointing conclusion that this model does n't offer that luxury . There is this big , black knob on the bottom that I turned and turned in both directions until it came to a stop , and despite mine and my husband 's efforts to see what it 's purpose was apparently there is n't any . I was hoping it was to adjust the lean of the back but it did nothing though we turned it as far as we could both ways , even while one of us sat in the chair leaning hard against the back trying to get it tilt . Absolutely NO instructions on how to use this chair comes with it . You are on your own to figure it out.It does have adjustable arm rests which can be adjusted for both height and width , and the chair raises and lowers very easily by depressing a lever underneath it . And the back height can be raised and lowered and clicks can be heard while doing so . The fabric is a deep , rich and durable black fabric , and it rolls around very easily . However , despite the lovely color , ease of assembly ( even the wheels were easy to insert into the base ) and rollability and ease of swivel , I ca n't use this chair . If you need a particular angle for your back ( as I do ) then I suggest this Hon chair : Hon Ignition Work Chair With Arrondi Carob Fabric Seat , as it is VERY adjustable and extremely comfortable . It costs more , but I can see why.Sorry I could n't rave about this chair , but if you are short , and like to sit straight up then this chair should be just right .	-1
This chair is n't very comfortable and it is n't designed very well . The back can be adjusted up and down , but it 's hard to adjust properly . If you pull it all the way to the top , that `` unlocks '' it and it slides all the way back down to the lowest setting . And if you grab the back of the chair to wheel it around , it 's very easy to accidentally change the height when you do n't mean to.It 's a stiff seat , and it wo n't accommodate tall people at all . I 'm only 5'7 '' and at its highest setting it 's barely high enough off the ground for me . It 's also not a deep seat . I feel like I 'm sitting on the edge of the seat because there 's not enough room to sit back any further . I recommend thebasyx by HON HVL531 Mesh Back Work Chair , Black . It is much more comfortable and much cheaper .	-1
I received this little set in pieces . The case was cracked and contents were hap-haphazardly in the box . Definitely a matter of you get what you pay for I think . I only needed one thing from it , if I were wanting the set I 'd have returned it .	-1
The Vtech base unit comes with a handset that has a port for a standard 2.5mm jack and comes with an attachable belt clip , both of which I have used on a daily basis with my old Uniden handsets . These new models do not have the 2.5mm jack and do not have Bluetooth so a headset can not be used with them . There is also no belt clip which the Vtech folks must figure with no headset no need for a belt clip , if someone 's hands are not free they can always walk around with the handset in their mouth.Vtech saved 5 cents by deleting these two capabilities and it was a dumb thing to do . At least with my cordless drills I can spend the money to special order a belt clip but in this case Vtech has not even provided the same case to permit attaching a belt clip which is an even dumber design decision as it means they have to have two different case molds to make two different case bottoms and have two different parts to schedule and inventory . Dumb all the way around .	-1
I wrote the same review for the black ink because it 's the same horrid product.I would n't mind the huge mess it makes if it actually did what it said it was supposed to do . After about a half hour refilling all my ink cartridges my ink levels still read low but more importantly the printing is all jacked up , faded , lines through the stuff I 'm printing and big black spots of ink where it looks like the ink cartridges went crazy . I 'd avoid this at all costs and more importantly to avoid the headache just buy the refills because this product is a waste of time and money .	-1
I was having trouble replacing the ink cartridge and left it loosely in the carriage . The machine decided to try to move the carriage from replacement position to somewhere else . Result : the carriage jammed under a ledge with the loose cartridge and shrieked like a tortured cat trying to move . The ink cartridge would not come out even after I got the carriage moved back to middle position . Then the whole carriage came lose because I pulled too hard on the ink cartridge . Machine is destroyed.Operator error ? A little , because I did not understand the incomplete ink cartridge replacement instructions that came with the machine . But the machine should be idiot proof enough to not try to move the carriage in that situation , completely without warning.It was a decent printer until then , though I had not used it much because it 's at a summer house . I 'm going to try to replace it with a more operator friendly product .	-1
This printer was designed for one purpose and one purpose only : to sell ridiculously overpriced ink . Wait till you see how tiny the ink reservoirs are , and how often the low-ink warning comes on for each of the five cartridges . It 's not as though Canon could not have squeezed a larger cartridge with a few more stinking milliters of ink into this 25-pound behemoth .	-1
Other than lousy photo printing , this printer has a real problem maintaining a wi-fi connection ; have done all the usual updated drivers , etc . It works then it does not work . Sometimes within minutes of working , it puts on Paused . Then I have to restart the printer which drains a bunch of ink as it cycles.Scanning works pretty well though . Probably all would be good tethered by USB ... but paid quite a bit for this functionality.Very disappointing .	-1
The title of this review says it all . I bought a MX870 at Costco after an older model Canon multifunction inkjet bit the dust after only 2 years of home use.The MX870 played nicely with my iMac and my Windows notebook PCs . I loved its features , including the wireless capability and auto duplexing . Print quality was - originally - very good . But things went downhill starting about 60 days after setup . Print quality became erratic , requiring multiple ink-gobbling runs of cleaning and alignment utilities , each time producing only temporary improvements.I finally boxed the MX870 up and took it back for a refund . At least I got my purchase price back . But in the 90 days I owned the MX870 , it went through a complete set of replacement ink cartridges , except for I think one of the four color cartridges . The second set of replacement cartridges was in the unit when it went back to the store , meaning I 'd bought two sets . Even at the bargain prices I paid for those two sets of cartridges , that was more than a hundred bucks worth of ink ! Since then I 've been making do with a cheap , lightweight , reliableCanon Pixma iP2600 Photo Inkjet Printer ( 2435B002 ) - which I 'd bought at a discount chain store for thirty dollars , and used to complete some word processing projects at the home of an older relative . For more serious document printing I 've purchased a ( B & W ; only ) Brother HL-5370DW Laser Printer with Wireless Networking and Duplex . I think I 'm done with multifunction inkjet printers , for good.EDITED to add , in response to a comment that I got 90 days from one set of cartridges so how is that so bad : I did n't get `` 90 days out of one set of ink . '' ALL the original cartridges were used up , and then the ENTIRE first set of replacement cartridges . That 's two sets right there . The third set was in the machine when I returned it to Costco , with the exception of one of the color cartridges . So it was more like 2.5 sets in 90 days . I was n't doing heavy-duty amounts of printing , either .	-1
Got an error on startup `` 6000 '' - had to call tech support because there 's no troubleshooting guide included to decode the error number . Machine was detecting packing material that had n't been removed ( it HAD all been removed ) . Cannon would have replaced it but they 're `` currently out of stock in this model . `` Just returned an HP with a fake paper jam error . Does ANYONE make a printer that actually works ?	-1
Not only does this printer not print borderless photos as claimed , it wo n't even print a photo on a single page unless it is manually sized to fit within the same printable area required by any printer , which is about 1/8-1/4 inch from each side.I am using Canon 's print driver , and the exact photo paper name listed by their driver . I have borderless printing selected , photo printing mode selected , and my photo is 4x6 inches . And yet when I print with the settings as per the instructions , it prints 1/4 of the image on each of 4 sheets of paper as if I want to try to cut them out and tape them together . The only way to get it printed on a single sheet is to crop it to 3.5x5.5 , or tell it to shrink to fit .	-1
I 'm normally a Canon printer fan ... but this unit is so loud that it is a distraction . Add that with its large footprint and the excessive ink use ... . well , that makes it a thumbs down . Not recommended .	-1
This heated/cooled footrest is a really interesting idea . I thought it would be great for my desk , because it seemed like a nice way to gently skirt my company 's `` no space heaters '' policy.So I 'll start with what makes this footrest completely unusable for me : it 's too tall for a guy my height.I 'm not a super tall guy -- just a tad over six feet tall . I currently have a footrest under my desk so that I can vary my posture throughout the day . I typically adjust my chair height once or twice a day just to mix things up and I sometimes use my footrest and sometimes do n't . I also apply pressure to the footrest to adjust the tilt . I do all of this to create a little variety for my posture and avoid sitting in the exact same position all day long.This strategy wo n't work for me with this footrest . First of all , this footrest is very tall . The motor , heater , and fan add bulk to the bottom of the footrest , so it stands at least an inch taller than the one I currently use ( which puts it almost 3 '' off the floor ) . Additionally , the angle does n't adjust easily . There are little legs that can be extended in the front and back ( kind of like the ones on the bottom of most keyboards ) . That 's helpful , but not as nice as a tension adjustment that can be tilted by just rocking the surface forward or backward.As for the cooling/heating mechanism itself ... It 's nice and not very loud , but it 's really underdone . The ventilated surface is too small to be very effective . Unless you keep your feet together , which most folks do n't , you can only heat/cool one foot at a time , which is pretty annoying.The power cord is also pretty short . You 'll need an extension cord if you do n't have an outlet within three feet of your feet.One thing they did right was to put the controls on the front surface of the footrest . There 's a rocker switch that most people can probably control with their foot to turn it on and off . Then there 's a three-position knob for switching from fan , to warm , to warmer . That 's nice , because most of us do n't want to have to crawl under the desk very often . I 'd hate to disturb all the dust bunnies under my desk by crawling around to turn the fan off and on.So this footrest is n't a winner for me . My wife tried it out and she seemed to think that it was more workable for her 5'7 '' body . We 'll see .	-1
I really was n't sure what to make of Climate Control Footrest . It 's CLEARLY designed to be put under your desk at work because the cord is simply not long enough to be used anywhere else . It has a nubby top but the unit does n't move so you 'd have to move your feet yourself to get any kind of massage effect . So how does the `` Climate Control '' work ? Well , first of all you have to take off any shoes and socks to feel the heating or cooling . Both the heating and cooling operate on a singlel fan so the temperature is most definitely not evenly distributed . You 'll end up cramming your feet up in the top center of the unit or in the case of the high heat setting on the edge to avoid the blistering heat.Given that this is summer time the cooling fan was more appropriate but it really does n't cool it just blows and as I said it 's not at all evenly distributed . I tried the heat but I imagine that if it 's cold enough that I want my feet warmed it 's probably so cold that I would n't want to take my shoes and socks off . I 'd have warm bottoms to my feet as the tops of my feet and my ankles suffer.I tried the footrest for a while but quickly got bored of it and feel no need to use it further . Besides the unreasonably short cord I also would have preferred an on off button that could be pressed with your foot rather than bending down under your desk to turn it off an on . This is the kind of item that inevitably makes it into a closet until someone decides to sell it for 50 cents at a garage sale .	-1
I was really eager to get this footrest unit under my desk and try it out . Admittedly , I have terrible posture . When I work at a desk all day , my body compresses in on itself leaving me with the most horrendous headaches . So any product that hints at relief is something that I 'm willing to try.However , I just do n't think I appreciate the advantages of the product . It is so high off the ground , it feels more awkward then I had anticipated . You can do some adjustments , with effort , on the angle and tilt -- but on height , you are stuck with the limitations of the product . I 'd have liked the unit to have some give so that my feet might be able to manipulate it into a more beneficial position -- but it 's a big process to make slight and barely noticeable changes . Trust me , it 's done nothing for my posture and I weary of it soon enough -- kicking it out of the way after a short while . The surface is hard plastic and not particularly comfortable if you take your shoes off . Looking at the picture , it appeared more rubberized ( hey , rubber with a little massage action , that sounds nice , maybe that 's what I want ! ) .And lastly , there is the heating and ventilation component . Listen , I do n't mind crawling on the ground to turn the settings but some might . The unit , itself , is plenty large enough -- but due to design , only the middle part is connected to the air flow . So to even take advantage of this , you must press your feet together in the center as opposed to sitting in your own comfort zone.An intriguing idea that suffers from fairly poor execution . While I may have gotten this product free to review , it is also something an idiot like me might have bought free and clear . I am the target market for these completely extraneous electronics , and I 'm afraid I just do n't get this one .	-1
Of course , the footrest is not very expensive , but even I thought it would last longer than a few uses . It is taller than one might think and I believe it got kicked more than it should . Nevertheless , the fan is the problem . It does n't work . I ca n't recommend this , sorry .	-1
Ok , I spend a lot of time at my computer both at work and home . Footrests help with lower back pain ( most people ) . What about a footrest with a fan ? The fan is mostly a gimmick . The unit I received pushed very little air so as to be of limited value in cooling off your feet . This appears to be a design problem since the fan is in the center of the footrest ( between the feet ) . However , the heat function worked as indicated though it smelled for the first few hours ( coated heating element ? ) . The footrest itself sits high off the ground with very minimal adjustments . The build quality seems very solid however and the nobby surface feels good if you take your shoes off.The major problem I have is that of other reviewers . I can not get my knees under the desk when using this footrest . Not sure if this is an issue with all footrests since this is my first try at using one . Even after a number of tries , it is awkward at best . I am only 5'11 '' so I am not sure why this is an issue.This might be a buy in the $ 15 range . At the current price , I would stay away .	-1
The object of this device is ergonomic relief -- in that realm it did n't work for me . I found it uncomfortable.As for the fan and so on , again I did n't find it useful . It got about a four-hour trial and then I pulled it from under the desk after my back began to tweak . A friend tried it with the same results.The quality seems okay -- I think its durability indicates that it would last a good while . So if it works for someone else then I suppose that 's a good thing.However , I ca n't recommend it .	-1
I am not crazy about this . It is n't horrible , but it is n't very useful either . It took a while for me to get my chair and the footrest adjusted for the most comfortable position . That is something you will have to do a lot as a woman unless you wear the same height of shoes everyday or if you only use it barefoot . I felt that my knees were too high regardless of what I did and I am only 5'8 '' . That is also a big problem if you share your computer . The cord is a bit short . That is irritating around computer equipment where you are trying to reach the surge protector . I barely felt the air . Even with my shoes off . That is my biggest problem , since that was supposed to be one of the best benefits . I would not recommend this and I would have returned it if I bought it .	-1
PLEASE do yourself a favor and do not buy this printer . I have had 4 for my home and my offices and this is NOT worth the effort to shlep it from the car to the desk . Sucks is all I can say ...	-1
I had this printer on a printer stand in the corner of my office for a few weeks . The wireless was working marvelously . This printer was working nicely churning out handful of documents a day for three weeks . Then , a few days ago a pop up came onto my screen letting me know there was an update available . I immediately downloaded the update and ran it . Sadly , it caused my printer to cease working from that point . The printer can not be found on the network . I 've tried different reentering the wireless key numerous times . I 've restarted the printer and the computer . I disconnected it for a day . I 've tried different locations in the house including next to the router . The problem actually extends beyond the wireless connectively as well.The printer also refuses to work on an ethernet connection to my router.At the suggestion of tech support , I checked my firewall and this printer is not being blocked either.I 've removed and reinstalled the printer drivers . I 've tried two ways to add the printer to the network as well . I tried through devices and printers , `` add device '' as well as through the Kodak AIO software.If anyone has suggestions that might work , or if you 've solved this problem , please let me know how . I 'll update if I ever get the wireless to work again.So , as a wireless printer I give this printer 1 star . As a wired printer , it works perfectly when connected to my computer by a standard USB printer cable ( borrowed from my other printer ) . I did have to reinstall the printer software , and I am happy overall with the print quality and ink cost.The scanner is very fast and I also like the fact that it has a card reader on the printer . The paper tray is great too , especially since it can store both photo paper and ream paper . I wish the photo tray could hold standard business size envelopes as an option , but it only has the ability for 4x6 or 5x7 photo paper.So , 2 stars for now because the wifi problems are a huge issue for me .	-1
I WAS TRULY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM . BEING OF SHORT STATURE , I HARDLY EVER FIND A CHAIR WHERE I CAN SIT WITH MY FEET FLAT ON THE GROUND SO I THOUGHT THIS WOULD COMPLETELY CHANGE THAT PROBLEM . WRONG ! IT 'S ACTUALLY UNCOMFORTABLE TRYING TO UTILIZE THIS FOOT ROCKER . MY BACK EVEN STARTED TO HURT AFTER JUST A SHORT TIME OF USE . MAYBE IT WAS A MISCONCEPTION ON MY PART BUT THIS ITEM DID NOT MAKE SITTING AT MY COMPUTER ANY MORE COMFORTABLE ... .RATHER WORSE . I 'LL TRY IT A FEW MORE TIMES SINCE THE IDEA OF IT IS GREAT BUT I SUSPECT I 'LL JUST END UP RECYCLING IT . IT MIGHT BE JUST ME BUT I CERTAINLY CAN NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE .	-1
For maybe 15 years I have been using the same footrest under my workstations . It 's the tube kind with the board covered in some kind of vinyl for traction . Maybe once or twice I tracked in some mud that got on the board . Tapping the board over a garbage can knocked off the dirt . Every once in a while , I vacuum the board while getting up the dust bunnies . So I am puzzled by the Microban Protection . I never touch the footrest with anything but the bottom of my shoes , other than the events previously mentioned . Why would anyone sane care about microbes on a footrest ? Or on the bottom of ones shoes for that matter ? I even sniffed at the old board , no moldy microbe smell.Next the rocking feature : As I write this review my feet are flexing back and forth . I feel like a teenager with too much energy . When I really need to flex my foot , I stick it out and rotate the ankle a few times . Rocking back and forth does not provide relief . I tried this as a footstool last night while watching TV . Nope , just another thing on the floor.At my home workstation we have a keyboard tray . Using this foot rocker under that desk was uncomfortable because even my short legs bumped against the tray . Here at work , the rocker inches away . Then when I use it again it bumps against the wall . Fortunately the person on the other side is away now . I know I would be annoyed at random thumping . The old footrest has rubber tubing that keeps it in place . This thing skitters around.Assembly : The box is easy to open . A minimum of packing material is used . The pieces are well protected . The instructions are simple drawings on box . You can figure it out with a moment or two of thought . However the tolerances are quite tight , which is a good thing once the contraption is assembled . I could not push the rocker into position bare-handed . Fortunately I had a 15 '' rubber mallet handy . A couple of taps and everything snapped into place.So if you are a nervous germaphobe who does n't worry about your rocker bumping against the wall , perhaps this is for you . And if it is , contact me and I will send you mine . I have no idea what I am going to do with this sample .	-1
I 've been using the foot rocker for a few weeks now . It generally works ; however , the assembly of the `` plate , '' which is made of more than one plastic/resin part , makes it creak and groan.The unit comes in a flat box and is simple to assemble . The two elliptical pieces slide onto the ends and then slide back to lock in place . There are cosmetic caps that snap on those ends once they are in place . In all , that gives a good , finished appearance.Because the plate is n't in the vertical center of the elliptical ends , you can choose one of two heights by turning the unit over . The lower height works better for me as the higher one makes my thighs hit the bottom of my desk if I rock my feet . This is a nice feature that allows some basic customization.The big turnoff here is that resting my feet on the plate causes it to make creaking or groaning noises , especially if I start rocking it . This is n't a function of the elliptical ends and their connection . Rather , it occurs because the plate itself is n't a single solid piece . It is a hollow piece made of a separate top and bottom that are fastened together internally somehow . You can see the seam between the top and bottom around the edges of the plate . As a result , when I put any weight on the plate , noise comes from within it as the plastic/resin shifts slightly . It 's distracting and irritating , sort of like a creaky dashboard in a car . I ca n't say that I think the plate is well designed . It would have been better to make it of a single piece.And that 's too bad because the unit does make sitting for prolonged periods at the desk more comfortable . In all , I think Fellowes has a good idea here , but they need to do a better job engineering the unit to make it silent . No one wants distracting noises in the workplace .	-1
I lasted about 5 minutes with this foot rocker . I suppose it offers some relief for some people , hence the 2-star , but it just does n't fit into my life . It works best as a foot toy ... as in it is something to move and creak when you are sitting still for long periods of time . I will mention I have long legs ... maybe it works better with people of average size .	-1
Ok , so I 'm glad to know I 'm not the onloy guy who could n't figure this out . I am very good at following directions , but this one did n't come with any . Sure , I can follow a IKEA like pictures to get you to assemble . However , this was not easy . My legs would n't lock and the `` caps '' to make it look finished did n't work either.As far as the concept , it 's a smart idea to keep moving your legs when you sit all day . Would I recommend this ? Yes , but maybe a similar design from a competitor .	-1
While it was easy for me to figure out how to put this together , I ca n't use it . Regarding putting it together , you just have to bang the sides in place or put your weight on it hard.The reason I do n't like this foot rocker is the two sides prevent me from using it unless my feet are together parallel AT ALL TIMES . I have two other foot rockers that are purely flat on top , so you can manuever your feet around a lot.The edges make me have to keep my feet inside . I ca n't stand to be so confined . You do n't want this one even if it 's a lot cheaper than alternatives . Get one without those terrible ridges on the sides and one that is wider . It 's not natural to sit with one 's feet tightly together for a prolonged period .	-1
Fellowes has recently been pushing their full range of ergonomic products . They claim that the foot rocker helps reduce leg pressure , improve circulation , and reduce fatigue . The problem with most ergonomic products is that while they are designed to help avoid or relieve a variety of office space ailments , they are often over-priced , inconvenient , or do n't work . They sometimes even make things worse . The challenge is to make an ergonomic product that actually does what it says , is affordable , and is convenient to use so that the user will continue to use it . How does the Fellowes Foot Rocker fare ? PROS- Reasonably priced- Antimicrobial protectionCONS : - Very difficult to put together- Annoying squeaking noise when in use- Large size gets in the way- Did n't help me , personallyWhile the MSRP of the Fellowes Foot Rocker is pretty high , Amazon.com 's price is actually very reasonable for a foot rest/rocker . Unfortunately , the reasonable price and the antimicrobial protection were the only positives I could find . Putting the rocker together was way too difficult . Figuring out how to attach the sides was an exercise is primal instincts . From the diagram provided , it should have been as easy as just sliding the sides in and locking them in place . I seriously stared at the sides and the diagram for about 15 minutes , wondering why the sides would n't slide in all the way . I finally lost my patience and slammed the sides against a door frame and got them in . Braun beats brain , 1-0 . I am just amazed at how difficult Fellowes made the rocker assembly . A huge fail.Once I finally got it assembled , I threw it under my desk and started working right away . It did n't take me long to figure out that I was annoyed with it being there . I exercised as much patience as I could -- about a day and a half -- before I gave up on it . First of all , it squeaked each time I rocked it back and forth . Maybe it was the squeaking that wore on me but by the time I gave up , I really wanted to toss it out the window . Also , while I think footrests are a good idea in general , I did n't feel the rocker helped me at all . To top it off , I found it too large and cumbersome to have underneath my desk . When I went to put my chair in under my desk , the rocker got in the way or moved so when I came back to use it , I 'd have to crawl under my desk to position it again.I do n't know why office ergonomics has n't improved much over the years , but it 's a huge problem that I think a lot of us will only realize after it 's too late . The amount of time that we are spending at our desks in front of computers is unprecedented . While I appreciate a well-known company like Fellowes offering an entire line of ergonomic products , I feel that they still have a lot of work to do . The Fellowes Foot Rocker is n't something I would put on an ergonomic essentials list and I ca n't recommend you do either .	-1
First of all what should have been a simple build was a pain . There is litterally 5 pieces to this thing and I still have not figured out how to put the leg covers on . Due to this fact , the legs frequently come off.Secondly , I just honestly see nothing special about this thing . It does n't really offer anymore comfort and the thing is poorly made . I hate it.Lastly , just dont buy it . There are plenty of better foot rests out there I 'm sure .	-1
I like the rocking action on this foot rest , but it squeaks terribly when you rock it . And even when I do NOT rock my feet on it , it still slides across the chair mat that I use to protect my hardwood floors . It makes it unusable for my situation . It slowly slides across the floor with even the slightest pressure . If you have carpets , this may be a good product for you . Otherwise , I would suggest looking elsewhere .	-1
I selected this product because I thought it would be a nice foot rest / foot rocker and massaging platform for restless feet . I also thought the ridges on the rocking platform would feel soothing on my bare feet . However , for me it 's too low to the floor to feel confortable or useful for my purposes and the ridges are not `` massaging enough '' to have any impact on my tired soles . On the other hand , Fellowes never claimed this was supposed to massage your feet but they do claim it can be used to reduce foot fatigue , which it did n't in me.PROS : - Extremely easy assembly except for the locking mechanism on the rocker wheels- Sturdy enough for a small child to stand on ( although I would n't recommend this ) CONS : - Too low to ground for my use- Creaks when you rock it- Almost impossible to lock the two rocker `` wheels '' in place -- I actually had to bang them on the floor- The ridges on the rocking platform are too smooth to massage bare feetThis foot rocker is n't for me so I 'm going to pass it on to my boyfriend and will update this review with how he likes it.June 11 , 2011 UPDATE -- - > My boyfriend rated this a 5 and said the squeaking does n't bother him . Here 's a quote from him `` I like it for what it is . A great idea that followed through to a good product . Simple durable and priced right . When I sit in the chair I find myself looking for it . That is the only evidence one needs . ''	-1
Ay Carumba ! I have -never- had any difficulty putting things together . I 've assembled many rooms of IKEA furniture , built a playroom with the husband , and installed the bathroom fixtures alone . I never , ever thought I 'd be unable to assemble a little rocking thing with five pieces ! Geez , my kid 's playhouse was easier to assemble , and everyone knows how fun it is to put together kids ' toys ! It 's too bad , because I was very excited about this gizmo , because there is no one who has more excess energy than I do , and I 'd have liked to burn it off in a way that would give me a little exercise . Keep me off the treadmill for a few minutes a day or something . But since the item is sitting here in pieces , and the only instructions are rough pictograph on the back of the box , I doubt I 'm going to get any further . The pieces appear warped , and do n't line up at all.So , unless you are amazing about putting things together without instructions that do n't fit together , I 'm going to have to advise you skip this one .	-1
Like many others , I could n't really assemble this . The instructions were n't intuitive ( and I 'm a veteran Ikea furniture builder , so it 's not like I ca n't assemble stuff ) . I was n't able to get the feet to slide down to lock into place . It 's not a huge issue since they 're on so tight they do n't budge.I tried taking them off , thinking maybe I was putting them on wrong , but I could n't get them off . So there they stay . It works fine , but it definitely looks unfinished . Update : After a while , the legs fell off . Repeatedly and annoyingly . Finally , after three years , the feet managed to lock in place . The constant falling off was annoying enough that I knocked a star off my review.I 'm short ( 5'4 '' ) , and I find it to be just a smidge on the low side even when I have on the high side . It 's functional , but not ideal . I do like the rocking motion -- it gives me an outlet for my fidgeting.I 'm reviewing this for Vine , so I got it for free . I always ask myself when doing Vine reviews , would I pay for this product ? And I think in this case , the answer is , yes , but not what they 're charging -- maybe half that .	-1
I was seduced by this product by two elements . Firstly I have lower back from two auto accidents and am always look for a way to correct my posture from head all the way to my toes in order to ameliorate this issue . Secondly I have a desk job so I felt this product would aid me to relieve pressure in my legs , keep my circulation going and aid in addressing element number one , my back.Well I have to say this is one of the biggest piece of garbage I have ever used . This unit is only five pieces , five pieces , FIVE and it is next to impossible to assemble . I put a treadmill together that was like seven hundred pieces and it was easier than this thing . I was able to slide the wheels on the board , but was n't able to snap roller rocks in place . I did everything , I flipped the wheels , switched the wheels , put the roller rocks on first , put the roller rocks on last and this was after I read the short but `` claimed '' simple instructions . I even had two other people take a crack at it , they had no luck either.So I figured whatever this product could be used without the locks . I was half right on this former statement . After about fifteen minutes of use the wheels become loose and fall off , lovely . I did manage to use this product despite the handicap and really did n't find any improvement in my leg circulation or back pain . Perhaps my unit was a lemon , I do n't know but I would not recommend this product . There are plenty other ergonomic products out there that have to be better than this drivel .	-1
got this on a whim , and well ... it 's just a hunk of plastic collecting dust.it 's not strong enough to stand on , and it just feel awkward trying to rock your feet on it from under the computer desk . others may have liked it , but for me it 's not of any use because it 's awkward to use .	-1
The colors looked vibrant on the package , but only the blue and pink worked well enough to be seen from a distance in my classroom . I would not buy these again .	-1
These markers appeared in my office one day and I tried them out on my white board right away . * How they look on the white board : The pink is the most visible color with orange in second place . The blue , green and especially the yellow not nearly as bold . The blue , green and yellow also seem to be negatively impacted by the viewing angle and how the florescent light hits the board . Depending on your seat the room and your angle to the board , the color can appear boldly neon or washed out and almost impossible to see . * How they look on the white board - Part 2 : The markers I tried had a `` Bullet Tip '' . The fine tip is great for writing very small text , but not so good if you want a room full of people to see what you are writing . Even if you tilt the marker at an angle you still ca n't get a wider line of color . But writing on an angle does give you bolder , denser colored lines when compared to lines drawn with the marker held straight . * How they erase : Honestly it takes a lot more effort to erase the neon color than the regular Expo colors . The regular color erases with just a gentle swipe , but to get rid of the neon markings you need to SCRUB . * Finger erase : I do n't know about you but when I make a little mistake with the marker I just swipe it away with my finger tip instead of reaching for the eraser . This method works fine with the regular colors ( non-neon ) , but when I do this with the neon colors it leave a BIG smudge . * Ease of opening : The caps of the markers are really snug and take a lot of effort to pull them off and snap them back on . But possibly they will loosen up after use.So all-in-all I 'm not too wow-ed by these markers . I use them to draw circles around importing topics , or accent things with stars & arrows , but for my normal writing or diagrams I use the regular ( non-neon ) colors .	-1
The erasers are good quality and work very well but the holder is crap . The eraser will not extend without pushing it out with a pencil and they slide back into the holder while you are using them .	-1
This sharpener does not sharpen well . The point you will get is not what this product is supposedly designed to deliver with its `` titanium blades '' I have had better results with an old fashion sharpener ! If you want to get a decent point in your pencils you have to apply way too much force . Unfortunately , this leads to the sharpener to stop , forcing you to take the pencil out and reinsert it again to resume sharpening . Not convenient at all.The design looks very nice but the performance is far from acceptable .	-1
This product does sharpen pencils , but not as good as a higher priced sharpener . I tried a few regular pencils and it sharpens them ok . It only takes a few seconds to sharpen a pencil . I found it almost perfect for colored pencils , which you do n't really want to be super sharp ( you still have to dull the point a little ) . The product is pretty cute on the desk and the design is perfect for space saving . It 's also quieter than my industrial strength pencil sharpener . This would be an ok product if you do n't have much desk space .	-1
So , lets get this out of the way first , this is a pencil sharpener . Shock , I know.But , it 's a pencil sharpener that if you read the description it uses all the fancy words to make it sound like it is the space shuttle of pencil sharpeners . It even looks cool ! So , once you get this and finally solve the puzzle of actually opening up the packaging ( stupid clam shell plastic ) . You are greeted with a nice sleek looking pencil sharpener . However , once you start using it , you realize that all the fancy words and sleek look do n't matter if it is adequate at best in doing what it is designed to do.While it claims to be a sharpener , I would classify it more as a pencil grinder . It does n't seem like it actually sharpens a pencil it just grinds it down into a cone shape and hopes the lead is exposed.After using this on a couple different pencils and getting the same result on each of them , I put this in a box and into the closet and resumed using my old one . If you 're in the market for a good pencil sharpened then you would probably be better off looking at a different one . This one just does n't hold it 's weight to others .	-1
A common problem that pencil sharpeners create is lopsided sharpening , and this one is no different . It 's chews half of your pencil away only to leave you a sharp point that is off center , so the lead is only partly exposed . Big , cumbersome , loud , and uneven . Better for making skewers for the grill than sharpening pencils . Pass on this one .	-1
Space saving , yes , but so-so because the well for shavings is too small . You really do n't want to empty that messy thing too often . Also , shavings removal is not spill proof enough .	-1
Looks nice but sadly it just does n't sharpen very well . While I knew it was electric when I got the item , it simply added one more plug in item I did n't need on my desk . Have a $ 10 battery operated sharpener that does a great job , so this new sharpener for shy $ 30 is not worth the price .	-1
... at eating pencils . It 's also good looking as it sits there on the desk , waiting to eat pencils.But when it comes to sharpening pencils , well , not so good . It tends not to sharpen pencils to as sharp a point as my persnickety self requires . But even more important , it does n't sharpen evenly . On one side of the pencil , the wood will be nicely whittled away , exposing the lead , but on the other side , the wood extends too far down . This results in a pencil that has to be resharpened frequently . As a result , this expensive device spends more time eating pencils than sharpening them.But it sure does look mighty sharp .	-1
This is one of two sharpeners I own , the other beingStanley Bostitch QuietSharp Glow Classroom Electric Pencil Sharpener ( EPS11HC ) . And I have to say , I was disappointed . Based on the marketing I expected my pencils to be quickly sharpened to sharp points and the actual experience struck me as being no different ( better or worse ) than an average , inexpensive sharpener . I still get a lot of broken tips and points that are n't entirely sharp . Personally I would pass on this one as I do n't think for the price point it offers a better sharpening experience than more inexpensive sharpeners on the market .	-1
I 've always used hand sharpeners so wanted to try an electric one . You put the pencil in the hole in the top of the sharpener and then push down lightly while keeping the pencil from moving . I used this to sharpen 3 new pencils and a pencil that the tip was broken off of . This sharpener is supposed to automatically turn off when the tip is sharpened . I 'm not sure how it decided that . All 3 of the new pencils stopped sharpening when the graphite was n't even showing yet . I had to apply more pressure to get it to start again and had to do this about 3 more times to finally get the graphite exposed . None of them were sharpened evenly . There was more graphite showing on one side and little on another but I could n't get it to sharpen anymore so had to use the hand sharpener . The pencil with the tip broken off sharpened with less attempts than the new ones but stopped short of having a pointed tip . I had to finish that one with the manual sharpener as well . Does n't make any sense to have if you have to use the manual one to finish the job . There is a ring at the top of the device that you turn to open and shake out the shavings . There were a lot of shavings stuck to the blades that have to be removed with a cloth . It is hard to get all the shavings off due to the positioning of the blades in the device . All in all , the manual sharpener I have works much better and is much easier to clean .	-1
So , this is marketed as being a sleek , modern pencil sharpener . Always be suspicious when a product that serves one specific function is touted for its `` prettiness '' ... when aesthetics have no bearing on its function.Getting down to it : This lightweight , electric pencil sharpener simply refuses to put an even point on a pencil.No matter how I position the pencil inside this gizmo , the lead is always exposed off-center.Sometimes , so off-center that the wood gets sharpened to a point , blocking the lead . Honestly , it should n't be this difficult to make a pencil sharpener that does its job . I have a 30-year old , manual crank pencil sharpener in my garage that does a better job . But , since that one is screwed down onto a workbench , it is n't exactly portable.I 'm not really looking for the `` perfect '' pencil sharpener , but I 'll settle for adequate . And this one just is n't .	-1
Absolute disappointment . The unit itself is nice & sleek looking , but I inserted an unsharpened pencil , it took a fewrotations , then died , just mere minutes out of the box . I keep trying it to use it every once in a while , and still , dead , almost 1 month later .	-1
I have finally achieved the exalted state of Yuppiedom with my sleek , streamlined iPoint ( elegant ) Electric pencil sharpener.When I first compared this space-aged capsule to my old pencil sharpener with a handle that tuned and that I attached to a wall , or the small multicolored plastic ones that could fit in the palm of my hand , I shivered with delight.And then I plugged it in and stuck a dull pencil in the hole.It felt tingly when I bore down as the pencil turned slowly in my hand.It was only after I examined the still dull pencil point that I realized I was supposed to hold the pencil firmly , and not let it turn . ( Duh me . I 'm new to such yuppie devices . ) This time I held the pencil fast and let the ultra new iPoint Evolution blades rotate around the pencil , and waited for the sharpener to stop automatically when it had done its job.But it didn't.It did half a job.It did not remove the wood from one side of the pencil.I tried again.The same thing happened.I blamed the pencil for some inherent invisible defect.I tried with another.The same thing happened.I rooted around for my old 10 cent sharpener and finished the job.The old fashioned way.The way that was n't yuppie , but the way that worked .	-1
As a teacher , I am constantly in need of sharpened pencils so being able to review the Westcott iPoint Evolution Electric Pencil Sharpener was a dream come true.The sharpener is designed ergonomically and takes up very little room . It is designed for the pencil to be sharpened from the top instead of the side and HAD the pencil sharpener had enough power to sharpen a pencil , things would have been different with this review.That said , it took FOREVER to sharpen a pencil . Sharpening colored pencils was non existent almost and after ten pencils , both colored and regular , the sharpener overheated . It then took more than an hour to work again . So , to me , this sharpener is a waste of money.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine	-1
I wanted to like this Westcott iPoint Evolution electric pencil sharpener because it does have a solid design and looks like it should function better than most other sharpeners . The problem is , it does n't . I tried two different types of pencils , both number 2 , and in both cases the point was not as sharp as I 'm used to getting with my other electric sharpener or my manual sharpener . I also have to agree with the excess wood by the tip being a problem that I 've found unique to this sharpener . I tried several brand new pencils , and tried them several times to see if I could perfect a solution to get a quality sharpening , but I failed miserably . Maybe it 's user error , but this is n't my first rodeo working with pencil sharpeners so I highly doubt it.In the end , this will probably sit unused for a while because I have two other sharpeners that I know do a quality job each time I use them . Disappointing and overpriced , two stars only because it looks pretty and technically does `` work '' ( just not nearly as good as it should ) .	-1
This is a stylish and compact unit . I liked how it looked in my classroom and my students were immediately attracted to it . While it worked , it was very quick ; it sharpened pencils in just about the blink of an eye . One simply pushed the pencil into the top until the sharpener began to sharpen . Also , the top screwed off and the shavings container lifted off for easy cleaning.Unfortunately , the sharpener broke in less than two weeks of moderate use . When pushing a pencil into the unit , it would just spin without sharpening the pencil . With nothing to lose , I opened the unit and discovered what had happened : the manufacturer uses plastic gears and the teeth of one of the gears were chipped off . The motor would spin but the cutter head would not engage . Bad news , especially since this sharpener was so quick to sharpen . Reading the description of the sharpener , the manufacturer noted the tough cutting head ; unfortunately , they forgot to mention that the gearing is fragile plastic . Had the gears been metal ( even pot metal ) , the sharpener would still be alive and kicking in my classroom.If you want a sharpener for very light use , this will probably be O.K . I would not recommend this sharpener for classroom use .	-1
This pencil sharpener looks great and is easy to hold with one hand while the other is sharpening a pencil . I liked the fact that you could remove the cable from the base of the unit rather than have to bring the whole thing , cord and all , to the trash can to empty.I pushed at least 50 pencils into this thing to test it , and it does n't seem to be able to adjust for different sized pencil widths . It also kept sharpening a good few pencils way past the time needed to get them sharpened , thereby wasting a lot of wood -- save the trees and all that . Some pencils came out looking like they could have been put on the end of the Wicked Witch of the West 's nail tips and killed a few Dorothys , but most of them had an uneven shave and the wood came up to the very tip of the lead on one side.The worst part about this sharpener is that the top is insanely difficult to get off , and rather than break it I had to look at about 5 different websites before I could figure out how to open the darn thing.This may have won the design award but it 's much like a dumb blonde -- great to look at but not much to offer in any other department . Save your money and get something else .	-1
I was excited to try this sharpener out because I know the teachers at my children 's school need good pencil sharpeners all the time.I decided to compare it to the old school , classic 1980s era sharpener that I found at a thrift store . The classic one I have never breaks , never jams , and always gives me good performance.The selling points according to the package are `` Titanium bonded blades '' , `` auto sensor shut-off '' , `` striking vertical design '' , and `` ez-view reservoir '' . I do n't actually care for the auto sensor shut off and really do n't care about a striking vertical design.I sharpened 8 pencils with each sharpener . The iPoint Evolution sharpener took an average of 5 seconds to sharpen each pencil . The old school classic sharpener took an average of 3 seconds.The one thing that really concerned me about the iPoint Evolution sharpener was that it sharpens pencils at a steeper angle than the old one , so sometimes the wood around the lead interferes with lead access . The old school classic has a more shallow angle , so the sharpened edge is almost a centimeter longer from beginning of sharpened area to the pencil point . This means that rarely do you have issues with wood interfering with the lead . I assume the shorter point is cheaper to manufacture.Bottom line : Do n't buy this sharpener- look at a thrift store for a really good old one , with the fake wood sticker look on the outside . If you must buy a new sharpener , this one will be ok but not great . Frustrations will be involved.EDIT : After three weeks in a first grade classroom , this pencil sharpener no longer works .	-1
This sleek design does save space on your desk . And it DOES sharpen the pencils , but I feel that it 's lacking in how it sharpens them . It leaves lots of wood around the graphite of the pencil . In fact , the first couple times I sharpened pencils using this sharpener , I did n't think it was sharpening them at all , but it WAS , it just does n't look like they 're sharp ! On a couple pencils , the wood goes down almost to the pencil point itself ! Also , the points are all the same ( since it has the autostop feature , perhaps ) , and they are n't as sharp as some people would prefer . I would prefer more of the graphite part showing , and less wood , but after playing around with the sharpener some more , that does n't seem to be an option . The pencil points are just too short ! I think I will be going back to my Boston electric pencil sharpener , which takes up more room , but sharpens pencils more to my liking !	-1
I tend to try to be optimistic , and even though I had read some other reviews of this pencil sharpener I hoped that maybe the other reviewers had just gotten a bad one . However , I found the exact same issue with mine . When you sharpen a pencil , no matter how you hold/twist/whatever the pencil , the sharpener leaves a piece of wood almost all the way up the tip . ( In one case it was all the way to the tip . ) This would require frequent re-sharpenings to keep the pencil usable . When I see one negative review on a product I tend to think it is either `` user-error '' or a `` bad apple '' in the batch , but when multiple people consistently report the same issue I tend to think that it 's the product . I 'm leaning towards a design flaw in this case . I went with two stars because it is usable . If you keep it right on your desk within reach of where you work it is probably not even an issue , but even with something as simple as a pencil sharpener , I expect more than what this product delivered so no more than two . If you buy , I hope that you have better luck than I did ( maybe this batch just has a lot of bad apples ) and thanks for taking the time to read my review .	-1
Threw away on first use . The eraser does n't work as well as others we have , after multiple passes the ink was still present . We finished up with our own eraser and sprayed the cleaner on the board . Immediately my younger child , who has asthma , began wheezing badly . We had to take her outside of the house because she could not remain inside without convulsive coughing . The smell of the cleaner also bothered my spouse . We bagged up the cleaner and soft cloth we 'd been using and aired out the house . While the markers have a good color and the odor is tolerable , the cleaner was completely useless for us . If you have anyone with breathing issues in the home I would avoid this product .	-1
I wanted to hang a very light weight plastic video camera in a store that I own , and I wanted it to be removable.I got my wish on the removable part . Unfortunately , the fastening material is much stronger than the glue . The concept of these fasteners is a good one , but they are flawed due to a fundamental paradox . If the glue is strong enough to hold , then the fastener wo n't be removable . If the glue is n't strong enough to hold then the fastener wo n't be successful.These probably work to hold up a poster on the right surface . I really want them to work , but they do n't .	-1
As apparently has happened to at least a couple of other folks here , my pens do n't work at all well and have turned out to be very dissappointing . The pens had some sort of goop on the tip of each when opened which was removed with some work.I finally got each one to write , but in both cases , the pens skip at times , drag as if something is between the pen and the paper , and do n't write well or even poorly . I do n't know if my set is defective or not . I just know they do n't work as advertised for me.I do n't recommend them at all .	-1
I did n't care for this product because it does n't use standard post it notes . You have to buy pop-ups and I do n't use them . I have a zillion regular post it notes though and I ordered it thinking those would work in there.You also have to pull the note out of the dispenser before you write on it which I found irritating and inconvenient . I like to write a note as I think about it so having something mounted to the wall and not being able to write on it ( like a dry erase pad for example ) does n't help me.If I 'm using a post it note , it 's because I had a sudden idea that I had to remember and in the time for me to pull it out of the container and grab the pen , I 've forgotten why I wanted to write something down.I was really disappointed in this product and wo n't be using it in the future .	-1
POST-it Pop-up Note with dispenser is poorly engineered . Every time I went to pull one out , I 'd get two or three and sometimes more . Not worth the aggravation .	-1
I got this thinking the post-its would somehow be easy to get out of the dispenser , or that I could write on them while attached to the dispenser , then pull it free . Nope . They are connected and they come out the side , which is inconvenient enough , but they are really hard to separate . I 've put this aside and am no longer using it - too much hassle .	-1
The Post-it Pop-up Notes Dispenser , 3 x 3 Inch , sticky notes dispenser is a great idea . Grand idea actually . But there is one flaw . Unless you stick it to a wall , drawer , desk , file cabinet , chalkboard , etc , the dispenser falls over and then it becomes not an easy to use office tool , but one that you have to keep fixing . Also , the spot for ink pens is too short and they fall over and out of the spot very easily . I was completely disapointed in this notes dispenser and I really wanted to like it.I also was n't fond of the colors . Ink written on royal blue and hot pink is hard to read t the best of times and so I would love for the notes that come with this dispenser to come in either yellow or white.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine	-1
I received two of these Post-it note pop up holders . Personally I did n't like the colors at all . They both had a white front half , but the back half was either neon pink or robin 's egg blue . The paper matched the colored back side . The hole in which to put a pen or pencil is two inches tall and big enough to hold any pen , pencil , or a sharpie marker . The units come with four strips of adhesive which has velcro like catches on the side opposite the adhesive in order to hang the Post-it holders on a flat vertical surface . The dispensing unit does not lend itself to be able to write anything on the Post-it without pulling the Post-it out of the dispensing unit and then placing the note on a flat surface in order to write . I would have rather had a unit that had a flat tabletop orientation which could be written on and an upright pen holder . I definitely wo n't stick these obnoxious colored units anywhere in my home . I would preferr to have a more neutral dispenser as well as neutral colored post it pad . The idea of sticking a Post-it on a vertical surface , but then needing a flat surface in order to write on the note seems silly . This unit can be placed on a tabletop surface , but it has a flat slippery plastic bottom so you need two free hands ; one to hold the unit and one to pull off a post it note . I 'm not sure why the company thought this would be a good idea . Other than a work environment who would want to stick something up on a surface in their home ? The other reason I 'm not over joyed with this product is I prefer to use scraps of paper ( second use/reuse ) whenever possible and Post-it notes seem like a very unnecessary waste of natural resources . Reduce , reuse , recycle !	-1
This is a good idea . You can stand it on your desk , or stick it to your computer tower . Pretty cool , and easy to load with Post-it notes . Also has a whole for a pen on the side . This will be used a lot !	-1
I like the product . I like how it stores Post-It notes . I like the penholder . I like the promise of being able to mount it and remove it . Unfortunately the elastic snap-back thing did not work for me at all . I stretched out the elastic , creating an unsightly situation that I had to remove by force . In the process I ruined the straps and now I ca n't mount it again . I was going to mount it to the fridge and my wife did n't trust the adhesive . Glad she talked me out of it.Great idea , but execution of the main feature failed . I 'm pretty sure I followed the instructions , but once the thing 's mounted for a few weeks those instructions get tossed . If there is some special procedure for removal they should put them on the unit .	-1
The only reason I am giving this a low rating is that Kodak was terrible when the ink leaked . I had bought this ink for quite a while and never had any problems before . The company said that I needed a new print head which should be bought every couple of years . After this incident I switched to a Brother and have had absolutely no complaints .	-1
I replaced my empty cartridge with the Kodak 10XL Cartridge ( Black ) . After printing out 80 sheets of paper one night , I already received the `` low ink '' warning . Mind you , these were 80 sheets of double space writing , no pictures- just papers for my college students . I was so disappointed ! I had another one from the order , so I thought maybe that was just a bad cartridge . I gave the next cartridge a shot , and the same thing happened . HOW ? ? In the past 2.5 weeks , I am now on my 3rd cartridge ... and on average , I print 100 ( usually less ) pages a week . I 'm in the process of finding a much more efficient and cost-worthy ink cartridge . If anyone has suggestions , thank you ! UPDATE : There 's definitely something wrong with this product . As soon as I replaced the previous cartridge , the next one showed at half percentage . I thought it was an error in the monitor of the printer , so I went ahead and used it . It printed 21 pages . Literally . For kicks , I replaced it again with the last one I had . I just put it in tonight and tried to print . It printed as if the ink had run out a long time ago . It showed 0 % black ink for a brand new , freshly installed ink cartridge . Returning as many as I still can ( 2 ) and steering away from this brand . It seems that others are having similar issues with this product .	-1
These are listed as Kodak ink , but the ones I received are after market , and are marked Kodak compatible . I have not tried them yet , but due to the price I do intend to keep them , . The 1 star is due to false advertising .	-1

This ink cartrige leaked all over my printer . I really disliked my Kodak printer and ended up switching to a Brother . The ink lasts much longer and therefor is cheaper .	-1
I enjoy my Kodak Hero Printer , and I enjoy the prices of the ink . However , after having ordered this backup ink cartridge several months back , I noticed upon installing it today that the sensors on the cartridge , which are connected to the cartridge via some pieces a plastic , were hanging around in the cartridge bag , and not attached to the cartridge . After removing the cartridge from the bag , the plastic pieces that were supposed to be holding the sensors also fell out . The cartridge came broken- it was never used , never taken out of the box . But because the order was placed a while back ( I like to have backups ahead of time ) , I can not return or exchange it . I hope that Kodak decides to ship with more proper packaging so as to avoid product damage , if the damage was caused during shipping .	-1
( I went thru 2 of these scanners before i gave up & returned them ... ) Like many people who purchased this scanner , I have several boxes of old family photos I want to scan - but I do n't want to spend weeks doing so on a flat bed scanner , one at a time . The scanner seemed ideal and the reviews were good . You do n't have to connect the scanner to a computer ( unless you want to ) . You can put an SD card into the scanner and just plug it in & start feeding photos into the scanner . Awesome ! It scans pretty fast - about 20 seconds to scan & save the photo . You can scan at 600dpi and it just auto saves to the sd card . Once you have a lot of photos scanned , you load the sd card onto your computer and do what you will with the scans . The perfect scanner for my needs.Except for the large white lines , through all the photos.Nearly every single photo I scanned had one or more ( usually more ) long white vertical lines running thru the resulting scans . I tried cleaning the scanner with the little brush , I ran the calibration strip thru the scanner , I dusted off each photo before scanning , I tried using the little plastic insert to hold my photos . I called pandigitial support - they said it was dust being trapped on the scan head . I told them I was dusting my photos off and most of them were very clean & had no visible dust . They offered no solution.No dice , still half or more photos had white lines , basically ruining the scans . I researched and found this is a very very common problem with this scanner . I am surprised more people have n't run into this problem - or maybe they are more forgiving ? I was tempted to just `` let it slide '' I mean after all , this scanner is a HUGE time saver . But if the resulting scans are marred with long lines that show up when printing or viewing - what 's the point ? If you are going to spend $ $ on this scanner , which is n't cheap , and take the time to organize and scan your family photos - why not do it right ? After the first scanner had the white lines , I returned it to Amazon and bought a second , same make & model . Same white lines . Either I got 2 bad scanners in a row or this is just a problem with this scanner . I have since ordered a Canon flatbed scanner from Amazon that is supposed to have some fairly automatic scanning software . I know it wo n't be anywhere as fast as the pandigital , but I am hoping I wo n't be sacrificing quality for speed .	-1
Failed a few months after purchase . Mailed it in for repair under warranty as instructed over a month ago , no indication of when I can expect it back or if it will be repaired and returned . I had to pay for shipping .	-1
I bought this set two months ago specifically because it had a headset jack on the handset.Until yesterday I would have given it 5 stars.Yesterday , the phone rang and rang and rang . I have the phone set to 2 rings so my announce plays quickly and then I listen to see who 's calling me.Yesterday , the phone kept ringing without playing the announcement or connecting with the caller . It rang about 10 times I suppose and then shut off.This morning I checked my settings and it was still set at 2 rings . I called from my cell phone , same thing , kept ringing till it shut off . I disconnected the power per the manual , reconnected , same thing.I called Panasonic tech support and , after being on hold listening to music for 15 minutes , gave up and took the phone back to Sam 's Club where I got a full refund.That 's it for Panasonic as far as I 'm concerned .	-1
Absolutely terrible sound quality . People say that I sound OK , but every call that I have made over the course of two days has been very unsatisfactory . Took me three calls to Panasonic and lengthy waits before I was able to get to a technician . I will not be buying another Panasonic phone .	-1
I bought this phone to be compatible with my other panasonic phone , itt registered numbers but it would not hold a charge so it is of no use to me	-1
Pros : longer range than my last 5.8 ghz panasonic phone . physical headset jack . Non-proprietary batteries . Ability to transfer cellphone 's phonebook to itself . Ability to assign names to handsets.Cons : There is no setting in the menu to be able to turn off the light that is lit up while it is charging , which is annoying if you have one in your bedroom . It is not possible to set the privacy mode for just a single handset , it is either all on or all off . Since the phonebook is now stored on the main base unit , accessing it through the handset is slower than in previous models ; it takes a second or two to access the missed calls list as well . It should just store it on each handset and then sync it when it needs to . The time on it can not be set to 24hr , only am/pm format . A lot more expensive than competing phones that have a similar feature-set.All in all , it works and is a somewhat decent phone , but it could be better considering its price .	-1
This update on Tuesday , 6/24/2014 . About 1 year and 3 months , the phone i liked so much stopped working , all it shows now is `` base no power '' , no dial tone too . Now it really bothered me , got ta buy a new one , but seems all cordless phones are made by Panasonic nowadays , and I want to try some other brand that would last longer.This is exactly what I wanted , a simple good cordless telephone set , without the answering machine . I only have one phone line and it connected to my wireless all in one laser printer and my phone , I do n't want the stupid answering system mess up my fax accidentally . They can call back or call my cell if it is important . The sound is a major leapfrog from my old 5 ghz phone systems .	-1
When I bought this phone I needed it for work and home use , I did n't have it 3 months and the recorder quit working , leaving me without a message phone	-1
This is not the sturdiest of ID/Badge holders . The & # 34 ; strong nylon cord & # 34 ; frays quite easily and breaks fairly quickly . Tried two of them attached to a simple plastic ID card and within about 8-9 days , they both broke . The cord is very thin , much more so than ones I 've used previously . The metal clip seems okay , but I would not feel comfortable leaving my ID or something on this thing .	-1
Bought this as a gift for the holidays and while it worked great for a while , the person I gave the gift too indicated that a year later , the printer jams all the time and has been a big problem and was replaced .	-1
I 'll get to the pros and cons below but want to start of with my first impressions.Size ... Its a lower profile and more compact than I expected , one of the few good things this printer has going for itself . The ink cartridges and the boring tri color and single black . HP inks are super expensive , replacement color is $ 30 and depending if you get the XL or standard black refill its another $ 40 so that 's already $ 70 bucks for another 25 you can buy a new printer . HP inks in my opinion run out way too fast and when its one of those tri color singles one color always runs out before the others which is such a waste . I much prefer the separate ink tank colors like the Canon or the Epson has ( listed below ) .There 's not much going on in the option and button department in this printer . Some may like that because its super easy to figure out with the number pad , power button , stop and print , ok buttons . The lcd which is a terrible 2 line mono uses small triangles to indicate what mode your in ex . copy , scan , fax . The overall style of the printer looks dated to me . I 'm not a big fan of the paper tray sticking out of the front . The sheet feeder on the top feels junky and have a feeling it will break easy . Its got a glossy black finish and is already full of finger prints , I recommend leaving the plastic film they ship it in on in certain spots to avoid prints and scratches.Pros : -Size , its a nice smaller printer that is easy to fit on a desk or shelf.-Fast printing-Quick scanningCons : -No wifi-No ethernet cable included being its a wired network printer-Terrible LCD ( 2 line mono ) -Bare minimum options-No card slots-Expensive replacement inksConclusion : For the same price you can get the Epson 610Epson Workforce 610 Wireless Color Inkjet All-in-One Printer ( C11CA50201 ) which has wifi connection , separate ink tanks , media card slots , 2.5 in color lcd screen , and much more ! ! So my final thoughts on this is pass on this series of all-in-ones , it just does n't have the goods for the same price that others do with all the bells and whistles .	-1
I have been a customer of HP for many years . Purchased several models of HP printers for my businesses and home . Always been very satisfied with the quality and value of their products until this purchase of HP Officejet 4500 All-in-One . Problems with printing , scanning and copying . Very erratic response to `` Print '' command , stops after one or two pages and often in mid-page . Scanning is even worse , scans halfway and often simply goes blank . Copying is very haphazard , sometimes it responds to `` Copy '' command but often simply whirrs and rumbles then nothing ! ! ! Technical support is a joke ! It is indubitably and undoubtedly the very worst printer that I have ever purchased . This is not the expected HP quality , it is junk and that is exactly what I did with it ... dumped it in the junk !	-1
My late husband ordered this and could not get it to work after set up -- even after calling the HP tech line . He returned it and ordered the Cannon , which I did not like , so I gave it away after he died .	-1
I bought this all in one HP Officejet for my son and his wife for Christmas and from day one it had issues . The printer finally bit the dust yesterday and I have to return it to Amazon . Very unfortunate as now I have to order another three in one but it wo n't be an HP printer.I have two printers of my own and I have not had issues with them but I wo n't chance another HP printer if there are going to be issues like this with a brand new printer . Numerous phone calls to HP help desk did not help as they finally said they did n't know what was wrong with the printer . Loss of connectivity , drives being uninstalled , paper jams , etc . is just a few of the problems with this printer .	-1
In fairness , I never did try call HP support to resolve these issues -- but in the meantime , I was given another printer as a gift , and it worked immediately , so ... .Anyway , despite being pretty good with computers , I had a horrible time trying to get this working , and never could . Every stage of setup was a nightmare , and when I finally did make progress , the printer just would n't feed paper . At all.I love HP laser printers , but I think Canons are the way to go for ink jet .	-1
I have owned several printers . This is the worst technology experience that I have ever had with a printer . There are so many problems that I encounter EVERY TIME I attempt to use this printer that I would n't know where to begin . I have spent ( wasted ) so much of my time trying to resolve the issues on the company website that I do n't think I will ever purchase a HP printer again ... EVER.So here are the highlight : 1 ) The printer does n't know when it has paper ( to print on ) in the tray . 2 ) The wireless printing is unreliable . 3 ) the cheap plastic try broke within the first three days .	-1
I like the idea of the S-biners and had hoped this clip would be helpful in keeping keys in one place but still be able to pull only the set of keys I needed.1 . the main clip is not as big as I thought it would be ( my fault for not reading the product details closer ) 2. due to the size of the main clip and the S-biners the s-biners are hard to get on and off the main clip.3 . Up until recently I kept the clip with some of the s-biners clipped to my purse . Then one of the s-biners caught and snagged some clothing.I like the s-biners and went and bought some larger ones to keep my keys on.Nice idea however this product for me did not fit my purpose .	-1
I bought these to hang certain items from my camera bag or photog vest such as a white balance card and focal length viewer . They ended up being way to small for any practical use other than use as a key holder . They are also poorly built in mu opinion . They are made of plastic and the clips I received did not seem to fit securely where the metal piece meets plastic.In short , I found no practical use for this item . Perhaps to store a bunch of keys .	-1
DOES N'T FIT THE MP-830 : Well , I do n't like to give negative reviews , but I would actually give this 0 stars if I could because the ink cartridges do not fit the MP-830 as advertised in the product title and listing ( at the time of this review ) . For the most part , I have ordered compatible inks through Amazon that fit properly , but this one just does n't fit.RESTOCKING FEES : Also , I was charged restocking fees . Since the product information is incorrect , it seems unreasonable to charge the customer restocking fees for the seller 's error.WILL THIS WORK WITH YOUR PRINTER : From my experience , I found that using the Amazon test `` Will this work with you printer '' is a better indication of compatibility instead of the listing details . I trusted the listing details , but in fact , this ink cartridge does not pass the test.Here is the link for one set of compatible inks that work perfectly with the Canon Pixma MP-830 : Canon PGI-5BK CLI-8 15-Pack 3/3/3/3/3 Compatible Ink Cartridges w/ Chip for Pixma MP500 MP530 MP600 MP800 iP4200 iP4300 iP4500 iP5200 iP5200PROS : - NoneCONS : - Does n't fit the MP-830 / MP830 as advertised- Paid restocking fees even if the product does n't fitTIP : - Take the test `` Will this work with you printer '' located in the top portion of the Amazon product page	-1
I am all for recycling so when this became available through Vine I wanted to check it out . I had read a review on Amazon about it that was n't very positive . I have to say I pretty much agree with what the other reviewer said . The binder is made out of what feels and looks like cardboard , about 1/8 in . thick . The rings inside are bound by screws . If you are going to use this just to store things you do n't have to access often then it would serve it 's purpose . If it is to be used often then I do n't think it would last very long . I 've had binders that have lasted for years . The ones used regularly tend to tear at the creases near the rings . I would expect this one to tear much sooner . It wo n't resist spills . The other reviewer had problems with their binder closeing , I did n't experience that problem as much , it does stay slightly open about 1/2 inch . Overall I would recommend buying a more conventional binder as it would be more durable .	-1
I like the idea of a recycled binder , but could n't they have done SOMETHING with it to make it look less like a piece of cardboard that someone folded up and sold as a binder ? ? ? I would be embarrassed to use this in any sort of formal setting as it really does look like something that your 10-year-old nephew made in school and gave to you as a gift.Recycling is good , but there 's something to be said for design and color , too .	-1
Imagine a binder - with a cheap cardboard outer cover and that is all . I get the idea behind it being environmentally friendly , and I 'm a big proponent of environmentalism - but I ca n't stand people creating useless crap to save the environment . Certainly the metal rings work - they contain hole punched paper rather well . But if you should intend to take said papers or binder with you then you will have a few issues . One wrong move and you have bent the cardboard , no liquids near your binder , they will melt it the same as any cardboard box . Do n't stick it into a book bag or the corners and sides become mauled . You do n't want to use it in the office without a little deco or you will simply look cheap , and you ca n't even set your coffee cup on it.Final review : Idea - 4 starssturdy - 1 starattractiveness - 2 starsValue - 2 starsSorry , as much as I love the idea - it seems to be a waste of resources .	-1
Too lightweight . Not useful in an office.If you get one , you need to get a second , so you have a pair.As soon as my four-year-old saw the shoe , she said it was a ruby slipper .	-1
This dispenser holds the tape well and cuts fine but it needs some serious bedazzling and weights on the bottom . It 's design is really cute but it really comes across as something you 'd pick up at the Dollar STore - certainly not worth almost $ 16 , I plan on making mine look like Dorothy 's ruby slipper and I 'll weight the bottom and then it will be perfect.I added a photo to show how it looks just like the product photo and it well-sized .	-1
BUMMER ! I was so excited ... Let 's face it , the only thing this tape dispenser should have going for it is its good looks . However , in person it does n't look nearly as cute as the picture . It looks cheap ... and honestly ( I know this sounds odd ) -- it does n't even look all that obviously like a shoe at first glance ! It looks like some weird red sculpture that has a roll of tape in it for some reason.One big mistake the manufacturers made was making the base red too . The base should obviously be black , so that you can really see the outline of the shoe all around -- the red base looks odd , like it 's part of the shoe or something . It 's like ... hmm , modern art ? The red base is just such a bad choice . And so is that black heel ... I mean , if you 're going to use two colors of plastic , why not make the shoe red and the base black ? Then it might actually look like a shoe in person ! They also should have made it shiny , so it looked like a cute patent leather shoe . But the plastic is dull and cheap looking.Also , the cutter sucks . You have to cut the tape at kind of a weird angle , too.But the biggest mistake ? It 's too light ! ! Good grief , come on , the reason we have a tape dispenser is so that we can use it WITH ONE HAND ! Duh.If you want a cute desk accessory , I 'd suggest the black purse-shaped pop-up Post-It Note dispenser . Now THAT is adorable . ( And heavy ! And useful ! ) : - )	-1
Ok so this is more of a novelty thing then a good tape dispenser . Its not very sturdy , when you pull a piece of tape and try to cut it on the blade the thing tilts forward because on the bottom there is a rubber strip so it does n't slide but duh , they did n't put it far enough in the front to keep it from tilting . There 's no weight to this either , its hallow plastic . My real tape dispenser has sand or some kind of weight inside of it to keep it more sturdy.Again its more a kiddie novelty thing so do n't expect much from it .	-1
I SO wanted to like this . I actually did a happy dance when I saw it . It looked whimsical , charming , and exactly what this Femme De La Femme wanted as a statement on her desk . When it arrived , it is cheaply made thin plastic that I would be embarrassed to admit owning . How can they take a concept so chic and fun and turn it into such a dud ? The seams are so evident that it looks like the plastic was just snapped together . The only reason it did n't get one star is that it can be a gag gift ... .however in this day and age even a gag gift should n't be a a bit of junk plastic bound to spend eternity in a landfill .	-1
I have this super cute red shoe tape dispenser on my desk at work , everyone who comes into my office LOVES it ! They know I am a huge Wizard of Oz fan and they think it is perfect for my decor . However as a tape dispenser well it is kind of lame . The dispenser is really lightweight . you can not use it with one hand or else it will slide all over the place . It should have been weighted down . I have more boring beige office supplied tape dispenser that is so heavy it could be a weapon and when I need tape from it I can just reach over and take a piece , that is how this should have been made . Hopefully scotch will improve it .	-1
first , I got a grey/silver tone one - the picture promised a purple one.second , the footprint is way huge - why could n't they make a tiny one ? is n't portability the goal ?	-1
I liked the idea that you can have this on your desk taking up very little space . However , the cost would be high since it holds so few tapes . If they could only redesign it so that it held a month or two of tape then I believe this would take the place of the old bulky tape dispenser .	-1
I am not a high energy person -- why walk when you can ride , why stand when you can sit , etc. -- but I have never found that it takes a lot of energy or talent to use a tape dispenser . This little invention leaves me asking , Why ? What is so difficult about tearing off a piece of tape . The grip feature does n't work and you get 75 little pieces of tape ? If you are trying to survive in this economony like the rest of us , leave this little invention on the shelf , save your money , burn a calorie and simply use a standard tape dispenser . 3M is truly reaching to invent something that does not need inventing . The quality is poor , the amount of cut tapes is poor . i would n't bother with this one .	-1
This Scotch brand tape dispenser delivers 2 '' precut strips of Scotch tape from a dispenser that is supposed to be easily mounted and removed from a table top . If this product worked perfectly , I might have given it one more star , but it did n't . The dispenser will adhere vertically through suction on a table top , but it easily slides across the table if horizontal force is inadvertently delivered to the dispenser . This is somewhat like a tape dispenser being mounted on a hockey puck that glides on ice . While this statement is an exageration , it is one that I felt would get the image across . I doubt that I will find a need for this product , and accordingly , I doubt that you will find a need either . Save your money , the refilable weighted dispensers work better and allow variation in the length of tape to be dispensed . Scotch has fixed a problem in this case that did not exist.I have seen a number of new products introduced by 3-M in recent years , many of them are good ideas and reflect a company that is trying to satisfy the needs of its markets . Somehow they missed the boat on this one .	-1
The only pro to this little device is the `` desk grip . '' Once placed on the table or a desk , it 's not moving . Otherwise , the refills are a pain to put in the dispenser . The size of the pieces of tape are a little small . Pulling the tape out of the dispenser is a little awkward , as it catches at times . You ca n't just pull lightly and it comes out . This product is more expensive than traditional dispensers , as the refills are much smaller than a tape roll . It 's not as portable as traditional dispensers . It looks high-tech , but it 's just a fancy design with no real advantage over tried and true original .	-1
The tape dispenser does kind of suction to your table , but it slides around a lot . Which annoys me . I want it to stay still.The packaging is crazy hard to open , which teed me off . I thought we all agreed to make packaging that did n't take a chain saw to open ? And then the actual tape - I do n't know if I got a bum batch - took 20 pieces for it to finally start working correctly . Argghhhh ! It only comes with one packet of tape , too . The unit I got was gray - not purple like in the picture . But that was n't the problem , the functionality of the tape pieces was the problem.From SCOTCH brand I expect SO MUCH MORE.I really hope I got a bum batch of tape , because it kills me to get a lame product from a brand I adore.I would n't buy this again . I wo n't even recommend it to friends.It does get two stars because when the tape actually DOES start to work - it is the same great scotch tape that we all know and love .	-1
I was so excited to try this product , it seems like such an excellent idea and I would not longer have to cut tape myself . The main concept of this product for you to be able to grab a piece without having to cut it yourself or use two hands.However in order for this product to be hands free the suction feature has to work and it does n't , it has to be made stronger . RIght now when you go to get a piece of tape the entire unit comes off , thus defeating the purpose of this product.I would rather have a weighted bottom/magnet bottom on the unit instead of a suction cup/tape adhesive type thing.The strips of tape were a convenient size but the lack of working bottom totally defeats the purpose of using the product.Would buy again if the dispenser bottom is fixed .	-1
I love a product designed to offer a clear advantage over the market leader , but unfortunately this tape dispenser does not fit the description . It is a small and well-made dispenser designed to dispense little strips of tape . Note that this dispenser does not come with tape - which was a big hassle as the tape is not readily available . While I can see how this would be convenient if I was only wrapping presents or performing one duty where uniform little strips of tape were needed , it is not versatile for someone that might need different lengths of tape . I will stick with my old fashioned roll tape dispenser .	-1
Pros:1 . Sticks to the desk ( sort of ) . Maybe family members and colleagues would be less likely to walk off with it.2 . Only a small piece comes out at a time . Maybe this would stop kids from using up half a roll.Cons:1 . It slides around the desk . People could still take it if they want.2 . The package actually says the rubber grip might `` leave a temporary mark on some high gloss wood finishes . '' Who needs that ? ? 3 . It 's flat . The chance of me covering this with paper on my cluttered , thus `` losing '' it , is about 100 percent.4 . It 's about the size of an english muffin . I do n't have tons of clear desk space ( see above ! ) , so it 's just not helpful to me.5 . I had a hard time refilling it . Someone with arthritis or other dexterity issues will struggle . Depending on how much you use , 75 pieces probably wo n't last very long.Bottom line : I am going to stick with the `` old fashioned '' tape dispensers . The standard black office dispenser is easier to find on my desk , and the smaller ones are easier to stick in a drawer ( and hide from family members and coworkers ) . What can it do for me ? Nothing : There 's really no gap that this product can fill .	-1
I did n't care for this product right from the time I started to try and figure out how to load it , the cover was quite difficult to slide open and the unit slides around on smooth surfaces like formica . It is not a normal suction that stays put this one is more a friction type and while it does stay on the table when you pull straight up on the tape , it still slides around freely , weird . You have to really snatch the tape strip with some force otherwise you get two stuck together . I also hated that each tape strip came out with the end bent making it difficult to place the strip . I see no good reason to purchase this product and would not recommend it , I 'll stick to a normal dispenser with scotch brand tape of course .	-1
Summary : This is one of those items that works well , costs too much for what it does , and leaves me a bit mystified.Details : I ended up choosing this item from the Vine selection and have to say that it works , but I do n't understand it 's place in the desktop ecosystem . it uses the seemingly convenient , but expensive , pre-cut tape strips from Scotch . The best way to buy these is in the 12 pack ( 75 strips for each pack ) at $ 7.73 from Amazon . This pulls the price down under a penny a piece.This particular dispenser is supposed to have just enough suction from the rubber pad on the bottom to stay stuck to a smooth surface when you pull one of the strips out of the top . If you have a VERY smooth surface with no grit , it works . I found that if fails if you have even a few grains of salt or sugar on the table ( courtesy of my kids ) , or if you attempt to use it on a wood table top that is n't finished totally glass flat . It does seem to be fine on our granite kitchen counter , but I think that the need to have no dirt or dust around it is optimistic for many of us.I would guess that the best use for this is during Christmas or some other time of many gift packages . Perhaps the potential for one handed tape dispensing is enough to overcome the expense and the need to baby the surface to which this is supposed to adhere . Otherwise , I am going to stay with the large rolls of tape from Costco and the weighted dispensers we have at the office and at home .	-1
I suppose the idea is that you have this gizmo stuck down on your desk , and when you want a short strip of sticky tape you just pull one out . I loaded the smallish stack of tapes into the device with the fist one sticking up . I pulled it off -- fine . But the next tape did not appear in the slot , and I found it very difficult to dismantle the device to correct the problem . So difficult in fact that I gave up.I have no problem getting strips of Scotch tape from the old , standard dispenser and will happily go back to the good old way .	-1
Ca n't say that I 'm a big fan of this little thing . Sure it seems like it would be convienient for tapping stuff ... but I 'm not so sure myself . The problem is that the pieces of tape are a little long for my taste . It 's a waste . Also while a regular roll of scotch tape lasts and lasts , this runs out very fast . Pretty disappointing product ...	-1
Maybe it 's just me , but I have never found dispensing Scotch tape to be difficult . This product does n't make it any easier to do so.I also have no problem cutting off the length I want , so having uniform lengths in a dispenser is just not a big deal . Moreover , depending on what I am doing , I often need different size lengths.While this product does stick to my wooden desk at work , I do not keep my tape dispenser on my desk , which is filled with lots of other things . Also , since this dispenser has a suction pad that sticks to the desk , to remove it you either have to slide if off the edge of the desk or else give a tug to lift it straight up , neither of which is convenient.Finally , this product is way too expensive for the amount of tape that you get.Bottom line : I can understand why young children would like this , as another reviewer has noted . But for office or home use I think it is both uneconomical and not that useful .	-1
Pop-up tape by Scotch , is a desk grip dispenser with two inches of pre-cut tape ready for use . It is handy for gift wrapping and school projects . I would use this again and again . Try one today too , you might like it .	-1
While I heartily appreciate the concept behind this product , the execution is lousy . The suction cup does n't actually stick to surfaces , the amount of tape included is miniscule , and it more often than not takes both hands to even dispense a single piece of tape without wasting several more pieces . As a result of the latter , fingerprints get all over the next piece of tape when using both hands , else the tape does n't separate at all.I would definitely NOT buy this .	-1
I 've followed all the directions and you 've got a 50-50 chance your stuff will stay put . And I 'm not talking about heavy things either . I 'm talking about light-weight paper and even using up to 4 stickers per 6x6 inch piece . Ridiculous waste of a product . And it says you can use them over and over - welllllllllll , I guess so but where are you going to store them after you take them off if you do n't use them again immediately , assuming they are even worth saving because they actually kept an item stuck in place more than 5 minutes ? All you 're given is one plastic sheet that will of course allow you to stick the one side for storage , but how are you going to cover the other sticky side - unless you save every single itsy bitsy tiny flimsy cover square you peel off when you first use it.Poooooooor design .	-1
I was excited to try these as an alternative to that gummy double sided thick poster mount or worse , rolled up masking tape . In the end , these turned out to be just okay . Scotch has a good idea with their removable tab line , I just wish the tabs really were totally safe for the item and totally removable from the surface.For light things on hard nonporous surfaces , the tabs seem to work best . I got the best results with things like papers on my refrigerator ; photographs were difficult to remove , although they did stay up . Posters and similar weight items on walls also stayed up , but they did n't remove cleanly , either from the wall or from the item - you either sacrificed a layer of paper or paint to the sticky tab.Nothing of any weight held up anywhere and I do n't think I 'd say anything really was removed as cleanly as Scotch said it would . I 've used similar products from Scotch , and while this particular tab series came off much , much easier from surfaces than prior attempts , I 'd be wary of using any kind of product like this on anything valuable on any surface you ca n't repair.In the end , with what I 've got left , I 'll be using them for attaching inexpensive pictures and posters to paint block cement dorm room walls this fall .	-1
The most important feature that this product needs to have is _predictability_ : ( 1 ) that it will not damage either the item or the mounting surface , and ( 2 ) not release the item over time . I had no problem with the latter , but I never came close to the advertised loading . My primary interest was posting paper ranging from 20 lb ( typical laser printer ) to 80 lb of various dimensions , and here there were significant problems.Although this product does have its uses ( below ) , I am giving it a low rating because the customer should be able to use it with confidence rather than having to waste time and effort on experiments with both materials and duration ( and ... ? ) to determine if the product will cause damage . It is inconceivable that the manufacturer 's product testing did not reveal what various reviewers here had to rediscover . 3M/Scotch should have made this guidance public . To make matters worse , the marketing materials contain a deceptive example : It shows the posting of a calendar sheet for July -- implying it will be up for a month -- a material and duration for which other reviewers and I have found the claim `` removes cleanly '' to be false.One of my primary interests in this product was for posting materials on doors and walls during meetings that I was conducting elsewhere . I saw this as a replacement to blue painters tape , providing a more professional appearance . However , because these rooms belong to others and tend to be large , I can not risk the damaging the paint on the walls . Consequently , I use them only on surfaces where supplanting painters tape has lesser impact . Since I take down such items within a few hours , risk of damage seems to be minimal.Another big interest was using them to position items for viewing when working in constricted spaces , for example attaching a `` cheat sheet '' onto the side of my computer display . I also used them to stick recipe cards onto kitchen cabinets during preparation , making them highly visible , but out-of-the-way . And because they were there for only a few hours at most , I did n't see any of the damage that I found when similar paper was left up for multiple days. -- - Details -- -As other reviews here have noted , it does n't release cleanly from normal paper after a period . My initial set of tests was that 1-3 days was OK , but by 7 days , significant amount of fiber was pulled from the paper . However , in a later test , fiber was pulled from the back of the paper after only 3 days . The only difference I was aware of : It was more than 20 degrees warmer ( from 68 to low 90s ) .I experimented with posting materials on wood cabinets , on glass , on steel with baked-on paint ( office furniture , doors ) , and on _enamel_ paint on wood . No problems at 3 weeks at 68 degrees . However , because of reports in other reviews here of it pulling off paint from walls , I decided I did n't have the time to check . Note : there are multiple basic types of paint used on walls and one may find different types used in different rooms of a house with different underlying surfaces ( wood , drywall , ... ) . I was n't willing to expend the time experimenting.On these experiments : I was testing a single instance of a surface and thus I could n't tell if my success was predictive for the whole class of such materials versus simply being chance . Very discouraging.Cleaning with soapy water worked as advertised -- I could see the paper fibers it had grabbed being released.The pads are about 1mm thick , which leaves a gap between the mounting surface and item . This gap limits the area you can write on . For items posted on or near a door , this gap allowed the breeze to get behind which might be a problem for items mounted on or near a door , such as outside a meeting. -- - Aside -- -Withholding basic/critical product information from customers is unfortunately widespread . In doing a review of a competitor 's product ( Avery NoteTabs ( 16300 ) ) , I discovered that those `` removable '' tabs would become permanently attached if left on too long and that for certain materials `` too long '' was not very long . In a recent review of a software package , I discovered that the vendor explicitly decided not to publicize hardware requirements because their focus groups reportedly found that information `` off-putting '' . When I worked with Marketing people ( software industry ) , I learned that many of them were trained to interpret `` persuasion '' as manipulating -- rather than informing and motivating -- customers , and that they had condescending or contemptuous views of the typical customer ( We know best + `` You ca n't handle the truth '' ) .	-1
The Scotch Reusable Tabs sounded great so I put one on my wall to see if it would stay . It did for a couple of weeks , but then it had no weight but itself to hold . Then I uncovered the outer facing part & placed a small pack of 20 2 '' X 2 '' post it note stack to the tab . It did n't last but just a few days & it dropped off the wall . Glad I did n't test it with a breakable . Still may be usable for posters or kids pictures on the fridge but I would't trust it with any thing breakable . I did n't test if it is reusable since it failed my first test.In Him , Dr. Carl	-1
Scotch Tabs are reuseable , and they do work well on metal or enameled paint surfaces , but they are n't for heavier papers , kids craft projects , or eggshell finish latex walls . I would definitely use them again in the playroom or garage , but on a surface I want to protect I 'd think twice .	-1
As an Amazon Vine reviewer , I received a sample package of these reusable mounting tabs . I 'm not sure that all of the other Vine reviewers actually tested these tabs on multiple surfaces from reading the glowing reviews.The concept behind these tabs is great - a non-residue , reusable replacement for taping things to walls and other surfaces . Being completely transparent , usage on glass works well . Removal from any other very stable surfaces is fine.Removal from painted drywall is a disaster . One tab came clean . Another peeled a perfect square of paint from the drywall , right down to the original drywall paper backing . I 'd rather use citrasolve to remove tape residue than to have to repaint a wall that I have no matching touchup paint for . Not happy.The material I had put on the wall was a heavily coated paper and the tab peeled off of that fine . Any less stable paper surface will leave residue as well.These will find a lot of uses - but use with painted walls and wood , two of the advertised surfaces on the package , are not advised : success there will depend on the paint and substrate to avoid removing paint and the type of wood to avoid removing wood fibers .	-1
I needed to hang a poster on an existing framed picture . I thought this would be the perfect solution , I could hang the new poster on the existing glass and then in a few days when the event was over , I 'd be able to remove it no problem . Well , there was a big problem . It ripped the poster and left goop on the glass . oh well , did n't work as advertised .	-1
***** I originally really liked these tabs as the original review text below states . I have since learned that they are not as good as I had hoped . Specifically , they appear to hold on well as I had stated in my original review . Then , a few hours , or sometimes a few days later , they let go of what they were holding up . I found that in order to make my pictures stay on the wall , I had to double the recommended number of squares . What I think might help , and this is NOT in the instructions , is to limit the use of these to smooth surfaces and to actually clean all surfaces before mounting . In any case , I now judge these barely acceptable . *****These adhesive tabs are just right for hanging photos and other decorations on photo mount board , or other light cardstock . The adhesion is enough to keep photos attached to my walls , which are lightly textured wallboard with flat latex paint . The key is that you must use enough of the squares to keep within the load ratio in the instructions . The instructions say to use one square or more per 4 ounces of weight . I tested this out and found that if you go much above this limit , the objects will stick for a while , but fall off after an hour or so . This is bad because you might think you 've stuck something on for good , but it will fall off later . The fact is , that when i followed the recommendations on the container , everything was fine.So far , I have been able to stick objects on the wall and remove them without damage to the wall or the adhesive square . Once again , follow the instructions . You can not just carelessly pull the squares off , you must use care and remove them with the motion shown on the label.The only reason I gave these less than five stars is that I was initially disappointed in the slow-fall issue before following instructions . I think if one follows the directions on the package , you wo n't be disappointed . ***** UPDATE *****I found out that I would actually add even more extra tabs to keep objects from falling . It has been a bit frustrating because I thought that following the instructions fixed my `` slow fall '' issues , but this was not the case . It just changed my `` fall time '' from an hour to several hours . I have started using 1.5x the tabs and all seems well for now .	-1
When I used it initially in my classroom wall , which is painted flat , they worked well in holding small posters ( approximately 20 inches x 15 inches ) , but when I tried hanging larger , odd sized posters , such as a full size poster , the posters themselves would fall off of the wall while the tabs are still on the wall.Worst , when I tried removing the tabs from the wall , they took the paint off of the walls , too , leaving an ugly white patch.Unless you 're hanging very small things that may not require moving to another location , I would not recommend these tabs .	-1
if there 's any sort of texture on your wall , this thing is NOT going to work . sad . i was trying to mount a calendar to the wall in my kitchen , and figured this would be the PERFECT thing for the job . Nope ! Within 5 minutes the calendar flopped onto the floor . The scotch tab was perfectly adhered to the smooth backing of the calendar , but I could n't get it to stick to the wall at all . It 's now stuck to the fridge instead ( lame ) - we 'll see how long that lasts.This would probably be good for VERY smooth walls , but better for something like glass or a school locker or something .	-1
Scotch came up with a great idea when they invented these Reuseable tabs , but the idea that looked great on the drawing board has failed in it 's actual application and use by the customer . I used these clear square sticky tabs that look like a square of very thick scotch tape on a variety of wall surfaces with a variety of paper types from heavy cardboard to thin drawing paper . I left each paper stick to many different surfaces for a full week and the results were all the same in the end-they simply do n't work.The tabs stick well to plastic and metal refrigerators- very smooth surfaces , for a couple days . For painted walls , basement cement block and wood , they do not stick at all . After a week of using different papers on a variety of very smooth surfaces , thin drawing paper could not be removed from the tabs without tearing it off . Heavy photo paper did remove , but took off the top thin paper layer on the back . The same for light to heavy weight cardboard- the top layer wo n't come off , and just stays stuck and tears ! Posters could be removed very , very carefully if they were heavy enough- thinner posters or old ones simply tore . I 'm glad I did n't test these on anything valuable ! Basically , the longer the papers had the tabs on the back , the harder it was to remove without total destruction of the paper ! I followed the directions to a tee when removing the paper from the tabs- slowly , by the tab corners , being as careful as I could . After 1 week , the few things that were still hanging , simply tore because the paper would not peel off the tab , kind of like removing scotch tape from thin paper after years ! This great idea needs to go back to the drawing board as it 's basically good for the smoothest surfaces and the thickest paper for maybe a day or two before the adhesive becomes a permanent part of the paper ! Until Scotch gets the MANY bugs out of these new tabs , I 'll stick to my magnets and keep my treasured paper items and posters free from adhesive damage !	-1
I 'm a little surprised by all of the positive reviews here to be honest.The tabs are much thicker than I anticipated . I started thinking they 'd be able to hold heavier sheets of paper ( thick construction paper , artwork with glued on things , etc . ) No such luck . My first attempted hanging resulted in the paper falling to the ground within an hour or two . Maybe it was the texture of the paper.I 've since successfully hung a few single sheets of copy paper on the back of my office door . I 've tried to reposition them but the paper starts to tear and it threatens to peel the paint off the door.I think I 'll take my chances with a piece of much less expensive tape . This seems too sticky for regular paper and not sticky enough for anything of substance .	-1
These are thin flexible but not spungy plastic squares sticky on both sides . The instructions on the back of the package state that they are intended to hold art or other lightweight items , 0.25 lb/square , total not more than 1 lb.I , being a naive and trusted user , affixed 2 squares on a high quality photo with thin foam backing . The entire item weighed about 3 ounces . When I affixed it on a wall , it looked quite pleasant . The next morning I found the picture on the floor with the corners of the foam damaged from the fall to the tile floor . Hence , I am not sure how one can entrust this method of hanging more than a small thin sheet of USELESS paper on a FLAT CLEAN TILE wall .	-1
UGHHHHH another packaging NIGHTMARE ! The Scotch Green cardboard is entirely intertwined into the dispenser so that you ca n't get it out without breaking off the teeth that cut the actual tape at the edge of the dispenser.Do these companies even TRY their products before they release them ? Really ? ? Two stars because , the tape is the fabulous scotch tape that we all know and love . `` Stick '' ( HA ! ) to the rolls and the heavy weight dispensers that you steal from your cubicle.I wo n't be buying this one again .	-1
I wanted to like this product . In fact , I wanted to love it , because it 's a well-known name and I love their other products , but this fell short ... badly ! It could have been that I had a defective product , but why take a chance in the future ? I love that the product itself is bright and colorful . It 's tactile in the way that it has finger grips , essentially telling you how to hold this and how to maneuver it . It is re-fillable , easy to open , and it looks like a product that would be great for craft projects galore ! When I went to use this , it would give about 50 % of the time . You 'd run it along the back of a photo , and it would stop 1/2 way through . I 'd have to re-trace more often than not . Projects then take twice the amount of time they should.Then I thought , I must be holding this wrong or something , so I played around with it . Then it did n't stop , but the 2 pieces of tape that separate to lay down the glue dot adhesive , 1 part would droop out of the mechanism , not spooling inward . So , I opened it up to check the spool , and it worked when you manually spun it , but would n't catch when you were running the tape over paper . UGH ! How frustrating ! So , I am going back to what I know . If you want a good tape runner , go with Kolo.Kolo Photo Album Accessories - Photo Tape Gunor if you want a back-up brand , go with Tombo Photo Tape , which allow refills .	-1
The refillable Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller promised to take the place of at least a half a dozen dried out and ineffective glue sticks I had in my drawer . I wanted to use it to put stamps on envelopes and reattach photos onto old family album pages.I have a graduate degree ( not engineering ) and still have n't figured out how to get the darn thing to work . The directions did n't help .	-1
I admit the IDEA is cool : This little gadget with an internal mechanism that allows you to `` swipe '' it on a piece of paper and leave behind these little adhesive dots . But I did n't care for it . I would pick it up and roll it the wrong way , or check to see if there are still dots to use and end up just getting some on my fingers . I did n't find the adhesive to be that strong either - for glueing a light piece of paper to another , sure it worked fine , but anything heavier than a sheet of paper did cause it to come undone . And my biggest issue - is that once you buy this , you yet again are now stuck with another device that you need to search for refills for , once you run out . I 'd rather use glue or tape . You always know where it is , you always know if you have some , you always know it will be available to buy in any store 20 years from now .	-1
I do a lot of cards , a lot , and a lot of scrap booking , and generally a glue stick works perfectly , but I figured I would try something new . : ) The nice thing about this is you do n't have to worry about it drying and warping the paper , so it is absolutely perfect for scrap booking and card making . The only thing that makes it less than ideal for that is that the adhesive comes out in dots rather than strips , but that is a pretty minor quibble . The adhesive stick very well , since you do n't want cards to fall apart or your scrapbook , you want them there forever , this works very well , time will tell how long things stick for , and I will update if things start falling off , but for now the tape works great ! So , if you are looking for a quick fix to a glue stick , then this might work for you , it really all depends on what kind of work you will be doing.UPDATE ( 12/18/10 ) : so , I tried using this the other day on some card stock and it would not work well unless I pressed hard on the paper , and then on top of that , the pressing harder caused the tape to come off the runner and it will NOT stay back on when I put it back on , and sadly , b/c I had only tested it and not used it extensively up to them , I rated it 5stars , but now I have to rate it 2stars from my own experience , it is not a very good product . If other people find it works better great , but it was absolutely non-functional after one serious use , I am not impressed . My friend has many products of this nature as she is a card maker to the max , and has never had these kinds of issues , so my advice is to pick up a different item/brand of this type.God Bless ~AmyGod Bless ~Amy	-1
I was excited about this product because I was thinking that my children would be able to use it , and it would n't be as messy as those glue sticks out there . Imagine my disappointment when my 8 year old daughter was having issues with it ... you really have to put a good amount of pressure at a particular angle to get all the glue dots on the paper . The idea is great , but the fact that you simply ca n't roll it and have it work is frustrating . I 'll still be using it for myself , but I do n't think I 'll be buying refills for it ... even when I used it I had trouble getting all the glue on the paper , which means stuff does n't stick as well as it should !	-1
product only secures 1 or 2 pieces of paper . needed all six strip to mount an 8x11 card stock sign .	-1
I decided to use this in my work office for a couple laminated graphics that I wanted to put up on the wall in my work space and when I wanted to move them last week I noticed that the this stuff really sticks ! It took off a nice chunk of paint off the first one I went to take off . The others I just took the posters off ( laminated aspect helped here ) and then slowly slowly took the adhesive off the wall . The maintenance department was not happy with me as they had to come in and touch up the wall with some new paint.I tried some adhesive remover to get them to come off but that was doing even more damage to the paint on the walls.I 've found that if you want to use this stuff you are better off putting it on a surface that you wont be worried about . like plastic panels , metal surfaces , dry erase boards or even doors ( that are n't painted ) .It really will hold whatever very well to any surface just about that you want it to but it will come at a cost of being a royal pain in the rear to get back off later on .	-1
I looked forward to using this product to help my very young daughters hang their artwork on their walls . Unfortunately , it simply does not hold up . Even a 24 '' x 18 '' piece of light paper fell down within 12 hours after placing a generous square of the reusable strips in each corner . It will stick to the wall just fine ( and does come off a painted wall without leaving a mark as advertised ) . However , if it can not hold up paper , it does not meet its purpose , so I can not give it more than one star.I would suggestDAP 01201 BLUESTIK Reusable Adhesive Puttyas being more successful at accomplishing the same goal .	-1
The idea of this product is great and very `` green '' sounding . The problem is that once you use a strip , it is difficult to save it for use at a later time . It has to stay in use or it is no good . It is just as if you are saving a used piece of tape . Even if there was a good way to store it , the strength of the tape is compromised after its first use . I love products that can be used multiple times , but tape is not one of them .	-1
Q . What is it ? A . It 's a weird tape-like substance that you can use over and over.Q . Why ? A . Not really sure , but the Scotch R & D ; guys have to keep inventing new stuff if they want to keep their jobs.Q . What do you get ? A . Six strips of 1 '' x 3 '' double-back clear tape.Q . Huh ? A . Right.So this stuff is pretty cool , but I ca n't think of that many uses for it . The one use that seems pretty practical is classrooms & conference rooms . I 'm thinking of a corporate training center where the instructors make notes on big flip charts and then taped these to the walls . This tape would be perfect for that , because they could just use these same six strips of tape day after day after day . When the tape gets grubby after repeated use , you can just wash it off and then it 's sticky again after it dries . I do n't know if that 's completely practical for classroom applications , but it works.Aside from that , it 's not really practical for wrapping a present or repairing your spectacles . It 's just a pre-cut piece of tape ( 6 of 'em ) that you can use for adhering lightweight items to smooth/clean surfaces . That 's it .	-1
I am not sure why but I have the lightweight mounting squares and they work perfect , see my other review . Something is wrong with these 1x3 strips , they just are not as sticky as the squares even though they both say lightweight mounting . They only thing I can use these for are photographs . I even went and got a package from the local store to see if it was a batch problem . I put up a poster in a kids room and it just peeled off .	-1
I had high hopes for this item . Followed directions , quite simple . Claims to be reusable . Well , only if you count how many times the item falls and has to be replaced . I used this for a movie poster , quite lightweight . It held for about a day or two , then the poster fell . I replaced it , and it fell again . Quite disappointing . I would not use these again or recommend these .	-1
I ca n't believe that a company like Scotch would sell something of this poor a quality . My trial for this item was this : I cut a piece of the scotch mounting strip and put it on the side of my printer and mounted a small post-it page keeper on top of the strip . Once during the day the post it fell off and I decided that I had n't pushed hard enough when I put it on the mounting strip . I put it back on with more force . The next morning when I got up the post it was laying on my desk again . Reading on the back of the reusable strip package I found out I could wash the strip and it would be completely renewed . Wrong . Now it 's completely useless and its just a piece of pliable plastic . I threw these things away .	-1
Items have to be very light to stay put . I tried to hang a National Geographic map on the wall with two strips and it fell within an hour . Pieces of the map also stuck to the strip when removed , rendering the strip unusable.. If this is limited to such light material , I think one may be better off buying Scotch Removable tape at a much lower cost .	-1
I was excited about the possiblity of a reusable alternative to my family 's addiction to scotch tape..however , for now it seems we 'll be sticking with the original thing.First off , this is not convenient . I chose to cut to smaller size first , which was a option I liked . But , then it left me with a ton of little pieces of film to peel off both sides . I should 've peeled the big piece and then cut . Those little pieces of backing/fronting film were a pain to clean up , all that static cling ! This whole process took much , much longer than just tearing off a piece of conventional tape.Once my daughters ' artwork was hung up , I was happy with it 's ability ... but , the kicker was the odor of this product , it stinks ! ! It has this very obnoxious off gassing smell ! ( kind of like a SUPER , SUPER , SUPER strong scotch tape smell ) I figured it 'd air out , but it did n't ! I woke up the next morning and as soon as I entered the room I could smell it . So , down it went.I also realized that although it may be reusable , it 's not super easy to store . I peeled all the little squares I had cut off and put them back into the original packaging.When I decided to give this a second shot , when I just needed one square , I found all my little pieces had stuck together in a clump . Oops , should 've been more careful placing them back.Anyway , that one little square I needed was to hang a ribbon on the window . It 's doing the job there ! It works wonderfully on the glass and just one square is n't enough to emmit an odor strong enough to notice on it 's own.Over all , as much as I hoped it would , this product just did n't fit my intended use as a reusable tape . I can see where it might be useful to others , if it 's odor does n't bother you .	-1
I have a small digital clock that weighs in at well under one pound . I used 3 strips to attach it to my wall ( when one theoretically should have been enough ) .About 10 minutes later I heard my clock falling off the wall . This stuff simply failed under a small load.It is for this reason that I do n't like it , would n't buy it again and ca n't recommend it .	-1
These are just terrible . I used them on my daughter 's not-very-textured walls ( eggshell finish paint ) and then wo n't even hold up a simple poster even when used at well more than double the recommended strip to weight ratio . I am pretty disappointed because this seemed like such an it's-about-time project . Too good to be true , I guess .	-1
We live in an area that easily reaches 125 degrees in the summer . And sometimes it 's also very humid . It seems odd for this desert area , but it 's a fact . I used these strips -- six per poster -- to hang theatrical movie art in a media room , but the posters kept falling off the wall , sometimes with the sticky strip still on the poster . Other times , it remained on the wall . Not sure if it 's the temp or just a weak product . The idea is a good one , bit they need to make a super sticky version .	-1
This stuff peels the paint right off the wall and took some drywall with it.My walls are pretty new 2004 , painted with good quality paint about 6 months ago.Stuck this on ( it 's very sticky ) and when I tested it by pulling it off , it pulled off a huge piece of paint with it ! Now I need to go get some old paint and repaint that section of wall.I 'd say this stuff is okay on metal or plastic or at work where you do n't care about the walls . But do NOT use this on painted walls at home.I 'm also uploading a picture of the damaged wall so take a look at it .	-1
I used the scotch reusable strips to hold up my children 's chore list . I change it every month , so needed something that I can reuse . These strips hold items very good , but do not release for reuse at all . I ended up ripping the paper I was trying to take off the wall , I would not recommend this item .	-1
I used these to stick up paper `` artwork '' around the house . I stuck it to surfaces with ; woodwall paper , painted cement , and painted wall board.These strips are rated to hold objects up to one pound in weight . I did n't try it with anything close to that weight , as I just tried paper.A week later when I went to change out the paper `` artwork , '' and found much of the artwork had already fallen down . I was unable to get the strips to re-stick to the surfaces.on a positive note , there was ZERO damage to any of the surfaces.I 've tried the yellow `` tacky '' gum stuff , and even though it claims not to damage surfaces , it permanently marked the back of a book case when removed later . It also did n't hold up posters or paper as well , especially after it dries out too.I have found a lot of different uses for these sticky clear tapes/strips . Framed pictures on the wall that often end up crooked , are now held straight with a strip of this stuff placed between the bottom of the frame and the wall . ( the picture is still supported mainly by the nail it 's hanging on . ) I 'm using it to put up posters , and to place notices on cabinets or the refrigerator as needed , but after a week of dry fall weather , many of these items have since fallen down.They need to find a way to keep these things from losing their stickiness !	-1
Not too happy with these strips , they are large and seem as they would hold but they continue to keep falling off the walls . I would not recommend as they need improvement .	-1
I tried to hang some student work on painted concrete , and the work did n't want to stick . You do n't get much for your money either . This is not something I would ever purchase again ! The value is just not here.I 'll stick to other methods ( no pun intended )	-1
Came very poorly packaged , falling out of boxes , incredibly dusty . Also , they are really old . You can tell that by the before mentioned reasons as well as the fact that the & # 34 ; Box Tops for Education were over 4 years out of date .	-1
Ok , there are so many Post-It notes on the market ... .colors , shapes and sizes . But this one is fantastic ! I am in college and I have to often mark text for reference . I have been using standard Post-Its , but these are thicker , lined and have tabs . I wish I would have had these before now ! I will be buying more ! UPDATE March 6th : I have discovered that these post-it notes damage book pages if left on for very long . I have ripped several pages from a textbook as I tried to gently remove the post -it tabs . Further , the ones I do get off , they leave a fine residue . After this experience , I will be going back to regular post-it notes .	-1
Compared to other typical sticky notes , this Note Tab is relatively thicker and does n't absorb ink fast . The entire surface of the Note Tab is writeable although it does n't absorb ink as fast as other regular sticky notes . If you use ink-based pen , you 'll need to leave the note tab sits for a moment before applying it to your book to prevent smudges on its opposite page . Alternatively , use quick-dry ballpoint or pencil.Each note tab will be used to mark pages within book and the tab will likely be the first to get worn pretty quickly . I feel the thickness of the note tab is just right to keep the tab lasts long enough.One thing the note tab scores low is its adhesive which does n't work well on most of my books , especially when I flip through the pages quickly .	-1
I should have paid more attention before selecting this label . While the label provides ample room to write notes , the label is so large that I end up covering part of a page that would prefer to see . It 's too hard to find a place to put this large label where it does n't cover everything . One place where I plan to use the label will be for recipes where I want to cover an existing ingredients list with a revised list based on a different number of portions . For users who want a lot of writing space , and are willing to cover existing items , this label should be fine .	-1
I bought this AT & T ; phone answerer based on a review in Consumer Reports magazine and my past experience with a similar but DIFFERENT AT & T ; phone/answerer that I purchased three years ago . WHAT A DIFFERENCE ! 1 : No HOLD Button . I keep the base phone/answerer on my bedroom table . If I want to then go to my kitchen to take the call , ( which is where I keep the addictional included wireless handset ) I have to go to the kitchen , answer it there and then either COME ALL THE WAY BACK to my bedroom to hang up the handset , OR hope that I remember to hang it up when I finish my call . My older AT & T ; unit had a HOLD button.2 : No BELT CLIP ! I live in a two story house with a basement and a garage . I always hang the cordless phone to my belt . This thing has NO CLIP ! ! ! 3 : TURNING RINGER OFF : With my older AT & T ; I just pressed a MECHANICAL button on the right side of the handset to raise , lower or TURN OFF the ringer . Not with this one . You must go through the MENU and press SEVEN selections to turn it off . ( I counted them , SEVEN ) 4 : ANSWERING MACHINE VOLUME : I ALWAYS turn my phone ringer and ANSWERING MACHINE VOLUME off before I go to bed . The old unit ? EASY ! J ONE button to lower or turn the volume OFF while still having the machine ON . Not now . You can raise or LOWER the answering machine , but you can NOT turn it OFF and still let the unit answer your calls . It wakes me up AND I do NOT want people to hear my messages coming in when I have company.5 : CORDED HANDSET on he base : They did NOT take the cord into consideration when designing this phone . When you hang up the handset , the stem of the phone cord touches the table . If you have ANYTHING around the phone that interferes with the handset , it will NOT hang up properly and your phone will be `` off the hook '' . If you are an anal retentive Felix Unger neat freak , you 're good to go , but if you have ANYTHING on your desk or night table that might get near this thing , it WILL interfere with it hanging up . It is sloped downward and the wire hits the table it is sitting on.SUMMARY : This is a CHEAPENED version of AT & Ts ; previous model and it is very noticable that what they did was to take the old one , figure out how they can make it MUCH cheaper ( in quality , not price ) and send it to market . It 's junk , and it 's going backIf none of the above LACK of features bother you , then the phone does allow you to call or answer calls . BIG DEAL !	-1
I just purchased this phone and I think I am going to return it . It is extremely difficult to operate . The product manual is over seventy four pages long.The worst part , as far as I am concerned , is that the phone does not allow for one to leave a personal outgoing message . One is either stuck with the provided digital voice or has to purchase voicemail . In my case , this would be voice mail from AT & T ; , so after spending nearly $ 100 on a phone , I have to spend more to buy a service I do n't need so people know they reached me . If I turn off the answering system , the voice mail will pick up , but the phone will not indicate if I have any messages . I get nothng from this phone that I could not get from any other two line phone without an answering system.The good qualities ( although not enough to redeem it ) . The phone will tell you who is calling on the other line if you are engaged on one and separate rings can be used for both lines . That 's about it . I am very disappointed .	-1
Maybe , in the age of iPhones and Netbooks and MP3 players , I 've gotten spoiled . But I was expecting more from this tool than I got.Yes , the product works . You type words into it , and it will correct spelling , define words , etc . It 's simple enough for a child to use , without a lot of training . In short , it will do as advertised . So in theory , having a little device my son can stash in his backpack for school would be great.However , the whole thing is just so ... cheap . The buttons have some responsiveness problems , so that they do n't always register on the first press . The display window is 1980s era LCD display , with the kind of chunky pixel font that is hard to read . The audio quality of the reading voice is comparatively old-tech , and it is not the clearest voice to understand.Here 's the kicker , though : this is a writing tool , but nowadays any kid in third grade or higher is probably going to be writing on a computer word processor , which will do all of this for them , and better . So it 's all a bit archaic.Of limited appeal , at best .	-1
This device is supposed to help kids with spelling and related tasks such as definitions , rhyming , Thesaurus , and maintaining a customized list of words . It also offers a `` Confusables '' option . I assume that is the manufacturer thinks this is easier to spell or say than homophone . I would prefer to just use the terminology that the kids learn in school than to make up a new word.Unfortunately this device is a disappointment . My 3rd grade daughter thought it was `` lame '' , and I have to say I feel the same . There is no volume control , contrary to what the button labeled `` volume down and up say . When you push that button it just says `` key has no effect '' . Perhaps they want the volume to stay loud so a kid can not use this device to cheat during a test , but the instruction sheet makes no mention of volume control whatsoever . And at that , the speaking voice is very loud , so it makes it pretty annoying to use . You ca n't take it and play with it anywhere , because it is too loud for playing with at the store , for example . So if you were thinking of getting this instead of a Nintendo DSi or something , forget that.Also this device requires 4 AAA batteries , which is secured by a battery door-cover that has to be screwed in with a microscopic Phillips head screwdriver . Of course , this , nor the 4 batteries are not included with the machine . The frustration level of this thing is through the roof ! Because this is an elementary school level dictionary , there are many words that you will type in , and it will try to match up a word with another word that is spelled similarly . So you never actually know if the word will be in this device or not.For $ 60 , I would rather invest in a regular book-form dictionary and/or spelling dictionary .	-1
There is really nothing positive that I can say about this product . The fact that it did not come with batteries was not a problem but I felt that for $ 60 , the ear phone should have been included . After loading it up , it had to be reset in order to wake up the screen which according to the directions demands the most delicate maneuvering with a paperclip so as to not permanently destroy the dictionary . As other reviewers have stated , the graphics are primitive , the robo voice grating , screen too small , choice of rhyming words inappropriate , various features confusing and of limited value etc . etc . Advertised as suitable for children in grades 1-5 , this product would have no appeal for most kids in that age range today . The reality is , technology is amazing and useful and its applications growing at warp speed . Children and adults also need to be able to learn to work interdependently , developing solid relationships with human beings . To place yet another cheap-o gizmo like this into their hands does little to cultivate imagination , creativity , genuine learning or interpersonal skills .	-1
Pros:1 . Easy to use keyboard2 . Voice speaks to you3 . Gives dictionary definitions , has some games like Tic Tac Toe , Hangman.4 . You can see each word written slowly , letter-by-letter in manuscript or cursive.Cons:1 . Mechanical speaking voice sounds cold and sinister , not friendly at all ! 2 . Voice is very hard to understand . In dictation game , I could n't understand any of the words it asked me to spell.3 . `` Hangman '' game has some very odd word choices ( like 'pis ' - plural of pi ) . ( ! ) 4 . Lid contains the instructions , but flops backward ; does not stand up to be read.5 . Battery cover requires ridiculously small Phillips screwdriver ( not included ) 6 . Games , graphics , and sounds are all pretty lame.7 . Offers rhymes for your given word , but they are often strange choices , ie : words that rhyme with `` red '' : hammerhead , outspread , and behead.8 . Definitions are not particularly easy to read.Overall , this could be useful for a motivated 7-9 year old who has no access to a computer and is easily amused , but it 's a bit primitive and does n't really seem worth the effort .	-1
I received this item for free through Amazon vine . I played with it for a while and then gave it to my 7-year daughter for her reaction . My initial reaction was that the product was fairly decent . It functions very well as a portable dictionary and spelling device . It looks like a children 's toy , and given the colors and design , was clearly intended for children . When I first opened the package , I assumed it was priced in the $ 20.00 price range , and it appears to be a good value if sold at that price . Then I went to Amazon 's web-site and found that it sells for almost $ 60.00 , and my initial reaction changed considerably.I do n't know why anyone would pay $ 60.00 for this product . The build quality is very flimsy . When removing it from the packaging , my wife actually dislodged the cover , and it was somewhat difficult to put back on.It comes with several spelling games , which would be very useful for kids learning to spell , but only if the voice quality was clear enough to understand . Unfortunately , the voice quality is very mechanical and it is often difficult to understand what it has said . That makes playing the spelling games very frustrating.In short , if you need a portable dictionary and spell corrector and do n't have access to the internet , and you can find this for about $ 20.00 , I 'd buy it . At $ 60.00 , it 's hard to imagine why anyone would . In fact , this very same manufacturer ( Franklin ) makes other similar products that are more stylish that you can buy on Amazon.com for under $ 40 ( today at least ) . I do n't see any reason why this product should command a premium over those products . If anything , this product should be cheaper .	-1
I thought my son would love this , he is 6 and reads fairly wellm and he did for the first few minutes , and then it went downhill . In theory , this is a great product . Unfortunately , theory does not always carry over into real life , as is the case here . First the good ... ..Phonetic spell correction is good and fast , definitions can be spoken , which is great , the design , while a little busy is not terrible and you get used to it . This could be a great tool ! And at this price , quite frankly , it should be ! The problems are many ... .first , it feels like the cover is flimsy and will easily break . It has an entire cheat sheet/instructions on the the inside of the cover which would be great if it stayed up and did not fold backwards . The graphics are just horrible and similar to some of the `` made in china '' trinkets you can buy from street vendors for a couple of dollars . The words are hard to read . The tone of the voice is horrible ! Cheap , cheap , cheap . It 's just too bad that the finished product did not pull it off ... ..this is probably a pass .	-1
Within about six months of buying this all-in-one and after installing the first set of genuine Lexmark color ink replacement cartridges , I began having problems printing acceptable color photos . After repeated cleanings , including deep cleaning , the printer still produced streaky test pages , especially from the cyan and yellow cartridges . In the process , I exhausted the entire ink supply . I then started buying cheaper , compatible ink . Suddenly , the problem resolved itself , only soon to reappear with the same symptoms and results . By the time I finally contacted Lexmark support last November , I had gone through several sets of color ink cartridges without being able to solve the problem once and for all . Lexmark support advised me to remove , clean and replace the print head , not exactly an easy self-help task . But , that too , failed . You may wonder why I kept this machine this long ; well , only because I could continue to print text without problems , and that generally constitutes the bulk of my printing needs . I also continued to use it as a black-and-white copier and scanner . But now I have finally given up on this machine and replaced it with a Canon PIXMA MX892 . I have contacted Lexmark and invoked my extended ( 5-year ) warranty to try to get this thing repaired at not cost to me , so I can at least keep it as a back-up printer . We 'll see what they say to that . This machine has probably cost me more in ink by now than its original purchase price , so my total current cost might be about $ 500.00 to date ! NOT RECOMMENDED !	-1
11-26-2012 Update : Lexmark Pinnacle Pro901 All-in-One Printer is NOT compatible with Windows 8 . Only some function accessible using hardwired USB connection . There are no drivers for this machine and Windows 8 insists that it is INCOMPATIBLE . This machine has NEVER been a suitable printer and I hate to trash it , but I will soon when I finish using all my ink supply . GAD ... do n't even think of not using LEXMARK ink . It hardly works with LEXMARK ink , let alone try any other brand . I would give it a MINUS 5 STARS , if there was such.Interestingly my Lexmark Optra E312L laser printer is still working like a champ ; even with Windows 8 using USB . No problems for 13 years now , but then I do n't use it heavily.6-1-2012 . I purchased the Lexmark Pro901 because I 've had good success with a prior Lexmark printer . I have a Lexmark Optra E312L laser printer that 's 12 years old and still works great with never a failure . The Pro901 , however , has been troublesome for the six months I have had it . The machine and printhead have both been replaced by Lexmark , although I believe only the printhead was failing , but they could not diagnose that . Installation of the software has been a total nuisance and I have had to do it 15 times over the six months , as some features just quit working and reinstall is the only way to get them back operational . I still ca n't get downloads from Lexmark site and multiple calls to the Technical support have not helped . I 'll keep tring to resolve the matter , as I 've got 30 years of computer experience and can usually figure it out . When the machine works right , the results are great , but the `` when '' is problematic . I 've spent many hours `` fixing '' this machine so it works . The replacement is still only partially operational . The Lexmark Tech support has been very willing to help but since they seem to be in the Phillipines , communications are very limited , even with their `` remote '' login to try and diagnose the machine . Also , the ink cartridges seem to fail frequently . I have yet to finish a set of ink cartridges without them failing . This is getting expensive . Sorry , Lexmark , but your new technology `` sucks '' . Great concept - poor performance .	-1
There were two labels attached to the rear portion of the organizer . After removing the labels there was a sticky residue left behind . I am unable to remove the stickiness and its resultant discoloration regardless of what type of Goo Gone or other removers I use . Not really a problem because it is on the back of the organizer . However , there apparently was a sticker at one time on the front as well because there is a same sized sticky square on the lower right hand corner . This is a distraction to the appearance of the organizer because of the stickiness and because the square is a different color than the rest of the front . In addition to the unsightly sticky square there are bubbles on the front of the organizer . This is the result of poor workmanship in attaching the outer layer to the frame . Without the stated flaws this would be a fairly nice organizer considering its relatively low price . I received this from the Vine program so I do n't consider it returnable . Although it is too unsightly to use on my desktop I believe I can find a use for it in my workshop .	-1
I ordered this folio file because I thought that it would fit all my files , but sadly it does not ! On top of all that , the quality is horrible ! It is so paperthin that it ripped just inserting the tabs ! What is that about ? Very unhappy . I wish I had not gotten this .	-1
The Smead stadium file is designed to sit on a corner of your desk with twelve slots of different heights to allow the user to quickly identify the folder that is needed . After using it for about a month , I question the durability , usability and stability of the product . The high cost of a paper product that is hard to use leads me to not recommend it.More details:1 ) Durability : The product is basically made out of paper . The exterior of the unit is a thicker , more industrial material . While the fixed interior folders are pretty flimsy and easily tear . ( I 've already taped one interior folder ) . If this is to be used a place to store documents you are actively using , wear and tear will be noticeable quickly . I recommend using a stand-alone folder for each of the twelve pockets so that identification of the paper can occur away from the somewhat fragile fixed interior pockets.2 ) Usability : It seems like this product should have fewer pockets that are perhaps a bit wider . This would truly permit quick filing . The twelve pockets all seem to run together , especially if a portable colored folder is not used . Wider pockets would also facilitate removal of paper , including smaller pieces of paper like receipts that fall to the bottom of the immovable folders . This product is not designed for constant use . As a place to store active project folders , I question its suitability.3 ) Stability : As a paper product , the stadium file is quite light in weight . Adding paper promotes stability . However , the more paper that one adds , the more difficult it is to find a particular item since the interior folders are so close together . The unit expands a bit but not much.Overall , I feel that this product could be designed better with the interior pockets being wider . I recommend using a portable folder to minimize manhandling of the interior , immobile folders that are somewhat delicate . If I found this in a store , at this price point ( around 19 dollars ) , I would walk right by it and go for a wire step file . This needs to be ten dollars less in price.According to product packaging , this unit is assembled in Mexico .	-1
I received this phone for free . As a free phone it is great . By that I mean it has n't been thrown out . But if I had paid for it I would have returned it . The sound quality is low and the phone does n't stretch to outside ( even just the other side of the concrete wall that it is mounted on ) . The bluetooth feature is a neat idea , but I do n't charge my cell phone in the room I wanted this mounted in so I ended up not using it after the initial testing period . And really I mostly use the phone to call out , not to receive calls , so that 's not a necessary feature for me.Battery life is good ! Otherwise I do n't recommend these phone for people who use a cordless phone a lot .	-1
Maybe I just do n't understand the product , but if the whole point of this is to connect it to your phone and use your cellular minutes , then do n't bother . Get another phone system that is cheaper without that feature.As the sticker on the box clearly says , your cell phone must be INCHES away from the phone base . I 'm sorry , but that 's far too inconvinent for me , especially since the base ( if I am to hook it up to my land line as well ) is in my kitchen where the cellular reception is quite poor.Even if you get past that , the phones would rarely re-sync to each other when I came home . I had to go through the full sync process nearly every time I came home -- as if it `` forgot '' about the other phone.When it worked , the quality was fine . It was just too much hassle to put up with .	-1
These are beautiful-looking phones that promise to connect your cell phones to handsets seamlessly with no cables , even replacing your land line if desired . Unfortunately , after trying these for a week , they only deliver on appearance and I 've switched back to the previous cordless handsets we have.Specifically , the Bluetooth connection drops constantly and there 's no phone-book synchronization . Plus , if you 're using your cell as the platform , you have all the inconvenience of a weak Verizon connection without the contacts on your cell phone . After a while , it 's just more obvious to use your cell phone and ditch these altogether.I really wanted to like these units with their sleek appearance and the obvious benefits of extending a cellular connection across a house . Maybe they 'll get it right in version 2 .	-1
I had the previous non-Bluetooth iteration of Motorola 's DECT 6.0 cordless phones , which I promptly returned because they dropped landline calls . I figured with a product that awful , any new version would have to be an improvement.Apparently , Motorola disagrees.The handsets feel cheap . And not `` uncharacteristically Motorola '' cheap , but `` were these on sale at a drugstore ? '' cheap . Motorola seems to have taken a `` MORE ICONS = BETTER THAN '' approach to their display , presumably as a throwback to their cell phone heritage . When Motorola first designed these phones , they were riding on a wave of design kudos from their RAZR series phones . Nearly eight years later , they 're still trying to ride that wave . It might not be convenient to use , but at least it looks outdated , right ? Right ? Sound quality was unimpressive , compared to lower-end DECT phones , and downright disappointing compared to a midrange Panasonic DECT phone . Handset range was about on par with midrange DECT phones , as was Bluetooth range.Speaking of Bluetooth , pairing this with my iPhone 4 was pretty straightforward after glancing at the manual , and worked as it was supposed to ( though not necessarily as advertised ) . That brings up two caveats:1 ) Motorola claims that this improves audio quality on your cell calls . Unless your cell phone has inherently poor quality components , this probably is n't true . Your audio quality is going to be determined largely by the quality of the cell network you 're on , and how much distance is between the Motorola base and your Bluetooth phone.2 ) Turning your cell phone on vibrate does n't stop all the Motorola phones in your house from ringing . I knew this before , but did n't realize how quickly I 'd be annoyed by the number of calls I 've assigned a silent ringtone to causing all of my home phones to ring . After just a few days , I unpaired my iPhone from the base.With so many alternatives out there ( including Bluetooth-capable models from Uniden and others ) , I really ca n't think of a single compelling reason to get this .	-1
I really wanted to like the Motorola DECT 6.0 Cordless phone as I loved the idea of being able to convergemy cell phone calls to my home phone . I have numerous friends who call me on my cell phone even though I am home and I got tired of asking them to `` kindly hang up and call me back on my home phone '' as I do n't find it comfortable to talk on my Blackberry for more than a few minutes . Plus , I 'm a tad paranoid after reading the reports linking talking on cell phones to a slight increase in brain tumors . SO , I was thinking `` hey , what a great concept ! My friends can call my cell phone and I can talk to them on my home phone . '' It 's bloody brilliant actually except for the fact that 4/10 it disconnects to my bluetooth even if the phone is a mere 5 feet away . At the end of the day , it caused me more frustration than the convenience it promised . I ended up switching back to my old Panasonic and kindly asking my friends to call me back on my land line . Sigh .	-1
WOW - when you read the specifications of this kit , and look at the price , you realize you 've found a real winner . This kit has it all - Bluetooth , answering machine , DECT and multiple handsets.But unless you read the reviews , you 'll be in for a nasty surprise . As a basic phone system , this works perfectly . Setup is a breeze and you 'll be up and running in a matter of minutes . But if you purchased it to use with the Bluetooth feature , you 'll become sad.Put simply , connections never stay active with a Bluetooth device . I tested this with a variety of Bluetooth phones , and each and every one showed issues . Some did n't connect at all , some connected then dropped , and others connected one , then never again.Sorry Motorola , but this is one product that needs to return to the drawing board .	-1
The Motorola DECT 6.0 looks great and has a few great features , but is also challenging to use . I 'll compare it to Panasonic , which has been the go-to replacement phone for years.The styling of the Motorola is much nicer . The Motorola is thin and light , and also stands upright . The sound on the Motorola handset and on the speakerphone are both excellent , and match Panasonic . The range worked just fine , with the sound clear throughout the house , the same as Panasonic.Then other differences separate the two phones . On the plus side , the Motorola will pair with a mobile phone using Bluetooth . With Motorola every individual phone can retrieve voice messages , instead of only having the message stored on one base unit . On the minus side , there is no blinking red light when I get home , so I have to remember to pick up the receiver to see if there is a message . Motorola also had a delay when pushing buttons , making it more difficult to use . The Motorola menu also took a little time to get used to . The battery life on the Motorola is around one third or less than the battery life of the Panasonic.Overall , the Motorola looks great but just does not work well enough to justify the price .	-1
I have to use dry erase markers in my classroom -- not because I like them , but because there 's no choice . I 'm slowly weaning myself off chalk at home , and thought I 'd give these a try . My normal handwriting is *very* small.The point is `` fine '' enough to write a dozen lines on a smallish space ( like a 1'x 1 ' whiteboard ) just fine . The tip does n't seem to be breaking down , either , and I am heavy-handed . They do n't look it , but they are indeed finer-pointed than the stock markers that come with smaller whiteboards . The colors are nice ( and no yellow ! yay ! ) with a good opacity , and they do n't smell.I ca n't see these markers lasting very long , however . The drawback to ALL whiteboard markers is that they are disposable . They waste packaging ( using plastic so you can see the pretty colors ) , and they use plastic for their bodies themselves . I 've had cheap , colored `` China '' markers ( with which you can write on a whiteboard or glass ) last for YEARS without drying out because they 're not liquid to begin with -- and I also have a set of dry erase Crayolas that are larger and do the same thing . Neither use plastic , as far as I know . I realize that these drawbacks go with the territory of all whiteboard markers , but I feel like I need to write the obvious -- especially for smaller pens that will probably run out sooner , get lost , etc.These markers are nice and do what they say they do , but it 's up to us to demand something that is refillable and/or a bit less expendable ... or seek alternatives.UPDATE : Well , it 's happened . After having these pens for a few weeks ( I had them in a pen jar on my desk ) , I discovered that ALL of them had dried out . I had written maybe a few sentences with each of them , and am perplexed as to why they would dry out even though they were tightly capped , and not exposed to excessive cold or heat . Just removed a couple stars because of this .	-1
When using the whiteboard in my office at work , it is often nice to have several different colored markers in order to keep ideas organized and clear . The BIC Great Erase Grip `` Pocket '' Dry Erase Marker , Fine Point , Assorted , 6 Dry Erase Markers ( GDEP61-Ast ) seemed like just what I needed.The set has a good selection of colors . The fine point makes it easy to write clearly and the ink shows up very well on the white board.Where these markers fail for me is in the cleaning . They almost always leave behind a significant shadow of the words and drawings you made with them when you try to clean the board . The only thing I 've been able to find to remove the ink completely is WD-40.If they did n't write so well , I 'd give them one star . I actually feel a bit generous giving them two stars given the staining issue , but they do write very well . I just feel like a dry erase marker should be easier to wipe away than these are .	-1
I 'm a long time user of Expo markers but I needed a new set of fine tipped white board markers so I decided to try out the BIC great erase fine points.While my Expo markers give a bold colorful line , the BIC markers give a faded/watery line that has no vibrancy and seems to disappear as you get further from the white board . The difference between these and my old fine tipped Expos is night and day . I would n't even consider these if I were to purchase fine tipped markers in the future.One other thing- I did a quick test of each color side-by-side to test how easily they erase over time . All of the colors erase easily after 7 days of testing except the tepid orange color . I have to press very firmly with the eraser and scrub back and forth to get the orange to erase.On a positive note , these had no scent which is one of their advertised features . My Expos are quite smelly ( though if you get the fruity Expo , that can be fun ) .My advice is to stick with Expo for your dry erase markers ...	-1
I want to start this off by saying I LOVE post-it notes . LOVE THEM ! So when I saw this product I thought it was an interesting idea and decided to give them a try . I have to say that unfortunately this product is NOT WORTH IT.First complaint is that there is NO readily available instructions for `` installation '' it may seem like a simple idea but I could n't figure out which flaps were suppose to go where . It was n't until I had removed the second adhesive strip that I found the pictorial instructions . The hard to find instructions left me cranky.Second complaint is that the number of post-its in each little packet are minimal . Maybe if you do n't use many post-its that might be enough for you- but I use a lot . I would be constantly replacing the packet.Third complaint is that the stickem on the back of the pack leaves residue on my laptop after removal.Fourth complaint is that it seems that the sleeve that holds the post-its would not hold up to the sliding a laptop in and out of a snug case like I have . I admit though that I did n't leave the packet on my laptop long enough to find out because it was empty.The only redeeming quality about these `` dispensers '' is that the patterns are `` cute '' but as I mentioned I do n't really think these are functional . I would rather just use a traditional post-it note pad .	-1
Post-it Notes are undeniably a terrific organizing tool.But Post-it Notes for a laptop ? Unfortunately , they just did n't prove themselves to be a practical organizing solution for me.The dispenser is designed to adhere to your laptop ( NOT the screen ) with two strips of adhesive and holds just 20 notes . Although marketed as `` refillable , '' you actually have to refill the dispenser from the bottom , which means you have to unstick it from whatever you 've stuck it to and then refill it and re-stick it . Not very practical.They just are n't needed for a laptop ; I , like most computer users , make all my notes on a desktop version of post-it notesPost-it Software Noteswhen I 'm on my laptop , not on pieces of paper.I really ca n't even see the point of it for a laptop-based office receptionist working for a group of salesmen ; she 'll run out of notes on a daily basis & they have to be applied to the BACK of the laptop , which is n't very ergonomic.I 've racked my brain & the only practical use I can find for these is as a refrigerator-mounted message center for the family on the go . If 3M will re-market this as a Fridge Message Center , it may work . But this is just an impractical no-go for laptop users . Reboot !	-1
The idea of a a little post-it note holder is cute . It 's not a necessity because you can just throw a pack in your briefcase or computer bag . But , it is convenient to have a little holder nearby . However , the holder is a thin laminated cardboard which has already ripped and if you are a heavy post-it user , you 'd be refilling this a lot.I think I 'll stick to throwing a pack in my bag instead of this .	-1
Colorful prints but not adequate for placing on my Laptop as it constantly slides off . I would n't recommend purchasing this item . Save your money .	-1
Another in a long line of `` how do we appeal to the digital world '' products from 3M ! Purportedly `` laptop note dispensers '' , these Post-Its are simply 20-sheet dispensers made out of cardboard that adhere to anything ( including your laptop ) . The cardboard sleeves themselves have somewhat garish graphic patterns in bright colors on them -- I doubt you 'll be wanting to spoil the appearance of your brand new sleek and stylish MacBook Pro or Sony Vaio laptop with these anytime soon.The real kicker is what a poor value these dispensers are . Original Post-It notes cost about six dollars per 1,200 sheets . These `` laptop Post-Its '' can be purchased for about three dollars for 60 sheets . Therefore , the `` Laptop Note Dispensers '' are a whopping 10 times more expensive per sheet than conventional Post-It notes.Your needs may differ to mine , but I honestly never found it a problem throwing the 3-inch square original pads in my laptop case along with my laptop and just having them to hand when I needed them . And for much note-taking on a laptop , I use on-screen Stickies on my MacBook faster than I can dispense a Post-It and write on it .	-1
These are little paper envelopes with sticky tapes on the back that hold a very small amount of post-it notes . The premise is that you can stick them to your laptop for convenience . I suppose if you are on a flight with your laptop open and need a post-it note , this might make sense . But , to me it has never been a burden to pull a post-it note off the stack to jot down my notes . The envelopes are made from a cheap slick paper , and they only hold a small amount of post-its . I simply do n't get what 3M is trying to achieve with their latest do-nothing products . Frankly , I will stick with my post-it note pad , pulling them off one at a time -- I need the exercise . I can not recommend this product , the quality is poor and the reasoning behind the entire idea seems faulty to me .	-1
I stuck these on my laptop and first thing I know they would get hung up on my case when I was storing it . It is also and eyesore . If I need to note things I will do so in my datebook or on my phone . If you really thought you needed a sticky pad for something just take a couple from home and stick them to your laptop or put them in your carrying case.These serve no purpose .	-1
Nothing is wrong or amiss with the Post-its in this kit . I love Post-its and use them all the time . But these Post-its come in a cardboard packet which has a very sticky strip of tape on the back , designed to be attached to one 's laptop . The idea of attaching a sticky-backed cardboard Post-it holder to my lovely laptop leaves me cold . I just do n't think it 's more handy than having a couple of Post-it packs stuffed in my purse or laptop case.Furthermore , I really do n't like the idea of trying to use `` Gloo-gone '' on my pristine laptop once I want this packet off , because you know that sooner or later , that cardboard case will start looking tattered and tacky . I just keep imagining how awful a bumper sticker looks on a car after a few months . This product is the equivalent of putting bumper stickers on your laptop . If that does n't bother you , then you might like this idea.However , I was not impressed with this product.Thumbs down ( on the packet , not on the Post-its . Post-its rule ) .P.S . On the other hand , my little niece thought this whole deal looked very cool on her school notebook , and glommed right onto it . Maybe instead of targeting adult laptop owners , this product should be aimed at children in the elementary school supply aisle .	-1
why fix it ? Regular , plain ol ' post it notes work amazingly well . This new little pack , not so much.This was my first time using the accordian style Post-its and I have to ask `` why ? '' The notes come out wrinkled , which really annoys me . The `` dispenser '' is a very flimsy , cheap little thing that make me wonder if my weak hands were going to rip it off my laptop . We wo n't even mention that it only holds 20 notes ! Really , honestly , nice Post-it people , I love your product and will continue to use it . But I will not be purchasing this particular incarnation . It 's very similar to putting a tutu on a pig , completely unnecessary .	-1
I 've meant to try the newer `` accordion '' style Post-it for a while even though I never had any real issue with the traditional `` checkbook '' style . Now that I have tried the new style , I frankly do n't know why I will ever want it . You can peel one off in the traditional style with one hand after very little practice . With the new style you either need a heavy or attached dispenser , or you need to guess which side to peel if you use the refill alone . Ahhh ! This particular product is troublesome on three counts . 1 . Each refill is small in quantity . At 20 note apiece , it 's just too small even discounting those peeled off by colleagues during meetings ( it surely is a great conversation starter ) . 2 . You can not refill the dispenser in this product without detaching it . 3 . Worse , the glue on the dispenser left oily traces on my ThinkPad 's lid ! ( Thankfully a pencil eraser got them all out . ) In the two days the first dispenser stayed on my laptop , my colleagues thoroughly enjoyed taking notes from my laptop during meetings . I gave out the other two refills while throwing away the two dispensers that come with them . Speaking as someone who has a half drawer full of Post-it of different sizes and colors : sorry , 3M , I am not buying this .	-1
I 've often thought that having Post-It 's handy on my laptop would be a good thing , and I 've even torn off a few and placed them on the lower corner of my key board - but after trying this product - I found it cumbersome . Here 's why : The are wrapped in a slick , card stock paper `` dispenser '' that caused my palms to constantly catch on it . Even though the stick tape keeps it secure , it still is raised enough to be a bother . Plus , the post-it sheet that 's fed through the slot was always rubbing and catching my hand as I typed . I ended up removing the dispenser within hours because it was in my way and very uncomfortable to work around.Someone else might find it useful , but if you tend to rest your palms on the laptop keyboard as you type , you might not like it .	-1
I was excited about these post-it notes since I use them frequently , but they get icky since they do n't have a dispenser . Unfortunately this dispenser is extremely flimsy and is just a waste of paper . It will be destroyed in a few days , you are better off just using regular Post-Its and saving yourself the frustration .	-1
This looks like a good idea , thePost-it ( R ) Pop-up Laptop Notes Dispenser , 3 x 3 Inch ( LND-330-3PK ) , but it 's not what I thought it was going to be . Post-its are great ! This is a smaller package of Post-its that are fanned , every other way in the pad . I really like Post-its , and I am loyal to the original 3M brand ( the other generics that are out there do n't stick as well as the original ones do ) . But the holder is just a very light weight cardboard , or a heavy weight paper that the Post-it pad is inserted into . The holder has tape on the back , remove the protective film that covers the tape , and stick the holder anywhere . It will hold there , and can easily be removed and re-stuck elsewhere , at least a few times before the stick-em no long holds well.So , why only 2 stars ? It 's the holder ! It 's just a light weight piece of paper that is folded to hold the pad . I expected something a little more substantial in weight or design . You know you are paying a premium for that holder , on top of the price of the pad of Post-its . But the premium is not worth it . Sure , the holders are colorful , might look nice in the ad , but come-on , it 's just a piece of paper folded to hold Post-its . I would have rather they used a plastic type of holder , even light-weight plastic , then I would have felt the premium that you pay for this would have been worth it .	-1
I thought the pop-up idea to keep with your laptop was a cute idea . But when I got it -- the idea is to attach it to the outside of your laptop top -- with a warning it might peal off paint when removed ! ! ! Moreover -- you can even see in the picture that comes along with the product - it is completely impracticable . The whole purpose of a laptop is to move it around , take it in and outside of its case , etc . This little pop-up would be ripped apart within the first few moves and the pop-up post-it exposed would be completely wrinkled and/or damaged.Plus this little case holds less than 20 post it notes -- not enough to be functional.It comes with three flimsy thick folded paper as `` cases for the pop-up . They would last about a week . I offered a choice of one to a young grad student friend of mine and she would n't even take it even though she uses and carries around post it notes all the time.Basically , I am throwing this away . Somehow I can not believe that Post-it ever bothered to market test this item since its dysfunctionalit is apparent just from looking at it .	-1
I 've used and enjoyed Post-Its for years , but this new product seems completely worthless . The package contains three `` dispensers '' which are merely folded-up paper sleeves into which you insert an accordion-fold stack of Post-Its . You then affix the dispenser to your laptop or any other surface and voil & agrave ; ! Note paper at your fingertips ! Pros : It has Post-Its.Cons : The dispensers are thin and flimsy.There are only 20 Post-Its in a stack.The adhesive may leave marks.When you pull a Post-It , it can wrinkle easily.The dispensers are gray and yucky chartreuse and hot pink . You do n't need the dispenser to use the notes.You have to unstick the dispenser from laptop to refill it.I do n't see the value of this product and I am amazed that it was created . Do you really have to stick note papers to your laptop ? If so , it would be easier to stick a regular stack of Post-Its or just carry a stack of them in your case or pocket . Twenty sheets to a pack is too few ; you 're always refilling the dispenser . This seems like a needless and overpriced product .	-1
The best thing I can say about the Post-It Dispenser is that its ultra-low price is ideal for bringing your oder total up to $ 25.00 , so tha tyou can take advantage of Amazon.com 's free shipping.However , you get what you pay for . The dispenser is made out of thick paper , and looks extremely unprofessional . If you 're in grades K-12 that may not be a drawback , and that 's the only demographic to whom this might appeal.To construct this thing , feed one end of the enclosed Post-Its -- they 're stuck to each other , thus forming one long accordian- or fan-shaped deck of Post-Its . Fold the flaps over , and the backside has adhesive that will stick on a desk , a laptop , your lunch bag , wherever . Again , school-age kids might think this is fairly kewl , but most people will find this an unattractive addition to the home or office.CONS : Unattractive , Not Very Useful . It 's pretty cheap looking , and though you can hide it fom yourself by putting it on the lid of your computer , you wo n't be hiding it from others . Mreover , if you 're at your computer , you can easily use the notepad feature , cyber-Post-Its , or email to send yourself the ideas you 've jotted down . Ah , but what if you need more portability , a note to take with you after you 've left your office ? That has more to do with the utility of Post-Its than with the dispenser . The main point is that most people do n't need this ; it 's an invention in search of an ( adult ) consumer.Sticky Fingers . This may not bother you , but that linked Post-It roll ( described above ) means that sometimes you 'll pull out a POST-IT with the sticky side up . Personally , I 'd rather rip them off a pad , knowing where the sticky band is on each post it.Wrinkles Galore . If you do n't grab these by the side , there 's a very good chance that you 'll badly bend , tear , or wrinkle the Post-It . Pulling one from the top edge ( the most natural motion ) results in two fairly sloppy looking Post-Its : The one you just pulled , and the one in the dispenser.Personally , I 'd rather spend another $ 10 or so for something more durable , attractive , and functional ( there are such products sold right here at Amazon.com ) . Recommended only for non-college students who like bright colors , gadgets , have a thing for Post-Its , and/or value trend over form and function .	-1
This is a flat piece of folded thin cardboard which stores and dispenses a few Post-it notes . It 's as clever as a handshake buzzer but in terms of utility , it achieves almost nothing.If you were to possess the same number of Post-it notes absent the dispenser , then you 're just as well off . I see no purpose whatever in this device and if millions of them do not show up at Big Lots six months from now then we 'll likely see them emerge as Cracker Jack prizes.But Post-it notes themselves are still as terrific and as useful as they always were -- I could n't live without them !	-1
The Post-it Laptop Note Dispenser is a great idea , and it could have been a slam dunk . However it comes up short of its potential . The first issue I noticed is a minor one , but I still found it annoying . While it is not the most complicated product , you have to remove the adhesive strip on the back in order to get to the instructions . They probably could have done with one fewer pictures on the back of the outer packaging and placed the instructions there too . The other issue is much more of a deal breaker . The dispenser is designed to work with the accordion style Post-it Notes so the opening has to be in the middle to accommodate this . As a result , almost half of the note is inaccessible for writing without dispensing . Even if you do n't write on the note before dispensing , the notes come out bent , wrinkled , or torn if not all three . The one design aspect that 3M succeeded on was the adhesive . It does come off without leaving residue , and it re-affixes securely afterward . I just wish they had pulled off the overall design with the same degree of success . Unfortunately , I can not recommend this product .	-1
i like sticky notes , but this is just a ploy to try to get you to buy `` something new . '' these are just regular ol ' sticky notes packaged in very ( and i mean VERY ) thin stacks inside of a piece of paper with a tape strip to stick onto your laptop . seriously ? why should i buy this instead of the much thicker stack that i can use instead ? i see no good reason to buy this .	-1
Well , I 've got a laptop and I take notes from time to time , but I do n't know why someone would NEED to have post-its stuck on their computer . Guess some people would find it handy , but just having a notepad or some sticky 's nearby works for me .	-1
I am a heavy post-it user , and do not find this product to be useful . Here is why:1 . Post-its are easy to transport . I just throw a pad in my briefcase or laptop case . I do n't need a dispenser that takes up more room , is very flimsy , and holds much fewer post-its than come on a standard pad.2 . I keep three different sizes of post-its next to my laptop and desktop . I have never felt any need to attach them directly to my laptop or desktop tower.3 . I find it easier to peel off individual post-its when they are not in this dispenser.4 . Given the limited amount of post-its in a dispenser , this is not economical for heavy use compared to the price of buying post-its without a dispenser.5 . If you want to stick a post-it pad to a surface , you can easily do so by using the Scotch Removable Restickable Glue Stick . It creates the same kind of backing as this dispenser -- except you can choose any size post-it you want , and the post-its are easily dispensable.Bottom line : If you are only an occasional post-it user and do n't mind be limited to one size , then this product might be useful .	-1
I guess this product could be helpful for some people ... but it was a bit annoying to have something stuck to my laptop lid..and it seemed to get in the way . Putting the laptop in a case knocks this off or opens it ... I 'd rather just have a pad of these or a dispenser sitting on my desk . This product seems to be a stretch ... .	-1
This has to be the most ill-conceived product from Post-It yet . These are flimsy post-it note dispensers that you 're supposed to stick to the back of your laptop screen . Great ! Just what I always wanted - to put something ugly and sticky on my laptop . I did n't actually stick it to my laptop , but when I tried it on other surfaces , it definitely does n't come off cleanly enough to gum up your computer , unless you 're one of those people who puts stickers on their laptops anyway . In that case , I suppose it does n't matter.Furthermore , when was the last time you were sitting at your laptop thinking , `` wow - I really wish there was some way I could make myself a note . . . I guess there 's nothing to be done ! '' Of course not . You 'd write yourself a note on your laptop itself ! I have no idea why anyone would want a sticky note dispenser glued to their laptop.Finally , the dispensers are very small and it appears that they require small stacks of sticky notes . Perhaps you can use regular post-its from a big stack , but it 's difficult to determine . This whole thing just seems silly and useless , except for one instance : if you affix one of these to the inside of a textbook , it might be handy in school . Maybe you could use it in a binder or notebook , but then again , you could just take notes in your notebook ! If anyone has found a good use for these , please comment on my review and I 'll consider toning down my negative impression of the Post-It Laptop dispenser . In the meantime , I 'll be scratching my head over this one .	-1
This is an interesting idea to keep post-it notes handy on the lid of your laptop , or on any other surface . The problem is that the holder is clumsy to load , clumsy to dispense , and results in a less-than-perfect post-it note . I 'm not at all pleased with this product.The holders are basically a thin plastic . They 're very pliable . The adhesive on the back of the holder works well . However , the package excludes clear instructions on how to load the holder once it 's attached to something . There are two side flaps that do n't remain secured , but it 's very difficult to reload the holder once it 's attached to a surface.My other complaint is that although the post-it notes dispense well , it results in a post-it note that ends up wrinkled as a result of the way it is dispensed . The post-it note has a wrinkled appearance and just does n't look neat when attached to a piece of paper or other surface . If presentation is essential , this product will make you look messy.You also need to apply a bit of force to dispense a post-it note . Fortunately , the dispenser never fails to dispense the edge of the next note , so there is no awkward digging for the next post-it note . Unfortunately , the dispenser requires a specific type of post-it note refill.Is this a product I can use ? Yes . Is this a product that I like using ? No . Maybe there are better post-it note dispensers , but I certainly ca n't recommend this one .	-1
As others have stated , this really is a cheap little bundle . The adhesive is cheap , the `` container '' for the Post-it notes is cheap . It 's just cheap in so many way . You 're truly better off buying a stack of post-it notes and a little , smart-looking container for them.The biggest issue with this set is that by pulling on the Post-it notes the way you 're supposed to just ends up bending or wrinkling them on their way out of the wrapper . So what 's the point , Mr. Post-it ? What were you thinking ? 2 stars out of 5 , and only then because at least you can use the Post-its and throw away the silly adhesive containers ...	-1
Some clever brain came up with this idea and I weep to think of the wasted time and effort involved , not to mention the waste of said originating brain who has good concepts that ought to be applied to real problems in the world.This did not work for me . Yes , I can be technologically challenged , so it took me about 20 minutes to figure out how to insert the darn thing properly . The plastic casing is slippery and when you pull out a single Post-it sheet the whole thing moves up and almost out . And then there are the warnings which say watch out for damage to surfacesyou stick it on and be careful because colors may bleed and it might lift ink.Folks , do we really need millions of these nonbiodegradable , truly unnecessary squares of frivolous impulse buying dreck to dump into our already over-crowded landfills ? In these days of increasing ecological awareness , what was 3M thinking ? Maybe they could be sealed together and used to plug the oil leak in the Gulf ? No one who cares about our planet would ever buy one .	-1
When I first saw this item , I admit I was taken by the idea : Hands free taping ! Great when working on projects or wrapping gifts . However the implementation of the tape holding devices left us often frustrated and annoyed . First the better of the two is the wrist dispenser , which attached to your wrist like a bracelet . This is convenient as you have use of both hands while working a project . However , as others have pointed out , the manufacturing is cheap , and the units are difficult to load . The second dispenser is the deskgrip one . This should be more appropriately called the desk floating dispenser . I have tried this on all kinds of surfaces and it will not stay put . I always end up pulling the thing off the surface without any tape dispensed . Just annoying !	-1
I got this because I hoped it would help with wrapping Christmas presents . I opened the package thinking I would try the ones that attached to your wrist first . After a few minutes of struggling to get the contraption opened , I inserted the tape , but was unable to close it again . I tried on and off for twenty minutes , finally giving up . The one that suctioned to a surface was better , but if the surface had any texture ( ie-wood , molded platic ) the suction gave out after a tug or two . Overall , the aggravation was not worth it and I decided to stick to the old tape dispensers .	-1
First , they were REALLY smelly when I opened the package ... like `` where is my white jumpsuit and gas mask smelly '' - that I can get over . I loved how they were super easy to peel off and the curved die cut of the two labels is nice ... BUT for my HP LaserJet CP1525nw they keep jamming and jamming and jamming . My head actually exploded the first day I used them . The seller names on these off-brand labels seem to change , so it is hard to keep up with the labels I like and the ones I do n't . I can hear my husband saying , `` You get what you pay for . '' I loathe when he is right . I also loathe writing a marginal review , but I do n't want anyone else 's head to explode ... would be on my conscience.ADDITION : I had posted this earlier today and just spent another hour trying to get a few labels to print . I had to individually straighten each sheet ( they were stored in pack they came in FLAT ) and stand on one foot while jumping up and down to get them to feed through . Yes , I ordered different labels and they will be here tomorrow ... but for today , I got ta deal with these . I know I am not walking seven miles each day to carry water in a goat bladder , but it is still annoying ... first world country problem , but it is still making me sad .	-1
How are these inferior to the similar Avery labels ? Sheet of labels feeds crooked into the printer more often and labels are not as easy to grasp when removing for application to envelopes . Also the paper they 're printed on is not as thick as Avery labels . But at least 3M has the good sense to use the Avery template .	-1
I bought this as a gift to my daughter and was surprised to see I did not get what the picture claims I got . It 's NOT in the package shown ; instead , it 's in a white HP package , almost as if somebody bought them in bulk and separated the package . It works fine , but since the picture showed me something I did n't get , I devalued it in stars .	-1
terrible in terms of quantity to price value . would never buy again . in fact , i got rid of the entire printer . this thing is so expensive , that after a cost analysis , i was better off investing in more expensive upfront laser printer .	-1
I have used Kensington Wireless Presenters for a long time . The previous ones all had red lasers . But last semester I had a student who had one type of color blindness that prevented him from distinguishing my pointer from other items on my Power Point slides in lectures . He suggested I try a green laser as the one used by the biochemist was quite visible for him . So I purchased this Kensington model with the green laser.The case for the unit is excellent , but the wireless presenter inside has MANY problems . The unit looks sleek , but the buttons operate with no tactile feedback and with very short travel . The laser button has a very dangerous defect of frequently and unpredictably locking ON , risking the vision of members of the audience if you are not careful . The only way to un-lock it is to press hard on the button and hold for a second or so and then it usually unlocks . A call to technical service at Kensington revealed that this is a KNOWN problem ... and one has to closely monitor the `` sticky '' buttons on this unit . Obviously this needs attention and should result in a safety recall . The technician I spoke with was well meaning ... but I think his name may have been `` Peggy '' if you know what I mean.This unit is different from the earlier red laser units in that positioning the receiver into the end of the unit does NOT cut the power . There is a separate switch on the side of this unit that you have to remember to shut off after each and every use . The red laser units would last a whole semester before a battery replacement was needed because it powered down when you put it away . This green laser went through a pair of batteries in just four weeks . Clearly the green laser probably draws more on the battery , but I 'm guessing I failed to switch off the unit when I put it in the case on one or more occasions . I always put the receiver in its place in the unit at the end of the lecture ; that is NOT enough for this unit . Moreover I recently noticed that once , when I was zipping up the case to put it away , the stuck laser button had also left the laser on . Obviously you MUST remember to turn off the manual switch AS WELL as putting the receiver back in its recess to cut the battery power from this unit.The `` manual '' that comes with the unit is virtually useless ... it has very few instructions , but in so many languages that it takes up a whole sheet of paper folded . It is as if no one at Kensington tried the product and just released it without a care.So this item appears to be far below the quality I have come to expect of Kensington products I have purchased , used , and reviewed over the years . This is a very sad development for me . I 'm sorry but I can not recommend spending the additional money for the green laser version of this product . The older models with the red laser have been far superior in my experience . I 'm going to poll the class to see if I have another person with the problem and will try to go back to my older unit . I 'm considering a return of the green laser unit to Amazon as is another reviewer of this inferior product .	-1
I ordered this to use as a in/out board at work . I change the board frequently , so I wanted something small , bright , and easy to clean . This board and markers fell flat . Here 's what I found lacking : - Neon Markers : The ink from the markers themselves is really transparent . I tried using different combinations of all three colors on the black board , and nothing looked very vibrant or neon . Since the ink did n't show up very brightly on black , I was skeptical about the claims that this could be used on a white erase board as well . Sure enough the color contrast on the white board was even worse than the black erase board.- Cleaning the Board : A regular dry-erase board eraser was not enough to clear the ink from the board and I wound up having to use a dry-erase spray cleaner and some serious elbow grease just to get off some simple fresh notes.I would not recommend this product at all .	-1
If you are wanting a simple product such as a dry erase board , but with a slight twist , then this product will work for you ! ! ! I love dry erase boards , I keep them on my fridge for making list and things like that for groceries until I make a hard list to go to the store and they are wonderful . : ) I already have one that works quite well , but I love neon colors and I always loved to write with gel pens on black paper so I decided to give this board a try ! Now in terms of how bright the neon shows up ... Well , its not amazingly bright after the beginning of the first stroke , but that is generally normally for things of this nature , it is on black so it does get absorbed in to the blackness a bit , but this is also normal for gel pens as well , its just kind of the way it goes . They are extremely bright if you use them on a normal white board , which I decided to test to make sure it was n't the markers , and its not , its just that its on black , and you really ca n't help that.Other than that , they write pretty well , they seem just a bit drier than my other markers , so you kind of have to press harder than other markers , or at least my other markers to get them off , but that is also a very minor complaint , and hardly worth mentioning . So overall , good for what it is , and if you want a black dry erase board or just a bit of a sleeker look than your normal dry erase board , then I highly recommend it . : ) EDIT ( 6/710 ) : Ironically enough , over time the pens seems to write better , however , the whole board feels oily and the ink wont wipe off very easily even with an eraser . I am sure it is not me , I have never had this problem with my other boards or pens , but this one just seems to have greasy pens and they do n't erase easily , and for this reason I took a star off my review from 5 to 4 stars . If it were not for this problem I would keep it at 5stars . : ( EDIT Fri July 6 , 2012 : I have had a number of dry erase boards , I have 2 white ones and this black one . The white ones work perfectly and I never have problems erasing anything from them . This black one on the other hand can not be easily erased . In fact the `` ink '' hardens so much that I can not get it off with an eraser or cloth or even really by scraping , and it got to the point where I 'd have to clean the board with a cleaner , which in turn makes the problem worse.I would not even remotely recommend this board , the only reason it gets 2 stars is because its black , and I like that , but it does work well , not even a bit.God Bless ~Amy	-1
For years I have used the Expo brand of white board markers and love them.I decided to try these because it was listed as Bold . Well bold it was not.The colors paled in comparison to the expo colors although it did write well.The product was also listed as low oder . I found a funky smell emitted as I wrote.Which I did n't experience with the Expo brand.The best part of the kit was the spray and eraser , but even that was lack luster.The spray erase kit smudges the erased writing and you spend so much time getting theboard white again . I would have liked the eraser to have been magnetized so that itwould stick to the white board.The product works , it just does n't work well enough to deliver on it 's packagingpromises . And that funky smell , makes the pens a toss out !	-1
We use dry erase boards throughout our house and office , and are frequently purchasing refill markers . We have used EXPO brand , BIC , and now these QUARTET . Hands down , BIC are the best . Easily five stars . Almost nearly as good are the EXPO brand , say , four and half stars . But dropping way down are these . They do not write smoothly , they are not `` bold '' as advertised , and they barely leave any ink on the board . I can not recommend these at all .	-1
A solid decent but plain binder that does not hold up well to stains-my kids spilled some pop on it in the kitchen and by the time I got to it there was a cherry Coke stain after cleaning it up . So I tried and spilled some coffee on it and it stained too.Just because a product says Recycled means that it is good-that usually means cheaply reproducted . I can tell it would not hold up well in my household.It is in the trash can as we speak.Skip !	-1
As somebody who likes to keep stuff organized , even if to the eye my apartment is far from neat , thought these patterned dividers would be a good idea . But let 's be clear here , these colorful partitions are far from a good value . You get 5 , count 'em FIVE , and they wind up costing over a dollar each . The patterns are just okay , but nothing special or particularly eye catching . That 's ridiculous in my book because one could easily punch up some colored poster board , and get the same results at a fraction of the price.A measly amount for at a high price . No thanks .	-1
I waited for the e-print functionality to be enabled before writing this review.All in all , it 's an OK printer for the price point.Text prints clear and sharp , and it did n't have poor alignment when printing in draft mode . Unlike my all in one HP 6500 printer . The system aligns itself with a scan of a printed page , which was kind of cool . The photos print out fairly sharp , though the ink usage will likely cause you to spend about 40 cents per print . I would go with a store that can do it for 10 cents a print unless it is an emergency.Eprint works well for text . I just send an email with an attachment like Word or PDF to my printer and it prints . Eprint does n't work for photos as you can only load one type of paper in the tray . Most of us will set it for normal printing anyways , so it 's more annoying than necessary.The negatives of this printer are numerous . There are only four input buttons , which cost me to 15 minutes to change the setting for wireless . The advertised 1 watt drain in off mode does n't really apply because the printer has to be on at all times for wireless print . The photo software was horrible . I could n't get a decent photo print after the first round , and I consider myself a techie.My advice- this is a decent printer if you just want to print/ scan/ copy . If you need a good photo printer , I 'd invest a little more . If you need fax or double sided printing , the same applies- invest more for a better printer .	-1
I bought this six months ago . All I wanted was a printer for photos . The software is quite large and likes to start the installation again when I restart my computer . The software is already installed and all printer functions work properly . The paper almost always has trouble getting picked up . Print quality is ok for photos . I will be replacing this printer .	-1
The highly touted ePrint feature has not yet been implemented.- Print photos , documents and more from anywhere , anytime using email - NOT TRUE AT THIS TIME ! HP is being very deceptive . Avoid this printer and HP .	-1
I got this printer at a decent price . it 's definitely not worth what this seller is asking for it . I give this printer a full star because the scanner works nicely . However , it gets no stars for printing . It gets a paper jam every 2 - 3 pages . Really annoying . You have to stop what you 're doing , go open up the printer , pull out the offending piece of paper , and then hit the okay button . It starts to print & then 2 pages later you 're back in there doing the same exact thing . Completely frustrating . I 've put up with it for a year , but will be buying myself a new printer this coming month because I ca n't take it anymore .	-1
I had this printer for a little over a year and every time I print something , I always have to set it up over again . It worked fine for the first few months , then after , it kept disappearing from the network which meant I had to retype the network key on their little screen every single time I needed to print something . Might I also say , it 's annoying and time consuming because you have to type it in with little arrow keys that select each and every character.It comes with no USB wire so you ca n't even print wired . I like the fact that the setup was simple , but what 's the point of a simple set up if you have to do it over and over again . I called HP customer service and a tech person was trying to help us set up the printer for literally 5 hours and came with no solution . In fact , he complained the whole time and said it would 've been easier if we had the USB wire . Well , it did n't come with the printer so why are we going to pay extra for something like that ? A wireless printer should print and work WIRELESSLY.I gave up on setting up this printer and as time went on , it was recognized , but then if you print , it would say the printer is n't responding or has an error . I swear , it 's so hard to find a budget-friendly 5-star printer .	-1
FINAL EDIT ( 11/14/2011 ) : This should be my final word on this printer . A couple of weeks ago the printer jammed . I cleared the paper path and there is no more jam , but the jam detector was damaged by the jam , so now the printer believes it is jammed even though it is n't . The printer is out of warranty and it will cost more to repair it than to buy a new printer ( but not another one of these ! ! ! ! ) .Since I ca n't clear the jam error , I also ca n't use it as a scanner or fax . That 's a big problem with these all-in-one devices.Sorry for such a disjointed review . As you can see from reading the review and the comments , my experience has been mixed . But the final conclusion is failure . eWaste.=====================================================EDIT ( December , 2010 ) : I just discovered that this printer wo n't print on 3-hole paper . How ridiculous is that ? ! ? ! ? ! With that in mind , I have dropped my rating from four-stars to one-star and changed the title of the review . Buyer beware ! ! ! ! The flaw is that the paper jam detector is on the left-hand side of the paper path . As the 3-hole paper passes through , it detects a jam when it gets to the hole . The only way to get around this is to manually rotate your print job in your software ( PDF ? ) and turn the paper around so that the holes are on the right side of the paper path.This is a very poor design : someone at Epson should be in deep trouble for this ! ! ! Out of fairness though , I 'm leaving my original review below so that my initial impression of this product can still be seen.=====================================================OLD REVIEW '' Just bought a second one '' ( 4 Stars ) I 've waited two months before reviewing this item , because I wanted to use it long enough to have some real experience with it . After two months , this multi-function printer has been dependable enough that I just bought another one as a birthday present for my daughter . It 's not PERFECT , but it meets enough of my criteria to make me happy . My # 1 criteria is that I did n't want to give my daughter a printer that would bankrupt her for consumables.____________________About the ink : I hate inkjet printers because : the ink is too expensive , the printers do n't hold enough ink to last very long , I always run out at the most inopportune moments , and I have to replace the whole color cartridge when only one color ran out.None of those dislikes are true for this printer . Cool ! * Capacity : There is room for five ink cartridges on this printer ( two black and one of each colors ) . That 's sweet -- especially since most of my printing is B & W . ; * Cost : Replacing colors as-needed is much cheaper than replacing the whole color cartridge . The pricing of the ink for this printer is still pretty high , but it 's not as insane as other inkjets I 've owned . * Monitoring : No surprises with the ink capacity , because the print monitor software tells you what your ink levels are . I 'm not crazy about having this app running all the time , but I hate running out of ink even more than I hate having an app running on my system.____________________What I like : * Print Quality : I do n't usually pay too much attention to quality , because it 's something I expect . Just like I expect the gas at my local gas station to be good . So it 's that much more surprising that the print quality of this printer DAZZLED me . I have an expensive color laser at work , but the color calibration is always off . I never realized how horrible my office documents were until I brought home some work and printed it on this printer . W-O-W ! ! ! None of my other inkjet printers have dazzled me like this before . And this is just the default color quality ( not the high quality setting ) . * Ink : I like this unit 's ink functionality enough to write about it in its own section . * Footprint : It 's not as huge as other multi-function printers I 've owned . However , it 's too tall to fit in the cabinet where my old HP fit . * Speed : Black & white copies print so fast it 's actually frightening ( USB connection ) . It 's a loud & violent process , but it 's daaaang fast ! ! ! Color slows the process down , but it 's still very reasonable . WiFi slows the first page down , but the rest of the pages print normally . * WiFi : The wireless setup was very simple . I only had to run this setup one time to configure the printer . After that , the setup on the rest of my home PCs was very quick . The printer plays very nicely with the rest of my home network . HOWEVER ( big drawback ) , the first page on a wireless print job takes FOR-STINKING-EVER ! ! ! ( about 2-3 minutes ) * Scanning : This is about the umpteenth scanner I 've owned and every one of them has bugged me in one way or another . I 'm not a grouch , but I want things to work . This is the first scanner EVER that has n't made me mad . I love two things about the scanning functionality in this device : First , it was designed with network scanning in mind . So there are no quirky work-arounds to get it to scan from a remote machine . Second , there is a good selection of `` profiles '' where you can pick from basic to professional feature sets . That means my kids can scan without being overwhelmed by the huge set of options . * Fax : I rarely fax , but this fax works fine . I do n't have a dedicated fax line , so I have to tell the kids not to answer the phone if a fax is coming in.____________________What I do n't like : * The lag for WiFi printing is really really bad . This would have been a five-star review if it were n't for that . I promise I 'll update this review if I ever solve this problem . It 's a very serious hurdle though . You know when you need to print something real fast before you leave home ( a map , directions , movie tickets , plane tickets , medical insurance card , etc. ) ? I usually put that little chore off until the last possible minute and my wife is usually impatiently waiting in the car for me to get my act together . If this were my only printer , she would divorce me . Luckily I have another printer on my network and I print all the time-sensitive stuff to that one . * I 'm not crazy about the paper path . Although I like that the page comes straight from the back , through the printer , and lands in the tray in front ( no curled pages ) , it means that a multi-page document is reverse-ordered . I can change that in my print options before I print , but the odds of me remembering this are pretty slim . So I have to hand sort the whole dang thing to get it right . * The paper handling mechanism is LOUD and VIOLENT . I halfway expect to find my kids and pets collated in my documents when I go to the other room to pick them up . Luckily the noise scares the cat and she runs away to safety . * I 'm not the greenest guy in the world , but I 'm a tightwad . So duplex ( two-sided ) printing is REALLY important to me . Although manual duplex printing is theoretically possible with this printer , it 's more of a hassle than it 's worth.So you can see that I have some gripes about this device , but it is still a very dependable machine . I did n't realize how much I liked it until I bought one for my daughter without hesitating .	-1
This printer 's a great way to get you to buy extremely expensive ink cartridges -- if you buy from Epson , you 'll end up paying about $ 50 per set of cartridges ( 1 black , 1 red , 1 yellow , 1 blue ) , or about $ 35 for the three color cartridges / $ 15 for a black-ink cartridge . If you are n't careful with your printer settings and your black-ink cartridge runs out , it 'll use the color cartridges to `` mix '' black for you -- which seems like a great idea until you compare the cost of the color cartridges.On top of that , I found the software this printer installs on your computer to be extremely annoying , to the point that it verges on spyware , constantly sitting in the lower-right-hand corner of the screen , reminding me to travel to Epson.com to purchase more ink cartridges.Other than those two problems , it 's a decent printer/ all-in-one , and there 's nothing wrong with it functionally . Just be aware that each set of new ink cartridges is going to cost you almost as much as the printer itself did in the first place ( at least at Amazon 's current $ 80 price ) .	-1
These are too small to even bee noticed . They might be nice for kids to play with but not for important messages you want your family to see .	-1
Great idea , but on our fridge the purple tablet stays in place ( if we place it in the middle of the freezer door ) , while the white one slides off every time . If it would stay in place , it would be a useful for a good price . But as it stands , only one is useable for us ( and that one even slides down a few inches every time we close the door ) . A stronger magnet would make this a great ( but likely more expensive ) product .	-1
This device needs to be held very firmly while scanning any document . If you move too fast the document/photo will be distorted..	-1
I bought this so I can convert the highlights I make on my textbook to electronic format which makes it great for using quotes for research papers or open book/open note tests where you can search a keyword . I first bought a pen scanner , but it takes time scanning individual lines which can be frustrating when you highlight almost the whole page . So I decided to buy this wand scanner . First , unlike other wand scanners , this one came with an 8 GB microSD card , which made it an even better deal.In terms of the hardware , for my purposes of using it on a textbook , I was disappointed at first . Then I discovered the best way to scan is from the binding , to the outer edge of the page . The image will come out sideways , but the scans are more consistent than going top to bottom because when you do that , the page tends to start bending inward . It 's a good idea to scan each page at least 2x , even 3-4 times if you think you messed up , because there is no way to preview an image and it is better to be safe than sorry . With 8 GB there is plenty of space , I also suggest putting it on the high dpi setting . It 's very important to try to maintain a constant slow speed across the page.This unit DOES NOT COME WITH Mac software for OCR . So I had to get an OCR software and ended up with ABBYY FineReader Express which was not too expensive and had excellent character recognition.I do forsee problems with this unit in terms of scanning smaller books . The problem is the scanning `` window '' is not right at the edge of the scanner . There is a gap on both ends `` short edge '' ( one end does have a shorter gap of about 1/2 '' so you do need at least that much clearance . Also along the long edge , the scanning window is closer to one edge but still requires a clearance of about a 1/4 '' .It is nice that this scanner comes with a nice pouch and cleaning cloth . It does use 2 AA batteries though I am unsure of the battery life . At least the LCD does have a battery level indicator which is good.If I ever have to scan something at a library , this unit will come in very handy because of its portability . On the other hand , if you have a recent smart phone with a high megapixel camera and good image quality , you can probably just take a snapshot and use an OCR program later . For smaller books , that may be your only choice because you probably wo n't be able to get good scans with this wand scanner because of the clearance requirements.Update 2/19/2013 : After using this for about a month , I am still very satisfied with the product . I use regular alkaline batteries ( which were in good shape when I put it in but not brand new shape ) and they are still working . When you scan , the battery level may dip but upon completion of scan it goes back up . I 'm down to 2-1 battery level with a 3 at the max , so I will need to replace the batteries soon . This time I 'll try brand new batteries to see how long they last.Scans are about 1 to 1.5 Mb in size depending on what you scan . But even if we say 2 Mb per scan to be on the safe side , you 'll still be able to scan 4000 pages . If you scan 3 times per page to be on the safe side , you can still scan over 1300 pages . Hopefully you wo n't be sitting in a library scanning that many pages , I 'm not sure how long that would take ! I have not used my pen scanner since I got this device and actually wish I got this earlier , because scanning line by line with a pen scanner was a pain . Once again , I do recommend a decent OCR software , the one I am using which I mentioned previously is cheap and it works very well.UPDATE 3/19/13 : I encountered a serious problem with this scanner . As I mentioned above you should scan slowly and make several scans of a page to be safe . I found out with certain books , even though I definitely move the scanner past the edge of the text , the text cuts off ! I was at the library scanning a book and thankfully I brought my tablet to confirm the images . I tried rescanning very carefully on the effected pages but to no avail . If the edge of the book does not have enough white space you will most likely encounter cut off text . This is very bad and I no longer recommend this product , so I have downgraded the rating from 5 stars to 1 star . I have wasted couple hours because of this defect.UPDATE 3/26/13 : Today I scanned the same book though it was a newer reprinted book compared to the one I scanned last week at the library . As is what I usually do , I scanned each page 3 times , slowly , and 100 % made sure the scanning window passed the edge of the text . I only scanned 1 chapter this time . Of all the scans only a few had the text cut off at the end but the other 2 scans of the same page made up for it . I did not have to rescan any pages like I had to do last week . But I still find it very strange that the text would cut off like that or come very close to the text margin even though I scanned sufficiently past the margin . This scanner is still useful for me , so I will upgrade my rating to 3 stars . If you use this at a library , you really need a laptop to double check the scans , that 's the safest way to do it.UPDATE 5/18/13 : I downgraded this scanner back down to 2 stars . I scan book sideways from the binding to the edge . I am always worried that I will get the text closest to the binding , but that part ends up being scanned in properly . As mentioned in my previous updates , the problem is the text on the outer edge of the book I am scanning . Even though the wand goes sufficiently beyond the text margin , the firmware in the scanner tries to cut off the white space and ends up cutting off the text making my scans useless . It DOES N'T MATTER HOW SLOW OR STRAIGHT you make scans , the last bit of text is very likely to be cut off if you scan sideways . Again this is really the only way to scan books with this device .	-1
I 've been happy with this printer and ink in the past so I 'm giving two stars instead of one . I buy the OEM ink to avoid printing problems ; HOWEVER , the last one that I bought was defective . It leaked black ink all over the inside of my printer.Amazon is amazing and is exchanging it for a new cartridge . ( I love their hassle free return policy ) . But it took hours to clean the inside of my printer and it ruined my entire print job which was on the second side of a two sided print process when all the pages got smeared with streaks of black ink . That means I also lost half the ink from the color cartridges as I had to re-print the entire job.I 've never had this problem from an OEM cartridge before , but it only takes one to change my opinion and leave me severely disappointed in Epson . I 'd expect that this could happen from a re-fill , but from an OEM ? Maybe it 's not worth the money to buy the cartridges new from Epson after all .	-1
I 'm not sure why my experience was so different from other reviewers ' , but I am really unhappy with this tape . It 's a good price , but I have been having a ton of problems with it tearing vertically ( not horizontally , the way it is supposed to tear ) . The tape feels really lightweight and flimsy to me . I am just using it to send packages ( obviously ) , so I do n't care if the tape pieces are uneven , but it is extremely frustrating to have to stop what I 'm doing so I can unpeel all the slivered layers of tape still stuck on the roll . I will be looking for a different brand of tape after I run out of these rolls .	-1
I 'm constantly packaging/shipping things , so I use a lot of tape . This tape , while it unwinds easy and is easier to start , is n't something I 'll use on a regular basis . It 's not terribly durable and the adhesive seems ... off ... to me . I 'd suggest going with the standard Scotch shipping tape , or better still their Super Strength tape - my new favorite .	-1
Bought 3 rolls . First use was to attach a small piece of paper with speed dial numbers to the back of my three telephones . The tape , for this purpose , is useless . I then tried what was left of the US Postal Service tape ( looks the same ) , and it held perfectly . The Scotch product is clearly inferior . Rather than try on a package , I will return for a refund .	-1
If you do n't do enough shipping to buy a tape gun , and use bulk rolls of tape , you 've probably bought some shipping tape in a dispenser similar to this . And you 've also certainly have found out how easily the tape falls off the cutter , and back onto itself , and the pain involved in trying to re-start it . Very frustrating , to say the least.Well , this tape solves the problem in two ways . First , it 's a lot thicker than budget brands of shipping tape , and even thicker than regular Scotch-brand shipping tape , so the end does n't disappear . Second , and this is the important one , the adhesive does n't stick as well as typical shipping tape.This might not be a problem if we were talking about a 3 '' or 4 '' wide shipping tape , but this tape is n't even 2 '' wide . I 'm sorry , but 1.88 '' is not wide enough to seal a cardboard box seam that 's longer than about 6 '' , and that 's the problem . With other tape , you can use two or three passes of 1.88 '' tape . Do that with this tape , and you run the risk of it pealing off itself in transit.And while the adhesive seems to stick well enough to cardbord during my usage , I have my doubts that it will hold up as well in a high-humidity situation.Is n't the whole purpose of tape to stick ? So it ought to be obvious that a less sticky tape is n't an advantage . It may make this tape less frustrating to use when it accidentally re-rolls itself during taping , but is that really the most important feature of a tape ? I 'm sorry , but I just ca n't recommend this tape to anyone using a box with seams longer than about 6 to 8-inches .	-1
Most ink jet printers today are built to the standards of a deposable device ... with the main emphasis being the generation of cash flow through sales of their proprietary ink cartridges . There are exceptions , I guess , but I have n't found them yet . And I certainly did n't find it in the Epson Stylus NX420.Mine runs through ink like water through a sieve ... with an excessive amount never reaching the paper at all . You know what I 'm referring to ... the vanishing ink trick that printers perform through nozzle checks , head cleaning , and print head alignment.Then there 's the `` Sorry , I ca n't print now , one of my color ink cartridges is empty '' saga . Never mind that I do n't need cyan , magenta , or yellow to print a black and white memo.It makes me wonder if the printer `` slept in '' the day that they handed out the firmware meant for him .	-1
The only thing that worked properly on this manual unit was the vacuum bar , which held it securely on the table top . The various holes will allow you to sharpen a variety of pencils , but I use the word `` sharpen '' loosely as the blades must be made of ragged ends ~ we got anything but a smooth , sharp point . There were no clean edges , no fine points , in fact , the pencils came out looking like they were put through a cheese grater . The handle does not smoothly turn and therefore you are forced to hold the barrel steady with the same hand that is holding your pencil . The entire operation is clumsy and the end result is frustration , especially for school children . This one is not getting more than one star , sorry . Go with a battery operated STAPLES brand for the same price and get a clean , sharp point every time .	-1
OK , so sometimes the old fashioned way really is n't best . I got this because I was dissatisfied with the various electric pencil sharpeners we have , and longed for the silken-smooth action of the old-style Bostich sharpeners , complete with revolving openings for different sized pencils and handy vacuum seal that keeps it sturdily attached to your desk as you sharpen . Well after putting a dozen pencils of varying size and width through the blades of this Bostich , all I can say is Ugh . First of all , do n't try to attach the vacuum base on wood . It will not stay put . Every time I fed a pencil into the sharpener opening and started to crank , the seal broke . It only worked on a formica-like surface , which did hold the seal pretty well . Second problem , noise : the thing is so loud my granddaughter came in from another room to ask what was making so much noise . I was sharpening a pencil , Honey . Wow , that 's a noisy pencil sharpener ! Third , clumsy cut : the sharpening blades are incredibly rough , chewing up everything from a simple basic # 2 pencil to a thick charcoal drawing pencil and everything in between . The points on each pencil were anything but fine -- the charcoal fell apart , the drawing pencils never reached a point , and the paper on one type of pencil I 've used for years was torn to bits . No other sharpener has ever done that . This is going in the round file .	-1
With a pair of metal blades , this sharpens well . Expect to have to suction it down with each use . Nice to be able to sharpen different sizes too ! Edited 6/7/14 : Blades fell apart . Junk .	-1
The sharpener itself seems fine . However , no matter what surface I 'vacuum ' attached it to , it came off before a pencil had been completely sharpened . The only surface it attached to for even that amount of time was a glass table top -- no suction on a smooth wooden surface ( my desk , where I would have liked to keep it ) and not much better on the formica counter in the kitchen .	-1
The problem with this sharpener IS NOT that the vacuum does n't work , because the vacuum does work . The problem with this sharpener is that the mechanism to vacuum the sharpener to a solid surface does not lock in place . As a result , after a bit of use and over the course of time , the sharpener will no longer be in place and will have to be reset.The vacuum does stick in place for a while . But after the sharpener gets used a bit , it dislodged . If the mechanism locked the vacuum in place , this would not happen.It seems to me that the design is faulty . I ca n't recommend this item .	-1
This notebook is nothing special . If you just need something to write in and that is not sturdy or strong this would work . It is very flimsy and thin feeling . It is not strong at all and just flops over in your hands . The paper is standard paper , possibly thinner . If you need something that will last this is not for you .	-1
With three kids still in school , we tear through these notebooks like mice on cheese . I picked these notebooks up primarily for my youngest daughter who is a writer . She was not best pleased with them . Her issues were:1 . The notebooks are very flimsy so she can not hold them and write she must put them on the desk/table to use them.2 . The pages are not perforated , so she can not remove them without the & # 34 ; bits left behind & # 34 ; mess.3 . The paper itself is not bright white , it has a gray cast to it . ( Note : for some people this may in fact be a positive thing. ) 4 . The cardboard backing is as flimsy as the front cover.On a positive note , the price point is good at the current price ( $ 1.125/notebook ) compared to other online offerings.Not Recommended .	-1
These inexpensive spiral notebooks are okay for general use , but if you 're looking for something durable , you should look elsewhere.I have no complaints about the quality of the paper and do n't have a perforation preference ( these are *not* perforated ) . The problem I have with these is that the backing is so flimsy that the 70-sheet notebook flops about when you hold them . If that does n't bother you , the 4-pack from Amazon is a pretty good value . Personally , I 'd rather spend a few extra bucks and get something more durable .	-1
How can you mess up a simple spiral notebook ? The cover and back . They are so flimsy ! They do n't hold their shape well in a bag and they do n't lend a firm writing surface when you flip over to write.My children also did not appreciate that the 'label ' on front is actually not a label but printed on and therefore can not be removed .	-1
This binder is absolutely huge , and as others have remarked , is nothing like the ones we had in school . The snap closure really makes the whole concept fall flat - it really does have to have the zipper around the whole thing to serve its purpose . As it is now , it 's basically an oversized canvas binder . I also find myself wondering who might be inclined to carry around something this large with the advent of ipads and such , but I suppose there are people out there ... I ca n't use it for what I 'd planned to because of its size so unfortunately it 's sitting in a closet .	-1
The black 1.5 inch MeadTrapper Keeper is sewn on all sides , including the flap that closes with a snap-link device on what would be considered to be the front of the Keeper . Inside there are two storage pockets - one on top of the other on the front over . This three ring binder comes with 5 full sheet vinyl subject dividers . Inside the back cover there is a place to store a pen or pencil . The outside front has a clear plastic sheet that could be used to customize the Keeper . Unfortunately , despite the fact that this item arrived in very good packaging , the plastic was scratch and the opening - where pictures , lettering , etc . could be slipped in - was ragged and missing the edging in places . The opening is positioned so that it would seem when carrying the binder it would be facing downward and items easily could slip out . Finally , the front cover is bowed outward in some places making it awkward to carry . Maybe I received a & # 34 ; used item & # 34 ; to review .	-1
I 'm a child of the 80 's ( guessing most people looking at this probably are ) , so I have fond memories of Trapper Keepers from that bygone era . These new Trapper Keepers are not the same . No `` Trappers '' ( the folders ) are included , the three-ring , `` slide-binder '' mechanism is gone in favor of the same old metal 3-rings you get in every other binder and the design is just kind of plain . I know if may sound odd to talk about the `` coolness '' of a binder , but everything that made the Trapper Keeper a must-have is gone . About the only thing that reminds me of the Trapper Keepers of old is the clear cover where you can insert papers ( or pictures , art , whatever ... it 's basically a transparent pocket ) and the fold-over end , although now it 's fastened with a metal snap closure instead of `` space-age velcro . `` Not everything is bad , just disappointing . The Trapper Keeper ultimately still does the job , although it 's hard to figure out what consumer demographic Mead is aiming at here . It 's an ok binder for school and it will keep your folders and papers in place ( although having to buy Trappers separately is nearly unforgivable ... at least include a couple of them ) . The build-quality seems good enough and the cloth material seems particularly durable.Still , if Mead is aiming at nostalgia , the ho-hum design and lack of features is only going to result in disappointment , while if they 're just aiming this as a binder for school , then I ca n't see why I would n't a product that 's less expensive since there 's no real advantage with the modern Trapper Keeper . If all of this just kind of sounds like Mead is trying to market a poorly redesigned product by cashing in on the nostalgia of today 's parents and the former quality of the brand , then you 've got a pretty good idea of what this new Trapper Keeper is .	-1
Admittedly I was n't a big Trapper Keeper fan when I was a kid , I was one of those nerds carrying a huge zip-up folder because I carried so much stuff . But this folder just feels kind of flimsy , and I 'm not sure why I 'd use it . There 's a plastic cover on the front like a page protector , and about as thin- your kid is going to ruin this on day one shoving it into a backpack or a locker . The inner rings are n't very sturdy either , it 's sort of confusing that the included dividers do n't even have normal holes they 're designed with cutouts that & # 34 ; snap & # 34 ; over the rings . It 's like the designers know their product ca n't stand up to repeated openings and closings ( it ca n't ) so they decided to make inserts that cut down on use.The only reason anyone I know got a Trapper Keeper in school was when they came with cool designs . This new line just seems kind of boring and cheap .	-1
This binder is overpriced . There are more attractive and sturdier binders available on Amazon ( even from Mead ) at lower prices . The binder is covered in two shades of ugly black fabric . It snaps shut . I would prefer an adjustable closure so if the binder is not full you do n't have the flap hanging slack on the side . The clear plastic on the cover which allows you to slide in a picture or title page is made of flimsy plastic that will rip easily . There are 2 inside pockets on the left side . The rings are round . Five plastic dividers are included . I would have preferred D-rings and pockets on the dividers , especially for this price . Trapper Keepers are a great product , but this version falls short in quality and features .	-1
The Mead Trapper Keeper ( item # 72173 ) has one clear exterior pocket . But it is too tight to hold more than a few sheets of paper . Anything less can fall right out of it , especially given its orientation toward the spine and a user & # 8217 ; s naural tendency to hold a binder under their arm with the thick spine downward . This pocket is perhaps best used to hold a label identifying the contents . A simple re-design - reorienting the opening so that it is just barely underneath the flap - would be a welcome improvement . There is enough of a flap beyond the snap to make this possible.The snap closure is difficult to engage . It is also overkill and of little value . Items can still fall out of the two interior fabric pockets if someone were to pick up the binder in the wrong direction . Hole-punched papers are held secure by the ring binder mechanism , so they are unlikely to need the services of the snap to keep them in place.The 5 differently-colored plastic dividers are a nice feature , but not enough to warrant a recommendation to buy this Trapper Keeper in this particular configuration .	-1
I had a green and white Trapper Keeper when I was a kid . It was pretty cool when I was nine , and the folders were awesome because stuff did n't fall out and because they had handy information printed in them . Also there was Velcro which must have just been invented . This is n't the Trapper Keeper from my memory . It 's cheaply made & does n't come with any folders ( the only reason to have one ) . Let your kids pick something they like . It wo n't be this , I guarantee .	-1
This product simply does not work well . It works about 5 percent of the time.I 'm using tagging barbs by the same manufacturer/brand as the tagging gun.There is a learning curve . But I am a mechanical engineer and can figure things out fairly well.The needle mechanism consists of a hollow tube with a side slot and needle that pushes the end of the barb ( the end that is to be poked through the fabric ) through the tube.What happens is the tagging barbs slide out of the side slot of the needle before they are punched through the fabric . It happens over and over again.If you do n't have the fabric flush with the flat front of the tagging gun you have no chance ; if you do , you have a large chance that the barb will split rather than be punched through the fabric.Trying to get this product to work I am reminded of the definition of insanity : Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result .	-1
I like the nylon spine on this binder , which enables the cover to be bent back like a notebook . The divider sections are a sturdy , flexible plastic with pockets , and the covers themselves seemed sturdy , also.However , the first time I carried this a couple blocks ( in my hand , not even crunched in a bookbag ) , I discovered a corner of the back cover had broken off , and a corner of the front cover was cracked . I had n't dropped it or banged it into anything , so I do n't even know how it happened . How do you think it will hold up in a bookbag ? I trimmed the corners smooth as best I could with a scissors , and now I 've relegated this binder to the kitchen for misc . notes , etc . Not impressed .	-1
This has very thin rubber which actually makes my wrist go numb . Now I have my old pad , which was worn out , under it to give it more cush . Maybe buying 2 would be a decent plan .	-1
Not good looking . The frosted window in the front cover does n't lay flat on the inserted printed page , so a lot of it ca n't be read . It is solid flexible plastic with the hinges scored , so It is reluctant to lay open flat , and does n't stay closed well either , and I do n't know how long those hinges will last.They welded the pocket on the inside of the front cover to back up the window which makes it heavier . They included one insert/divider page.with half height pockets on both sides.The rings are round , the latches not too hard to operate.I do n't see why this is worth the cost ... I added an inside pic .	-1
I got it to read QR codes that I normally read from my smartphone . It will only read standard bar codes .	-1
At one year old this unit produces paper jams galore , leaks ink and when we just cleaned it up we removed about two table spoons of jellied ink from within the printer on the right side where the cartridges are parked . The entire unit is smeared with ink on the inside.This is an item in a home office where it is used very lightly.A total waste of time ! There should be a 0 star option for this one .	-1
I was psyched to get these , my friend had an old batch of these and the colors were great . But when it came , the pens LOOK full but they wo n't write . No matter how much I shake them or store them upside down , they just wo n't write . I 'm returning them and spending the money on Sakura Gel Pens instead ! ! Do n't bother with these , although the colors are great when they work , my particular canister did n't write .	-1
Many of the pens quit working within the first few minutes of using them . The glitter may be getting clogged up in some but even the metallic ones are refusing to flow . I could n't get them to write once again no matter how or what I tried . All the old techniques to get the ink to flow with ballpoint pens when I was in school failed . This assortment is proving to be a real `` dud '' . Nearly 25 % of these pens do not work after the first use . I always recap my pens they really should not dry out . I can clearly see the volume of ink is in the inner tube . Frustrating to say the least . Do Not Buy ! Unless you 've got money to blow !	-1
I do n't know why Canon included a gray ink tank . I guess it is to improve the quality of photographs . I am glad I found it on Amazon , because otherwise it is very hard to find . It is not part of the combo packs , I ca n't find it in retail stores , and the Canon store website is a joke - it just does n't work in various important ways . My printer drinks it slowly , but when it goes dry , you ca n't get around needing another one . Get yourself several while you are at it , so you wo n't run out for awhile .	-1
I have always stuck with OEM ink , because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me ( plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-OEM solutions ) .However , it is beyond dumb to see the combos that Canon is offering for the new line of ink jet cartridges . In this case Canon gives you four color cartridges , but all of their current PIXMA printers take five or six - to get the Pigment Black or Gray cartridges you 'll have to buy them separately and at a higher price . Plus this combo includes 50 sheets of paper that not everyone needs ( I have plenty already ) . Perhaps Canon should ditch the paper and lower the list price of this combo by eight dollars - the amount this CLI-226 combo was increased over the CLI-221 combo it replaced.BTW , the other package deal offered by Canon ( PGI-225 BK/ CLI-226 C , M , Y 4 Pack Value Pack ( 4530B008 ) ) is another strange combo that includes Pigment Black and three colors , but does not include Black or Gray.Sorry , but it makes no sense whatsoever to not offer at least a 5-cartridge refill kit for a printers that needs 5 or 6 different inks - except that it lines Canon 's pockets a bit more than it should . A kit that substituted Pigment Black for the paper would make more sense than this - or as I said earlier just get rid of the paper and lower the price significantly.I also have to knock off a star because the new cartridges are opaque , which may have been done to thwart refillers but also prevents users from checking the ink level themselves.Edit July 2011 : When my Pixma MX860 printer recently failed I was looking at upgrading to theCanon PIXMA MG8120 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One Printer ( 4504B002 ) . But in large part due my dissatisfaction with the ink cartridges of the new Pixmas I went with a refurbishedCanon PIXMA MP990 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One Printer ( 3749B002 ) which uses the previous generation CLI-221 cartridges .	-1
Too expensive- buy an off-brand . You will save a lot !	-1
Not meant for my printer although it popped up when I looked for my printers toner . Very deceiving in the search engine .	-1
This is the last ink cartridge I bought for my Canon since I donated it to a charity . I now own a laser printer which gets wonderful value on laser cartridges . I loved my Canon printer but the ink purchases were making me poor !	-1
I have no idea how I did it but it was the wrong cartridge for my printer . So not sure what to do with it . I had to drive 20 miles to our nearest place to buy the correct one ! and 20 miles back , or the machine would n't print . Grhhhh	-1
I have had 3 HP printers and bought Canon based on reviews of the color quality ( which is excellent ) . I do a lot of photography work . All printer manufactures make thier money off of ink cartridges vs. the printer . But these are over the line . Way too expensive . When this printer dies , I 'll go back to HP or another brand , depending on cartridge costs .	-1
We purhcased this for our Canon MG8220 printer . The only reason we went with the branded ink cartridges is because of the product warranty . Once that year is up we 'll probably switch to the refillable tanks . The MG8220 drains ink VERY quickly . So these cartridges do n't last more than a few months of light photo printing and minimal document printing . That being said , these work fine in a Canon MG8220 printer . The colors are crisp and the blacks are deep in photos . So if you 're still under the product warranty buy the Canon branded ink or you 'll void your warranty . If you 're not under warranty , go look for a refillable tank setup.Bottom line : Buy these if your printer is still under the manufacturer 's warranty . Otherwise look for a refillable system .	-1
I have always stuck with OEM ink , because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me ( plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-OEM solutions ) .However , it is beyond dumb to see the combos that Canon is offering for the new line of ink jet cartridges . If you want to save a few dollars by buying a combo pack , you either get this one which does not include the Black or Gray cartridges , or you getCanon CLI-226 BK , C , M , Y with PP-201 50 Sheets Combo Pack ( 4546B007 ) that does n't include the Pigment Black or Gray cartridges , but includes 50 sheets of Canon paper that I do not need ( I already have plenty on hand ) . It make no sense to not offer at least a 5-cartridge refill kit , since all of these Canon inkjet printers require 4 colors plus Pigment Black ( not all utilize Gray ) . The only rationale would seem to be that Canon gets to line its pockets a bit more than it should.I also have to knock off a star because the new cartridges are opaque , which may have been done to thwart refillers but also prevents users from checking the ink level themselves.No wonder so many users go to such lengths to use non-OEM or refill solutions .	-1
This was n't for my machine at all . I am sure it would work fine for the machines that use it , but it should n't pop up under other machines connected links if they are n't meant for that machine .	-1
The AmazonBasics Mouse Pad is , as the name suggests , a basic mouse pad sold via Amazon . This mouse pad is enough to get the job done , but if you 're looks for a mouse pad with a great surface , ergonomic design or comfortable padding , this is NOT it . For a few bucks you get a 9-inch by 8-inch mouse pad that has a bottom made of thin foam rubber and an even thinner surface made of polyester similar to a cheap T-shirt.In my opinion there are two problems with this mouse pad:1 ) It 's too small.2 ) It 's made of cheap materials.I 've honestly received free mouse pads that are better made than this one , and the 9x8 dimensions do n't give you much room to maneuver a mouse if you 're got a high-resolution display and a low-res mouse . I frequently had to pick up my mouse and reposition it on the pad or slide my mouse completely off the pad while testing this pad.Considering that I 've used free mouse pads that were given away at banks or at the time I purchased a PC that were better than this mouse pad I 'm a little amazed that Amazon is selling this mouse pad for as much as they are.Again , if you just need a very basic mouse pad then this does indeed get the job done ... it 's just there are a lot of other mouse pads out there for around the same price that do the job even better than this .	-1
Since I started using this my cursor wo n't work right part of the time which is very annoying . The only thing I can think that is responsible for the malfunctioning cursor is that this thin pad does n't have enough `` grab '' on its surface . This is probably due to the flimsy material from which it is constructed . It is also rather large ( 8x9 '' ) which may be a boon to you but it takes up a lot of space on my little desk . Personally I am going to quit using it and return to using my prior thick mouse pad !	-1
I have bad luck with Epson products . Their longevity sucks . This worked well in the beginning , although it felt like each scan took forever . The software and choosing what and how to use to scan was n't easy to use . I 'm not the top of tech savvy , but i 'm not at the bottom either . It stopped scanning after very few uses ( months later , but total uses was maybe 100 tops ) . I 've tried downloading a driver upgrade ... it just wo n't work . It wo n't load onto my computer . It 's too deep to store easily and too big . I bought it to scan family photos , but it takes too long ( took too long ) and i gave up . It really , for me , was a waste of money . My other Epson printer died after a few months . I truly can not recommend Epson products and wo n't ever purchase them again . Guaranteed .	-1
I do n't normally write such negative reviews , but this was an utter disappointment . I was unable to be productive with this item at all . It took me 10 minutes of disappointment after disappointment trying to cut different types of paper , etc to ultimately decide I needed to return it.The plastic is a sub-par grade , very flimsy.The blade does not cut through paper very smoothly , not one sheet , much less 3 as it claims often not at all . It tore newspaper with the blade , rather than cut it , it caught it and tore it . Not good.I was so disappointed with this purchase that I returned the item for a refund.I did end up purchasing a Swingline SmartCut EasyBlade Plus Rotary Paper Trimmer , 12 Inch , 15 Sheet Capacity ( 8912 ) it was about twice the price , but so much more worth it.Hope that helps you with your purchasing decisionThanks for Reading !	-1
If you need just the occasional paper trimming , this cutter will do the job . This unit is EXTREMELY light weight , the plastic thin and it has nowhere near the sturdiness or heft of other Fiskar paper trimmers ( the rotary styles ) . Also , the swing arm that has measurements on it is difficult to read accurately ; because it is not even with the `` bed '' of the unit , the paper being cut actually 'floats ' about 1/8 inch above the measurement scale , making it harder to accurately read where you are . I attempted to cut an 8 1/2 inch X 11 inch sheet of paper exactly in half ... the shadow cast by the paper and the fact that the paper is not lying directly on top of the scale put the cut off by 1/8 '' -1/16 '' . The cutter itself worked beautifully , giving a crisp , clean edge.I can see what others have reported about the cutter potentially abraiding the guide wire - it sounds like a violin string when I shunt the cutter head back and forth , from the vibrations of the wire ( I have n't used it enough to experience what some have ... the wire breaking completely ) . If you decide to get this unit , I 'd recommend that you be sure to press DOWN on the cutter head , not putting any lateral pressure on it , so it is less likely to rub so hard against the guide wire.Years ago I purchased a full-size Fiskars rotary paper cutter ; it 's substantially heavier than this unit , has a full-sized graph-scored bed and a rotary blade . I find the insert cutting mat portion of the trimmer dulls the blades quickly and needs replacing often . It is , however , amazingly accurate in measuring for cuts . It is also harder to store , more awkward to get out for a few quick paper cuts and does not transport well . This unit being reviewed is compact enough that it could be kept handy in a desk drawer ( a long desk drawer ... you 'll need a little over 15 '' depth ) , but be careful not to store other , heavy items on top of it . The plastic is light enough that too much weight or stress on it could easily break the plastic or the cutter arm . The cutter does a good job cutting through a single or a couple sheets of paper or tag board , but you may need to measure with a separate ruler and mark the cut line.Bottom line : if you have a need for LOTS of paper trimming , get a heavier cutter . If you only occasionally cut a few sheets and would like something small enough to be kept handy plus you appreciate the price difference ( larger rotary models are now running over $ 50 , compared to about $ 17 for this unit ) , then this model may do well enough . 2 1/2 stars .	-1
I make a lot of flyers for our neighborhood and my son 's school . To save paper , I usually make them two per page . It was a pain cutting all of them with scissors so I figured I would get this . It says it cuts 7 pages at once and that sounded pretty good to me . Plus , for the life of me I ca n't cut straight with scissors . There 's no explanation , maybe one of my eyes is slightly off kilter ? So the good : The LED light is a godsend on weak eyes . I thought this was going to be one of those frill features but it turned out to be practical . It shines the cut line on your paper so you know exactly where you 're cutting . The cutter also locks when not in use . I have a three year old and would otherwise be worried he might hurt himself but the lock feature is pretty sturdy.But the bad : It wo n't cut multiple sheets . The most I got was two at a time which was a major disappointment . I tried varying the pressure I put on the rotary tool . I did it lightly , I put my entire weight on it ; I did it fast , I did it slow ; no matter what I did , I could n't get it to cut more than two . TWO ! That does n't help me at all ! I think this would be good for precision work such as cutting photos for scrap booking , but for my needs it did n't help at all .	-1
This product was easy to take out of the box and set up . The paper tray and the lid feel a little loose and junky . It requires additional cables to connect to a computer or network -- either ethernet or a USB cable with a specific end type to plug into the printer.It was advertised as Mac friendly . The software disk that came with it was Windows only . Usually with printers , that 's okay , because you can either use a built in Mac driver or find one online . Well , the Mac PostScript driver did n't work , and Panasonic did n't have a driver on its website . Therefore I have n't been able to test its functions yet.I 'm giving it to my husband to take to his PC-based office , and will update this review further after I see how they like it .	-1

I ordered this desk chair from the Vine program and was looking forward to getting it . From the description , it sounded like the perfect computer desk chair.Unfortunately : *It looks nothing like the picture . The base assembly is plastic , not metal . The arm supports are plastic . Not only does it not match the picture , but the overall effect is cheesy . *The arms are NOT ADJUSTABLE . They 're fixed . THEY DO NOT MOVE . If you look at the picture , you can see that the arm rests are on posts which presumably allow you to raise and lower them . With this chair , the armrests are each one piece of plastic which attaches to the side AND the back of the chair , which does n't allow them to move . *Comfort level ? Okay , not great . I 'm not impressed by the so-called `` lumbar support . '' I have n't owned it long enough to tell if it will be comfortable in the long run . Actually , I may never know . I will probably be using our `` old '' chair and this will be relegated to the basement , as an extra seat . *The chair is supposed to allow a bit of recline . It does n't . You can rock back about an inch -- the same as another chair we recently purchased but which lists way lower than the price of this model . *It 's possible that the wrong item was sent to me , EXCEPT the packing slip clearly identifies this as the product I requested . So : was there a mistake at the warehouse ? Or , was there a flimsier , cheaper prototype that the company is trying to unload so they can market the `` better '' chair ? Or more disturbingly : are higher-quality chairs being swapped out so that someone can profit from selling them while presenting this as the `` real '' chair to unsuspecting customers ? I did alert Vine about this . In any case , the chair I now have is the chair you will possibly receive when you order the product described on this page.This is one of those cases where what you see is NOT what you get . ***** Two other customers ( comments below ) experienced the same thing I did : they recieved the wrong item , not the chair advertised , but one of a much lower quality . I do n't think the `` cheaper '' chair is a bad chair , only that it does not measure up to the model described on this page . IMPORTANT POINT : This is a pattern , not just a one-in-a-thousand ( or however many chairs they have for sale ) problem . ANYONE who orders this chair has a pretty good chance of receiving the WRONG chair . If I had to furnish a home office and wanted the HMH01 model , I would be taking a chance ordering it . If you get the wrong model , it 's a hassle to repackage it and mail it back ( even if amazon reimburses you for the shipping ) . I think they have a problem at the warehouse . **************	-1
**The good features of this chair are that it only took 20 minutes to assemble today and the assembly process was very easy , the directions very clear . Also , the seat height can be adjusted . Unfortunately , that 's about all that I can say that is positive about the chair.The chair that I was sent through Amazon 's Vine Program does not look like this chair at all , so I 'm not sure what your chair will look like if you order it . The chair I received was labeled correctly as `` HON Boda HMH01 '' but is a cheaply-made office chair , definitely not something that retails for almost six hundred dollars . It has a mesh backing that is not adjustable for the lumbar region , nor adjustable for tilt . The arms are hard molded plastic without any cushioning at all and also not adjustable for height nor position ; the left arm rest is already starting to pull apart where the glue is failing . The cushion is poorly made and already wrinkled by the ill-fitting cloth cover.The tilt of the chair is fixed and can not be adjusted ; however , you can loosen a knob below the cushion so that you can rock on the chair . This could not be called a tilt because the position of your back can not change while sitting in the chair -- the angle is fixed at 90 degrees and when you 're rocking the seat rocks right along with the back . In addition , the seat has a slight downward slope to it instead of being parallel with the floor ; I found this very uncomfortable.This chair would honestly work better as a prop chair for a theater set , not something to be used on a daily basis.Not recommended . **	-1
The chair in the picture , and the one described here sounds like a really good chair -- but that 's not what I got . I got a cheap chair that would n't sell for more than $ 100 at an office supply store.What I got , despite the packaging , appears to be more like the HON HVL521 , but even if I were to assume it was really that chair , I still could n't give it a good review . For the price of the HVL521 I would expect better quality than what I got.The cheap chair that I got has a fabric covered foam seat with a cover that does n't fit the seat . It 's puckered-up near the rear . The pneumatic lift is anemic . It might be fine if you 're 100lb , but as a 240lb ( okay , 260lb ) man , I do n't see it lasting for more than a couple months of use.The cheap casters pop into a soft plastic base . You 'd better have a hardwood floor because if they sink into even a short-piled carpet , the sideways stress put on them is going to cause them to come loose , and drop out quite easily.So if the chair I got is the correct chair that you 'll get , there is no way it 's worth anything close to the price I paid . If it 's the other model that it appears to be , it 's still poorly made .	-1
I was thrilled with this purchase since the ink was so much cheaper than the regular ink . However , my printer has stopped printing black normally . When I do the printer test it says the heads need to be cleaned and after doing many cleaning cycles and replacing the black cartidge with a brand name Epson cartidge , I still ca n't get the black print head to work again . I have used a similar product on a brother printer for a year with no problem so maybe it is the printer . However , the Epson disclaimer says non-epson inks may damage the printer , so I am inclined to think the are right in this case .	-1
WHAT WAS I THINKING ? ? ? ? Trying to save a few bucks and now I am stuck with a printer that wo n't print and an hour drive to town to buy a new printer.First I had trouble installing the cartridges . The seller was VERY nice and answered my questions fast ( thumbs up to the seller ) . I got them all installed . Oddly ( blast you Epson ) , after I installed one they all seemed to need changing even though they showed having plenty of ink ... hmmm . Finally I got them installed and printed five pages that looked decent ( not great ) . Then from one page to the next the colors were off . For the first time in the 2-3 years I have had the printer I had to clean the heads and all that utility type stuff and NO LUCK . Nothing I have done will get the printer printing again . I am just out of luck.Anyway , now I have NO WORKING PRINTER and am not only out what I spent on these AWFUL cartridges , but I guess I will just have to buy an entire new printer . GEESH ... WHAT WAS I THINKING ? ? ? ? I will beg you to not buy ANY off brand ink jet cartridges . Just stick with the name brand ones . I am weeping on my ink stained fingers.UPDATE ! ! ! I literally threw the printer away and had to purchase an ENTIRE NEW PRINTER ! I spent hours cleaning the heads and doing everything imaginable and then the printer told me the cartridges were not compatible and refused to even clean the heads . This was a very costly , time consuming and frustrating mistake . I swear I will never , ever be tempted to buy off brand cartridges again ... yep , I should have known better .	-1
These cartridges did n't work , period . They slot into my Epson Workforce 600 just fine , but no ink comes out . Taking them out I can see punctures in the feed holes , so it 's not that . I 'll definitely be seeking another solution for economical ink . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Another cheap , crappy piece of plastic made in China : I returned this very quickly to Amazon . Shavings were constantly spewing out the sides of the thing while it was in operation and it is very noisy with a lot of vibration while it 's sharpening . I upgraded to an iPoint sharpener which is super quiet , smooth and quick : ten zillion times better than this one.NOT RECOMMENDED ! ! !	-1
I HAD THIS SHARPENER SINCE MARCH AFTER ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS IN AMAZON , ONLY FOR IT TO STOP WORKING AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS . IT WAS PURCHASED FROM WHITE STAR . WHEN I CALLED THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURERSCHOOL SMART -- THEY SAID THAT THIS COMPANY WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO SELL THIS PRODUCT TO BEGIN WITH , AND URGED ME TO CONTACT THE COMPANY -- NO RESPONSE ! LUCKILY I PURCHASED FROM AMAZON AND THEY RETURNED IT PROMPTLY AND ISSUED ME A REFUND . I AM SURPRISED THAT IT JUST STOPPED WORKING -- AND DONT UNDERSTAND ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS ... NUMBER ONE ? ? NOT AT ALL -- SO YOUR RESEARCH !	-1
I 'm not a huge fan of these types of show generated spin-off items . The quality is poor - the magnetism is weak and the dry erase is difficult to erase after a day ( even with dry erase cleaner and an eraser . ) If you are really , truly committed to losing weight , this may be a good crutch for a week . Eventually , you 'll want something with more depth that you will create yourself . I would have added a star IF the manufacturer had included a booklet that estimates calorie counts for common foods .	-1
. . . that could n't be acquired elsewhere ( say , at an office supply store ! ) This magnetic dry erase white board is designed to fit on the refrigerator door so that one can track one 's food and caloric consumption throughout the day . Unfortunately , it seems to be little more than an advertisement for both `` Expo '' and `` The Biggest Loser '' . Except for the recommended caloric intake based on weight ( 7 calories per pound ! ? ! Exactly ! ) nothing is unique , unususal , or special . Further , if one wants to track progress over several days -- guess what ? One has to purchase another product ! Again , shameless marketing for `` The Biggest Loser '' combined with an almost total lack of originality makes this product less than impressive.Not recommended .	-1
When I ordered this white board , I thought it would be a tool to help me plan my meals for a week or so and would help me stay on track as I diet from now to eternity . Instead , I got white board that is part confessional/part harassment tool for brothers and the like . In order for this to work as planned , I believe that I am supposed to write down what I plan to eat , total calories , glasses of water , and my _actual weight_.That last part is a real problem for anyone who has kept their weight secret since well , birth . I know that the folks on the television show give their actual weight ( shudder ) to the world , but as for me , no way . So , I can write down everything except my weight , except for one thing : my family members all have calculators and have no problem dividing my calorie count by 7 to get my optimum weight . ( which is what I 've been saying I already weigh for the past 20 years ) .My other problem is the size and suggested location for this food confessional : The board is 11 '' x 14 '' , and has magnets on the back , which suggests a refrigerator location . The first makes it easy for anyone to read without glasses , and the fridge location is just cruel . I do n't need to be reminded of my chunkitude every time I go to get a diet soda , glass of water or pint of ice cream.If giving your weight does n't bother you , you probably do n't need to be on a diet , anyway .	-1
This is basically a marketing tool for the Biggest Loser and I did n't find it helpful at all . You can only plan one day 's meals with it , and much space on the board is wasted with logos . I used it more for keeping track of what I ate than for planning . I also got the exercise planner -- of the two , I think the meal planner is a better product , although I 'm unimpressed with both of them and my reviews are very similar . Magnetized strips allowed me to put the meal planner on the fridge , and this one is n't quite so outrageously priced.I was unimpressed with the eraseability of the board . Much ink was smeared and left behind when I went to erase it . I would up having to use a bit of soap and water to get it clean . Not exactly dry-erase ! The board does n't come with any information on effectively using it -- I would 've thought a short brochure on meal planning would 've been nice .	-1
First , I love most Sharpie products , including their new non-permanent pens . So I thought I 'd give these a try.As has been well-documented here by others , the writing does not look like a pencil , it looks like a grey pen that skips a lot . There is no boldness to the line , and it makes reading what you wrote an eyesore.Truly a disappointment , and a surprisingly poor product .	-1
Many companies have a dud product , but for Sharpie to have released this to the public , SHAME on them . I purchased this product due to brand name and excitement about pencil leads being liquid . Well I do n't know whose pockets got lined to passthis item through failed experiments , but I see a refund in my future so it wo n't be my money.The product simply does n't work . Writing is sketchy at best . Sharpe needs to go back to the drawing board- something apparently not done when testing this product , but selling this to the public in such a condition is unacceptable .	-1
Sharpie advertises this product as being `` smooth like a pen , erases like a pencil '' . It a very poor pen that writes less smoothly than this product , and the texture is n't really pencil-like . The erasing goes fine , but the erasers on the end of the pencil fall off very easily . Waste of $ 6 .	-1
These are awful pencils , they skip , they are barely `` erasable '' , so frustrating to use that I threw mine away . What a waste of money . Buy some cheap Bic mechanical pencils instead , you 'll be better off .	-1
I always associate Sharpie with quality products . Who has n't used one of their markers ? They are the gold standard for fiber tipped markers . For that reason , when I saw this liquid pencil on the shelf , I grabbed a pack to check them out.I noticed the pencil had a nice rubber grip ( love rubber gripped pens ) and it had a good mechanical `` click '' to extend the point . And that 's where it stopped . The thing writes poorly . It skips when you write - a lot ! Completely unacceptable . And I tried it on all types of paper too , not just the Sunday Times Crossword puzzle ( slick paper - would n't even make a mark on it ! ) . White paper , post-it note , even my Moleskine planner - USELESS ! Complete and utter waste of money.Do not buy this - unless , of course you like wasting your money on things that do n't work.A shock from the Sharpie guys and a real disappointment._______________________________________________________________________________________Update - Sharpie is standing behind their product and if I send it back , they will refund my money ...	-1
I too had high hopes for this pencil . Considering Sharpie is a reputable brand that makes quality markers , it was a huge disappointment to find that this pencil does indeed write like a bad pen , as others have stated . When you first begin to write , you get that lull/skip of ink , or in this case , liquid lead ( ? ) . I thought I could live with that , considering I just love when a Bic clear stick does that , but for work where I have to fill out a job log sheet , its a huge fail .	-1
This has the potential to be a great product . The problem is that it does n't write when it is tilted at the normal angle at which I hold a pen or pencil . I have to tilt it more upright to what is an unnatural position for me or none of the ink flows . This flaw turns what has the potential to be a breakthrough product into a mediocre one at best . I have attached a customer image showing the difference when writing at these different angles.UPDATE : after further attempts to use this I 've downgraded my rating to 2 stars . This product is simply not ready for prime time . I 'm really surprised that the folks at Sharpie put their good name on this . The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that there may be some people who normally hold their hand at the awkward angle required for this pencil to work well . When it is held at that angle the product itself does what it says .	-1
I love Sharpie products , but this is the first one that really disappointed me . The pencil is ergonimically designed and looks very chic , but the graphite ink delivery is very inconsistent ; lines of written out will be solid or choppy depending on how the ballpoint can deliverthe ink . I have tested the pencil on different types of paper and it works the best on the yellow business pad . It does not write well on glossy paper like all liquid gel inks and will smear . Erasability will depend on how much force is exerted when you write , if you write lightly , then it erases cleanly , but if you writing leaves impressions on the paper then residue is left on the paper and you can not fully erase the ink . You can use any type of eraser to erase the liquid ink which one of the good characteristics of this pencil . If you want improvement do not hesitate to contact Sharpie , it 's a company that seems to emphasize improvement , which is why the retractable sharpie writing instruments have improved , they do not dry our as fast as the initially pens . I look forward the the next redesign of this new pencil , but currently the pencil just does not measure up to the original lead or barrel based pencils .	-1
When I think Sharpie , I think BOLD . I think clean solid bold lines . When I saw this product I was really excited , saw that it was back ordered I was even more excited , received it and was immediately disappointed.The functionality of writing pencil that becomes permanent after a few days was not of interest to me ... but a pencil that did n't have breaking led or the need to advance lead ? That sounded great ! So here is the lowdown : It does n't write as cleanly or consistently as erasable pens . It does n't write as cleanly as a pencil . It sort of writes like a cheaper than the cheapest Bic pen you 've ever tried.I am not happy with this pencil at all , and will never buy them again unless they say that they 've made changes . I 'd just basically consider this an erasable pen , and at the bottom of the heap of performance , at that .	-1
I got these with great expectations , I love everything sharpie and this was the biggest let down of my life . They write horribly , like a pen that 's running out of ink , they skip they tug they are just uncomfortable no pressure a lot of pressure hot or cold little use or a lot of use there is just no helping these liquid pencils , the only thing that is great about them is they erase easy so you can erase the mess and start over with a real pencil or pen ... stick to the sharpie pens ! ! !	-1
My experience with the product has been pretty much the same as the majority of reviewers . It skips a lot , often requiring a long time to get going . Then it skips intermittently.I did like that it came with some extra erasers and that the plastic type of eraser works very well with this.The skipping unfortunately is a deal breaker .	-1
I own a lot of Sharpie products and love them so when I saw that Sharpie now has a range of liquid mechanical pencils , I was keen to try them out . They look very nice and stylish , and when I tried writing with one , I liked the smooth ink which feels like writing with a ballpoint pen except that the ink is erasable with a pencil eraser.Unfortunately , the ink flow is inconsistent and these pencils proved to be a terrible disappointment . I ca n't believe Sharpie is marketing these pencils with such an obvious flaw . I tried the other pencil in the pack and had the same disappointing results . It was frustrating to write with when I had to go back over the lines the pencil missed . If Sharpie can fix this flaw , these pencils would be winners because the other features - smooth eraser , stylish barrel , and the smoothness of the lines when the pencil actually works , are great .	-1
Smooth and flowing ... shucks , these pen-pencils do n't do that . The ink does not come out smoothly and when it does it is very light . Since it 's already light it 's easy to erase.Do n't buy these . They obviously did n't go through product testing .	-1
I bought these because the idea seemed cool but I returned them ( something I almost never do ) immediately . They skip like an out of ink ball pen . Completely useless . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Having used Sharpie pens and markers for decades , I expected that I was going to LOVE these liquid pencils . Here 's what I like about them : they erase nicely . Other than that , they are nearly useless . They leave blobs of `` ink , '' they skip , they require more pressure than an ordinary pencil , they are not useful when a fine hand is involved ( or small characters ) , and they have all the disadvantages of the cheapest ball point pens.A number of years ago , a manufacturer produced the same type of product and it was unsatisfactory . Sharpie seems to have taken a step or two backward from that point . The design of the Sharpie pencil is nice and it would be comfortable to write with if extra pressure was not required . Otherwise ... it 's back to the drawing board .	-1
I was hoping for a board that I could list my exercise schedule each week . When I got the product I was disappointed as there is little room to write down any meaningful schedule . 50 % of the board space is filled with over-sized advertising for the biggest loser . While I like the program I do n't think they should have dominated the space . Too bad .	-1
This is an awfully big , big board , and it 's laid out in such a way that you can only keep track of one week 's exercise at a time . It comes with an Expo dry erase pen , but mine was cracked and broken upon arrival , so I had to throw it away.The reason I 'm unimpressed is pretty simple : This board retails for almost $ 30 . Amazon sells it for about $ 20 . But if you ordered a plain white board and some dry erase markers yourself , you could have your own exercise tracker for about 10 or 12 dollars . So you 're paying a premium for The Biggest Loser brand name , and they decide for you what your board will look like and what it will keep track of for you.Personally , I 'd rather save myself the few extra bucks and spend them on donuts .	-1
For $ 12 you can get a comparable dry erase board at Staples . This one has a rudimentary weekly calendar on it , as well as a thermometer for tracking goal achievement . Other than a marker , that 's it . No written information about goal setting , types of exercises , tracking improvement , etc . NOTHING except a corporate logo.Sure , regular visual reminders are useful . That being said , there are better apps for $ 0.99 at the Apple store , and these will track weekly , monthly and annual goals along with progress against them . This product is simply an opportunistic exercise in unnecessary branding.I would have rated it one star but it is sturdy and , in conjunction with a more full-featured program , may serve an occasional purpose .	-1
Do n't get me wrong ; it is what it is , if you 're a fan of the show , and really think something like this will help keep you organized and motivated , then go ahead . But it 's hard to see how this is any more effective than a regular plain dry-erase board that could more easily be used for more than just exercise tracking . And the mounting screws/brackets/whatever are not exactly convenient or user friendly , and the size of the thing makes me wonder where one would put this . This product is not for me !	-1
Would review this product , but , it arrived with the pen shattered and dried out completely . So now I have to buy my own pen .	-1
This is basically a marketing tool for the Biggest Loser and I did n't find it helpful at all . It 's very large for what it does . The important part -- the workout planning -- takes up maybe 2/3 of the available space . The remainder of the space is wasted with the show and manufacture 's logos . There 's a goal tracker which I suppose some may find useful , but again , I thought it was space better served by providing more room to write your exercise plan . Maybe I write big , but I did n't really have room to write in the boxes.I was unimpressed with the eraseability of the board , too . Much ink was smeared and left behind when I went to erase it at the end of the week . I would up having to use a bit of soap and water to get it clean . Not exactly dry-erase ! The board does n't come with any information on effectively using it , which for the cost , I would 've thought a short brochure on workout planning explaining how often to do each type ( the board has columns for static cardio , interval cardio , and circuit training ) or giving sample workout plans would 've been nice .	-1
Was great when it worked . But lately the print heads started clogging regularly , and cleaning them has stopped working ( which is all they could recommend on tech support ) . Now it just prints blank sheets of paper . Sadly after just over a year , I have to buy another printer .	-1
This printer has been a great assist to me since my purchase , sometimes it does n't work but I can always play around and fix it . Not this time.I consistently get the U052 error and I could not fix it . It says I 'm using the wrong cartridge but I tried all my OEM , nonOEM cartridges it would not fix it . I even tried to reset the whole machine , worked for a few pages and then popping U052 again.Canon , I 'm tired trying to play around with you and I 'm going to try another brand.I would not recommend this printer to anyone , because it is a disaster ( especially when school begins and you have everything to print ) .Run and stay away .	-1
The printer is completely digital and very , very slow . Could not scan into the PC and could not do'draft ' printing to save ink . The ink cartridges are very small , fraction of an oz and get used up fast . By letting Canon have access to printer they learned enough to set the machine so it would no longer recognize a competitor 's ink cartridge which worked fine and was considerably less costly -- Global Sophia which is a duplicate of Canon 's cartridge except for the digital signature . They didadd another program after 6 months , Navagator , which may permit scanning into the PC , but did not tryit yet since I found another way of getting the work done . Initially I thought it was a good valuethrough Amazon but now know it is not . Dell had a good little work horse but they got access digitallyand also changed things to their advantage , stopped the draft printing , and can not buy ink cartridge easily in the market place . They want you to buy from them only at full price .	-1
Do n't do it . I loved this PIXMA , and its price , right up until it mysteriously stopped working . It suddenly began insisting at all times that there was a foreign device in its ( empty ) USB slot that I needed to remove . This was initially just strange , given I kept the printer and my workspace very clean , and could be cured by sticking a USB stick in the port that it did recognize . But not longer after I discovered this solution , it just stopped working altogether , claiming a totally different error ( that also was n't applicable ! ) . I spent hours and hours and hours trying various Canon solutions without any luck . The end cost : more than $ 100+ on this printer then 10-20 hours cleaning the printer and trying to problem solve .	-1
I googled what it could mean , and it means that the ink is either not recognised , or not loaded correctly . I read the manual on how to install it correctly . No dice . Keeps doing the same dumb error.No USB cable included in the box , so I had to go out and buy one.Frankly , I do n't have the time or the patience for this . I 'd sooner return and buy a new one than finagle this garbage.This error message means that I can not scan , print , or do anything else with the machine . In other words , I have a big fat brick . I tried to get the contact info for Cannon customer support , and the page wo n't load . Classy . The singapore page loads , right there with the phone number . So if I wanted to make a long distance call to Singapore , I 'd be golden . But the USA support site ? Not so much .	-1
I have owned expensive and inexpensive printers and none of them have lasted more than 1.5 years . My current printer was a Lexmark but they finally got tired of providing me replacement printers for ones that stopped working before the 1 year warranty ran out . I read glowing reviews of Canon printers and thought this one looked attractive at my budget of under $ 75.This PIXMA MP280 printer was very easy to set up and use without having to read the instruction manual . I like that . A lot . No cd installation needed as everything is automatically done online . Plenty of Canon software was available for use with this printer . The cartridges that came with the printer must have been sample ones because they lasted about 30-40 printed pages but the price of replacement cartridges were reasonable and they lasted a long time . I had no issues until the automatic paper feeder started to act up . From that point on , the paper frequently started to get stuck and forced me to manually feed the paper into the machine . So not fun . Soon after , I kept getting paper jam messages for no reason . There was no help from Canon since the warranty was up , although they did suggest shaking the printer . Nothing worked.For the three months this printer worked , it did a great job . The color images and text printing were great . The scanning and copy features also worked well . I had no complaints until the automatic paper feeder stopped working all the time and then a `` paper jam '' error message would not disappear despite the lack of an actual paper jam . I know the saying , `` you get what you pay for '' but I feel that a $ 60 printer should work for at least a year . My Lexmark printer cost just under $ 30 and had a 1 year warranty while this one cost $ 60 and had a 90 day warranty . It 's time to look for another printer and after doing the math , I have my doubts about another Canon . Margaux Paschke , 29 September 2011	-1
Worked good for just over a year , very little use , now after 16 months of use it is dead.Used to be Canon made a decent scanner , those days are now gone .	-1
This may be the most defective device I 've ever purchased . None of the buttons on the scanner itself for '1 click action ' work . No graphic programs see the scanner , though it is clearly installed properly . If I scan from the included software , all attempted scans come out solid black . Back this goes to Amazon . I 'd avoid buying this .	-1
it stopped . The ink got dry in the lines and black stopped working . Never had this issues with any HP machine I owned . Will not deal with Brother again .	-1
I can put this on literally any surface , from paper to metal , and it will not stick . I can pull the tape off , leaving no residue at all . Maybe I just got one of those rolls in a thousdand or maybe they have no quality control . Complete waste of money .	-1
The tape itself is fine but the dispenser is very hard to work with , and there 's no option not to use it . Tape with no dispenser ( together with a pair of scissors ) is far preferable .	-1

I 've had this brand , and one other brand of Mag-lock , and both failed miserably . Why ? Undercoating on vehicles is sprayed at the manufacturer , and prevents solid magnet-to-metal contact . Even if this seems like it grips tight on your refrigerator , for instance , this is not the same as the underside of your car/truck.The car will get wet , and muddy and soiled , and not only does that further reduce the bond when the magnet gets filmy and the metal gets oxidized on your car , but it will ruin the computer chip key ( most modern vehicle keys have a computer chip ) as this mag-key holder is not watertight . This can somewhat be allayed by wrapping the key in tin foil , which is recommended and does not disable the chip.You will , during a lock-out , climb under your vehicle ( or under the fender , or wheel well , etc . ) , and not find this box . And with computer chip keys about $ 50 , you will pull your hair out when you trusted your key to a $ 2 box.One solution is the hide hitch combination lock , if you have a vehicle with a trailer hitch ; I have one on my Chevy truck and it 's superb . People can watch you put the key in ( plus spare cash , whatever ) , and they still ca n't get it out . Only you have the combination.HitchSafe Key VaultHitchSafe Key VaultTo hide a key on a car , there are plenty of options , but best remains wrapped in tin foil ( ziplock baggies do not last ) , and wired with stiff wire ( the cheap coat hangers from the cleaners work well , the cheaper the better , more flexible ) through the key itself and then to a high piece of metal ( not the frame close to the ground , but get under there near the firewall of your vehicle and find metal you must reach up for ) , where you wrap and wrap that wire around the metal 4-5 times . It 'll be there when you look for it four years later when your purse gets stolen from the restaurant with your car keys in it .	-1
I chose this keycase as a container for my spare care key . With the magnet it supposedly would adhere to iron or steel on the underside of the car . Unfortunately the magnet was not up to the job ( it barely held ) , and I had to return the keycase .	-1
HP 564 Inkjet Cartridges , Set of 4 ( Black , Cyan , Magenta & Yellow ) were not new , where recharged , HP printers do not work with recharged ink which is wrong . How can they do this , I thought there was a law against this . But this work help regular people so the government would never do something to help us .	-1
This product is such rubbish that I can not believe that anyone would order it . The resulting words look like dried up squiggles that I can barely read .	-1
This is by far the most attractive printer I 've seen . The flat black finish and collapsible output paper holders were nice touches . The cables run in the back and are nicely hidden . I ended up putting it with my entertainment electronics and it fit right in.Of course , the looks of a printer are pretty meaningless if it does n't perform well . I 've been using it for about a month now and have had very little to complain about . The copier works fine for me , and regular printing is effortless . Two-sided printing is a breeze.Although the printer is loaded with features , I have only used a few . Here is what I like ( that I 've used ) : * Paper tray holds a lot more paper than my previous printers . It also has an open panel in the front so you can tell how much paper is in the feeder . * Control panel has a tilt feature . * Installation was a snap . * Print speed is impressive . * Excellent photo printing.There are n't many I 've found , but here are a few things I do n't like : * Noisy . Even in quiet mode it is loud . Compared to a Brother all-in-one I have , it is much louder . Compared to a Canon Pixma , it is about the same . * Out of paper message . When you are out of paper the screen says you are either out of paper or have a paper jam . I wish it were smart enough to know the difference . * Shake it ! I have this guy sitting on a cheap end table with plastic legs . This wo n't last too long . When I print it shakes the table like a belly dancer . Make sure you have a good solid non-slip surface to put it on.I like this printer . It been reliable and does all I 've wanted it too . ** Update **Today , the printer decided it was done . It refuses to power up . Not sure what happened , it worked the previous night and when i come home today it is a goner .	-1
Likes:1 . Regular cord - no giant floor wart getting tangled with other cords.2 . Comes with FULL ink cartridges , not those scammy half-full OEM 's many other brands still use.3 . Small footprint - it 's about the size you expect a printer to be , not a massive contraption that needs its own desk.4 . Intuitive setup with step-by-step instructions . I 'm pretty sure a non-techie could install this printer if they followed the steps.5 . Ability to download individual drivers online instead of being forced to install a massive package of garbage demo software.6 . A `` quiet mode '' allows you to trade speed for slightly reduced noise when printing.7 . Photograph printing is quick , easy and accurate.8 . Puts itself in reduces power mode during periods of inactivity.Dislikes:1 . No USB cable included - c'mon printer makers ! It 's time to start selling a complete product.2 . Update issues - in spite of installing the latest drivers , I am repeatedly prompted to install the same scanner driver again.3 . Online driver downloads are slow ( 100 kbps max ) .4 . At least three new files are loaded during startup . While startups are not nearly as slow as my old , bloated HP drivers , I would love to see the day when a printer simply and quickly loads a single driver.5 . Ordering new ink is a pain . This model takes `` 127 '' ink but we ca n't search for this or `` Epson 127 '' . Instead we need to remember a specific seven-digit item code every time we want to order new ink.6 . Print tray is difficult to insert and remove , never quite sure it was inserted correctly because it fights its way into the printer.7 . Print quality ( plain paper ) is just okay and printing from the web is a chore.My biggest problem with this printer is that it does not print web pages accurately . Sometimes printing is accurate , but many times you will end up with wasted paper and ink due to inaccurate formatting . It is a bad enough issue that I am forced to use print-preview by default ; also a problem because their previews are grainy and unclear . When I asked tech support about this issue , the response I received was , `` ... we do n't guarantee you can print off the Internet . '' I find this answer unacceptable considering much of our business and personal activity has moved online.In comparison to my old printer , aHP Officejet Pro 8500 , I found the print quality of the Epson on plain paper to be lacking . While perfectly acceptable from a distance , close examination of plain-paper printing showed signs of streaking as one character of text blurred slightly toward the next . I also found high-resolution graphics to be rather lacking as you could see the individual droplets instead of a solid , continuous line . This reminds me of printers of old and HP does a much better job than Epson in this respect.Photo printing , on the other hand , is quite good with accurate color representation and edge-to-edge borderless printing . The drivers make it quick and easy ; just right-click your digital photo and select `` Print '' . From there a screen pops up with an accurate representation of what your photo will look like when printed . Every setting such as type of photo paper , print size , print quality , and so on is clearly marked and easily adjusted via a drop-down menu . There 's no `` shrink-to-fit '' but there is a `` fit-to-paper '' mode that will cut off the edges of an image if necessary to fit to borderless photo paper.If you 're buying printers primarily to print photos then you may be happy with this printer 's ease of use . It 's too bad their plain paper quality is acceptable at best . If they 'd send their software developers back into the cave until they returned with a good WYSIWYG web printer driver I 'd be more inclined to recommend this . Until then , three stars.Edit 12/2011 : Finally ended up breaking it trying to get the paper tray reloaded . Words can not describe how much I hated loading paper into this thing . Have you seen the movie `` Office Space '' ? It was so bad I never printed photos just because I 'd have to go through the hassle of putting regular paper back in the tray . In addition , I discovered the driver updater installed on my Win 7 x64 system never worked correctly . A quick check to the Epson site reveals this model printer had numerous updates including a firmware update , yet the silly Epson driver updater kept trying to install the same scanner driver to this day . Dropped my rating to two stars .	-1
I give it two stars because it works great if you do n't need to connect to it ( scan to print is great ! ) .Do n't bother trying to connect it to a Mac . The utilities are primative at best.Wireless scan on PC is not consistent.Getting consistent print is tough . ( Get stripes through images in many cases ) I am so troubled by my experience because past Epson experiences simply have n't been this bad .	-1
My laptop is just a couple years old , but I have maxed out the hardware . My son loves to play games that keep the laptop going all the time , so it 's has started to have thermal shutdowns . I decided to either ( 1 ) replace the internal fan , or ( 2 ) get a cooling pad . I saw this one and it claims to keep the laptop cool.This thing does absolutely NOTHING to keep the laptop cool ! It looks like it might do the trick because it has a curve and a sink at the back . In reality , it made no difference , and the laptop still gets just as hot just as fast.I was going to leave it one star and return it , but my wife likes to use it just as a lap desk . It works OK for this purpose , but why would they lie and make it seem like it also cools ?	-1
opened immediately after delivery so it did NOT stand/store , leaked once all over and quit working altogether.I NEVER GOT TO USE IT AS IT NEVER WORKED.WORTHLESS WASTE OF MONEYTry the fiskar brand white gel pen -- it works great . Except I can not find one sold seperately -- only as a pen set . But they are INexpensive and work GREAT .	-1
I 've had the mat for a couple of weeks and I 'm very impressed . I see no indication the mat will dimple where the chair rollers rest on the mat . It has a very solid surface . The cheap mats from Staples only last about a year and then start to crack . The only complaint is that every two days I have to adjust its position because it shifts away from the desk ( about an inch per day ) .UPDATE : I got fed up with the mat shifting every day so I put two eye screws in my desk ( on either side of the footwell ) and drilled two holes in the front of the mat and secured the mat with zip ties . Seems to work pretty good , but the product should have been made to prevent shifting.UPDATE 2 : After 1.5 years it is starting to crack in several places . Downgraded from 4 stars to 2 stars . Maybe 1.5 years is n't bad compared to others , but for the price it should last forever .	-1
did not last too long before cracking . maybe about 6 months . old one from staples lasted two years . will go there again to buy .	-1
As I said , it JUST looks better than plywood . This mat is the cheapest thing that I have ever seen , and I am not talking about the price . The mat came rolled up in a box that was about 10 inches square , so naturally I had to lay the mat out in the sun for about 6 hours to get the kinks out of it so it would lay flat.. Then when I sat in my desk chair the casters immediately sunk into the mat , and I could barely roll the chair around on the mat because it made ruts where ever I would roll it . The second day that I had it I submitted a request to return this junk . I will buy something better now .	-1
I ordered two of these mats , and both of them came rolled up in an individual box , rather than being shipped flat between two pieces of cardboard as was the case with a previous mat I 'd ordered . I ended up having to leave the mats out on the driveway in the sun for the better part of a day to get them flat , even though the instructions indicated that laying them out in a heated room would work ( I tried that first , after 3 days they were still not flat ) .My other issue is that they seem rather thin , it is only slightly easier to roll my chair around on the mat than it was on bare carpet . I think if they were a bit more rigid this issue would go away . The mat also seems to move around more than I would expect -- I have to re-position it every day . They do protect the carpet , so I do n't hate them completely but still was rather disappointed .	-1
Bought this for a very low pile home office carpet . As others have said , the chair wheels sink in , causing permanent depressions , The mat does not stay in place , but slides back and forth and sideways . If a wheel rolls off the edge trying to roll it back on the mat does not work - the mat edge turns up trapping the chair .	-1
This was a replacement for an cracked mat of identical dimensions for my home . It laid flat quickly , however it does NOT hold well in standard apartment carpet . At least 6 times a day I must move it back to where it belongs . Spend a little more and get one that has deeper nubs because this was a total waste of money . Did not have that plastic odor . NOT recommended .	-1
This mat is thin , but seems OK and like it will work fine for the intended purpose , but like many others have reported here , mine has an unpleasant odor . I tried washing it off , did not help . So I have it in another room and hoping the odor will go away in a reasonable time . Too bad , because it would be a great product at this price otherwise . I tried using it despite the odor , but it was too unpleasant.2012-01-25 Update : Odor has subsided somewhat , though still present . I am using the mat now . This size is a bit too small for me . It 's OK as far as chair forward/backward area , but not much room on the sides ( only 4 inches or so on either side for my typical office chair , so I roll off the mat on the sides fairly frequently . Usable , but I would order a larger size next time.2012-02-01 Update : Had to stop using again as the odor still there and builds up in enclosed ( small room ) space . Not a strong odor , but unpleasant to me . So trying again to air it out some more ... 2012-02-17 -Dropped my rating to 2 stars . Odor persists and ruins this otherwise acceptable mat for me .	-1
I read the reviews and wish that I could enjoy the many 4 and 5 stars this printer receives . Out of the box it has not worked properly . Try to align the print cartridges and it fails each time . Customer service is no help - probably needs a new printer head . Out of the box a lemon and my mistake ... did n't buy from Amazon . I buy 99 % of my stuff from Amazon and this is why . Products are easy to return . I bought this printer on a whim from Staples . They get a 1/2 star . Bad service and because I did n't have all items with the box packaging they would not me return until I spent time with the manager . What a hassle.I recommend to buy a different printer and buy it from Amazon .	-1
My home is totally wireless , laptops , DVD player , thermostats , web cams , TV 's , all connected to the internet using a/b/n compatible latest NetGear Wireless router . All work well but this printer has design defects in their wireless firmware and/or hardware . Connects when it wants to , says there is a weak signal when only 10 feet away . Got it working a couple of times but moment shut off did not connect consistently . Finally gave up and connected it directly via Ethernet . Once I did that no complaints works and prints great . I suggest if you want Wifi compatibility walk from this one but from a printing , scanning copying perspective , works well . No excuse for Wifi problems . If Wifi worked I 'd give it 4 stars .	-1
I had an Epson a long time ago and was n't very thrilled with it , but this model is great . It was very easy to set up , both on wifi for my laptop and wired for the desktop PC next to it . I was surprised at how fast it prints , even on wifi . The interface on the printer is very easy to use and easy to read . I 've never had a scanner before , but was able to jump right into scanning photos and sending them to the desktop , or via wifi to the laptop.The ink cartridges that come with the printer are robust as well . My husband 's an accountant who does a ton of printing during tax season , and many 's the time I 've made an emergency run to Target or Walmart for a printer cartridge . Not this year , though ! We have yet to replace a cartridge , and they 're very reasonably priced ( I hate getting `` soaked '' on ink ) .The printer is large and the lid is a little flimsy , but those are only minor complaints . Well done , Epson - you 've redeemed yourself for me.===UPDATE , ONE YEAR LATER : After a year of frequent use , for my husband 's accounting and kids ' school projects , this printer bit the dust . It said the black ink was low , I replaced it , it said the pink ink was low , I replaced it , then no matter how many times I turned it off and back on , it would only make mechanical noises followed by a message `` Printer error ; turn off and on . '' I spoke to a CS rep who gave me the bad news : it would have to be repaired at an Epson repair shop , and he candidly said that buying a new Epson would be cheaper than getting this one fixed . He then emailed me a special `` loyal customer '' code that entitled me to buy refurbished printers from Epson for about the same price as new ones from Amazon . As if . I dusted off our old HP Photosmart , which I had n't gotten rid of thank goodness , and it works just fine after resting up for a year .	-1
The NX625 is an inexpensive printer using cyan , magenta , yellow and black ink cartridges . Although it is fine for letters , school and general office work , photo printing is weak when compared to printers that use additional color cartridges . The lack of a feeder for multi-page scanning and any fax capability also limit the NX625 's usefulness in many situations . Offsetting that , the designers have optimized it for print speed ... if you need to print multi-page documents , the NX625 is really fast . Let 's look at it in more detail ... Installation - I installed this printer on several PCs ( running Windows 7 and Vista ) and one Mac ( running Snow Leopard ) . Installation was simple on all the computers , at least after I finally followed the directions and used the installation disk . Since ( like most men ) I know that following instructions is a primary cause of ED , I had problems the first time ... all the computers identified the printer as a `` NX620 Series '' , not specifically the NX625 , and were unable to download the drivers from the web . When I followed the instructions and used the disk to load the drivers , it worked just fine . My spouse hopes that I 'll eventually recover.Printing - The NX625 is an inexpensive printer using just cyan , magenta , yellow and black ink cartridges . It shows . Although it 's fine for letters , school and general office work , the quality of photo printing is weak when compared to my Epson Artisan 810 ( replaced by theEpson Artisan 835 Color Inkjet All-In-One ( C11CA73201 ) ) which also uses light magenta and light cyan cartridges . Also , the dot size is rather large , with a noticeable stippling as colors blend together . This is n't present in printers specifically designed for photographic printing . ( I suspect that the relatively large dot size is a design trade-off to increase the pages-per-minute print speed . Fewer dots require less computer processing and allow the print head to be moved back and forth faster . ) On the positive side , the NX625 can handle a decent range of paper types . It has a built-in duplexer that 's flush with the back panel . My older Epson has the duplexer hanging a couple of inches out the back , which has always been annoying ... it prevents the printer from being pushed against with a wall . The paper tray is flimsy , but it works and holds enough paper that it 's not always running out . The output tray is also thin plastic , with enough ridges on the underside to keep it rigid.Copying and Scanning - The NX625 is strictly a one page at-a-time flatbed scanner . Slightly more expensive models incorporate a feeder to allow you to scan a multipage document without standing there , continuously opening and shutting the cover . Copy quality is ok , and is obviously subject to the same issues that affect print quality.Faxing - The NX625 is not the printer to buy if you need to send a lot of faxes ... it does n't have any fax capability.Ink - There are two ink cartridge sets available for the NX625 . TheEpson Durabrite Ultra Ink , Black ( T125120 ) andEpson Durabrite Ultra Ink , Color Multipack ( CMY ) ( T125520 ) is the standard capacity set . TheEpson Durabrite Ultra Ink , Black ( T127120 ) andEpson Durabrite Ultra Ink , Color Multipack ( CMY ) ( T127520 ) have more ink , but are quite a bit more expensive . As with any printer , ink costs far outweigh the initial printer cost . I have n't used it enough to get a solid estimate of per page printing cost , but will update this review when I do.Conclusion - Think carefully about your needs before purchasing the NX625 . Other printers are available for nominally more money that incorporate faxing and have a document feeder . Because of the cost of the ink cartridges , I expect the operating cost to be fairly high . The high print speed is its main claim to fame , but , in my opinion , that 's not enough to make up for the other factors . As a result , I 'm just giving it two stars .	-1
I bought a sharpie pain pen in black years ago and still have it and it works wonderfully . THESE NEW SHARPIE PAINTS ARE TRASH by comparison . Why ? 1 . The black and red ink runs , and the silver and gold shrinks to nothing under resin even after fully dried while the older brand did not do this and worked like a true artist quality tool . it ruin two of my pieces that I now have to re do . I hate this garbage.2 . The ink streaks and is not a solid opaque even after the marker tip is saturated with ink.3 . The formula seems like it 's ONLY good for tagging.4.THE TIPS FALL OUT ! ! ! i was shocked that not one but all except the white tip fell out while trying to prime it and I was VERY careful in what I did . Ink got everywhere ! I had to manually reinsert the tip , and even still it did not soak up the ink well enough to make an opaque non streaking line.5 . The red is pastel orange and looks disgusting.In summery if you are 13 and want to tag all over your schools bathroom to be a rebel buy this , because , it was actually made for you . If you want to work with a quality marker for art purposes that you 'd like to be more permanent and flexible when mixing media , buy another brand ! Even when NOT using resin this is a poor product as the ink is not good quality and the marker tips fall out as if you 'd bought something very cheap . The gold is pretty , but getting it to work for you , well , good luck.Buy another brand . Sharpie FAILED big time on these pens . the on	-1
worthless junk . Should have just bought an OEM drum ( which is what I ended up having to do anyways ) . This thing did not work straight out of the box	-1
Bought this cartridge for a new Brother HL-2270DW . In less than 2 or 3 hundred pages the toner light started flashing and the printer refused to print . I did not believe that the cartridge could possibly be out of toner , so I searched the web and found the following instructions to reset the out of toner condition : ===================- Open the front cover and leave open while completing the following steps.- Turn the printer off.- Hold the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) while turning the printer on . All panel lights should be on.- Release the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) .- Press the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) 2 times.- Pause . All panel lights should be on.- Press the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) 5 times.The toner light should be off . ( error may be flashing ) The paper light should be on or flashing.- Close cover . The ready light should be the only light on.====================The printer functioned fine after the reset . I have no idea how long the `` fix '' will last.A pox on companies that build devices like this.====================ONE YEAR LATER April 16 , 2013So I have had this printer for one year now and I must say , that except for the above problem , it has functioned flawlessly . In retrospect it has proved to be very cost effective and efficient.====================ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER February 9 , 2014Many readers have suggested that I should reconsider the one star review.I appreciate their point , especially as I am coming up on two years of ownership and the printer is still performing well . ( Subject to an occasional reset . ) But I just ca n't get passed what I take to be intentional misinformation by Brother to their customers causing them to buy unneeded toner . That just seems dishonest to me . But I will say this , if I were in the market for a similar printer I believe that the HL-2270DW would be a good choice as long as one knew about the bogus out of toner problem.I have received feedback from many people who have saved a lot of money by extending the life of their toner cartridges . For that reason more than any other I believe I will let the review stand.====================ADDENDUM April 9 , 2014Yesterday the printer decided that I should replace the drum . The drum light would flash and any attempt to print resulted in an error . The last prints looked excellent so I was not about to replace a good drum . I tried a drum reset but it did not work so I did a Brother HL-2270dw - Factory reset and now all is fine.This is how I did it:1 . Turn off the printer.2 . Hold the GO button while you turn the printer on . Hold the button until all the LEDs light up and the Ready LED light turns off.3 . Release GO , all the LEDs will turn off.4 . Press GO ten times . The printer will now restart .	-1
Really , really disappointing . We bought this ink cartridge about 2 weeks ago . We have a small business and we print a fair amount , but this toner cartridge just did not last and the & # 34 ; needs toner & # 34 ; indicator is already on .	-1
I 've only had this cartidge a couple months and I have the warning message . I have shaken the cartidge a few times which always seems to extend the life but it has not stopped the warning . The same thing happened with my Canon laser printer . Maybe I 'm printing more than I think . I 'm wondering how everybody knows how many pages have printed from the cartidge . You ca n't be counting them out .	-1
Either my cartridge is defective or my printer is defective . I ordered from Amazon , not from a 3rd party . I wonder if I got a counterfeit product .	-1
See my review of the Brother MFC7460DN Ethernet Monochrome Printer for which I bought this cartridge . I have yet to find a reliable non-Brother cartridge to replace these . Therefore , I am forced to use them in the printer . They are horrible from a & # 34 ; how much toner you get & # 34 ; perspective . If I print 2500 sheets with one of these I consider myself lucky . For comparison , I have another Brother printer that takes the TN580 cartridge . I have found several refillers that make a reliable replacement cart . I get between 7000-9000 sheets out of those for about 1/4th the price of the OEM product .	-1
I bought this as a replacement copier . All printer I have ever had I could use as a printer for your computer or by itself as a copier . This printer you can ONLY use with your computer . There was NO mention of this on the description before ordering or on the box when I received it . I learned about it when I set the printer up and found out there is no place to place my the document I wanted to print . It was very disappointing , especially since I will have to go to the expense of returning it .	-1
quality is n't bad , but this thing wastes SO MUCH ink . it does n't have an economy print feature , so you 're going to end up shelling more on ink cartridges than is worth the quality , speed , and hardware . from a cost perspective , i was better off investing in a more expensive but longer lasting laser printer .	-1
Owned 6 HP Printers over 20 year span ... bought the HP Deskjet 952C WORKHORSE that LASTED almost 20 years of CONSTANT printing including photo printing and an 855C for my kids . Then I bought 4 more in the last 2 months that were ALL DEFECTIVE including this one ! ! Very familiar with these ... what HP has done is make the printers cheaper and ink cartridges SMALLER so you pay for the printer , ( IF it works for a few months ) , over and OVER again ; it 's a `` MONEY THING '' and people are buying these blindly without doing the research . **Please do yourself a favor and invest in an inexpensive LASER Printer instead that will be much more cost effective in the end . Really see what meets your needs and buy that one , not the cheapest one ! ! **~ > GOOD LUCK ! !	-1
Now I hate to give bad reviews but this DEFINITELY deserves ZERO stars ! Terrible at printing letters , it never feeds correctly , I have to manually feed it one by one , what a time waster ! And it always gets cut off on the left ! When I tab everything over , it prints correctly and cuts off on the right ! It ca n't take refilled inks , NO way so I have to buy genuine inks , and sometimes it thinks it 's NOT ! Sometimes the color will quitworking and you ca n't print unless you have both cartridges in ! After using this for several months , the printer starts to printslooooowly I mean TEN minutes per page SLOW ! It 's a hit or miss.Sometimes it prints okay but then other times it 'll take halfan hour to finish a print job ! @ Thirty bucks you get what you pay for ! The ink is also really expensive , after buying 2 packs you can buy a new '' disposable '' printer . Get a Brother instead , cheaper inks and easierto setup ( especially wireless ) . I also have an HP 3000 and still tothis day ca n't get it to network wirelessly !	-1
I 've had this printer for over a year and it works fine , but the toners are just way too expensive . I paid $ 29.99for this printer when it originally went on sale and , asI stated , it 's a pretty OK light weight printer foreveryday stuff . No complaints there.I just bought a set of 61XL toners at the local big boxand they were $ 56 . I was out of ink and did n't want towait . It 's pretty ridiculous when the toner 's almosttwice the price of the printer.This is a really poor deal for the consumer , so I willgive HP and their printer/toners a low rating ongeneral principle .	-1
I really wanted to like this unit . I 've had other Canon printers and have had good luck with them . Unfortunately , this one could n't even complete the setup process . It displayed an error message right out of the box . Canon tech support ( which fortunately is in the US ) advised that the print head carrier was not being released by the purge unit . This is apparently due to a manufacturing defect and is not user serviceable , so I 'm returning the unit .	-1
If you listen carefully , you can hear this huge machine singing to Saturday Night Fever Song `` I will be jammin ' YEAH ! I will be jammin ' YEAH ! '' and that is what it does . Out of about 10 print jobs of only 1 or 2 pages each , there was a paper jam on 9 of the print jobs . Some of the jams involved jamming more than once . It takes forever to reset and be ready to print again . I will be returning.I will add that the hardware and wireless set up was extremely easy . However , when I tried to set up for ePrint , I got the error `` FAILED TO UPDATE '' twice so I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so I called customer support and they said I was doing everything right , sometimes there server is just behind and/or having difficulties . Finally it did update and you can rename your printer with whatever email address you would like at the domain @ hpeprint.com.This printer is larger than described in the Amazon listing because of the duplexer for two-sided copying and the paper tray . It is gigantic . The rep said it is so big because the print heads are separate from the print cartridges which will help save on ink costs . I will never know about that because I will not deal with all the ink and paper cost lost on all the paper jams . HP Rep said he would send me information on clearing jams as the paperwork that comes with the printer did not say much , but I did n't hear from the HP rep again.Good bye 8500A Pro ! Do n't let my door hit you in the	-1
Oh how I despise this all in one machine . I 've had it for over a year and will trash it soon because it 's just so annoying . It eats ink and the ink is very expensive . You can not print even in black unless all the color ink cartridges are in . Scan to email function works well , but why ca n't I delete email addresses right from the screen ? It 's a major hassle to have to log in online and then delete or change your address book . why ? I would NEVER recommend this printer to anyone . Do n't buy it ! It does n't work nearly as well as my older Cannon .	-1
HP Officejet Pro 8500A Plus Wireless e-All-in-One ( CM756A # B1H ) This is not my first HP printer but is the first one I got that was DOA . When I set up my printer for the first time , nothing I could do would make the sheet feeder , feed . I called tech support and went through basic trouble shooting with him . After he determined it was truly broken he arrange a swap out . He warned me that I would get a refurbished unit . I had no recourse as Amazon Vine supplied the unit and I knew they had no more . So I processed the request with the tech . The replacement printer arrived quickly and to my surprise it was n't in a plain box . As a matter of fact it was a brand new printer and it all worked right out of the box . This was better than expected and overall a good experience using HP tech support.Now for the all-in-one printer . It is fairly fast at printing . That said , it 's kind of noisy too . There always seems to be activity going on and it 's noisy activity . Also , this printer jams more often than any other printer I 've ever owned , mostly from the internal tray . I think there is , IMHO , a design flaw in the tray design . There is no tension bar to slide into place behind the paper stack . I think this lack of pressure at the rear of the paper lets it go slack over time and the result is a jam . I 've never had a printer that did n't snug up the paper stack . The actual print quality is pretty good . Text is sharp and pictures are crisp . This is not a photo printer but if you use photo paper the results are very acceptable . It is a good mix of service . Still if you need excellent quality photos this is not the printer for you.This printer is a duplexing printer and will also photo copy in the duplex mode . This worked very well but I did get a jam once on a 30 page duplex test run . I did test some HP Premium Presentation Paper and the results using pictures and text was quite nice . I was very pleased with the resulting document.The touch display is large and easy to use , but sometimes I have to press twice to register the command . It also uses large ink cartridges which can be expensive , but you wo n't have to replace them as often as some . The prerequisite media readers are present too and work as expected . Overall this is a decent device but I ca n't give it a whole hearted recommendation . A nice bonus was my iPad could print to this printer starting mid-December . I consider it a mid-level performer and not really up to the HP standards of the past.Update : July 8 , 2011It jams and jams and jams . I rerate this to a one star printer . Stay away . Sorry HP . Disappointed.Update : November 8 , 2011After the last firmware update the jamming problem has reduced . You could blow me over with a feather to believe software would fix a jamming issue . I 'd still say avoid this one . I saw the new 8600 at a Staples store . They redesigned it with a normal removable paper tray . It has an adjustable brace at the rear of the paper . LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE HAD ON THIS ONE ! ! !	-1
I really like the printer . The quality of prints and the speed are great . BUT , when I suffered my first paper jam I realized that this printer does not open up like in the clam style of my previous HP Printers . I 've owned many HP Printers over the years and did n't know that was an item to look out for . It is extremely difficult to get inside the printer to remove the jammed paper . Very frustrating and I 'm ready to trade it in .	-1
I have owned this product since it 's release and I have waited and continue to wait for HP to actually work out the kinks and make this product live up to it 's potential . Years after initial purchase the software is still buggy as heck , as you update your operating software for your computer HP does not release updates in a timely fashion , and the worst issue of all is the wireless printing feature has a mind of it 's own . Some days it works , other days it does not . I have trouble shot it to the point where I can definitively say that it is not my network connection or any other variable that is on the users end.Due to the fact that HP refuses to release an update making the printer compatible with the newest version of Apple 's operating system I have had to use backdoor means in which to print and scan , more often than not resorting to using a printer cable to print and scan . Nearly $ 400 after initial purchase and I ca n't even print wirelessly . BUY WITH CAUTION.On a brighter note this printer and it 's flaws since day one have made me more resolute than ever in not purchasing another product made by HP or their subsidiaries . It really is a terrible product ; moreover , a terrible company that produces shoddy products that are an insult to the consumer and common decency . This is not my first go-around with an HP product but it will be the last .	-1
The ink I bought was `` Sold by Quantum Electronics , Inc. and Fulfilled by Amazon . '' It came without the retail box , with some BS note about not shipping the box is protecting the environment . The importance of the box , though , is that it contains the EXPIRATION DATE for the cartridges . No box means you ca n't know how old the ink is.Is this their way of selling expired ink cartridges ? They do n't give you the information you need to know.I should have spent a couple of bucks more and bought the ink at Target .	-1
These just would not work with the printer . Put in two others , same model , printer worked fine . Waste of money .	-1
I had one of these for over a year and it was the worst printer I have ever had or seen . Oh , it printed OK. Photo 's look nice , fairly fast & easy to setup the wifi wireless connection . It 's the ink consumption that ticks me off ! I bought it because it has separate cartridges for each color thinking I could just replace what ever color ran out first . Wrong . First set of ink cartridges was gone in no time even though I hardly printed anything . Figured it was because they were the ones that came with it and HP was just being cheap by sending ink cartridges with it that were only half , or less , full . It would n't let me just replace the black and keep printing text pages either . No , it had to have all of them replaced . I bet I did n't get a dozen pages printed with it over a 3 to 4 month period and it was out of ink . ALL of the cartridges were empty ! And I did n't even print a single photo , only text pages . I got one more set and put in it . This time I shut it down when I was n't printing something . Did n't matter . Every time it was turned on it ran a full head cleaning cycle before it would print . I even put the extra large black cartridge in it but that did n't matter . It used the Photo Black for text printing . And guess what ? In less than 4 months every cartridge was empty even though I only used it a few time to print something . Except for the extra large black , it was still over half full but the thing would n't print anything with the other ones empty . This is the first printer that I retired before it was actually broken . I wonder if it was intentional by HP to make money selling ink cartridges ? After this one , I 'm never buying another HP printer again .	-1
I bought this printer in the fall of 2010 . The printer is used to print maybe 6 pages a month . Even with infrequent use there have been problems.The wireless feature can only be used if the requesting computer is literally next to the printer . Even then , it consstantly disconnects . This has been the biggest disappointment of the printer.I 've only had to replace the black ink twice and the color once since 2010-but this is because we 've pretty much have given up on printing ( trees cheering ) . The only concession is that I got an excellent deal on it.My final thoughts ... if you need a printer for infrequent use and you 're able to get this at a good price ... go for it ! If you have your heart set on easy , wireless printing , it would be beneficial to look at other models .	-1
UPDATE 11/27/2011 : I do not recommend this printer . Despite firmware updates last year and the printer working for a while , the sleep issue came back and never went away . In order for the printer to work , needed to unplug and replug in to unfreeze it and then use . HP never ultimately addressed the issues . Very disappointing . I have moved on.UPDATE 12/11/2010 : Have been running a firmware update for over a week now ... . while the printer locked up once , it could have been due to a power fluctuation . Overall the issue listed in the CON below seems to be resolved so far . While the printer is nice , HP still gets 2 stars for how this was handled ( they should have been responding to the many posts in their support forums for their new product.. also disappointed that an issue like this made it through whatever testing they do ) .ORIGINAL REVIEW : Pros : - The printer was relatively easy to set up wireless ... worked for a mix of Windows 7 x64 computers and Windows XP laptop ( all wireless ) - The speed of the printing is quick and the quality of typical documents is nice- Photo printing looked very nice on photo paper- The two trays that come with the printer , one for normal paper and one for photo paper are a fantastic ideaCons : ( arrrghhh ... frustrating con , hence the 3 star deduction ) - The printer would go to sleep and infrequently never wake up ... it would take unplugging and re-plugging the printer power cord to reboot the printer ( this takes some time , the printer takes about a minute or so to re-power up ) . I researched the issue on the HP website forums and found a number of users were having the same issue . There are no firmware updates to fix this issue , in fact , there 's no evidence that HP recognizes this as an issue and is addressing it ... THE FIX AND ONLY HELP ... on the forum , an HP employee ( who takes pains to stress he 's being helpful and not responding as an authorized HP representative ) is the only ray of light ... he provides very nice step by step details on how to fix the problem ( effectively , change the IP from dynamic to static on the printer ) . While I am very comfortable doing such a thing , I can see the majority of users not being comfortable doing this and effectively being left with a printer that locks up every day . HP really needs to get their stuff together and at least say something to the effect that they are working on the issue.Disappointed in HP support.At this point , I would not recommend this printer to anyone except people with higher than average level of tech knowledge .	-1
I received the scale and tested it . It worked fine plugged in . Then I noticed the battery compartment door was gone and n where in the box . I want to be able to use the battery feature if needed . Without a door to keep the battery in place it would be difficult to do . I returned it for a full refund and ended up getting one at a local big box store .	-1
I really like the size of this scale as it would fit on my desk but the scale was not accurate and I kept having to add postage at POffice . There was no way to adjust it.so disappointed ... .I would like a desk scale that 's accurate .	-1
UPDATE -- Since I wrote this review I have recently encountered a ton of issues with the driver ( s ) . For some reason , I can no longer scan . Printing is also problematic . I have researched the issue , and the scanner issue is a serious one . There are many customers who have never been able to scan , and HP is unable/unwilling to solve the issue . What is the point of having an All-in-One if the scanner function does n't work ? I went from very happy/satisfied to disappointed/angry.I had been using a Canon inkjet printer before I received this HP . I have never owned an HP before , so I was curious about it.What I disliked most about this product was getting it out of the box and set up . Honestly , it took about 45 minutes to get the thing out of its packing box and get all the tape and cardboard off of it before I could even turn it on . Maybe there 's a reason why it 's so well packaged , but it did seem excessive.It does take a while , too , for the unit to turn on and become functional . It makes me want to leave it on , even though I 've been told that wastes ink.Still , the PC recognized it right away , the drivers were loaded correctly , and it printed its test page successfully . I am happy with the print quality , and the actual speed of printing is good.I love the scanner . Previously I had used a stand-alone Epson scanner because it was easy to use , and I did n't care for the Canon scanner . This one is wonderful because all I had to do was press the scan button , and the rest was a piece of cake . Even better , it gave me the option of scanning and saving as a PDF -- in the past , I 've had to convert JPEGs to PDFs.I also like the sleek black style of this all-in-one . It matches my black case PC perfectly.I am very happy with this HP product and have almost forgotten about how long it took to get the darn thing out of the box and de-taped .	-1
I purchased this because I wanted a faster laser printer . First of all it comes with very poor installation instructions . Pictures in a book . I managed to get the printer together and install the prin cartridge . The problem arose when I put the windows operating disc in the computer . My computer suddenly made a : ( face and indicated it had run into a problem . I hav not been able to get my computer online or access the Internet . This machin is going back to th store . I bought it only 3 days ago . Hopefully HP support will be able to get me back online . If you have a 2 year old computer and run windows 8 do not buy this . I am extremely disappointed	-1
Did not work with my brand new iMac ( Mountain Lion ) . Being returned . Not sure why it works with some iMacs and not others . I tried the advice that other Mac owners have left here for installing this device , with no luck .	-1
I bought this for my office and it 's easy to assemble , but very unstable and rickety . I just put it in the corner and try not to touch it . Not great for everyday use as the hinges come off easily . It 's definitely not sturdy . Oh well ... .I should have gone and bought a good one at the store .	-1
These are small and a bit flimsy . I guess I did n't read description closely and these turned out to be quite tiny .	-1
cheaply made and not a good deal . the paint is heavy and I just felt like it was not a good value ... I had also hoped for a thinker plastic container but this is cheap made , cheap made , really I mean it cheap made	-1
These toner are not compatible as they claim to be . They plain DO NOT WORK . I am attempting to return them and will update this review with the results.edit , 6/18/13 - The seller has given me a full refund . They asked which model of printer I use . I use an hp 1102w . Perhaps they are working on compatibility but these units did not work in my 1102w . Cheers to the supplier for a painless refund process .	-1
I ordered this size and had no idea they were so small . Unless you are mailing out a pair of earrings or some small jewelry that 's not in a box , this mailer is a complete waste of money . Be warned .	-1
The price point of this wide format MFP was too low to resist . I was able to get rid of my old fax machine and my temperamental HP wide format inkjet and combine them into one machine , freeing up much needed space in my office . Free up space , it most certainly did , but the benefits of owning this frustrating piece of technology ends there.As for large format printing , this puppy sure handles paper up to 13x19 , POORLY . If you 're lucky enough to get the paper to feed without jamming or trying to grab ten sheets at once , it usually feeds crooked and prints everything on the page at an angle . Then , when it gets to the bottom of the page , it freaks out and tries to suck back the freshly printed page back into the printer for some reason . At best , this rips the bottom of the page . At worst , it feeds the page back in so far as to jam the print heads that are still flying back and forth . Printing 13x19 is a great function , but only if it works . This machine literally has a 10 % success rate with large format paper.Printing on regular sized paper can be frustrating as well , as this printer likes to feed multiple sheets at once , or none at all . Reposition the paper in the tray , and it may then print or jam up on you . Depends on its mood . Trying to print wirelessly ? Sure it has the function , but you will wait FOREVER for this thing to start printing a page . When it does finish printing , each page is shot out the front of this thing like a clown being shot out of a cannon at the Circus . Forget to flip up that paper tray `` stop '' at the end of the tray and you 'll end up with freshly printed pages all over the floor of your office.Copying , Scanning , and Faxing is handled fairly well , except for the fact that you have to use the touch screen interface to enter the numbers . Another exercise in frustration . The touchscreen key-pad is really fussy and either does n't respond to your touch at all or responds by entering two or three numbers rather than just the one you 're trying to press . Frustrating . Once you get the number entered , faxes go through as expected , though the paper feeder is louder than any other I 've heard anywhere.If you can actually get this thing to print a page correctly , the print quality is quite nice , as expected . However getting this thing to work on a regular basis over the last year of having it has been an exercise in frustration . I am writing this while researching a replacement for this machine . Ca n't wait for the day I get to throw it on the trash heap . I generally like HP printers , but this one is a total dud .	-1
This product is fantastic easy to install and use wirelessly or not , prints clear images and I love that I can now print larger images ! I had no problem setting this baby up and printing right away some wireless drama but that was my own fault for not knowing all my codes correctly.Prints faster than any other printer I 've owned too . I much prefer the separate color ink tanks uses less ink and you save money when you buy the XL size inks.UPDATE 2013 : Well after using this machine for a few years now I can honestly say this is NOT a great printer it worked pretty well for the first year but after that started developing all kinds of annoying problems.SLEEP MODE : is terrible if you let your machine go to sleep you are going to have to unplug it and then plug it back in to get it to turn back on.WIRELESS : Do n't bother I have tried and failed ever since I got this thing to get it to hook up wirelessly , does not happen ! SCANNING large documents : well it might print large docs nicely but its large format scanning is terrible and never matches up cleanly..if I had realized that was how the scanning would be I would never have gotten rid of my massive ( and very heavy ) large format scanner even though I do not do that much large format scanning anymore.Key pad functions : May or may not work ; I have never been able to get this dumb thing to scan any document without opening up the software window through my computer despite there being keys on the keypad to do it . Copying sort of works but can be temperamental when you use the top feeder versus the flatbed ESPECIALLY with multi-page docs.LAST STRAW : Now I can not even get this thing to print anymore it keeps telling me I have the wrong size paper even though I have it set up for letter and there is letter paper in the tray . I am going to try and delete the printer and reload the entire thing but this is the last straw once I have used up the last of the ink this printer is GONE ! No more HP printers for me I am going back to Epson probabaly .	-1
As the HP printer model crumbles , consumers should take effort to save money and hasten the demise of this web of price opacity . As an owner of an OfficeJet 8500 who has had to painfully replace the cartridges with `` genuine HP ink '' for tidy sum , I found a better alternative . Specifically , you can purchase re-manufactured cartridges for one tenth the price . This strategy may seem obvious - but yet it is n't . Initially you will get frustrated with `` damaged cartridge '' alerts . Yet , the simple strategy is just to purchase three of the very , very low cost re-manufactured cartridge four packs . As soon as one color starts giving you trouble , remove and replace with another cartridge . You will still come out way , way ahead.On a more positive note , the front loading design of these cartridges is vastly superior to predecessors . No need to flip open the top and wait for the cartridge holders to reposition to an accessible location .	-1
I gave this ink a one star , because it was shipped in a padded envelope , with the cap off and the aluminum seal on the bottle came loose and ink went all over inside of the envelope - I had to just throw it away - What a mess !	-1
I bought this for my daughter and it broke after 13 months . The machine gave us a error code and it means something has to be replaced . The D420 was n't used very much and I am extremely disappointed with this POS . Since I paid less than $ 120 for it , I will be donating it to charity rather than sending it back to Canon for repair . My time is too valuable . D420 is definitely not recommended.12/1/2012- updateThe error code is E225 . Google Canon E225 and see how many hits you will see . It is not just the D420 having this problem . Other Canon models also have the same problem .	-1
I ca n't believe they do n't include the USB cable that is required inorder to use the product.Thats like selling a car without wheels ! Furthermore , network setup is not possible without purchase of a print server.As for performance , I wo n't know until I receive the USB cable and print server ( another 5-10 day wait , argh ! ) .Even if the performance of this printer/scanner is perfect , I will not change my star ratting because of the lack of the USB cable.Update : after having to drive 90 miles round trip to nearest Bestbuy for a USB cable that should have been included with the product ( our local Wal-Mart or Target did not carry this cable ) I have the following to say:1 ) print quality is very good2 ) product construction is very cheap , a couple of plastic pieces have broken off already.I expected better from a company that makes top of the line products.My next printer will more than likely be an HP printer again.Update : I have been using this printer for over a year now . It still prints fairly well . Funny thing though , since the third month of use the red error light has been lit telling me that the toner cartridge is empty and needs to be replaced ... 7 months later ; I 'm still printing from the same toner cartridge ... slick trick from cannon to get people to purchase toner cartridges before they need to , and they are not cheap ... .I still do not recommend this printer ... I have had better experiences with printers from HP and even Epson.UPDATE 9/29/13The toner cartridge finally ran out of toner . I checked the price of replacement cartridges and found that they cost about as much as a new printer so I bought a new HP printer instead and guess what ... it came with a usb cable , maybe cannon could learn to do like wise and not be so cheap . Not that I needed it , just making my point from my previous post above .	-1
I tried using multiple hosts and everything else I could the of , now here is the part where I tell you guys what my skills are so no one will think that I must be dumb because I could not setup a printer ... ..I have been working on computers for 4 days , well make that five since it 's past midnight in my time zone ... ..I eventually donated this guy to the Salvation Army , I always shoot my gear to the Salvation Army assume its something they want ... ..	-1
This black HON HVL521 mesh back work chair was fairly easy to assemble with the exception of putting the the back onto the seat portion . You put the arms on first which then makes it a little tricky to find a space on which to put the bottom upside down in order to slip the back into place . It is a one person job until that point and then you need a second person.Once assembled it is sturdy and comfortable with the ability to adjust the height of the seat . I like the molded plastic arms ( with past chairs the first thing to go was the leather/cloth arms ) , which are not full arms but 3/4 length arms with a slight indentation in the middle in which to place your arms.The mesh backing is comfortable and has a curved molded system several inches from the actual meshing which adds additional support when you lean back . The whole thing is not gigantic and would fit any room arrangement . It has a slightly futuristic look ! We have low pile carpet with dense padding in our office area and the wheels can actually move while you are sitting on the chair , but I would recommend a floor desk pad for the best moveability.11-10-12 : About one year after having reviewed this product initially the seat of the chair is no longing staying at the height that we want it to . So each morning we set it to the proper height and by lunch time it is back done to the lowest position which is too low for us . Time for a new chair I think .	-1
This is the chair I received through the Vine program instead of the chair that was offered . I posted a review on the product page of the other chair , based on how well the chair I received measured up to the product description . But , I 'm adding this review on this product page for any potential customers.This chair was very easy to assemble . It also looks okay.Unfortunately : -- Aside from being able to roll the chair around and raise or lower it , it 's not adjustable. -- Leaning back is only possible if you plant your feet on the floor and push , and the chair only moves a little. -- No discernable lumbar support . So do n't plan on spending much time sitting in comfort. -- Not a lot of padding ( none on the back of the chair ) . -- I do n't think the material is that sturdy . Certainly not as good as another chair we recently purchased.I would have liked to rate this chair between a 2 and a 3 , but all things considered , it 's more toward the `` 2 '' end of the scale.It would be okay for a high school student 's room or for someone who does n't spend a huge amount of time in the home office , but if you want something you 'll be able to work in , comfortably , this may not be your cup of tea either .	-1
I purchased this because I needed a duplex , wireless printer . Unfortunately , despite having successfully at least 4 other non-computer devices to my wireless network in the past year or so , I was unable to get this printer connected.To do the wireless setup , you 're supposed to first connect the printer using either a USB cable or a network cable . I tried it both ways , but although setup said that the printer ( sometimes ) detected my wireless network , it never successfully connected to it ; the diagnostics always either said I had the wrong wireless security type , or that the network could n't be connected . Well , I tried changing my WiFi setup to about 4 different types of security and no luck.Just for fun I also tried configuring the printer through its web interface ; although I could ( sometimes ) reach the printer that way , and could fiddle with the wireless settings there too , once again , no luck connecting.I think I attempted to set up the printer on my Wi-Fi about 8 times , each time trying something a little different , before I decided to throw in the towel and send it back . I figured I had tried enough different things that calling support would be a waste of time.The only other item worth noting is that when the printer was warming up and preparing to print , the lights in the room dimmed briefly , so it 's obviously sucking a lot of power occasionally . This did n't happen with my old laser printer , or with the new one I eventually got after returning this dud .	-1
I 've had two brother printers over the past decade . They were both quiet . This printer has a side fan that is as loud as a leaf blower ! I could not believe what I heard . If you print just one page , the fan activates for 10 minutes ! Then it shuts off . No way to disable the fan . It continues to run after the one minute sleep mode kicks in . You must suffer for the full 10 minutes.For some , they may not mind it . I do mind it . Returned it the next day for a comparable HP printer . The HP is silent . I am now happy .	-1
The set-up and print quality was as expected for its price range . I was not able to set-up the WiFi as it could not be detected despite multiple attempts and configurations . The LAN connection worked well at first and then was mysteriously lost and could not be reconnected . Finally had to switch to the USB connection which worked as expected . Overall a disappointed for a tech savvy person .	-1
We 've gone through two TN-450 ( $ 45 ) cartridges with this printer and we 've found that we get at most 600 pages ( often with images ) out of the alleged 2,600 TN-450 cartridges . Not only that , the printer drum is only good for 10,500 pages ! This is an excellent printer for very occasional use . If you are a student , or parent of students , however , you should NOT buy this printer . It will cost around $ 450 a year to own it.Instead consider something like the HL-6180DW , a bit more to purchase , but far more economical and longer lasting.With the 2270DW Brother has figured out how to turn a low cost laser printer into a high consumable cost ink jet printer . That 's a sad innovation .	-1
It was upsetting that the first toner that came with the printer ran out very very fast . It makes me think almost if this was a used product that they sold as new .	-1
I replaced a four year old Brother HL-5370DW duplex printer with this one after an electrical storm wiped out everything with a USB port that was in my studio . This printer is not constructed nearly as durably as the old printer , and is a lot slower than the old printer when duplexing . It is also a lot more noisy than the old printer . The toner cartridges for this printer ( TN-450 ) have much less capacity than the 5370 , making it much more expensive to maintain . Its print quality is fine but I doubt I would ever buy another one of these ,	-1
Neverending nightmare . From the beginning it has been the most trying piece of equipment we 've had . It 's disconnected itself from the wireless network . The steps it takes to reconnect , you have to be a marathon athlete . Let 's say it somehow prints , occasionally if you connect the USB port . The blooming rollers will not scoop up the copy paper . Rather , they just spin and spin , squeaking and squawking , sucking up electricity ( guzzling it ) humming along like an electric train , with nothing to show for it . And that 's IF IF IF it 's in the mood the print via USB . Just . Do n't . Do . It .	-1
I have had this printer for seven months . I had to reinstall the printer software on my wireless laptop , which is running OSX 10.8.5.Surprise # 1 : The installation CD would not longer run . I got an error message saying that the disc was incompatible with my system software . Thanks , guys.I downloaded a new driver , and then : Surprise # 2 : When I contacted Brother they confirmed that the installation disc was not compatible with my system software , and no newer installation CD is available . They sent me detailed information for resetting and manually reconfiguring the printer . The only problem was that the command on the printer that was supposed to tell me the printer IP address simply did not work . Without the IP address , there is no way to connect to the machine wirelessly . I did research on the web for alternative methods of finding the IP address , and all those methods yielded a blank IP address for the printer . So apparently when I reset it to the factory settings as recommended by Brother , it wiped out the location information and the command that was supposed to reconfigure it did not work.At this point , it has become more trouble than its worth , especially given the fact that Brother seems to have a rather casual attitude about keeping up to date with Mac system updates.Moral of the story - If you are running OSX 10.8.5 ( or higher , I assume ) , good luck.I am extremely disappointed . The printer worked well up to this point .	-1
Bought this Brother HL-2270DW less than 30 days ago . Within 2 days I replaced the starter cartridge with a new TN-420 thinking I would hold the starter cartridge in reserve . In less than 2 or 3 hundred pages the toner light started flashing and the printer refused to print . I did not believe that the cartridge could possibly be out of toner , so I searched the web and found the following instructions to reset the out of toner condition : ===================- Open the front cover and leave open while completing the following steps.- Turn the printer off.- Hold the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) while turning the printer on . All panel lights should be on.- Release the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) .- Press the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) 2 times.- Pause . All panel lights should be on.- Press the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) 5 times . ( I have been told to press 6 times for the TN-450 cartridge . ) The toner light should be off . ( error may be flashing ) The paper light should be on or flashing.- Close cover . The ready light should be the only light on.====================The printer functioned fine after the reset . I have no idea how long the `` fix '' will last.A pox on companies that build devices like this.====================ONE YEAR LATER April 16 , 2013So I have had this printer for one year now and I must say , that except for the above problem , it has functioned flawlessly . In retrospect it has proved to be very cost effective and efficient.====================ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER February 9 , 2014Many readers have suggested that I should reconsider the one star review.I appreciate their point , especially as I am coming up on two years of ownership and the printer is still performing well . ( Subject to an occasional reset . ) But I just ca n't get passed what I take to be intentional misinformation by Brother to their customers causing them to buy unneeded toner . That just seems dishonest to me . But I will say this , if I were in the market for a similar printer I believe that the HL-2270DW would be a good choice as long as one knew about the bogus out of toner problem.I have received feedback from many people who have saved a lot of money by extending the life of their toner cartridges . For that reason more than any other I believe I will let the review stand.====================ADDENDUM April 9 , 2014Yesterday the printer decided that I should replace the drum . The drum light would flash and any attempt to print resulted in an error . The last prints looked excellent so I was not about to replace a good drum . I tried a drum reset but it did not work so I did a Brother HL-2270dw - Factory reset and now all is fine.This is how I did it:1 . Turn off the printer.2 . Hold the GO button while you turn the printer on . Hold the button until all the LEDs light up and the Ready LED light turns off.3 . Release GO , all the LEDs will turn off.4 . Press GO ten times . The printer will now restart.====================ADDENDUM July 3 , 2014I recently bought another HL-2270DW . It is a great printer as long as you know the caveats discussed above .	-1
While this was a good printer while it worked , it died after just about a year with a 'fuser error ' , which is not worth fixing.I replaced it with the Brother 2240D model , which is cheaper , although not networkable . The main reason I bought another Brother is because it could take the same toner , which I still had a cartridge almost new.Let 's hope the new one lasts longer ... These things are almost like disposables .	-1
There are hundreds of reviews that give this device 5 stars and which led me to make the purchase . However , I give it 1 star as it relates specifically to me and my experience with this adapter . I intended to use this as a backup for the Ooma that I use in my office located behind my house . Let me just say that after having made some tests it would be like using a donkey-drawn cart as a backup for a Rolls Royce.After making all the required connections , the User Guide explains that in order to use this device the called party must have one of these Obi 's as well . None of my friends , relatives or others that I know personally are in possession of this gadget . Therefore this feature is useless to me . Strike one.Although Google Voice is available without this Obi , and I have used it without this Obi , I decided to give it a shot with the Obi just to satisfy my curiosity . The service is actually operable but the connection is very noisy and there is a voice delay which is quite irritable . Using Google voice without any tie in to Obi provides a much better connection . Therefore this feature is useless to me . Strike two.I toyed with the idea of trying to make some type of contact with the vendor to see if some of the problems could be resolved . Then I noticed that there are many reviewers who failed at any attempt to receive support . These reviewers , along with other reviewers who had any negative remarks , received a `` Comment '' from someone who parrotted the same exhortation to everyone that they should make the same contacts that had already been assured to be a total failure . No helpful information was dispensed just a routine gesture with useless advice . I decided not to waste any further time with Obi . Strike three . Yer out !	-1
If you use Google Voice , it serves the purpose , but I do n't like to depend on free services being around forever . BTDT too many times . It says that you can use it with other free services , but I tried hard to get it to work with my paid Skype subscription and it was either too complicated a process for me or it just do n't do it . I searched the internet for a solution but did n't find it there either . I sent it back and ordered Ooma . Now there is a product that I can live with . I opted for Ooma 's premier service which adds all the bells and whistles for $ 10 a month and am very satisfied . Plus up and running in 10 minutes .	-1
I just purchased this device through nettalk duo website & before I bought it I called the sales dept . twice to ask if you could talk unlimited hours with no charge & they said you can talk unlimited hours in the US & Canada . So I bought it . Then after I received the device I called customer service dept . & asked about the unlimited hours & they said there was a limit of 4000 hrs . a month & then I am sure they would bill you extra . Anyway since I was lied to twice I am returning the device because I was mislead just so they can make a sale . To say I am really pissed off is an understatement .	-1
UPDATE : My Duo worked fine for 6 months , I loved it so much I gave it five stars but now it 's down to 2 stars . Late May 2013 my renewal will come up but I 'm switching to MagicJack . The past 2 or 3 months my NetTalk has worked intermittently - I even changed out my router thinking that was the problem . You ca n't trust NetTalk to be there in an emergency . Early on I upped my DSL speed to 6 Mbps from 768K and that made a big difference in call quality , but that was not the problem towards the end . I was constantly having to unplug , wait and reset it to get it to work . Well , if your house was on fire you do n't have time for that.One thing I did love . NetTalk says they do not sell your phone number . I never ported my original AT & T ; landline number . The entire time I 've had NetTalk , not one robocall was received.Still , even though I 'm now not happy with NetTalk , I feel I got my money 's worth , it paid for itself the first month over my large AT & T ; bill I got rid of . *****************************Initial Review from May 2012 : Some complain about having only 3000 minutes a month - that was nevert an issue for me , it 's rare if I make more 2 or 3 calls a day , and never lengthy calls . Being single , 3000 minutes is enough for me , maybe not enough if you have a large family using one account . The last straw and the reason for buying this is two recent AT & T ; rate hikes.Installation was an easy 10 minute task . Go to NetTalk 's web site FIRST to activate your account and get your phone number , THEN plug in the NetTalk device and your base phone as per the Quick Start Guide . The only thing I did differently was I substituted a CAT6 Ethernet Cable I had purchased a few months ago instead of the furnished gray Ethernet cable . It *may* help with transmission problems and they are harder to disconnect due to the extra strong tab - if my cats walk on the battery back-up and DSL line on the floor behind the computer desk , I doubt if a CAT6 cable will come unplugged .	-1
I just should 've read other people 's review before I purchased because someone already said that 5.5 in x 8.5 in paper does not fit in this folder . Now I do n't know what I 'm gon na use them for . Colors are good , material is okay . It would 've been perfect for me if this can hold 5.5 in x 8.5 in .	-1
A slightly advanced basic binder , the rubbery spine is a nice added touch that seems like it will increase the life of the spine , but unfortunately it is impossible to tell right now if that will be true The rings are attached to the inside of the back cover , as is standard with most binders these days . There are interior pockets in the front and back , as well as a clear pocket on the front cover . The front and back cover seem a little sturdier than most binders , and it did hold up fine when my 17 pound cat decided to sit on it while it was lying on my bed one evening , something that has caused dents or even folds in other binders I 've had . Pages do turn smoothly as described and the rings feel well constructed . The $ 10 price seems a bit steep.8/26/2012 Update : While the outside has held up so far under light usage , the rings have not . The rings have not taken any impact and have n't been opened/closed an excessive amount of time , yet the middle ring does not close entirely without me squeezing it shut . Perhaps I opened the rings by pulling on the middle one too often ( something I try not to do ) , but I 've never had binder rings wear out this quickly , not even with more use . I am fairly disappointed since I do like the rubber grip on the spine , but I will eventually be replacing it with another brand . Because of this I simply can not recommend this binder , especially given its price ( currently $ 7.06 to $ 9.91 ) .	-1
I got these to try out with the printer in my department and give to one of my friends who uses a planner , so I had a comrade-in-arms when I tried to figure out how to print these . Nevertheless , it still took us a couple of tries ( used up the `` test sheet '' for sure ) when we tried to print out the tab labels . Also , it seems that the tabs are scaled down to the size of the binder , which I think was the result of someone thinking that aesthetically it would look better , but functionally it 's a little frustrating unless you only need like 5 letters or you want to reduce your font down to very , very tiny sizes.I ended up just giving up on these and neither of us really cared enough to finish the process . It would be much simpler to just hand write the tabs , but it feels sort of like defeating the purpose of having these in the first place .	-1
I have several labelers , my favorite is still the Epson LW-400 , but I was interested in trying this Dymo since it 's much easier to type on a keyboard . I love the Plug and Play and since I have a iMac I was happy to see that OSX was also supported . I installed the battery ( why ) ? , the cartridge and plugged it in and the device immediately shows up in Finder and you run the application . I typed a label and click print and then the device hums to life but no label appeared . After opening I soon realized that the cartridge was defective and while the `` wheel '' was spinning , the tape was not advancing . So I 'm DOA until I pay another $ 10 for a refill and hope that one works . At this point it appears to be the cartridge but I will have to gamble to be sure . For $ 50 , they really should be including more cartridges especially for Vine reviewers . Epson included many different styles and colors for reviewers to try and that 's one of the reasons it remains my favorite.I also do n't understand why this unit has a battery ? If it 's designed to run off USB , what 's the purpose of a battery for power too ? Pros : - Plug and play ... no software to install- Works on OSX too ! - Easy to use and print.- Screenshots on your labelsCons : - Battery for a USB device ? why ? - Defective cartridge included- Cheap plastic feel ... looks like nice aluminum , it 's cheap plastic- Bigger than it needs to be .	-1
This is a great concept , but falls short on execution . I love the idea of typing , viewing , and editing the labels on my computer before printing them on ( expensive ) label tape . I have Epson stand-alone label maker that is great , but the screen is terrible and it is difficult to work all of the formatting options.This should work great . However , aside from a large list of fonts , there are very few formatting options . It does not allow you to print letters high enough to really fill the label - at least not as large as my Epson label maker . The first few labels I printed were unusable , because the print was so spotty - every other letter was printed . There is only one boarder option.The tape itself seems pretty low quality . The adhesive is not very strong and the labels are not waterproof . In contrast , I used my Epson labelmaker to print a name label for my gym water bottle - it has gone through the dishwasher dozens of times without any ill effect . This label did n't even survive a sink washing.The concept is there , but I can not recommend this for anything more than putting labels on file folders.The unit itself is very small - about the size of a hard drive . It does n't require external power and just uses the power from the usb port . There is a internally removable rechargable battery , but I can not understand why the USB power is n't enough . Do some laptops cut off the power to the USB port when the laptop is running on battery power ? NOTE : There might be some added features in a paid upgrade version of the software , but I did n't purchase that to test it .	-1
I feel like an idiot , but my computer is not `` reading '' this device . I 've plugged and unplugged it . I 've plugged it on when it 's on and I 've plugged it in when it 's off . I 've turned the computer off and back on with the device plugged in and with the device unplugged at first and then plugged in , and I 've searched online for drivers ( which do n't exist since it 's PnP ) . Nothing I 've tried worked . I 've contacted techie people for help . I 've changed where I plug it into my computer . I 've verified that all of the input devices I 'm using work ( by testing with other items ) . I 'm not sure what more I can do to make this work on my computer , but as of this time it does not work at all.The other reviews appear to show this as a good product but I 'm unable to verify or form my own opinion since installation is not working for me .	-1
This is a terrific idea for a binder . It 's small , has 3 sturdy binder clips and even has an inside pocket for pens , a calculator , a nail file , etc . It 's a great idea in theory.The problem is that unless I go to an office supply store , there is no common paper size that fits this . I have short legal size notepads at home and without punching holes in the papers , it would n't work.When I tried to use this with the notepads I had , I misaligned the hole punch and had to deal with the messy rough edges from ripping the paper off the pad . It 's too time consuming , in my opinion , to find paper for this binder , punch holes in it and then load it into the binder - particularly when the end effect is it looks messy and disheveled.A more helpful way to market this product would be to have plenty of paper inside the binder , along with a note about what size paper to buy in the future . That would make this binder much more user friendly.I would have given it 5 stars if it was packaged as I described . It would have been very handy for recipes , a dream journal , to take to a meeting or in the car for notes .	-1
For some reason the Vine sent me two of this item but even still , I do n't think there is enough to recommend it.The Avery 5.54 '' by 8.5 : durable write on plastic dividers are an unusual size and schools rarely accept this size paper so I do n't think it 's something students would benefit from.The product also came without any paper and when I called the 800 Avery number that is advertises if you'r stuck or have questions , I asked the customer service person about getting paper for the produce and she did n't seem to know what I was talking about . I would give the service department of Avery a D based on that experience.Inside the cover , it does have a compartment that I would think would be a useful place to store a pocket computer or a cell phone , so either is in easy reach .	-1
this looks like a great little product : a nice , heavy duty binder w/a rear sleeve pocket and a forward , bungee-slipped expandable pocket ... however , you do n't get any pre-punched pages to get you started , and in my case , the binder arrived BROKEN ( the lower pop-rivet that was supposed to anchor the punched rings was loose , allowing the rings to flop uselessly around inside ... now , i 'm trying to think of all the thousands of binders i 've picked up and purchased over the last 40 years , and i do n't think i 've ever seen ONE with that defect ! pity ...	-1
I had really high hopes for the Winsome Alden Lap Desk . Even after seeing some reviews that were less than glowing , I decided to give this lap desk a try . My largest concerns and problems with it have been the build quality and design . The finish of the lap desk , plus the flip up top were two big selling points for me . It 's a shame that the lap desk lacks in quality , because it could have been an awesome product.As someone that often uses a laptop in a chair or bed , I thought I would get some great use out of this . Truth is , I still do use it , but the quality has been lacking . First , it arrived with a minor scratch/ding . Second , it also arrived with a small splint starting the wood . I could have returned it , but it was difficult to find to begin with . Another large disappointment is the fact that all of the edges are sharp and rough . You would think when they designed this they would have realized that you would have your arms and hands resting on it all the time . The sharpness and roughness of the edge can be really irritating . Plus , I hate putting an expensive laptop on a lap desk that could easily scratch it . While the color the finish is a nice color , it could have actually be finished better . it 's not smooth ( although you might not want it too smooth to avoid items sliding off of it ) at all and the feel of it is not appealing.After minimal use , a portion of one of the legs came out . It 's nothing that a little wood glue wo n't fix , but it should n't be happening . The drawer is very loose and opens easily . A simple magnet or anything would have prevented this . It would have also been nice to have the legs lock in place with a simple mechanism . Otherwise , it makes it difficult to move off or on you . The flip top is nice , but again , a simple mechanism would help . You pretty much need to remove your laptop before you can let it back down . Plus , you have to reach under the top itself to release it.Some simple design improvements and finishes could have made this one very nice product . While I do continue to use it , I 'm not as happy with it as I should have been . If and when I see a good replacement , I 'm sure I 'll replace it .	-1
Do you know how frustrating it is to see the answer from 2 calculations ago on the screen but have no way to copy it in your current calculation and thus be forced to type a long number ? Very.The copy and paste does n't work on results.I should n't have to go to memory for this simple task.The manual on the CD does n't address this.I ca n't be the only one who has run into this.Online search did n't help either.Yeah it 's a nice calculator , but if it fails at such a simple thing for me , then it 's worthless ( to me ) .Some good points is that they do n't make you use shift button for common things ( like EXP ) .	-1
The base sticks out way too far if you 're looking to use it on the wall mount . If you 're looking for a wall mount , look elsewhere . Good product otherwise .	-1
My disappointments with this printer started when I realized that it would not work wirelessly , even if I plugged it into the router . They continued when I could n't even get it to work while plugged into my laptop . My old Samsung ML-1740 is still kicking , but this one seems to be a dud . I will accept tips and revise my review if anyone can help me get it running .	-1
Machine failed after less than 2 months and no Amazon protection left . Just great . Do n't waste your money on this dud . I only got about 4000 pages out of it . Not worth wasting your time on this one . Plus the price has doubled since I purchased this . Boo .	-1
Printers are following the `` razor and blades '' business model . They are sold at a very low price . Manufacturers then make up the profit by selling cartridges at a ridiculously high price . In this case , the cartridge is half the price of the printer . All Brother monochrome printers look extremely similar . The flagship model is HL2270DW nowBrother Printer HL2270DW Wireless Monochrome Printer . I suggest that you buy that printer instead . That printer is constantly on sale . It is around one hundred dollars and carried by Amazon if it is on sale . It is significantly cheaper and has more features with the same printing performance . Here is the comparison.Duplex : Both support it.Cartridge : Both use TN450Performance : HL2240D : 24ppm , HL2270DW : 27ppmNetwork support : HL2240D : None , HL2270DW : wired and wirelessPrice as of 12/22/2010 : HL2240D : one hundred and thirty , HL2270DW : less than one hundredNowadays I will not buy a printer without network support . From the above comparison , I really do not see a reason to buy this printer.Update on 4/24/2011 : Amazon no longer carries HL2270DW . It is now only carried by third party vendors , and it is over one hundred dollars . On the other hand , this printer costs only eighty bucks . You may want to rethink it if you do n't need network feature . Or you can always wait to see if the price of HL2270DW will drop .	-1
Bought a Brother HL-2270DW less than 30 days ago . Within 2 days I replaced the starter cartridge with a new TN-420 thinking I would hold the starter cartridge in reserve . In less than 2 or 3 hundred pages the toner light started flashing and the printer refused to print . I did not believe that the cartridge could possibly be out of toner , so I searched the web and found the following instructions to reset the out of toner condition : ===================- Open the front cover and leave open while completing the following steps.- Turn the printer off.- Hold the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) while turning the printer on . All panel lights should be on.- Release the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) .- Press the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) 2 times.- Pause . All panel lights should be on.- Press the 'go ' button ( or `` start ' button ) 5 times.The toner light should be off . ( error may be flashing ) The paper light should be on or flashing.- Close cover . The ready light should be the only light on.====================The printer functioned fine after the reset . I have no idea how long the `` fix '' will last.A pox on companies that build devices like this.====================ONE YEAR LATER April 16 , 2013So I have had this printer for one year now and I must say , that except for the above problem , it has functioned flawlessly . In retrospect it has proved to be very cost effective and efficient .	-1
This was easy to set up . The suction cup does n't really stick on very well , but I suppose that is part of the design , so that it can be moved easily . I find that you have to hold the container with one hand while pulling the tape piece out with the other . Not particularly convenient .	-1
If only this worked as it 's supposed to . It 's hard to place the tape in the dispenser as well as to pull what you need . I would not recommend this product as a tradional dispenser can do the job for less money and hassle .	-1
Oh , it works fine , as advertised , but I just ca n't see a need for this . Plus , cost-wise , it is n't an economical way to use such tape . So , just another needless gadget to clutter up one 's life , in my opinion .	-1
When this arrived , I thought it would be the perfect thing to keep in my craft area for when I 'm wrapping gifts AND to keep it so my kids do n't tear off more than they need . Each piece of tape is the same size and pre-cut . They sort of pop-up like facial tissue.However , nothing I tried ( short of glue ) kept the dispenser stuck to the surface . I tried glass , laminate , marble , plastic and porcelain to see if I could get it to get enough suction to stay . It might stick for a second , but then when you go to pull off another piece , it pops right off.If you wanted , you could glue this down , but why bother ? Just `` stick '' with the regular tape dispensers for now , this one needs a design overhaul .	-1
I can imagine a committee of marketing guys struggling all night to come up with something new . Finally they invent the Pop-Up tape dispenser and go home but they have wasted their time.Its only advantage is that the strips of tape are pre-cut , the idea is that you pull out the next one from the cartridge and whack it on . But the dispenser did not work for me . When I pulled the first tape out , nothing came out of the slot to replace it . And trying to fix this was a pain . I gave up in disgust.My advice : stay with the old style spools of tape .	-1
When I bought this chair I did so because it was advertised as `` Leather '' . I 've been buying leather furniture for over 30 years -I 'm not an expert and when the chair arrived I thought the leather was fine.A comment left on this review made me raise an eyebrow and take a closer look . Joining me was a long time friend who spent his career with Natuzzi leather . It 's absolutely NOT leather . Research on the Net confirms that fake leather has become so hard to distinguish from real that the majority of even knowledgeable consumers ca n't tell the difference . Here 's a quote from ehow dot com . `` There is nothing more infuriating then paying big bucks for leather furniture or clothing and realizing you have been duped when it is too late . There is a real racket for faux leather and sometimes you ca n't tell for sure what you are paying for . `` ehow.comI contacted the seller who in turn contacted the manufacturer and I was told it was Bonded Leather . Bonded leather is made from ground up scraps of leather , mixed with a polymer and pressed in a mold to make the grain . It does n't perform , breath , last or age like leather because it is n't leather . There 's nothing wrong with advertising a piece of furniture as `` Bonded Leather '' it can look great and costs a fraction of a simmilar item made of real leather . However it 's deceiving to advertise this chair as leather . `` Soft Touch '' leather is what we in Advertising call `` weasel words '' . They 're marketing phrases and they 're meaningless . You want to see `` 100 % Leather '' `` Genuine Leather '' or the nature of the Hide such as `` Lamb Skin '' printed on the label.No label ? it 's not leather.The Mechanism.The height adjustment lever is easy to use and silent . To adjust the back a lever would have been a nice touch and they 're certainly more convenient to use . Instead there 's a tension knob under the seat which you have to turn to adjust how far the back will lean and how much give it will have . So expect to get in and out of the chair multiple times to get the sitting position you want.AssemblyOver the past 30 years , I must have assembled a dozen of these . They 're never effortless . The chair comes with clear directions and a small Allen Wrench , grab a Phillips head screwdriver and you 're good to go . Expect to spend around an hour putting it together - leave final tightening of all screws until you 're finished.Because so many of the screws are driven into plastic be careful not to over tighten and avoid using an electric drill with a Phillips bit or electric screwdriver as I have no doubt you 'll strip the threads.Build Quality.Not very sturdy - there is movement and give where you would rather it be sound and solid . But it 's far from terrible and pretty much a non issue.The Bottom Line.If this was a leather chair it would be a sensational value . For a Fake leather chair this is anything but . Comparable chairs sell both on and off Amazon for around $ 79 - $ 129.The selling of this chair is an example of `` Bait and Switch '' I wo n't accept that - not on any level . I 'll be returning the chair .	-1
When I got this shredder I thought it was going to be cool . A Monster that will eat all that is thrown at it . No more waiting and feeding and waiting and feeding . The real world is different and it hits home with this shredder . It will shred perfect sheets 8 and half by 11 and nothing else . I have Swingline Personal Cross-cut Shredder with 12 Sheet Capacity , 1757390 ( EX12-05 ) and love it . That one you can put in like 15 sheets . This one wont do five . It is soooo weak . If you have perfect pages placed carefully in the thing it will eat them sloooooowly . It jammed several times for me . It has rollers that fold each sheet in half then feeds it . Did i mention slowly . Tried different sized sheets and it immediatly jammed . Should have been named the Swingline Jammer . I can also see if it did work that the rollers would wear and would not be working long . Avoid this one.As always if you have any questions just ask me .	-1
This thing is a gimmick . It does shred paper , but only if you do it *just* right . It 's not nearly as useful as the description sounds , and frankly , does n't even work as it should most of the time . If you 've got so much to shred that you ca n't feed a bit of paper at a time to the shredder , I 'd suggest investing in a very good , heavy duty standard shredder and spending the extra 30 seconds.Pros : - It does have capacity for 60 pages . It 's a neat concept , and it will hold garbage paper.- See through bin . Good feature so I know when it 's filling up.Cons : - Poor shredding performance . From constant sticks to jams and everything in between , this performed worse than the most discount models I 've tried elsewhere.- The auto feature just does n't work . It wo n't pull in the paper , it does n't get it all , and it 's just a disaster.- All the shreds pile into the middle of the collector , so you must shake it to disperse them and get it to work again.- Anything beyond one sheet at a time , neatly stacked - and it jams . The auto-feed feature does n't work with multiple pages , staples , or anything of the sort .	-1
If you really hate shredding paper , this is a great product for either personal or small business use . The key benefit is convenience . [ Good ] Fire and Forget : I really love this shredder 's main feature of just leaving paper to be shredded inside of the machine and just leaving it to do its business . This is a nice innovation for people with little time . It helps me shred everything sensitive instead of just being lazy and just throwing it into the garbage.UPDATE : The main feature of this product , hands free shredding , will stop working normally after a few months of use . The hands free feature will either jam or simply just not pull any papers into the shredder . At best this is just a large capacity normal shredder . ( NO LONGER FULLY RELEVANT ) It Works : Assuming that you follow the instructions and you do n't have a defective model , this thing does n't jam . I 've seen the reviews mentioning that this shredder has issues with shredding a lot less than 15 pages and paper jams . Because of those reviews , I 've held back my review for fear that it wo n't hold up with time . Surprisingly , I have not experienced any of the issues mentioned in those reviews . I am aware of the machine 's limitations and for every shredding session I have counted all the papers that I shred at a time ensuring that they do not go over the 60 page limit . I also used to empty out the shredder after every shredding session . How did I get around not having to manually empty it after every session ? I stopped using the plastic bin and I placed the shredder on a table with a tall garbage can below it . Then with some cardboard and duct tape , I constructed a 'ramp ' , placing it where the plastic bin originally resided , that directs the shredded paper to a tall trash can below the shredder . If Swingline was smart , they would create and sell a plastic version of this ramp . If I have time in the near future , I may replace this review with a video version to demonstrate this product along with my duct tape cardboard ramp . [ Bad ] Price : Nothing is free . You 're going to have to pay a price for that nice time saving innovation . When it was double the current price ( about 4x the cost of a normal shredder ) , I would be a little hesitant in purchasing this shredder . However at the current price ( which is about 2x the cost of a normal shredder ) , I feel that it 's fair deal for the time you save.Not Pro : I do n't feel that this is for anything beyond personal or ( very ) small business use . I think most businesses will want something that goes beyond this product 's capacity.Weird product position : For people like me it 's perfect . However either the price or durability do not really meet a large segment of consumers . It 's either too expensive for most people , or for most of the people willing to pay the price ; it 's not durable enough for the amount . Maybe the 2nd or 3rd generation of this product line will be more promising once they improve quality control . [ Misc ] I tend to only use this shredder once a day approx 2-5 times a week , though I average about 50 pages per shredding session . Most of the items I 've shredded were flat legal papers , though occasionally I 'd mix in folded finance statements and credit card offers . I 'm also pretty good about maintenance , which involves putting some oil on the papers that you 're shredding from time to time .	-1
I think this shredder was designed for people who have a nice neat stack of papers that have never been folded . My bag of papers were definitely not that ! The legal size has to be fed manually and ca n't be put in the `` walk away '' stack which would be fine if the shredder was n't so fussy . It worked really well for about the first 1/4 of the stack then started stopping and needing readjustment all the time . It would n't allow any but the very thin gauge paper anything else would cause it to stop . Same thing for a couple of papers stapled together . Same thing for any paper that was n't the right length and on and on . For a lesser priced shredder I could have tolerated this.. it did still make the job easier and had moments when it worked really well ... but not enough that I could really trust it to keep on shredding and walk away . And for the price that is unacceptable . Does n't earn it 's money in the office .	-1
60x sheets shredded at a time sounds impressive . And it would be if actually worked . However , the shredder I received shreds no more than 10-15 sheets at a time . The 60x refers to the capacity of the auto-feed drawer . You can put 60 sheets in there and they will get shredded ( providing the machine does n't jam ; more on that later ) , but not simultaneously.The auto feeder works awesome if you have flat , unfolded sheets of paper free of staples , tape , or thick envelopes . It becomes nearly useless for my main purpose : shredding the insane number of credit card offers , Discover checks , and other junk mail that I receive . To successfully shred these items each and every one must be opened , flattened , and placed carefully in the auto feeder . If the shredder gets through half without jamming up , you 're very lucky . Designed to save you time , I 've found it takes MORE Of my time to use this shredder than a standard design . Frustrating.Another issue : the shredder is huge . 20-25 % larger than an equivalently powered top-down shredder . Too large for my taste given the fact it does n't do that great a job shredding junk mail.For stuff like computer print outs without creases or folds , the shredder works fantastic . If you 're an accountant or tax preparer or someone else printing and shredding a lot of unfolded paper , this unit will work well . Otherwise , I 'd recommend a standard , top mounted shredder .	-1
This machine does shred paper , which is the only reason I 'm giving it two stars rather than one . It 's so frustrating to use that I 'd really rather just build a bonfire to destroy important papers.This shredder jams constantly , and you often wo n't even know there 's a jam . You have to lift the lid and press reverse and hope whatever 's stuck in there will come out . If a piece of paper has even the slightest irregularity , or is too thick or too thin , the machine will either jam up or simply not accept the piece of paper.The stack-and-shred feature is useless . There are rollers that are supposed to take a sheet from the bottom of the stack , fold it in half , and then feed it through the shredder . Every couple of sheets , something goes wrong , and the rollers just run without catching any paper . So you 're stuck with putting your papers in through the top , one at a time , and fighting the endless paper jams.I have an Amazon Basics Strip-Cut Shredder that was selling for about 30 dollars at the time I got it . With the Amazon Basics shredder , I can shred up to eight sheets at a time , and it has never once jammed up on me . It 's also faster and more powerful than this one . The only drawback is that it cuts the papers into strips rather than actually shredding them , but I 'd still recommend it over this Swingline shredder . Either that or build a bonfire .	-1
I have a large family and thus receive an enormous amount of mail . Since much of it contains personally identifiable information , it must be disposed securely . Shredding is a job I generally put off as long as possible , so I often find myself with a huge box of stuff to shred . I had recently purchased an inexpensive , over-the-trashcan style crosscut shredder which performed very well . It was the endless trips to empty the trashcan , as well as finding the bits of stray shreds all over the house for weeks that I found tedious . So when I was given the opportunity to review a shredder that would eliminate the tedious stuff , I was thrilled ! The Stack-and-Shred is fairly large - it will take up some space on a desk or table top . However , you will lose much of the convenience factor if you place it on the floor so make sure you have space for it . ( 16.5 '' x 11.3 '' x 14.2 '' ) . The shredder itself seems acceptably sturdy , but the pull-out drawer/waste bin is flimsy . In fact , mine arrived with a corner of the plastic broken in shipping . It does n't affect the functionality , but if it were to break to the point of being non-functional , the shredder would be useless unless I got a replacement from Swingline . There is a safety feature that locks out the shredder until the bin is firmly in place.It has a unique design . There is a flip up , top cover that works two ways . Closed , you can shred conventionally through the slot in the lid . You must use the top slot for credit cards , card stock , and stapled sheets . Open the lid , and you can lay flat sheets of paper in the shredding area - up to 60 according to Swingline . Close the lid and the shredder grabs the paper , one sheet at a time with two rubberized rollers , and feeds it into the shredder . The shredded material falls into the 4 gallon waste bin/drawer , which you pull out to empty.It is a cross-cut shredder and the shredded material is well cut , with no chunks of readable , uncut material except when the machine jams.Here are the not so good aspects of this shredder:1 . I was never able to shred a single credit card . It jammed every time.2 . Paper must be quite flat to use the automatic shredder capability and even then , I experienced multiple jams.3 . The shredded material falls down toward the back of the waste bin/drawer so even though it is clear , you can not see when the shredded stuff has clumped up to the point of causing a jam . So you must regularly pull the drawer out and redistribute the material in the drawer . You have to do this with other shredders , too , but you can usually see the shredded stuff more easily to judge when it 's time.4 . The biggest problem is that the shredder will run for somewhere up to 2 minutes before overheating and shutting down . The cool down period seemed like forever - sometimes up to an hour . That is a big problem for me because even when I am shredding weekly , I have way more paper than I can shred in 2 minutes.I really wanted to like this shredder and perhaps for people who only shred 10-20 pages on a daily basis , it would work OK . It does not work well for my needs .	-1
Dear Stapler , You fit so snugly in the palm of my hand . You were such a quirky rebel , refusing to unhinge and staple straight and storing your staples in a slider -- upside down . You were nothing like the staplers I 've known before.And then the cranky lady from room 507 came to the desk to check out . I stapled her folio to her registration card and you gave such a satisfying , violent-tinged snap . I smiled as I handed over her copy of the folio , congratulating myself on not stapling her lips to her eyelids . Without you , most beloved of staplers , that transaction might have gone so wrong.And then you turned on me . Your slider would pop out with no warning , spilling your staples to the floor . Then when I asked you to staple more than 9 sheets of paper , you failed me altogether . I ca n't accept such frivolity , stapler , such poor workmanship . I 'm afraid now I must return to the staid staplers of my youth .	-1
I 'm using this stapler to replace a traditional Swingline 747 Stapler that vanished from my office desk a few months ago . I really believed that a metal stapler was the best kind of stapler to to survive use and abuse , but was willing to give a smaller , lighter stapler a chance for my precious desk real estate . The PaperPro Evo Compact works well and with minimal effort that is indeed much like a Staple Gun in how rapidly it staples paper . Its size too makes it portable , so it would be an option for someone who needs a portable stapler , but does n't want to use one of those cute , but useless-because-mini-staples-are-so-hard-to-find-mini-staplers.Update : I tried taking this stapler with me in my messenger bag and found that just a short trip from apartment to car , car to office , rendered it unusable . Nothing happens now when I try to staple . I have plenty of staples in it and other than the bottom that slides out to add staples , there is no way to take it apart to see what is wrong . I do n't recommend this stapler .	-1
I did n't like this tape gun at all . The tape roll when placed on the dispenser is way up there , higher than my other tape gun . I like to use my thumb to hold the tape to give it tension when sealing boxes and the roll is so high that my thumb can not reach it . If you have small hands you might want a smaller , less heavy one .	-1
it was a lot less expensive than the Canon brand but it only worked for a few copies than it stopped making copies .	-1
I was not impressed with the quality of the ink . In spite of following the directions , the printed pages were poorly printed . Next time I will buy Canon cartridges .	-1
I followed the instruction the ink came with but the printer was reading low ink . The computer did not recognize the ink either so I had to return the ink and by Canon ink .	-1
I really wanted to like this stapler . I hold staplers when using them most of the time , so this model , being ergonomically designed to fit in your hand , made a lot of sense . But from the moment I first got it , I hated it.I did n't want to look at the instructions because I wanted to see if I could figure out how to load it without the instructions ( because who holds onto STAPLER instructions , right ? ) . I tried pulling up on the top , as you do with almost all other manual staplers , but that did n't work . Then I spotted a door at the back with an arrow . Aha ! They must slide in from the back . I tried lifting the the door at the bottom , where the arrow was pointing , but it would n't budge . I tried sliding it downwards , as the arrow was surely directing me to do , but it did n't want to move . Then I realized that the `` door '' was actually a button , and when I pushed it , the front of the stapler shot out . Since when does an arrow mean to push ON the arrow ? It seems that having it discreetly printed `` Push to Open '' would make a lot more sense , or if they really feel that strongly about making it usable for non-English-speakers , a picture of a finger pushing would have been second best . But a downwards-pointing arrow ? ? Loading bar open , I tried to put in a full strip of staples . It was really difficult getting it on the loading bar ; there was just barely enough room . But when I tried to close the stapler , the bar would n't move . Frustrated , I removed the staples , closed the loading bar , and brought it to my husband to see if he could figure it out.He did the same thing that I did , trying to pull it apart like a conventional stapler . When that did n't work , he turned it around and around in his hands before spotting the arrow . He tried pulling . He tried sliding . Then he pushed , and the bar shot out . `` Here , '' he said smugly . I handed him the staples and told him to try loading them . He tried and tried , and finally announced that a whole strip would n't fit ; I 'd have to break it in two.Then I looked for the directions . There were none . You 're on your own.I tried it some more myself , and eventually several staples ended up breaking off . THEN the bar was able to close . I know this was n't just an issue I had ... several other reviewers have mentioned that not quite all the staples will fit . You 'll have to treat this like a mini stapler and break the strips in half , or just break off about 10 of them and throw them away each time you load . This is an astoundingly bad design flaw . What was the manufacturer thinking ? But how does it work ? Well , it staples okay . Nothing special . It was , as promised , easy to compress , and for that , I give it two stars ( otherwise , I wanted to just give it one ) . And the shape is n't all that ergonomic . I mean if you 're going to design this specifically for hand usage , why not make it have finger holds or something to make it easier to grip ? It 's okay if you 're only doing a few staples , but if you will be doing a big project requiring you to staple over and over again , I 'd get something else . I just ca n't recommend this stapler .	-1
Update : I had previously given this a five star review , but after two months the stapler jammed shut and would not open , no matter what I did . It had jammed a number of times previously but could always be opened . I loved using this stapler , but breaking so quickly makes me drop my rating a ton.Staplers are n't supposed to be noticed . They are just supposed to be available when you want them , not break , and put staples through papers . I must say that every time I 've used this stapler since I got it to review over a month ago , I take notice.The Swingline SmartTouch is a joy to use . With light two-finger pressure , it punches a staple consistently through small stacks of paper . I have n't had to have a single re-staple . I have n't had to put any thought to stapling ; I just put the paper in , push the top , and the stapler seems to staple itself . Refilling the stapler is easy , and I have n't had any problems with that either.It 's probably because I have only had super cheap , old-fashioned staplers my whole life , but I love this . And at the price that it is currently selling for ( just under ten bucks ) , no brainer if you need to replace or purchase a stapler .	-1
There are no instructions included which makes getting started more difficult . The first problem is loading the staples . A little flag shows to push on the back end to load staples . I succeeded in pushing the knob too hard and it came off . After I made a few more attempts , I took it to a professional , an administrative assistant . She knew what to do but also found it hard to get this opener button to work . She pushed the flagged button and somehow the front staple area opened up . We were both surprised ! In an attempt to load staples , she found a entire row ( as staples come packaged ) would not fit . She broke the strip in half and was able to slide the staples in . She picked up a small stack of papers and gave it a go . She said it was easy to work.Relieved , I returned to my office . When I tried to test it on a stack of about 10 papers , it did not staple and the staple area came open again . I threw it in my desk drawer . Trying it again will wait for another day . So far , not so good .	-1
First off I will admit that the stapler does live up to it 's claim and does n't require much effort in order to staple even when doing 25 pages . So it is nice in that respect . Unfortunately it also does n't take much effort to open the loading tray either . It opens at the merest touch and it is constantly needing to be closed again . Not a huge thing I guess , but it becomes extremely annoying when it 's needing to be closed with every other staple . Pulling the staple tray out in order to load it does require more than a bit of effort . It does not slide smoothly at all and oftentimes gets stuck in the process . Perhaps this will loosen up with usage ... perhaps not . I also do n't like the fact that it ca n't be opened up to staple things up on walls , etc . As someone who works in a school this is a necessity .	-1
I needed a stapler for my new bridge club . I figured , & # 34 ; It 's a stapler , what could be wrong ? & # 34 ; Unfortunately it is both awkward to hold , load , and open . I was not impressed . Normally Swingline makes really good stuff , but I will not be using this one .	-1
Not happy with this at all . It does not easily staple 25 sheets , in fact , anything over 5 or 6 and the head jams . I do n't like that you can only load half a sleeve of staples inside , this is a time waster when you 've got a large job to do . Working with a classroom , I tend to sort and staple lots of papers , but this wo n't handle the work . It sits nicely on the desk , but requires two hands to staple in order to prevent it from tipping over as it is very thinly designed yet top heavy . I give it two stars only because it & # 34 ; looks & # 34 ; nice and handles a skinny stack of papers decently . Sorry , Swingline , you missed the target with this one .	-1
I 'm updating this review months later and downgrading the star rating . It 's been my auxiliary stapler but soon will be sidelined completely . The last few times I 've refilled staples , the mechanism has not worked properly . It sticks going in -- and out . Moreover , the thing pops open at the least provocation . The more I look at this thing , the more I see how badly it is designed. -- -- My current desk stapler is at least 35 years old . It 's just a standard metal stapler . But , with one exception , I find much to commend it over this Swingline SmartTouch.My current stapler:1. is smaller and more compact ; the Swingline is 2 inches longer and 2 inches higher.2 . sits solidly on my desk ; the Swingline is less stable ( but more comfortable if you 're squeezing with your hand ) and therefore a bit cumbersome . It does n't sit upright reliably , toppling over with the least provocation , so I rest it on its side . That means I must examine it each time I use it , to make sure I 'm inserting the papers at the right end.3 . is metal-colored ; the Swingline is a dulle3d Pepto-Bismol pink , easy to find on a cluttered desk but not my favorite color.4 . does n't spit out the staple-loading portion at the least provocation.The Swingline 's one advantage for me : It easily staples 25 sheets . My old stapler poops out about halfway through 15 sheets , even if I use the heel of my hand to press down with a good degree of force.Because I rarely staple together more than a few sheets , though , I do n't anticipate the Swingline replacing Old Faithful .	-1
On the plus side : + Cute , takes up less space on desk+ Takes less effort to staple+ Nice rubbery gripsMinuses : - A little tougher to load and it only take half a row of staples- Jams too easily with any kind of a sizable stack of paper- `` To Load Staples Press Here '' sign got stuck in removal ; had to pull out the rest with tweezers- Popped open a couple of times when I squeezed it the wrong wayI 'll stick with my trustyRapid 90119 K1 Classic Pliers . Clunky and reliable . The Rapid is easy to load and goes through a large stack .	-1
This stapler has a nice action and is a great compact size for storing in a drawer . Good for children learning to control a stapler , like my 5yo who enjoys making his own little books right now . Unfortunately ours broke within 2 days and wo n't staple any longer .	-1
I love the color , I love the feel , I love the weight , I love the way it sits on my desk without taking up much space . I love how easy it is to staple.I hate the fact that 1 out of 3 times I use it , it jams . I should n't have to get pliers out the first time I use a brand new stapler to remove the bent up staples.I also should n't be trying to figure out how to get the grey accents to stay on after one week of casual use.I do n't make massive packets to staple , in fact I hardly staple at all any more ... but when I need to staple something - I want to staple it and be done with it . I do n't want to be prying staples out of my stapler and then looking for superglue to get the padding to stay on it.As much as I want to love this stapler - I just ca n't . I ca n't recommend it either unless you are just looking for a stapler shaped paperweight .	-1
This seems like a nice stapler at first but it 's prone to jamming and you have to really disassemble it to fix the jam . Check the reviews at Staples.com	-1
I received this product for free to review from the Amazon Vine program . I ordered the stapler because our kids were always taking my stapler from my office for their school assignments and not putting mine back . I thought with bright pink it would be easy to find my stapler wherever it ended up in the house . That part worked . With its bright pink color is is easy to track down.However , I think I prefer my old standard black stapler with the flat bottom . While I give the Swingline R+D department an A for effort to try to find a new look for an old classic product , this really does n't work that well . The bottom has a curved design which makes it less stable on desk tops , and easy to fall over . It was confusing at first to figure out how to load the staples , because the holder pulls out horizontally instead of the top swinging up like on most other staplers I have owned . On top of that I have had more than a few staple jams with this stapler , so for me I think I will stick to a boring looking but more functional desk top stapler .	-1
When I read the product description for these highlighters I was excited . I was sorely disappointed to find out that these are just glorified blunt translucent crayons . Indeed they will not dry out , and you can extend the tip by turning the knob . And it wo n't bleed through the paper , but I had a difficult time drawing a straight line due to the size of the tip .	-1
This highlighter feels weird and when you hit the tip on something it tears or gets a cut because the tip is gel . As for it 's highlighting ability , it works like a crayon ; it does n't bleed through paper yet highlights well . I do n't know if I would actually purchase this item though . Something about it does n't sem quite right.Update : I rarely use this highlighter ; they mark over the writing like a crayon . I like regular highlighters better . Like someone else said though , you can leave the stop off these types of highlighters and they will not dry out .	-1
These envelopes are actually quite pretty in person with raised , embossed details and bright , vibrant colors . The problem is that I was expecting six patterned envelops and there are in fact only three You get three plain white ones too , but those are meant to be used out outer envelopes for the three patterned ones . So even though it says six , you really can only send three.The other problem is that they are very thin . I tried a few different items to get an idea and could n't fit a small shirt into the largest envelope . Books fit fine , as long as they were n't really thick hardcovers.Personally , I 'm going to use the three patterned envelopes as stocking stuffer packages at home , and the three plain white envelopes to mail out books to friends. $ 12.99 for 3 too-thin patterned mailers and 3 plain ones is WAY TOO MUCH . I wo n't be buying any more of these .	-1
I was drawn to the convenience of this product but dissapointed upon seeing them in person . First off , the decorative envelope is not so nice looking..very computer generated , blah designs ! They are the exact weight and feel of the outer white envelopes which makes them seem doubley wasteful . Why not just stick a mailing label on the decorative one and mail it ? ! ? For the price of these 3 mailers you really should do that and get 6 out of them ! Save your money and buy the holiday ones offered at your post office , those are at least cute !	-1
I should have read the description more closely ; I did n't realize that you had to put the decorative envelope in a bigger , white envelope . I thought these were like the decorative mailing envelopes that I 've seen elsewhere . I really do n't see the point in putting an envelope inside of another envelope & possibly costing more to ship than if I just used one mailer.I realize the increase in postage most likely would n't be that much , but it seems like a waste when you can just buy a holiday mailer . Also , I prefer water-resistant bubble mailers ... these would n't last long on a doorstop in rain or snow.P.S . `` Pack of 6 '' is misleading , as they are including the plain envelopes in the total .	-1
This shredder worked well for 5 months and then it failed completely and this was with very light and infrequent use . Usually a shredder will last us 24 months or longer.It will cost us $ 20 to ship it to Swingline for repairs and no telling how long it will last .	-1
I 'll agree the ink itself is exceptionally smooth , but there seems to be a problem with the ball bearing tip.Perhaps it 's due to the extreme angle at which I tend to hold my pen and the rhythm of my stroke , but these pens simply made a mess when I tried to write with them . The ink is `` slippery '' and actually globbed in puddles as I wrote ; the output was equally bad , whether writing in cursive or printing in block letters.Judging from the many other positive reviews here , I suspect it could be the shallowness of my writing angle . Perhaps , if you hold your pen upright , this would not be an issue . But for my writing style , these are a no-go -- the finished notes are sloppy and unusable . No point in writing what you ca n't read later !	-1
Smooth indeed . Unfortunately , the ink began to glob on the paper and on the tip after writing very little with these . Bad enough that it reminded me of the old school Papermate pens that wrote beautifully only to be disappointed in the globby mess you were left with in the end .	-1
I was excited to try this `` smooth writer '' pen , but as soon as I began writing , I got pen splotches . It is comfortably padded and nice looking , but was not , as advertised , `` the best pen you 'll ever use '' .	-1
I 've been using these pens for a few weeks now.Pros : - Grip provides nice comfort.- Writes smoothly . It 's easy to write in cursive if you do so.Cons : - When you write in non-cursive , the color is inconsistent . Some letters appear heavier than others.- The ink does not dry quickly and smears quickly . If you are a fast writer , it will leave ink stains on your hands.Due to these issues , I would look at other options .	-1
I really want to like these pens because they 're comfortable to hold and write very smoothly , but the nib easily gets congested with ink and I ca n't write for very long without getting inky blotches on the page . They 're frustrating ! I wo n't be buying any more of these .	-1
This pen may be the `` smoothest pen in the universe '' because the ink comes out like it is made of oil . It oozes , clumps , blots and smears . It creates a mess . It 's the kind of pen that you find , thinking someone has lost it until you write with it and discover that they just did n't bother to pick it up.I like most pens . I like Bic pens . I do not like this pen .	-1
I 've been looking for a good pen . I write a lot and a good pen makes it a pleasure . Unfortunately , this is not the pen.On the positive side , the pen feels good in you hand , the rubber grip is comfortable and the balance is good.On the negative side , although the pen glides smoothly , it also causes the ink to cake on the tip . I hate writing with a Kleenex or other other paper to wipe the tip to keep the ink from making splotches on the paper.I really wanted to like this pen , but unfortunately , it did n't give me what I want in an expensive writing pen .	-1
I do n't know if I got a bad batch since other reviews are generally positive , but these pens were blotchy and left streaks . I am only giving them two stars because they are comfortable to hold . However , based on how well they wrote I have to give them very low marks . They pens I got actually left little strings of ink that would then smear when I brushed my hand over it .	-1
All my life , as a writer , I 've been particularly picky about the pens I use . Let that be a warning to you as I continue this review.Frankly , these pens sounded awful good , and I 'm wondering why on earth we ca n't , by now , make astonishingly good pens , in the two dollar range . These BIC 's are n't it ! The ink is n't stable on the page , so sometimes it becomes lighter , sometimes darker.That 's a big no-no for me.The rubber grip was too far back for my smaller woman 's hand , so my forefinger rested beyond it near the tip which was made of hard plastic and became irksome after awhile . This would also apply to a child 's hands . I got to thinking this was a pen engineered by men for men.The vaunted smoothness did n't make it , either . The tip of the pen made writing with it feel like you were using a pestle made of marble . Surely there is a way to get the pen tip to roll smoothly along with the ink . Usually , you have to choose one or the other.The plastic clips on the end of the pen which hold it in your pocket , sprung at first use . But the clicker was reliable . I ended up giving the pens away .	-1
Part of having a pen is that , you know , the ink flows so it can write . Every time , till the ink is gone . The BIC `` Velocity '' ( must be ironic , that name ) Gel pen fails miserably on this requirement . I do n't know if the tip gets clogged , or what , but these pens have never worked properly even new out of the box , and i end up nearly scratching thru the paper with illegible `` start and stop '' writing . Very frustrating , considering they clearly have ink in them Worst Pen Ever . I had a whole box of these turkeys , which went straight into the garbage . ( and Yes , i did remove the plastic tip ... maybe that 's the problem - that whatever they 're using is somehow still clogging the ink flow ... .sounds like you need to go back to the lab , Bic Boys . )	-1
This is ALL about packaging . Honestly , it 's kinda silly , a blatant attempt to bilk more money out of folks for the same product they 've always been making . What 's different ? The cheap , plastic barrel of the pen is a different color , but the ink part I believe is IDENTICAL to your cheaper basic bic pen . The barrel is the same , octagon shape as their other pens . And , since the barrel is transparent , all you really see is the black ink part , so the color is really not that significant . Perhaps the barrel is slimmer , but for me , it did not make it any more comfortable ( and I have small hands ) . My suggestion is either go with the cheaper pen , or step up to a more comfortable soft grip . This pen is not the solution for me .	-1
These are `` for her '' because no guy could hold on to these things . These pens are pretty - remind me of light sabers - BUT oh boy , I do n't know what to do with them because there are very uncomfortable to use and I do n't have large hands ! I guess I will have to find some children to give them to but I hesitate giving small kids ink ! My hand is aching trying to grip it just writing out a check . Give me instead a nicely rounded pen with a rubber grip . I know it 's probably my age and my hands getting arthritic but I would not recommend these to anyone unless you already know you can write with something that feels like a pencil stub.I give it two stars for the colors , very pretty .	-1
My girlfriend said these are not only the LEAST absorbent product she 's ever used , she said the thin barrel provides NO protection against heavy flow and does n't fit the contours of her body ! She 's going to stick with traditional products and leave these pens where they belong : in the trash !	-1
I will admit that when I saw 'for her ' on the packaging I was a bit skeptical . Often products made this way seem to just be using marketing lingo and do n't seem to have actually done anything that make their product more user friendly to women . I found the design of these way too skinny and the hard plastic not at all comfortable to hold . Worst of all , these pens seem to stop working even though there is clearly more ink left . It leads to a lot of wasted pens and frustrating . I do n't recommend these .	-1
I am using these at my job where I have to do a lot of writing . I prefer a large barrel as it lessens hand discomfort . I have used BIC pens in the past so thought I would give these a try.The barrel is rather slim , much slimmer than the BIC pens from the old days . The ink comes out easily you do n't have to press down hard to write . It produces a fine print and does n't smear . Although the package has different color pens on the outside they are all black ink . After using the pen for 1/4 of a day about 1/10 of the ink has already been used . For the amount of writing I do these pens would not be cost effective for me to use . I found the slimness of the barrel uncomfortable after a short while once again due to the amount of writing I had to do.Losing the cap of the pen would be an issue if you want to carry a pen in your pocket . I will stay with the large barrel pens .	-1
I was excited to try BIC Cristal for Her Pens . They are really quite lovely . But they were n't as absorbent as I had been expecting . Still , they are pretty and since I have a uterus function is immaterial .	-1
Be still my fragile , feminine fingers - BIC has created a pen just for women ... huh ? Women 's pens ? Yes , it appears even pens need to be gendered these days . Sure , there are plenty of products that are better when designed specifically for women . Life vests come to mind as I 'm now taking sailing lessons - they do n't fit people with breasts ! But pens ? Are women 's hands really so small and frail that they need a thinner pen ? I beg to differ , but then again I 'm a pianist so maybe my hands developed into gargantuan man-hands due to years of practice . Nice uber-stereotypical touch to make the pens pink , and pastel green and blue . The pens actually felt quite noticeably thinner to me , which felt off . Maybe they would be great for children ? Infantilization of women anyone ?	-1
These BIC pens `` feature a thin barrel designed to fit a women 's hand '' , which apparently is deemed to be much smaller than mine . My hands fit into women 's medium gloves , and are not `` man hands '' .Because these are low-end BIC pens , without even the rubberized barrel of the Clic Stic pens which cost $ 4 . or less for a dozen , they are hard for me to hold on to.If a manufacturer wants to `` shrink and pink '' ballpoints in the hope of appealing to women , I would purchase those in pastel colors which are perhaps shorter and therefore easier to fit in a small purse pocket , but these pens are , functionally , more suited for a child than for an adult woman.They do write smoothly and well , and if you have especially small hands they may be the pens for you .	-1
This whole BIC for her thing is a bit of a gimmick if you ask me . Since when ca n't women use the same pen as everyone else . Maybe my daughters , who in this computer age , write FAR less than I did/do , might fall for this slimmer pen , pastel color thing , but I actually found these pens to be somewhat flimsy and I did NOT like the slimmer profile that is supposed to be specifically for women . Unless you are given these free as a prize or a gift , I would not bother purchasing these pens .	-1
Wow , I ca n't believe BiC can get away with making such a ridiculous product . I wish there was a & # 34 ; remove this item & # 34 ; from Amazon button . Sham on you BiC , this is not 1956 .	-1
There is nothing special about these pens . They are regular , cheap Bic pens that come in pastel colors that supposedly appeal to women . The pen also seems skinnier than regular Bic pens , and I am not sure why that is supposed to appeal to women or to men for that matter , because I think the pens are kind of uncomfortable to hold . I prefer the slightly thicker pens personally . Do n't waste the extra money on these .	-1
I have small hands ... my 11 year old nephew has bigger hands then I do if that gives you some idea . I have never thought my hands were so small that I needed a special pen . I was curious as to what a pen made for `` her '' would be like . Would they be curved to fit a woman ? Strong enough for a man but made for a woman ? ? Nope . They were ordinary ball pens except super thin . I am left handed and I hold pens in a weird way that puts a lot of pressure on the body of the pen . These pens were so thin they felt really flimsy and I worried that I might put too much pressure on it that they would break . I just did n't like how thin and weird they felt and really do n't see a need for them . I will stick with regular sized pens .	-1
Horrible pencil sharpener , does n't work , all it does is break off the tips . You get what you pay for . Terrible .	-1
I bought this for my kids , my daughter has homework and needs pencils , so I did n't at the time have the money to pay 30 dollars for a built in sharpener . When this was delivered I was disappointed right then . This is like 3 pieces , the sharpener , is inside the black piece and somehow it fell out and I could n't get it back in , no idea how it worked . Which was okay , for a short time I was able to hold the tiny left over piece until that went missing because it was so small.. I wo n't be buying one of these again , and I do n't recommend..	-1
I am very picky about my staplers and I hate this one . It is very cheap feeling -- lightweight plastic and has an annoying rebound after each staple . I recommend you look at this stapler instead : Swingline LightTouch Compact Reduced Effort Stapler ( 66412 )	-1
First off , I 'm using this for home use , so it 's mostly for keeping papers together , kids homework , art projects , and for the occasional repair to a too-loved kid 's book.At first , I was a little less than impressed . I could n't figure out how to get the stapler open . It 's not like the home office staplers I 'm used to ( the top does n't flip up ) . Took me a bit to find that the only instructions are on a label on the bottom of the stapler . Then took me a bit longer to figure it out ( you gently press the bottom of the stapler up then it slides out ) . So that annoyed me.However , then I tried it out , and started liking it more . On the box , it mentions that you can use one finger to staple papers , and it promises to staple 20 pages . I was a bit skeptical , and expected jamming , half-bent staples , etc . That did n't happen . It performed as advertised . Better yet , one of the kids came in and of course , wanted to staple papers too . I thought this was a good test , to see if she could easily staple all 20 pages . She had no problems at all ( with our old stapler , either she could n't staple more than 5 pages , or we had to re-do the staple a few times due to jamming or half-bent staples ) . Figured out how to open it to reload staples quickly too . I really liked that there were n't any half-submerged staples with sharp-ends sticking out . This will work well with our various crafts and other projects , and the kids will be able to use it . And for me , that 's one of my biggest considerations.The only problem was that it did n't pop up all the way after stapling , so I had to pull the top up a bit to staple again . Otherwise , after a tiny learning curve , it worked pretty effortlessly.Update : Had to lower the rating . This stapler has not lived up to its competition and is now broken and unusable . My biggest problem is that the initial difficulty in reloading it got steadily worse . It was decent for a few months , and still was the easiest for the kids to use .	-1
The first thing I noticed when I took this stapler out of the box was that it felt so cheap . It 's a lightweight plastic , unlike my faithful old metal Swingline stapler . I expect a stapler to have some heft to it so that it is stable to use , but this stapler does not feel stable in my hand . Still , I gave it a thorough tryout . And I discovered that if I did not staple exactly the same way , with exactly the right touch each and every time , the stapler started stapling erratically . Sometimes it would staple through the pages and sometimes the staple went in cockeyed . I gave it a lot of tries before I decided it was not worth it to keep trying . And frankly , I do not see the `` 20 sheet capacity '' , as anything over 6 pages was a dicey proposition : sometimes it stapled beautifully , sometimes it did not . I also expected that I could use a lighter touch , since the stapler is advertised as a `` one touch '' unit . But I found I have to exert just as much force to staple as I do with my old stapler . The other major issue is the stapler does not unfold flat . So it is useless for stapling on flat surface , like a bulletin board.On the positive side , it is lightweight and would not add a lot of weight to a briefcase or knapsack . So if you have to travel with a stapler and are n't planning on stapling a major project , it will be fine for that task . As for me , I 'm back with my gunmetal grey Swingline that has served me faithfully for years .	-1
I had high hopes for this stapler , and on first try I liked it a lot . I really like the stapling mechanism , that is designed so that you do n't have to supply the pressure that actually folds the staples . It really is a `` one hand '' stapler , that 's very easy to operate . You can gently press down on the top until it reaches the bottom and then it shoots out a staple with a satisfying snap.On the other hand , there are two pretty serious flaws with the design . First of all , the spring loader , that 's supposed to push staples up to the front so that they 're ready when you are , is unreliable . I noticed that every few times I was n't getting a staple in the chamber , and that when I moved the stapler around staples had some room in the chamber to wiggle around . I opened it up to look , and then the spring popped out . I was able to get it back in there , and the stapler works now , but it does n't hold the staples tightly , and I have to lean it forward so that gravity ensures the staples are ready , when the spring is unreliable . It 's possible I got a `` dud '' but I noticed from another review that someone else had a similar problem , which makes me think it 's not just a fluke . The second problem is less significant , as it 's part of the design and not a mistake . It 's that there 's no way to open up the stapler at the hinge . I occasionally have need to staple things onto a bulletin board and the like , and for that you have to open up the stapler at the hinge . It 's not possible with this one.I really wanted to like this stapler , and I would have been able to overlook the fact that it does n't open at the hinge . The faulty spring loader , however , is a serious problem , and prevents me from giving it a strong recommendation . You might want to take your chances - since it looks like not everyone has faced this problem - but I 'd suggest looking around for something else .	-1
The stapler is good with the gun action and easily staples 20 sheets of paper . It works my mimicking those heavy duty hardware wall staple guns . It is very light , mostly plastics , but cheap looking , and it does n't even have a rubber footing . To add staples in it , instead of swinging the anvil and the hammer apart , you slide the anvil to expose the staple chamber . This is where all hell broke loose . There is a very flimsy spring that holds the chamber to the body . The spring came off and it is impossible to put it back.Made in China.Pros : - powerful- inexpensiveCons : - flimsy- The anvil does n't swing out to use the stapler as a tack for boards .	-1
I actually like this stapler . It 's effortless , smooth , and can power through a large stack of papers ( it advertises up to 20 ) . However , immediately upon pulling it out of the box I noticed that the spring was broken which was supposed to push the staples forward so the mechanism is always ready to go . I do n't know if I just received a bad one or not , but either way , I think it is a sign at how cheaply made it is.To fix the problem I had to remove the spring and now everything works fine , but you have to swing the device forward each time you want to use it so a staple will be located at the front . After that I have n't encountered any more problems , but I 'm not confident that the lifespan of this stapler will be very long since it seems to break so easily . Overall I would n't recommend it for anyone who staples frequently , but for the price it is n't a complete rip-off .	-1
This is a nice upgrade to my classroom . I have tried many sharpeners over the years from the traditional manual wall mount to other electric sharpeners . This one is much better . It is FAST , and QUIET . I normally do not let the kids sharpen pencils other than first thing in the morning or at the end of the school day because of how distracting the noise is . This model is quiet enough to be used throughout the day and it is speedy enough that that pencils get sharpened quickly . The shavings tray is deceptively small , however . It gives the appearance of having a large capacity but it does n't . Sliding the tray back into place is not as easy as it should be and can require a bit of effort to finesse it into place . Overall , the speed and reduced noise make this a great product.Update : while the above info was true I must now add that the entire unit is being thrown in the trash . The gear is stripped . Given the fact that use of the sharpener was monitored in my classroom and was only used by a couple of children each morning , I am very disappointed with this product . I really liked the quiet operation of this unit but , when it dies after a couple of months , that does n't seem to be so important any longer . The bottom line is that is provided a very expensive method of sharpening pencils since it had such a short life . My rating of five stars has been changed to two .	-1
I order the Stanley Bostitch because my old pencil sharpener died . When I say died , it sounded like it was grinding itself to bits everytime a pencil was inserted . The new sharpener showed up on time and it was pretty enough . Unfortunately , it did n't work . At all . At one point I thought I heard it trying to turn inside , but that disappeared almost immediately.Now , I would ordinarily just look at the instruction manual . Unfortunately , if there was a manual , it disappeared when I opened the box ( which is possible , my wife opened it before me ) . So , I did what I believe anyone would do . I went to the BS website and looked for an instruction manual . There was n't one . I checked that site through and through and there was nothing . I emailed the company to ask what to do , but have not heard back ( OK , so it was today and today is Sunday ) . If I do hear back , I will update my review.I 'm not inclined to give this a 1 star . I 've seen the other reviews for the sharpener and there were no similar complaints , so I 'm guessing I just got a lemon . But it does n't work , so it gets 2 stars . Having said that , it does look nice on the counter .	-1
( REVISED , May 2012 ) After moderate use for one year this device gave up and died and is now landfill junk . I stand by everything I said originally about the sharpener below ( except for the recommendation ) . I guess the hesitiation problem was a symptom of something bigger going on with the mechanism . ( Original Review , April 2011 ) This sharpener is nice because it sits upright on the desk , which means it has a smaller footprint than some of the others on the market . That said , it also puts a nice point on the pencil every time without making a lot of noise ( it 's not silent ) and the cut wood is nice and smooth and not slivery.There is a `` centering '' issue that at least one other reviewer brought up and can be corrected by holding the pencil at a certain angle so its perpendicular to the cutters . To me , it 's not a big issue , but some pencil purists may object . I also noticed that there are times that the sharpener hesitates like it 's jammed but then starts up and runs fine . I do n't know if this is a signal of a problem that will get worse over time , so I 'll give this rig 4 stars and will report in if anything develops in the future.I would recommend this to anybody wanting a solid space-saving sharpener .	-1
I am disappointed in this , have had it one day . Prints photos horrible , even with best , photo papers it does n't always grab them , prints horrible on them . Sometimes does n't recognize what you want . I will try a little while longer . Disappointed for now . I was hoping photos would be nice . Not good , even tried small .	-1
I like gel pens when they work right . These were a bit different because they are a click pen . My husband needed to write on carbon paper and these did not work for that purpose . I have tried writing with several of them and they skip or leave big globs of ink behind . Might work for art projects if in different colors but for everyday writing BIC stick pen are better .	-1
I love gel pens . And , in general , I love Bic pens . I thought this was a marriage made in Heaven.The reality was south of the border . First , the pen is a bit thick and uncomfortable to use . But I could live with that . The real problem ? These pens do n't write smoothly at all -- in fact , writing is almost impossible . You do the loosening up of the pen thing by making circles until the ink comes out , and then the pen sticks . It does n't move . Then you loosen the pen up again , and repeat , to no success.My husband was all excited when he saw the box of pens ... and then he tried one . He was horrified.I ca n't write anything positive , much as I 'd like to .	-1
Edit 7/13 : I have learned that you must use these pens at least a few times or they completely dry up . I recently discovered that the 1/2 box I had n't used were all completely dead . However , the pens I had been using still worked fine._________________________________________________________________This is a more pricey pen than I normally use . I wish I could tell you they 're worth all the extra dollars . There 's nothing wrong with them , they write fine & feel quite nice . They 're certainly miles beyond the usual 25 cent pens at the dollar store . I have had better pens for less $ 's , though.I have no clue what the benefit of gel vs ink is , I may be missing something there ! 1 Note that I do n't believe anyone else has mentioned : 10 of my 12 pens had a small piece of glue on the point that must be removed before the pen will work . I assume it 's there to stop the gel from drying out . I only mention it as the packaging makes no mention of it & it takes just enough force/effort to remove the glue that i was initially concerned it might damage the pen ( it does n't harm the pen & I now believe the glue is intentional ) .The box that holds the pens also arrived pretty smashed , but it did n't damage the pens.If this is your normal price point for pens , I have nothing bad to say about their performance.Edit 7/16/11 : I 've now been using these for a few weeks & my opinion has changed . I have crummy handwriting & these are not nearly as precise as a ballpoint , so it exaggerates my handwriting problem . I would not purchase them .	-1
The BIC Triumph 730RT Gel Pen ( 0.7mm ) is a nice pen to look at , feels solid but not overly large in my hand , and usually writes a nice solid line on plain paper . Unfortunately , there are a few issues that force me to downgrade this pen : - Compared to other pens I have tried , both ink pens like theZebra Z-Grip Retractable Ballpoint Pen , Medium , 1.0 mm , Black Ink 12-Countand gel pens ( see below ) , the BIC 730RT seems to be a bit `` scratchy '' on paper and does n't always write as smoothly and fluidly as other pens I 've tried.- The gel pen is more prone to smearing than the Zebra ink pen ; see the attached picture for a comparison between the two.- I thought that the gel pen might be a better choice on glossy paper , but it really did n't do a better job drawing on glossy paper than the ink pen ( neither did very well here ) .- After a while I have been finding more issues with this pen not writing consistently - it will be OK for a sentence or two then just `` skip '' putting ink down for a few letters.Edit January 2013 - after comparing this to the less expensiveuni-ball Signo Gel 207 Retractable Roller Ball Pen , Medium Point , Black Ink , 12-PackandPilot G2 Fine Point , Black Gel Ink Pens , Box of 12 , I have to strongly suggest one of these two instead of the BIC . Both the uni-ball and Pilot pens write more smoothly than the BIC , have writing quality at least as good as the BIC , and currently cost about 60 % of the price of the BIC 730RT .	-1
November 2013.Nice phone.But returned.One fatal flaw.There is a delay when using dial/number keys.I refuse to pay good money for a phone that has this flaw.My old AT & T ; cordless speakerphone system has no delay when pressing dial keys/numbers.Hey , AT & T . ; Ca n't you make/market/sell phones that have the same features - or better- then previous phones ? This phone Is a step backwards.I still have my older AT & T ; EP5995 phone systems that is far superior to this phone.My guess is that AT & T ; has basically given up on cordless home phones and is now just marketing junk phones and by doing so diluting the AT & T ; brand name.This phone was returned and money back .	-1
I bought this phone to be used for personal and business use the recorder quit working and I was now without a phone . would not recommend this phone had 2 of them neither worked	-1
Bought these phones because the ones I had from Uniden for about 10 years finally went bye-bye . I use the phones several times a day for long periods and have never had a problem with the battery running low to soon or losing signal . **UPDATE** 12/03/2013I bought these phones on October 7th , 2013 and just started having battery problems with 2 of the phones . I called the 800 number listed for them and they tell me they ca n't send me new batteries for the phones . I will not buy from AT & T ; again . I will keep these phones until the go completely out and buy better ones from somewhere else .	-1
I purchased this because I was so happy with its predecessor , the HL-2140 , that I `` ran into the ground . '' But o'm'gosh , what a disappointment ! It comes with the lower-volume TN-420 cartridge , but that printed less than 1,000 copies of the 1,500 it 's rated for ( and I use the `` toner save '' setting most of the time because of printing mostly text versus graphics ) . I replaced it with the higher-volume TN-450 cartridge , and streaks are a constant problem . The online recommended remedy for streaks is to replace the drum - hmmm , did you mean a 1-month old drum ? Also , I print black and gray bold text a lot , and no matter how much I lighten the gray , everything looks black .	-1
Wow ... starts off amazing ! But there 's a reason why its refurbished - the manufacturer screwed up and had to fix their mistakes . It lasted a whole week of occasional shredding . We emptied the bin twice before it started saying `` anti-jam '' and spitting the paper back out . I carefully removed little shreds of paper from the sides under the cutting tools and it worked again for a half a bin . Removed more paper shreds and it worked for a half a bin . SERIOUSLY ! ! ! Not worth my time ! Consumers should not have to keep maintaining this every week.It did work great and makes the tiniest paper shreds I 've seen but at what cost ?	-1
These are a good idea and tried using them on the wall but as soon as you put a few things in them they fall off the wall , the sticky tape just does n't hold well enough . I wanted to use them for gift cards and for mail sorting but it is a big fail when they ca n't stay on the wall , the only way to keep them on the wall is to use something else like maybe a large tack . The sticking ability really needs improved on these .	-1
I thought these would be great for organizing the various papers that seem to overtake my kitchen throughout the day . I used the smaller size for coupons and this was very helpful . They are easy to find when I 'm on my way to the store . The larger size I wanted for my daughters numerous school notices but the folder is very thin and does n't hold much . Its hard to squeeze a notice in when others are in there . The folders stick very well but are not like post its . Dont expect to detach and reattach them . All in all I wouldnt spend money on these . My husband , however does the ordering at work and they are put to good use there . He just put in an order for some so they might be much better in a work environment .	-1
The first thing I did n't like was the price for only three in a package . Also , I did not find the sizes very useful . They have double stick post it type tape to put them in place and it is easily removable but I 'm not sure how well they will stick once moved several times especially with added weight of being paper stuffed.I was hoping the largest size would fit inside of the cover of my spiral bound notebook to hold lose pages and notes but it extends past the edges of the cover to accommodate sheet size so maybe it would work better in a lose leaf type notebook cover that is larger or some other application that seems to be escaping me . These are also not gusseted so you ca n't fit much in them . I put the small one on the fridge but found it a bit too short in width , it will hold a few receipts when folded up or coupons but not tons . The middle size I really could n't think of a use for so I put it on my notebook to hold a pen because it reminded me of a pocket protector.I really just did n't get the point of this product at all , I had trouble even finding a use for them . Maybe if the package showed more ideas of their intended purpose they would be better received .	-1
Post-It Pockets are a new office product that is offered to help in home organization . The manufacturer 's material claims that they will stick securely practically anywhere -- inside cabinets , near calendars and doors -- and remove cleanly without damaging surfaces . Furthermore , the manufacturer claims that they are durable and tear resistant , and that they will provide an easy solution to the problem of what to do with all the papers that arrive every day.Now , I 'm an admitted office products junkie , and I particularly admire the Post-It company 's nifty new ideas , but I 'm disappointed in this product . In the first place , I 'm not sure where I can hang these products so that they will not damage my just beautifully ! expensively ! painted walls . Also , looking at the sticky stripes on the back of the pockets , I doubt that they can hold the pockets up very long , particularly not if the pockets become a little heavy with all the papers that arrive every day . And there 's my final complaint : these pockets do n't have gussets , and ca n't hold very much at all . And there are some days I feel I need a forklift to carry all that mail . And these organizational pockets are of no use to me if they ca n't hold at least a few days ' mail : what 's the use of putting just one day 's mail in them and then having to further deal with that one day 's mail on the same day ? What we all do with our piles of paper is let them grow on the dining room table/breakfast bar for a few days - or weeks , if time is tight - then sort them into piles , and deal with the piles . Post-It Company : I admire your inventiveness , but this product had better go back to research and development .	-1
This phone is perfection . It announces the calls , has clear and loud amplification . The buttons are big , the phone lights up when it rings and when you dial , it announces the numbers you are pressing . It has a very clear caller ID display . I have mine mounted on my kitchen wall and it fits the standard plate and mounting screws . This is a wonderful phone for all . It stores numbers in a phone book and does everything a phone should do plus it has all of the features needed by people who have either a hearing or visual impairment . It is very comfortable to hold and ergonomically designed.I originally gave this a 5-star review , but after using it since February 2013 . I am sad to report that the batteries wear ou in less than a day . I even have an extra set of rechargeable batteries in a charger ready for when the phone dies on me . Today two important phones calls were lost because the batteries died in the middle of placing an order for gifts and then in the middle of discussions about my homeowner 's and auto insurance.I called the company and they said they were sending me some new batteries . I think this will not solve the problem and am really sad that this phone tuned out to be unacceptable after such a short period of time , but just long enough for the warranty to expire . I updated my review on June 30 , 2014 . My initial review that was favorable was written in March 2013 .	-1
Sung to the tune of You should be dancing , yeah ! , thisSamsung Color Laser Printer ( CLP-325W ) starts singing as soon as it is powered on `` I will be jammin ' yeah ! I will be jammin , yea ! `` As if that is n't bad enough , the wireless connection is very limited so to set up and change settings , one has to haul it to your pc and connect via usb . Mine has lost its settings for some unknown reason 4 times and I had to re-set it up and like I set the wireless setup is awful . Unlike other wireless printers that let it and your wireless router find each other , this one has to be connected via usb to your pc for setup and to change settings.it is heavy and takes forever to power on.I can tell it to black and white print , and it will look like it accepted and is going to do it , but when I look at the page it printed , it is in color.how do I hate thee ? let me count the ways ... ... samsung customer support also you might get someone who knows about printers and pcs or you might get a telephone support person who has never even seen a computer printer or one that can not pronounce english well enough that you are wondering if they are speaking a foreign languageMy computer has this printer listed multiple times and I can delete down to just one printer and more will magically re-appear . This has never happened to me with any other printer and is not happening with my other printers.The only thing I like about this printer is imagining throwing it out of my 3rd floor window onto the hard cement below .	-1
Worked ok for the first few months . Now I get really bad color prints . I have researched it on the net with mixed results . Samsung has few real troubleshooting resources . I paid $ 89.00 with free shipping . Its not worth that .	-1
Every time I start writing with one of the replacements , a glob of ink comes out . It then writes fine , but I have to find something to dab the ink off of the paper so that it does n't get everywhere .	-1
I had the MX700 Canon prior to their scamming me through their loyalty program when it broke down to buy this one with alleged `` free shipping '' and a discount of which I would pay more than on Amazon . Turns out it was n't free shipping at all and the total was $ 139 giving me with about what I 'd pay with free shipping on Amazon . The sales person also lied this printer was smaller then my former printer as another sales point.The MX700 was far superior to this model , they have stripped the printer 's software interface of many of the great features the MX700 had forcing me to use computer settings for scanning that is often very time consuming and repetitive . It used to be I could choose all the necessary features from the printer itself , but they reduced the choices and none of them work without adjustments on a computer . It really stinks to high heaven , their engineers must be knuckleheads.This printer is a little slower then the MX700 and it 's bottom paper tray has less paper feed while they worked on improving their backside paper feed . The improvements they attempted to make on this printer are all usefulness and illusory , nothing of any real value when you 're in a hurry and need a PDF scanned for a client to email.This is just a disaster printer , and believe me I was all ready to like it upon arrival . It 's a piece of crap and I hate it so much I am going to have to repack it and have Canon pick it up . It 's that bad . I 'm going back to HP now . Like how dumb do the software designers have to be that it does n't offer you one PDF for multiple pages that pops up after the scan ? Instead you have to check off each one on a lame interface and save it to a folder it forces you to choose.1 . Canon has an additional black print cartridge to buy because they want to make money on their cartridges . Think of the added expense of having to pay for a large black inkwell and a smaller black well . Does that make any sense at all ? 2 . Canon did not improve the speed of the printer whatsoever , in fact it is even slower than the MX700 . It 's scan feed is equally just as slow.3 . The design of this printer is also not very good , it 's really a very poor design of a round corner box , as compared to the slick MX700 style.They need to fire their engineer team who made this printer worse , not better , than the MX700 . People might be impressed with this printer but they would n't be had they experienced the MX700.Finally I thought I 'd add how sad it is of the slow progress on print technology these days . It should have been far more along by now.The Canon sales person lied on the phone to get a sale . Free shipping my behind !	-1
My late husband ordered this printer and I hated it . After he passed away , I gave it away to a church .	-1
Someone at Canon got the clever idea to make this printer `` automatically '' adjust the print heads by printing the alignment page and scanning it . There are two problems with this:1 . Everything involves messing with the crummy 2-line LCD display on the printer , instead of the pleasant and easy alignment process on your PC screen ( like most other printers , including Canon 's cheaper products ) . This display has bad contrast and no backlight.2 . The overall process never makes it clear exactly what is going on , and the user guide on the CD does not match up with what happens on the LCD display . After the page is scanned and the heads are aligned , there is no confirmation message or test page printed . I had to make up my own test page to see if the heads really were aligned . ALso , at one point , the LCD display makes it clear that I should select an OK button to go to the next step , while the user guide says I should press the COLOR or BLACK button ( why they give me an option , I do not know ) . The user guide is correct ( doing what seems obvious on the LCD will end the process before scanning ) . You can even tell it to print an alignment page from the software , but it then links you to the manual which tells you to do it from the printer . And get this : the alignment page printed from the software IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE PRINTED FROM THE LCD INTERFACE . It is a useless page with no apparent purpose.Absolutely none of the setup is obvious or automatic . During driver installation ( about 400MB of stuff ) , it mentions that you will need to align the print heads , but you have to sift through the software to do that . There is nothing like a `` do you want to do this now ? '' button as is offered for other printer installs.The scanner is n't helpful either . I tried to scan a picture , and after selecting all of the options on the LCD , it says `` please wait a while '' . Silly me , I thought that meant it would start scanning , but it never did anything . The only way I can get this to scan is by using Windows ' included picture/scan program . There is no scanner option in the `` my printer '' program which shows up in the system tray.But Canon does prompt you to do ONE thing : register ! Yes , they do n't care if you can use your printer , but they really want to get your name and address and will give you a direct link to their website .	-1
I like everything about this printer except the small and very expensive ink cartridges . I 'm looking for alternatives to the Canon OEM cartridges and I 've already had some pretty good luck with that.I found some compatible cartridges that really do seem to be 100 % compatible with Canon cartridges and at a fraction of the cost . I bought these compatible cartridges through Amazon . I can not tell any difference between the compatible cartridge print quality and that of the Canon OEM cartridges . I 've printed photos with both.The print quality of this printer is every bit as good as I hoped it would be . I am very satisfied with the way it prints photos . By the way , I 've used several of the Canon photo papers and they are all excellent and better than expected.The overall use and handling of the printer are very good and the software is very good too , although it might take awhile to learn all of the software that comes with the printer . I really like the way the front cover , rear cover and top cover open and close . It 's as though you can very quickly `` unfold '' the printer when you go to use it and `` fold it back up '' when you are done using it.The paper feeding is excellent . I never even came close to having a paper jam yet and the paper is super easy to load into the printer . I like the way the printer goes into the service position when you have it turned on and you open the top cover . This lets you replace ink cartridges . The ink cartridges snap right into the print head itself.Unfortunately , it seems as though all the printer manufacturers are playing the same expensive ink cartridge game , so I guess I ca n't put too much blame on Canon for this . I 'm looking for a good refillable cartridge and ink system now . I tried one company and that turned out very badly . But the compatible cartridges I tried worked OK , so far.Update : I 'm changing this to a one star because of trouble and expense.The ink turned out to be even more expensive than I had imagined . The ink seems to run out with very little printing . I know my ink cartridges are n't leaking because otherwise there would be ink filling up the wells around where the cartridges feed the print head . I can almost assure anyone reading this that they are not going to like the cost of ink , especially if they are using OEM ink . The cost is horrendous.But that 's not the worst problem.It looks like I might have lost a print head and I 've only had the printer a couple months or so and have n't used it much during that time . The cyan color started to malfunction . I thought maybe this was an ink clog ( it might still possibly be an ink clog ) , so I ordered a cleaning kit . I cleaned and cleaned the print head and the problem only got worse . The cyan color quit working completely after cleaning the print head , but then it started working again about a day later , although it was working very poorly . It 's still bad and that 's been several days ago.I did try out some refillable cartridges and the ink that goes with those cartridges from a company that advertises on Amazon . The cartridges did not work and caused all kinds of error messages and even caused the printer to shut down . The ink was the wrong color and left a green cast on photos that I printed . When I went back to the OEM cartridges , the printer worked and the color was immediately corrected . I also tried some compatible ink cartridges that I bought through Amazon . Those cartridges seemed to work as well as Canon OEM cartridges . There did n't appear to be any problem with them.I used the compatible cartridges first , then the refillable cartridges . As I mentioned , the refillable cartridges did not work at all and the ink color was off . Not long after this , the cyan color stopped working . I do n't know if there is any connection between the present print head problem and the refillable cartridges and ink . But I do know that the refillable cartridges caused a lot of trouble and did n't work . And the ink color was definitely off . The seller denied this and I went through a lot of trouble with them because of this problem.The bad cartridges and ink came from PrintPayLess and the compatible cartridges ( that seemed to work OK ) came from Blake Printing Supply . Please understand that the Blake compatible cartridges seemed to print with the same exact quality as Canon OEM cartridges . It 's impossible to tell about archival quality , though . That remains an unknown to me , but the visible quality was very good with the Blake product . I do n't know what I 'm going to find out later.What I decided on is to try to send a scan of the nozzle check to Canon and see if they can tell if this is a clogging problem or some electrical problem with the print head . It 's impossible for me to tell what 's wrong at this point , but I can say with certainty that I do n't like the cost of the ink , even if I never had a problem with the printer . I 'm experimenting with photography and I like to print photos . What I expect to happen ( I 'm hoping I 'm wrong ) is that Canon will blame the inks I used on the problem and void the warranty . I 'm not sure if they can do this , legally , but I 've read reviews where they 've done this to other customers . I 've also read from various sources that the manufacturer ca n't void the warranty without proving that the problem was with the ink . But then again , how are they going to prove this ? My conclusion : Regardless of the what happens with the print head , the ink is far too expensive with this printer . The cartridges are TINY and they run out before you know it . I absolutely could not believe how fast the ink was disappearing . And there is no sign of leaks . The printer acts as though it is doing unauthorized print head cleanings . I do n't know if it is , but maybe it does that when you remove and install cartridges . I 'll have to find that out . When I put in a cartridge , I can hear the printer running and running , but not printing . While this is taking place , the print head is in the farthest right position that appears to be the cleaning position and where the head parks when you turn off the printer.Update : I did some checking and think I found the problem with ink disappearing suddenly . As far as I can tell , this is the way the printer is designed . The printer appears to be doing head cleanings on its own or automatically . I 've noticed that some other people have also reported losing large amounts of ink quickly with this printer.When I turned the printer on this morning , the printer went through some kind of routine for quite awhile . I suspected that it was cleaning the print head . This was right after I turned it on . Then I did a head cleaning on purpose and the printer went through the same kind of routine with the same exact sound . So I 'm sure the printer is doing head cleanings on its own and dumping huge amounts of ink in the process . I used up several ink cartridges without doing any printing except for nozzle checks the last few times I turned the printer on . This is an extreme ripoff . I 'm going to report it as a fraud and give Canon a chance to give my money back before I file a consumer complaint against them . People need to learn to complain.Update : I ran some tests and was able to determine that the printer is literally dumping as much as 1/3 of an ink cartridge at a time without even printing anything ! Some other reviewers or people making comments said that these printers do unauthorized print head cleanings and and I can see that this is apparently true . I also have the problem with the clogged , or partially clogged , cyan color in the print head . The only cartridge that did n't lose 1/3 of it 's ink was the cyan cartridge . The other cartridges lost a HUGE amount of ink just within a couple minutes during what appeared be unauthorized and consecutive print head cleanings by the printer just a few minutes ago . I do n't know how the printer decides when to do print head cleanings . The cleanings may be completely random or possibly they occur when the printer knows it has n't been used for a few days or for some other time period . But you can bet that I 'm losing HUGE amounts of expensive ink . With OEM cartridges , my loss just during the last few minutes would have probably been around $ 20.00 and this is without printing anything but 2 nozzle check pages ! Printing a nozzle check page really takes very little ink ( as would printing any ordinary page ) . I know this because I was carefully monitoring the ink levels while turning the printer on and off and printing only a couple of nozzle test pages.One of the worst losses I 've suffered is n't the money I spent on the printer or on ink . I did use up a HUGE amount of ink . It 's the terrible hours of stress , frustration and disgust because of the trouble with the printer . This trouble destroyed all the progress I could have made otherwise . After a while , all this trouble can even start to affect your health.I set the printer aside for a while and went on to get other things done in life that were important . I will have to get rid of the printer . The following may sound like a joke , but it is not : I 'm seriously thinking of smashing the printer to bits just to keep anyone else from suffering with it and being ripped off by it the way I have . I do n't dare give it to anyone . I 'm not kidding . This printer belongs in the dumpster or in a recycling center . It is n't worth 2 cents the way it is . My main problem now is that I do n't know what other printer to buy . I 'm sure the Canon company is n't going to be much help with advice there . There is only one possibility for a solution other than throwing the printer out that I can think of , and that is to ask someone here at a place called `` The Printer Doctor '' . That 's a local place that repairs printers . He might know of some kind of solution to the problem . I 'll update some more if I decide it will do any good to complain in here and if I find out anything else important . I might not be able to do more testing because I 'm out of some colors of ink now . I went through a LOT of ink cartridges in a very short time . That 's how became aware of this problem.But here 's something else : I put many hours of research recently into inkjet printers and I found out for certain that some manufacturers use a chip to determine the ink levels in the cartridges . This printer uses cartridges with such chips . You may already know that . But it 's worse than that . The chips are designed by some manufacturers so that third party chips ca n't be used . This means that you ca n't use third party ink cartridges . And some refillable cartridges do n't work unless you buy special chips for them and even then you have to keep putting new chips on the refillable cartridges every time you refill them . Other refillable cartridges require that you remove the chips from OEM cartridges and put the OEM chips on the refillable cartridges . Then you have to buy a chip resetter to reset the OEM chips every time you refill the cartridges . Then there 's the possible problem with cheap inks . There must be some good ink out there and some way to use good refillable cartridges , but I do n't know what . I already bought some bad bulk ink from PrintPayLess , for instance . Bad ink is a common problem ! Be careful ! And there 's still the problem of the printer dumping ink.After doing hours or research on inkjet printers and inks , I can see that it 's common knowledge that there are printers that do unauthorized print head cleanings and waste lots of ink . It 's also common knowledge that chips are used by manufacturers to keep you from using third party products . It 's also common knowledge that OEM ink cartridges are terribly overpriced . Some manufacturers even put the chips *inside* the cartridge to keep you from removing it and installing it on a third party refillable cartridge and then resetting the chip . This Canon printer has the chips on the outside of the cartridge , but the printer is still the worst waste of money , time and energy and suffering that I 've been through with just any product I can remember . I 'll have to get professional advice on this ( and not from Canon ) to really know what to do . Right now it looks like this printer might be heading for the recycling center.I 'm thinking of buying a cheap black and white laser printer so I 'll at least have something to print with if I have to make a copy of a document or print an important document for some reason .	-1
Eye piercing blue Power On LED . ( It Should be a red or green LED . ) The blue light is a big distraction . `` Power On '' indicator lights should be red or perhaps green , never blue.Google > Blue lights unhealthy & lt ; and draw your own conclusions.As soon as I plugged in the USB cord my Macintosh OS automatically asked me if I wanted to install the drivers from the Internet . I selected yes , and was printing 60 seconds later.I went to the Canon website and was unable to find any utility drivers to determine ink levels or other maintenance needs . These appear to be unnecessary , as they are built into the Macintosh operating system.When this printer is ready for retirement , consider recycling the blue power on LED indicator as an aircraft landing light .	-1
These dividers are pretty and will add pizazz to a binder- if you can get them in . Three of the five in the pack I got did n't have the holes punched out of the side . For binder dividers they are also quite thin- almost too thin to support the tabs on each one if they have any paper against them .	-1
I got these because they 're billed as & # 34 ; erasable , & # 34 ; and since other reviewers claim they truly are , I 'm baffled . I tried writing on the tabs with a Sharpie , a ballpoint pen and a pencil , and none of them could be erased . If a special writing instrument is needed or a specific tactic to erase , it 's not mentioned in the very sparse verbiage that came with the product . So I went to the Wilson-Jones website and found a forum whereby a buyer asked the same question I have . Here is the Wilson-Jones answer : & # 34 ; To ensure best erasability , write on the tabs with pencil or an erasable ball point pen. & # 34 ; Seriously ? Pencil and & # 34 ; erasable ballpoint pen & # 34 ; are erasable on ordinary paper products ! So what 's the selling point for these & # 34 ; erasable & # 34 ; tabs ? In fact , I could n't even erase pencil from these tabs.If I wanted normal dividers that ca n't be erased , I would have gotten something else , because these are very thin . Some might like the fact that they 're colorful , but I see that as a detriment . Some of the dividers are black or dark brown on one side , with a busy print of very high-contrast shapes on the other , and since the so-called erasable tab is a transparent piece of plastic-type material , how are you supposed to easily read what you 've written on the tab ? The background is either super-dark or see-through . Even if you used a white or yellow ink , you 'd have a tough time reading it on the fancy-print side.So those are the cons . Pros : They 're inexpensive . And the concept is good , if only they were truly erasable . I hope someone can post a comment explaining how these can be erased .	-1
My daughter was very excited when she saw these . She loved the various designs the purple being her favorite . She got them all set in her new binder and she already tore two of them . The paper is pretty cheap and they have a strange odor too.Would skip and spend a little more money on a better product than this .	-1
While very pretty , the Wilson Jones Index Dividers are simply not durable . The dividers are made out of thin paper material that much really is n't heavier weight than standard printer paper . With such thin index dividers , I can imagine these will rip very easily and very quickly after a couple of uses . For the cost you 're paying for the design , I would sooner buy more quality dividers and cover them with scrapbooking paper for the design . I would not recommend buying these and would instead get some good plastic index dividers .	-1
These tab index dividers are basically just colorful printer paper with tabs on them . They do have reinforcement on the hole punch side and on the tab , but other than that it 's pretty flimsy paper . I was hoping for something with a heavier weight , like cardstock . The colors and designs are nice , but I do n't think these dividers will stand up to very much abuse/use .	-1
These would be great for a project that gets light and gentle use . They look good but they will not stand up to any sort of hard use . They are also not erasable not even with a pencil . One of those things that looks great on your monitor , but is not practical for everyday use .	-1
I do n't understand why the advertising info about these dividers does n't match the info on the actual pack of dividers . The pack I got says nothing about being erasable or being made of heavyweight stock . For what it 's worth , my tabs were erasable when I write with pencil . It 's great that these are printed with soy ink , but they are as thin as a nice piece of paper . They are n't even as thick as cheap cardstock . They are reinforced along the hole-punched edge and are really cute , but I just ca n't get over how thin they are.FYI , Here 's what was printed on the adversiting on the package I received : * Easy to write on tabs* Complementary solid color on back* 3-Hole punched* 5 Unique designs-Printed with soy ink-Made in China-Fits 3-ring binders	-1
These are paper dividers with nice patterns . I like the colors and tabs , but the material used for these is super flimsy and thin . It does not look much thicker or sturdier than regular copy paper , and it 's easily wrinkled or creased . In fact , one of them arrived creased and smudged.While they are attractive , I have to say they are totally not worth the cost- especially for only 5 of them . You 're paying almost $ 1 each for what is essentially a nicely printed sheet of paper with a tab on it . The material needs to be a lot thicker and more robust than this .	-1
The contrast stitching is a nice touch , but the brown hue is pretty unappealing . Likewise , I would envision this to be somewhere around the $ 4.99 mark ( there 's not much to it ) . Moreover , while there is a pocket on the inside , it is only attached on two sides and pretty loose , so papers easily fall out.The instructions on how to recycle the case are ON the binder itself in GIANT print . There is no way to remove it . For this reason , I would not dream of using it in a professional setting . And , the appearance is a bit too & # 34 ; mature & # 34 ; for a child to take to school.I think there are better , equally as & # 34 ; green & # 34 ; products out there . Maybe consider one of those .	-1
UPDATE : The second time I reached for this stapler , it did not work . I ca n't figure out why it does n't work , so now it is just a paperweight . Change from 4 stars to 1.ORIGINAL COMMENTS : I admit that it took me a good five minutes to figure out how to open this stapler to insert staples . There is a small photo showing the opened position , but no instructions on how to get there . Aside from my pathological need for instructions for relatively simple mechanical tasks , I like this stapler . It may not be as powerful as the 24 '' model that looks like it 's made from battleship steel , but it is a major step up from the average Swingline desk model , and it is very comfortable to use . The `` reduced effort '' becomes obvious after you collate & staple 100 booklets of 27 pages each !	-1
I got this to because it said easy squeeze which it is but its so heavy you ca n't use it long . I ended up putting more effort than not . Totally disappointed .	-1
When this binder arrived , we instantly noticed a ripple in the front cover . The `` cheap '' appearance made us value it at around $ 4.99 ( like something you might find in Big Lots or another such outlet store ) . We already decided that the item itself was one-star -- the distorted cover , the cheap plastic , and the alarming price tag ( again , it 's NOT leather and over $ 20.00 ) all added up to a `` bad product . `` THEN , we saw the warning label attached to the tag . It literally states that this product contains chemicals known to cause BIRTH DEFECTS and REPRODUCTIVE HARM . How does this product exist ? Like some other reviewers and comment-givers , I would not dream of allowing my child to use this ... I would not use this ... I would not give this to my worst enemy . And , as a vegetarian , yep , I would much prefer REAL leather to this vegan , cheap , cancer-causing material.We deposited this directly into the refuse bin .	-1
When I saw this online I thought it was pretty cool but when I got it home it was n't what I thought it was feels pretty cheap	-1
I was really hoping for a product that would see my hubby through his business meetings , but this is n't it . While it looks great on the outside , the inside is rather lacking . The business card holder , along with the file pockets , only hold a couple pieces of paper . The three ring binder section is fine , but if you need to hold loose papers or take/hold business cards for/from multiple people , there 's just no room . The elastic around the binder to help secure loose papers also really does n't do much . Papers still easily fall out unless you have a hole punch available so they can be secured by the binder rings . There 's also a funky chemical smell to this binder ( as others have mentioned ) this is very off-putting . For the cost , there are many better options .	-1
I received this binder free in exchange for an honest , unbiased review , and that 's what you 're getting . If I had paid $ 20 for this binder , I would be super disappointed ( and not just because I have since read all the one-star reviews about the toxic vinyl chemicals it contains ) . The cover is indeed & # 34 ; fancier & # 34 ; than a typical 3-ring binder , but it 's also flimsier feeling and not as solid . You can flex and bend the entire binder easily with your hand , which I 'm not concerned will damage my papers , but I just do n't like the feel of it . The pen-holder thing broke before I even used it ( I have a bad habit of pulling tags off instead of cutting them off , and pulling the tag ripped the pen holder off right along with it ) .It is basically just a glorified 3-ring binder on the inside . It has decent three rings that seem strong enough , a slot for a business card , and a thin pocket on both the front and back covers that could perhaps hold one or two sheets of paper . It is n't anything fancy , and aside from the pretty cover , which I think looks better in the picture than it does in real life , this is just a binder . Is it worth $ 20 ? Not in my opinion . Ten or fifteen dollars , maybe.I can see why the high-star reviews are from people who are using these as a professional presentation binder , because they do look nicer than a plastic binder , BUT for everyday functionality , I would keep looking .	-1
There was a time when the name Wilson Jones stood for good quality . Having recently reviewed a different Wilson Jones binder and now this one , I think that reputation for quality is a thing of the past.I was quite excited about receiving this binder , as the idea of the & # 34 ; cut and sewn & # 34 ; cover made it sound as though it would be covered with heavy material . It is not . The vinyl cover is thin and on the binder I received , it does n't fit tightly over the chipboard covers . The result is a wavy finish that looks . . . cheap.When you run your hand over the cover , it feels plasticky . Again , cheap . At almost $ 20 , it is not cheap to buy . Were I buying it , I would n't pay over $ 5 , and I might not pay that.The problems do n't end when you open the covers . This inside coverings are so tightly adhered to the chipboard covers that I could barely insert a sheet of ordinary copy or typing paper . The three ring binder apparatus appears to be the same quality you would find in a one dollar binder from the dollar store . It does n't feel substantial or reliable . My binder had strips of cardboard protruding from each side of the binder rings . My first though was they were there to protect the cover from the rings pressing into them ( and they may be ) but as they do n't remove , I now think they are meant to be paper lifters , to keep the paper from settling below the rings and tearing . This would be thoughtful and useful it they were sturdy plastic instead of lightweight cardboard . They too look cheap.All in all this is a greatly overpriced product manufactured with poor quality control and cheap products . Very disappointing .	-1
I was not much impressed with this notebook . It is kind of a light weight and thin cardboard and was a little warped . There are lots of nice notebooks available that are practical and maybe not as fancy but they will last a lot longer than this notebook .	-1
I rarely receive an item that I ca n't find at least one positive thing to say about it . This binder has exactly one positive attribute.Pro : The one positive thing about it is that it is a recycled item.Cons : * My first thought right out of the package was that it would have been better to not have any artwork . Truly , the picture on the website looks nicer than it does in person . * The board is stiff and once opened does n't like to close again . * It came with a sticker on the front that when removed left big chunks of it behind and it wo n't come off the surface without messing up the front of the binder . * The inside clips are are cheap* The back of the binder has oily type marks on it that wo n't wash off . I 'm assuming it is from over-spray of glue that got on it from the factory.My advice -- skip this one .	-1
This is a very pretty binder . However , its very stiff and does n't close all the way . Its hard to open and close , and when shut it remains open at the end . The cardboard sides are bowed in the middle ( which might just be the one I have ) and all in all the binder is very heavy . The three rings inside have to be opened at both ends at the same time , and are very stiff . Also , the rings are very small for the size of the binder . All in all , I 'd give this one a miss .	-1
After using this for a while I have to change my review : While it is easy to press down with minimal effort , I found that unless you press down pretty hard the staples do n't always flatten . These could poke out , and the special staples it uses are pretty sharp . While it 's not going to do a lot of damage , it 's annoying to have to keep removing and re-stapling . I just want my stapler to work . It also kind of undermines the whole `` reduced effort '' selling point . I really ca n't recommend this stapler . That being said if you do n't mind slaming it down it will get the job done .	-1
My wife is a middle school teacher and loves the fit , feel , and easy use of this stapler but she will not use it after one batch of staples . Why ? Because the required staples , B8 Power Crown Premium staples STCR75XHC , cost 9.19 for a box of 1,000 . In contrast , my wife can buy standard staples box of 5,000 for $ 4 . Over the long haul , this stapler is just too expensive to use .	-1
The only advantage is that it can staple about 60 pages ( claim is 75 ) with ease because it has more leverage due to its big size . But it is heavy , bulky , takes a lot of room on the desk and uses properieteryStanley Bostitch B8 Xtra High Carbon PowerCrown Staples ( STCR75XHC ) that are more than double the price of Swingline staples . The stapler itself does not come with any staples at all and standard staples -Swingline S.F . 3 Premium Chisel Point Staples , 0.25 Inch Leg Length , 105 Count Half Strips , Silver , 5000 Staples per Box ( S7035440 ) - do not fit in this stapler . The basis for antibacterial claim is hard to figure out . The stapler comes with no instructions or staples and you have to figure out to press the button and then pull staple housing forward to load the staples.There is a reason it probably does not come with any staples : when you order the staples , you are going to feel ripped off ! Most expensive staples out there.Even if you need to staple multiple pages ( > 50 ) , I feel thatSwingline Deluxe Heavy Duty Stapler ( S7039005R ) , which , as of now is a few cents more expensive , is better constructed and more ergonomic stapler . In the long run you will save a lot in the cost of staples with Swingline stapler because the staples for this Stanley stapler are exorbitantly expensive .	-1
I love the idea of a pen-like device I can carry around for making presentations on the go . This is nothing new , technology wise , except that the usb is integrated into the main canister of the pen , making it easy to transport in pocket or small bag . It has a sturdy matte finish that 's grippy in my hands ( especially good for clumsy types ) , and it 's not too chunky to look funny when clipped in a short pocket.My beef with the pen is for the following:1 . Mac compatibility issues . Try as I might , I could not get the usb fob to sync up with the pointer on any of three different macs including a 2012 Macbook Air , a 2011 Macbook Pro , and a 2014 macbook air . So ... that 's a big deal.2 . The buttons to progress forward and backward are small and hard to figure out , directionally . It 's easy to push the laser button by mistake , and there 's no blank screen button . The interface for the buttons really could use some improvement .	-1
As a Mac user , this is frustrating - plug the USB portion into my Mac and up comes & # 34 ; Keyboard Setup Assistant & # 34 ; saying that to continue , I need to & # 34 ; press the key immediately to the right of the Shift key on the left side of the keyboard & # 34 ; . Obviously this ca n't work - it 's not a keyboard and has no keys . So now I just have a very elaborate laser pointer . At least our cats like it .	-1
I wanted a small portable sharpener . Unfortunately this does not work . It is not missing any parts and I tried sharpening with several different types of batteries ... .the correct kind of course . Nothing , it spun around and the pencils never sharpened . Their tips were just barely chewed and I wonder if this is a prototype and that the unit is not properly manufactured to fit the pencil as it is sharpened.Very disappointing.I hope for the company that this is a fluke but even if it is they should really have better quality control.Sorry this is a dud ! ! ! ! ! M	-1
So , first off the backing that holds the battery in place is coming off- twice now and I 've had it for just a few days . I *really* wanted a pencil sharpener that did n't need to be plugged in , that the kids could use ( they keep stealing my cosmetic pencil sharpener which is just a small little thing . I would n't mind except it does n't catch the shavings and then I have to hunt for it when I need to sharpen eye or lip liner or whatever . ) The only way I could sharpen a pencil with this was to open the front cover , take out the batteries , and apply counterforce to the blade as I sharpened the pencil . ( runs on two double A 's but chews through them fast.My hubs was sure he could get it up and running but we decided to stop when the motor started to smell like something was burning up.Disappointment ! I would have bought one for everyone if it had worked well because the kids are always complaining about not having pencils- they have plenty of pencils , just ca n't find a decent thing to sharpen them with . I know you can get plug-in units that work decently- we had a behemoth from like 1970 for ages but it finally gave up the ghost.Anyhow , I could have received the ONE pencil sharpener that as soon as you removed the covering to empty the non-existant 'shavings ' the plastic housing would start to come apart . It sure made a heck of alot of noise like it was sharpening a pencil- kind of like my kids cleaning their rooms- but nothing ever actually got done without me , literally , keeping my thumb on the thing and using it like a non-electric sharpener.It does look small and sleek . Woo ! I.e . this will make a decent paperweight if you need some non-functional piece of office equipment to take up space ( even if it a small space ) .	-1
We had a Boston Nautilus SharpenerBoston Nautilus Battery-Powered - Sharpenerwhich recently was dropped and broke . That sharpener was great and had a lot more power than this one , even though it does not have the greatest reviews on Amazon . When we received this one we were amazed how small this one is - not much larger than a credit card from profile . The mechanism looks extremely fragile and you have to push the pencil in harder than on other sharpeners - and you have to hold on to the minuscule unit so it wo n't spin . A cheap blade is doing the cutting instead of a more advanced mechanism involving cutting cylinders . This causes the graphite to break more easily than in more advanced models - or even in manual sharpeners.UPDATE 1/27/12 : The `` sharpener '' blade still rotates two months later , yet pens are no longer sharpened , no matter how hard I push ( without breaking the cheap plastic ) . I tried various pencils - same result . Batteries get recycled , the rest is in the trash . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Pens are the writing utensil of choice , but I still like to use pencils from time to time , due to their erasability and other factors . The reason many hesitate to use pencils is , of course , the inconvenience of having to sharpen , but this problem is easily remedied with the right pencil sharpener . A good electric sharpener does the work for you , eliminating much of the inconvenience that makes people avoid using pencils in the first place.The Stanley Bostitch Minisharp Battery Powered pencil sharpener is , unfortunately , not the good , convenience- enhancing pencil sharpener I was hoping for . This pencil sharpener is about as simple and basic as an electric powered sharpener could be , with nothing more than a small blade on the inside that looks much like a tiny , manually operated pencil sharpener . It turns when a pencil is inserted , but the problem is that it does n't work very well at all . At first , I was convinced that I was doing something wrong but I found that no matter how I held the pencil , whether I held it steady or turned it back and forth , the blade just did n't do the job . It sharpened so slowly I gave up and resorted to manual sharpening.Another issue I have with this pencil sharpener is the lack of instructions . You will eventually figure out how to perform tasks like opening the battery compartment , inserting the batteries , and releasing the door for waste removal , but the manufacturer should have provided a simple set of instructions explaining this . Your frustration level is piqued from the beginning , and it does n't get any better when you discover that the device does n't work.If there is anything good to say about this pencil sharpener , it would come down to two main things : The compact size and the portability . It is small enough to fit in the tiniest desk space or school bag and because it does n't have an electrical cord , it can be taken anywhere . I also like the see- through compartment that holds the shavings because you can quickly see when it is full and know when to empty . Compartments on some pencil sharpeners are tinted and you ca n't really see the shavings very well , which can lead to overfilling . There is no problem like that with this pencil sharpener , but considering its performance , it is highly doubtful the shavings compartment will ever reach its capacity.Everyone who uses pencils needs a good , convenient sharpener but this Stanley Bostitch model is n't one of them . I finally gave up , took out the batteries , stuck my pencil inside and turned it manually . The sharpening was faster and better than using it powered . And this says quite a bit about the quality and usefulness of this device.Avoid it , spend the extra money , and get a better product .	-1
Without a doubt , this has to be the worst pencil sharpener I have ever used . If you push slightly too hard , it will not spin . Too soft and it will not sharpen . Also , it will sharpen only certain types of pencils made from a certain type of material but will not even work on other types of pencils like colored pencils . Furthermore , if you do get it to sharpen , it only makes a small dull tip that requires sharpening every couple of minutes of use or it breaks the lead and you have to start all over again . To top it off , I would expect a sturdier build from a name like Stanley Bostitch , but instead , looks and feels like something you would get at a dollar store made in China . I 'm sure that if I actually used this every day , it would n't last more than a month . This thing is awful . The only reason I was nice enough to give it 2 stars is that I was able to get one pencil to sharpen with it out of about 6 pencils tried .	-1
I picked this from the Vine offerings because I have an 8 year old in second grade , and we have to sharpen pencils a lot . I 've got a really nice manual one that works just perfectly , but thought he would enjoy a powered one.Like most of the other reviewers here , I 've found this thing to be pretty useless.It 's construction is poor , very shoddy . And it 's pretty much incapable of sharpening much at all , and is a joke when you insert a new pencil that has never been sharpened before.I ca n't even say it 's at least half way decent for the price , since it does n't even serve as a useful paperweight . The purpose it serves is a good reminder that usually you get what you pay for .	-1
The whole point of a battery-powered pencil sharpener is portability . At 3 1/4 '' x 2 1/4 '' x 1 1/2 '' , this Stanley Bostitch can fit into a student 's backpack relatively easily . With batteries installed , it weighs 5.1 Oz , which is probably an acceptable weight to add to the kid 's shoulder . For its target customers , students who are old enough to take care of a simple machinery but young enough to prefer machine assistance over manual operation , the concept has its worth.It is in execution of the concept that this item fails . First , its cutter is not the rotating cylinder type used in desktop pencil sharpeners . Instead , it uses a thin razor type blade common in hand-operated sharpeners such asSchool Smart Hand Pencil Sharpener - Box of 24 , which cost about 7 cents each . This leads to higher risk of breaking the graphite core of the pencils . There is no sensor to stop the motor . A plastic piece stops the pencil from advancing indefinitely . This works most of the time , but it further increases the risk of breakage.The build quality is just one step above shabby and instruction is nonexistent . The batteries must be installed in a particular way , or the motor would either not work at all or turn the blade in the wrong direction . But strangely , the direction for battery installation is not found in either the compartment or the cover . It is instead located at the bottom of the unit . I did not see it until well after the mystery was solved through trial and error . There is no shaving tray . The entire cutting area serves as temporary storage for pencil shavings . To clean them out , one must remove the translucent plastic cover , which does not go back in easily . Considering that the intended users are kids in elementary school , this is probably the worst design failure in this sharpener .	-1
QUICK SUMMARY : If you 're looking for a compact , battery-operated pencil sharpener , look elsewhere.Background : When I got this pencil sharpener , the black plastic housing literally fell off the unit as I tried to open the battery compartment . Shortly afterwards , a small white plastic piece and another black plastic gear fell onto the kitchen countertop . I 'm not *that* strong , folks ! So I 'm astonished that the whole unit would disintegrate in my hands just by my opening the battery compartment cover ! My wife figured out where the white plastic piece was supposed to go and tediously put the thing back together again so it could work . I would have just pitched it into the garbage.What I HATE : - Poor quality ! Might as well buy a box of Crayola crayons that have a sharpener built-in to the box . You 'd have better luck with that.- Poor design ! The unit should not fall to pieces just by opening the battery cover.- Most battery-operated devices show polarity and/or battery position inside the battery compartment bay , so it 's perfectly clear how to install the batteries . With this poorly-designed unit , it 's not obvious how to install the batteries , and the polarity is shown confusingly on the body of the sharpner , which , depending on how you 're holding the pencil sharpener , can lead you to installing the batteries incorrectly.- Worst of all , we could n't get a very sharp point on the pencils we tried sharpening . The rotating razor blade will dull quickly if you use it much ( presuming you *can* use it ) . You 'd be much better off with those little throw-away , pencil sharpener razors . They take up almost no backpack space , do n't use batteries , and would do at least as good of a job as this pencil sharpener does.Conclusion : If you read this review and still buy this pencil sharpener , you have only yourself to blame .	-1
I guess there must be a few people out there who have need of such a pen and its four colors . But I have to wonder why ? Still , I guess it 's nice to have easy access to all four ( black , blue , red , green ) in one writing instrument.My real complaint with this product is twofold : it seems fairly flimsy for such a purpose . Cheap plastic top and not too sturdy a body . More important , for me at least , is the very , very thin point and the line it produces . It is thus somewhat difficult to read on the page . Also ( I guess this makes three ) there seems to be no way to replace the ink cartridges . Is this a one-time , throwaway pen ? All told -- a not very good two stars .	-1
I do n't think this lightly upgraded version of the 4 color pen brings much new to the table . The clicking mechanism still seems primed for breaking ( especially in the hands of a fidgety child ) and the ink flow is n't any smoother or reliable than my old one . I suppose the hole at the top is a nice touch for convenience sake ( to hang it around your neck if doing , say , inventory ... ) but , overall , the improved grip on the pen does n't impress me enough to consider it worth the money .	-1
This is a poorly conceived device . Let 's start with the packaging . Here Kodak gets low marks on several fronts.The P811 Personal Photo Scanner comes with several small accessories intended to be used for scanning different photo and document types . The various parts come in plastic bags and , once opened , are easily misplaced . Yet , inexplicably , Kodak provides nothing to store them in once they are out of their plastic bags . That is a recipe for disaster because , once lost , without these parts you will not be able to scan some of your photos . Kodak should have included a pouch or container of some sort to contain the parts . I had to come up with one of my own.Out of the box the scanner itself comes incased in protective plastic strips . Instead of one continuous piece of plastic , Kodak has decided to use about six or seven separate pieces of plastic -- some of which are difficult to remove since there is no tab to grab on to when removing them . ( I kept finding more and more protective plastic strips the more I worked with the device . ) If you love removing the plastic stickers from CDs and DVDs , you 're going to have a ball getting the P811 ready to scan.And then there is the matter of batteries . Just about every device that requires them also includes them in the package . Not Kodak . You have to buy the four AAA batteries yourself . And not just any AAA battery will do . Kodak recommends Ni-MH rechargeable batteries , but is quick to point out that the device itself ca n't charge the rechargeable batteries . ( More about the batteries in a moment . ) You can also run the scanner off of a wall power brick , but , again , Kodak does n't supply one . So if you want to run the scanner off of AC power , a trip to Radio Shack is inevitable . But , be warned . The device does n't tell you what voltage and amperage is used to power the device . You 'll have to dig through the user guide to find that out . ( I 'll save you the trouble . On page 21 , the user guide states the the power brick needs to provide 5V , 1A into the scanner . ) Speaking of the user guide -- although the Quick Start Guide states that the manual is on the memory card , to their credit , Kodak also supplies a printed user guide with the device . ( Although Kodak used what appears to be six point type , so if your eyes are n't young you 'll need your magnifying glass . ) Besides the user manual , there is also scanning software on the included SDHC card , so whatever you do , do not format or delete data on the card until you 've backed it up . ( By the way , good luck getting product support on the P811 from Kodak 's support site . Try as I might , the Kodak support site kept insisting that there were no support documents for the P811 . They showed a P810 that I assume is a related or prior device to the P811 . But , again , nothing showed by way of support documents even for the P810 . ) On the SDHC card you 'll find software for Macs and PCs and also the documentation . However , instead of using common sense file names for the documentation , Kodak uses unhelpful file names such as 01.Kodak P811_QSG_v1.3_E_2010-09-01 . That means you 'll have to look at each file to figure out what it is -- but it 's all there both the quick start document in multiple languages and the user guide.After disabling two of my home theater remote controls , I had the four AAA batteries that I needed for the P811 . However , they were not the Ni-MH that Kodak `` recommends . '' Still , they managed to power on the device . So how did the scanner do in scanning my photos ? I ca n't say . The device ingested my 4x6 photo , scanned about an inch of the image and then stopped cold . It completely froze and did nothing from that point on . I had to remove the batteries because even the power off button failed to work.I later learned that it 's not that Kodak `` recommends '' using the Ni-MH variety AAA battery as the manual states . It 's that the scanner requires them and wo n't work at all unless you use Ni-MH batteries or plug it in instead . So be prepared to shell out some extra cash for the Ni-MH batteries and perhaps a charger unit as well . Since these are n't supplied , my using the device will have to wait for an additional order to Amazon or a trip to my local Radio Shack.Now , I know that much of this may be my fault . Others rave about the device , so , no doubt , I am the victim of cockpit problems . Still , I am a technically adept person and this device befuddles me . What adapters go with what photos , how to power it , and how well does the device scan when you do figure this out ? That 's something that will have to wait for another day when I have time to read the six-point font manual cover to cover and buy a charger and batteries to be used with only this one device .	-1
I bought this at walmart at Christmas after hearing how good it was on ink ... wish I had bought an HP ... in 4 weeks I have gone through 2 packages of ink cartrages ( I do not pirnt much either- would not have even used 1/2 of the first pack of in on an HP ) ... also the machiene is moody and uses electric doing things when you have not used it- I leave it shut off when not in use ... I will never buy another printer from this company ... I thought after so many years with pictures kodak would get it right	-1
Do not buy this garbage ! This is the worst printer I have ever come across and I have come across a lot since 1989 . After the original ink that came with it ran out ( quickly ) when I replaced them with Kodak cartridges the calibration test page was missing a lot of black and colors . Called customer support and he tells me I need a new print head ( already ) ? ! Okay , send me one . They send the wrong one ! I call back and tell them it might help if they sent me the right part . Finally receive correct print head . Works again . On about the third cartridge replacement it does the same thing . I tried calibrations and print head cleanings all with the same terrible results until it runs out of ink after only printing about 10 test pages . Throwing this made in China junk in the dumpster where it belongs . Update 3/9/13 - To add insult to injury when I picked it up to move it for it 's trash can body slam there was a big puddle of black ink on the stand it was sitting on ! Will never purchase Kodak again .	-1
At least if you found this at your local $ store , you would be able to choose your color from the carton . I got one with a black border , and it would look awful on my refrigerator door where I had anticipated placing it . So , I decided to mount it to the wall by my desk . Problem is , the sticky pads are permanent -- not like Command Strip backings.The clear plastic of the magnets areis scuffed right out of the packaging . The joints on the frame do n't come together tightly . Tiny staples hold everything together . The marker holds very little ink and the eraser -- also very tiny -- is attached , so you wo n't be able to wash the eraser easily.I know it is not much money , but still , it is so cheap looking , I 'll use it , but otherwise keep it out of sight .	-1
I do n't expect this board to last long . The whiteboard part is moe like contact paper and the flimsy plastic frame is already separating . I use this for short term reminders so it gets erased pretty quick . I suspect that long term notes would stain up I have n't tested that out yet . I do n't believe id purchase more of these . I 'll look for something a little better , even for hidden reminder boards .	-1
I hate to say this , but this item looks like something you could buy in the dollar store.It 's not very well made . Mine had visible cracks around each side on the front of the magnetic board , where you could see a gap.You place the sticky pads along each corner on the back , then place the square magnet over that . The pen you place on the top , that also has a sticky square.Mine came with a yellow border , which I would not have picked given a choice.The board itself , the measurements are 8.5 & # 34 ; X 11 & # 34 ; , so it 's not very large.It says you can place it on any magnetic surface , so I decided to place mine on my refrigerator , but it keeps sliding down.This magnetic board does come with 2 round magnets .	-1
I own several Quartet whiteboards of varying sizes , all of which are of far superior quality than this current product . The boarder is a solid light blue plastic that looks and feels cheap . The illustrated picture looked different than my product . The seams are very noticeable and loosely connected . Two magnets are included , mine had a striped rainbow appearance , not silver as illustrated . The magnets and the pastel blue border really gave this product a & # 34 ; kid feel. & # 34 ; The Amazon description calls this a 9x11 inch magnetic whiteboard ( frames may vary ) . My product description on the package advertises Magnetic Dry Erase Board 8.5x11 ( assorted frame colors ) therefore the description appears to be a bit off . Regardless , the true writing area ( minus the frame ) is only about 7 1/2 by 9 1/2.The included 3M stickers are holding solid and I did like that the magnets were labeled & # 34 ; Tape Side & # 34 ; to ensure that you adhere them correctly . It does arrive with one marker . You can also attach the clear plastic tab to hold the marker in whatever location you desire ( side , top or bottom ) as it also attached with a 3M sticker . Upon arrival , you will notice that this clear tab is merely temporarily taped in place.I am certain that when this white board falls to the ground that the frame will snap off due to the flimsy construction.Unless this is priced really inexpensively , I would steer clear .	-1
Kinda cute , directions are clear on how to install 3M-adhesive-covered little foam blocks and then install little black magnets with correct side clearly indicated . Did those maneuvers , then happily walked to refrigerator where there is the perfect space . Trouble is , this board then promptly slid right down to the floor . The magnets simply are n't strong enough to hold the weight . Not much weight either . What is this company thinking ? They ca n't be using us for product testing - they know we tell the truth in reviews.Other than that , this is a cute , inexpensive little message or list board complete with its own pen . That part works . But now what do I do ? The 3M adhesive works fine so the magnets are n't coming back off so now I 'm stuck with something that does n't work for its intended purpose . There was no way to test for this function without putting it together . Other magnetic things stick to my metal-skinned fridge just fine . Maybe I can put one of them below this thing , hoping the stronger magnet can prevent the ol ' downward slide and that the board wo n't simply flop over ! It is probably the usual case of an `` off-shore '' manufacturer contracting to produce goods and then substituting inferior materials in order to increase profit ...	-1
This is a nice looking board and I do like the face that it is dry erase and magnetic on the front . I do not know why they used such weak magnets for the back side because do n't most people stick this to their fridge ? If you put this on your fridge it will simply slide to the floor . Interesting that the company has a note on the back label that says that if you are not satisfied they will make it better at their own expense . Sounds like a good company policy but you will need to call them on it if you want to use this on your fridge !	-1
I stuck the magnets to the board as directed , making sure to face the magnets in the right direction . But they 're so weak the board wo n't stick to the fridge . It just slides down and off.If you do n't want to use the magnets , adhesive pads are provided . But this would make the board a more permanent attachment than I want or need.The board erases well but the included marker clips onto the top , which is n't easy to do if the board shifts around.The price is right for this board if you do n't mind using the adhesive pads rather than the magnets . I do n't want to stick gluey pads onto my walls , though , so I 'm going to have to throw this away .	-1
Not much to say about this , really . I guess it does the job , as far as memos and notes go , but it 's pretty cheap . Kind of warped . The magnet is n't very strong and it keeps sliding down the door of the fridge . Would n't recommend this product .	-1
too complicated to use . just could n't figure it out . ended up having to return and I 'm pretty tech savvy . We ended up buying an Ooma device instead - much simpler .	-1

I am so sick of HP forcing me to buy a new cartridge every 6 months . I swear I have not printed more than 150 pgs and the darn XL size cartridge is already empty . Its maddening . HP really needs to get back to the basics and start making some quality products instead of trying to squeeze money out of consumers for their shareholders . My advice is shell out the extra cash up front for a Xerox printer , and save money in the long run by not getting raked over the coals with these cartridges .	-1
This product is extremely overpriced for the microscopic amount of ink provided . HP printers are excellent except for one thing : They are intentionally designed to cost you an arm and a leg to print . The cartridges have to be frequently changed because of HP skimping on the included amount of ink . A real letdown . Look for another printer if you want your finances to remain solvent .	-1
WARNING : DO NOT BUY AN HP ! IT WILL SUCK UP THE INK AND THE MONEY IN YOUR WALLET . I purchased the HP Photosmart Premium printer 6 months ago and I usually print on Black draft ONLY . I rarely use color . I ran out of color ink and color photo black twice . NOTE : I DID SAY I RARELY USE COLOR . I will also add that I did print only 3 4x5 photos . I am a retired photographer but rarely print my own photos . I used less than 300 sheets of paper printed on 8 1/2 x 11 paper set on Draft black only . IF YOU BUY AN HP YOU ARE ASKING FOR DISPOSABLE MONEY . Donate your money to a charitable organization instead of buying HP printers or ink ! ! ! I would rate HP a ZERO star if they had one ! ! ! ! ! ! Amazon should create a `` Stay away '' category instead of a start . This rip-off does n't even deserve one star ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Best Buy said that the ink will evaporate . Well if that is true than so did my hard earned money . I will go back to Epson for a more efficient printer .	-1
This product is half the size at almost the same price . There 's really not much else to say . Why HP has chosen to break customers in their products when they buy genuine HP is beyond me.With the old cartridge , I used about one cartridge every two-three months doing regular office work and proofing without fading or streaking . With the new cartridge there was streaking after only a month . This is where you really loose money . With the old one you could use twice as much , and only have to deal with fading every once and a while , with the new one , you loose the last little bits in two cartridges instead of just one.This is not only chintzy , but bad for the environment . For the same amount of ink you use twice the plastic and twice the packaging , not to mention the wasted paper and time from dealing with fading more often.Anyone that buys a product based on quantity expects to get it . Wake up HP ! You have competition from companies like Lexmark that boast 500 pages on a single cartridge for five bucks .	-1
Fact is that HP and other printer manufacturers almost surely make little or no money selling printers , especially inkjet printers . They make all of their money selling replacement ink cartridges . These ink cartridges have laughably low capacities and are not cheap . I have tried aftermarket substitutes ( usually from China ) with horrible results -- ink everywhere . Plus the printer will constantly stop mid-job to tell you that your ( full ) ink cartridge is empty when you know it is full . Or worse , that it is damaged or unusable.This XL black ink cartridge is not exactly a howling bargain . But experience has taught me to avoid the third-party substitutes made in China.The HP cartridges are tricky . For some HP printers some of the `` XL '' black cartridges are too wide to fit . Plus , there are two types of black cartridges , the photo black ( bowtie symbol ) and regular black ( pentagon symbol ) . And if this is not confusing enough , sometime HP just puts a circle-black symbol on the ink , just to make sure that we are confused.Time was when there was one cartridge with all the ink colors . The disadvantage here was that when one color ran out you had to throw the whole cartridge away even when other colors were not depleted . Now , with color-specific cartridges , there is less waste . But you will find yourself constantly changing cartridges as one or the other colors becomes depleted in the middle of a job or between jobs . A significant trade-off . I find it almost impossible to get through a print job without changing a cartridge on my HP inkjet printer . Well , the Epsons and Canons are no better . RJB .	-1
I think this ink is counterfeit ! It is advertised as an authentic HP ink cartridge . We bought this a month ago and it ran out of ink within a month despite barely using our printer . We also got a package from a different retailer with other colors , and they are all completely full . I 'm really angry we got duped ! Do n't buy these .	-1
This is a dispenser for post it notes which dispenses them one at a time . It is sturdy and adorable but pointless for me . Id rather just pull a sheet off the pad then fumble with this dispenser . If you dont pull right , the paper gets stuck . It also doesnt use regular post it pads , you have to buy refill pads which are more expensive . Once the pad that came with this is depleted I probably wont use this again .	-1
This product is big and heavy and takes up valuable space on the desk , and there 's nothing to rest the individual sheets on so you can write on them . I much prefer writing a note directly on the pad and then pulling the sheet off and sticking it on the paper or object . If you put the dispenser in a drawer , it does n't clutter the desk top but takes up needed drawer space . It still does n't allow for jotting down a note quickly . There 's too much of a procedure involved . This is a device that makes a task more difficult , not easier .	-1
I utilized the fasteners to hang photographs in the office and in my home . Nonetheless , there 's nothing extraordinary about the product . I would n't purchase this item in the future .	-1
I reviewed earlier on some strips from Scotch and there is not much comparison between the two . This is not meant to keep something very tight . It is much more like a loose velcro and my first attempt in fastening things with them was not very convincing ... One good thing about it is that there are quite many in the pack .	-1
This is the worst ink and the most expensive ink I have ever had . It barely lasts and I rarely print on it . I will not be buying another Kodak printer again . You are better off with a laser printer .	-1
First of all Kodak printers are garbage . Then to rub salt into your wound these cartridges are not full and do n't last at all ! Will never waste another penney on Kodak ever again !	-1
Shopping around for labels can be difficult . You have no way to know the quality until you try them . Now I see that you have no way to know the quality the next time you order the exact same item.The first batch I received was great . Printed up nice , ink did not smear at all.The next batch smears . I did not change printers , did not change ink cartridges . But now I have to be very careful when pasting the label onto a package since rubbing the print will make the ink smear.I guess I 'm back to shopping around for labels I can trust .	-1
I have purchased these labels , and loved them . The last two boxes , yes boxes , they are packaged differently and do not stick to the envelope . No doubt these are not the real digi orange because they were the only ones I would use . Says made in China ... ... ... very disappointed in this product . Check your quaility control ... ... ... .again , the last two shipments are not the same quaility .	-1
The layout of these labels are exactly like Avery 5160 , however the quality is not as high as Avery . Okay so I have no problem when I print labels one sheet at a time but when I need multiple sheets and print from my printer 's tray these tend to stick together and my printer will pick up 2 sheets at a time or get confuse and print part of say like bottom of page 1 on bottom of page 2 . Sometimes it also get jammed because they tend to stick together . At this price you expect that the quality would not be the same so overall I give it 4 stars .	-1
call block is useless , the phone will still ring several times with telemarketers calling before the phone remembers to block it . Also , even if you tell the phone to be silent , it will still repeat any incoming messages being left on the machine .	-1
At first glance and use this phone is great . I purchased this along with 1 extra handset so I have 6 handsets . Set up was a breeze.PROS : The caller ID and phone book is the same on each phone . If you delete something on one or change it on one , it changes on anotherThe phone has different groups you can put phonebook entries in -- 9 in all -- -what is great about that is that you can assign each a ringtone or search by group . You can assign each person in the family a ring tone so that when someone calls for them and it is in the phonebook , the phone rings a certain way and you know who the call is for . Or you can assign work contacts to their own ringtone so you can ignore those when you want . This can reduce the need for people to pay for 2 separate lines unless you need them because you need to talk on the phone at the same time.You can assign each phone its own nameYou can page one phone at a time or all of them ( great for the intercom feature or trying to find a lost phone -- my other system paged every phone so trying to find a lost phone was sometimes challenging ) .Has a much farther reach than the 2.4 and 5.8 phones . It does n't interfere with my wireless networking.CONSIf there is a voice mail ( i use the voice mail system from the phone company ) -- the phone displays `` New voice mail ) rather than the phones name . The name wo n't show up until you listen to the voice mail . I find this aggravating many times as I already know I have voice mail because the light is blinking and for whatever reason , i 'm just not ready to check it.if you have no voice mail , the icon for voice mail goes away , which means you have to go through the menu and press it about 4 or so times to get to voice mail . My last phone has a voice mail button all the time for one touch voice mail access . I save a lot of messages and want to go back and listen and i miss being about to have 1 touch access . If there is a new message , a voice mail icon is lit and you do have 1 touch access.You need to remember what phone you assigned to what handset number because the base unit where you press the locater services button does not store the names -- you have to select by number . This is n't too bad -- i do n't remember what handset is what so i just page each one individually . However , if I was using the intercom , i would want to remember what number was for what phone . I do n't understand the purpose of being able to name the phone ( other than to get it to its original charging station ) if you still have to remember which handset number it isProgramming was NOT intuitive . I had to use the instruction manual and have had to pull it out several times to remember how to do something . I honestly think that is a little ridiculous . We are at a day and age where simple things like this should be intuitive ! ! All of my other phones have been.There is a limit of 6 handsets -- not all companies limit it to 6 handsets.While the talking caller ID is ok , there is a delay , so often i already know who it is before it tries to pronounce it . Pronunciation is n't great , but its ok . I personally find it not very helpful . Although it has been nice at times . For me , it would n't be a reason to buy this phone alone because of the major problems i list below.The caller ID keeps track of every number and each time they call . At first , I liked that compared to my old phone that would just display the most recent time called and the total number of times called . But what I found out is that often my caller ID history does n't go back very far in time because the people that call a lot end up using the space up . This is disappointing to me because I must be lazy and have used my caller ID memory as a way to know the numbers of people that have called . Before , my history could last for a month . With this phone it is usually gone after a couple of days . They both stored the same amount of numbers in the caller id bank -- -but when the majority of my calls are from the same few people , they did n't take up much space with the other system . Does this make sense -- if not , someone comment to me and I will try to change it.POTENTIALLY MAJOR PROBLEMSI have had more difficulty hearing people on these phones than my other phones . I have had these phones a couple of months . Most of the time it is clear -- but there are times when it is echoey or crackly . I did read other people having problems and found that when i set the home base unit in a room father away , it seemed to help because the ECO mode is turned off most of the time . When ECO is on , there are many more problems with clarity . Although the manual says eco mode will turn off by itself , there is n't a way to turn it off on your own . FOR THIS REASON ALONE , if i had to do it over again , I WOULD NOT PURCHASE this phone.I also seem to be getting dropped calls . Again , never had that problem with my other cordless phones . Not sure why I am having that problem with this one . It does n't happen too often -- but i would say 5-10 % of the time . Again , this is UNACCEPTABLE if it is the phones fault . Since i have the same phone company and have been in the same house and never had this issue before , i suspect it is the phone.BOTTOM LINE : I would try another phone before trying this phone unless you HAVE to have the talking caller id . Many of the things that i put as positives can be found on any 6.0 phone . The sound quality of this is ok most of the time -- but for most of my life I have had phones that have had good sound quality ALL of the time -- so why compromise unless you have to . Unfortunately for me , I did n't problem solve the clarity issues fast enough to return the item so for now I am keeping mine . My sister has the VTECH phone and it is easier to use and sounds better . So if i had to do it over again I would probably start there.I want to clarify that probably about 80 % of the time the phone is clear and I do n't have problems hearing . It is not a constant problem -- -it is just that there are other phones out there that are clear 100 % of the time , so it seems smarter to try one of them first . I had many calls with panasonic support and read on the web to troubleshoot , I kept thinking i would find a way to fix it -- ( changing place of base station , making sure there was no interference ) -- and I had a huge family crisis so I did n't get it returned before the 30 days were up . So I ended up keeping the phone -- not the end of the world -- but I would rather have spent the same money on phones that worked 100 % of the time . i wrote this review hoping to help other people make a decision .	-1
We use netalk duo voice over IP for our phone service since it 's two bucks a month . We have an older Panasonic cordless phone that works fine with it but these newer phones had a huge latency and echo problem . Reading the reviews , apparently it 's a common issue if you are using VOIP . While they are feature rich and probably work fine with a hard line setup , they are useless for my purpose . Fortunately , Amazon is great about returns and so will now try a V-tech system since others have been happy with that on a VOIP system .	-1
I purchased the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone with 3-Handsets a month ago and find it is a basically decent phone , the sound quality is not that great , but it does have some nice features.One major issue I have is that although I was able to easily link the Panasonic handset to my Motorola and Blackberry cell phones , the calls seem to constantly drop , even though my cell phone may be only a few feet away from the handset or base unit . The call comes into either cell phone , transfers to the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone just like it is supposed to , but then about 90 % of the time , the Panasonic handset drops the call and says I missed the call . However , I have found that when this happens , I can grab either my blackberry or Motorola cell phone , depending which one was being called , and I can answer the call on that device . This seems really strange since I answered the call on the Panasonic unit only to have it drop the call yet find the call is still active on the cell phone that was being called . Both cell phones are relatively new and should be compatible with the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone.Since the main reason I decided to buy the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone over a few other brands I looked at was the stated ability to link it to a bluetooth enabled cell phone and this feature is not working correctly for me with neither of my two bluetooth enabled cell phones , I have to rate this product at no more than 2 stars . If I can figure out why this is happening and correct it , I will update this review with the solution.Update : Have not been able to fix the Panasonic dropping my cell phone calls . another thing users need to be aware of is the fact that this Panasonic phone can only store/chain up to 24 digits when programming a number . Trying to store my calling card access number and caller ID pin , I need to store a number that is 26 digits long , so another negative feature to this phone . My old AT & T ; base unit , which this Panasonic was to replace could store 26 digits , so I may need to go back to using that phone unit . Perhaps I will give this Panasonic unit away to a family member or friend who does n't need to store long phone number combinations or want to have it connect to a bluetooth enabled cell . I will leave the rating at a 2 stars since the unit does receive land line calls .	-1
I bought these to replace my Dect 6.0 Panasonic Cordless phone set with 4 handsets of which all 4 the headset jacks failed over less then 1 year . Now with this set one headset jack has failed within 4 days of use.These phones have much better audio quality then the older ones , yet it appears that the supplier of the headset jacks has gotten worse in the last year.In fact a friend of mine who also has Panasonic cordless phones just shared with me that they talked with Panasonic support and was told it could not be Panasonic 's fault . So rather then waste my time trying to get the service these , I will send them back and buy a set from Costco , so when they fail I can take them back and get a refund and buy yet another set.Such a big disappointment as Panasonic used to make the best phones and now it is really hit and miss.So I will buy more this type of products from Costco so I can return them when the fail prematurely.Happy Holidays ,	-1
I 've used a lot of Panasonic brand products over the last 20 years and I 've grown to appreciate their quality but this phone system left me disappointed . First of all , one of the four stations died within the first month I 've had the system . The remote that died was the one for my workshop but it does not matter anyway because the workshop was at the outskirts of the system range . I moved the base station to within 125 feet of my workshop , the signal must pass through two walls ( neither of which is metal ) but the phone still was intermittent and weak . My old 2-station Uniden that was also Dect 6.0 would reach out to the shop without a problem so it really seems like something is not too good about this Panasonic system . The quality of the sound on this Panasonic phone system is not very good either and it could certainly be louder . I bought a matching Panasonic headphone/mic to use with this system in my office since I spend a lot of time on the phone , whatever you do do n't get that accessory , the headphone sounds awful , it 's not loud enough and people complain that I sound distorted when I use the mic ( I 'll review the headphone separately , it would get zero stars if that was an option ) . If I had this to do over I 'd buy the Uniden instead .	-1
I was really excited after using this phone the first night . There 's a bug in it that has made me change the rating now that I 've used it a few days . If you do n't ever expect to have the situation I describe , you 'll love this phone and will give it 5 stars , like I did before I had a couple of days of lost calls.Description of the bug is as follows ... I use Google Voice to ring 2 cellphones and home phone all at the *exact* same time when people call my Google Voice number . The Panasonic can not handle it . When this happens , I pick up the phone and can hear the other person but they ca n't hear me . It 's a repetitive problem . I 've had multiple callers experience it . It 's definitely a glitch in the Panasonic . After testing this problem a number of ways , it 's specifically related to cell + landline ringing at once . The Panasonic handles 2 cell calls ringing at once without a problem . But the combination of cell + landline ringing at once fails.To resolve the call failures , I had to turn off the landline on my Google Voice so that only the cellphones ring . The reason I use Google voice is so I can answer all my calls on cell or home phone without needing to give people different phone numbers . Using this Panasonic fulfills the same kind of need , making home phone ring if cell is in range of the base station ( about 20 feet or so ) . But it also means all calls I now answer from Google Voice are using the cell minutes whereas they would just be on the landline if this phone did n't have the bug and I did n't have to change the settings in Google Voice.Having said that , this is the only real problem I can find . The phone directory is pretty basic too . But I did n't expect much from that . The rest of the features are decent to really cool.But let 's face it . This is a phone . It should be able to make and receive calls . When it ca n't handle incoming calls properly , then it fails in its primary purpose . I 'm not going to return it because what other product does what this does ? AT & T ; has a version . But the Panasonic is a slick package except for the one instance above - all your phones ringing at once . Probably rare for most people and they 'll love this phone .	-1
I bought these with the expectation that I would be able to see the entire Caller ID Name and Number displayed but that is not always the case if the name is longer than the display characters available . That seems to be the case more often than not . I would not buy it again . All the other functions work well however with good range and good sound quality .	-1
The KX-TG7645M does not have speed dial capability ! ! ! This is unheard of in this day and age . Amazon is making me pay for return shipping for this . Do n't buy this if you need speed dial by pressing one numeric button .	-1
The overall design and intent of this phone is solid . If you have a relative with hearing problems or other impairment , it ( or a similar alternative ) is worth considering.Oddly , the audio quality of the caller ID announce is so bad that it is unintelligible for those with normal hearing . It is surprising that audio quality is far worse than other phones marketed as mainstream products.One other design element to consider is that the phone is not well suited for wall mounting that exists in many US homes . It requires a separately purchased bracket that juts out so far as to look odd . Regardless of the merits of wall mounting in general , if you have an existing hole in the wall that needs to be covered , this phone may not be for your particular application .	-1
It is a pop-up Post-It note dispenser/paper weight - there 's no doubt about that . However , # 1 it 's just too big and takes up valuable desk space . The black gloss makes it look like a cheap piece of plastic ( I think the intent was to look like a river stone perhaps ? ) The other main issue is the loading mechanism . Currently use the square holders with a straight down spring loading mechanism . This one works by placing the notes into the top of the shape and then pushing down with a twist . I do n't know about anyone else , but the notes got bent and do not lay flat . I 'm loyal to the square ones until they improve this design .	-1
This pop up dispenser has a nice heft to it to keep it from sliding around on your desk and has a rubber grip on the bottom . The black sleek is very elegant and professional looking for any decor . However , it was extremely frustrating and difficult to set up . We tried for over 20 minutes each to get this dispenser to work correctly and we could not . When we finally inserted the post its , they were very hard to pop out . I would n't recommend this style dispenser .	-1
I used about 16 of these adhesive tabs to hang a long greeting card on a dry , painted surface . It was n't long before I noticed more than several of the tabs had come loose . I pushed them against the wall again , but to no avail.I could n't imagine hanging a poster with these without having the same effect . In all fairness , the wall is hot , as it faces an eastern exposure , but that should n't affect the adhesiveness . I 'll try them out with other items and surfaces and update this review , but I 've never been actually disappointed with a Scotch product 's quality until now .	-1
Revising my review to say that I would never use these again . After putting up a few light things around the house , I decided to take one down off the wall . I peeled it super-gently and the paint came right off with one of the tabs . Then another one fell off my door and also took the paint with it . Needless to say , I 'm really annoyed and now need to paint again . Back to Fun-Tac !	-1
I received these to review for the Amazon Vine program . We have recently repainted my sons bedroom and thought these would be great for him to re-hang his posters . The thought of not having little thumb tack holes all over the fresh walls was very appealing.Unfortunately within minutes of hanging the first poster fell . By the next morning , everything was on the floor . I can not recommend these for semi gloss painted walls . Perhaps on a flat paint they may work .	-1
These reusable tabs seem like they 'd be great for the office - home or work - but they fail in quite a spectacular fashion . I 've used them on several different items on various surfaces and the object has fallen 9/10 times . The first object was some postcard-type art prints that I have decorating my desk at home . To hang these , I used one tab on the back and secured it firmly , by pressing and wiggling , to the luan backing ( that fake wood-type backing they give you in the put together yourself sets ) and three out of the seven I hung up fell or partially fell . I also used it on a double sized postcard using two tabs and that fell , as well.At work I have used a single tab to hang a single sheet of paper to a metal wall and it has held wonderfully so far . I 've also tried to use these to hang up a small fabric decoration that I have at work to the same metal wall and that has fallen so many times that I switched back to using tape loops like I was before I got these.Seems like it would be a good product - it 's reusable , cleanable , and there 's plenty in a pack at 72 , but I believe there is a reason the picture on the front of the package is an action shot of paper streamers . Anything heavier than that would crash and burn !	-1
I loved how this worked in the beginning - it does n't hurt the paint nor the paper , and I could reuse them easily when I have to move the posters around.Well , that was great , until about a month later.I came into my classroom finding my posters ( smaller than the regular posters , only about 1/3 or 3/5 of a regular poster 's size , laminated ) fallen on the floor . This happened in a stretch of a week . I put them back onto the wall , and found the same thing again a few days later.I am not sure how these would work on a more shiny surface , such as a plastic or glass surface , but on a painted surface , it did n't last too long.On the bright side , I could move them onto my wooden and metal cabinets ... those did n't fall off .	-1
I own the Pebble tape dispenser in the same line and I love it . It looks gorgeous and works well . I reasoned that the post-it dispensers would be equally winning . I bought 3 , one for each office and one for home.They arrived and I thought I might have misread the listing since they seemed like seconds . The tops are all scratched up on all three . The cover piece ( lid ) does not secure so every time you pull out a note it shifts . There does not seem to be a way to `` lock '' the top in place.At the time I bought these they were offered by Amazon ( in the Prime program ) and were a lot less expensive . Now I see they are a third party vendor item . Regardless , I 'm disappointed . The only worse thing would have been paying more for them .	-1
The idea is great but every time I pull a sticky out , it falls apart . I finally through it out . Great idea but does n't work .	-1
i was hoping for a nice small elegant looking post it note dispenser . the thing is like a big clunky rock . too cheap to send back . i 'm not loving it . it works well however to dispense the post it notes . just not what i wanted .	-1
Since the GE phone I 've been using was on its last legs , and having had very good experiences with Motorola in the past , I jumped at the opportunity to test out theMotorola DECT 6.0 Enhanced Cordless Phone with 2 Handsets and Digital Answering System L702 . I have used several different brands of both corded and cordless phones through the years and usually have no difficulty learning how to use a new phone . This was the exception . Easily this is the worst phone I 've ever used , mainly because of the convoluted design of the functions.The only pro : - I liked the size and feel of the handsets with the rubberized edging , which make it easy to hold on to without fear it 'll slip out of my hand.Cons : - Number 2 handset would not hold its charge from day one , I 've done all the manual said to do in this circumstance to no avail . Number 1 handset would only hold its charge for approximately 48 hours with little or no use.- It 's hard to maneuver through the system . Some of the keys would n't work unless pushed 3-4 times , especially the up , down , left , and right keys , which are used often.- Transferring numbers from CID list to phone book was annoyingly difficult.- No shared phone book between the phones , so each number has to added to each phone separately . The same goes for deleting numbers off.- Dual functions on most of the keys make using the phone extremely difficult and confusing . If you get this , better keep the manual handy.- Both numbers on the Call List and Messages were too easily deleted due to the complicated process Motorola set up . Most of these were accidentally deleted because of this.- Can not screen calls , the messages can only be listened to after they 've been left.- No jack for a headset or ear buds.- Can not be mounted on a wall , table/desk set-up only.- Receiver ca n't stand up , they have to just lay there and rock.As I said before , I 'm no dummy when it comes to using new phones and expect there to be differences between phones that I have to get accustomed to , but this is ridiculous . I am so disappointed that Motorola has put out something this inferior . I 'm not exaggerating when I say I hate this phone . I would not recommend it at all . In the meantime , I ended up buyingPanasonic KX-TG6672B DECT 6.0 Corded/Cordless Phone with Digital Answering System , Black , 2 Handsets , which I have absolutely loved so far .	-1
Ouch ! I was just about to sit down to write a rave review . The product had been performing as advertised ( dropper applicator worked fine and cap was n't getting stuck ) . However , when I just now picked it up to give the bottle another glance , glue spilled all over a small portion of my fancy new dining room table and on my laptop . I wiped up most of it with a paper towel , which is now stuck to my thumb and several fingers . Unfortunately , we did't have any acetone in the house . ( might want to have some on standby if you 're going to use this product ! ) The glue leaked out the side of the bottle ... around one of the seams of the magic `` button '' on both sides that gives you that precision one drop at a time . I 'm sure it was a fluke ... a bad bottle , but given the fact that my table now has a big smudge mark of super glue on it , the return key on my MacBook has a low rise crater and my thumb and fingers are hurting from the pain ... I ca n't recommend it , although I 'm not selling my 3M stock ... at least not yet.One recommendation , keep the bottle upright when not in use and do n't squeeze the sides until you 're ready to use the dropper .	-1
As a vine reviewer I received this product free from Amazon to rate . I opened the product and put the cap on intending to use it soon.I left the room and when I got back I noticed the bottle had tipped over , I went to pick it up and it was stuck to my counter , I grabbed my knife to try to scrape it off the counter top and my fingers got stuck to the knife , it was very hard to get off . I moved the bottle and my fingers stuck to it . There was a puddle of this glue on my counter I do not know how that happened since I screwed the cap on tightly.I now have glue on three fingers including some brown wood from the knife . Some of the bottle is still stuck to my counter , I am very upset over this , the bottle is not stable it may need a larger base so it will not topple over so easily . Leaking glue can become a problem , the glue itself is just like any other super glue but to have a cap that is this faulty is dangerous.I am sorry , but the selling feature for this item is supposed to be the revolutionary Precision Applicator that does not leak or stick . Sorry it failed on all counts . I will be tossing this in the trash .	-1
These markers seem cool b/c they 're designed to write on fabric and not wash off-however , most sharpies do this already anyway ! The thing that is n't great about these is that they are fabric tipped , so they will not write on any smooth or glossy service , which forces you to get out the regular sharpies to do that job anyway , thus negating the need for these all together . They are fun for art projects like T-shirts or canvas shoes , but like I said , any sharpie can already do that , so after using these I was asking myself-what 's the point ? ! Do n't waste your money buying these , just buy a pack of regular permanent markers , which you can get in all the same neat colors that come in this kit !	-1
The colors are a bit more vibrant than regular sharpies but the brush tip smooshes easily and does not hold it 's shape . After only a few light uses the tips have spread out and are no longer able to be used for any detailed work . I would recommend getting regular sharpies in a couple of different tip sizes instead of buying these . They seem to be no more or less colorfast than the typical sharpie either so I do n't really see the value in these specialized markers . Regular sharpies will do the job just fine and other jobs as well .	-1
This comes without any phone cord hookup , therefore , I did not like it . I returned it for a refund . Would not recommend .	-1
It is a little unbelievable that all you can buy these days are cordless phones yet none of them are worth a hoot . They lose their charge , the replacement batteries cost more than a new unit . I 'm fed up with them , and I 'm going back to a corded phone . Not as convenient but I rarely use my home land line anyway but at least when I want to make or take a call it will work . I hate cordless phones - a real pain . Until manufacturers come up with a decent battery even with the charging cradles they do n't function well , I 'm not buying another one . Done !	-1
purchased our first set in january 2012 and took it back for a replacement in march 2012 ... have the same problem in both sets ... periodically when replacing the handset to the main base the power goes out ... have to pull the power plug from the wall outlet and plug it back in to get power to it again ... i called at & t today in regards to this problem ... they told me to use another wall outlet to see if it occurs again ... i will , but i had replaced another much older at & t set that was plugged into the same outlet without any issues ... i should have kept it ... other than this issue we like everything else about the phone set ... being we bought/replaced at the same local store it might have been a bad lot from the factory that is causing the shut off of the system ...	-1
If you 're using it in a garage or giant shed it 's a good idea . The battery drains when it is n't being used ... ..hmmmm fancy that . It 's uncomfortable to use and people always tell me they ca n't hear me . I have to keep it pressed up against my face to properly communicate .	-1
The buttons on this phone are *very* stiff . I have MS , and I only entered one contact into my phone before deciding to send it back and get a different phone , because I could tell it was going to be a nightmare for me to use on a daily basis.The two calls I made had good , clear sound . The directions for setting it up were good . If you want a basic , no frills phone , this will probably be good choice- unless you have hands that are painful ( like with arthritis or carpal tunnel ) or weak or if you have manual dexterity problems . I 've had many phones over the years and none of them , including V-tech phones , have ever had buttons as stiff as these are.Luckily , with Amazon 's good return policy I 'll have my money back in a few days .	-1
I 've had this mechanical pencil for months and have used it for notes , lectures , etc . The biggest drawback and negative to this mechanical pencil is there is no retractable tip like the Pentel Graph Gear 1000 . No retractable tip means not good for putting in pocket as the tip will poke and hurt . The eraser for this is really small . The pencil writes okay , nothing really amazing about this mechanical pencil .	-1
I read the mixed reviews on this chair and ordered it ... . I saved the box though and I 'm glad I did . Two weeks into the chair 's life , the foam is already feeling compressed and it has developed a distinct wobble and creak . Also I find that the lumbar support hits just a little high so I 'd like to get a chair with adjustable support.Overall this chair looks and feels really cheap and is not lasting , even with minimal ( 1-2 hours a day ) use by an average-sized person.Amazon , return on the way ... UPDATE 5/6/12 : Returning this chair is a pain as it is very difficult to get back into the original box . I ended up shipping it in two ! I ordered another chair from Amazon and LOVE it ... . here 's the link to it : Alera Elusion Series Mesh Mid-Back Multifunction Chair , BlackThis chair is much better built , much more cushioning , and does n't make all the creaks and groans that the LexMod made ... and the black plastic does n't rub off on my walls . Basically it 's a much nicer chair for a similar price .	-1
I have had a lot of problems with office chairs . I figured where the arms swing up I would no longer be tearing my pants pockets up on them by just raising them when I get in and out of the chair . I just wish a manufacturer would put a legitimite weight max like they do on ladders . The adjustment heights break down . I try to turn the adjustment knob and it ends up pitching the chair downward in one of the directions . I would have sent it back . No excuses only reasons and I wo n't give them here .	-1
I have had trouble with this printer since I received it 11/16/11 . First I could n't get it to print in color than the ink ran out in after about 3 weeks . it was the ink that was in the box with the printer . I purchased new ink and since it is n't Canon ink it does n't print everything or it says I am low or out of ink and they are new cartridge . I did call customer service in Dec. about about the color ( which was their ink ) and they could n't help . I got new ink . the printer only prints sometime and says it is low in ink or there is no ink . I called again and they said they could n't help this time because I was n't their ink . I told them I even had trouble with their ink too but since it was over 15 days they could n't or would n't help me help me . I DO N'T recommend this printer or company too anyone .	-1
( Effectively ) Not wireless for the Mac ( no clear instructions available ) Not good for large print jobs . Out feed and tray dump on floor every 15-20 pages.Scanner : GoodI have a Brother HL2270 that works really well . To connect it wirelessly on my home network I found a YouTube video that walked me through the process . OK . I 'm very happy . Use it wirelessly exclusively.I needed a second printer , so I bought the Brother HL-2280DW.Scanner : Good for the price , a little quirky at times , but more than useable.Printer : So far I & # 8217 ; ve only been able to print using a USB printing cable . Same quality as the 2270 . This printer will also print on 110 pound ( cover stock ) -- which is out of spec , I lick my finger and run it along the center top ( outside ) edge of the card stock in the drawer . This would be the closet part to you . ( use another source of moisture for non-personal use ) . Barely damp is enough for the roller to pick up the heavier paper . ( The 2270 won & # 8217 ; t do this , the card stock physically bumps into something and stops ( jams ) ) .Also if you write long documents , like scripts and manuscripts , this is also a bad choice , I just printed 100 pages , numbered and it dumped papers on the floor 5 times . Each time I had to careful reinsert 2-3 pages and watch for pagination . Even with the lid up the out feed tray and feed do not work for large jobs . This printer spills anything over about 15-20 pages onto the floor.Wireless this printer is a total bust . I & # 8217 ; ve just spent ( another ) two hours trying to figure out how to make it work with my Linksys Router . I did this before with the 2270 , from an amateur video I can no longer find . I set out to do this today because I thought it would be interesting . Didn & # 8217 ; t happen.This is completely unacceptable . Everything I & # 8217 ; ve found from Brother is overly complex and impossible to follow . I haven & # 8217 ; t been able to find an 800 number . They probably can & # 8217 ; t make it work either . The amateur help is either for Windows or it & # 8217 ; s useless . ( Thanks for trying ) .I have a low tolerance for this sort of thing . Huge corporations making all these amazing things , taking our money and then putting out manuals that are useless , and then relying on us to sort it out and help each other . The online help in general seems to be fragmenting and getting worse not better . I used to get all manner of free products at MacWorld because I would try it out , figure it out and share what I learned with others in articles and personally . I doubt that anyone who & # 8217 ; s made a really helpful video or instructions guide has even received a thank you . This is why the people who are effective at this usually only have a few videos.This printer is effectively NOT WIRELESS . Do not buy it if you have a Mac .	-1
I am very technically proficient in networking . Brother is not . I suggest anyone considering the MFC-7860DW read the one star reviews.Brother wants you use a USB cable between your computer and the Brother device to set up wireless initially . The software did not properly set up the wireless network using this method . I then attempted to use the front panel on the device to configure network settings . Unfortunately , the software/firmware on the device has problems because it would not permit inputting certain common characters used for network keys . The manual states those characters should appear by pressing specific buttons , but in the case of this unit , they did not . The manual is wrong and unreliable.Customer Services acts like you 're nuts in believing the problem has anything to do with the printer . `` Not our problem '' is Customer Service 's manta . `` Must be a router issue . '' `` Call your router company '' .Eventually , I was able to get the printer to work wirelessly only after dropping all firewall protection on my computer and the network . It worked once . After the printer went to sleep - which is does often - it never worked again.As I said before , Brother may be a great printer company , but they are a lousy networking company . If your IP address is 192.168.4.102 , the printer believes it 's 192.168.004.102 . Do you want your printer to work wirelessly ? Does that mean your computer is connected to the router via wireless , the printer is connected to the router via wireless , or both ? Most people have mixed networks , and the answer makes a huge difference.Brother never through about adding connectivity beyond the first computer . I assume most people get this printer for it 's wireless capability to use with multiple computers . However , the required software takes you through every single step each time you install it one a computer , even though your printer already has been set up to your router . Yep , not a networking company.Brother 's solution to everything is to delete all network settings and reconfigure them . This unit goes to sleep every 2 - 3 minutes . At that rate , I 'd reconfigure the network settings 480 times every day , 14,440 times every month , and over 172,000 times every year . Thanks , guys.Brother troubleshooting software also tries over and over again to get you to set the Brother printer as the default printer . The troubleshooting software even indicates your problems may be caused by the Brother not being the default . Ugh.Oh , and the machine is literally louder than my refrigerator compressor even when not in use.Stay clear if you run Win 7 on any machine .	-1
Small footprint , well integrated Ethernet access , large paper storage space , inexpensive ( compared to HP ) toner , and a document feeder , all at a very low price . In my past experience with Brother printers and fax machines they are extremely reliable and easy to setup and that is why I chose to go with a Brother . With a infrequently used copier the inkjet versions will clog and as the ink dries out in the print heads and they are a lot slower and in the long run a lot more expensive with the cost of consumables.Setup was fast and easy and the Nuance scanner software is great and an improvement over that provided with older models from Brother and the software from HP which is so bloated that it often fails to even install properly.Nice feature is the ability to register a PC by name when installing the software . Then when scanning a document you can select the destination computer from the Brother and push the scan to the desired PC . Very easy and very slick implementation and it works ! Nuance software also provides for scanning to the customary TIFF or JPEG formats but by default will scan and output a PDF file which is a real timesaver for scanning a document to email to someone . I would pay for the free Nuance software for this feature alone.Printing to the Brother MFC7360N wakes it out of sleep mode ( actuall `` deep sleep '' ) and outputs a page in seconds . It is roughly four times as fast as my HP 4000TN printer to output the first page . The Brother does suck up a lot of power when it comes out of sleep mode and the alarm goes off on the UPS that is on the same circuit . I suspect it probably should be on its own circuit or a 20amp circuit to avoid any problems with other devices.Scanning is very fast and with standard large images works as expected . With text pages though the borders have a shadow pattern on the page on both sides that is generated within the machine . For OCR or most images this is not going to be a problem but not great for making scans of text pages for electronic archival purposes . This problem only affects scans and does not happen when making a copy of the same printed page so it may be a problem with the Nuance software.It also is extremely noisy with a loud hum and loud fan noise when it is first turned on or after a page is printed . It goes into standard and then sleep and then deep sleep mode and the fan does not shut off until it reaches `` deep sleep '' . The MFC really needs to be in a separate room with a door you can close . Turning the unit on and not even printing or scanning it goes into standard mode and I timed how long it took for the fan to shut off . It takes a full 11 minutes before the machine goes into deep sleep mode and its very loud fan shuts off . Has to be a defect in the design as the cooling fan cycles even when the MFC7360N is first turned on and nothing has been printed . This could be fixed with a firmware upgrade but apparently Brother has not bothered to produce one.I paid $ 179.97 for this printer on August 24 , 2011 and a week later it is priced at $ 114.99 which , if you can put it in a separate room , makes this a good value with the low cost of the Brother consumables.The noise is loud and atypical of laser printers . Most recently I bought a Canon 4570dn all in one and after it prints a page it shuts down immediately and it is completely silent . The 11 minutes of fan noise from the majority of Brother laserjet printers is a fairly recent defect as I have had other laserjet printers from Brother that did not exhibit this behavior and were extremely reliable .	-1
I bought this sharpener for my high school science classroom and bought it based on prior reviews . Less than a month after purchasing it , it began to eat half the pencil before it was even sharp . When the pencil was & # 34 ; sharp & # 34 ; it was only a wooden point and had to be broken off to reveal the graphite ( regardless of the pencil being sharpened ) .	-1
The Belkin stand I tried from a friend before buying M Stand by Rain Design instead . Belkin stand does NOT have an angle to the keyboard that allows one to type on it while in the stand . You MUST use an accessory keyboard when using the Belkin ; M Stand can be used with access . keyboard , or one could use the keyboard on the laptop because it has a generous tilt/slant . See photos of each.Additionally , the M Stand is rock solid , better built . No flex , no give , even when typing . I did n't even consider the Belkin once I used it . For a few bucks more , the M Stand by Rain Design is worth every penny . It 's sublime -- but the Belkin is a weak imposter.There is a gentleman who reviewed Griffin stand , which is almost identical to Belkin ( same production company ? ) versus the M Stand in a utube video ( just search M Stand and it 's one of the top videos ) . He goes through the many disadvantages of this style stand versus its chief competitor , the M Stand . Check it out .	-1
There are many different perspectives one can take when reviewing an item . In this case mine is based on a stand I already have for my macbook - the rain design mstand . The mstand was purchased on amazon a few years back . It is a single piece of Aluminum that can hold up every macook book from the 11 inch air to the 17 inch macbook pro . The only issue I ever had with it is when using the air , I put something in front to act as a slight riser.I found some rubber sticky nubs worked perfectly.Recently I added another area of our house where the it would be convent to have a second laptop stand in our house and got this one to use . Boy was I disappointed , While I had no problems with my wife 's 11 inch air , the 15 inch macbook pro made it look like this stand was not as sturdy.So then I realized that this is same price as the rain design . So for the same money ... . there is NO WAY I would buy this . Just get the rain design and do n't look back .	-1
I think this is one of the worst printers that I have owned in terms of consuming ink . I hate the fact that it uses so much ink in so little time and that you can not print anything out if you have a full black ink and no color ink . This printer locks up even though want you would want to print is only black . Kodak used to be affordable at ten bucks a pop but I guess times change .	-1
I am a longtime user of HP printers . In fact , I still have one that I love because the ink lasts forever in it- and I 'm a frequent user . The cost is substantial to replace so I was pleased to find this Kodak printer that claimed the lowest cost in replacement ink.Pros : -It prints out crisp , clean images-It prints out photos with good clarity-The copier works fast and cleanly-The feed is smooth and handles most paper weights/types easily-The printer 's ink is among the cheapest for replacement-The wifi connection was so easy to install with my MacBook Air laptop-The cable connection to the iMac was easy to install as wellCons : -The ink gets used up very quickly . Ink may be cheaper , but you 'll be buying it more frequently.-The `` intelligent '' paper size sensor works well for some sizes but not others . ( See below for my explanation . ) -The wifi turns off after a period of no use and in order to use it again , you have to unplug the printer then plug it back in again.I tried to print out my sister 's wedding invitations on the printer . It was a 5.75 '' by 5.75 '' size paper and I changed all the settings on my computer that I needed to in order to print that particular size . However , the `` intelligent '' paper sensor insisted that I had not put in the correct size paper . It refused to recognize that paper at all and never pulled it through the feeder . It was frustrating and there was no help available with Kodak support for that question . ( My HP printer did recognize the paper and allowed me to print instead . ) The wifi turning off is also a little aggravating . I can understand if it would just go into `` sleep '' mode but it does n't sense when a print job is in queue . You should be able to press the on/off button to get it running again , however , not even that works . I find I have to disconnect the printer from the wall socket in order to resume the wifi use.Overall , it is a great start for Kodak . The printer leaves a fairly small footprint on my desk and is quieter than many other printers . It is very easy to set up with Macs ( which is always a plus for our family ! ) *********UPDATE*****************Since posting my review , I have discovered one other issue that ( for us ) is a deal breaker . Every time I turn on my computer to print , there is another Kodak update for the printer . When I click on it , it basically reinstalls the printer . I do not know what the `` update '' is . So we have decided to use this printer as a backup only and have gone back to using our HP printer.In addition , we purchased color & black ink cartridges 3x before using up even one ream of paper . The claim of being a lower cost ink printer does not hold up . That is why I am lowering my star rating from 4 to 2 .	-1
This does not work with windows professional 7 . Period . I got it to work Bluetooth with my MacBook air , but no way with windows 7 ... anyone have any ideas that will work ? As of 3 communications with HP , they ca n't get it to work..and no , it 's not the computer ... the Bluetooth works fine ...	-1
Ink jet printers are never trouble-free , but I 've had decent luck with HP in the past . I grabbed this while on a trip for work when I needed a printer for an unexpected project and it was n't realistic to do it at Kinkos.I have rarely been so disappointed by a product.The printer is portable , but it still large . I would n't recommend bringing this along when flying . It would fill 1/3 of a carry-on bag . It 's fine for car trips.There is no case included , and you really need one . A larger laptop briefcase is a decent fit.The power supply is a mess . It is typical of HP : a huge heavy brick with cables at either end . It is a terrible design for a portable device.The paper feed is n't very reliable . It likes to eat paper , and there is no access to help remove the shredded pages . A paper jam will take a lot of time to clear . 20 mins of removing tiny shreds of paper through the ink access door is no fun when trying to get work done.The Bluetooth printing does not work with iOS ( iPhone or iPad ) . It also is n't compatible with HP ePrint , so Chromebooks are nearly impossible unless you have another laptop to act as a print server.There is no wifi . Honestly , the best way to travel with this is to bring along an Airport Express.The bluetooth printing works fine with Mac OSX 10.9 , though setup took a couple tries ( hint : do n't try pairing it in bluetooth setup , just stare at the add-printer screen until it somehow will appear , eventually ) . You can only print one or two pages with bluetooth . If you print more than a couple of pages , the connection will drop and the print job will not complete . If you need multiple page documents , make sure you pack a USB cable ( not included ) .The best solution for traveling with this is to pair it with an Airport Express and USB cable . That will give you decent reliable connectivity without wires and it does n't add much more bulk to your bag than the stupid power brick included with this device.Battery operation works . I did n't try to run it dead so I ca n't speak to the `` 500 page '' battery claim . I would expect they base that on `` fast draft black and white '' printing , which would probably give you about 100 normal pages.The ink carts are a bit small and there are n't any `` xl '' carts available , so it wo n't be a super-cheap way to print on the road.Print quality is average for an ink jet . I would not use them for important customer presentations , but it is fine for interoffice documents ( invoices , working on drafts , memos , letters ) .I 'm actually going to keep it . I bought it at Best Buy and do n't want to deal with their CS nightmare to try to return due to lack of satisfaction . I 'll keep it in the car for emergency print needs on the road.I would not recommend it unless you have no other choice . I 'm not sure there are any better alternatives , and I 've looked for one . HP could make this a lot better by putting the power supply in the body , including a custom bag , and adding wifi/ePrint . This model is basically an antiquated ( think 1998 ) compact inkjet with a battery slapped on the back .	-1
This is a disgraceful product . HP 's printers were once the acme of quality . The cost-cutting of the Mark Hurd CEO era has made them a brand to avoid.I wo n't list all this printer 's problems . Just read the many other one-star reviews . The paper feed is unreliable . The Bluetooth does not work . The on-off power switch fails frequently ... My final straw was the print overflow tray reporting it was full which blocks ALL printing . After finally locating the part -- a challenge in itself -- the cost was $ 15 plus $ 11 shipping ( it is tiny and weighs less than 4 ounces ) , the replacement does n't work , leaving the printer useless . I should have junked it a month after buying it , but it is expensive and I was reluctant to admit to wasting the money . I threw it out -- a dreadful piece of overpriced , badly made , unreliable junk.Avoid , avoid , avoid .	-1
These shapes do not functionally stick to anything . I tried them on my fridge to hold up a postcard . The shapes will stick at first , but they peel off within an hour or so . They will not hold up anything more than a few minutes . I tried it on the wall , and it fell off quickly . These do not work at all as intended .	-1
I had high hopes for these reusable stickers : alternative to magnets on the refrigerator , hang artwork on walls or windows . My package contained 18 pink reusable shapes ( circle , heart , star ) and my kids quickly found some items that we wanted to hang . The package says they 'll hold up to 3/4 lb , but after a week only 1 of our photographs is still sticking to the refrigerator . Two photographs ( matted on heavy duty construction paper ) fell off the fridge every hour . I put them on a window but they also failed to stick ( even with 4 stickers ) . I must admit that I ( and my kids ) quickly lost interest in these , but after reading some other reviews I may try some other surfaces.These have been mostly a novelty in my household . Very cute . But I 'm a little underwhelmed and surprised that they did not work better .	-1
I was excited to try these out ; unfortunately , as cute as they are , they simply are n't functional . I used 8 of them to hang up a small picture ( 8 x 11 ) , that had a light mat underneath it ( definitely weighing less than the 3/4 pound indicated , no frame ) . They worked great at first , but two days later the picture fell off the wall . They did n't leave any residue on the wall , so that 's a good thing , but beyond the cuteness and lack of residue , I ca n't recommend this product .	-1
i thought these would be great for sticking flyers to my business ' front glass door , but the first time i went to replace the flyer and reuse the stickers , the paper tore off and stuck to them . it was difficult to peel the paper off the stickers . great idea , but did n't work so well in practice .	-1
Original Review : Well , these are cool . I stuck a piece of note paper to a mirror and it works great . I 've peeled it off both the mirror and the paper several times with no problem . Did n't leave any residue behind , but it was n't on the mirror for very long . The directions say to put the shapes on the back of the item you want to stick up , but I do n't see why they could n't be put on the front if the item is n't too thick.July 10 , 2011 : I pried the stickables off of the microwave . Yes , pried . They were really stuck , but they came off of the paper with no problem.October 31 , 2011Yes , these stick very well , but they collect dust and pet hair like crazy . I did n't remove the top protector on them and they 're still a mess . And what do you do with them when you 're not using them ? I put them back on the sheet with the unused ones , but it 's a pain . Use magnets when you can and painter 's tape when you ca n't .	-1
I 'm not at all fond of products that people really do n't need . Scotch Restickable Shapes is an item you wo n't need if you have refrigerator magnets , Post-Its , or simple , old-fashioned tape.The gimmick here is that you get 18 assorted shapes in three color choices -- blue , pink , or orange -- which can be used for mounting pictures , photos , messages , notes , children 's art work , etc . The stickers can be placed either on the front or the back ( the shapes have double-sided adhesive ) of the item to be mounted . They adhere to practically all flat surfaces , including stainless steel , plastic , concrete , glass , wood , or painted walls.I suppose kids will enjoy the novelty and pizzazz of using these colorful objects to display their drawings , poems , report cards , award certificates , and commendations in common areas of the household for all to see . They 're not that expensive , so if you want your child to have some fun putting up his/her work , these shapes should do the trick.They 're also a wall-safe alternative to thumb tacks or nails , since the mounting tabs can be removed without harm to either the wall or the object itself . They 're economical , since they 're reusable . However , with repeated use , the adhesive will weaken and they will not remain reliable.For adults , they 're an elaborate way to do a simple job and , in fact , tend to be too large and cumbersome .	-1
They are kind of cheap looking but they are colored pens so they do the job.If you go through pens a lot then I would recommend these !	-1
It 'd be nice if they were all WRITE , too . When I got these pens , I did n't know what to expect . Were they gel pens ? Were they regular ballpoints ? I still do n't know . The ink colors are easy to see and the pen writes very smoothly -- when it writes . Sometimes the ink does n't come out right away , which can make for a messy look . So far I have n't had the kind of ink clots that were produced by the first gel pens I used , probably in the late '90s , so that , at least , is an improvement and a nice surprise . I still wish the pens wrote immediately and consistently , though.Update , 2/20/13 : I do n't recommend the pens . A few of ours have gotten so clogged that pushing the button does n't bring the tips in or out anymore -- they are stuck . It takes cleaning just to be able to write with the pens , which seems like unnecessary aggravation . Apparently they are gel pens , and apparently gel pens have not come very far since the '90s .	-1
Straight out of the package , the green pen was clogged with leaked , dried up gobs of ink . Even after cleaning it , the button sticks bad every time I try to use it , though it does still write , it usually leaves a big dark mark wherever you start and/or stop writing with it , as do several of the others . When the pens that work right do , their lines are thin , faint , and occasionally spotty . They are n't worthless once you get the hang of them , but they sure are n't anything special . I 'd go with another brand .	-1
Okay Paper Mate has designed a better looking , light , well balanced pen casing , but they have not improved on the most important feature , the ballpoint . IT STILL BLEEDS . The ink is smoother , colors are vivid , but that ballpoint tip still ca n't hold it in , it BBBBBLLLLEEEEEDDDDDSSSSSS ... ... ... ... ...	-1
These pens were cheap and appropriately priced . They collect ink on the tip , and deposit it randomly as you write . Any cheap BIC is better .	-1
It is fine if you must have some pens in these colors . But the quality is poor . The writing is not smooth , and the lines that you make are not solid and uniform . Just exactly the kind of result on paper you would expect from a cheap pen .	-1
I was really excited to get a nice pack of pens for a really great price with a good variety of colors . They come out of the package with wax/rubber on the tip , so you are assured they are not dried out . For the price , this definitely can not be beat . You will not find a product anywhere else for this quality.That said , I was not overly impressed by the quality of ink per say . Its ink , just ink . Its not bad ink , just ink . Nothing impressive to write home about it ( pun intended ) .Would I buy these pens again , yes . Are they my favorite pens , no.Edit : Everything above this was my original review , but here is my update . I hate these pens . They constantly leak . I have some at home , 2 in my purse , and a couple in my backpack ( I am in nursing school . ) And every single one of them has leaked . The first few , I thought were to my fault so I would take the pen apart , clean the inside and put it back together . But the orange and pink pens I have never used and they have also leaked ! I have given up and have decided to throw the whole set in the trash . I do n't want anything else to be ruined . I would give these pens zero stars if I could .	-1
I like colorful pens . I use color to keep my various tasks straight . These pens are great colors , but they are all too light to read easily on white paper . On yellow legal pads , even the & # 34 ; standard & # 34 ; colors seemed light .	-1
I love Paper Mate products and almost exclusively use their pens . I was very excited to hear about the Inkjoy line ( the name alone made me smile ! ) . Unfortunately the 300RT pens have been a major disappointment . First the good : ( 1 ) the colored inks are quite nice and ( 2 ) um ... that 's about it . The problem is that pens have had serious problems with smudging and leaking . Almost half of the pens from my 8-pack almost immediately started leaking so severely that it 's difficult for the pen to retract . To use these pens , I have to clean the nib , which is covered in goo , and then I still have issues with smudging ( I eventually threw away the offenders ) . The pens are also not very attractive , with a totally straight barrel and a rather odd-looking clip.Instead of these pens , I highly recommend the Paper Mate Profiles , which come in the same colors and with which I have never had any problems with leaking or smudging . The Profiles are also better looking and more comfortable . From reading through other reviews , I see that not all customers have had issues with pens leaking ; however , half of my 300RT pens have leaked , and I never had any of my dozens of Profile pen leak .	-1
I got these because I like to balance my checkbook with a different color ever month . I was in the market to expand on the color I used as new colors have come about . I found highliters the same rainbow colors , red ink/pink highliter , black ink/yellow highliter , pink ink/pink highliter , green ink/green highliter , purple ink/purple highliter , orange ink/orange highliter , blue ink/blue highliter . I was all set . Then , within days of being in the canister , the green ink exploded twice , just like the cheap old pens of yester year . If you 're not old enough , you may not remember it . I got rid of all of them , I do n't like exploding pens , a waste of money ! I searched for rainbow colors and found them in Pilot G2 and got them . I 've used Pilot G2 Gel pens for years for checks as they ca n't fraudulently wash off your signature and the amount . I use highliters for debits that have n't cleared , so I want to have a different color to keep it all straight . I can keep the color straight by singing the rainbow song in my head . If you want colors and you do n't mind ink on your hands and cloths , these are fine . However , if you want serviceable pens , do n't buy these .	-1
While the gel pad on the top is comfy for the feet , as soon as I opened the box I noticed it was not attached on the front half of the foot rest . I ca n't believe I had to break out the super glue for a brand new product straight out of the box . I should have learned from the last one I owned . The prior model of this broke with in 4 months it snapped in half , the plastic was so weak . I have serious doubts that this one will be any better given that the gel pad was falling off as soon as I opened the box . We shall see I guess ! ! ! !	-1
I was really disappointed in these stickies . The main thing that 's disappointing is how much they curl . It 's so extreme that they 're practically unusable.My team probably has a more extreme use case for sticky notes than most people so take what I have to say about these stickies with a grain of salt . We do scrum for project management , which involves writing tasks on sticky notes and posting them on a wall ( it 's a glass wall ) in the hallway . Each sticky note is probably stuck to the wall , starting from when written , an average of 4-6 times . Also , it 's a hallway so there 's plenty of people breezing by the stickies.While they do n't fall down on the ground significantly more often than the leading competitor , they curl at such a great angle from the wall that they 're harder to read and just look odd . It bothers other people on the team , as well . Also odd , they 're really stuck to the pad so it takes quite a bit of pull to remove them from the pad . That may not seem like such a big deal , but when you 're writing up 20 stickies at a time it gets frustrating.I definitely would n't buy these again - I 'm going back to the leading brand .	-1
When you buy the `` other brand '' , you usually do so for the cost . That 's why it surprised me that they are currently more expensive when the closest product is compared Amazon to Amazon ( price per sheet ) . To me , that means that the product should preform just as well or better . ( Price compared with : Post-it Notes , Original Pad , 3 Inches x 3 Inches , Recycled , Assorted Pastel , 75 Sheets per Pad , Six Pads per Pack ( 5416-RP-AP ) ) Unfortunately , they 're just not as good . And it 's the stickability that is the problem ! The stickiness itself is fine , but the paper curl is much worse than on a Post-It Note . This means that after you stick them , the stuck part curls and then they come off . It can take a minute or they may have fallen by morning , but they do ! I thought I just did n't press enough at first , but the same problem exists even if I make sure to rub across the sticky part a couple times . I then tried to pull the sticky notes off different to make them curl less . I quickly decided that even if possible -- I do n't want to spend my time being careful how I pull a sticky note off a pad ! This matters most if stuck vertically . They stay ok when stuck horizontally ( but still curl ) . Post-It notes do curl when you pull them off the pad , but the stickyness overcomes the curl when stuck . You may be ok if you only post in books . I leave notes on fridges , monitors , phones and more -- and I can trust the Post-It brand to stay where I put them ! Most things are just as good . The colors are great . You can write on them easily . They stick without leaving any marks . They are easily removed . But that does n't matter much when they fail the most important test -- staying stuck ! I give this just two stars because they do n't seem ready for prime time : -I wo n't use this brand , and I use Post-It Notes every day-I would n't suggest the product to others-They fail most in the versatility which is exactly why I use the other notes.added 7/13 : I was using the blue ones through my whole review testing . Last night I started using the purple ones . 2 out of 3 purple ones stayed stuck overnight . That 's still a one third fall rate , and all of the purple ones still did curl . Either their paper consistency is n't there or perhaps their 's something in the blue dye that makes the curl worse -- I dunno .	-1
These are simple enough - supposed to be like Post-It notes . Well , they are not . They are too sticky and leave a residue wherever I apply them.Stay with the name brand ... these are n't worth it .	-1
I thought I 'd give these Avery Sticky Notes a try over the other brand , thinking `` how different could a sticky note be ? `` Turns out , quite different . The first thing I noticed is that you can actually see the adhesive on the note . It 's either residue on the next note left after you remove the top note , or the adhesive is just coming through the back of the note to the front . So the notes appear to have a two-tone color to them , where the top quarter of the note is a different color.They seem to require a lot more force to remove the top-most note from the pad . The adhesive seems to hold the pads together quite well.However , I suspect that some of the adhesive is left on the next note . Why ? They do n't stick well on many surfaces . I recently tried these out before going away , by leaving notes on certain doors and surfaces , since somebody who was stopping by to check on things . Within 30 minutes , several of the notes fell to the floor . I had to add a strip of tape to the notes to keep them in place . This defeats their intended purpose.If you remove a note from the pad , the corners at the adhesive turn-up dramatically . I think this keeps the notes from remaining attached to the intended surfaces . The paper will curl-away , and eventually the note will fall to the floor.I 'll only use these for writing notes to myself or for attaching them to other papers , where they seem to adhere well . For other purposes , I would n't rely on them . If you leave a note for somebody , it will probably fall to the floor and end up missed .	-1
I just ca n't figure out why these notes would be transparent . You can see through aobut 5 of them but why would you use them ? they do n't tear either so when you throw them out and if you have personal info on them , you would have to shred them.the writing surface is smooth for writing and it does n't smear.i just ca n't figure out why someone would need them .	-1
A see-through sticky note is a great product concept . Using something like this would allow users to write comments about something underneath , while it would be unnecessary to remove the note to see what is underneath as well.That being said , I thought the execution of the concept here was only fair to poor . First , the `` paper '' is like vellum ( sort of like thin plastic ) which I personally do n't care for when looking for something to write upon . Second , the adhesive picked up pencil writing on a page that I stuck a note to when I was trying them out . Third , although pencil and regular ink do not rub off the surface of the note , gel pen rubs off easily which could make a mess using these in a book . Fourth , it is easy to see through the note when it is stuck to a page , but the yellow color might distort the color of something underneath which might be an issue for some uses - I did not actually try these notes out on a page with color illustrations , but it seems a likely problem there so I mention it.As I said , great concept , but only fair to poor execution .	-1
These are advertised as `` see through '' yellow sticky notes . I was disappointed , because they are n't really see through at all -- and in the description , it calls them `` transparent . '' Believe me , it 's anything but . In fact , they are barely translucent . Just yellow , very slick plastic like paper that can be difficult to write on . So because you ca n't see `` thru '' them - I 'm not sure why they are calling them that . I would not recommend them for that purpose .	-1
Cool , you can stick these plastic yellow notes on something and still see what is underneath . I thought it would be perfect for my wife who has a thing for sealable plastic storage bags , which she loves because you do n't have to open them to see what 's inside . After the slight `` wow '' factor , these notes do n't seem like such a wonderful idea after all . First , almost anything you post them to is going to be substantially larger than the note , so it is stil easy to see what 's under the note . Second , since you can see through the note , what you write on it becomes harder to read if you post it on top of anything with words or even patterns . Why make notes that are harder to read ? I 'm already confused enough.Third , its small but its plastic . Should I be peeling it off before tossing the paper I stuck it to into the recycling bin ? With paper sticky notes there is no such problem . Last , the surface is very slick , so do n't use a pen that delivers lots of ink or it will smear . All that said , the product does exactly what Avery says it does . It is transparent , writable and removable . If that rocks your boat , go for it . Otherwise , go with the standardPost-it Original Notes , 3 x 3 Inches , Canary Yellow , 100-Sheet Pads ( 12 Pads per Pack ) ( 654-YW ) . Sorry Avery .	-1
These translucent sticky notes seem really interesting . However , you ca n't write on them with a pen as it will smear . They are made of a think plastic like material . This means you have to find a pencil to use them . Therefore , not that handy.If you only use pencils then maybe these are OK . Otherwise , they are just bookmarks .	-1
So , these sticky notes sounded great in concept . They are made of a see-through material so that you can stick them on a page and still see the text underneath . However , in reality , they did not work for me . First , they are 3 '' x3 '' , so any comments you want to make about the text below needs to fit within the 3 '' x3 '' area . Rarely do I have the need to make editorial comments where writing them over a 3 '' x3 '' area will work . Often , I need to make a single word change or change large parts of a sentence , neither of which work great with this product . A single word change was too small for this product and wasted it , and a sentence edit stretched too far to fit on a single sheet . Second , they are made out of plastic . They do n't erase well with pencil ( pencil actually smears ) , so you are stuck with ink ( some of which also smear if they do n't dry fast enough , such as some brands of gel pens ) . You ca n't recycle them , so you are now using one piece of plastic and then tossing it in the trash . Maybe for others this product will work , but for the type of normal text editing I do , they just did n't work out that great .	-1
In the past I have used other products made by Avery . I have been completely satisfied until now . I do not like the sticky notes . They do not stick to objects like 3M post its . I liked the idea that the paper is recycled . The pastel colors were nice too . However , I do not recommend them . :0 (	-1
I am always posting notes everywhere , so I was glad to try these out for the Amazon Vine customer review program . Normally , I purchase Post-Its , so I was curious to see if these were any better . On the plus side , these recycled paper notes do n't have the rough texture that recycled paper products usually have , which makes it difficult to write on with an ink pen . I did not have to retrace any letters while writing on these . The reason that I will return to buying Post-Its , however , is that these notes are not sticky . Within minutes of posting a note in my kitchen , the corners began to lift off . I do n't have confidence that it will stay up for long . At about the same price as Post-Its , these are not worth buying . If you want to be green , get the Post-Its with plant-based adhesives ( a product I recently reviewed favorably ) .	-1
I did n't find much difference between these `` new '' sticky notes than the regular sticky notes , other than these are somewhat more transparent , but not enough to easily read what 's behind them . I do n't see any advantage in buying these over the regular ones .	-1
Avery perforated sticky notes confuse me . Why do you need them to be perforated ? Seems to me that if you want a piece of paper that is not a sticky note to write on , then do n't waste your money on these perforated sticky notes only to use them as a regular piece of scrap paper . I do n't get it .	-1
I 'm generally a big sticky-note user and fan of all types of note . I figured the perforation on these would be another interesting and useful feature . However , I quickly discovered that the tear-off was rarely if ever an asset . Most of the time , if I want to remind myself of something , I just stick the note onto whatever it is that I need to remember . For instance , if it 's a book I need to return , the note gets stuck on the cover , or if it 's groceries , it goes on the fridge . When I want to take the note off , I just , you know , peel it off . Having a tear away strip did absolutely nothing for this functionality since I really do n't want to leave little half-notes all over the place , and being the forgetful person I am , that 's what happened.The other possible use I thought of was sticking them in as book markers , but the problem then is that unlike `` flags '' there 's not a little tab that sticks up . You just tore off your note ; now you have a place marker that does n't even stick out of the book to remind you it 's there , and you sure are n't going to want to scribble tiny little notes on the half note left stuck there.So , the question with these really became : `` when am I going to want to leave a tiny strip of sticky paper somewhere ? '' So far , the answer has been `` never . ''	-1
We tried these at our office and several people used them . The result ... not very good . Every single person went back to using 3-M Post-It notes . Sorry , but it was n't just me .	-1
This cube of sticky notes is attractive to the eye but the adhesive on the notes is not sticky enough . I will be leaving these notes by the phone in my office and using something else when I want a note that sticks .	-1
These are your standard sticky notes in a large assorted colored pad ( exactly as shown in picture ) . The one thing that distinguishes them from other sticky note pads that I have used is that the pad is held together not only by the glue on each note but also by a glue binding . I really like that feature because it is harder to accidentally pull the pad apart . My problem with this pad is that the adhesive is weak and once a sheet is pulled off the note does not stick down well and the corners both start pulling up within a matter of seconds . I would not purchase these for that reason alone .	-1
That pretty much says it all . For sticky notes these are not very sticky . They sorta stick the first time you put one on , somethings . Some of , , well , , , a lot of the places that the `` Post-it Notes '' stick , these wo n't stick at all . And if you pull it off and try to stick it someplace else , good luck . You may as well get out the tape . Another thing is the surface of the paper . It has a 3/4 '' wide band at the top that 's slick enough that my favorite Cross Pen does n't like to write on it and the rest of the paper is almost as slick making my pen want to skip when writing on it . Part of it could be my pen since it is a bit picky about what it will write on but if one does it others probably will too . But the bigger negative on these is that they just do n't stick very well , so as a sticky note they are not doing what they are supposed to be made for . Sorry Avery , these just do n't work like they should .	-1
These are n't as good as the other sticky notes I use , these do n't stick as well and want to fall off , I have to use tape to make them stay . This kind of defeats the purpose of having sticky notes if you must use tape to keep them stuck in place . I really thought avery would be better than this , I like their other products and the stickiness of the other products .	-1
I work with kids , so the bold colors are a bonus and the kids really love them.Big negative with this product though - the sticky part of the post it is barely sticky at all ! It does n't adhere to most surfaces , so it really is a big bust . When it does adhere , it peels off after a short time frame .	-1
At first , I thought they were as good as Post-It stickies ; however , the only similarity is that they come in stacks ( this one a large one , which , for me , was very convenient . ) Sadly , they are n't that sticky . I post Post-Its usually on my computer to remind me of things . With this product , you get what you pay for ... .it 's a bit cheap . My stickies do n't stay on long ( I think a few days was the max that ONE stayed on , ) but mostly they do n't last that long . The stickyness wears off FAST . With Post-Its , I can re-stick them and they will stick and stay ; with these , it does n't work . I had a small pile by my keyboard from all of the stickies on my computer that keep falling off . As of late , I have to pretty much use tape to keep them on the computer , and on the desk - which is the other place where I keep them ; however , knowing I do n't want tape on my desk , I try to weight them down with something.These are rather disappointing . : (	-1
I love the bright , almost neon colors , on these Sticky Notes . Unfortunately , in a side-by-side challenge for `` stickiness '' with regular Post-it Notes , the Post-it note win , hands down . Oh , these will stay on a flat wall , but only if you do n't accidentally brush against them . I suspect a good , stiff breeze would also dislodge the Avery Sticky Note . Unfortunately , an accidental bump ( a light one at that ) sent my Avery note flying . Of course , with the bright colors , it 's easy to find it after the paper has fallen to the floor , but I prefer the boring yellow Post-it Notes that stay where I put them until *I* want to remove them . I 'll stick with Post-it Notes .	-1
**** Edited 7-22-11 I initially was pleased with these Sticky Notes , until summer arrived . The thing is , they are not `` sticking '' very well and continually fall down from where I have stuck them . I would guess the summer heat may be to blame , but they should work regardless of the season . After discovering this , I lowered my score by 2 stars , from 4 to 2 . I DO live in a hot area of Southern California and rarely use the AC.See original review below : To review the Avery Sticky Notes 400 sheet cube I am comparing it to my old standby Post It 's . First off , the Sticky Notes are just a bit smaller in size , not quite as long from top to bottom . Also , unlike Post It 's multi pack with separate pads , the Sticky Notes need to be manually separated by color if you want to use multiple colors as they are all stuck together in one big clump . NO big deal but you do need to take the time to put them apart at strategic locations if you want to use the yellow or red or green before running out of the blue color on top.The thickness of the paper seems right in line with a Post It but the glue itself seems a little bit less . I was able to stick and remove the Sticky Note sheet 10 times with no trouble getting it to stick again each time . That should be fine for anyone 's use . Basically we are down to price and right now the Post It 's give you 50 more sheets and cost a bit less than the Sticky Notes . On the other hand , you do get one more color to choose from with the Sticky Notes . As you can tell , I am really on the fence between the two products as far as the quality and usefulness , but if price were your # 1 concern then watch for sales on both brands as either would do nicely .	-1
Although I no longer have sticky notes pasted around my monitor , I do use them to quick reminder notes . I probably most often use the little note pages to list all the places I need to go when I make my trek into town . I like to attach my list to the dashboard for a quick glance while I 'm driving.It 's a good thing I tried the Avery Sticky Notes in bold colors , it was easier to find it when it fell on the floor . But the dash board was n't the only place these little squares did n't stick . They fell off my desk , where I like to line up sticky notes for my to-do list . And they did n't stick to paper as well as I 've become accustomed to.All is not lost . Children enjoy drawing pictures and writing little notes on small squares , and these will do the trick . Since kids do n't expect their notes to stay put long , the fact that these do n't stick well wo n't matter . Kids will love the bright colors.I use other Avery products , including full-sheet adhesive pages to make stickers . I like the quality of the paper used and the `` sticky '' of the labels . So I was disappointed that these notes did n't quite measure up to the same standard . While I did n't expect the notes to stick forever , I do like them to stick for a day or two , at least .	-1
I read , and placemark books and files A LOT . Pagemarkers have been a staple item for years . These particular ones have pros and cons : Pros:1 . Nice bright pastel colors that are easy to spot.2 . Matte finish that is easy to write on with any type pen or pencil.3 . These appear to have a good price relative to the others available ( but see below ) .Cons:1 . Very thin , thus easy to tear , on the upside unlikely to tear the page itself.2 . Not very sticky , which can be a pain when the book is used often and they fall off.3 . Do not retain their stickiness . This a big downside , since I often move markers to new positions . These will not stick twice , so no re-organizing.4 . I love Amazon , but it may not be the place to buy small office supplies . Unless you are buying one incredible amount of stickers , the shipping costs are very high per sticker.In sum , these may be OK when used for archival materials that are rarely used or when used on delicate pages . But they do not appear adequate for heavy reference use .	-1
These really do not work at all . First , I wrote on one and stuck it to my computer monitor . Within an hour it fell off . The key thing you want from a sticky note is for it to stay stuck when you put it somewhere . These are failing on the `` stickiness '' test.Second , the colors are too dark , and when you write on them with a blue or black pen , the contrast comes out low , and what you wrote does not show up well.Overall , this product is pretty useless for me . I like the original Avery much better . . . they stick better , and have better colors .	-1
The requirement for sticky notes are that they are easy to write on and they stick . The plastic-like ridged material reequires a little extra pressure with a normal pen . No big deal . So , the writing is ok.The stickiness is not so great . The way I would use the notes is to have them hang a bit out of the pages of a book , so I can jump directly to the page and see the note . I found that with a very gentle tug , the note comes right off the page and out of the book.I do n't see any benefit to the shape or the transparency of these notes , so I 'm going to stick with the small rectangular notes .	-1
These notes function as your standard post-it , unless you need the note without the sticky top and then you can use the perforate feature to detach it . For me that is a infrequently needed feature , so I generally use these as I would any other post it . That makes its most noted feature not very useful for me . I tend to lose the notes without the sticky portion .	-1
Truth is , I really have n't found a good use for these perforated sheets yet . I love the size , and it is just right for longer notes & shopping lists . But why the tear off ? I just do n't get it . Perhaps I do n't have a good use for them.Regardless , the sticky portion of this note is less than satisfying . The sticky portion of that other major brand is much better -- sticks better , stays longer , and does n't get gummy . Because the adhesive is so bad , maybe that 's why there is a tearoff.I like the color , though . Add one star for that .	-1
The installation : With the chips , technically , the printer wo n't recognize this is not a Canon print head . However , after two days of replacement , I began to see error u052 . The printer refused to recognize either my old original ink heads nor this ink set you are watching . I switched them and tried different combinations , printer wo n't work . Here 's my solution , it might not be universal : turn off the printer and turn on . Before the system completely loaded , open the ink cartridge cover . Wait the screen displays a message says you opened the cover . Then Release the cover , the printer should come back . During a few minites of initiallation , my printer was shouting.. I believe the sound is different from using the original ink . After installed , I printed a couple of pages and pictures.The print quality : B & W ; : B & W ; pages are just okay . Compare with the original Canon ink , it 's less solid , less sharp and less black . Feel like water in it . It does the job though ! for the price ! Colors : colors are completely messed up . They probably used the wrong tag ! the red and blue are switched ! sometimes it gives me red hair ... like half red half black and the rest of them are rainbow color ... All I got are funny colored pictures and photos . The photos printed by using this ink I call them - TRASH ! None of them is even OK , and the photos are not sharp at all ! Plus the wrong color makes it much worse ! Overall : The packege is decent and it works for B & W ; pages . However , do n't dream about color printing ... it wo n't do it.if the colors worked I would give a two or three stars because the colors are not good . I should refill it by other good inks.Moreover , I believe the ink will damage my printer because the terrible quality . However , after a refill I believe it 's gon na be OK.I would recommend it if refill is ready . The pigment is just too bad . According to another reviewer , the wrong tag problem might not be universal , take your chance ? Not recommend to most Canon users , the OEM ink head is perfect ( and expensive ) . The decision is yours .	-1
There is little to distinguish this paper from any other quality paper from GP , Hammermill , IP , HP or any other mill . They all work hard to provide a quality paper from sustainable sources , and are made in the US or Canada.This paper does what it says it does . It works nicely in all of our printers : an HP ink jet , an HP laser , and an OKI led `` laser '' printer . The paper feeds smoothly and prints cleanly . 92 bright shows the colors well . If you want a good 24 lb paper you ca n't go wrong with this one.For my money , though , I would continue to buy 20 lb rather than this 24 lb variety . At the time of this writing I can buy five reams of 20 lbGP Copy & Print Paperwith the same 92 brightness ( 2500 sheets ) for about the same money as three reams of this.UPDATE 3/2/2013I serviced paper mills as part of my job and paper mills have a distinct odor due to the raw pulp being processed.After running a large job through my Okidata laser printer using this paper , I have to lower my rating from 4 stars to 2 . While the paper fed smoothly , when the paper comes out of the printer it has that distinctive raw pulp odor while the sheets are still warm . The odor quickly dissipates once the paper cools , but no other paper I have run though this printer in over six years has given off any order.Bottom line : I would not buy this paper .	-1
Guess you get what you pay for ; I thought there could n't be all that much difference in copy paper but I was sadly mistaken . This stuff sticks together , jams all the time and no matter how many times I leaf through it before putting it in the copier or printer , it sticks together and wastes the job . Going back to spend a little more on better quality . Think I 'll line the kitty tray with the rest of this .	-1
I 'd had poor luck with 2nd-party ink in the past , but was encouraged by all of the positive reviews here for this product . Besides , the price was very low . It seemed like I 'd found a very good deal , but I was wrong . When I removed the sealing tape from the output hole of the large black cartridge , PGI-225 , ink spurted out with force , hitting my shirt , my shoes , and my floor . It created a large mess that will cost much more than the price of the ink to clean up , if cleaning up is possible.I live near Denver at an altitude of 5200 ' , which is presumably why the ink squirted out . But I have used Epson , HP , and Canon cartridges here and never had a problem before . 2nd-party cartridges , as I mentioned , were often not satisfactory , but they never squirted ink.If you live at lower altitude , maybe this ink will work fine for you , but I can not recommend it .	-1
Setup was a breeze , Had it up and running within 5 minutes from unboxing . The image hole fill function is nice , It even features a blur/smudge correction so that those copies look professional as well . That was the good news , Now here comes the bad news ... It gets hungry , ALOT , so much jamming it throws me back to the injet printers of 2001.. Total nightmare , photo paper jams , copy paper jams and it 's just ridiculous.. Did n't even try any fragile documents after 15 minutes of jamming . This one is just a no go , not worth the headache , especially if what others are saying about `` no technical support ''	-1
This Scott box tape dispenser is not worth your time . While it cuts great , you have to spend extra effort to start each swipe by holding the tape to the box with your fingers . Having used theScotch Box Sealing Tape Dispenser HR80 , 2 in ( which works great ) , I find this particular dispenser quite frustrating . Spend a few extra dollars for the HR80 . It makes your life a lot easier because you never have to manually handle the tape while laying down stripe after stripe .	-1
Okay , I was trying to save some money and went for this non oem product , normally i use TN450 from Brother.First no problem with the shipping as this was fulfilled by Amazon , the only thing was I wish seller would change the price to $ 25 so non prime members can get the free supersaver shipping . Dont think customer will mind the extra penny.Second no compatibility issue , easy to install and my printer HL-2270DW recognize the toner right away.Third this item is suppose to be equal to TN-450 but it is not . This printed great when first installed but the print outs quickly faded . Now I kept all my print counts from the TN-450 and this product as follows : The TN 450 printed 1556 pages prior to low toner light , an additional 543 pages before the change toner light or 2099 pages . However I got an additional 276 pages after overriding the change toner light ( hit the go button 7 times ) for a total of 2375 pages.This on the other hand has only printed 1041 pages before it is now too faded to continue use . Also note this doesnt give you a low toner message as TN450 toner.Overall it actually cost more to use this product as you need to change this toner more frequently than the TN 450 so go with the brother product and not this piece of crap .	-1
Leaves small marks black on the side of the page . Not as good as the original cartridge.would be I guess .	-1
Anyone who sticks removable notes on their desk knows how it can be annoying when they curl up and get snagged easily . These `` Lay Flat '' notes are supposed to fix that with an extra strip of glue close to the bottom end of the paper ( leaving about 3/4 '' on unglued paper so they can still be grabbed ) .The problem is that the glue is not so good . It works OK for a single sticking , but it does tend to start peeling away at the top corners.In the product image above , provided by the manufacturer , these notes are shown wrapped around a tube with an address written on them . They have got to be kidding . I would n't even use them for a temporary notation like that , lest they fall off and the addresses get re-attached to the wrong tube . These sticky notes can barely hold onto a flat desk.I gave them 2 stars instead of one because they are still useful for a temporary single-stick use on my desk ( and I will use them up for that purpose ) . But they are n't any good for much else .	-1
I was intrigued by this product using two adhesive strips , to keep the stack flat until used . In practice , it has some problems : - Because there is no end flipping around , it is actually a bit harder to extract that single sticky sheet . One has to pry up a corner.- Once I had the note out and ready to post , the extra sticky made it difficult to figure out which end of the sheet had the `` real '' sticky . Most of the entire note felt sticky on the back.- It really did n't make any difference , because the sticky notes do not stick ; they begin to come off almost immediately . The company needs to put more or different glue on there.I appreciate the design intent , and I like that the packages support schools via the `` Box Tops for Education '' . But I can not recommend this sticky note package until the product is better . Not recommended .	-1
post-it curls are annoying , so i was excited to use these . unfortunately , these did not live up to my expectation : - each sticky note is more difficult to remove , instead of the classic post-its . i had trouble finding which side to unpeel.- there 's an adhesive strip on the top and about 1/3 up from the bottom , so this also adds to why it 's difficult to remove.- oddly , the notes did n't stay well on paper or regular surface . for something that has all that sticky adhesive , you 'd think it 'd stay put . so they ended up curling up from both ends.- i 've always been able to move post-its around 2-3 times without any issues . not with this one.these sticky notes were either too sticky or not sticky enough . i think i 'll stick with the regular post-its - at least they stay put .	-1
The original Post-Its , and knock offs like this brand , had a mildly adhesive strip just along the top edge . Peeling one off gave the paper a bit of a curl . This sticky notes have an additional sticky strip about 4/5th down the note so you can have another point of adhesion . It almost works , too . However , since the paper still has a bit of a curl , one of the mildly-adhesive sticky ends tends to detach under the tension . It 's usually the top strip that does n't hold -- I think it adheres to well to the pad and curls significantly as I peel it off . Peeling side to side is difficult , and even then the note still curls.I do like these for sticking on the the sides of monitors though , using only the edge for attachment . With the additional adhesive strip the notes stay in place . They still have the curling problem , however .	-1
I absolutely love sticky notes - I used them constantly and they are stuck all over my desk . I 'd not remember anything if it were n't for them . However , anyone who uses sticky notes extensively knows about their two main flaws : 1 ) Adhesive that is n't sticky enough , and 2 ) having the edge curl up constantly . It seems that these sticky notes were specifically designed to solve the second problem . What sets these apart from your average sticky note is that there is a second adhesive strip at the bottom of the note to get rid of the annoying page-curling problem . It seems like a great idea , except that these sticky notes are some of the worst I 've ever dealt with . In fact , they are far worse than many sticky notes I 've had that simply only have one adhesive strip . The problem ? They seem to want to naturally curl upward constantly and do not want to stick to the desk . I do n't know why exactly , but the adhesive seems weak and the sticky note paper seems to only want to curl upward , resulting in a maddening curly sticky note that wo n't stay put . Honestly , I applaud their great idea with the second adhesive strip but I can not ignore the failure of this product nevertheless . It was a good idea that did n't work out in practice . Maybe if the paper had been made differently perhaps this would 've worked . As it is though , I ca n't really recommend this product to anyone .	-1
I like to make my to- do lists on sticky notes so I can transfer them from place to place , and they always end up torn or crumpled . Finally , a sticky note that has sticky across the top AND bottom . However , this good idea is undermined by the mediocre `` sticky '' ... it just does not stick as well as Post-Its . Nice try , Avery , but you have n't won a convert .	-1
Based on the description , I was expecting these sticky notes to have a glue strip at the top and bottom ... or at least a double strip at the top ... or something ? The package I received did not have a second strip at all . They are only sticky at the top , like regular sticky notes . I do n't know if I received the wrong product , or if my expectations were wrong . In any case , these notes are less sticky than some other brands I 've tried . Still usable for some applications , but definitely not outstanding .	-1
I think the idea of a stay-flat note is better than the actual implementation of the idea . It is a little awkward to use , with the two sets of `` sticky '' rows on the back rather than just one . It works , but I think that when I am done using this order , I will go back to normal Post-It Notes instead of these stay flat ones . I ca n't think of a single time where a Post-It not staying flat was a problem , so this is fixing a problem I have never had .	-1
The Avery lay flat stickies do not have enough staying power . The glue on the back lost it 's stickiness within 2 days . Even notes that I do not reposition became loose leaf notes in two days . Avery should revisit their glue formulation for these stickies , customers want their notes to stay flat , but they also need them to stick on longer.They did a great job on their flags but they stick on notes still leave much to be desired .	-1
These notes look like the classic 3M Post-it notes but with an additional row of sticky on the bottom third so the note should theoretically lay flat . I like the concept for situations where you really want the note to stay put . Avery 's product picture even shows an example where you can use these notes on cylinders which could be handy to some people.I 've tested these notes over 2-3 days on a flat surface , and everyone of them that I 've applied normally regardless of color is curling upwards due to the stick not holding firmly . It seems that one problem is that when pulling the note off the pad , the stick is so strong that the paper curls due to the force and angle of removing . With such sticking power , though , I thought that the stick would be able to counter the curling . Immediately after placing the note , it lays flat but after a few minutes or hours the note starting curling up . I 've tried peeling a note off the pad from different angles as well as peeling slower/faster . I 've also tried pressing the note more firmly down . The only thing that sometimes works is if I 'uncurl ' the note in my hand before sticking on the surface which is somewhat annoying and hard to do w/o causing some bend 'markings ' on the note.For comparison , I also tested a standard 3M Post-it next to this product on the same surface . The 3M note never started curling or un-sticking during the test . I 'm not sure if 3M makes a lay-flat note like this product , however , which could have the same problem if it had the second stick row.Avery 's lay-flats are a good idea but implemented poorly . For standard , simple use , these notes do not lay flat and even start to curl up mostly at the top . I 'm sticking with 3M Post-its .	-1
This is a nice concept . The idea of having a sticky note with both top and bottom adhesion sounds like a wonderful idea . In reality though , these really do not work all that well . After a few minutes most of the sticky notes start curling up , usually from the top.It is a good idea , but the product needs to go back to the drawing board . On a positive note , the paper itself is a good quality , as is used in other Avery sticky notes .	-1
Avery has designed a sticky note line with some innovative ideas . The idea behind the Lay Flat Sticky Notes was a good one . Though I have never felt that standard sticky notes needed improvement , I can see where someone might want a note that lays flatter while they write , and does not have the paper curl up on the ends in the process . The solution of adding a second strip was a good idea , it 's just that it did not translate well in the product development phase of the item Avery produced.I use sticky notes every day at my job , and I actually have some notes on my computer screen that have been there for over a year . The ends lay as flat as the day I put them there . So you would think the extra adhesive strip that Avery added would just be a bonus feature to keep their sticky notes flat and in place . Unfortunately , that is not the case . I stuck the Avery sticky notes on two different surfaces -- one on another sheet of paper , and the other on top of my desk . The first thing I noticed was that if you remove the sheet from the pad and place it on another surface before you write on it , you get a little `` bulge in the middle of the paper , between the sticky at the top of the note , and the other sticky placed about 2/3 of the way down that paper . No big deal , but it already blew the `` lay flat '' claim to these notes . The bigger issue , however , is the peeling away at the top AND bottom of the note not long after you place it on another surface . Within a few minutes , the bottom of the note on my desk curled at least 3/4 of an inch off the desk top , and refused to lay flat , no matter how many times I tried to smooth it out . The top of the sticky is also not doing its job , and rises about 1/4 of an inch off the desk top surface . I have never had an issue with the standard 3M brand of sticky notes doing this , and there appears to be a defect in the adhesive that was used as the backing to these notes . The same issue held true for the notes I stuck to other papers , it just was not as prominent in the height it curled off the paper surface . Unless you tape these down with Scotch tape , you will not have a very adhesive sticky note.On a positive note , the paper itself is of good quality , and most pens wrote well on the paper , with the exception of using a red colored pen on the pink and orange note . The color of the red pen just did not show up very well on those two paper colors . Kudos to Avery being involved with the Box Tops for Education initiative . While I try very hard to support companies that offer Box Tops on their products , this is one item that I can not recommend , and will not buy again . I will be staying with my standard sticky notes for now .	-1
I guess the answer is , why not an apple . If you need a dispenser for post-it 's , this will do the job . But it 's unnecesaarily large ( even has pebbles or sand inside to weigh it down ) .This strikes me as one of those products no one has been waiting for or needing . So why waste the plastic on this ?	-1
These Made In China labels are horrible . I do not recommend purchasing them . Basically they are so cheap that they jam your printer , and out of a sheet of two , you are lucky to one scrunched label out of the two.They advertise they are heavy , but they are not . Go buy the real ones from Avery .	-1
I ordered two cartridges the same time.The 1st , which was installed in April was easy to use and change on the Brother printers.The Instructions were clear , unit is clean and offers a green option of returning by mail postage paid for the used oneThe 2nd one I tried to install today ( late May ) is 100 % useless ! I have followed the instructions , and installed it 5 times . The brother printer keeps telling me to replace the toner.I am obviously past a `` warranty '' period and rather than reorder more , I now will have to go to the office supply store for one that I need today.Disappointing , to say the least . From a 5 star to a 1 star rating.Dr . John Hogan CHA CHE CHOHospitalityEducatorsHogan Hospitality	-1
Very disappointing product , very cheaply made . I hate plastic , so I should have known better in the first place After this got destroyed and the sharpener dulled very quickly , I found a German-made metal sharpener that continues to work very well for my colored pencils when the get too short for the electric sharpener .	-1
I 'd assume that this pencil sharpener is designed and manufactured to work with Prismacolor pencils . It may be me - I do n't have much gripping strength - but none of my expensive Prismacolor pencils have sharpened evenly using this device , and since the lead of these pricey pencils is invariably broken inside the casing , this sharpener quickly clogs up with lead and wood shavings and it is a chore to pick out the detritus . I prefer my old electric Swingline sharpener . I would n't recommend this product to anyone who has any gripping problems , it actually is painful trying to use this product . In disappointment , I threw this pencil sharpener in the trash .	-1
This thing is a pain and I do n't bother using it anymore . It has a habit of breaking the point and it comes apart constantly .	-1
The top is very hard to open to dump out the shavings . It will quickly break as the top layer of the cover separates from the piece of plastic it 's lightly glued to , and then you are stuck .	-1
I bought a set of 132 Prismacolor Premier pencils , and this sharpener . Two of those pencils were down to half their length before I had even used them more than once because the first time I tried to sharpen them , this sharpener kept breaking the lead . It broke the lead in almost all of the pencils , but two of them more than the others . I finally followed the advice of other reviewers and bought a Derwent battery operated sharpener , and I have not had a broken lead since .	-1
This model looks a good buy -- but it sharpens art pencils in the smaller opening with points that immediately break as they are not shaped properly . As well , you ( at least I could not ) figure out how to open it . I tried sideways swivel , turn , ect . Maybe I got a dud , but I would n't bother with this !	-1
I updated this on 9/24/12 , decreasing the stars from 4 to 2 . The reason is that , over time , I found these pens to cause a terrible mess . I had to throw a couple away . They sit too long and dump a big blob of ink . Then they do n't recover writing well afterwards . They act like cheap , leaky ball point pens . No joy here.ORIGINAL REVIEW : These are nice , well built pens with a shape that fits your hand nicely and color coding around the push button to indicate its color . Rubber grip is not obtrusive . Very smooth rolling and capable of writing even with little pressure . The only issue I discovered is that you may see some ink blotting up around the tip , which may fall off onto the paper and mess things up . I experienced this with the red medium tip pen . May not be common or a big issue , but something to watch out for .	-1
These pens write pretty well once you get them going , but it takes too long for that to happen - to get them started you have to do that thing where you scratch out some scribbles on the page , and it takes several seconds of doing that before they start writing . Once they get going , the smoothness of the writing is not bad but not great . So overall this is not a product that I would choose to spend money on - there are simply better pens around .	-1
In my experience , this product did not fulfill its promise.Regardless of the claim , the ink would sometimes `` skip '' -- which is just the opposite of what was advertised . I 'll stick with my roller-ball pens for now.Give this product a miss .	-1
[ SECOND EDIT : The blotches have gone away but the ink flow is still inconsistent ... moving the rating to two stars because of this . Wondering if there is a way to work around/through the ink globing/blotching ... ] [ EDIT : After using this pen for a while more.. I can NOT recommend the pen under any circumstances . The ink bleeds through the paper . The ink flow is not consistent ( sometimes it looks like a pen running out of ink ) . The ink blotches badly and randomly . Very annoying ... read the other negative reviews ! ] Fountain pen , ball point , felt tip , roller ball , gel , archival ink , now `` InkJoy . '' Yes , you read that right . This review refers to the 700 RT model.Despite the name , this seems to be a decent pen . The ink flows well . ( Make sure to let it dry before you risk smearing it . ) `` Effortless '' is not an untrue description of how the pen glides but I 'm not sure it 's a major improvement over a Sharpie ( felt tip ) or Uni-ball 207 ( gel , `` super ink '' ) .These pens came in a pack of four with one red , one blue and two black pens ... it 's good for someone who needs this assortment of colors . The color is marked on the top near the `` click '' mechanism . The barrel is a non-descript white with grip ... they wo n't stand out and look rather cheap BUT they do not feel cheap . The `` medium '' point is much thicker than I would expect from a medium point . The result is a very impressive easy to read bold color the will stand out among inks.There is nothing that suggests ( claims ) the ink is `` permanent '' or `` archive '' quality . It does come sealed with a wax tip for freshness like permanent ink pens ... ( the red pen was missing this wax seal ) .So if you are looking to do home work or other non-critical work where you would n't mind bold ink color ... go for it . If you are journaling ( heirloom type for future generations ) or looking to do something that requires permanent ink , you might want to look elsewhere .	-1
As an avid pen collector for over 10 years , I can honestly say that I was very disappointed by the InkJoy 700RT . For how great they look , how attractive the concept ( inspired by grand piano ! ) , and how massively advertised they are ... .they are a below average pen for the price . I do n't know what Paper Mate 's secret advanced ink system is , but it just does n't work . Right out of the package , most of these pens will write lines that feather , the ink will leave little spots , and sometimes it stops working for no reason . Though when they do work , they do write very smoothly ... but the performance is so inconsistent that it just is n't worth the struggle . The only reason I am giving this two stars instead of one is because I like the sleek barrel design and the effort Paper Mate put into advertising . I love seeing pen advertisements . Call me a weirdo.Seriously , I would rather use a BIC crystal ( cheaper , much more reliable ) or even a InkJoy 100RT ( the cheaper pens in the same line ) than the 700 RT . For fancier pens , I would recommend Paper Mate flair , the new Sharpie pen , or the classic Pentel R.S.V.P . You ca n't go wrong with those .	-1
I WANTED to like these pens ... but I didn't.PROS : - Writes with little effort- Bold inkCONS : - CLUMPS of ink like crazy ! No amount of writing or 'warming up ' the pen seemed to make this problem go away . All colors in the set had this problem.- Hand gets all smeared with the clumps of ink , as they do not dry quickly- Difficult to tell difference between colors of pens ( this set has 2 black , 1 red , and 1 blue ) -- there is just a tiny ring at the top to tell the difference . Annoying in a hurry ! So overall , sorry , but I would n't recommend these pens to anyone ... there are hardly an 'inkjoy ' to write with , due to the clumps of ink they leave constantly . Why not take the time to test these products more before bringing them to market ? I think these are just old pens dressed up in new fancy jackets .	-1
These ball point pens have the look and feel of any other low cost ball point . The selling feature of these pens was supposed to be that they start writing easier and smoother.In using them , I could detect that in fact they do write smoother than a normal ballpoint , and they do start writing smoother and easier.The issue with the pens is that the ink has a tendency to Glob up on the tip . When I begin to write , I often find there is a glob of ink on the tip , which makes a large smudge when you begin to write . Also , the ink is more likely to smudge if you touch it after writing.Overall , I would not switch to these pens , and I can not recommend them . Yes , the smooth start is nice , but not at the expense of those nasty ink globs .	-1
I usually really like Paper Mate products but I found these pens to be unreliable . Sometimes I would get a blob of ink on my paper and other times , I 'd have to shake it a bit to get the ink flowing . It 's too bad because I like the feel of them in my hand and the retractable button and nice clean white body are attractive ( for a pen ! )	-1
These pens look excellent , very sleek design with a white handle and gray rubber tip . They are push button and come in red , blue , and black inks in the same package . They write very smoothly and clearly , so far so good , right ? They have a nifty clip so you can put them in your shirt pocket and use them while working . That is when the problem began . They tend to leak from the tip , they stained my shirt pockets and I repeatedly got ink on my hands and on the pen handle itself . I thought this was a fluke and maybe one pen was defective but it happened with all the different colors , strange . I have never had this trouble with BIC pens or any other one I can think of . If it was not for this one problem this would be a 5 star pen , but the ink attack soured me for these pens with all the work to get the ink stains out of my shirts and off my hands .	-1
- ORIGINAL REVIEW -I was pleasantly surprised by this pen . It is a very smooth writing pen that almost feels like a gel pen . The gripper on the shaft is good quality and makes the pen easy to hold . In addition , the clip does not get in my way or dig into my skin between my thumb and index finger , which happens far too often in many pen designs imo.The thickness of this pen is 1.0 ( medium ) but my impression is that it writes thinner than that . This 4-pack has 2 black , 1 blue , and 1 red pen . I would prefer 2 blue instead , but that is a personal preference.Overall , this is a great pen . Whether or not it 's really worth $ 2 per pen is another matter.5 stars- REVIEW UPDATE -Six months after my purchase , I just hate these pens . They get `` gunky '' at the tip if the sit for a bit . They no longer run smoothly . They no longer dry quickly.After getting pen marks on my hands and all over my paperwork ( not once , not twice , but thrice ) , I decided that these must be tossed before I ruin clothing or a purse.2 stars	-1
I bought this pen because it was a papermate & the ad said it was good but it is n't . it leaks & half the time it does n't want to work .	-1
I was expecting something that these are not . They are fine pens and I 'm using them , they just are n't anything special . My error , they are as advertised .	-1
The idea behind these Sticky Notes is to give you a variety of color and size and you just pull out the color/size that you want.For me these Avery Sticky Notes just do n't work . When you pull out the lower sheets if they do n't tear , they either wrinkle or bend or both . And I do n't like the tear line at the top because the line is so pronounced that you can not clearly write over it , you have to write below it . On the Sticky Notes pack that I have , you can not rip the notes out at the tear line without tearing the note itself . To get a complete note , you have to pull the note off at the binder and that leaves the tear strip still at the top of the note.And now that I have had them awhile I am also finding that they do n't stick very well either.Overall a really good idea but very poorly implemented . And I wo n't be buying these over plain sticky notes .	-1
I really wanted to love this printer , I really did . I was having connection problems since the beginning and called Epson tech support for help and they were useless . Once I did get it to print the quality was horrible for a wide format printer .	-1
Aurora AS810SD 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card shredder ( $ 29.99 ) is the same unit.BUT It seems to be overtaxed with a CD or Credit Card . Worst feature is a `` U '' shaped plastic extender that allows you to place the head unit over a larger waste basket . Breaks with the slightest pressure from the top . ALSO this unit increased 25 % in one week ! Was $ 30 now $ 39 ? Get a NAME BRAND . NOTE THE Aurora AS810SD 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card shredder : It is EXACTLY the same unit ( look at the pics ! ) for 25 % less ! ! !	-1
Update : April 4 , 2012I had the unit sitting on top of a 15-inch wastebasket , supported by the extension ( see product images ) . Obviously , the extension was not heavy-duty enough to support the weight of the shredding mechanism , as the whole thing just collapsed . The extension broke off at the body of the shredder . It now BARELY sits on top of the basket that it was designed for . Since I thought that the basket was too small to begin with , this part failure pretty much turned the shredder into a doorstop as far as I am concerned . Downgraded from four stars to two stars . I 've posted a photo of the broken part. -- -- -Original review.Let 's make things straight from the start - this is not an industrial-strength shredder . It is only rated for eight sheets of paper , and it 's not lightning fast . That said , it seems to be perfectly well suited for home use . One of the primary reasons that I was interested in this unit is because I want to be able to shred old credit cards rather that cut them up by hand.To test this unit , I ran an old CD , an expired credit card , and several sheets of paper through the unit . It 's actually more accurate to say that this device breaks ( rather than shreds ) CDs , as a CD is rendered into four pieces . The credit card was , however , shredded . ( See product images . ) The CD goes into a different slot than the credit card and the paper . To get the CD and credit card into the machine , a slight bit of pressure needed to be applied . Only one credit card or one CD at a time can be run through the machine.Pros : The machine accepted up to 14 sheets of paper at a time , but it ran slowly . It was asking a bit much of the poor thing to have it shred 16 sheets . It did it , but only reluctantly , and I would n't recommend doing so . I did n't push it further , as I did n't want to have to clean out a jam . Therefore , I would say that the 8-sheet rating is accurate , and you do n't have to closely count the number of sheets before you shove them in . For the long-term health and continued cheerful cooperation of the unit , it 's probably not a good idea to consistently ask it to do more than its job description requires.It shredded the credit card and broke the CD without any problem whatsoever.The instruction sheet is very clear , and contains information regarding use and basic maintenance.Cons : A couple of `` features '' of this shredder are not so hot ( at least from my perspective ) : ( 1 ) the size of the basket - it 's about 11 x 12 x 6 , smaller than the posted dimensions suggest . ( 2 ) the shape and size of the shredding mechanism.3 ) this is not a cross-cut shredder , and therefore not the best for confidential documents.When I first saw the small size of the basket I assumed that the shredding mechanism could easily be set on top of a larger wastebasket . Well ... . not really . As Maxwell Smart might say , `` Missed it by that much . `` The top piece is adjustable , and can be extended to about 15 inches . However , the ends are curved , and the unit does n't sit that snugly on top of a rectangular wastebasket . Let 's call it a `` meh '' fit . It would probably be difficult to find a larger basket that it would fit nicely . ( Update : I have been using it on top of a 15-inch wastebasket . While it only sits on top of the basket , I have found it to be more stable than I originally anticipated . ) Toss-up : I would prefer to be able to detach the cord from the shredding mechanism , but it is permanently attached . In this case , some people may like this configuration , others might not.The real test of this device will be in terms of its long-term durability . Of course , that is impossible to judge durability at this time . It does come with a one year warranty , and the Amazon product page shows a 1-800 customer service line for the device . I am using it every single day to shred junk mail , and will see how it holds up.If it dies a premature death , I will update this review with all the gory details . Likewise , if this shredder proves itself to be a shredder beyond shredders , a paragon of its species , I will be sure to give credit where credit is due .	-1
Forget what the printer manufacturers tell you about using their own paper ; it 's simply a marketing ploy to get you to but their over-priced paper . This paper is no better than the generic paper I generally use .	-1
My HP printer wo n't print with regular , everyday paper . It has a hissy fit , spews and jams . I purchased this paper hoping against hope my printer would welcome this paper.One out of 5 pieces of paper will print , the rest wrinkles and jams . This is not reasonable , it is expensive and I ca n't blame the paper . The HP Printer I have is out to get me . I have tried the nice soothing game , but to no avail . No print , only jam . Sadly , I must let my printer go and with it this paper . It has not been a positive experience in any way.Not Recommended . prisrob 06-03-14	-1
I was really looking forward to using these folders since they have pockets for a variety of items , including discs . Unfortunately , the folders are very , very flimsy and not at all sturdy . These folders can not withstand any slightly rougher than normal use or they going to tear and be less than usable.I ca n't recommend them .	-1
Only hate it because it does n't work where we need it to work . I thought I had researched enough to know that this would work on the display . But it did n't .	-1

Although I do most of my printing on a cannon printer I needed a new scanner with back up printer and the hp hits my price / use mark . However I need a new scanner / printer because I went postal over my former hp f4280 when the , formerly great SG cartridges would absolutely not work / register and I had a scan that really had to go in and the sucker refused to scan because it would not 'read ' the SG cartridge as in place . ( It refused to understand I did n't care about the ink , I needed a scan ... I deconstructed it after fussing for over an hour . anybody need some parts ? ) I run a cannon printer as my main printer and it works well with SG cartridges as did my former former former HP . The printers are getting really nasty about using their own cartridges and wanting you to change ink cartridges way too early . I hear good things about Epsilon .	-1
First of all this was really difficult to get into the ink cartridge slot . ( HP Deskjet F2210 All in One ) The black HP one clicked right in and I had to fight WWIII to get the colored one in place ... .Also HP does not recognize this cartridge as the printer does some other non OEM cartridges so ink levels never shows up.Now after printing just a few colored documents , the printer tells me I am out of color ... .I continued to try to print color and of course it did not work ... .I got nice black and white prints ... .but no color ... ..So I am questioning just exactly how much ink is in this cartridge ... ..I suspect not much so I got what a paid for ... .not much ... .I do n't recommend . Spend a bit more and get either HP or another brand ... .Update June 4 , 2011- I noticed in this 2nd pkg of the colored cartridge is a little note tucked under the clip you pull off and discard : `` Please be aware that due to new programming features in printers the ink level for this cartridge might appear empty '' This note was not on the other color cartridge . They are right : it always shows no ink ! ! ! I ordered 2 packages of 2 ... ..I 'm bummed ! ! !	-1
I bought these because I wanted to line all 3 monitors up horizontally . All 3 of my monitors are identical . They are 23 '' Asus LED monitors . Assembly of this stand was pretty straight forward . I had to cut a hole in my desk because I have a corner desk and mounting it at the corner was over 2 feet away and the monitors were too far back.I didnt mind cutting the holes but the thing that really got me upset , is after all of the assembly , the monitors do NOT line up . I used a level when I mounted each monitor , they are all level . The outside monitors are 2 different heights than the central monitor . Left one is 1/4 inch too low the right one is over 1 inch too low . I was going to use this set up for flight sims but instead I am returning it right now . You cant have 3 different heights with flight sims.I am not sure what version the other reviewers received but mine is unadjustable for height with individual monitors . You can rotate it on the Y axis but can not move it vertically . I spent over 2 hours trying because most of the reviews here said you could adjust the monitors individually . I must have received a different version.Also I BARELY got my 23 '' monitors to mount all together . I SERIOUSLY doubt you could get 27 '' ones mounted.Pros : + Holds 3 monitorsCons : - Everything else.Thanks for reading my review .	-1
I purchased this for my 24 & # 34 ; Asus monitors . There is no flexibility to angle with 24 & # 34 ; . The monitors sit a good 8 & # 34 ; into my desk space , so close to my face it 's unbearable and hard on the eyes . Unfortunately I waited 34 days before having time to install and ca n't return . If you buy them , try them quickly but I have to give this mount a thumbs down .	-1
Thin , cheap plastic . Large and cumbersome . Ca n't wait to get rid of it ! Very disappointed . Would not recommend for purchase	-1
I bought these to use as flash cards for school . Though not mentioned in the product 's descriptionThey are a different color from front to back , which did n't serve my purpose , as I was using color-coding for several things . They feel cheap , and the ruled lines are not very well inked , light and wispy . I wo n't buy these again .	-1
This item is total garbage . It failed to open the first thing I tried it on . I had to attempt to follow the first cut line over several times to get it to even cut through in a few spots . Unfortunately , this left a lot of razor sharp plastic edges/shards . In the end , I gave up and threw it in the garbage and got out my old trusty kitchen shears . See my customer image of the blade which also appears to have chipped on the very first usage . This garbage was useless in less than 15 seconds of use and is very poorly made .	-1
I really wanted to like this product , as I have cut myself , sometimes fairly seriously , on a number of occasions using a utility knife to open both boxes and blister packs . This product seemed to be the ideal solution to the problem , however , I was sorely disappointed with the end results.The concept is fairly simple and seems to be a good idea . Make a lightweight plastic handle with a blade that is sharp enough to open blister packs , while not so sharp as to cut yourself seriously if it slips . In addition , the blade is recessed so that only a small portion extends beyond the plastic so any cut is likely to be shallow.In reality , I discovered that it worked well on the first blister pack , was slightly less effective on the second , and by the third the blade was so dull that I needed all my strength to pull it through the plastic . It did continue to work well for opening the tape on boxes , but it needed a new blade after three blister packs to continue to use it for that purpose . That would get expensive in a big hurry ! I will continue to stick to the tried and true methods I have developed for opening plastic blister packs , and will not bother to use this product in the future .	-1
I get a steady stream of small packages into my house and was hoping for a convenient knife that would open them . When I opened this package , the advancement button for the retractable blade was barely attached . The blade is quite tiny , the size of a `` v '' in 12 font type . It might open small packages , but not larger ones and sooner or later tha advancement button will fall off.I suggest getting a conventional box cutter instead .	-1
The blade is so small you have to get it exactly positioned correctly to even have a chance for it to work . If you are off perpendicular , the cutting is erratic.I 've tried it on a bunch on things : Packages from Amazon , DVDs and of course sealed in hard plastic items.It eventually worked on all of them . But in all cases , a plain scissors would have been easier . I even had trouble opening the DVD . But once a cut is made on the DVD plastic you can easily rip that open.I searched around for the refill blade and found it on one site for $ 3.All in all , I think this was a poorly designed , poorly executed product.Stick with a good pair of scissors for now .	-1
Being someone who receives on average a dozen or so packages a week , I thought that this Scotch Safe Cut Package Opener would be a godsend . Well after a few weeks of using it , I 'm not entirely sold on it 's effectiveness.As a tape cutter on shipping packages , the tiny blade gets clogged up with packing tape way too easily . So I had to stop , remove the tape from the blade , and continue . Long story short , I went back to using my pocket knife for cutting the packing tape.For opening clam-shell and other plastic packages , not bad . The biggest issue I had was getting the blade to puncture the plastic . Once it did it worked great ! One nice thing are the ergonomics of the opener , comfortable and sturdy nonslip grip.At the end of the day , I would suggest purchasing a small pocket knife instead . This has very limited uses and the blade on mine is already dull to the point it is not unsafe to use .	-1
I was truly surprised at how bad this was . The tiny blade is ineffective against most anything . I could not open a plastic wrap with it . I found it useless against tape on a box . Not even sure I would be able to use it as a letter opener . Save your money and use a box cutter or a knife or scissors for those pesky plastic wrapped packages and whatnot .	-1
I spend a LOT of money at Amazon , so I 'm getting boxes all the time . I 've been using a normal flip open knife I just carry in my pocket to open boxes , but thought this would be an interesting possibility . It came in easy to open packaging , even the tie holding it to the cardboard was n't plastic , just a twist tie . I thought that was a nice touch , until I tried to cut even the very thin cardboard this was packaged in . And it could n't . I could scratch it , but I could n't cut it except for one tiny little spot where it actually penetrated all the way through in three or four attempts of cutting a 2 inch long slash in the packaging.I got a few other Amazon items today as well , so thought I 'd use this then just for the tape . Standard packing tape with the string in it that 's often used by companies who ship things . Even there it failed . Barely cut the tape , and only one of the strings was actually severed.So next I pulled out the inflated packaging bladders that Amazon uses to fill space inside to keep boxes from sliding . I generally squeeze one end to get them nice and pressurized , then use my knife to slice the other end open to let the air out . This could n't even manage THAT . I got , in six different bladders , just one actually penetrated with this , and that was just barely ... All in all , a complete fail for me . The ergonomics of the handle itself are alright , but the button on top to slide the cutter out is just poor and cheap , and I can see how easily that could break on someone . Add that to the lack of performance on all the things I tried that I would expect it to do make this a poorly executed product in my eyes .	-1
As a consumer who struggles with the blister packs that hold many of today 's products , I had high hopes for Scotch 's Safe Cut Package Opener . Thankfully , it is easily removed from its own packaging , but that is where the convenience ends . I 'd collected some blister packs to test it out on as well as some other items , and was disappointed with how it worked with all of them.First off , the ergonomic handle is small and it feels tiny in my medium-large hands . Secondly , it feels flimsy -- as if it will break after a brief period of use . The blade click mechanism is n't overly precise and you have to be careful when extending the blade to get it in the correct position . It is very easy to push it all of the way out , to the position where the blade is removable . When in the correct position , only the tinniest sliver of a blade is exposed . I understand the reasoning for this , but it makes it rather difficult to apply it correctly to all but a flat surface.To begin with , I tried using it on a couple of blister packed products I had yet to open . After repeated attempts , I was able to score deeply enough to pry the packaging apart , but it was no easier than using a pair of scissor and not as easy as an X-acto blade or utility knife . Using the Safe Cut on shrink-wrapped water bottles and on a sealed CD case was n't much better . It was a disaster when trying to open envelopes or packages , just shredding the paper . The tiny blade is too hard to position correctly and is n't sharp or large enough to do the job right . It did open a bag of potato chip easily , but you need a flat cutting surface to lay the bag upon , and several chips were crushed in the process.After extensive testing , I can not recommend Scotch 's Safe Cut Package Opener . While the concept is a good one , the product itself needs to be better constructed and to go through further engineering . Sadly , I think it is just going to get thrown in my kitchen utility drawer and forgotten.~ KortUPDATE : I received a small box from Amazon today so decided to try opening it using the Opener . Once again , it took a number of passes to break the tape 's seal . A similar box when opened with a utility knife or single scissor blade usually only takes one swipe per seam .	-1
I 'm sorry to say I was disappointed in this product . It is very flimsy ; the button that you slide to extend the blade out in order to use it feels like it could snap off at any time . It was frustrating to use , because in order to get it to cut through even tape on a package , I had to run it back and forth several times . Even then , I would get a few holes in the tape at best , and have to rip it open the rest of the way . I tried it on packaging tape when opening boxes , as well as the paper tape that comes on packages , and it struggled consistently with each . I do like the safety feature of being able to retract the blade , but that was the only redeeming factor in a product that is n't able to achieve its purpose .	-1
This is basically a very small razor blade attached to a large plastic handle . The blade is not replaceable , and so when it dulls , you have to throw the entire thing away . Setting that aside , the blade is n't sharp enough or deep enough to make a serious impact on the plastic packages that its marketed as being able to open . If I had n't gotten this free , I would have returned it .	-1
I grew up using box cutters working in our family owned business . Thousands of sealed boxes met their doom daily by my hands and my trusty utility knife . I can honestly say they have n't changed much over the last 30 years . The Scotch Safe Cut Package Opener puts a little spin on the good old box cutter . Unfortunately , this change is hardly much of an improvement . Here are my thoughts ; Pros+ Good for precision cutting such as opening DVDs , CDs , video games , letters and in my case sealed vinyl.Cons- Small handle . I do n't have particularly large hands for a man but this was too small for me to feel like I had a firm grip on it . The handle is also white and dirties quickly . Most packages you receive in the mail are terribly dirty so white probably is n't the best color choice.- Miniscule razor blade , hence why I felt it was only good for precision cutting.- Blade dulls quickly if used repeatedly on tougher clam-shell style plastics . Also , you 're supposed to be able to replace it , however it seems more cost effective ( although not very environmentally friendly ) to throw it away and buy a new one.In the end , I found this tool rather disappointing . It sits on my kitchen island eagerly awaiting junk mail to open or the occasional sealed vinyl LP that I purchase . Other than those two uses I do n't see this tool getting much more use around the house .	-1
I really do n't see the need for this tool at all . Yu push a button to have a tiny blade sticking out to cut through packaging . But the button is loose . The tool itself is too small and difficult to hold , and I have small hands I tried it on several packages . The blade is not sharp . I really do n't see the point of having this extra tool in my drawer . I may as well use my box cutter .	-1
This tool is simply the pointy corner edge of a razor blade . I do n't see how anyone can think it is more effective than scissors . Possibly more safe , because only about 3mm of the blade sticks out and hardly does any damage . It is basically a worse version of a box cutter . The mechanism to slide the blade in and out does n't even lock . So much for safe . It also does not cut through tape with any relative ease at all . The only thing this might be good for is gift wrap .	-1
This is a neat little device for opening those hard clear plastic sealed packages . It sometimes works well but does n't completely solve the problem of opening those packages . It used to easily cut the packages on the straight sides but does n't work as well on the corners . And some packages have a sealed opening at the top where the package can hang on a rack , it also does n't do much to cut that area open.The Scotch Safe Cut has a little cutting blade that you extend out by pushing down on a button at the top of the Safe Cut . Then when you are done you can retract it so the blade is covered and no chance of cutting yourself . It is supposed to have a refillable blade but I can not find them anywhere . Overall , the price is reasonable and I highly recommend the Scotch Safe Cut as the best method yet to open those pesky plastic packages and believe me , I have tried everything.However , I finally gave up on this Scotch package opener as it would n't cut most of the plastic sealed packages that I got recently and the cutter kept falling out of the holder . I ended up just throwing it away as it was more trouble to use than it was worth . A good idea failed for poor design and implementation .	-1
I have n't much to share here ... I used this to open 2 blister packs ( ironically items from Amazon : ) ) - it worked on one . The blade flew off on the second item and it was destroyed.Probably not sturdy enough for blister packs ... 1/5 for the effort..would be rated lower if I could .	-1
This product is nothing more than a very small knife/dull razor blade . The blade is small , so it is safer than using a box cutter , but it is also nearly impossible to follow the contours of some packaging . I prefer sticking to the tried and true razor blade or scissors . I have never cut myself when opening plastic packages with a razor blade , so that 's how I will continue to do it.The design of the package opener is not good and I ca n't figure out why they decided to make the blade aim down from the handle instead of out the front like everyone is accustomed to from using knives and razor blades over the years.In short , I do not recommend this unit and highly recommend sticking with the razor blade or scissors . Sure , this thing will open a package , but you will have been aggravated by the time it happens .	-1
The handle is very comfortable and the blade is very sharp . There is a nice safety feature that requires you to depress a button to get the blade to drop down . It works very well for many uses-opening boxes , cutting string , etc ( it 's similar to but much safer than using one blade from a pair of scissors or a razor blade ) .The problem is the blade does not come far enough down to work on a lot of plastics ( specifically clamshell cases which is what I was really hoping to use it on ) .	-1
The nice thing about this package opener is that it 's cheap . Really cheap . The downside of this is that it 's cheap . Really cheap . It feels incredibly light and flimsy , the blade is n't all that sharp and is absolutely tiny . It 's not weighted at all , and this device actually made opening packages an irritating procedure . I 'd highly recommend something different , for your own sanity.2 stars out of 5 .	-1
I READ THE GREAT REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT AND WANTED TO USE IT FOR MY PURSE . I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I RECEIVED IT . ALTHOUGH IT HAS MANY COMPARTMENTS TO STORE ALL OF YOUR PENS , IT WAS WAY TOO BIG TO PUR IN MY PURSE AND SEEMED MORE LIKE A HASTLE THAN HELP -- VERY CUMBERSOME TAKING THE PENS OUT . DONT BUY !	-1
I was leery of purchasing an HP printer because I 've had problems with any other printers besides lexmark that I 'd purchased in the past . When my lexmark died , The wireless versions were out of stock & since I had an HP laptop I figured I 'd try an HP printer . I 'm regretting that decision now.1 . The ink cartridges have to be replaced 2-3 times a MONTH . compared to the lexmark of 1x mo2 . the quality of the printing is n't as good as lexmark.3 . It does n't take banners or longer size paper.- my lexmarks did.4 . 3 months after I installed it , it stopped communicating with the computer . In order to print anything , I 'd have to walk down 2 flights of stairs , turn the printer on and off MANUALLY , then walk back 2 flights of stairs down the hall to my router and turn that on and off ! ! ! ! - I had to do this EVERY SINGLE TIME I wanted to print anything ! Not being a computer wiz I did not know & should n't have to know how to remedy that problem ! 5 . 4th month it started getting paper jams left and right.I finally threw it away because the whole freakin reason I wanted a wireless is so i did n't have to walk down & up 2 flights of stairs to print something . I 'm disabled & just walking hurts at night.My lexmark lasted 4 years , I printed on heavy cardstock , even fabric- if it fit in the guide lines the lexmark would print on it . I 'll not purchase another HP .	-1
This wo n't work wirelessly with our all Mac household . Returned it.It does look nice and sleek , though . Too bad .	-1
I thought this dispenser was going to be round , or at least `` teardrop '' shape . . . . It 's not . . . It 's an `` odd '' / `` warped '' shape which is extremely unattractive . I do n't know why it was designed to be `` covered '' with a `` hole '' in the front . The `` hole '' does not make it very easy to get the tape out . I think a MUCH better option is the `` basic '' tape dispenser link below . It 's inexpensive . . . does the job very well . . . and if you 're a `` Prime '' member you receive free two-day shipping.Scotch Desk Tape Dispenser , 1in . Core , Black	-1
Once the tape is in place , it is fine . However , I have little girls that like to play with my tape and the dang dispenser is impossible to grab and replace on the metal without having to open it because you ca n't really get to the roll from the opening . It 's cute , and if I did n't have children messing with it , it would probably be fine . However , the closed top design just makes it harder to replace and aggravates me .	-1
Finally , Canon has caught up with Epson in providing CD printing . Too bad the execution is just as bad as Epson's.It is a mystery to me why one of these companies does not provide a dedicated CD printer at the $ 100 price point . I do n't want scanning or print printing . Just CD.And so I am stuck with a Frankenstein printer that requires you to jump through hoops to print a CD . Further , the printer will not work with CD printing software that is not Canon . And the software packaged with the printer is pathetic and very limiting.Also , the wireless does not work . I ended up using a cable . I should have saved $ 20 and purchased the non-wireless version.Ink consumption is on par with the Epson . Every several CDs , you must shut the door and let it consume ink and then resume printing . Figure 50 cents per CD using Canon ink with minimal photos on the face.I tried it for regular printing and it was OK . Certainly nothing I 'd want to waste the money on printing with expensive inkjet cartridges when I could do it through a photolab on real silver-based paper for less money.All in all , somewhat better than Epson because the heads have not clogged ( yet ) . Epsons are the worst printers in the world because of their head clogging . Canon is better , but the execution is very clunky . And the lack of compatibility with other software is a real drawback .	-1
I 've been using printers to print out photos at least 12 years- this is the first printer I 've ever had that has HORRIBLE color . None of the photos colors come out even close . PLUS it takes any part that is a shadow & just washes it all out & blends it into the nearby colors- it makes everything way too dark- I spent twice as much on this printer as I had intended , because I thought since it is called a PHOTO printer that meant it would be better at printing photos than just plain old economy printers- well . it 's not- the quality is far below bare bones models of printers & I have tried tweaking the colors , contrast etc . NOTHING makes the photos look like the original ! All other printers I had printed supurb quality photos without any tweaking at all & cost HALF of what this one cost . It is also slow as mollasses ! It TAKES almost 2 minutes to make a plain black copy- just to get to the point where it even starts to print.- & I 'm not even using the wireless feature- I have it directly plugged in ! Pros- I LOVE how easy to use the interface isIt 's sleek & pretty.The paper loading drawer works good.The tray unfolds itself automatically AND none of the pages fall on the floor.FIX the color problem & how long it takes to start to print & it would be a top of the line printer.I 'm going back to lexmark- I NEVER had a problem with any lexmark I ever owned.I have had probs with Epson- never could even get it to work at allHP , only worked for 3 months before it started getting paper jams & not communicating with the computer . & it was hooked up to an HP computer ! - ya ca n't get any more compatable than that ! Kodak was a piece of crud- kept malfunctioning .	-1
3 consistent complaints among users , including me : ( 1 ) Color prints are too red , ( 2 ) Ink HOG , ( 3 ) Mine stopped working after 3 months with a `` Print head is incorrect - install the correct print head '' message . Well , the print head is the original Canon factory-installed one . I would rate this below zero if I could .	-1
UPDATE : I 've only printed maybe 200 pages with this printer , but it 's a CONSTANT problem which means it takes me MUCH longer to get work done . I 'm on an extra hour trying to print a presentation of 40 pages.It just decides to stop printing and tells me to turn it off and back on . That usually gets it going , but it takes FOREVER to print a page after you turn the power back on.It uses A LOT of ink , even though I 've only printed about 200 pages through it.I 'd never buy another Canon product . This is just trash. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -After a power failure , the stupid printer tells me I did n't turn it off correctly.It takes forever to print a page after turning it on after a power failure , and even if the thing was already powered up.It seems to use a lot of ink , and I do n't even use the thing . Maybe I 've printed 20 pages with it total.I primarily use my old Brother because it 's faster . I wanted to replace that piece of garbage because it uses a lot of ink - and wo n't print if any cartridge is empty . Same thing with this Canon - maybe worse.The ONLY thing I use this printer for is Airprint from apple devices . That works OK - except it takes A LONG TIME to start printing.I did n't buy an Epson ( the original Airprint printers ) because of the hassles I 've had with Epson printers over the years ( we used to buy a lot of them ) The paper tray in the front is really unfriendly , and the paper tray in the back is extremely unfriendly to use.You 'd think the idiots who design these things would try using them for a while to see how pissed off they get , before selling the junk.I really do n't know what brand/model is a better printer , but I 'd suggest NOT buying Canon , Epson or Brother - unless you own stock in the company.We do have one older Canon MX870 All in 1 printer that does n't seem to stop printing black when it runs out of color , but the reviews on that printer says it does the same thing as this piece of junk ( we hardly ever print color ) . We mainly use it for incoming and outgoing faxes , and it seems to work OK for that . As a matter of fact the document feeder seems to take as many pages as we give it without skipping any ( so far , we 've been using it for about a year ) . We have it on our wired network in-case someone needs to print to it ( or we can fax from any PC ) , and that works when we occasionally need to .	-1
I bought this to print on DVD disc . It only lasted for about 300 disc and then the heads went out . If consider that a DVD disc is about the same as a 4X6 picture , you could only print a few hundred pictures before the head will be ruined . Just another piece of junk designed to be replaced to keep you buying more and more to stimulate the economy . Does n't it feel great to know that you live in a country where you are an economic slave who 's only function is to spend money to stimulate the economy ; and if you wo n't do it voluntarily , they will just make things that do n't last or force you to upgrade .	-1
UPDATE 4-1-12 THIS SUCKER GOBBLES INK . IT 'S THE WORST INK EATER I HAVE EVER USED and will drive up the cost of my graphics like crazy . I no sooner got started when it said the ink is nearly out ! i WOULD NOT BUY THIS UNIT AGAIN . It would have been worth it to pay this same price for a new print head for my old i960 . Gon na try Sophia ink and hope . It 's only a simple printer yet the set up is as involved as if I were re-programing the mars rover . It takes a long time to receive the order to print although it is a direct wire from tower printer usb to printer . Once it makes the connection it is ok . I like the lower paper cartridge as it keeps paper clean and the top cover can stay down to keep the stink bugs from dropping in . I use this for graphics for a home based business but this and every printer today is fixated on printing photos of my dogs and kids to send to Nana . I 'm having trouble getting it to do a well aligned sheet of labels and am using my hp printer for that task . I like the canon , separate cartridge for each color but I have no info yet on cartridge life . I like that documents are printed from a separate cartridge . I like the footprint size and low rectangular presence in my work area and it 's flat top . My graphics are reproducing crisply and with fine color but a tad slower than my former , canon i960 . I plan on keeping clear of the Canon Creative Park Premium as it MAY interfere with ink refilling or use of non canon ink tanks . These manufactures need to remember that all of the peripherals are just tools and not a way of life . Who really needs a Canon Facebook friending ?	-1
This took about fifteen minutes to assemble . The instructions are straight forward and everything is well labeled . It took me an extra minute or two to figure out how to unlock the tilt mechanism , but that was only because it was on the other side of the page from the assembly instructions . Duh.Assembly , though , is something that 's only done once ... after that you have to sit in the thing and that 's where I have some concerns . The lumbar support is decent , but I 'm used to chairs that have much more cushion in the seat . I 'm hoping that it softens over the next couple of weeks , otherwise , I 'm going to be chair shopping ( again ! ) . At the moment , I 've been sitting in it for a couple of hours and my rear is getting pretty sore.HON generally makes good products , but I 'd advise you to try any chair out in a store before ordering on-line . It 's important that your chair fits your individual build and personal preferences .	-1
I returned this piece of junk because during set-up it ate the paper . Then proceeded to have problem after problem with the seller . My advice ? DO NOT buy one of these printers . It should have DEFECTIVE printed where it says Canon . I could n't tell you if the wireless works because I never got that far . It was too busy eating paper . Nice ink though . Very colorful when smeared .	-1
I got this on special and was so excited that I bought one for my neighbor also and his print heads went out also so read the reviews before buying a printer but I would take this one off your list !	-1
I guess I was n't clear on exactly what this product was when I ordered it , but it seems ... a little silly.This is basically a regular Avery label ( if the `` removable '' thing is *any* different , I ca n't tell ! ) , on a full sheet , but with a little strip around the edges so you can expose adhesive around the edges if you want to put it in a window facing out . There might be very specific uses for this , but since I really wanted a removable sticker , this is not useful to me.Other than that , you know , it 's an Avery label , so the quality is good .	-1
I had it for about a year and this Epson printer worked fine . The installation was pretty easy , but it did not take in thicker cardstock paper like my previous HP printer did . I tried tinkering with settings , but Epson would still not take cardstock.The scanner worked as expected . I liked the printer 's small size and compact footprint.HOWEVER , after a little more than a year ( and warranty expiration ) , NX430 died . But it did not die peacefully ! It made me order two sets of ink cartridges because it kept not recognizing magenta . At first , I faulted off-brand ink cartridges I used . I never had a problem with off-brand ink before , but ordered a brand new set . However , after the new set of ink , it still did not recognize magenta . Then I bought Epson brand ink and the printer still DID NOT recognize magenta.I tried cleaning the printer head . I wasted half a box of q-tips . I wasted money on ink that now I could not use . Then I decided that I am not going to spend $ 100+ each year on a new printer and if it is going to die after a year , I might as well buy something cheap . So I got HP Deskjet 1000 Printer for $ 36 . It does not have a scanner , but that is not a big loss for me .	-1
I did a lot of research before buying the Epson Artisan 837 to replace my aging HP 7410 . Both professionals and individuals posted glowing reviews and picked this Epson as the best all-in-one inkjet available . I must have a lemon as the color printing is just pathetic . In comparison my HP was vastly superior , but due to extensive use was no longer reliable . I hope that other buyers of this machine will post other due criticism because I bought this printer on the glowing recommendations of recent purchasers . The small inkjet cartridges are cheap , but these do not last very long . I suspect that `` the bottom line '' ink cost is about the same when compared to other printers with larger ( but more expensive ) cartridges . I would not recommend you buy the Epson Artisan 837 unless you get an in-store demonstration of color printing directly from the machine you will be hauling out the door . The wireless printing is reliable and very handy for multiple laptop and notebook users in our household , the only redeeming feature.UPDATE May 2012 - although I bought Epson photo paper the pickup drive will not load this paper into the printer - after much jockeying about I found that placing a plain piece of paper between each photo sheet helped some but it was not a convenient fix - the paper drawer is of poor design which will allow you to help push the top sheet into the printer with your finger when it is loading thicker sheets like HP generally does - the ink usage has been better than expected but it is wise to keep a spare set of cartridges on hand at all times as once a cartridge is dry the printer seizes up - I would not rate this printer more than 2 stars for the home office user - but I do n't know of a better choice due to the flagging quality of all major brands	-1
Printer was received November 3 . Installation was done on November 11 but failed because printer would not recognize ink cartridges . Calls to Epson on November 11 and November 15 received promises to overnight new cartridges . None were ever received.I bought new cartridges at Amazon and Staples ; and these were tried on November 29 . Printer would not recognize them.Amazon return request was submitted November 29 . First email from seller , `` LowPriceFastShipping , '' claimed I was beyond thirty-day return period and that they would consider making an exception . I furnished UPS tracking info showing November 3 delivery . Now seller seems now cooperative but did not immediately agree to accept a return.I will avoid this seller and this printer in the future.Dec 2 - Amazon gave me a full refund after my third call to them today . Seller never agreed to a refund and kept asking for more time to review the matter . Dead-on-arrival printer sits in my office repacked in its original box and will go in the dumpster since Amazon said they do not want it back . I grade this Amazon - B , LowPriceFastShipping - F , Epson - F .	-1
I must 've got a bad one of the epson artisan color inkjet wireless all-in-one with fax . After 2days & about 6hrs I still ca n't get it to recognize its ink cartrides or my wireless .

Field test of this Epson Artisan 837 shows the claimed scanner resolution of 4800 dpi is far in excess of actual results . Only 300 lines per inch scanner resolution can be achieved . ( Caveat : this result is so bad that I can only imagine that I scanned the test pattern in ` Standard ' rather than ` Best ' quality , despite my selection of ` Best ' ) .Dealbreaker note : when scanning to USB media , this unit overwrote three prior Epson test results with files of the same name . That is , it did not check for and correct for file name collision . That is unacceptable.Other shortcomings noted below. -- Roy ZiderRated : 4800 dpi optical resolution for scannerMeasured : 300 lpi actual pixel granularityScanned : 7/21/2012 12:03 at Best Buy , Oakland , CAScan target : A & P ; PM-189 ( 15 lines in funnel patterns ) PRIOR TEST RESULTS WERE LOST - overwritten in USB by this test of Artisan 837 .

The Epson software provided with this printer installs spyware on your computer in the form of the Ask.com toolbar without your knowledge.A few days ago I found that the Ask toolbar had been installed on one of my systems at a time when no one was at work or using the computers . It took only a few minutes to find that the offending software was installed by the Epson printer software . In fact it had been installed on all six computers in my office that had the Epson 837 printer installed.A look at the Add/Remove programs screen also revealed the following software : Epson Customer Participation , Epson Download Navigator , and Epson Event Manager . All these programs communicate over the internet and all were apparently installed with the Epson software packageI am very frustrated with the endless task of trying to keep all the unwanted junk ware , ad ware , and spyware off my machines.I accuse Epson of sleazy business practices . How about it Epson ? Have you no shame ? Have you no ethics ? UPDATE 11/18/2013 After a recent install carefully choosing not to allow any internet access to the Epson Software , I got a popup from Windows Security Alert saying Windows Firewall had blocked net access to EEventManager by SEIKO EPSON CORPORATION . I chose to Keep Blocking the software . Also got a popup from Epson requesting that I install the LTCM Desktop Client . This is so called `` non harmful '' spyware by Leader Technologies . And yet another popup from Epson requesting that I become a part of `` a new research study to understand printer and ink use . If you choose to help , your printer usage data will be sent anonymously to Epson . `` I now think I understand at least a part of why they are wanting to update firmware and track my ink use . I found one person on the internet complaining that after Epson had updated their firmware the third party ink they were using no longer worked.I would very much like to know what others are observing about Epson 's behavior.===================================2/11/2014 UpdateI would not recommend this printer if you plan to use non Epson Ink . Tried several brands with the two 837s that I own and none have performed for any length of time . The Epson ink is very expensive .	-1
UPDATE OCTOBER 2013DOWNGRADED TO TWO STARSAfter about a year or so of working flawlessly my printer has started spewing yellow ink everywhere.A quick online search tells me that this is a BIG problem with a lot of owners , one enterprising guy has even posted a video online after completely stripping the unit down to exactly what is causing the problem , although Epson apparently are indifferent to this product flaw , and have not issued a recall.For me after just spending over $ 100 to replace the ink I am now left with a very expensive brick , that I ca n't use and need a new printer.Very unhappy with Epson . Probably think twice before you purchaseThis work pro printer would certainly be at home in a small office environment , and I suspect that for home use will be limited to those people with plenty of space , or who have excessive printing needs.With a second paper drawer base that the unit sits on top of , it holds up to 580 sheets of paper ( less if using various sizes ) and includes the two drawers to separate legal , letter or A4 for example.Set up is easy with the included DVD and instructions , once connected the printer takes about 12 minutes to run through it 's initial set up programming.Connection is wireless , wired via USB , or wired via Printer cable - a word of warning - there is NO printer cable supplied ? ? ? I mean give me a break really ! Exactly how much do you need to spend on a printer to get a cable included ? Most will use it for wireless , so I suppose it 's a moot point , I just find it annoying.Wireless setup was very easy , all done through the large touch screen front panel , and it 's fairly idiot proof.I 'm not personally using the FAX function so ca n't comment on that , but I do like that when you access printer preferences from your PC , you get a separate menu for fax preferences from the main menu for the standard options like print quality etc.It 's BIG , no other word for it , it stands over 17 '' high on my file cabinet next to my desktop PC and almost 18 '' wide , and 16 '' deep - worth remembering if you have limited space.It 's VERY FAST , the fastest I 've used for an inkjet , but considering the cost that 's probably not surprising.Two sided printing is also nice for any projects , and is simply a click of the mouse to change.Copying is Photocopy style with a auto feed slot on top , scanning documents requires the lid to be lifted.I have not had chance yet to go into ALL of the features the printer offers , but the Amazon and Epson description above is pretty detailed.It takes 4 INK cartridges ( included ) and at time of writing this review , replacements are not available yet to buy online , even from Epson directly , I suspect because this is a very new model . Obviously I ca n't comment on INK value and life , as I have not exhausted any cartridges yet , although the description and box boasts a 50 % efficiency saving , we will see.Another plus with the bundled installation disc is ABBYY Fine reader 9.0 , this let 's you scan any image , and convert it into a Word or PDF for editing , very nice and handy feature if you have to fill in a lot of forms , and do n't have PDF input software . It also has an integration set up feature with Microsoft Office , for effortless document printing.So far I 'm very impressed , probably too much for a home setup , but certainly capable of handling a lot , and I suspect it will be a very popular small business option , with near laser printing speeds.Did I mention it was BIG by the way ? 4 stars overall , I took off a star for no printer cable , and no photo editing software package , and large footprint .	-1
ADDENDUM **** ADDENDUM **** ADDENDUM****15 December 2011 . Last night I spent over an hour on the telephone with Epson tech support . I was trying to print some photo Christmas cards , and I could n't find any way to eliminate an annoying 1/8 '' border around the perimeter of the prints.Well , guess what ? It turns out that this printer -- the top of Epson 's line of all-in-ones -- is incapable of printing in true `` borderless '' mode . Not pictures , not documents , nothing . According to tech support , the drivers and software do n't support borderless printing . Period.YOU CA N'T PRINT BORDERLESS PHOTOS OR DOCUMENTS ON THIS MACHINE ! I do n't know about you , but I 've had a variety of printers over the years , from Epson , HP and Canon , and this is the first one I 've had that WO N'T PRINT BORDERLESS.I 'm deducting another star for that flaw , all by itself . TWO STARS ONLY for this printer.Now , you can read my original review below the line._______________________________________________________________________________That 's okay . I 'm a realist , and I know anything made by humans entails a certain amount of human error . And a certain number of products are going to be manufactured with defects , and that 's particularly true with new products , which may still have to have the kinks ironed out . That 's the nature of the beast . I wo n't judge the totality of the product simply because I got a clunker , unless the company wo n't step up and fix the problem.I decided this gave me the chance to also assess Epson 's customer support as part of my review.Here 's the problem I encountered . After diligently following the instructions , when I turned on the printer for the ink cartridges to initialize , I kept getting an error message telling me the process was aborted because I 'd left packing materials inside the printhead bay . The problem was that I had n't . No way , no how . Nothing in there.So I got Epson customer service on the line ; the tech walked me through some simple diagnostic checks , the problem was n't solved , and he promptly authorized an exchange at no cost to me.The next day I took the printer , in its original packaging , to my nearest Fedex/Kinkos and sent it back . That was on 28 Sep.8 October : According to Fedex tracking , the defective printer was received by Epson 's replacement center on 30 Sep , 2 days after I shipped it . That was last Friday ; today 's Saturday , 8 days later , and I still have n't received my replacement unit . Not good , so far.11 Oct . Still have n't received the replacement . I called Epson . Apparently they were out of stock , and the replacement unit shipped on 7 Oct , with a scheduled delivery date of 13 Oct.13 October . The replacement unit arrived . Finally.14 October . I 'm setting the printer up . Interestingly enough , the replacement printer did n't come with ANY instructions or documentation , and I 'd sent back the instructions I received with the original printer . I guess they remove anything other than the actual printer when they send it out as a replacement unit . Bad form . Fortunately , I remember what I did last time.Initialization of the unit takes about 14 minutes . This gets the ink flowing , etc . I 'm not using wireless , I 'm setting it up with a USB connection to my computer , which is an i7 running Win 7 64-bit , with tons of RAM.Okay , now that it 's connected to my computer , it turns out there are no inherent Windows drivers for this unit , and I have my OS completely updated . I have to download the drivers from Epson 's website and install them . VERY time-consuming because of hung installations ! Again , there was no disc in the box . I ca n't recall whether there was in the first unit I got ( if so , they went back to Epson ) , but there is n't one in the box I now have.Okay , the first installation attempt failed . Trying again . Second attempt failed again ; it seems to hang at the `` scan setup '' . I had to uninstall what it had installed ( through the Control Panel ) and start again.Well , third time 's the charm . The printer 's connected , installed , and works great . So let 's talk about the actual printer now.This is a pretty big unit , but its footprint is almost exactly the same as the HP 7580 it 's replacing ; it 's just taller because of the second feed tray , an option that 's also available on that HP model . So the size is basically the same.It works beautifully ! Fast , quiet , and terrific quality on documents . For photos , the quality is about the same as the printer it was replacing : good enough for most user applications like family albums , greeting cards , and other prints up to 8 '' X 10 '' . Are the prints good enough for professional display ? No , probably not , but for that kind of use you 're going to have a pro-level photo printer capable of larger formats anyway . It took 2 minutes and 40 seconds to print out an 8 `` X 11 '' print at best quality . That 's a big print , and the quality was quite good.Further , the Epson inks have a great deal of longevity , important if you want archival properties in your photos ( fade resistance ) .The two-sided capability will prove very useful , but that was also available as an optional hardware add-on with my HP , so it 's not like it 's anything unique.In conclusion , a very good printer . Is it cheap ? No way . But you get what you pay for , and I think the quality and capabilities of this printer justify the price . Minus star for the first unit being defective , and the slow replacement . 3 - 4 stars .	-1
Before purchasing I did extensive research on multifunction inkjet printers - after a few disasters with HP products it appeared that Epson had a quality advantage so I switched brands - this printer never has produced the superior photo printing that was expected as advertised - recently it has started leaking yellow ink on every page printed in a variety of globs and stripes - most of the recent negative reviews are about this yellow ink problem with some claiming puddles of ink appearing under the printer - since this printer is now out of warranty the only option I have is to feed it to the dumpster and start my research for a replacement all over again - because of past history with flawed HP printers I am not sure which brand to try next - I would highly recommend you DO NOT buy this printerUPDATE - FEB 2014Epson graciously replaced this printer - the replacement does everything so much better it makes me think that my original printer was flawed from the start - this is what I expected from Epson when I purchased the original WP-4540 - the color printing is spot on and no yellow ink dripping !	-1
This printer takes up quite a bit of space and is very heavy . My normally calm UPS deliveryman and I struggled to get the box to fit through my front door . Once in , however , it was pretty easy to set up . I set it up wirelessly from the beginning , with only a small amount of confusion . There is a 15 minute set-up period , and it does not come with a USB cord , but , once set up , I have found this easy to use . The quality is excellent . What I tried in `` economy '' mode was not very impressive , but the regular mode worked well . The quality of color copies was also quite good . Particularly noteworthy is how fast this is to start up and print . It is impressively speedy . In sum , an excellent choice for those with a big place to keep it . And I do mean , a big place to keep it.Eta : I am severely downgrading my rating with the disappointing realization that the ink cartridges must be used constantly or they dry out , and do n't last for many pages when used , and each of the 4 cartridges ( genuine ) is at least $ 20 each . Far too giant to be useless so quickly .	-1
This review concerns printing only . I use a different printer for FAXing . I wanted to buy an inkjet printer with high resolution . I previously owned a Canon i9900 , but had to toss it after a few years . The Epson 4530 is a big printer with lots of intelligence . However , whenever I tried to print with photo paper loaded into the front tray , the printer kept telling me it was out of paper , or a paper jam.Here 's the problem : this printer has a rear ( vertical ) feed and a front paper tray . If you try to print photo paper in the front tray tray , the printer will hang up . Or give you error messages . It accepts only plain paper.If you have the rear tray open , the printer will give you an `` out of paper '' or `` paper jam '' message . I find this a major nuisance.When I buy a printer I want it to be user friendly . I do n't want to fuss over everything I need to print . If you want a simple printer , look elsewhere .	-1
Here is my original review of this product : ( see below for my important updates ) : This printer is fast and efficient . I was impressed with the nice , vivid colors that it prints . It is super easy to set up/install . I love that you do n't even need to plug it into your computer - you can just use your wi-fi . You can print from mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads . The ink that comes with the printer can print about 1000 pages ( 900 with color ) . ( And of course , you can purchase higher-capacity ink cartridges to print even more . ) The paper cassette holds about 300 sheets or more . I love the 2-sided printing feature - and it is fast ! The scanning/copying features work great . I feel like this printer has the capabilities of a large office copier/printer , but on a slightly smaller scale for home use.I have been wanting to get a laser printer for some time , knowing that they are more efficient if you print a lot of pages . I feel like I change out my ink SO often that my inkjet printer was a waste of money . Now I do n't need a laser printer - my Epson is super efficient and cost-effective . I love that I can have the ability to print a lot of things in color , and still save money on my printing.Highly recommended printer ! ***UPDATES***Ok , so as you can see I really did love this printer . I printed TONS and tons of things with this , lots and lots of full-color printouts and lots of black and white pages with text . I have had it just over a year . All of a sudden , something goes wrong and there is yellow ink spilled ALL over the inside of the printer . Everything I print out has this big leaky yellow stripe all down the middle of the page . After googling the problem and looking online , it turns out that MANY others have had this exact same issue ( always with the yellow ink ) . I called Epson customer service and they were very nice , but because my printer was past the warranty they could not do anything except recommend I get it serviced . They said that my printer is basically characterized as having HARDWARE FAILURE . They did give me a discount on their website for purchasing a new one , if that is cheaper than getting this one serviced . I would be really wary of purchasing this same printer again , which is really a shame because I got such great use out of it and did love it for a year . Be aware that soon after your warranty is up , your printer will fail .	-1
I received this Epson WorkForce Pro WP-4530 All-in-One Printer from the Amazon Vine program for review . First I must say it was very simple to set up straight from the box . The instructions were clear and easy to follow . Our 12 year old son was able to complete most of this with assistance from my husband.The initial test prints were quick and clear , with vibrant and bold colors . It scans quick & clear.I must admit this printer takes up more space than I expected . I understand ans expect a high performance printer will be larger than an average everyday home printer ; however with technological advances rendering electronics smaller each year , I did expect a more compact unit . Be sure to check the dimensions for your work-space . Product Dimensions : 18.2 x 16.5 x 13.4 inches.This includes 4 separate cartridges / replacements are listed below : XL Black Ink Cartridge T676XL120XL Cyan Ink Cartridge T676XL220XL Magenta Ink Cartridge T676XL320XL Yellow Ink Cartridge T676XL420Considering these are extra large cartridges hopefully they will last a long time before needing replacements or refilling . I will update later when they start running out.So far I am very pleased with this Epson printer . Next on my list of task to try on this printer is connecting to my iPhone . I will update with the results . **Also no card reader on this printer.Update 11/19/2011 : I have just placed an order for a black replacement cartridge . I 'm hoping the replacement lasts much longer than the initial cartridge did . I 'm starting to have a few issues with this printer . Most noticeable is frequent paper jams , and extra pages being fed . For the past week , I have had numerous jammed paper , which is easy enough to clear , just remove the back and pull out the paper . But I am wondering why this is happening.The other issue I am starting to see is with clarity of images . This printer has never liked working with any photo papers , but it did ok , at first . Now the photos are coming out and they look as though the printer was shaking as it printed , with some minor blurring on random parts of the image.Not sure yet if this can be corrected , but I 'm trying . I 'm downgrading this to 3 stars , its OK , just not the greatest printer I 've owned.Update 12/15/2011 : Paper jams happen nearly every time I print . Photo print quality is not good at all , very blurry results . I tried a few different photo papers with no luck . My best results was normal print settings on photo paper . If I set high quality I had puddles of ink that literally ran over the page.Occasionally I find that normal print jobs appear blurry in places , almost as if you shook the printer while printing.Downgrading the stars again to 2 , its a real disappointment .	-1
When you first hear about this Epson multi-function , it looks great and promises a lot . The Print , scan , copy , fax , and wireless functions all sound really great . It has a superb scanner , that works well when scanning to a USB drive and the resolution is superb . The general printing capabilities work well for while , but then they go wacky and replacing the cartridges is a waste of time . When I kept on trying and trying to set up the wireless , I thought it was something I was doing wrong , but I followed the directions and the epson would not connect to the local wireless network , even though every other unit I have connects easily . The Air Print fails totally , and it is very disappointing . Most of the basic printing works well for a while , but then it fails . Overall , if you want a short term printer , that can scan very well after the printing fails ( and you get Fair to intermittent Faxing capabilities that work better with a fax modem ) . Some Epson 's work very well , but this one just fails after a few months use .	-1
Printer worked flawlessly for 6 months. -- was a real trooper . Then it jammed , made a very loud noise , and never fed a sheet of paper again . Epson 's idea of customer service was I should pay nearly what the printer cost to have it repaired , or to offer me a discount on a new printer . I think I 'll buy my next printer from a company that can make a printer that does n't break when it jams . Overall I think when you consider the cost of ink , the cost of the printer , and how few pages I printed before it died , I 'd say it cost me at least $ 1/page .	-1
These labels would be AWESOME if the template worked properly . They did not smudge and they stick well . HOWEVER , the template prints off-center so that the text is not centered and the background color does n't fill the whole circle . It looks so unprofessional that I threw away the ones I printed . I 'll keep them in case I have time one day to fiddle with the template to make it correct , or have a use for them that does n't have to look professional , but otherwise it 's pretty disappointing . I printed them with the label paper facing both ways ( top in and bottom in ) and both times it printed incorrectly . I do n't know what others are doing differently , because it gets good reviews .	-1
I bought these to print information for my son 's birthday party invitations ( homemade ) . But , even though they are advertised as working with printers , they were too thick to run through the auto or manual feed of my Brother laser jet printer . So , I ended up handwriting on them .	-1
REVIEW EDITED AND UPDATED AFTER FURTHER USE.These labels would be perfect for crafts or small business labeling if the templates were even partially acceptable . The labels seem to be pretty durable and attach securely and easily to whatever surface you choose . The only problem I have with these labels is the templates , which are terrible and do n't line up as they should . I have noticed that the print is not centered when I use centered printing , and designs with circles around the edge of the labels print with the circle off-center and usually cut off.The templates that you download and use on your computer are completely useless and Avery should be ashamed for providing them . The only way to get a decent label is to use their online label program , but I have n't figured out how to make it do less than a full page of labels.I am using a Mac with Lion and Microsoft Office 2011 , so everything is the newest with the latest updates , so I do n't think that the issue is with my computer , but rather the template.Look somewhere else for labels , as these are not worth even half the price .	-1
These tags look better in the photos than they actually are . The cardstock is not as heavyweight as I 'd expected it to be . The tags themselves look rather bland - a hint of gloss might have improved their appearance . The microperforations around the edges are also very visible - the photos on the packaging are misleading and have the perforations removed . Overall , the tags look cheap . I initially thought that I could use them to tag homebaked goods that I sell , but I feel that they cheapen the marketability of my products .	-1
I have used and reviewed a lot of Avery products over the years , and I have to say , the Avery Printable Tags are not one of my favorite product additions . I especially do not like the weight of the paper . It is a bit flimsy and very bland -- just flat white thin card stock . Unless you are adding a lot of colorful graphics , there is no pop to the tag . I am also not a fan of the strings that come with the tags . While it is a nice touch to add them to the package , I would never use them . If you are going to go to the trouble of making homemade tags , I would certainly hope you would use something a little nicer to attach the tag to the package . The locking mechanism is made of cheap looking plastic and the strings look like a very finely woven rope . And also of note , you do not get a clean edge when you separate the product at the perforation . You have tiny paper fibers that surround the edges so you do not get a crisp look . Formatting is also an issue . It is important to note that I use a MAC , and there are MAC issues when trying to format tags like this . While I understand you can go to the Avery website and download templates , it adds to the already time consuming process of designing the tag , and there is a learning curve to the Avery software templates . If you are in a hurry , this would not be a project I recommend starting.On the plus side , Avery is still committed to the Box Tops for Education program and has a coupon on the package . And the packaging is recyclable so you are not putting more waste into a landfill . It also offer a toll free number to call if you run in to a problem and gives you a website option to help design your tags . But those positives do not make this one of the quality products I have come to depend on from Avery , and I will not be buying this product again .	-1
I got these with the intention of packaging homemade christmas presents . However , I never did . The label area was a bit smaller than I had expected . Also the bags are either too small or too big for what I was making ( various jewelry , or sewn and knitted items ) . I also wonder why the description online said that it was not to be used for food items . There was nothing on the actual packaging , that I could find , that said that it was not for use for food items . I wish that was clarified on the packaging . I wanted to use them for the chocolate caramel turtles I make every year , but not knowing *why* it gives the warning , I decided not to .	-1
I wish I could give this a negative amount of stars . I wanted this to run through a printer to stick on party invitations . But , they are too thick .	-1
I feel bad giving these low marks . It is VERY nice to have ANY product that is even slightly more eco-friendly than similar products . The stickers are a nice size , nice quality . HOWEVER ... .the template site needs some tweaking . Unless all the stars in the heavens are aligned correctly , the Avery template probably wo n't work for you.First I went to the website that the pack indicated . Right off the bat , when entering my product number in the correct box , nothing . I had to go through the main search box . Then , the Avery Design and Print feature would not cooperate with my HP Touch , so I started the whole process over on my notebook . At least with the notebook I was able to navigate as far as selecting text . Still , NOT user friendly as other Avery templates are . What gives , Avery ? EDIT : I just read the other reviews , seems like I 'm not the only one with template issues , but at least they got farther than me , lol ! Unlike the other reviewer , I 'm on a PC . Also , they are not too dark , in my opinion . They are consistent with most unbleached kraft papers . I just used a few to close the plastic wrap on some home baked goods , they stuck well . Once on , they STAY , do n't think you can re-position them . Sadly , I used a sharpie to write as I still ca n't get that darn template to work for me .	-1
I just wasted a half hour of my life with these crappy labels . I have a good laser printer that use for professional work on many different paper weights , and I have never had feeding problems . These labels NEVER fed correctly . They slipped every time , probably because of the slick surface texture , so I ended up using the entire envelope up without a single correctly printed page . Most of the time the labels did n't even get up to the printing mechanism , because they slipped too much.And , with the few that I did get printed - although not positioned correctly on the label , because it had slipped in the printer - the ink smeared when I applied them to the jars , leaving them mostly unreadable . And yes , I even waited after the labels came out to be sure the ink was set . Still , the slick surface texture would n't take the ink , so they smeared if touched.They say they are water resistant , but they are n't even dry finger resistant.Unacceptable .	-1
I did buy this at Best Buy on sale however the current price on line is cheaper now . I absolutely love this printer . It printed 200 very detailed invitations and all the edges where also printed ( no borders of white ) ... printed on white cardstock . I went through 2 colored packs and 1 black and 1 extra cyan color ( navy blue theme ) on the highest quality setting and no borders plus a lot of preview prints before the final invitation creation was decided on . I got some ink on amazon for cheaper then in the stores that I looked at Target Walmart Best Buy . Best Buy is the most expensive for the ink ... Target was close to Amazon pricing but listed at on sale the day I looked . I should mention I used one package of the colored in 127 and one in the 126 ... I do n't know the difference but I saw somewhere it said the 126 has less ink . Which maybe why I ran out of the cyan so fast when I had the 126 cyan in the printer.I also have used this constantly for my Dad to print double-sided for copies of he business papers , tax forms and other forms we need to keep on file . It has only jamed once and that was because I did n't set the printer to the correct setting I had it on paper with only text and it was a paper that had a picture on it ... which did warm me to change the setting but I failed to read it until I tried printing that paper again ! I am now trying to print my return address on the large greeting cards and have yet to find how to put it to that setting . It only lets me do envelopes at a 5.5 to 8.5 when I need it to be 5.75 x 8.5 . I tried printing one at that setting and it does not look good . I will read online to see if I can find a way to do it . Which by the way Epson has these videos that you can watch that let you actually see on your computer which parts to click on for different projects ! I lost my direction book and found the one for doing double sided printing and it was easy as can be ! Easy installation ! You can go on-line and watch how to do that before you actually attempt it if you worry you might screw it up ! I did because I hate fixing my dumb mistakes ! I was glad I did ! I gave it 4 stars because it has been difficult to see how to print those one envelopes and also my Dell Printer which only prints black ink and the colored ink part broke right after warranty ... why I got this one , does copy much better pictures and also is easier to figure out . I do n't like how this Epson works for making picture copies and the pictures just do n't look right . I will keep my Dell for that picture scanning reason ! Keep in mind that I may not have it at a correct setting so do n't let that stop you from buying this printer . Look it up on the Epson site first to see if you can change the settings . I do n't care for right now ! 1 year after purchase ... printer was working great except that I could never get the bottom paper drawer to work for me which meant I had to go replace my top tray of regular paper with the specialty paper I needed on occasion . Now to the `` hate it '' part . I spent $ 100 plus a ton of money on ink on this printer and after the year has gone by with not a lot of use but at least 2 reams of paper used in that year . It jammed and when I went to read the directions on how to pull it out then after following the steps to remove the paper jam it did n't print nice anymore so I read how to fix that and followed the directions for all of those tests to run to fix the issue . Nothing worked and it was past the warranty . My computer person said it would cost half the price of the printer to get it fixed and since it was so big and you could n't even use the bottom part and it did n't print nice pictures I opted to get a new printer.Funny thing is I read every review on amazon and found these complaints within the really great reviews .	-1
I have a relatively new Canon MX860 multi function all in one ( I think I got it about three years ago ) that I 've been itching to replace . The Canon works well ( and works VERY well with my Macs ) but it has started to print slowly and I 've always wanted to get a printer that had a bit more economical print costs ( the Canon burns through ink tanks quickly and they are very expensive for the number of pages you get ) as well as the ability to print from my growing number of Apple iDevices ( it 's a bit of a novelty , but there have been times I 'm doing something on the iPad and would like to print a receipt or hard copy ) .I narrowed my search down to this Epson Workforce 845 , or one of the HP multi-functions . As I 've had very bad luck with HP drivers and support in the past , I decided to purchase the WorkForce 845 since a local retailer had it on sale for the very reasonable price of $ 140 ... I was leery though because I had read many mixed things about Mac support from Epson.Well , it turns out those fears are well founded . I have a relatively new iMac running OS X 10.7 Lion . My wife has a Macbook Pro 17 '' running OS X Snow Leopard.Initially I was pretty happy ... setting the printer up was relatively easy ( I just added the printer when it was discovered on the network and let OS X do the rest ) and was up and running in no time . I let OS X download and install the latest available drivers for the printer.The problems began when I wanted to do anything other than basic print and scan with the printer ... for example , make use of the `` scan to PC '' and `` scan to PC PDF '' buttons on the front of the printer . I 've always used these functions on the Canon and find them fairly indispensable . When I choose scan to PC on the WorkForce I simply get a choice for USB . I figured that I must simply be missing the needed software , so I downloaded the full software package from Epson and installed everything as well as updated the printer firmware to the latest version.Still no choice for printing to the Mac from the Epson . Also , I observed that the Epson scan package is very very primitive compared to what Canon makes available for their printers ( Canon has a full scan/print/edit management suite called MPX Navigator that works FANTASTICALLY ) .I finally broke down and called tech support . The tech support guy tried to be helpful , but right from the start he acknowledged that the Epson software does not work fully with OS X 10.6 or 10.7 . What ? I can maybe see cutting a manufacturer a bit of slack for not supporting a new OS that 's less than a year old , but SL has been out for 2.5 years at this point.What 's even more mind boggling is that Epson clearly wants to court the Apple crowd by providing AirPrint support for iOS devices , but ca n't be bothered with providing full function support for Macs ? You know , the Apple devices that might actually do a decent volume of printing in your average home ? The phone rep told me that the package needed for the network print to work is called Epson Event Manager . I asked him why this was not included in the large `` complete '' download of all of the software for the 845 and he told me `` well , there are still problems with Event Manager under SL and Lion '' .The rep walked me through downloading and installing this software , which promptly crashed on my Mac . Additionally , when it IS running , and I try to print from the panel of the Epson WorkForce I eventually get a message indicating `` communication error occurred '' . The rep tried a few things and then sort of stammered out that it does work for some Mac users , and not others , and it has to do with how the Epson software got installed/upgraded or how OS X got installed/upgraded . He honestly sounded thoroughly confused . What 's more , it did not work on EITHER Mac in the house , which sort of shoots some holes in the idea that there 's something wrong with my particular box causing the trouble.I also observed that even after following the Fax setup functions , the printer does n't seem to be able to Fax from my Macs , even though I can fax directly from the front panel just fine.All in all it seems as though Epson delegates Mac support completely to the back burner and it takes them months , if not years , to fix issues , if they ever do . Also , comparing the software packages that are included from Canon to those that Epson includes is a bit of a laugh . The Epson stuff just flat out looks archaic compared to what Canon had on the market almost three years ago.The saddest part about all of this is that for just straight up printing and scanning ( from the PC with the scan app ) the printer works pretty well ... but , in all likelihood I will be returning it , because without full Mac support , I ca n't really keep this machine .	-1
