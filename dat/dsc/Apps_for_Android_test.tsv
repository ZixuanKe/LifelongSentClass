Thanks to the creator of this game , I am having so much fun with this I play out in my sleep .	1
Slow start , still lots of fun ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I did n't think it would be so addictive . It 's so easy to play !	1
The game is fun , addictive and a great way to pass the time . Android is best . The kindle crashes a lot and gets a little buggy but if the kindle is all you have great . My word of advise is do not try to level up quickly or it gets harder later , ( I have this game on two devices ) , slow and steady works best . Even on the kindle the game is great	1
I am really enjoying this game . It does move pretty slow without spending real money . Add me as a friend . Kiddbats	1
One of the better building games I have tried worth PLAYING if you like these kind of gamesTry it	1
So far I 'm enjoying this game . Not sure if connected to Facebook or not . Seems to be problem with all my games from GIGL . Hopefully , someday it will be fixed . I need friends tho ... ..Frankensue is my name . Anyone ?	1
Very fun game . I only have one problem , it 's far too hard to add friends . Add jjjtammy .Other than that get this app we ca n't play megapolis on the kindle but this game comes pretty close .	1
This is a very fun game . It is sort of like SIM city in that you build your own city , but you also grow crops and create goods to sell .	1
Must be patient to grow city beyond certain point without using real money . If you need friends add me Vicki 0919 .	1
I want sure how much I would like this game , but it 's pretty interesting . Its one of those games that keeps you moving and trying to keep up with everything that 's going on at the same time .	1
This game is really fun but some times it freezes and then says that you lost on the flirt game and it gets very very very very very very very very annoying .	1
This game is pretty cool because we would be able to go shopping and other cool stuff . But the items such as clothes and costumes are really expensive	1
Sometimes , when I try to win at the night club , it freezes completely . If this was fixed , the game would be perfect !	1

I like this game it 's fun . I was thinking since there was other versions of star girl there should be a sports star girl . Like hockey and other sports that also have jerseys ( NOT EXPENSIVE ) I 'm a hockey fan and I think it would be cool to have a sports star girl for everyone even the ones who LOVE sports . I always wanted there to be a sports star girl that would be cool an interesting.BTW my I 'd for star girl beauty queen is 3XJNA add me please.Anyways i like this game it 's fun . I HOPE there will be a sports star girl I would get it right away . ( IF FREE )	1
i really enjoy participating in the community events and playing the mini games . i do wish there was some type of social forum to find friends in-game . i am almost thirty , i should n't like this game so much ! My ID in-game is BS3KJ Feel free to add me !	1

Simply the best app for girls who love fashion games ! This game is so addictive.It 's hard to put down because want to your aviator to become successful in all aspects of her life ! I 've taken over my daughter 's kindle to play this app ! Star girl beauty queen has it all career choices in fashion , entertainment and she earns her own way ! Then there 's the dating which I have my own hang-ups about , only because of her inviting guys home from this coffee shop she frequents then if the date goes well , they give her material items at the end of the date ( bad message ) ! But , you Oshould monitor your younger girls on any app they play right ! Oh , and there are more challenges too play to earn more diamonds to build your girl 's wardrobe , upgrade boyfriends and town 's of other stuff ! Definitely a app to try for any who loves being a girl !	1
This game is an amazing time killer . It is a fun game but the only problem is the loading screen . It goes and loads then it goes back two times and right when it 's in the middle of loading it stops . You have to wait one minute and it loads . Other than that it is good .	1
I love it it is so awesome . I saw my friends ( they all have kindle fires ) playing it and i decided to get it . So i say GET ITTTTTTT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Add me i am N8YNE	1
It is a fun game . perfect for girls that like fashion and picking out specific things for their character . Is also good because it teaches about jobs and money	1
i love but it wont let me enter or go to the fashion compition and im getting really mad amd sooner pr later of it does not work soon im going to delete it .	1
I 've ben waiting for this version of the game for more than a year ! It 's where you can go against real people and see who 's the real Star girl ! This game is really fun .	1
Ok ... .I had star girl # 1 I was a noob there you know I only had the clothes they gave me ... so when I downloaded this one it recognized me and I had ALOT OF GOOD EXPENSIVE CLOTHES and hair , shoes , shirts , shirts even skirts ! I 'm a critic in games ... but this one is a 5 STAR blowout !	1
I like this app cuz you can have boyfriend 's but they only give you three gifts that 's the only thing I do n't like about the game the rest I like . You can date famous doys tThey only give you three gifts too they are cute they only call you one s nd a while for a date ... . well by hope you like it	1
I LOVE THIS GAME , I PLAY MOST EVERY DAY.THERE ARE FEW THINGS I WOULD CHANGE ABOUT IT.I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROLL THE COLOR OF THE EYES FOR THE EYE SHAPE I PICK . I DO FIND THIS GAME A GREAT WAY TO RELAX . IF YOUR THINKING OF GETTING THIS GAME , DEFINATELY DO , YOUR BE HAPPY YOU DID .	1

Please add me 32P7H . This game is totally cool ! I love how you can earn points on jobs to get an award ! I think that kids above 6 years will like this the most . There are awesome styles ! If you go to the bar and win the minigame Flirt In First Sight , there is a 50 percent chance you will see a celebrity ! And you will see the rest when you download this game !	1
J6RVE is my code for this . I had a star girl but it got erased so I had to start a new one so I 'm not very far but I love this game so much I probably will be on it a lot so add me plz ! ! Thanks ! ! ! ! ! ! I love this game it 's fun and this is the upgrade to that original star girl , now u can compete in comps ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
All you people are stupid when you put one star . Your stupid because you say the boys are real but there obviously fake ! The boys are fake . It 's not like you can kiss them . All they do is give you gifts . And flirt in first sight sure the girl your competing with has a bikini but that 's the way the game is . And the flirt button is just a button ! You keep pressing it till he 's your boyfriend . All you people with one star are crazy . This app is clearly for all ages . You may think not to trust a random person but take my advice . I 've been here for a long time . I 'm level 237 . And the competing . Some reviews say it just teaches little kids to be drama kids . The Fashion competition is just a fun way to express kids style and share there look with others . Another thing people are arguing about is that random people keep friending your children . It 's rather because when you make a review you say your id . Or because people are lonely and add random ids . I think I 've solved all the problems angry people have been complaining about . This app is for all ages.This app is like the little kids version of movie star plannet . Although star girl does n't have hackers . If you have movie star plannet and you made a review about it if you put on star I do agree with that . To many hackers like the dolly	1
Real fun game . I enjoy it a lot . You will like it trust me ! Buy it everyone who sees this	1
It is the best game ! I am famous and the next star girl ! You should get it you will have a lot of fun !	1
BEST GAME EVER ! ! ! ! ! LOVE IT GET IT ! Yes I said it I LOVE IT AHHHHHH TOTAL GET IT PLEASE ! ! ! !	1
Why I gave it five stars is because of the games of it and I like all the jobs and awards .	1
This is a pretty okay game , nothing to write home about . It 's a good time waster . I would like it more if a lot of the items did n't take so many gems to purchase but oh well . Add me : NT74Z	1
This app is awesome but ... just let me tell you my story . Ok one day I got regular old star girl then star girl stopped working . So I got star girl beauty queen I had 316,409 money and 204 diamonds and I was at level 31 so I decided to see my old profile on regular star girl and I was poor on regular star girl and I was at level 18 so I went back on star girl beauty queen and ... .my old star girl profile was on star girl beauty queen and all my money and levels and clothes are down the drain ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : ( so if you have regular star girl then DONT PLAY IT but you should really get star girl beauty queen its fun .	1
The features of this app are wonderful . The readings are free , UNTIL you get past the first couple of the most basic ones . ( Good , but basic . ) The illustrations are lovely , the operational features are fun , and it is something more than I have seen in other apps for the Kindle Fire HD . Very highly recommended ! LOTS of FUN ! ! But , be aware that for the longer and more detailed readings , you need to pay more ... Just remember , you are starting out for FREE , and the extras are sooooo very worth it .	1
If your not sure what the lenormand is all about this is a good start before you go buying a deck	1
One of my favourites !	1
Quite often I get bored with games quickly because they are n't challenging enough . This game is very good because it just gets harder and harder but there are goals you can strive for . The only thing I do n't like is the & # 34 ; helps & # 34 ; that you have to buy . It is just too easy to fall into the trap of buying the & # 34 ; helps & # 34 ; instead of working hard to figure the word out .	1
I really loved this game so much , I keep looking for similar games to keep my mind sharp and challenged .	1
Would need more hints when we are stuck . Still very addictive . Big exercise for memoryWould highly recommend it .	1
I love this game , but I am terrible at it . How can you possibly get a high score in such a short amount of time ? Great to play with family and friends on devices .	1
This is just another way to enjoy my xbox 360 entertainment . It really is just a more fun and more challenging version of words with friends . Plus , you get xbox achievements .	1
I 'm so happy the Wordament has finally been available for Kindle . l have enjoyed it on my iPod , but on Kindle it 's so much bigger ! I have been waiting for a about a year ! This is my favorite game . One glitch , though , it crashes at times .	1
If you like finding words under pressure then you 'll enjoy playing this game . I have played this game over & over & have found it to be challenging every & each time .	1
I 've been playing this game for a couple of years on my Windows phone and I love it . It 's great to have it on my Kindle . It 's easy to play and each game only lasts 2 minutes so it 's fun to do when you do n't have much time ; you can play a game or two . Highly recommended for anyone who loves word games .	1
I 'm a workaholic so this game is right up my alley . My one quibble would be that it 's slow between games .	1
This game is loads of fun and colors ! They give you apples every hour so you can keep on playing without having to wait for the time to be up , like so many other games . The faster , you get the higher your score ! Get this game now !	1
This game is alot like the other bingo games offered in the Kindle . The game cards are easy to read and the pace of the caller is good .	1
I love this game , I could play bingo all day long . To bad we ca n't earn more bingo chips or keys . Very addictive .	1
This App lets me listen to Music Free and Im A huge Adam Lambert Fan Everything thing is free it all goes straight to my music folder on my kindle fire .	1
This is a great app I love it and I would recommend this app to al music lovers ! ! enjoy your app	1
I was so thrilled to learn this app is available for Android now ! I have used it in my kindergarten classroom and ALL of my kids love it ! I love how it breaks down the words phonetically then explains and illustrates the definition of the word after the sounds are correctly placed . Vowels transition from long to short sounds , based on how they are used in a word.Another great feature is that words are updated regularly and the library is constantly growing ! I simply ca n't say enough about how wonderful and engaging this app is.In my opinion , this is worth every bit of the $ 4.99 they are asking .	1
Grand daughter is autistic , she tends to move from game to game and does not always play with them appropriately . However , this game keeps her attention , and she seems to really play with it in the manner for which it is designed . She loves letters and repeats the words she is forming with the letters . She has a speech delay and has sensory issues . I think this game is helping her with both . I love this game and am happy I bought it .	1
MY 2-1/2 year old granddaughter loves the game and has been playing it for over a year already . It has taught her letter recognition and pronunciation at a very early age , which can only be considered a good thing . Therefore I give this game my highest recommendation .	1
My grand baby is not yet 2 , she can only say a few words but among those are a few letters . This is great for her . She is able to move the letters into their spots . While moving , the letters make their sounds . Then when she places them , we hear the name of the letter . When the word is complete there is a little video of the word.I enjoy this app also , especially compared to others for kids this age . I suspect the app would be best for toddlers up to early preschool . However , some of the words are pretty advanced - so perhaps older kids would enjoy it , too.This app is not on my Kindle , it is on hers ( registered to her Mom ) but I have played it with her many times .	1
Fun and entertaining . The letters are big and the monsters are cute . It is similar to the Counting Game & # 34 ; Mini Monsters & # 34 ; . Both are cute and have more to the eye than you think .	1
Good learning game , but we wish there were updates to add more words .	1
Simply put , this is the ONE app you need if you have a toddler or kindergartner . Seriously one of the best apps of any kind that I have ever come across . Simple and genius . Good job guys.Well worth the cost .	1
On my Nexus 7 this looks great and really capture 's my little one 's attention . It seems to do better when launched from Zoodles kid mode but it still crashes occasionally . I ca n't let my little one play without it locked somehow . If it did n't crash I 'd give it 5 stars easily.Update 5/11/14 : I switched over from Kids Place to Zoodles Kid Mode and the app has not crashed enough for my kids to complain . Both my 4 year old and my 20 month old love it so much I had to come back and raise my review . They both get giddy when they play it . My 4 year old already knows all of his letters but he still loves it because it is so silly .	1
EDIT : I have uninstalled , deleted from cloud , repurchased and redownloaded and the game is now working perfectly on my KFire HD 8'9 ! ! Thank you Amazon and BigFish ! I bought the full version immediately and am so happy to be able to play this game again , as the only laptop the PC version of this game worked on recently crashed.This installment of MCFiles is disturbing and dark as it dives deeper into the demented inner world of Charles Dalimar . As he takes us on a virtual tour of his life , from childhood to adulthood , we discover what made him the twisted soul he is . The game 's hidden object scenes differ from other games of this type in that you look for morphing objects instead . You 'll either love it or hate it . I personally love it . You also get to look for more morphing objects in your journal to unlock a bonus game . The puzzles are interesting and just challenging enough . The graphics , sound , acting and music just as awesome as in other MCF games.Be warned that this game deals with very disturbing themes and is not for the faint hearted or squeamish ! Older review , no longer applicable : This game does not work on my kindle fire HD 8'9 . As other reviewers I get a black screen right after the bigfish and dogbots logos . Very disappointed ! Edit : Tried it on my Kindle Fire 1st generation and no luck either . Black screen . Bah !	1
I played the first version of this game about a year ago . I loved it . I knew I would love this one too .	1
Wowee ! ! This game is quite tough but what a great plot with unpredictable twists and turns . If you like a challenge and love to be entertained , look no further ! ! You will easily become immersed ! Good luck !	1
I played this on a Kindle Fire . No problems , great story line and I even gagged numerous times while cleaning up & quot ; mother & quot ; . So gross . Ca n't wait to tell my sister about it . I liked the morphing so much better than the normal hidden object games . Just when I thought it cldnt get better it did . Insane asylum . And what 's w those freaky pregnant women ? Worth every penny .	1
This game is a challenge , love it , not all seek and find which I hate . The only thing I hate is the fact I own it already along with every game on download on my computer . But I love playing it on my kindle . No glitches , just a long wonderful saga . Worth the price . I want more..	1
I was a bit concerned when I saw the other reviews but I loved the other chapters and chanced it . I loved this game ! The graphics , storyline and sound effects are A+ . The super creepy locations , characters and videos were nice change from the norm and exactly what I have come to expect from Big Fish . Morphing games were different and were a challenge . However , the long game play , creepy storyline and interactive videos made this well worth the purchase . I hope we see more of this quality very soon . Well done !	1
.Great game . If you like hidden items . I few twist from other hidden games I 've played . I would recommend it .	1
This is one of the best Big Fish mystery adventure games I 've ever played ! ! ! I 'm disappointed that I ca n't unlock it ! ! ! ! The HO scenes are cool because instead of finding objects you find morphing items ! Keep these games coming Big Fish ! I 'll buy every one of them ! ! !	1
This game is very challenging . I like the story line . All the Ravenhearst games are great . I really love the hidden object aspect as well as figuring out what to do . The only drawback is there were not any directions for the games .	1
I have to say this is the toughest , longest game I have played from Big Fish yet . Trust me I have most of them . The morphing area 's are a nice twist from hidden object 's Really pay attention they are shuttle changes , no penalty for using Hints and I needed them at times ; ) also needed the walkthrough at times even with the guide . The buttons for the water chambers in the hub only had a couple of tough times . The nurse on the tv monitor , change the dial and then match ... . it is the guards buttons on the last one . DEFINATELY WORTH THE COUPLE OF $ for this game . Have fun and do not get to scared by the graphics ... screams ... taunts !	1
Just ordered this game . Enjoing it , good plot and hidden objects . Challenging mini games and good story line . Try it .	1
I am really enjoying the hidden objects games right now and I must admit this one is a bit hard , but I will keep working on it .	1
I love this game and people need to try this game and give it 5stars . it definately is an adventure . not to hard and not too easy .	1
This game was really good , but also a repeat of Web of Deceit : Black Widow , although an entirely different story . Also more gothic than WoD . Anyway , the game is well put together and mostly makes sense . The mini-games are fun and not too difficult . Again , Big Fish has lowered the price for this type of game , so you do n't have to pay a lot for the unlock . Was n't as buggy as WoD , so that 's a big plus . I would have given this 5 stars if I had n't played WoD first , but the game was about as long ( good ! ) With an added bonus chapter taken from the bad guys ' side . Good fun !	1
I have played many games of this sort and this one rates high on my list . Quite long and very enjoyable .	1
I love all of the big fish games and I 'm not ever disappointed the graphics are always great and the story line is always challenging.. My only issue with them is that they always take so long to release the next game 's ...	1
The story was long so I feel l t like I was getting my money 's worth . The different puzzled varied in difficulty , I did n't have to use the skip button often . I liked the challenges . Very enjoyable .	1
This is an amazing game . If you like adventure games with HO scenes and puzzles then you 'll love this game . Great story line , lots of places to visit and interesting puzzles to solve . I look forward to your next Fierce Tales game ! !	1
Pros : Creative tale with good graphics and music , well voiced characters , nice cutscenes . Long game with long bonus chapter where you play the bad guy.Cons : as others have noted , significant lag in scene changes , several times going to title 'Loading progress bar . My biggest gripe was the top of some mini-games was above the top of the display on my galaxy tab 2 7.0 - I had to visit the in-game guide to find the inputs for the roots ( pipes ) game as they could n't be seen .Overall , quite good .	1
IT IS LIKELY THAT I would have given this a 5 star rating ... unfortunately that is not the case . HAVE PLAYED THIS THREE TIMES AND NOW HAVE HAD TO START OVER AGAIN . THE FIRST TIME I Got caught up in the living room ... Finally had to remove progress ... The second time IENTERED THE LIGHTHOUSE WITH THE DOOR LATCH ... UPON RETURNING THERE THE LATCH WAS GONE . THE third TIME I GAVE THE SMELLING SALTS TOO LILY AND HER WORDS DID A DOUBLE WORD OVER AND I COULD NOT TAKE THE FLOWER FROM HER . GUESS THIS IS AN APP GLITCH WHICH I WILL REPORT . GUESS MY ONLY RECOMMENDATION IS PLAY CAREFULLY AND DONT MISS ANYTHING AS THIS GAME WILL NOT LET YOU PROCEED . IT IS RATHER ENJOYABLE BELIEVE IT OR NOT ! FINALLY FINISHED AFTER TRYING FOUR TIMES ... WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE GLITCHES , IT WAS PRETTY GOOD ... MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS DO NOT RUSH ANYTHING ... LIKE TAKING THE FINAL HO OBJECT OR LISTENING TO SOMEONE TALKING , ETC . ALSO , AGAIN DO N'T MISS ANYTHING OR YOU WILL NOT PROCEED .	1
BIG FISH DOES IT AGAIN . I ca n't say enough about this one . Great graphics . Great story line . This is one I could n't put down . Played into the wee hours of the morning . As been said , if you do n't like going back and forth a lot , you probably will not like this game . It 's a long play for the money and worth every dime . The only thing I could say negative about this one was the bonus chapter . Too short and sad ending . Because the rest of the game was outstanding I still give it a five star . If you 're a BLAM fan , try it . I will waiting for the next BIG FISH offer . In fact I 'm going to start looking now .	1
This is another fun Big Fish hidden object and puzzle adventure game , with lots of dogs . What could be better ? The graphics are first rate as usual , and solving the quests and moving through the game is smooth and fun . Some of scenes wo n't activate until you 've found the right clues or notes . There is some back and forth , but it 's not useless and annoying.Dog lovers will really enjoy this .	1
Big fan of big fish games about time still waiting for empress of the deep 3 , any way back to what I was saying love this game only problem is that it wo n't let me unlock the game you have 2 New big fish games that wo n't unlock can u please correct it continue with more of these games thank you	1
First of all , I love dogs ... all breeds and mutts , too . Have n't finished the game yet , but I determined to find out who is behind the cruelty of the & # 34 ; shock & # 34 ; collars and why ? ? ? I have played 50 or so games on my 1st gen.Kindle . No problems with this app . Good graphics and an interesting but not boring storyline and minigames . That is why I give it a 5 star rating .	1
As usual a great game by big fish ... long game..reasonable price 2.99 ... and a extra chapter in which you play the opposite of the story in which that was long..way too many hidden object games but if you in to that it 's for you ... great puzzles also..bought two other big fish games dropped them for this and it was worth it ... definitely a five star and more game..keep it coming big fish	1
I enjoyed this game , and finished it to the end . It has the regular hidden objects , puzzle solving and story that works to keepmy interest . I would recommend this game .	1
Did n't like k e the bouncing back n forth to the same at e as , Love the g5 games . Always intriguing . Love the hints .	1
I sincerely recommend it . It is not too short , nor too easy . It 's just good fun . It is well worth the price .	1
I absolutely love this game . in fact I am running out of games to play that are like this one ... make the seaual .	1
great game ! ! ! ! good value and the extra game is just awesome ... ..Big fish , way to go..mwaiting for the next game from you guys	1
I 'm bummed cause to finish the game I have to buy it . I thought it was a free game ? I was really enjoying it and then OH darn , I have to buy the ending ! Please , please let us know ( in a more conspicuous area ) that one has to buy the finish of the game .	1
Played on Kindle HD without any problems . Graphics were good , story line was good and just plain fun to play . Enjoyed the game very much !	1
Story is nice and the sequencing is nice . Wonder how much it costs ? I have had to use hints a couple times already .	1
I really enjoyed playing this game . I really got involved with it that I lose the track of time . I love how the hint button get up fast and get you going in the right direction . I was doing great and decided to pay $ 2.99 for the Full version and doing good until I reached the passage with the dogs blocking the path and hint button will recharge and say the same thing each time and there is where I am stuck . I don ` t know what to do next . But beside that it 's a great exciting game . So , the money I had to pay for the Full version was n't that bad . Better then $ 4.99 .	1
A different style story with dogs being involved in the plot . With a diary and hint button there is no reason to get stuck and frustrated . Great graphics . This is one of the few games I did n't have to delete .	1
This was a great game . It had a very interesting plot . It was hard enough to be challenging but not too frustrating . Worth the money .I had a really good time playing it .	1
This is the very best of the many games I have played . The graphic is great , the story line more interesting than most , everything works , the game is long but never gets boring . This is truly a masterpiece . Bravo to the development team ! This one is very , very hard to beat !	1
I am happy to say that this HO game was graphically great , puzzle perfect and a real pleasure to play . The game unlocked is $ 2.99 + tax . It 's well worth it for an HO game of this quality and length . So often , I 'm disappointed by how quickly a new game comes to an end , or with overly difficult puzzles throughout . Neither is a problem at all with this fantastic game . 'Fierce Tales ' has done a wonderful job of providing a story that is original in the HO gaming field . No ghosts or curses , just a series of odd events that become more intriguing as the game unfolds . There is also a lovely Extra chapter which focuses on the origins of the one man who becomes the central figure of the plot.The HO segments are great , with some calling on the gamer to use certain objects to put together an item to collect . The HO areas do get a bit hidden behind the list of items to collect , but expanding the size overcomes that small problem . The puzzles are neither overly simplistic nor are they difficult to the point of the ridiculous.Just good fun and entertaining without the annoyance of spending more than a game is worth . I hope others will enjoy 'Fierce Tales : Dog 's Heart ' as much as I did .	1
Wonderful art work . Very long game . I did n't like that it was n't always intuitive . I needed to use the hint button a lot to figure out where to go next . Overall I liked it .	1
I liked playing this game but some things were hard to find . I enjoyed the challenge and would get it again . You ca n't beat the price .	1
This game was the best game so far . Absolutely beautiful graphics and an amazingly new and fresh storyline . The length of the game was terrific . The bonus chapter was awesome . Big Fish did not disappoint me at all . Thank you to all who participated in the creation of this game . Keep them coming ! ! ! I am a huge fan of the Big Fish games and I truly love what you guys and gals do to keep fans like me happy .	1
again another awesome game from big fish . loved a story with the dogs . the puppies were a neat touch . loved the length . totally worth the money and time . keep them coming !	1
Once again big fish has given us a winner good characters , storyline , graphics , and plenty of mini games . Buy full version well worth it hours of fun .	1
The game started out great , but creepy . Enjoyed going through it . Had a bit of trouble navigating , buthint button helped lots when I got confused . Overall , I found it to be a great game.Bonus game was also enjoyable . A prequel to the game just played .	1
Big Fish does it again ! Gave us another hidden object mystery game with the best graphics , best audio & amp ; a unique storyline . I played on my kindle fire hd & amp ; had just one glitch ... in the bonus game , right after collecting the crocodile skin , the screen went black & amp ; game shut off . But all it took was to restart & amp ; recollect the skin . Nothing else was lost . So after playing for around ten hours ( for just $ 2.99 ) , with still more story ahead ... I was not concerned . You will like this game if you like hogs - there are quite a few plus mini puzzles . There is a lot of back & amp ; forth as you travel around town but the journal also includes a map . There is also a hint button that stays charged if you are using it to navigate the city . Otherwise , it charges in about 15 seconds in casual mode.With the long playtime ( over 2 hours before unlock ) , unique story ( got ta love Pippa & amp ; the bulldog ) & amp ; Big Fish as the developer , it 's a must have game !	1
I did n't experience any trouble downloading the APP . I have n't investigate it thoroughly but it looks just like the one I downloaded for my iPhone .	1
This is several Bible translations plus the Greek Interlinear plus additional study features rolled into an easy , fun to use app . The only feature I miss is the ability to bookmark . I 'm so happy it 's finally available for the Kindle !	1
This app is such a great addition to my tablet . I have my Bible wherever I go . We are truly blessed to be provided this app under Jehovah 's direction ! Thank you , brothers !	1
Thank you Jehovah and thank you governing body and everyone who works so faithfully on giving us our spiritual food ! I was raised in the truth but fell out almost 20 years ago . I 'm 31 now and have been praying for help and a peace of mind . Jehovah heard me and sent sisters out and they 've shown me all of new things and apps and it is so encouraging . I know longer have anxiety problems thanks to jw.org and this app and answered prayers . So much appreciation to all of Jehovah 's Witnesses . I love you all !	1
fantastic	1
This is the best app for doing research on religious topics and for reading the bible . One have the choice of reading a scripture from four translations . This app is excellent !	1
I am glad that this feature was available to be downloaded on my kindel . Of all my apps , this was the most important one for me . it is like a library in your hand , and it has so many different bibles translation on it .	1
This is one of the best bible apps ever ! ! Although I am not a Jehovah Witness , I find this a great source to use to read JW publications and so much more , It even has a feature to switch from one Bible translation to another .	1
I was not able to upload this to my Kindle tablet , but have been waiting for it for quite a while . Would love to have it when it is available then I can rate it from experience . I have other members of the family and friends who do have this app and they say how wonderful and helpful it is so now I am awaiting for it to be ready for my Kindle Fire HD . Please get it soon .	1
I rated it four stars because although I am thrilled about the Bible portion of the app ( and the fact that is the new revised edition ) , I am as yet unable to access anything further in the library . It will be 10 stars once we can draw up all the information the library has to offer !	1
Thank you for such a wonderful tool . I can carry the Bible ( 6 translations ) with me wherever I go . The new additions are icing on the top ! Really enjoy having the daily text and also the complete song book at my fingertips ; just wonderful .	1
Love it ... the pics in the appendix and the interactivity of this app makes it the best ! LOVE it ! Thank You !	1
A highly useful tool for all Christians who are actively engaged in the preaching and teaching work outlined at Matt . 28:19-20 .	1
Love it ! Has the Revised New World Translation and is in epub format . Also it has 5 other bible translations built into it so you can instantly see those translate that same verse . It also contains wonderful footnotes , and an outline of each of the Bible books at their beginning . Has many other features as well ... and in one word ... this thing is truly ... & # 34 ; awesome ! ! & # 34 ;	1
This is one of the best translations out there . We actually used this in Bible College- and it was n't a & amp ; # 34 ; JW & amp ; # 34 ; college . Glad to have found it !	1
great research tool and a quality app i particularly found it helpful with the charts and tables and contents secgions before each chapter the modern day english is good too	1
Beautiful translations of the NWT 2013 edition in several languages . It is great to have access without having to carry it with you .	1
This has 6 translations of the Bible on it and is wonderful for use at our meetings . Additionally , it has the Daily Text and JW Songbook for easy access at the KH .	1
I have been waiting for this app to become available for the Kindle . I was finally able to side load it but I did n't want to keep going through that process to get the updates . Thank you for making it possible through the Amazon site .	1
Anyone looking for an App for reading the Bible will love this one ! The interface is extremely simple and the search functions are excellent.While it is especially appealing to Jehovah 's Witnesses as many other reviews attest , it is important to note that the app also contains the KJV , the American Standard Version , the Byington Translation and the Kingdom Interlinear with the Greek text and English translation below each Greek word.So do n't think this app is only for Jehovah 's Witnesses ! Any serious Bible student will appreciate the value of this excellent free Bible program.For non Witnesses though , I would highly recommend comparing the NWT and the NWT Reference Bible to the rest - especially to the Interlinear . You will find the Reference Bible to be extremely true to the Greek text , and the NWT to be concise , accurate and very easy to understand !	1
I was so happy to see this available on AMAZON and I had not been able to download it from any other APP . THanks for making this available ! ! The program has everything that I need to locate Scriptures fast .	1
I LOVE THIS APP because it teaches every one about Jehovah God , and I think you should get this app and the best part is that it is free !	1
This is a wonderful app that everyone should have . It allows you to access the Holy Scriptures wherever you are .	1
This outstanding App is just what this technological world has been longing for . Jehovah wants us to draw close to him . Let scripture explain scripture ! Bible truth will set you free . Incredible App .	1
Dear Reader , It was very hard to download , although , the app was worth it . I did n't get to download it until about a month after the assembly.It has six ( 6 ) versions of the Bible . I use it all the time .Sometimes I use instead of my Bible , But not usually . It even has the Hebrew chart ! It has every part of every Bible.I have never given such a long review I will never ever delete it . I 'd rather delete everything on my Kindle , than delete this app.It is a wonderful gift from Jehovah , God .Thank You Jehovah . I love you Jehovah ! Sincerely , KLB	1
This app is WONDERFUL ! ! ! I use this app all the time . Helps with my instant research on my tablet . The best app I ever downloaded . It 's FREE , fast to download and easy to navigate to the scriptures . Thanks to Jehovah and all the hard work the brothers put into giving us a clear and accurate translation of God 's word .	1
Anyone who desires to read and understand the Bible should explore the many excellent features of this modern English translation .	1
It 's the Bible lovers dream . It allows you to compare the NWT ( 2013 revised edition ) with 5 other translations . Awesome . I particularly like the fact that the Greek scriptures have the Greek Interlinear as a translation to compare to .	1
As if getting the revised new world translation was n't amazing enough . I was n't sure if I could download at first because it said it was n't compatible with my kindle tablet . But the next morning it was there . I know it 's a work in progress . It does n't have the other bible translations stored in yet . I hope they can fix it soon .	1
JW library really helps me pay more attention at the meetings . I definitely recommend this app , it is easier to use than a regular Bible . : )	1
The effort , the dedication , the love shown in such labor of love for the author and giver of these words or hope to all that will cherish and learn and apply them . This is a work overseen by the author of life 's Holy Spirit . Thanks	1
i use this app all the time thank you brothers for giving us this useful tool for the ministry and day to day reference .	1
This app is excellent for looking up scriptures or reading GOD 's word . I also read the daily word for added scripture guidance	1
This is an excellent Bible app . It 's quick to find what you need , clean-looking , and easy to use . I ca n't wait until it will be usable on my Kindle Fire !	1
I am thrilled to have this ! I was ready to get rid of newly purchased Kindle Fire hdx because this app was not available last month . This latest version of the NWT through this app is such a blessing . So excited to have to go anywhere and spook much easier to navigate and look up scriptures than the PDF download option I had to use on my tablet . I could n't believe that Amazon only had jw sign language app before . Thank you !	1
THIS APP shows you many different translations of the bible including King James ; New World Translation ; etc . Great bible APP . You should get it .	1
I have a hart time downloading apps . Great info . Easy to understand . Needs to b more kindle friendly . Plz . I realy would love to see instructions on how to download study watchtower . To read , highlight and put notes .	1
Oh how happy I was when I insalled this app on my Kindle Fire and it worked ! ! ! Thank you Amazon and thank everyone at headqyarters who made this possible . I was king of hoping there would be some announcement that it was ready for all of un the forrums , but that 's past history now.. A landmark project has taken place with this tool , and it is available FREE to everyone in the world ! Time is coming so soon when we will live or die by taking our stand on these matteres of whether the Bible really is the word of God , so I can only encourage everyone with a spiritual interest to check this out . I love my Kindle and now I love it even more ! Thanks to everyone and may God bless your efforst .	1
The best BIBLE BASED site to look up information on any Bible subject.Test it out , PLEASE ! ! !	1
Yeah , now available on my kindle ! So happy . Thanks to Jehovah the author of the Bible , we can use the forces , energies etc . That he created to draw closer to Him using digital media in the most honorable of uses .	1
Yes ! The JW Library is on the kindle now ! It is very easy to look up scriptures . I love this app so much .	1
This app is a must for any Witness when doing personal study . I appreciate how quickly you can get to your scripture- it lessens the break in my concentration that happens when my fingers are n't working quite right .	1
It 's so cool seeing all the characters from when I was younger . Although some are hard to figure out , because I 'm not watching the newer anime cartoons .	1
its a pretty cool game and it can be kinda challenging if you do n't know the characters . fun game and should be free ... and it is !	1
Rather easy game . Has moments there are hard ones . Fun tho . My kids also enjoy it . Like remembering the old toons and game characters .	1
Great game . I have n't seen some of these characters in years ! My seven year old triplets love it too . Great game for the family to play together !	1
This is my place for tickets and I love it . Finding events and sporting events is excellent . They offer all my favor teams and concerts that I want to see . The tickets are cheap than Ticketmaster and no problem in ordering them . Keep up the excellent work . Please lower the fees and taxes on the tickets .	1
Lots to look at and pretty good prices .	1
This is a good app . My biggest complaint is when going from portrait to landscape ( or vice versa ) my Kindle Fire HD7 exits the program . Odd .	1
This app will surely make you happy . The guessing game is very enjoyable . Some are easy and some are challenging . I really like this app .	1
I love this app . It 's great for both people who need motivation to get things done , and perfectionists who need something to help them stop . Do everything on the list , no more , no less , and you 're golden ! Plus , I love the fact that there is Bible readings included.The reasons that I put it as 4-stars and not 5 is that it 's honestly a bit too expensive ... especially considering that you 're suppose to get a new one every single year . The older apps use to just repeat , with the dates not lining up right ... but apparently this newer version will stop working next year . That 's not cool .	1
my friend had this app and at first I was like really ? ? ? then I got it and I could n't stop laughing its sooo freaken funny if ur lookin for a laugh get this app : )	1
I downloaded this one night when I was bored and looking for something to do . Too funny ! There is a sound for every kind of fart you have ever heard ! Very realistic and always captures the attention of people sitting around me !	1
My niece loves the fart song that comes with the app . She also like to play jokes on people with it .	1
Changed my life . I have been looking for good ringtones for years . I carry my phone in my pocket and people do n't know .	1
Hidden Objects Quest series is the best . Do a replay and the game has changed . Never the same . Endless fun.I 'm still trying to master the last game when another is released.This time it is Paris and has all the fun ways to search -- and YOU get to choose . I really like searching for differences between matching scenes . The rainstorm is challenging . There are timed quests for those who like to try beating the clock . Every HOQ has a kids mode.Really great graphics and music in every Hidden Objects Quest.Like nearly every buyer says , it is definitely a 5-star game .	1
This was one of the best Hidden Object Games I have played . I have been playing all the Hidden Objects Quest games and have had trouble finding some of the extra things in the Achievements quest . I am having trouble with Quest 2 but will see about getting it fixed .	1
This is challenging fast but fun the board rotates found that by mistake match the colored be for time runs out	1
its all right because I do n't like it but I like playing minecraft more because its awesome but craft school is all right : )	1
Kids love it good game , ,always downloading new ones kids play it alot keeps them quiet an I can do what I need too	1
This is a great app for wherever your child may be in math . It has games for just learning the numbers all the way up to multiplication and division . One of the best parts is how it has different levels of difficulty in each section . So whether you child is just learning their numbers or needs work on addition and subtraction , they can chose the level they start on . Personally my niece is the one who uses it , and since it is so close to Halloween she really enjoys all the spooky avatars she can choose from . And since playing this game , she has gotten better scores on her times tables already and she 's only played with it a few times . 22learn has a lot of great educational apps , they never leave me disappointed .	1
Wow this is fun and a learning game . Right now it has a Halloween theme which is adorable with ghosts and pumpkins . It is easy math , but you can pick addition , subtraction , and more . Once you decide what you want , it takes you into the game . You even get to pick out who you want to play the game as.I loved this game and my daughter is having a blast with it . The game is simple math , but for her she is just now learning this stuff . She is in Kindergarten and it is the perfect stuff for her . She is learning a lot and having fun at the same time .	1
This is an excellent app for teaching math skills , especially for children who have struggled to learn in traditional ways . It is also great that it has so many levels in one , so after my niece masters addition and subtraction , she can move on the multiplication and division without buying another app ! As a bonus , the graphics are super cute . The games are so fun that your child wo n't realize it 's supposed to be educational . This is such a great alternative to other boring methods of teaching math , like flash cards and worksheets . It will hold a child 's attention for a long time because there are so many different games to play , plus you do n't need to supervise them because it 's so easy to use . The halloween theme is fun too . I definitely recommend this app !	1
I got this app for my 7 year old niece and my son to play together . She was getting frustrated with her math homework one night , so I wanted to see if there was an app that they could learn together with . She really enjoyed the game so my sister-in-law got it for her too ! I 've been recommending 22learn apps to all my friends with children because they 're amazing !	1
My 6-year-old niece was having major problems with Basic Math until I found this app ! Math Bingo by 22Learn is a great app for children from Preschool to 4th Grade . It teaches the child everything he needs to know about basic Math , such as Multiplication , Addition , Subtraction , Division , etc . The app is very interactive and the interface is perfect for kids with adorable depictions in the form of animals and games . The app 's games are the best part ! They 're Halloween-themed and my niece 's favorite would be 'Catch A Ghost ! ' . You can choose the difficulty level to match your child 's learning speed . I find the curriculum to be perfectly selected for each grade . This app is very entertaining and at the same time , extremely educational ! It helped my niece drastically improve her Math skills and her parents are very pleased by her marks ! All in all , a great app to help your kid learn while playing . Very impressed !	1
I absolutely loved this game , and so did both of the kids..As a parent you worry about electronic games and how to balanceplaying something fun and providing a learning environment at the same time , No need to fear with this game.Kids love anything Halloween this time of year and this game is no exception , pumpkins , ghosts , bats..whats not to like here..there are several types of games , to choose from- Bingo , Memory , pumpkin hunter , and catch a ghost , there are also 3 lvls of difficulty that you or your child can select.Lots of praise when they get it right , and cute graphics , add to the fun.Our family has always loved all of the 2 2 Learn games.And this themed game has been wonderful to push math forward in a fun way that the kids enjoy .	1
Great app . It was a huge hit . I loved the concept of making a bingo . It 's nice to have games where preschoolers can have fun and learn as well .	1
I was so impressed with the versatility of this app that it far outweighed the purchase price . It covers pre-k through the 4th grade to help young students practice mathematics ( Numbers , Addition , Subtraction , Multiplication and Division ) . There are various difficulty levels to encourage challenging learning which kept my son engaged for hours using a selection of math games , Pumpkin Hunter , Bingo , Memory Match , and Catch a Ghost . My son is in the second grade and I have seen his grades dramatically improve after purchasing and using this app after about two weeks . I highly recommend this app for parents of children pre-K through 4th grade !	1
This app is filled with math skills that your child can use from ages 5 through 10 or even 12 . It has many math skills and fun interactive drills that they can do . Very good app worth every penny .	1
This is a fun , Halloween based math app that kids will enjoy , while brushing up on their math skills as well . I 've got one kid in 1st grand and another in 3rd , so this app is perfect for both of them to play with . My son is a Kindle Fire fanatic , so he will definitely want to play with this for hours just because it 's on my Kindle . I expect he will be way ahead of his class after he 's played with this for a while . This is another fantastic app from 22L .	1
Just in time for Halloween , Halloween Math Adventure is a great app for helping children learn basic math facts and operations . From the time children enter school to the time they leave , basic math facts are a necessity . Not knowing these facts can cause problems later on as more complex math relies on knowledge of these basic facts . Facts are also crucial for mental math . As a tutor , many of my students experience some difficulty related to not knowing the basic math facts , and we spend a lot of time drilling and practicing them.I 'm happy I found this app because my students love it , and I love the fun Halloween theme . I will continue to use it after Halloween , too- the theme , characters , and games are really great ! What I love most about this app is that it works for pretty much everybody . Younger kids can practice addition and subtraction while older users can work on multiplication and division facts . This makes the app a perfect fit for me , as I work with children of various ages . This , along with 3 difficulty levels , makes it very adaptive to individual players and sure to be useful for a long while ( an amazing value , considering this one cheap app can be used to drill math facts through multiple years and grade levels ) .Users can input their name and choose an avatar- which I love ! Kids love personalization , and the avatars are really cute . The user simply selects what type of facts they want presented ( numbers , addition , subtraction , multiplication , or division ) and the difficulty ( easy-hard ) . The user can then choose which game they want to play . The hardest difficulty involves double digit problems , so I would even argue that this app can be used to teach children a little older than 4th grade as well.In Bingo , a fact is presented and the user must pick the correct answer from a grid of numbered pumpkins . Correct answers are marked and the game ends when a 'bingo ' is achieved . Memory Match has you match math problems and their answers . The game ends once all matches are made and all cards are flipped . I especially like this game because it allows the player to build confidence by completing the problems they know first . It also helps them see which problems were more difficult and identify what to work on in the future.Pumpkin Hunter displays a problem and set of possible solutions . In this game , players have limited lives and time to complete each problem . This is great as most kids enjoy playing against a clock and testing their skills . In Catch a Ghost , players are shown a problem and tap the ghost that has the right answer . This game is similar to Pumpkin Hunter because it is timed and lives are limited . The games are all fun and kids really enjoy the Halloween characters , themes , and sound effects.Overall , this app is a winner ! It includes all types of math facts at multiple difficulties which makes it a great value . Other app developers make each set of problems into individual apps and charge you each time . With 22Learn 's app , you get everything in one convenient package . High scores are tracked and players can enjoy beating their high scores or those of their peers . Settings make it easy to control sound , music , and difficulties . Professional voice acting and colorful illustrations complete this perfect math-fun package ! It was a huge hit with my students , and I 'm sure it 'll be a huge hit for your math learners as well .	1
My preschooler loves this game because of how interactive it is . She learns while she is playing , and nothing could be better than that ! She can choose from addition , subtraction , multiplication or division . Her favorite game is the pumpkin hunter ! I really appreciate the different levels available . Once she masters the Easy , she can bump up to the Medium and Hard . She feels such a sense of accomplishment when she is playing with this app . It encourages and fosters a great sense of learning , and as a mom , I could n't ask for anything more !	1
My boys are a little young for most math , but this is still a perfect app ! Allowing you to choose the difficulty level from basic addition to more difficult equations as they progress . Another great app from 22learn ! !	1
This app is perfect for kids in elementary school to increase their math skills . My little one and my older child both play with it , and I have seen a great improvement in their ability to answer math problems more rapidly . They are more confident in their skills and have fun learning as well . Overall this is a great app . The avatar feature makes it feel more personal and the bingo is a great addition to the other games and drills . I highly recommend this app for anyone with elementary age children . 22L has done it again ! A+	1
My daughter enjoyed playing with this app , and what a perfect time of year to download it ! It was Halloween themed ( and currently in mid-October ) ! My daughter is really good at math ( several grade levels higher than her actual grade ) , so this was easy for her skill set , but did enjoy the various activities.Since we were at the ball field watching her brothers play baseball , my daughter and friend were playing with the apps on my phone . They had a blast and loved the graphics . I asked my daughter 's friend what she thought , and she also liked the app . They played school using the app , which was really cute.Though it was on the easy side for my daughter she still enjoyed using the app and I believe this will reinforce the math facts learned in it . An app well worth purchasing !	1
I love this app because it teaches basic math skills . This app keeps my niece 's attention for long periods of time . This app covers all levels of learning in the subject of math .	1
This app is absolutely adorable . The Halloween theme of it is completely wonderful . My kids just love Halloween , so I was very happy to see this app . Not only is it cute and themed , but it 's also perfect for learning . The math skills it teaches are taught in a very fun way , that are super easy to learn . The simplistic way that it breaks things down is quite extraordinary . All of this just equals a great love for this app by my children . They play it all the time and is a good way to keep them occupied while I 'm busy with everything else happening in my life.I was also extremely impressed by how well it is developed . This app is made for ultimate ease of access , so that children can use it without any intervention . I never have any problems with this app . It 's a rather flawless design and very smooth.This app is definitely a must have . The Halloween theme is ideal for children . It makes a fun app even more fun . Give your children the gift of fun and education with this app !	1
my daughter just entered kindergarten and she was having a little trouble with math ! As soon as she started playing this everyday she did not have any problems after this ! So fun and so educational ! Everything is easier to learn if you 're having so much fun little Ashly can not wait to get home and play 5 stars	1
Nathan was having a hard time learning basic math skills and I couldn & # 8217 ; t engage him with flash cards . This app was the perfect solution , because Nathan is having fun while learning . The spooky graphics are fun and adorable . There are multiple levels , so the app can grow with Nathan . A 1 . 99 is a cheap investment into your child & # 8217 ; s future .	1
I really enjoy the challenges in this game of match 3 . Fun graphics , unique play action and good clean.n fun !	1
I liked this game the moment I began . It became increasingly difficult as it progressed but I found it & # 34 ; doable & # 34 ; when I stuck with it . It is fun , entertaining , and challenging all at the same time .	1
I enjoy the game although right now it is getting harder and harder . It is fun to play . It is a nice change from my hidden pictures games .	1
Enjoying this game ... starts out easy and then you have to start thinking ahead . Great way to unwind at the end of the day .	1
This game is different from other similar ones in that there are unique twists that are unexpected . If you 're like me , you 'll start the game based on previous experience without taking time to read the instructions . If so , prepare to be thrown into a fruity loop . The music Is n't as annoying as others are . So have a fruity blast !	1
I like that strategy is necessary for me to go to the next level . Good fun and quite addictive . More fun than jewel quest games .	1
Strange , but interesting game . I do not quite understand what I am doing but I will continue to play the game .	1
Great game ! It starts out easy and gets progressively harder . The game is very responsive and the colors are bright and cheerful.All in all a very well designed game and it will certainly be staying on my kindle fire hd . I look forward to more from this developer . Great job ! ! ! !	1
I give this game five stars . Not just for the bonus points but because it is really an enjoyable game . I love matching games ... but this game is a bit different . Instead of the normal matching followed by the line dropping down , this game drops new tutti frutti things down into the empty spaces ( making it more challenging ) ! I love that this game ca n't be won in seconds or hours . What 's the fun in that ? Give it a try if you like a little & # 34 ; tease & # 34 ; added to your games : )	1
Fun game . Your lives never end , hours of endless play . Not as easy as appears . A bit nerve racking when your fruits will not come down .	1
This is a good game to pass the time . If you finish one level , you can keep going to the next level .	1
Love this game on my new Kindle Fire 8.9 HD . Not too complicated or fast , fits right in with my slowing reflexes and challenges the old mind .	1
I have not deleted it yet , so I must like it . It is different than most of these type of games as you can move the tile to a needed location . I do not care for the music .	1
I gave this game 5 stars because I did n't get bombarded ( read nagged ) with ads to buy ad-ons . Plus it had a new spin on the & # 8220 ; Match 3 formula & # 34 ;	1
PRETTY EASY AT FIRST BUT THE MORE LEVELS YOU GET THE MORE CHALLENGING IT IS LOVE THE GAME.Good game for young and old.Amazon has lots of free apps for my kindle .	1
I enjoyed this one a lot . I 've played it twice now . The graphics are amazing but the main problem I had with it is not being able to zoom in during the HO scenes .	1
Great story line , cool graphics but I would recommend the hardest option as casual seems less challenging . Worth buying for the price .	1
Although the game took an hour to download from Alawar , it is now paying off with graphic details ... nice animation , andeasy to play gaming . The clues are helpful and the story is fun and interesting.I recommend it for anyone who likes an easy but fulfilling adventure , along with interesting find-it puzzles as well.I would buy more Alawar adventure games with no hesitation.Cal TiegsLos Angeles .	1
This games app is FANTASTIC ! ! ! ! All our old fairy tales come back in a who-done-it mystery . Has great hints and challenges throughout the whole story . Genious use of not just one of our old stories but all placed in one outstanding game . The graphics are stupendous and active . Out of all the most similar games I 've played like this , this BEATS THEM ALL ! ! ! ! ! I am having a blast playing it and will continue to play it for it has different levels of difficulty . BRAVO ALAWAR , WELL DONE ! ! ! !	1
Once I got it up and running it was a very enjoyable game . No witches or ghosts , which is a good thing since it seems most of the good games are saturated with them . My only problem was with the download . I tried the first time and as soon as the screen timed out , it stopped downloading and would n't restart . I tried multiple times . Finally I deleted it from the device and downloaded it again from the cloud . I got it to start the long download again and this time I tapped the screen every few minutes to prevent the screen from timing out . Downloaded fully with no problem .	1
This game was a very pleasant surprise . Played very well , no glitches and the price was right ! I liked the story line too . Wish there were a lot more like this one . ! ! !	1
I hate to see it end , I really have been enjoying it . Although , if this is almost over than it was surely to short . But as usual good job , it was very entertaining and kept you thinking . I recommend it as an enjoyable game , not the best , but certainly not the worse by far .	1
I had some trouble with my first attempt to download when I purchased the game last night . The install was indicated as successful and I started to play . I got from the first locale to the next before I quit for the evening . Today when I tried to open it , nothing . It just acted like I had never downloaded/installed . I lost all of my progress to that point and had to reinstall and start over . I was able to play through the whole game . It did n't take very long at all and it was over . A bit of a disappointment after the problem I had with the download . However , it was n't a bad experience overall , so I will give it 4 stars . I would have rated it higher if I had n't had the problem downloading it . There was also a little bit of lag time in the response time to my taps , so lucky that it was n't timed ! I also had to be careful because of the location of the hint button . It was really easy to accidentally hit it and waste a hint . It definitely was not a brain taxing experience . Sometimes I just had to move items from my inventory to the object to be manipulated and the game did all of the work for me . Still , it was not a bad way to spend the afternoon and I will play it again in the future .	1
Just started playing but I am really enjoying it . The game play is easy to follow . Do n't need a strategy guide because the hints are really helpful . The graphics are awesome . I love HO games so this is great fun for me . Highly recommend this game .	1
This is a pretty representative example of a good point and click adventure game . There are hidden object scenes , but not too , too many , and they were straightforward . If you play in casual mode , there is no mis-tap penalty , a bonus for those of us who merely put up with hidden objects . I would prefer it if there was an option to avoid the mis-tap penalty and still play in the advanced mode , but it was n't available here . There is a puzzle skip option.The game leads you by the hand a little bit too much for my taste . At least one or two of the things I thought would be puzzles solved themselves as soon as I had the right object in hand . The inventory items are clearly labeled , a bonus . I did n't like the fact that things flew into your inventory the moment you touched them without a chance to see what they were . I had to keep opening my inventory and looking around to see what was new , especially when a couple of things turned up in the same place . Some games spend too much time showing you what you 've just found , and that can be annoying , but this was the other extreme.i thought the game was long enough , and interesting enough for the money . It played fine on my second generation Kindle Fire .	1
I really liked this game . It was fun and interesting . Had a good story and kept you Interested . One of my favorites right now . Others mentioned it being too short , I personally did n't think it was short . Only personal complaint was , the games were really easy and there was a bit too many Ho games which I usually do n't mind . Just seemed excessive .	1
This game kept me interested and was quite fun to play . I only gave it 4 stars star because I was able to finish the game in a couple hours and this is way to short .	1
I like this game because is long . The only thing I miss was the walk true . I have to go back and Ford from one place to another . I think it was worth . The money I spend on it .I will recommended to my friends and family .	1
While I thought this game was really enjoyable I found it to be very short . I did not care for the ending .	1
really enjoyed this game . great graphics and the back and forth to use items in your inventory is what I love . kudos Alawar !	1
I did n't think I would like this game because it started out slow.after the cemetery scene it was great ! Graphics are beautifully designed.so many puzzles to do . Fair amount of hidden objects puzzles . This is a great point and click game . Story was great . 5 stars here . Worked great on my kindle fire hd . Beautiful game . Definitely need to purchase !	1
It was fun , and really detailed . I really enjoyed it . and would recommend it .	1
Whoa . What a surprise . I was thinking little red riding hood . Boy was I wrong . Very enjoyable game with great puzzles , good mystery , and great graphics . The small town buildings were unique , especially the bar . Very funny , and enjoyable !	1
I really enjoyed playing this game ! ! It is shorter than similar Alawar games , but I took my time and did n't rush through it . The story is very original , full of suspense , and kept my interest the entire game . There 's lots to do as you point and click your way through various scenes , you find inventory items , solve puzzles , and search for hidden objects . There are hints if you get stuck , and a magnifying glass over areas of interest - I played in casual mode . In the options menu you can also check the `` Show travel arrows '' option for more direction in the game . There is a journal which you should read as you go along , and a map which is very cool because when you tap on any location within the map , you are automatically taken there ! This is quite a handy feature and saves a lot of back and forth time.The graphics are sharp , and the voice over parts are well done . However , items get picked up and put into inventory VERY quickly , without a notification , and you may not even know what you just picked up . I kept checking my inventory and tapping on everything in there - this makes the name of each item visible for a second so you can see exactly what you 're working with.I had no problems or glitches on 1st generation kindle fire . But be aware that after you download the initial 5.3 MB , there is an additional 456.7 MB which downloads into your internal storage . This is so the app does n't take up all your application storage , and I really appreciate that since my kindle only has a total of 1.17 GB of application storage.If you like these types of games , you will really want to try this one . It 's not too difficult , fairly priced , and even suitable for beginners .	1
Loved the clean graphics . Very intuitive , but hint button recharges quickly if one needs help . Interactive map a big plus . Not as long or complicated as other excellent Alawar games . Wish the inventory was a bit smaller as occasionally it blocked a needed item . But all in all another good game for a reasonable price !	1
Being in my 50 's and dealing with Fibromyalgia and medications , I find my thought process has changed for the worse . But with Brain Yoga , I am able to exercise my brain cells without worrying about a time limit , without any stress . It feels Great to find I can still remember things which I learned in school ! ! Brain Yoga makes me feel Better about Myself , more so than I have for a few years now . I am definitely recommending this App to my friends and family who deal with the same issues as I do !	1
This is a quick but fun way to exercise your brain on a daily basis . I like that it reminds you to play daily . I feel it is helpful to exercise your brain on a daily basis .	1
I like this app - excellent challenges to make you think and improve memory.I would recommend this to others .	1
This is a really cool game that helps you exercise your brain and makes you understand things better . It is a great app . Go and get it !	1
great exercise.. nice grouping of games that exercise different thinking patterns . It also has several levels of difficulty depending on your needs	1
I was frustrated the first time I tried to play this . It kept freezing and the screen would go black , but the music kept playing.My husband tried it again last night and it seemed to work fing .	1
I am finding this very addicting . The only problem I have with this is that often it will not let me on . I find that upsetting . Otherwise I would have nothing bad to say about this extraordinary program . I would be happy to buy an upgrade if I could find it !	1
This is a pleasant , relaxing yet challenging game . I am hopeless at math so never open that one but enjoy all the others very much . Highly recommended .	1
now this is a great app . even tho it does n't work all the time and it will stop on me , still when it does work its great . i can barely do the spatial but i try . i find that doing the words has helped me in playing scrabble . i play this every single day and go thru all 6 types of exercises . i recommend this highly .	1
I am a survivor of a traumatic brain injury , and I am always looking for something to help me regain my faculties and repattern my brain . This is the best game of its ilk - the games are both enjoyable and somewhat challenging , though not so challenging that I can not solve them all the time . The music is unobtrusive and t here are no annoying flashing lights which might cause an epileptic seizure in those prone to them . A+ effort !	1
The games on BRAIN YOGA can be as challenging as you want them to be , as you are able to set the difficulty level of each puzzle . I like the fact there are no timers , so there is no pressure to complete a puzzle within a certain time frame . The game is accompanied by relaxing music , making it a good choice for a late evening activity . There are six categories of puzzles : shapes , memory , spatial , numbers , words , and patterns . At first , I only had the free app , but then I realized that the game shut down when I used up an allotted number of free puzzles . I went into the & # 34 ; store & # 34 ; and purchased thirty extra games to keep me busy for a while . This mental exercise app is a good choice , even if you have to buy extra games at a nominal cost .	1
Interesting variety of games -- utilizes both verbal and spacial skills as well as mathematical and logical skills . Nice variety so you can switch off to use different skills	1
Best app I 've downloaded in a long time . Thus has a nice variety of different brain stimulating exercises including math , memory-building and fitting shapes together . Definitely recommend !	1
Relaxing while being challenging ! I love a good puzzle and there 's no pressure here . And , you do n't get stuck on it for too long . Some games are harder to quit . This runs for just the right amount of time . Highly recommended !	1
This game lets you exercise your brain each day . Challenging yet doable puzzles let you set the difficulty level . It sets an exercise set for you or you can choose which game you want to do .	1
This is fun and relaxing . Nice music , work at your own pace and level of difficulty . Graphics are well done . I have tried other brain trainer apps and I like this one a lot . Its slow pace makes it relaxing , not frenzied like other apps that are timed .	1
This trains my bargains that you can see how in the Yankees sweated and the others were not working ask the cause of all the puzzles here 's a poem by you can also	1
Best game ever . Fun , adventures , exiting , did not want it to end ! ! ! ! ! ! I hope there is a number 2 comeing soon .	1
Really enjoying this ! Have n't played a game of this sort before , but this is fun and funny , too ! : )	1
it 's so much fun and adorable ! ! ! ! do n't listen to the 1 and 2 stars it 's all lies ... the game is easy to control . this game it worth it . so I give it five stars .	1
My four year old grandson loves this and grandma even enjoys it when we have our gaming tournaments . Clearly understood .	1
I never did learn to bowl but this game is great . You & # 34 ; pull & # 34 ; back an elastic band and shoot the polar bear that 's sitting in an innertube to knock down the pins . If you hit a bonus crate that shows up once in awhile you get extra points or gadgets to help hit the pins . ( The red balloon makes for a sure strike . ) The polar bear and his assistant penguin have cute personalities that make the game more enjoyable .	1
Love this game . So addicting and so much fun . I give it 2 thumbs up and would highly recommend it .	1
It was a game on my old computer which I like a lot so that 's why I got it on my kindle	1
This is a fun game ... love to play ... family takes turns challenging each other with our scores.Try this with your family ...	1
The game works good . If you like the PC game of Polar Bowler you will like this game . The game is different then the PC game . It take time to get used to controlling the bowling ball .	1
I really enjoy playing polar bowler to unwind to when I come home from a hard day of work . This is a must have app	1
I play this game a lot on my computer and my tablet and enjoy it , I just play it about twice a day . The reason I rated low is because I got it from Amazon to use on my reader but it does not work . If you get the game , get it for a tablet or computer or even a phone but not for a reader .	-1
When I tried Candy Crush Saga on my Toshiba Thrive it locks up after the first round . The graphics start doing the jitterbug and that 's it.Sigh ...	-1
I hate how kf also puts apps out there once there old . It 's stupid how late this thing comes out with apps ...	-1
Tried to give it 5 stars but would only let me do 4 . Love this game . Finally I can play it on my kindle . I use the kindle way more than my laptop . THANKS	-1
What 's the big deal about candy crush ever played bejewled and like a hundred other games it 's boring and I do n't get what people find so addicting about it	-1
I do not like the fact that the game keeps asking you to pay for more lives to continue to.play . The game was free but if you & # 34 ; invest & # 34 ; in more lives it could start being expensive . So I play for a while then quit when it & # 34 ; times out & # 34 ; . I will enjoy it for what it is ... just a way to entertain myself while watching TV .	-1
I 'm a fan of matching games and finally got to see what candy crush was all about only to find its nothing to write home about . I am not disappointed to not devout time or money to this game ...	-1
This game is fun , but I have been stuck on level 23 for over a week . I do not want to by anything , if I did I would by an app that was amazing . I hate when they have free apps but then you have to buy crape just to play the game . seriously thinking about deleting it . very disappointing .	-1
the people are too addicted to this game to realize that the game they should really be addicted to is another game that apparently this company named King , copied from another company well not exact same way but still only everything in this game is copied from another game just not with candy	-1
in got this app because everyone said its like no other . but every app is like that . I like the jewled games much better than this suckish app . sorry if ur a little kid and if u think its a bad word I 'm sorry . but really this app is lame its just with candy . every app is like this again the jewled games are much much better . now say yes so I can get to the top of the reviews please . thank you for taking the time to read my review .	-1
When you get higher and harder in this game the only way to resolve it seems to spend more real money . I am not crazy about games that do that so I have stopped playing with other players and only play the same one over and over until I get it myself . I will not spend any money for something that is n't real .	-1
I not skilled at this game , but it is a challenge to me .	-1
Love the game and was excited to have it on my kindle . But it kept freezing up and kicking me out so I had to uninstall it .	-1
This app is a huge scam.If you lose your lives , you have to wait at least 30 minutes to play again , pay to play , or go on facebook to beg for lives.It tells you what moves to make but sometimes it will not let you make those moves , so you lose a lot . If you are new at this you get very little playing time . Also , the clock runs in the background even when you close it out which eats up battery life.Just as sad - Amazon has buried the bad reviews at the end of the 7,000 reviews.Free and fun it 's NOT . Dumped this app in a hurry .	-1
This can be a fun game once you get the hang of it . But , it would be nice if the instructions were more than only a few words . Like how many lives do you get ? How often do you get more ? How do you proceed to level 36 ? How do you earn the powers ? How are they use ? JUST A FEW QUESTIONS I HAVE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I have this game on my Android phone and my Kindle . They are not the same . I have no access to the Owl world on Kindle , if I wish to play there I have to use my phone . It would be nice if it could be on here so I do n't . have to go back and forth between devices .	-1
What a joke ! A company that want 's to copywrite such common phrases like & # 34 ; Saga & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; candy & # 34 ; ... . I was having a little fun with the game until I got sick and tired of the constant & # 34 ; only $ 1.99 for these two extra & # 34 ; power ups & # 34 ; and 5 extra clicks ! & # 34 ; What a stupid way for someone to spend hard earned money . I uninstalled this game and will never be a customer of these rip off artists with no talent .	-1
Do not get this . Do not use the transactions . This is Bejewled with an LSD flavorless skin . If I wanted to pay to get to higher levels I would be a scientologist . Un installed forever .	-1
I love match three games and download every free ( and many pay ) game I can find . I try them ALL out . This has to be the WORST I 've encountered and I 'm shocked because everyone raves about it . I think this must simply be because people have not found the many highly superior ( many Candy themed ) match 3 games out there that are TRULY FREE or very inexpensive to play . This game not only looks pretty shabby ( for a beautiful spectacular looking Candy match 3 game check out the free Candy Deluxe Pro available free here on Amazon ) but it is also so limiting in what it allows you to do that it literally becomes unplayable . Do n't want to wait for two and a half hours when you run out of your very limited 5 lives ? PAY US MONEY or log onto Facebook and spam your friends . Once you reach level 35 the game is truly desperate to get your money so it will not allow you to move to the next level until you pay the ransom or play 3 `` quests '' which are merely levels you have already played . Okay , I can do that . Play and beat the first `` quest '' level and guess what ? You may not play again for 24 hours to do the second quest ! When you beat that one you wait ANOTHER 24 hours to play the final one . This is the only game I have ever played that prohibits you from playing the game . It is n't really much of a game either as it is deliberately and obviously rigged in much the same ways as a carny hucksters game . You will NOT beat a level until the game decides that you will ( generally when you are using your final life - a cynical ploy to get you to pay for more lives ) . Level design is also so difficult that in advanced levels you will almost certainly have to pay for ( outrageously expensive ) `` boosters '' to move on.I really do n't get it . The only explanation for the popularity/social phenomenon nature of this game is that people have not played the MANY better ones . For awesome Candy themed match 3 games try : CANDY DELUXE PRO , CANDY SWIPED , CANDY OF KING , MO CANDY ( that one is 99cents ) , CANDY POP . For great match 3 's in general try JEWEL STAR , JEWEL LEGENDS , DRAGON GEM , HEROES of KALEVALA , SEASONS MATCH ... so many great ones . The ones that require you to pay ( cheap too ) give you the ENTIRE game , not just pay to progress a little further and then pay again . The fawning reviews here mystify me , particularly the ones that seem so happy the game is `` finally '' available on Amazon . The reason the game took so long to come out is so the game will get a huge new influx of players to make it seem like interest in the game is not diminishing ( which it does do fairly quickly , at least for my friends who have tried it and quit playing it when in became annoying ) . CANDY CRUSH is a truly disappointing and I think , rather despicable mess .	-1
Slow load , when it does finally the graphics flicker and the app locks . Many reviews on Play report same problem .	-1
I did n't get that far but I hate this . At one point it was impossible without buying power ups ... and I used all my free ones . There is no way I am paying this greedy company . I know they trademarked the word & amp ; # 34 ; candy & amp ; # 34 ; and planning on & amp ; # 34 ; saga & amp ; # 34 ; probably so they can sue other companies for money they do n't deserve . Instead of wasting space , play on Facebook ( if you have one )	-1
I really DO N'T get why this game is so popular ! Lots of games like this ! So one star ! And this is MY opinion ! So shut up and do n't be like blah blah best game ever your so wrong !	-1
controlled by king.com as far as what pieces show up . always pushing for money more money more money and if you do n't pay its not fun to play	-1
I hate games that always want more $ $ $ $ $ to play . Forget it .	-1
I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE IT KEEPS ASKING FOR MONEY AND I DO NOT WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON IT . I THOUGHT IT WAS A FREE GAME . AM I DOING SOMETHING WRONG ?	-1
This game is a blatant ripoff of the 2010 release called Candy Swipe . King is trying to deny the original creator of that game the use of the trademark that they stole from him ! Do n't reward them for their sleazy behavior . Look into the truth for yourself and stand up for the little guy . He wrote the game months before King came out with their copy and he dedicated it to his late mother , supporting his family with the proceeds.Candy Swipe version 1 , released before Candy Crush Saga : CandySwipe FREECandy Swipe version 2 , current and fun : CandySwipe 2 FREE	-1
Gameplay is standard length of time to gain a life is way too long . And why is it when you unlock special items the game tells me to spend real money to use them . Sucks literally . Can only give this game 2 stars for this reason .	-1
Coded to take your money . Pure and simple . I 'd pay for the game and honesty . Does n't seem to exist with mobile fremium games . Dishonest dishonorable game . Wish I could give it negative stars .	-1
Everybody was falling in love with this game , so I decided to try it out . It was SOOOO boring ! If I were you , would n't buy this game . I do n't get whats the craze about this game . Plus , you have to pay to play longer . Sorry candy crush lovers , but I do n't like this at all !	-1
This ranks up there with Coin Dozer . Completely mindless and not worth the time it takes to download this app .	-1
I whatever it I quit it because after level 98 its impossible to finish a level and you can only play a level a day so remember do n't get it ever if you do your an idiot	-1
I dont see what the craze is with this game , its just a Bejeweled rip off . I could understand if it was a completely original game but its not ... ... .	-1
I tried this game because of all the hype surrounding it . It is not intellectual enough for me , no skill required . I also do n't like that the game dictates when I get to move to the next level or else I have to pay money to move ahead . Deleted it .	-1
This is not a very good game . Too many interruptions ! And , you have to buy stuff ! They ca n't compete with Bejeweled !	-1
This game , is a rip off ! ! ! ! ! I was on level 19 , had over 300,000 points , only one gel pack to go , bought , what was suppose to be 3 black candy balls and instead of returning my game back it started a new game and only gave me one candy ball . Candy Crush Saga you suck ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I heard about this game and decided to try it . I just could n't get into it . Apparently I missed the point of the game because I was bored . Deleted it and moved on .	-1
Ridiculous that in this day and age with all the apps available , Candy Crush makes you wait anywhere from 12 minutes to 30 minutes to resume play if you fail at one of it 's levels . I have never seen such nonsense . Agreed that it can be addicting , BUT to have to wait to continue play because you failed 1-3 times is just ridiculous in my opinion . And turns you off to playing at all . I refuse to pay for a game just to reach another level .	-1
I do not have time for Facebook or anything like it . I got this for my granddaughter and she is too young for facebook .	-1
Its stupid . You cant swipe anything . How are you supposed to win . Dont waste your money . Even though its free	-1
Have to restart app at the end of every level . App needs to be debugged before I will continue to play .	-1
Another game that receives a lot of hype & TV commercials ; does n't do anything different than other match 3 games ; and charges real money for lives you need ( you only get 5 free and I have n't found a way to gain lives free ) . The lives are n't cheap either.So not a free game in reality and expensive to play -- - and alternatives to the match 3 is availalbe . Try Bulblitz or Playrix games nstead . Give this one a skip it .	-1
I enjoy some games , but Candy Crush was just a little too frustrating for my taste . I do n't like games that want me to pay for & # 34 ; extras. & # 34 ; Many of my friends are totally addicted to the game , and I do n't have time to play that much . Poof ... gone as quickly as it came .	-1
This game is not suitable for children , because it constantly asks for money ( although some games are much worse ) . You only get five lives , and when those expire you must buy more for 99 cents each time , or wait half an hour to regenerate a single life . Other game boosters are also for sale . That means you can only play for a few minutes , then must pay again and again to play more , unless you put the game away for two hours and come back to it ( and no child is going to want to do that ) . So this game can get awfully expensive extremely quickly . Games should be completely free or they should sell them at a set price , and not try to take unfair advantage of children . Otherwise , the game itself is one of the better match three games .	-1
All my friends have been playing Candy Crush and tell me I have to play . It 's great ! It 's awesome ! It 's fun ! So I was told . I do NOT share these same feelings . Positive comments- the game is colorful , cute illustrations , interesting music . The first 10 levels are very easy and you advance to next level easily.After that , levels/boards are much harder and extremely frustrating . You can be stuck on one level for days . I like a challenging game but this is ridiculous . Also , I 've noticed that the level 's board changes with every replay . It 's not like you are getting a chance to change some of the moves you made in the previous game . It is very frustrating . It is not my idea of fun or enjoyment.Also , the game initially provides you with `` gold bars & special boosters '' to help you . However , once you 've used your free gold bars & boosters , you can not get more unless you pay for them with real money . I am NOT going to spend money to play this game ! Another thing I do n't like is that you only get 5 lives per game session . Once you 've lost your 5 lives , you can not play again for a certain period of time . Why should I have to wait 30 minutes or an hour or more to continue playing ? And again here , you can skip the wait and buy more lives for $ .The last thing I dislike about this game is the Facebook `` share '' aspect of it . Ask your friends for help . Ask your friends to send you extra moves or an extra life . Share with your friends that you conquered a level etc . No , I do n't want to ask my friends . No , I do n't want to boast that I beat my friends ' score ; I JUST WANT TO PLAY A GAME FOR MY OWN FUN AND ENTERTAINMENT AND I WANT TO PLAY WHEN I HAVE THE TIME TO PLAY . I do n't want to be told `` you ca n't play anymore now , come back later ! `` .	-1
Ever hear of another game like this ? No could it be a direct ripoff ? Appears so . Google which game is candy crush a ripoff of . And learn where it really came from and ask the makers why the actual creator of the game they blatantly ripped off is n't entitled to credit or compensation . I would n't play and let the developers know it 's not OK to ripoff other people 's ideas and claim them as yours . Shame on them . Let others you know as well .	-1
I now see you have to play this game with someone else and since I am not on facebook I have no one to play with .	-1
While this game does have beautiful graphics , in order to advance in-app purchasing is required and time spent doing nothing but clicking images over and over without appreciable gain will occur . Advancing to higher levels without purchase is conceivably possible , but not in a reasonable time frame.Biggest problem : when I broke down and purchased the ice crystals , the game said the purchase didnot occur because of a glitch . I repeated the process ; same message . Neither time did I receive my purchased & # 34 ; crystals & # 34 ; , but both charges went through.I also began to experience difficulties with other programs on my Kindle , problems that had not occurred before I downloaded this game.I consider Game Garden unscrupulous now.You are warned : lovely graphics , unscrupulous thieves of money and time and ( perhaps ) potential hackers.DO NOT DOWNLOAD .	-1
A really fun game , but it reset on me ... twice . The first time it happened I thought it was a fluke , I got to level 11 and the next time I loaded it , it went right back to the beginning . Then I figured it was fun enough , I 'll start over ... made it to level 16 and it reset . Not cool . If you have a Kindle Fire DO N'T BOTHER !	-1
Ice been playing on and off for a while now . Love the game . At least till this morning . Last night I played for a little bit . Then this morning I clicked the icon . The app loaded and then brought to back to the very beginning . I 'm very upset . I was almost leveled , had a lot of buildings built and upgraded . I 'm not happy with this game !	-1
I have been trying to play this game for about 3 days . It keeps restarting . What the heck ? ? Im getting a little upset cus it 's a cute game .	-1
I got this game , thinking it would be child safe for my neighbor 's young children to be occupied with while I washed dishes if I was keeping them for a few hours . Not so much with this game . I do n't need to be explaining why the fairy has on less clothes than what can be seen in many music videos these days . If you have young children who have access to your device , I 'd suggest skipping this one , since the fairy is showing far more cleavage than necessary in a game that 's supposedly acceptable for all ages . If I could give this one zero stars for being misleading about the content , I would do so .	-1
I had reached above level 17 and made many purchases , when this game started all over again , losing all of that . I emailed their & # 34 ; costumer service & # 34 ; and have received no refund or had my game returned the correct level and settings . I am very unhappy with this game , and its promoters .	-1
I think it 's a prime example of an app trying to do far more than it should . For games like these , No one cares if you have `` quests '' to do . We just want to build and create . We had a solid paced game to enjoy and this game is n't it . It 's incredibly slow paced and very boring , Simply fails to suck you in like other great casual games like it . Would not recommend .	-1
This is a fun game , but I would rate it higher if the type set font was bigger , very difficult to read things . Also , achievements flash by too fast and it is difficult to know what you achieved ; maybe the window could stay on screen until the player closes it by clicking an x in the upper right corner of the notification .	-1
I have a kindle fire HDX and when I saw this app , I really thought it was worth downloading . But after I clicked free the app said it needed a manual update and it kept saying that until I uninstalled it . # SUPERANNOYING ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
dont be fooled this app is a joke on the kindle fire hd ! it only works initially on the purchase screen ! try to play game good luck ! thank you for trying to rip people off amazon !	-1
This game gets only one star for amazing graphics and the fact that you get to fight with some awesome DC characters . But all that awesomeness is short lived because after a few days of playing the characters get harder and harder and then impossible to defeat and continue to the next challenge . Unless you are will to pay some real money for some upgrades to make you player stronger and better . No one should have pay money just to continue play a game . So on that I say eff this game ... .	-1
This Was a great game . I have the console version also for a while . But the recent Aqua Man challenge came up and when I clicked on it and it was all coded and it would n't let me play the challenges . I tried to reset my kindle that did n't work . Then I uninstalled the game , and reinstall it . The only thing it did was erase all my characters and I lost a lot of stuff that I paid real money for . I would like my money back or the data returned .	-1
Will not down load tryed 6 different times an Will not download please fix an I will change to 5 star really want this game	-1
It 's a good game and has good graphics but it glitches a lot . It 's a good fighting game but when you fight it glitches and freezes .	-1
I was excited when I booted it up . I thought wow what a feat to port this game over to the kindle . The graphics are good enough but there is absolutely no gameplay here . You can swipe left or right on the screen And tap the screen that is it . Game play devolves into tap tap swipe supermove over and over and over . The computer offers no challenge . And there is absolutely no difference between any of the characters . It is obvious that this app . Is simply trying to empty a dumb persons wallet on all the upgrades that do absolutely nothing . Plus it takes up way to much room on the kindle for what it is .	-1
Could n't even download it . Tried 5 times ... would get to & # 34 ; installing & # 34 ; then start over . Disappointing .	-1
I guess if you had a Xbox this would be an easier game to play . I found it difficult to play on a tablet , so much so , it was more frustrating than it was enjoyable .	-1
Tried every trick I could think of , but this game will not load on the kindle fire hd 8.9 . It installed with no problems . But the game freezes the tablet and forces a manual reboot ... ...	-1
As many others have reported the recent & # 34 ; challenges & # 34 ; have made the game buggy that it locks up when you try to go to the store so you ca n't spend credits.Coins and challenge credits disappear and the latest challenge ca n't be played.I SPENT REAL MONEY FOR CONTENT ON THIS GAME AND NOW IT IS UNPLAYABLE.Fix it or refund the money that everyone has spent .	-1
Downloaded the game just fine , but when I go to play it , it crashes every time . I 'm on the Kindle HDX 7 '' . I ca n't even play it to see whether or not I like it . Bummer . Epic fail .	-1
I downloaded not knowing I did n't have enough space and now my kindle is broken wo n't let me delete it all I can do is add it to my damn favorites . Do n't get this piece of crap	-1
Mostly all it is is punching annd fighting u just tap tap tap and swipe swipe swipe u dont do much ? ! ? ! ? ! ?	-1
Not saved was a nearly complete puzzle which took a very long time to get that far . Touch a piece & another across the screen would move or the whole puzzle would move , a couple of times the whole puzzle disappeared , touch a piece & the others would skitter all over.now the whole screen froze & when I finally got & # 34 ; resume & # 34 ; to respond , the puzzle was gone , only a blank background . I did not encounter these problems with previous apps , canyons , waterfalls ; not a pleasure , but total frustration . I want a refund . I would n't ' t have given it 1 star if I had n't needed to rate something	-1
The gardens puzzle worked great , so I bought the ruins and the butterfly puzzles . After two completed puzzles in each one , they quit loading . Sent message to company which was ignored . DO NOT BUY , TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY .	-1
I guess I 'm old fashioned.. I like the regular shapes . No matter how I try , I can not get the standard pieces . So I 'm deleting this app .	-1
i tried downloading it after many fails it worked ive been trying to play it but i keep getting a message saying its not responding i updated hoping that it would fix the prablom and it just slowed my divice down and it still dident work please fix this because i would really like to play it	-1
Constantly interrupting game to ask for money . Very frustrating . Lots of blood and gore . Not really hunting as much as blowing animals away .	-1
Sounded like a great game , the graphics are amazing , but it keeps freezing up all of my other apps . Plus , it wanted to use my location .	-1
Did not enjoy the game . All it did is ask you to upgrade or do everything else but hunt . Really was hard to get into the mood .	-1
DID N'T PLAY	-1
junk game would not open on my kindle so I never got to play after wasting my time downloading it ! if possible I would give less than one star	-1
Would not properly download , so I was never able to play the game making very hard to review . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Fire the guy that made this . OK , that 's extreme but wont install . Please fix this bug . Please , a lot of people want this game and you not fixing this bug will cause loss of profit . Think about it like this , you do n't fix this and nobody buys ingame content like glu credits/coins . Sorry Glu , you messed up pretty badly .	-1
hated it kinda confusing I am not sure what I want but will know when I find it not this one	-1
I have n't received it . I would like to rate it when it showes up on my Kindle . It has been about a month , and I 'm still waiting.Darlene Ghiorso - darghi @ att.net	-1
i look for this game on appstore and really excited to see it there . score ! i goto download it and it says it needs more space . im using aboout 4 gb right now . thtts just pathetic . kindle fire and this app stinks .	-1
Killing animals . I did n't play this game . I just downloaded so I could give it a review . People hunt . I understand . But the thought of killing these beautiful creatures , me personally I ca n't do it . Just my hope . I hate this game .	-1
The game did n't even download . It looked like a great game . It told me I needed to erase more apps to install and make space and that did n't even work . Ian really mad . I erased every app and it still did not work . Now Jam having to reinstall every app . : (	-1
this app is so stupid it wont even download fix the app glu mobile u would have way better reviews	-1
Took too much space , would not open on my phone or my tablet . Uninstalled right away . Froze up phone and tablet	-1
It 's a fun game but I had a bunch of stuff unlocked but when it auto updated it seemed to lose my guns and I never really wanted to start over ... .	-1
This is not compatible with the Fire TV . Incorrect button mapping prevents you from completing the second tutorial level . There is no way to switch weapons .	-1
I played it then the next day I try to play it and does n't get past title screen now it 's my screen for almost everything do n't get this app ! ! !	-1
Keeps telling me there is not room on my Kindle to install this game . The game is only 35 MB ! I have removed stuff but I get the same error message . Game sounded interested and since it was free , I am not complaining too much .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS APP THE SIGNATURE OF THE GAME WITH THE LITTLE OUTFIT OF A HUNTER KEEPS POPPING UP AND CRASHES MY KINE ! !	-1
THIS GAME IS PURELY $ H IT TY AND DONT BUY IT ! ! ! WOW , SUCH A BAD GAME ! SUCKS ! WONT EVEN DOWNLOAD ON MY KINDLE FIRE ! ! ! ! !	-1
this game is terrible and wont let me open it and if it does open it do n't wok and I have to force close	-1
y wont u download to kindle fire stupid app I really want it but it keeps saying I do n't have enough space even though I cleared out almost all my apps . urg	-1
Tired of trying to download this it wont download at all wish I could give it 0 stars please fix it Glu it really needs it	-1
I do not have this so I ca n't really rate this I probable did but just do n't remember this sorry	-1
Is listed but does n't work . No control with either gamepad , mouse or remote . Kind of lame of it being listed .	-1
This & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; app is far from free ! After the first time using it , you were asked to update @ a cost to chose better weapons @ a cost . Theis was true the more you played . You did not have to upgrade but if you did n't it became very hard to hunt successfully.At least you should have been able to play for some time before having to pay anything . I would not reccomend to anyone who just want to have a good time trying and was able to do so until later in the game .	-1
I bought coins in the game and they never showed up . I tried to report the problem but links keep taking me places that wo n't help me . Please fix .	-1
yea its fun ... .. untill it froze my kindle for a whole day during when I was playing it everytime I played it. & gt ; : ( so it stinks basically	-1
It wo n't even open when I try to play it . It is a waste of money . DO NOT BUY THIS !	-1
Was a terrific game until standard region 4 . Ca n't do any of the hunts because the game glitches and freezes my kindle . If this gets taken care of I 'll change my review .	-1
All this app wants you to do is spend money to play the games offerred . and more money and more money . Very tedious	-1
I enjoy hunting and thought this may be a good one to use . Not happy with it . I 'm not a gammer and an old fart who does n't play games very often . It 's just very confusing for one who seldom plays these types of games .	-1
I do not like this game boring dose not work wast of time u do n't get to do anything really it 's a bad game do not get this game if u do u will get frustrated like me	-1
First shot I hit my target . Second shot I missed . Was not able to shoot again so the app is gone from my tablet	-1
I tried it because my husband is a deer hunter . I was n't impressed with it . Its ok for kids maybe .	-1
I guess if you are a hunter thiis might be good but I found it difficult to understand and took it off my Kindle . I thought it was too involved for someone how was just interested in seeing if I could shoot a dear . Guess I should never go hunting .	-1
This would have been a five star , but once the update occured , I could n't progress past area 3 . Trying to access level 4 crashed the game , and shut down my kindle . When I followed the advise from Amazon tech dept for a fix , it deleted all of my progress and paid weapon upgrades . It is now just sitting in my cloud taking up space . Glu Mobile Inc. needs to read all of the recent feedback , and fix this problem ASAP . Junk ! ! ! ! ! now .	-1
Only played a few levels . Ca n't really get into the game for the rating notification keeps popping up , It 's very distracting.So far the games just okay .	-1
Unfortunately greed has ruined this game . Progress is so severely limited by efforts to get you to purchase in game currency and in game currency is ridiculously expensive . I think this game is the & amp ; # 34 ; last straw & amp ; # 34 ; ... .. the one that has made me decide to give up on tablet games .	-1
this app manipulated me into a pay screen and was n't going to let me go until i bought a rifle . ther was no getting out of the screen without just turning off my device . if it had just let me play and let me do the deciding i would have liked it . the graffics are great and it works well otherwise	-1
after updated , region 7 came out but the whole games is not working . it exists all the time . can not rollback . not happy about it . too bad .	-1
if this app is not meant to run on 1st gen kindle so be it . do n't let it be available for download to 1st gen. works well on hdx but terrible on fire . crashes and freezes as if 1st gen hardware cant handle it . rovio should do Q/A and make sure . they probably made sure it would launch and nothing else .	-1
This game is not worth or ! You can olny play one character and that is just red bird.PLUS , when you are in last place , it is soooooooooo anoying how that pig shows up saying try again .	-1
I have not figured out how to play the game . I took it off my carousel and think I am going to remove from my device . Maybe it is a game for younger people . I have three other Angry Birds and I love them .	-1
Maybe it 's just me ; but I do n't think that everytime you finish a game you should be asked to buy something .	-1
I really liked this game at the beginning but then it started to freeze and it was horrible ! I could n't drive cause of it .	-1
Why ca n't it be on the regular kindle fire not HD WHY WHY WHY I ca n't download it make it be on the regular kindle fire	-1
I do n't know what is so awsome about these dumb birds but they 'll keep making these as long as they can profit off of merchandise ... failure	-1
Do n't get this game . Why ? Because it wo n't let u play ! Let me play or I 'M THROWING THIS APP OUT THE WINDOW ! ! ! ! ! Too late I already did ! If u want something worth playing get Cat Friends .	-1
My kids are heartbroken . We keep trying , but this game will simply not install , on the original Kindle Fire.It downloads OK , we have enough of space to fit it ( 94 MB or so ? and we have more than that free & available for apps , according to the & # 34 ; Device & # 34 ; in system settings ) . But then in the next phase , when actually installing , apparently it needs tons more space than that ? And never has enough , so the install fails with an error message about insufficient space.This keeps happening on 2 different original Kindle Fires in our household , so it 's not just a problem with just one specific device.At least it was free .	-1
I do like most angry bird games.. it this one I just could n't grasp . I found it difficult to do and got frustrated easily . Yet again some may find this game amazing and the challenge to their liking . This is only my opinion so do n't take me seriously . I do hope some of you enjoy this game give it a try.. do n't let my negative thought discourage you .	-1
This might be a good game but it never loads ! It says angry birds has stopped so I click okay then I try reloading it and usage THE same thing so do n't download	-1
The update from yesterday ( Feb. 19 ) has messed up the game again . This has happened once before with this game . The game starts up and begins with the music and then just closes . Come on , Rovio . How long will we have to wait for a fix this time . Amazon , please let them know . And I thought you tested everything forever before you put it up in the store ?	-1
Right before I got this game I was excited it came out for Kindle Fire HD ! Right before I tried to play it went black and went to the front screen . I tried again and again and it did n't work . Waste of your time , if you wan na waste time and GB 's get this app . I do n't recommend this for anybody .	-1
Do n't enjoy it . But I will keep trying to see the merit in the game . I may have missed the point .	-1
I first tried to use the tilt but THAT was horrible ! I went to the settings to change and it was worst ! I guess because it was free you get what you pay for ? I tired to delete it off my carousel and I did but it came back . I want fun not frustration . Thank you .	-1
My son was very disappointed that we could not download it to his Kindle Fire . : ( I will re-review when it compatible with the Kindle . : )	-1
This game is fun at first but then after a little bit it starts asking for money and if you refuse you pretty much ca n't play at all	-1
Downloaded app but find it to be very buggy . The game keeps stopping and I have to reopened constantly . I feel it is not for my Kindle Fire Second Generation . It may work on newer Kindles .	-1
I 've uninstalled and reinstalled this app 3 times on my Kindle Fire and ca n't get passed the title screen . It stops and exits or says ca n't connect to app store .	-1
Ok so I saw this app and I thought I would try it because I have all the other angry birds apps . When I got it it worked perfectly and I loved it ! But after a while it would n't let my on the app . I am very angry because I like the app but I ca n't play it . I even tried deleting the app and redownloading it but that did n't work . Please rovio fix this . My brother got one of those telepods for Christmas and my kindle fire hd is the only device with a camera he can use it on and now it 's looking like we will have to return it =/	-1
It wo n't load on my kindle fire . It has taken about a week to download , and it keeps crashing . It really sucks .	-1
I downloaded this game for my step-son on his Kurio 7s and it works perfectly but when I downloaded it onto my Sony S1 it just wo n't open . When I click on it ... .it goes to a black screen like it 's trying to open and then it just goes off and takes me back to my homescreen . I have all of the other angry birds games on my Sony S1 but this one just wo n't work for me . I even thought maybe I didnt have enough memory or ram on my device so I deleted a bunch of other games we do n't play anymore and i deleted the angry birds go game and reinstalled it over and over again but still the same thing . Very disappointed . Hope that maybe an update or something can fix this .	-1
I was looking forward to playing this game , but alas it will not load . I am trying to run it on an Acer Iconia tablet .	-1
Put this on my Kindle mostly for my Granddaughter . She loves it but I hate it . Guess it 's mostly for kids	-1
Not use to racing apps and it was hard to understand how to control it . I guess a lot of younger people use to this fast paced racing would really like it . I LOVE all the other Angry Bird games .	-1
I thought this would be a fun game . It was for like the first 5 minutes until it kicked me off . I tried to play it a few more times but alas , it did n't let me play . it continued to kick me off . so I hope they fix that bug . until then I 'm deleting the app from my kindle .	-1
I know a lot of people that enjoy this game . But it just was n't right for me . My sister is so addicted to this game she has it on her phone and plays it a lot . So see what you think . It never hurts to try .	-1
I have four count em four , tablets.. Two are dual core , ddr3 ram ect . One is a tegra3 , and the other is a snap dragon quad core 2 GB of ram ... No dice on all four ... My tegra 3 is the worst . Just black screen.. Poor Dev.. Made for kindles and phones only ... Look at Google reviews and you 'll see I am not alone ... And another thing , , game is farcking huge.. With no move option.. Oh amazon and Google say its 107 megs , try over 400.. And grows at will . They need a move option.. And increased compatiblilty.. I did get it on my wife 's daul core lenvono by side loading it from a torrent.. But from amazon and Google , it says its not compatible..fix and add a move option , I even bought the useless toys and ca n't use them rovio sucks , just saying ,	-1
I have no clue since this game absolutely will not open . My 7 yr old begged me to get it , now I am dealing with a boy who is beginning to understand the frustration of cruddy apps . Not a fun thing for a parent to have to explain , but , well that 's life , son . Tried loading and opening fivetimes over two week period . Tried on kindle fire and sony experia tablet . It 's a no go , go , go go !	-1
Not sure why this acted like it would work on our Kindle Fire 1st generation as it would install and then you could try to start and the game would go nowhere . My kids like it on the Nook but no go on the Fire 1st generation .	-1
I do n't like it because the game never loads , so I have n't got to play it yet . I would like to try it , but ... .	-1
Want to get a decent car in this game or power ups ? Be prepare to send a TON on overpriced in-game purchases . Even for an average kart , You have to pay 50 dollars to get it . What a rip off .	-1
I can not even install this very app on my tablet which can not tell where the problem is from but might be useful some how	-1
it said I did n't have enough storage space on my kindle fire so I deleted about 15 apps and it still would n't work.so I really cant rate this app because I could n't play it .	-1
with out a controller this version isnt easy to do . I have it on my kindle so maybe on a laptop etc. , it might be better	-1
Not my kind of game , but that is not to say it is n't for someone who likes this time of game .	-1
It is fun but once you get to the last level it crashes and it gets boring do it is good to bad do not get this game	-1
this game is fun but 2 get ahead in the game u have 2 pay real money becareful some carts cost up 2 60 dollars dont let ur kids roam free i would get it but untill u need 2 buy stuff its fun after that its horible	-1
We love the Angry Bird series and unfortunately this one has n't worked out the installation bugs for Android . We 've played it on other platforms and it was fun ! .	-1
Why is this on here ? Its not on MY Kindle it made me VERY MAD ! WHY ? Because its not compatiable and thats why i like apple products MORE .	-1
This game is horrible , it told me that I need 206 % of space to play . Rovio what did you do ? I thought this game would be awesome but it 's just a rip off and a waste of time . I wish I could rate it better but I ca n't . Even if Rovio fixes these bugs I will not ( can not ) make a better review because you are only allowed to make 1 review per app . This app is a BIG disappointment . This app is probably the worst app Rovio ever made . Please Do n't Get This App You 'll Regreat It . & gt ; : (	-1
Not good or fun . Very disappointing . I think it should have had more details of what it really was so we knew before loading	-1
game looks fun but would not work right on my kindle but it is free so you might as well try it fyi it uses up a lot of storage space	-1
Not a game I am interested in . Probably more suited for children to play this . Glad I tried it free .	-1
I always heard of angry birds and thought it could be fun to viciously harm poor birds and innocent little pigs , reminds me of being back on the farm.Well this angry birds thing is like one of those ouija boards . It seemed harmless enough , Ya know then it started.I heard a thwop on my bedroom Window and looked outside to find a bird had hit my Window . It happens no big deal . Then while driving a bird hit my windshield . Weird but still happens not my fault.Then a bird hit me and flew away as I was walking to the store to pick up some bacon which I dropped and a second bird grabbed in its talons and flew away with . As I write this in my darkened room I can hear the thwop of birds hitting my windows from all sides trying to get at me . Yea fun at first , then you open the flood gates to bird hades and you will never escape . Be careful what you play . You just might get more in return than you asked for or wanted ... Thwop ... Thwop ... Thwop ... Thwop ... Thwop ...	-1
I am a wait til it comes on line to stream . Many movies not worth the ticket price . A lot of really old and obscure movies are used . I had to do a lot of cheating looking up on the internet.Recommend to people who know a lot about movies .	-1
I Never lets you play for more then thirty seconds and you never win enough to cover what you bets yep I like it but at the same time it 's bad	-1
Game does not play , after a couple of spins all credits are gone with no wins . Not fun to play .	-1
I HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO ALL NEW GAMES AND GIVEN FAIR REVIEWS.THIS GAME HAS IMITATED TITAN SLOT HD BUT IS ONLY INTERESTED IN TAKING YOUR REAL DOLLARS and returning it with poor returns.SORRY I HAD TO BE YOUR FIRST REVIEW . I ONLY AM ONE OF MANY !	-1
The game rarely gives a bonus : and when it does it does n't pay anything . Way to expensive and not much fun . So far I have n't even gotten beyond game 1 ! Let 's talk about ads . They are endless . I would NOT recommend this game to anyone .	-1
The game never has played long enough to see if is any fun . It never gives you any wins and I get bored going back for hours and hours to try to accumulate enough to play on .	-1
Please delete this order . I do not want it . Thank you very much . It was not what I expected and would like you to delete it.Barbara Sweat	-1
I was having problems with one of my other digital bibles so I gave this one a shot . It fell short of my expectations . You needed to purchase additional books of the bible . I ca n't say more than that because that 's as far as I was interested . It 's been deleted from my kindle and I 've restored my former Bible which seems to be working now that I 've set a new account for it . This NIV live was free so I lost nothing in trying it .	-1
You have to pay for each book of the Bible after the first book . Try a different app to read the Bible .	-1
I am disappointed with the product . I selected it because it said $ 0.00 cost however I did not suspect that when I selected NLT as the translation of choice for me that it would cost me . That is why I am disappointed and removed the app within minutes of loading in to my Kindle Fire tablet .	-1
useless , it mainly wants you to buy an upgraded version , this version . this version would not work on my kindle fire .	-1
This is not what we wanted this app was a mistake by my husband and we need it removed we like the nkv better	-1
I wish I had allowed my eyes to see exactly what I was purchasing . Although it was right in sight , I failed to really see . & # 34 ; LIVE & # 34 ; means audio , herein was my problem . Each book and chapter must be purchased for audio usage . I am removing it from my Kindle Fire HD .	-1
Did n't keep it , turned out to be a free app to buy other things . Not what I was looking for !	-1
Another game with poor instructions - after trying to figure it out it was deleted - these games would be good with instructions right at hand .	-1
I have been trying for a few days now and this app is just not delivering . It seems to be working at first but at the very final stage , it crashes . I have tried many times , rebooted , reinstalled , the same thing	-1
Did n't find this app helpful to have on my kindle at all . Also did n't function as I had expected it would .	-1
After this was FAOTD , the Dev updated with a new permission to run at startup . There is no good reason for this app to run at startup . I will uninstall .	-1
I liked this app so much i bought the license key for the full version but i noticed that i noticed a battery drain . I would leave my kindle fire sitting at 60 % for 2 hours with no games or anything running and come back to the battery being at 40 % - this is not normal for my kindle fire . After uninstalling it my battery usage went back to normal so i wont be installing it again .	-1
I downloaded this to my kindle fire and was having a hard to with selecting one of the free channels ( American Prime ) so I called for assistance . I received someone who was so clueless and never listened to my problem . I got so exhausted trying to re-explain that I finally just said the heck with it and removed the app .	-1
Do n't buy this . They 're selling FREE information to you . They 're just suckering you because you did n't know you could do a web search and find the same sort of private channel list for free.Honestly , this is not worth the money . It 's free information . Go search now . You 'll find it .	-1
You can do the same thing on the Roku yourself . You did n't have to setup account . Forget it buy something else .	-1
The app ape appear to do what it claims , but I can not see it adding anything needed to my android device . Simple folders on my home screen gives me everything this app does.Now the permissions , pair yo Bluetooth why ? Access and change both WiFi and network status ? If I need to turn any of them on or off then access the power setting in the pull down is faster .	-1
The bottom right , multiple app icon on a Nexus 7 lets me switch from app to app by tapping , then choosing , already . I do n't need any cutesy icons just to do what I ( and many others , I 'm sure ) can already do . To heck with all the permissions , we 're talking about a waste of storage space , too ... .Yawn . PASS !	-1
I found it got in the way a lot when i was using my phone . If you need more space on your desktop get a launcher that lets you customize that sorta thing .	-1
I can do the same thing without this app , so ... . ? ? ? And also , when a Developer posts a video showing how the app works , and the video does n't show up correctly , that is probably a good indication to pass on it . Lastly , it looks like it was either designed for , or by , little kids . If I had paid for this app , I would now be asking for a refund . Deleted from my device .	-1
Not only is this app completely redundant for anyone that bothers to power their Android device on at all , but it also contains both Admob and Adsense -- which should not exist in a full version paid `` Pro '' app.This has absolutely nothing of value and should be avoided even for free.1 star .	-1
really , how lazy do you have to be . yep sure your time is important . because you are so important and do n't have the few extra seconds to switch between apps . yep do n't have time for that.once their was a thing called a rotary dial phone where you had to . ( gulp ) pick up the handset and actualy dial the number and wait for the little circle to complete uts rotation . horrible to go thru all that trouble.thank goodness our lives have become so important that we no longer have rniugh time to do simple tasks any longer.really people . the truth of the matter is we have just become lazy and want everything done for us.what would you do if things werent done for you . could you possibly survive another day . is it worth the extra two seconds saved.stop being lazy . there is more time in a day than you know . more stuff in life to do than sit staring at your phone . the world is a beautiful place . go out there and discover it snd stop being so lazy .	-1
You have to really be a person who eats out all of the time to know what the logos are . Stuck at the current one , and will be removing this from my Kindle .	-1
Another one I see no point in using.I do n't want to play games with burger king etc ... .some one younger would probably enjoy this	-1
Fun for a gal who grew up in the 70 's and saw nothing but commercials and fast food joints and jingles . BUT , this app has too much ad-ware . It makes the app not worth downloading . I got fed up and deleted it .	-1
Why do n't you have the whole name ? ie- why is Olive Garden just Olive ? Dunkin Donuts just Dunkin ? Makes no sense ! !	-1
I guess I do n't get out enough . I recognized the first batches , but then , I guess logos got a little localized . They certainly are n't popular where I live .	-1
After you 've reviewed all the restaurants & their logos , you 'll discover that you only actually know only about 20 % of those that are presented . Kind of takes the fun out of it .	-1
very boring the kids do n't play it	-1
at least on my Kindle HDX . It will load and then nothing . It locks up and you can only get out of it .	-1
1 . The letters are messed up2 . The clear blocks are spaces3 . To rap it all up , IT RARELY WORKS .	-1
its horrible i got tacobell and it had 9 letter spaces and a blank letter dont get it its horrible	-1
I do n't like this game . It is very annoying . When I press a letter it do n't work I have to keep pressing it . It is frustrating . Also half my answers are right and they mark it wrong . Then they dare to ask me to review them ? I am definitely deleting it . If it costed anything it would n't be worth it at all . No wonder why it 's free . I do not recommend it . One star . WORST game ever .	-1
Reviewed by my 9-year old daughter : DO N'T GET THE APP ! ! ! ! ! ! It 's a bad idea of a game and such bad graphics and you do n't have a eat button ! I only played the game for 2days so after the second time I deleted the game . Buy the game and then you 'll have to get rid of it . You must not get the game ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! DELETE THE APP ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( Bad since it does n't have a eat button ) : p	-1
Reply neutral the moon in your face and the moon is Tyler and the invite them in a house in your room and the moon is Tyler Perry has to the moon in a chest pain of age and the invite them in this game I will build	-1
This would be a better mmo needs more graphics and better controls like in mmorpg project with less twitchy controls and for it to explain how you eat .	-1
I found this game because it was listed on IO9.com under their & amp ; # 34 ; deals & amp ; # 34 ; blog . It was free after previously being offered at $ 5 . For a $ 5 game to have an in game ad banner is kind of ridiculous . A banner that blocks the help button and calibrate button . But it does go away for a few seconds and I pressed the help button . That 's how I found out the dial which I thought was a broken altimeter or airspeed indicator was really a turbo button . Yeah ... ok . The big red non descript button is a brake . Visually I think the graphics are acceptable but the ads , interface and fun factor ( lack of ) just kill this game ever hoping to earn $ 5 let alone $ 1 . Just downloaded it for FREE and it 's not worth the 40mb worth of space it takes up on a 32gb SD card . Keep working on it and maybe , just maybe .	-1
my son is 4 years old and isnt really interested in this app as much as he is into the other apps we have for him	-1
wo n't work unless you pay , it says it is free but it freezes and wants money to open it . Not what it said . My granddaughter was wanting to play it so bad but I had to tell her it did n't work and uninstall it .	-1
good for kids , but not for adults . i could see my neices under five being enthralled by the game and fixing up the dolls	-1
I 'm a grown adult who plays many app games , including my toddler 's as I help him navigate through them . He was so frustrated with this because we had no idea what to do and spent more time pressing the screen , trying to do things than actually getting any results . I could n't even hand the Kindle over to him because he would have just cried out of frustration that the game was n't doing anything . I ended up deleting it shortly after purchasing .	-1
The message of this app is if you 're sick you will never be well . What a message to give a young child . I found this depressing and frustrating . My grandson and I did n't like it at all .	-1
I love the Hexlogic puzzles ... however , this puzzle is not a picture puzzle but a series of dot hexagons that have to be selected to make the picture . This was not clear in the description of the product . i bought two of these and do not like them at all ; some people might , but Hexlogic needs to be more clear in the description so the buyer knows what they are getting..	-1
Opens slow and is just not any fun , I have not been able to play much , but does not keep me interested .	-1
Fast pace games but very little action . From my perspective not enough winning spins or bonuses . The games could go for 20 spins with no results . Graphics are nice but with small returns does not keep interest .	-1
So far the odds are OK , but the popup to buy in app stuff is more than other games . Really annoying is the requirement to use Facebook to use full features of the game . If you do n't sign on to Facebook , it says you are a guest on your own device .	-1
There you go once again , coins did not last long enough , and I refuse to do in app purchasing..It is a game folks , you should not have to buy coins to play .	-1
super fun game I was excited to play on my kindle finally but I have spent half a million credits and have not received one bonus	-1
It is stuck on loading and I never get to play it . Probably because I do n't have coins so so	-1
I read the reviews as always and tried it . I bought coins twice . And my coins get taken away when I 'm not on there . Yesterday I had 11,000 coins and I did n't play it for 3 hrs . When I got back on there I was down to 2,000 coins . That happend twice . At first there was good payouts . Now I have none . I would n't recommend this game to anyone . I 'm deleting game now . End of rant..	-1
I did n't realize it costs money to play it . I should have read the reviews before I got it . Deleted it .	-1
Loaded it and threw it out . I am insulted when any game demands that i buy the opportunity to play with my credit card . No , i do n't want to go to the casino . No , i do n't want to spend money playing a game on my Fire .	-1
have downloaded other casino games that have more glitz.Will use mostly on camping or hiking trips to relieve boredomNot the best graphix	-1
I just got this game . I all ready hate .It had to many adds.At the beginning of the game it froze.Then I turned it off then back on again .Then nothing showed up . Don ` t get this game . : ( : ( : ( : ( : ( : ( LOVE . 0 Karisa	-1
If I could this game would be a zero . Too many ads and not a darn thing good thing to say about any part of this piece of digital junk .	-1
After playing for a while , you must purchase more play or your can no longer play . I feel like I was duped .	-1
its fun but it wont let me buy any bikes and says you lose even when your in first place	-1
This is a pretty decent game for me , but only decent and 2 starworthy because I think it has more than a few programming errors , like more than a few times now I know I 've placed first , and beentold I failed when I 'm positive i was first , which keeps me fromleveling up to level 4 , ( could be I will never achieve level 4 at all ) at this rate ) . which will mean another star deducted.Another bad thing is their does n't seem to be a settings screenor button I can use to turn off the loud annoying backgroundnoise they call music.other than that the game plays pretty smoothly and the controls ( tilt accelerometer ) is pretty responsive.Please recheck the code for programming flaws/errors and I'llgladly re-rate the app .	-1
While it is quality journalism , I was disappointed by this version . You can get more from other papers on the Internet without the aggravation .	-1
DO YOU KNOW WHY I GAVE THIS APP ONLY 1 STAR ? WELL -- THERE IS A VERY GOOD REASON -- AND IT IS AN INTERESTING ONE SINCE THE OWNER OF AMAZON RECENTLY BOUGHT THE WASHINGTON POST WHICH HAD BEEN FAMILY OWNED FOR YEARS.THE REASON ? YOU CAN ONLY USE THIS APP A VERY SHORT TIME UNLESS YOU PURCHASE -- YES PURCHASE -- A DIGITAL VERSION . NOW -- THE USA TODAY NEWS APP FOR KINDLE IS FREE -- AND IT IS DARN GOOD . FREE.AND THE NEWS HOG APP IS FREE- YEP FREE- AND IT IS DARN GOOD . SO I SAY , & # 34 ; TO HECK WITH THE NEWLY PURCHASED WASHINGTON POST & # 34 ; -- - IF THERE IS AN IMPORTANT ARTICLE IN THE WP -- IT WILL APPEAR IN USA TODAY OR NEWS HOG OR THE HUFFINGTON POST -- - ANOTHER FREE APP THAT DOES NOT -- NOT- NOT ASK YOU TO PURCHASE A DIGITAL VERSION -- AS DO MANY OF THE MAGAZINES THAT AMAZON OFFERS FOR SO-CALLED & # 34 ; FREE. & # 34 ; HENCE , I DELETED THIS APP FROM MY KINDLE -- THANK YOU SO MUCH ! ! ! !	-1
I was happy wieth the app until I learned that I would have to pay for it monthly . I am Scottish by nature ... .I hope that this does not affend any PC people out there ... .so I cancelled the app .	-1
I was able to have a conversation , so it gets some stars . Biggest issue was on the other end- everyone I spoke with said there was a bad echo on their end , that everything they said was repeated . Was fine on my end , but not worth keeping if the other person ca n't enjoy the conversation .	-1
was not what i wanted..so i uninstalled it..would be grate if i knew what i was doing lol . good for others i guess .	-1
Okay , but not my favorite . I played it a few times and deleted it . Sometimes on these Mahjong apps , they make the board too dark to see which tiles are open .	-1
The ads at the bottom of the page sometimes blocks what you need to play . I found the ads distracting	-1
Nice game except I have an issue with how the game gets larger and LARGER and LARGER as a board proceeds . It is extremely annoying and off-putting .	-1
The game itself is great ... but it wo n't let me click on the items ... .and if I try clicking too many times , I get the cracked screen penalty ... it would be wonderful if it worked..	-1
It would not load on Kindle fire ... did not pass go did not collect 200 dollars do not download this app	-1
Way too glitchy despite beautiful graphics I give it one star . As others have stated , it is VERY slow to respond and I ran into the same problem others did that I could tap on the item all I wanted- the game would n't respond and I was stuck .	-1
This game is so boring NEVER get it if your epic like ME ! If you want a REAL show stopper download MovieStarPlanet !	-1
I got it to work once and when I finished the level it froze so I had to do a hard reboot . I ca n't open the program now since it keeps freezing my kindle really badly . The game was fun the one time I played it . If there is an update for the kindle fire then I might come back to it . I am glad it was free so I did n't waste my money	-1
How anyone can give this more than one star is beyond me . The flashing ads were so bad I could n't even play it . My daughter was trying to sleep next to me and said that 's so bright I can see it with my eyes closed ! Horrible .	-1
The game crashes nine times out of the ten times I try to play it . Am I the only one with this problem ? When I do get to play it I like it a lot . Fun and challenging .	-1
I prefer candy crush , not to thrilled about this app , played it a couple of times , thought it was boring .	-1
The game was fun , but I had to uninstall it after about 10 levels . As I kept moving up in levels , it kept flashing more and more pixels all around the screen until it just froze altogether and would not do anything .	-1
You ca n't advance . Mostly a timed game to see if you can beat your time . The graphic are a little too small for me and the game gave me motion sickness .	-1
This game was too repetitious and left the player wondering what the game was actually about . I do not recommend this game .	-1
I got Diamond Gems mainly out of curiosity . Having done so , I find it was not a game I enjoyed .	-1
I have read everybodys posts about not compatible with fire hd . I can not get it to download to kindle fire but had no problem with fire HD . still upset not on fire cause now my daughter is on my kindle .	-1
I have 6 devices including android phones , kindles , tablets and this app is compatible with NONE : ( check your devices before you buy a boom : (	-1
This game was way too easy . I finished all the levels in about 10 minutes . I guess it would be ok if it was free , but I 'm a bit mad that I paid for it .	-1
I like the graphic a lot but was disappointed that it was so simple and so much the same thing over and over . I like games like Vacation Quest Hawaii where there are different items and they get moved around .	-1
This game is pretty easy so there 's not much of a challenge . The rooms are nice but not a million dollars worth ! I found I was able to complete all the rooms fairly quickly .	-1
There are no items to find except silhouettes of 15 or 20 of the same item . This is boring and hard to find the objects if you have any vision problems .	-1
The only reason it 's getting one star is because it 's required . This game us horrible ! In each room you look for 15 of one item . Horrible hidden object game . Would n't even recommend even if it were free .	-1
If it was n't for the energy requirements and having to wait for more ( especially if you are like me and wo n't buy more ) I would be on this game a lot more ! Reminds me of Dig Dug , its so much fun.Update : With the addition of acid , lucky , and space levels , you have an opportunity to increase your loot drops and experience gained . However to play these levels you would probably have to invest a bit for the extra energy , especially since it costs double the usual energy to play them . That would take a big chunk out of your playing time.Originally you get four energy to play , acid level costs you two each game so it 's not worth it unless you invest in the shop for more base energy . Energy refills every 15 minutes and levels only take a minute or less . If your like me , it 's a fun game but not worth waiting for more energy to play . That includes if you spent the.99 for more energy , which only increases your base to 8 . Totally NOT worth it . I have downgraded my original five star rating do to the changes in time you given to play ( even if you 've bought more base energy ) .	-1
