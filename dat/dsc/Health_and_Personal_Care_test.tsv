Now I would totally give this a 5 star rating if it worked because easy to use , and very comfortable ! I 've tried several times pairing this and unpairing it to see if it would create a accurate heart rate could not get it to work properly . I use the spectra electrode gel so I know that was not the issue.I thought it was maybe just be the battery but I replaced it and still having same issues . I guess either I got a bad unit or you get what you pay for.The strap on the unit is comfortable , I 've tried it running and biking and no issues what so ever but the heart rate is irractic and jumps from 80 to 160 while sitting here not moving ! The unit also just turns off and you have to take the unit off the strap for like 30 seconds and then reattach to have it reconnect to your device.I tried a friend of mines who has the Polar H7 and it works great . I was trying to save some money and go cheap but as always cheap is not better.I did however like how easy the unit paired and comfort level I 'd say excellent . I did n't even know it was there after it was properly adjusted . At this point I am not sure if I just got a faulty unit or if its just how this unit is produced . I do like that the battery is easily changable , that is a great feature . I really thought I found a reliable device at a decent price : ( really disappointedUPDATE7/31/13Received a replacement unit and the replacement works great ! Ca n't complain about nothing now ! Thanks ! Easy to pair , easy to use , and seems very accurate !	1
this product have kept my teeth looking cleaner and brighter . the extra strips in this package is wonderful because of the original values .	1
Crest Whitestrips are the best whitening product you can buy without visiting your dentist . I always buy the ones numbered either 4 or 5 , and can see a difference after one use . After several treatments , everyone starts commenting on how beautiful my teeth are . The strips really stick to your teeth ( no sliding off ) , and you can drink with them on . They do make my teeth somewhat sensitive but , afterwards , I use a fluoride gel that I purchased from my dentist , which really helps . Also , for a few days after each treatment , your teeth will be more porous and prone to staining from coffee , tea , red wine , blueberries , etc . so , in order to achieve maximum whitening , you should forego these foods and drinks for a few days ( or longer ) .	1
Could not find these in the local drugstore so I purchased online . They are exactly what I was looking for .	1
These may be small but they really work well . I use them when I am feeling tired . They revive my achy feet , back , neck , hands , shoulders , knees , basically any part of the body where they are used . The foot rubz are easy to handle and very easy to use . You can apply as much or as little pressure as you need . Great invention !	1
This was exactly what I wanted ... great description and great product . I 'm happy with the quality of the product and would definitely order from Due North in the future .	1
Get these . Use them once a day minimum no matter what . Your body will thank you . Much much MUCH cheaper than any other form of massage , chiro , yoga , PT , OT , etc . There is no comparison price or quality , these are the ones to buy , HIGHLY RECOMMEND ! ! ! ! !	1
Got these to help with trigger point pressing ( me being a novice , I only knew that you needed something like that for getting 'into ' the points better without getting more pain going in your arms and fingers from all the pressing ... ) onto points in my back , butt , and leg due to back problems and some nerve damage and whatever . Did not get them for my feet , and will not be using them on my feet , so I can not say how they work for that , but they certainly help with applying pressure into sore points , and they are just the right size for it -- not so small that the make a hole in you , not so large that they miss the point ( pun intended ) .They are HARD -- not squeeshy . So if you are looking for a ball with a 'give ' , this is not for you . The knobbly porcupine bits are a bit more flexible , but barely . For me , this works , because I do n't want too much 'give ' when I need to press into a point.They can leave funny little marks on your body right after pressing into ( think of it as temporary 'tattoo 's and proof of your hard work ... ) , so I would not recommend falling asleep with your cheek on one ... ( yep , happened to someone in my household , made for funny cheek ) , or working on your thigh right before you don bikinis ... But other than that -- go ahead . These are effective . I bought two -- it came in a pair -- but probably could'a made do with on . I can only use one at a time for the trigger points , anyway .	1
For those people that can put up with the pain/ pleasure of a real strong foot massage , these massage balls are a great alternative.My feet take a beating every day from wearing 3-4 inch heels at work and it is such a pleasure to get relief through these well made massage balls . I also use these for my shoulder blades and to release my hip flexors/ IT bands .	1
My niece loved these when I massaged her feet with them . I like using them myself for my hands ( early arthritis ) and on my arches .	1
i use these after i work out , or even after wearing heels all day . easy to throw in an over night bag ( great for after dancing the night away at a wedding )	1
I had initially purchased this two massage ball set for my wife but I also began using them . They do give a great massage to not only the hand , foot and back , but also to other parts of the body like the arms , chest and legs as well . I workout out hard every day and I found that just using this ball massager a few minutes on my chest , stomach , hands , feet , and arms made them feel better , taking away some of the muscle soreness.If you have muscle soreness because of arthritis or because of working out , you may want to check out this set of massage balls . I do think the price is a little high for them , but search around and I am sure you can pick up similar ball massage products at a bargain price.Rating : 4 Stars . Joseph J.

Not the most glamorous product to review , but the item does the trick . It helps with my feet primarily . I have n't seen the same results for my hands but maybe that 's because my hands do more activities during the day than my feet do . The objects are firm and are not soft as some may think . Comes in a small package and you can use them one at a time , or both together .	1
fantastic balls for my feet .	1
I got these babies for me and my sister . I 've got some nerve damage in my hands and feet and she had the fun of nearly being roadkill -- and both of us could use some mild muscle stimulation . They are the perfect size to stuff in bag for use at a desk at work or on the floor of an exercise joint , and the firmness level is just right for enough pressure without causing discomfort . Love them .	1
Pretty goodIt 's good to work ur way in . Start soft and slowly put pressure ... Anyway it works , I like it .	1
These massage balls are durable and effective . Great stress releiver and relaxation . Very easy and convenient to use . Anywhere you are standing ( talking on the phone , drinking a cup of coffee , ... ) this ball will feel great on the soles of the feet . Rolls smoothly and hits all the accupressure points . Highly recommend ! Adults and kids both love them .	1
I got these for foot massage but they really relaxed my hands when I rolled them in my palms . Also felt great on my arms and neck .	1
These actually work . They help loosen up the knots in my forearms that build up after pushing my wheelchair all day .	1
Best massage device for the money . Gentle , yet firm . Works well on most parts of the body but for the feet it is absolutely devine . Will buy more for gifts , will not dissapoint .	1
My BF uses these after a long day of work . They work well and seem to release some tension . I 've tried them too . They are a good size .	1
I am very please with these massage balls they are very good for my foot therapy and I 'm glad I purchased them	1
Weird ! Roll your foot over this thing to relieve pain ... But I think it works or at least helps . I have Achilles tendonitis in my left heel & it hurts really bad sometimes . I had to stop running because of it . This massage ball does seem to help ~ I 'm sure it 'll just take time to heal . They did n't cost much so it was worth a try .	1
I have bought more self massagers then I can count . Being a massage therapist myself I know the benefits of massage . These little guys work great to get in the spots that other self massagers ca n't . A good little investment .	1
These balls work great on the plantar tendon , they are a little rough but it works out the plantar real good .	1
My feet used to hurt a lot after a long walk . I would used this to massage the soles of my feet and it helps give that Ahhh moment . I would recommend this to anyone that wants to cost effect way to massage their feet . No frills just simple and effective .	1
Love these ! Great for feet or hands . Also , I discovered I can stand against a wall and put it behind my back and use it that way , too . Perfect amount of give , and the knobbies feel great . Warning - keep away from your dogs . LOL My big Lab saw it and wanted to steal it . LOL	1
Works great in my Maytag front loading washer . My washer is outside -- in a humid part of Texas -- and needless to say it did n't take long to build up a beautiful funk inside the bin . Drop one of these babies in , run a quick cycle , and I 'm good to go .	1
Cleans the washer very good before I tried these I was using bleach which was working for the mold smell but I was not sure it was cleaning the drum of dirt and detergent leftovers . Everything looks like new no smell of mold just a clean sent . Just a tip is to leave the washer door open when not in use to let it dry out completely . I recommend these tablets and I have given samples to my daughter and mother in law for them to tryout but have n't gotten any feed back yet . I will recommend that everyone use as little detergent as possible in these HE washers . I ran three wash cycles in a row to clean it out because I had never used anything but a little bleach .	1
I have been using these tablets in my high efficiency washer and by using them they have kept my lines and clear and my clothes really clean .	1
I love this product and have routinely purchased larger packages of three . I was delighted to be able to find this product in six packs . This will last 18 months if you clean your washer monthly.The product itself is long overdue . Even usuing conventional washers this product would be beneficial . I live at the beach and washers get full of sand and salt spray from the clothing , towels , and area rugs . Not to mention everyday dirt and grime . Something needed to be invented to aid in keeping washers clean years ago . Use to I would just run a empty load and fill it with lots of chlorine bleach . These tablets do a much better job and leave the washer smelling fresher.I have been using this product since I purchased my Whirlpool top loading HE washer a year ago . It has kept the inside of my washer sparkling clean and it still looks like new inside . The tablets totally disolve and leave no residue .	1
Good price and nice to stock up on . I like to take care of my energy efficient washer and this product works	1
Have used this product since I got my HE washer . It came with my washer and I have used it ever since . Never had any smell I hear that some people do.Gave my daughter a packet to use in her regular washer and she said it had never looked or smelled better .	1
Since my corgi became incontinent I do a & # 34 ; Gillie load & # 34 ; of laundry every day or every other day . I got some of these because the very idea made my husband turn green , and found I really like the product . Fortunately Amazon carries them in bulk and for a good price !	1
I did n't know from where I was going to get these . That annoying light on my new washer insists that I pop one of these in to clean it and the only one I had was the one that came with the washer . Glad that I found them .	1
but you wo n't get a close shave like you do with a razor . The accessories like the guards are useless and hard to clean .	1
For the price , this is a pretty good setup . It worked well to keep the fine fuzz under control and trim the eyebrows . It even worked on nose hair .	1
Comes with a little drawstring bag that protects it and stores all the parts . Works great ( AFTER I had to ask my husband why the battery was n't working - guess I 'm an idiot because it did n't work for me when I tried it ! ) . Even better than the micro-touch I 'd been borrowing from my DH .	1
This is a great product to be able to loose weight . The drops work allot easier and faster than the caps do . A couple of drops a day and the bottle goes a long ways .	1
Garcinia Cambogia is a great weight loss supplement because it is all natural and very effective.. these liquid drops are great , I prefer them over the pill form . It works great by suppressing appetite , keeping from overeating . And I hardly ever get cravings anymore ! It gives a great boost of energy , leaving me feeling fantastic , and dropping the pounds . I am so happy I tried these drops , they are the best weight loss supplement I 've tried .	1
I use this more than the more expensive chin straps I have bought . Fits my head better . I absolutely love it . Hope it lasts a while .	1
I have tried other chin straps but this is the best I 've come across . I ordered a large because my head usually is too big for hats . The headgear for my CPAP is a medium but the large chin strap is fine.I like the design that is adjustable `` heightwise '' and `` widthwise '' . I 'm able to get a comfortable fit.So much better than the chin straps I 've tried that are a single strap or a single strap with an added velcro strap in the back .	1
I bought this for multi-purpose crafting use : dry shampoo , body butter , simple fragrance oil , and candles . It is a very decent , sweet strawberry fragrance . It worked really well in my dry shampoo recipe ; three drops was enough to scent a full one-cup batch , and the scent has lasted for over three months , even with an open container . This is more of a sweet , strawberry candy scent than the drier , almost tart organic strawberry oils ( which are , imo , less strong , more expensive , fussier to get right , and do n't last nearly as long ) . It reminds me of Strawberry Shortcake dolls , versus , say , Bath & Body Works & # 34 ; Fresh-Picked Strawberries & # 34 ; hand lotion . When used as a straight perfume oil or top-note , I 've found it has a fairly decent 2-3 hr staying strength ; this scent in the dry shampoo actually lasts all day . The quality of the oil is pure enough that it has n't caused any skin irritation in any of my family members with sensitive skin ( knock wood ) .I 've also used this to scent strawberry-orange candles . It can get a bit pricey because it takes 2-3 of these bottles to scent a 16oz batch ( I vary the ratio with organic orange essential oil ) , but this is actually a decent oil because the scent throw is fairly strong in both paraffin and soy wax . Strawberry scent is notoriously difficult to work with in scented candles , but this one is n't too bad . It 's not strong enough to do a full kitchen/LR at once , but the scent throw in a 4oz candle is strong enough to fill a bedroom or bath . If you 're going to make a lot of candles , there are other brands that work better for less money ( eg , Candlescience ) but this is fine for starter purposes.Oil warmers : not the best , but still passable . I 've found it works best when cut with another oil or fragrance ; if I use the bottle alone it 's overpowering for about an hour , then quickly fades to nothing .	1
This fragrance oil smells so incredibly good . I feel like I 'm in a room completely full of strawberries but it is not too overpowering .	1
this strawberry oil is the best and the only product on the top of my list . and the price is excellent . with JP you get the best and thanks JP for an excellent , outstanding affordable product , I use this in my hand crafted creams , and bodybutters .	1
Since strawberry is one of the few fragrances I 'm not allergic to , I bought this to put into an unscented liquid soap , so I could have a nice smelling soap that would n't trigger my repiratory allergies . This worked out great . The smell is very strong , but also very accurate . I could n't be happier and I look forward to trying others from this company . I would definitely recommend this . Thank you P & J for making such a wonderful product .	1
Nice strong fresh strawberry smell . I bought this for my teenage daughter who loves the smell of fresh strawberries to wear as a perfume . She 's very happy with this strawberry oil , It 's very , very strawberry ! It 's perfect for her , and It 's making me hungry for some fresh strawberries !	1
So glad I could order 600mg in such a large bottle so reasonably priced . My mom has COPD and we give these daily . Now with the capsules I can give 600 mg so much easier and effectively . YAY	1
I 've been using Mucinex for years to prevent sinus infections , which it does very well when taken consistently ! I find if I take just one at night , every night , it prevents the sinus congestion that used to result in frequent infections for me . I LOVE that it 's now available in generic form , and the price for this brand is the lowest I 've seen !	1
A little expensive but what I needed . Works great ! ! I needeed a natural product without fillers etc . Great Wonderful ! Thanks	1
Not goopy , Goes on smooth and lasts . After a bout with skin cancer , I am using what I can to keep a recurrence at bay . I will continue to use this product .	1
I have to use major sunblock ( meds ) and EltaMD was recommended by my dermatologist . I received the lip balm and was happily surprised that it not only protects you from UV rays , but your lips are smooth and not dry at all and it lasts for HOURS-will order again !	1
Feels like regular lip balm and does n't have any sort of sunscreen taste . I 'm happy with this purchase and will likely buy it again .	1
this is a tube with a cream lip balm . Goes on great and offers excellent protection for the summmer	1
I started using cinnamon capsules as a way to try and keep my blood glucose in normal range . So will know if it has helped in improving my blood sugar	1
My blood glucose is usually around 103-111 and well within normal . Suddenly , on my last physical it jumped to 136 and I was n't very happy about that . I took immediate action . After research about which cinnamon to take I decided on this product.My glucose dropped to 96 which is normal but under what it usually would be as I stated above.I 'm going to take what I bought and when my next test rolls around I 'll see what is happening . I 'll be off the product about 45 days when I get tested again . I take 3 pills a day with meals as a suggested range.Do n't Buy the Chinese Cinnamon !	1
everyone will benefit from these capsules which lower your blood sugar and prevent worsened diabetes . better than tablespoons of cinnamon in your oatmeal	1
Ceylon vs. Cassia ... the more I read the more it lead to Ceylon with the idea that it CAN help lower blood sugar . It is too early to tell I will take them ( 1000 mgs per day ) for 180 days and then have a better idea .	1
Saw this product advertised on TV and Amazon had this available . It 's been a whilesince I ordered the product but finally used goo gone . I give it 5 stars because of the following : no harsh fumes , pleasant scent , no rubber gloves to wear , foam isdispensed with a pump trigger , safe for gas self cleaning ovens/grills .Wait 3-5minutes or for deeper cleaning anywhere from 30 minutes or longer , apply to coldoven , remove foam cleaner with water and wet sponge . I used this product on my GEXL-44 Gas Range/Oven which is over 20 years old which has done a lot of baking androasting over the years and this cleaner removed oven grease that other ovencleaners did not remove . Of course individual performance will vary from owner toowner but I 'm very happy with the results . I have a nice clean oven ! !	1
I took one of these every other day and it still seem to work . I lost about a pound a week	1
Although I did receive this product for free that does not mean my review is biased . This product really has helped me in my struggle to lose weight .	1
I am not sure about the full impact of this supplement on my weight loss , but I like it so far . I will update my post after a month .	1
I feel amazing . I eat less and have so much more energy ! I have much less appetite . I would recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for a supplement to their exercise and diet program . This is not a miracle drug but it definately helps with my program ! A must have for sure !	1
I love this product ! ! ! ! It keeps me alert and I do n't over eat like I did before . No side effects and my clothes are getting huge ! I do n't exercise , but I did change my eating habits and choose heathlier foods to eat . I dropped the regular pop and switched to diet soda , coffee , and water . I recommend this product to my family and friends .	1
Have been taking Earthwell green coffee supplement for about four weeks now . Have not changed my eating habits at all , and I have lost about 9 lbs . In particular some of the fat around my belly has gone . This seems effective so I am quite satisfied with my results .	1
This product is giving me energy and less hunger with out the jitters that you get from some weightloss products	1
so I decided to give this a try since Ive tried ALMOST everything ! It definitely helped me shed some pounds ! Am so glad I came across this product !	1
I 've already tried several supplements by Earthwell and have been very happy with them . I 've been interested in learning how Green Coffee Bean extract but aid in weight management so I thought I would give Earthwell 's formulation a try . It 's been gentle on my stomach so far and I have n't noticed any side effects . I 've already lost 2 pounds which is quite significant considering I 'm at the tail end of my weight loss goal . I 'm also glad that this supplement contains natural ingredients that I can feel confident ingesting . Thanks for the great product .	1
I was skeptical , but after shedding 12 pounds , you may call me a believer ! Just be sure to follow directions carefully !	1
I have been using this for a few days now working on my weight loss goals and I definitely notice a difference in my cravings for food . Highly recommended !	1
Have tried several brands , paid attention to reviews , and finally have had good results with this product . Diabetic A1C is dropping to near-normal , and am losing weight at the rate of 2-3 pounds monthly with no specific extra effort - that 's terrific performance , as it does n't represent a crash diet and its attendant yo-yo effect , nor does it remove weight so quickly as to threaten one 's well-being .	1
I ca n't say if it has helped me lose weight as I was an active runner and cyclist prior to ordering this but I can say my bmi has dropped 1.3 % . I feel like I have more energy in the morning when I take the first dose and when I begin my workout after the second dose . Placebo effect ? I ca n't say for sure one way or the other but as long as I 'm getting positive results with zero side effects , I 'll continue to be a user .	1
Great appetite suppressant , I 've been using this product since I received it and the pounds are just falling off . I take it one capsule 2x a day and it have really help me to loose weight . I do not feel as hungry and really do not have an appetite . If you are looking for a appetite suppressant this is it . I would recommend this product .	1
I am someone who has always been on a constant battle regarding my weight ; I have tried many diets and supplements , and every time there is something new in the market I always try it . When I first heard of the Green Coffee Bean Extract on the Dr. Oz show I was very excited as it gave me new hope on losing unwanted weight.This product does not disappoint ! On the first 7 days I lost a total of 5 lbs . It helps me keep my energy up during workouts and also helps suppress my appetite in between meals . What I love the most about this product is that it is all-natural and contains no artificial ingredients , which I ca n't say for some of the other green coffee bean products on the market . Definitely going to stock up on this product , especially while it is on sale !	1
I have tried several weight loss products to help me lose weight and get in better shape . Green Coffee Bean Extract gives a lasting energy boost and keeps my metabolism going strong . Surprisingly , I do n't have cravings for second lunch and late night snacks.I am down two inches off my waste and looking forward to dropping a few more sizes . ; )	1
This is a great product . I was taking it everyday . No jitters . I need to buy more . I used it for two months and it gave me energy and helped with my weight loss plan .	1
I have been taking green coffee bean extract for a couple months now and have lost most of my & # 34 ; baby weight & # 34 ; . It has curbed my appetite and I just do n't have the desire anymore to snack constantly . When I 'm hungry I actually go for more nutritious fruits and veggies and I certainly did n't do that before taking these . I have n't noticed any side effects .	1
However , since Gaia Herbs Liquid Iron is Gluten-Free and Yeast-Free ( and therefore highly preferable to me ) I have been able to soften the citrus upset by adding a couple of drops of Stevia to my daily doses . I am familiar with most of the ingredients - the exception being Sea Buckthorn -- a quick Internet search yielded the information I needed -- Sea Buckthorn is a small orange fruit that grows on certain beach areas as well as the desert . It is high in Vit C , as well as saturated and polyunsaturated fats . Parsley , Nettle , Dock , and Dandelion , also ingredients - are well known for their iron contant as well . I have never had any adverse reaction to any of those ingredients ( other than the mild stomach upset from the citrus ingredient ( s ) .Gaia seems to have done its research with their Liquid Iron , and although it is really too early to tell , I feel confident that this product will help boost my iron levels.The price is a little high , but compared to Floradix prices , it is comparable . Whoever manufactures the box should put some more glue on the bottom of the box ... .it almost opened up on me -- and the bottle inside the box IS glass .	1
I tend to get anemic very easily & have been advised to take iron supplements ... ... problem is-most of them come with nasty side effects for me . I saw this on Vine & decided to give it a try & I 'm glad I did . It does n't taste bad , does n't tear my digestive tract up like other supplements & I love the fact that it 's all natural , organic & plant based . I feel better & less tired when taking it , so that tells me it 's doing what it 's supposed to do . Highly recommend this product !	1
taste better than any other to date.My doctor has ordered me to take an iron supplement but I whined and said they taste so bad it is hard to dealwith them . I would spend the money on the herbal combination she suggested , take them for 2 or 3 days and forget the stuff was lurking in the fridge.However , my need for an Iron supplement outweighed my distaste of the product.When I was shipped this I said okay maybe this will be bearable.To my surprise it is . In fact as iron goes this is pretty tasty and it is loaded with everything a vegetarian needs to stay healthy.It is the kind of iron to be absorbed quickly and so will work better in the body.It is safe for children as well as pregnant women and as said before this really does taste good . It taste more like the herbs than the iron so taking the stuff twice a day is not overwhelming.As to the long term effects I can not speak to but now at least I am taking my iron.I am very pleased with this new product in my lineup .	1
Years ago my grandmother took a product called Geritol to address her `` iron poor blood '' . I do n't know that my blood is iron poor , but I do drink a lot of iron sapping caffeine and could certainly use an energy boost.Gaia is a responsible company and my experience with their products has generally been positive . If you go to their website and input a code found on the box , you can learn about the herbs used in the specific product you purchased . A bit gimmicky but the information is good.This tonic is liquid with a strange lemon honey taste . You can get it down without activating the gag reflex but they wo n't be naming drinks at Starbucks after it . The adult dosage is 10 ml twice a day . It comes with a plastic cup with the measurements ( 10 ml and 20 ml ) marked . Be sure to shake well before using . The product must be refrigerated after opening and used within thirty days.While I 've experienced no negative side effects , I ca n't say I 've noticed any benefits either . The refrigeration is inconvenient and I do n't think this is necessarily superior to an iron supplement in pill form or a multi vitamin containing iron . Each serving contains 10 calories , 2 grams of carbs , and 56 % of the RDA of iron . The expiration date on my bottle was 08/15.Final analysis ? This is an option if you ca n't or do n't like to swallow pills and you are religious about taking your supplements . The taste is bearable though not palatable and the refrigeration requirement may be an issue . Still the company is ethical and this product contains organic ingredients , no gluten or yeast . 3.5 stars	1
Aftertaste reminds me of eating sausage . It is actually not a bad supplement if you want to stay away from most US processed beef ( mad cow for US beef ) , or from metal shaving type supplements ( corn flakes , and some types of vitamin pills , which simply put raw iron in their products instead of bio-available iron ) .I would n't take this if you have a cold ( viruses thrive on iron , you need zinc instead ) . It 's also easy to overdose on iron if you are not careful and watch yourself.Overall this has increased my physical and mental endurance just a tad bit ( only a little bit ) .	1
About a week out of every month , I 'd been getting so weak and achy that I could barely function . My husband recommended that I try taking some iron during that week . After reading Elysia 's review , I knew that was just what I needed.It 's recommended that you take this stuff 15-30 minutes before eating . I 'm not one for dramatics , but after the first time I took this stuff , I was gagging for several minutes ! I need something in my mouth immediately to remove the taste . It has a honey ( ish ) taste somewhere in there . Somewhere ! if I did n't need it so bad , I could n't bare to take it.So far , I 've felt much better , though , so I have to say it 's working ! Note : You have to refrigerate this bottle after opening.It recommends you throw it away after a month.You have to shake well before each use.It recommends taking 10ML twice a day .	1
This is a great alternative way to get iron if you have problems with other iron supplements . There are nice ingredients included and I feel very energized since taking it . I did n't suffer any problems after introducing it into my regimen , with my stomach or anything else.The taste is indeed herbal , with a strange aftertaste that lingers at the back of my throat until I wash it down . It 's not too bad but takes a little getting used to . It has to be refrigerated after opening and tastes better cold . My first dose I took warm , which I do n't recommend . The thick glass bottle protects the integrity of the ingredients but can also break so it has to be carefully handled .	1
This does not taste bad at all . I mix it with a little powerade to chase it down . But could probably takes the 2 teaspoons straight . I 've only been taking this for a few days but can tell a difference . I do n't have & # 34 ; espresso shot & # 34 ; energy but I feel better . I will definitely keep ordering this since I am borderline anemic and suspect a low thyroid . Great product !	1
This is best iron supplement you can buy , hands down . We were devoted Floravital takers at my house , until Gaia came out with their version of a plant-based iron supplement . It tastes similar to Floravital ( a health-food store perennial best-seller ) , but the base ingredients of Gaia 's PlantForce are labeled organic or ecologically harvested , and it just has a fresher , more whole food feel to it . We love it.Each measured dose gives you 10 mg of elemental iron , the amount of pure iron most people can absorb at one time . As with the Floravital product , the directions advise taking two doses per day , split up . My only complaint is that Plant Force comes in just this size , which will only last you only 12 days if you take the full dose . Floravital comes in two sizes ; an 8.5 oz and a 17 oz , the latter lasting just under a month at full dosing . PlantForce really should come in two sizes as well.A word about iron supplement labeling : Natural Foods and Supplement products tend to label iron by the amount of ELEMENTAL iron the product contains . Pharmacies label by the compound ; the elemental mineral plus what the iron is bound to . This is can be very confusing for consumers if their doctor tells them to take , say , 300 mg of iron . This is a compound recommendation . So a `` 300 mg '' dose can contain anywhere from 30 mg to 100 mg of actual elemental iron , depending on the form . The 10 mg of elemental iron in PlantForce may seem small , but 10 mg of elemental iron is well absorbed , does not constipate , and wo n't hurt the tum tum.PlantForce is Gluten and Yeast Free , safe for kids over 6 , and should be refrigerated after opening . You 're supposed to use it up after 30 days . They warn you not to drink from the bottle . Safe drinking out there ! GRADE : AFun facts : Vit . C dramatically assists iron absorption , coffee dramatically inhibits it . Imbibe accordingly .	1
I used Floradix Iron + Herbs liquid extract for many years . That is the closest product I know of to the Gaia Herbs Liquid Herbal Iron . When using Floradix , in a short time I felt a noticeable and reliable increase in energy and general well-being . I have not noticed that so far with Gaia and I am about 2/3 of the way through the bottle . I can not find a list of the herbs in Floradix so I can not do a direct comparison of the ingredients to see what the difference might be . Others seem to have responded very well to the Gaia product , but I have not felt any change since I began using it.The taste of the Gaia herbal iron is similar to Floradix , perhaps slightly less sweet . Gaia does offer one nice touch , which is a code you can enter on their website to allow you to trace the sources of the herbs in your particular bottle . Their website also offers a lot of information on individual herbs . Unlike Floradix , Gaia contains no wheat and no yeast , so it might be preferable for people sensitive to those ingredients . Gaia is also slightly less expensive than Floradix , which is important since the bottle only contains enough for 12.5 days . I gave it 4 stars for these reasons , which to me indicate a company with integrity . But for me , Floradix gave better results so I 'll be returning to that .	1
My gal occasionally experiences anemia and low energy levels . Iron is important in hemoglobin , the oxygen carrying protein in red blood cells . She was glad to give this Gaia Herbs PlantForce Liquid Iron a try.Likes : *Good tasting , easy to swallow liquid that 's flavored with organic honey and other fruit juices/extracts . *Each 10ml dose ( twice daily ) provides 10mg of Iron ( Ferrous Gluconate ) : 56 % of Daily Value for adults . *Includes a convenient plastic measuring cup with indicator lines at 10 and 20ml . *Additional organic herb ingredients : Elderberry fruit juice concentrate , Proprietary Extract Blend , Beet root juice , Nettle leaf , etc.Slight dislikes : *Requires refrigeration after opening . *Glass bottle is heavier and requires more careful handling.Bottom Line : A good alternative/liquid form of iron supplement that 's easier to take than tablets .	1
Iron supplements do n't taste good ( ask any kid chewing a Flintstone vitamin ) , and some other reviewers mentioned that the flavor of this Gaia supplement was unpleasant , so I was a little scared to try it . But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the taste is not at all objectionable . Kind of made me think of prune juice . I mean , it 's not a flavor I would go out of my way to have , but I did n't have to choke it down , especially of such a small volume.The recommended dose is 10ml ( 2 teaspoons ) twice a day . This would give you a total of 20mg of iron between the two doses . That 's not a lot , but unless you are anemic and a doctor has told you that you need more , it 's plenty . And seriously , do n't mess around with any iron supplement and take extra just because you feel tired or your friend said that extra iron gave her energy . If you are not iron deficient ( ask your doctor to test your ferritin ) , do n't take more than the recommended dose ! I used to be severely anemic , and I struggled to take enough iron because of the side effects , so I figured this stuff would be right up my alley . Unfortunately , it was `` out of mind , out of sight , '' and I kept forgetting to take it . Once the bottle is opened , it has to be refrigerated , and it just blended in . Weeks went by , and then I came across it and said , `` Who put plant fertilizer in the refrigerator ? Oh , wait ... '' Then , ironically enough , I just happened to have my annual checkup right after that , and I found that my iron level was the highest it 's ever been , comfortably in the target range . So now my need for this product is not so pressing . And , since you are supposed to toss it out 30 days after opening , and I ca n't remember when the heck I opened it ( but I 'm pretty sure it 's way longer than 30 days ago ) , I guess I should toss it . Do yourself a favor and be sure to write the `` open '' date somewhere on the bottle or box , and put up some reminder so you do n't forget to take it.Included in the ingredients are elderberry juice , sea buckthorn juice , star anise pod juice , acerola , rice bran , beet root juice , parsley , nettles , dandelion , fennel , and yellow dock . This sounds good , but I 'm allergic to a lot of things , and something in here kind of made the back of my throat feel a little raw ( I 'm guessing it was the elderberry juice , but I do n't know for sure because I 'm not aware of having an allergy specifically to any of these ingredients ) . So if you have food allergies , you might need to use a little caution.To summarize : Pros : *Good flavor*Quality product*None of the typical side-effects of iron supplements*Probably much more bio-available than an iron pill*Comes in a glass bottle ( no worries about leached chemicals ) *Has a handy dose cup ( with markings for 10ml and 20ml ) Cons : *Expensive ( the 8.5-ounce bottle is about two-weeks ' worth , so it 's more than $ 1 per day ) *Not as convenient as a pill*Easy to forget about*Short shelf life*Bring your reading glasses : the label has ridiculously small type*The multiple juices used in the mix might pose an allergy issue for some people	1
30 day supply . I mix it with my morning smoothie - good to go ! And again early afternoon between lunch and dinner again in a smoothie.Remember to Shake well before using , Refrigerate after opening , discard after 30 days if you do n't use it up .	1
Gaia Herbs Liquid Herbal Iron is one way I as well as one of my children can get their daily dose of iron organically and in liquid form if preferred . Though the flavor of this product is bearable of honey and oranges it 's not my favorite . It still taste of iron ! I 've had issues in the past taking iron pills that were n't gel coated and usually once in awhile , they came right back out . The plus side is though since I 've taken this iron supplement , I 've not had headaches which commonly happens when I take the recommended dose for adults in pill format . Just make sure you take it during or after a meal or it can cause you to be a bit queasy ! I 've been able to keep this liquid iron down without any issue , thankfully.My props to this being even safe enough for woman that are pregnant and breastfeeding . Though before doing so , I would recommend checking if it 's okay with your doctor first . I find that the price is a bit high but I do n't think you 'll find another more affordable that is vegetarian , made with with organic ingredients , nut free , gluten free and alcohol free . A nice benefit it that the bottle comes with a dosage cup so need to track one down . You must refrigerate it after opening and use up before 30 days or you 'll have to throw away any remaining amount . Overall I believe the the product is working , I do n't feel as tired as usual just not a real fan of the flavor .	1
I get anemic & very low energy during a certain time of the month ; ) I was taking Floradix until I noticed it contained wheat , which I can not have . The Gaia one was on sale at my health food store so I decided to try it . It has the same type & amount of iron as Floradix but it also has a bunch of good stuff in it - veggie & herb . Floradix now has a GF version but I think I 'll stick with the Gaia because of the added goodies . The Gaia also tastes a little better . But honestly , no iron tastes *good* . But it 's medicine & I 'd be kinda wary of medicine that tastes too good lol.I start taking this a day or 2 before `` it '' starts and continue taking it through the last day . For me , I can get 2 full cycles out of one bottle . That 's a little longer than their toss-after-30-days recommendation but I 've had no problems at all , and this stuff is way too expensive to toss ! I also sometimes forget to take it twice a day so often do the daily 20ml dose in one go and it 's never been a problem for me . * ( SEE UPDATE BELOW ) Important note : there are certain things that inhibit absorption of iron - apparently caffeine and calcium ( so dairy ) . I also just read that dietary fiber , polyphenols ( in wine , fruit & veg ) & phytates ( found in grains , legumes , nuts ) also inhibit absorption . Geez that 's a super prohibitve list ! ! I 'm planning to contact Gaia and see what are the real offenders & how much time to space between iron & these foods . Because if you follow the instructions of within 30 mins before meal AND away from all these foods you 'd never take it ! I 'll update my review once I find out the answer : ) In the meantime , I try to take it before a meal not containing caffeine or too much dairy.UPDATE ! ! So I reached out to Gaia as well as Floradix to find out how much time to allow between taking iron and foods , supplements , etc that may hinder absorption . They both responded with basically the same info , but Gaia 's rep sent a very thorough monograph waaay to long to post here which is why I 'm posting Floradix 's shorter response ... '' Floradix/Floravital is best taken about 15-30 minutes before meals . This way it is quickly absorbed on an empty stomach with food to follow to stimulate digestion and ensure the iron is tolerated . It 's best to avoid drinking coffee , tea , or wine with or within the hour of Floradix as tannins in these liquids can interfere with iron absorption . It would also be best to not take calcium and magnesium supplements , vitamin E or multivitamins generally along with Floradix as these could also interfere with optimal iron absorption . Medications should be taken 2 hours apart from Floradix as well , as certain ones , like antibiotics and thyroid medications can interfere with iron absorption too . `` The Gaia and Floradix reps also agreed that for best absorption and to minimize nausea , take the iron on an empty stomach 15-30 mins before a meal . They also both felt that taking both doses ( 2 10ml doses ) at once like I 'd been doing may not be effective - meaning , you may not be able to absorb this much at once & even though I 'm not experiencing problems now I may later . They recommended taking 10ml 2x/day or taking 15ml at the most in one dose.Hopes this helps : )	1
First , the taste was a little tough . It was a little hard for me to get used to and certainly not something that I would enjoy . Second , be careful having this in a home with little kids . The bottle is easy to open and Iron is a leading cause of poisoning.But If you can take it , this stuff is fabulous . It is amazing that there are so many & # 34 ; energy drinks & # 34 ; full of garbage that does nothing good . People spend fortunes on those and coffee . Maybe this is what you really need . I felt noticeably better from the first day . You might want to build up slowly as this will slow your bowels down . But I love this . I have been really fatigued and it is amazing to feel better .	1
Gaia somehow makes this both palatable and effective yet without the stomach upset/constipation or added but totally unnecessary ingredients found in similar ( albeit far ) inferior . Spouse had been hospitalized last year and became anemic - this is a gentle but high quality iron supplement . Glass bottle is a big plus as is the decent taste and lack of constipation which is a major problem with many iron supplements.Organic and vegetarian are also preferred as is the addition of vitamin C to assist in absorption . Overall , very pleased with this product and the brand .	1
This is basically a plant-derived concentrated juice that happens to have a lot of iron in it . And some honey ( so it 's not exactly vegan-friendly ) . It tastes ... well , a little strong . Not terrible , but the & # 34 ; great taste ! & # 34 ; claim on the label is something of a stretch . Having not tried other iron supplements , it might be better than alternatives.One 8.5 oz . bottle contains 25 10mL servings , which adults are directed to take twice daily . So a bottle lasts less than two weeks.Oh yeah , cost . If you were to take this every day as directed , it would cost over five hundred bucks a year . The stuff ai n't cheap.If you have the money , and need iron ( note : most men definitely do not ) , this seems like a reasonable way to get it .	1
This seems like a very good way to get your iron . The taste is like orange flavored prunes mixed with biting the inside of your mouth ( except without any pain . ) This is a little anecdotal ( I guess that 's sort of the nature of these types of reviews ) but the first day I took this I was riding my bike for a little over an hour , then had an appointment for an hour and then was riding an hour+ back again . I have n't been riding regularly lately ( tsk ! ) so in this case and with my route being somewhat hilly , I expected to find the ride back somewhat of a struggle . Imagine my surprise when the ride back was actually easy and a pleasure ! Hills and all . I did n't really do anything different except take the iron , and from what I 've read if you 're suffering from fatigue related to iron deficiency it will probably take a few weeks of supplementation to notice a difference , but I felt so great . I did once get turned away from donating blood because I was & # 34 ; borderline anemic & # 34 ; , so I really feel like this iron made a difference for me.My main problem with this is that it has to be refrigerated and ... um ... out of sight out of mind . So many times I forget to take it just because it 's not there reminding me .	1
If you battle with anemia and low energy and other iron supplements give you side effects , this may be right for you.Gaia Herbs Plantforce Liquid Iron is a a pleasant tasting , convenient way to incorporate extra iron in your diet . Taken as directed for maximum absorption , this supplement can be a beneficial addition to your diet . It did not make me nauseous or constipated like some other high-potency iron supplements have . I also trust the Gaia name since I 've been taking their other supplements for years.As always , get regular checkups with your primary healthcare physician to understand your iron levels and nutritional needs . If you need extra iron then this is a good choice .	1
I would take a shot of this in the morning and another towards the end of the day . This is an efficient way to get your iron intake quickly since liquid travels through your blood stream quicker than a pill . There is n't much of a noticeable difference as far as energy expansion goes . I would notice a slight awakening of my mind minutes after taking this . Any feelings of lethargy are lifted slightly . It 's not an energy jolt you get from caffeine , more of a mind opening one . Everybody 's body chemistry is different so you 'll have to asses this for yourself . The one negative is the bottle does n't last very long . You 're done with it before the month is up . Regardless the bottle clearly says to toss the bottle if its been more than a month anyway . There are not preservatives in this so it 's not going to last for months sitting in your fridge .	1
This comes in a bottle with a convenient dosing cup . You take it twice a day , just a bit , so it is not ever a lot to drink at once . The first time I tasted it , it was warm and I really tasted the iron , but the flavor itself was n't bad . Just iron does n't taste that good . I 've had that iron water and it is a LOT worse . With this , it is super concentrated fruits and organic honey , so that 's the notes you get ON TOP OF the iron flavor . When cold the iron taste is less noticable and it 's actually a decent taste for a medicine.I feel a surge of energy not 30 minutes after taking it , so there 's more in it than the iron ! It 's the fruit and sugars in the honey I think . I like it though - I find myself looking forward to taking it before I have to prepare a meal . I 've not been diagnosed with low iron , but I do have unmedicated restless leg syndrome that acts up when my iron is even a tad low , and it has been.I learned in nutrition class that vitamin C helps iron absorb , so it makes sense to me that the concentrated fruit and veggy in this will help the process.I 've had absolutely NO stomach problems at all taking this . No burps , stomach pains , or constipation . The poop is darker but that 's normal with any iron I 've ever had . It 's quite pleasant for an iron supplement . I like it a lot better than the iron water and the iron pills I 've taken in the past . It 's easier on my digestive system , has that nice pleasant immediate boost , and it tastes pretty good .	1
If you suffer from anemia or low iron , give this product a try . I was taking a dr. prescribed iron supplement , but it made me feel awful and it was constipating . After two weeks using this , I really noticed the difference . The taste is okay , I prefer using it in a morning smoothie and do n't notice the taste at all then . Since this is not filled with artifical preservatives , it should be used up or discarded after a month . However , that 's not a problem with daily use . Really preferable to the pills the dr. had me on .	1
This is a great iron supplement . I had no issues with digestion or the taste and am pleased with the line-up of quality ingredients . It 's well worth the price if you 're needing additional iron in your diet and is something I would definitely order again . All in all an excellent product !	1
I think this is a very good product . However , I 'm not crazy about the price - seems a bit expensive . But , I think this form of minerals , herbs and iron is good choice for those who are vegetarians , or who have trouble swallowing pills.At first I thought it was going to be like my mother 's `` Geritol '' brand of iron from way back and I anticipated it tasting the same , but I was very pleasantly surprised at the lightness of flavor and texture . It 's not all thick and gooey , but medium/light it liquidity and very easy to swallow . The flavor was nothing like Geritol and I thought it tasted pretty good . I do n't mind that it needs to be refrigerated because it tells me there are no artificial preservatives in it . It needs to be discarded after 30 days but that will only make me remember to take it each day as directed.I do n't necessarily need the extra iron anymore since I 've gone through the `` change '' ( menopause ) , but those who have n't need all the extra iron they can get . And it says it 's appropriate for pregnant and breast-feeding women . Overall , I like the Gaia Herbs Liquid a lot and the glass bottle is recyclable , but I 'll probably keep it and put a cork in it after it 's empty since it 's so cool looking !	1
I 've had iron deficiencies off and on my whole life . The problem is that iron supplements bring my inner workings to a halt -- I do n't want to be gruesome , but just know that they usually make things less than regular . So when I tried this one , I was a little worried and paid close attention . Well , no problems . That 's all you need to know about that.This tastes kinda nasty ... I guess that is n't fair , it is n't so bad that I wo n't take it . It is slightly sweet with kind of an eh notsomuch aftertaste . It is doable . And I 'm happy to take a little of the bad taste over all daily operations going on strike .	1
This is my new go-to liquid iron supplement ! Way better tasting than the one I was previously taking and it does n't start tasting funny after it 's been in the fridge for a week like my old one did.I love that it contains mostly organic ingredients . It also contains Acerola fruit extract as a natural vitamin c to help aid in absorption.This is a product I can truly feel the difference when I take !	1
i was expecting this to taste mineral-y , but was so surprised to taste a sweet , honeyed finish with a slight essence of prune juice ( or very concentrated plums ) . It 's naturally flavored , and goes down a lot easier than swallowing non-tasty pills . Plant-based iron is another bonus , vs. animal-based like some supplements .	1
This is not , `` certified gluten-free , '' meaning it has not been tested for gluten-freeness . However , this is actually gluten-free.I 'm celiac and I 've been testing it for the last several days , with no ill effects . It tastes good , too .	1
When I donated blood last time I was told my iron was on the low side , and this was conformed from another blood test from my doctor . I am not entirely sure how my iron got low , but this product will help me slowly get my iron levels back up to where they should be . I have no doubt that this is a great product and has great absorption , but the taste is n't for me . I know others have stated the taste is good , but I really can not agree with that . It reminds me of another iron product I have tried , which I have to admit was even worse tasting than this one , but is similar enough that it reminds me of that really awful tasting product .	1
I am always low on energy , every single day , so I am always trying supplements , vitamins , etc ... to get that extra boost to get through the day . Most of them dont work very well . I used this every day for a few weeks and I can say that the product was easy to get down and that I seemed to have a little more energy than I have in a long time.Do n't know for sure if this was the helpful trigger but it helped me so thumbs up !	1
As I get older , I tend to favor non-pill options for my supplement needs . I already take several pills and liquid supplements are nice because they can usually be thrown in smoothies , teas , soups , or just consumed straight off a spoon without the vitamin smell and with the benefit of quick absorption . I like the Gaia Herbs liquid because it is easy to take and does n't taste terrible . It is n't delicious by any stretch , but I did n't risk throwing up each time I took it.Several things that I do not like ( that accompany most liquid supplements ) : Refrigeration : I did not like were that the product has to be refrigerated ( most liquid supplements do ) so it takes up space.Serving Size : There are n't that many servings in a bottle , which could make this a more costly supplement option for some.Short shelf-life : A third potential con is that the supplement is supposed to be exhausted within 30 days after opening , so if you are something that takes supplements only when you need them or are on a schedule that differs than everyday , a product with a very short shelf-life after opening may not be your thing.Not very portable : If you are going on vacation or a trip , you probably will not want to lug a bottle with you.For me , the cons are not huge . I have a big fridge , I rarely go on trips , and I take my vitamins regularly so short shelf-life is n't a huge issue . However , for some people , these concerns would be valid .	1
Tastes great : think of flowers , pear , pom juice and herbal tea . Does not leave my teeth yellow , Has incredible ingredients , and it is one of very few iron supplements I can take without feeling awful .	1
My wife has been taking Gaia Herbs liquid iron and seems to be doing well on it . She says the taste is pretty good but knowing her she 'd drink road tar if it was healthy . Most of the month her iron levels are good but for about a week every four weeks she gets terribly tired . Gaia iron seems to help with the fatigue and moods . Since being a man I have no need for this product so I have no first hand proof it works except to say her energy level during her off times has been much improved.Highly recommended	1
My doctor put me on an iron supplement and this is the best one I have tried . It tastes good and gives me energy . It 's easily and quickly absorbed .	1
My wife takes this regularly for maybe about 2 weeks and love the fact that she is putting enough iron into her system as she is slightly anemic . A big plus was that it is also organic so it is really good for the body.Unfortunately , 8.5 ounce with 2 teaspoons daily does n't last very long.It 's a great product save for the price of it .	1
I took this while on a juice cleanse . It tastes gross , however , since it is sweet , holding my nose while taking it is really easy . I just drink something right after . I 've read other people say it tastes a lot better than other iron supplements and I do n't even want to imagine how awful those taste . I felt good while taking this and would recommend it to people . I personally will buy it again when I juice since the bottle needs to be thrown away after 30 days .	1
I ordered this liquid iron supplement for wife to try and I also tried it too . My wife has low iron level in her system and sometimes requires a little supplement to help her feel better . This supplement has a less metallic taste than some of the product in the market but also contains less concentration of iron . If you have a moderate or sever case of iron deficiency this may not be enough for you .	1
My only negative for this product is that I found the taste unpleasant . This was n't just my reaction . I have a step-daughter who is borderline anemic and we hoped she would take this . Absolutely a no-go . I tried it as well and immediately understood why she did n't like it . Perhaps this could be mixed in a smoothie or something else ? We plan to try that.Otherwise this appears to be an excellent product . One of the concerns with iron supplements is constipation . That has n't been an issue . Combine that with the ingredients I 'd say this was worth getting .	1
The term `` superfood '' usually makes me grit my teeth a bit , because often it 's a marketing ploy to relieve hopeful consumers of their hard earned dollars . There are some fruits and vegetables that , far from being magic elixirs with magical powers , do have benefits and contain properties that have a positive effect in nourishing and maintain our wellbeing , outside of the narrow choices that make up most of our staples . With an open mind , I decided to give Maca a try after seeing several friends adopting it into their daily routine . I was n't aware that Maca is a taproot plant that grows in the highlands of Peru and is related to the radish and the turnip . It 's been used for centuries as a vegetable root , medicinally and purportedly as an aphrodisiac . It 's said to be rich in calcium and potassium as well as a host of essential trace elements and minerals like copper , iron zinc and manganese . In terms of using it in powdered form , the two incarnations are either raw or gelatinized . That second term seemed confusing , but evidently the gelatinized route refers to the root being cooked under pressure to remove the starch which concentrates the nutrients . Which form is better ? Several online resources presented research that the gelatinized process does sacrifice some of the root 's natural enzymes and something called glucosinolates , both of which offer their own benefits though glucosinolates are said to be toxic in high amounts but beneficial and even cancer mitigators in smaller quantities . The advantage of the cooked variety , which this product is , is that with the starch stripped out it becomes more nutrient dense and is much more easily digestible . Animals fed this denser type produced young with higher birth weights and seemed healthier . Most sources advise easing the quantity used , starting as low as half a teaspoon and working your way up by experimentation as to what works best in your individual system . One interesting claim is that a major benefit of Maca is that it seems to help regulate and balance our hormones , relieving some unpleasant effects in unbalanced systems , as in the hot flashes suffered by menopausal women . The powder dissolves very easily in water . The taste is not unpleasant , but is distinct and so I chose not to include it in my smoothies , whose taste I thoroughly enjoy and did n't want to alter . I started using a teaspoon but worked up to a tablespoon . Did I see any noticeable difference in regard to the claims of increased stamina and energy ? If so it was not extremely pronounced in me . I did detect a noticeable difference in libido . Is this a worthwhile product ? From my preliminary experience of using it only a few weeks I definitely believe it is and I will continue to make it part of my daily routine.UPDATE : 18July2014 - I 've been using this for a month now and can honestly say that I notice a pronounced effect in both energy and a feeling of wellbeing . To be more specific , I 've experimented with making a daily drink mixing this Maca with Moringa powder and Spirulina and a few other similar ingredients ; so I ca n't attribute all the positive results to the maca alone . But I am extremely impressed and have already reordered , planning to make it a staple in my daily routine .	1
I 've used two other brands of maca powder ( HealthWorks-Wild Organic Peruvian Maca Root Powder Wildcrafted Raw Superfood 1 Lband one by Synchro Nutritionals that Amazon no longer seems to carry ) before I had the chance to try out this one by Gaia . While I liked those other two , both came in Ziploc-type pouches that made using the powder messy and inconvenient . The tube that the Gaia powder comes in makes it much easier to use.If I use this on a regular basis ( one teaspoon a day ) , I find that it really does help with my energy , mood , and libido . I had stopped using it a few months ago , but noticed a difference after about a week of adding this back into my diet . ( One day , I realized that I had more energy than I had had , and , when I stopped to think about it , realized that I had started using maca powder again . ) I usually mix it into either my morning oatmeal ( along with chia seeds , protein powder , some fruit , and hemp seeds ) or into my green smoothie . It has a mild , mellow taste , and blends in well with whatever you put it in.As my review title mentions , just be careful about using this too late in the afternoon if you have trouble with insomnia . Since it does rev you up a bit , I 've found that I need to take this by 2:00 or I have trouble sleeping . For that reason , having a teaspoon in my morning oatmeal works best.To your health ! : - )	1
I prefer the Maca Powder to the capsules . Although less convenient or easy travelling , I like to see what I blending into smoothies etc . I did notice increased & # 34 ; friskiness & # 34 ; not quite a la cavewoman on the hunt though . This is an improvement compared to the capsules for me .	1
I 've been taking Maca for about a year and a half . This particular preparation is very high quality . Most maca can have a very strong , earthy , rooty taste that takes alot of getting used to . This Gaia preparation is much more pleasant . Great job and recommended .	1
OK , I have n't been taking it long enough to be sure about the hairy chest , but I have been taking it long enough to be sure that just a scant 1/2 teaspoon gets my energy up -- and it stays there throughout the day . Wow -- no more energy drinks for me . That little bit mixed in water really does the trick for me.I may experiment with increasing the dose , but because it works so well at such a small dose , I may not bother -- it 's a success in my opinion , just as little of a dose as it is.FIVE STARS !	1
I 've heard a lot about Maca and was interested to try this . It 's hard to say much about the health claims since it 's totally anecdotal and not a controlled or blinded study ... That said , the product appears to be of high quality . The container is a neat , biodegradable non-plastic , and the consistency of the product itself is excellent . It mixes well in water and is actually not an unpleasant taste . This appears to be a very good version of Maca to try and I will update after a few weeks of trying it daily .	1
Seems to be a very good maca , and more economical than pills.You can take any amount , so measure carefully.This is said to be adaptogenic for adrenals , but I am in severe adrenal fatigue and was n't feeling benefit from it . Apparently YMMV.Will wait until the adrenals are supported then try again maybe.If maca is benefiting you , then I 'd recommend this one .	1
I 've been taking Maca Powder for awhile now with good results . I take it for a week or so , in smoothies or my morning cereal and then take a break . It has a mild flavor that is easy to get used to . It 's been good to use as I go through menopause , as it is supposed to help balance your hormones . You should NOT take it if you 're pregnant or nursing.It 's purported to be helpful with stress , and good for general health . I 've used another brand for years and this was very comparable , seems to be just as good and is recommended .	1
We use this with smoothies as part of our weekly cleanse . Vital to use additional supplements when u cleanse as ur body still needs the nutrients . The cleanse is for the digestive track ... and this product , for me , keeps the energy level even , and no sudden drop . Gaia products are always quality for us . Recommend .	1
I just recently bought this product about 3 weeks and I do not see much difference than my normal energy levels , but I have to say that it has increased my libido . I have noticed the difference and I will keep using it .	1
I eat a high vegetable Paleo diet , getting most of my veggies from smoothies . This powdered form of Maca blends well , and has a very noticeable taste . Somethings it taste better with than others , but for the most part , I like it in my smoothies.I ca n't say that there 's a & # 34 ; OH , I can FEEL that & # 34 ; effect , but I do notice I average higher on the curve when I add it regularly.I use about a teaspoon , so this container goes a long way . Making it a good value for the roughly twenty dollars .	1
As a chef , I can say I 've gone through more kitchen scales then I can relay ... then I got the MIRA kitchen scale and , not only has it lasted for years , it has been the most accurate . And I use it all day long.So , trying out the body scale was done with high expectations . And they were met.Unlike most scales , it has a handle as well so you can keep it tucked away and then easily grab it to use as needed.The readout is large and bright so even if you have your contacts out , you can see.It has been very accurate -- matched my doctor 's scale perfectly as well.Scale provided by MIRA	1
My first impression upon taking it out of the box was how LIGHT the scale is . I mean , it 's UBER light . That , of course , made me worry that it would n't be able to standup to general wear and tear that happens in a house with two small children and two nutty dogs ! So far , I 've been proved wrong.My daughter helped me do the initial tests . We discovered that although the scale does not want to pick up very small amounts of weight , like her stuff small horse , it does in fact take measurements of normal people ! : ) It took the same reading for her several times and then did a normal fluctuation throughout the day but stayed basically around her weight.Although it made a crunch sound when my son stepped on the handle part ( why he decided to step on that part I 'm not entirely sure ) , but after checking everything seemed in order- there was n't a crack to be seen . That proves it has durability against a 5 year old that weighs 67 pounds ! I love the light up display and the fact that I can see it without my glasses ! This is a great product that is n't too heavy to move anywhere in the house you could want it . It 's durable against small monsters and everyday wear and tear ! *I received this scale in exchange for an honest review*	1
Right now I 'm not really watching my weight because of the pregnancy . I mean I do n't want to eat like a piggy and gain 20 billion extra pounds , but I go to the doctor often enough for them to keep track of all that these days , making my life a bit easier at the moment . Pre-pregnancy though I was starting to pay attention to my weight because since getting married I 'm starting to carry on that `` content '' weight as I hear it being called . 'Oh you can tell you 're content in your relationship now ' blah blah blah . Well I 'm glad I 'm happy in my relationship , but I hate that automatic weight gain . Of course it could also be the whole getting older thing and sitting around eating junk food does n't agree with my body like it did in high school . Either way , I was in the process of trying to get back in shape then the pregnancy came about so I 'll be back on that task after Jace is born . Well to help me keep track and achieve my goal is the MIRA Digital Body fat scale ( which is only $ 44.99 on Amazon right now ! ) I received a MIRA Digital Body fat scale to check out for myself and I have to say what first caught my eye was the appearance of it . I love the design and feel of the scale - it 's so modern and easy to use . The scale allows me to set my own height and such , but I can also weigh in based on pounds or kilograms . Once I do that I 'm able to set up a profile so to speak where I can enter in my height and gender and such then when I weigh in I can find out if I 'm underweight , overweight , healthy , etc . I love having these options available ! The reason is , I may think I 'm looking a bit over weight , but realistically , I 'm at a healthy weight for my size , but I just do n't feel it after being underweight for so long . So many people struggle with that and do n't know where they stand as far as being at a healthy weight goes and this scale helps achieve that.At the end of the day I 'm very pleased with the scale . It 's cool looking to say the least , thin design - so it 's easy to store away if necessary , easy to read and works great ! I never thought I could enjoy a personal weight scale so much , but I honestly do . Whether you want one to help you achieve your goals or to make sure you 're maintaining your current weight - the MIRA digital scale is definitely a great option to go with . You wo n't be disappointed ! Just check out other reviews on them ! READ FULL REVIEW : [ ... ]	1
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and features of this scale . With up to 8 users possible ; each with different age , height , etc ... entered in , and the availability of an 'athlete ' mode ; seldom found on inexpensive scales of this type , I knew if this scale performed accurately , it would be a great buy . The good news - it does and it is ! This scale has sleek contemporary styling with a digital readout that 's easy to see when you 're standing on the scale . It has a capacity of up to 400 pounds , which is relatively high , even for digital scales . The weight readings and body fat analysis on this scale echos that of my other two scales , leading me to believe it 's also accurate . **Note that your body fat readings will vary based upon your hydration , the time of day , whether you 've just exercised or showered , and several other factors . It 's a good idea to take that reading in the same way each time to get accurate readings ! The athlete mode is a very cool feature that 's not really played up or mentioned . This allows for people who are lean and athletic to get a more accurate reading of their body fat and lean muscle . I have a scale I paid a lot more for with this feature , and I like this one a lot better.You can measure in kilograms or pounds on this scale , and simply stepping on the scale gets things started . The scale takes ( 3 ) AAA batteries , and will automatically ( once you 've setup your user profiles ) recognize each individual user when they step on the scale . The tempered glass scale top is good looking , easy to clean and well made.Overall , I really like this scale . It stores easily , looks good and is feature-rich at the right price . Anyone looking for a way to track their weight loss , fat loss , and muscle gain - will appreciate this well priced item.NOTE : I received this product from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest review .	1
I am really glad that I had the opportunity to try out this scale . I received it as a review item and it has been a great tool to use as I monitor my weight . It is nice to see my body fat percentage shrink - it has helped me to be less discouraged when the number of pounds are not diminishing as quickly as I would like . It is also amazing to me how much my body water fluctuates ! It is also quite accurate . We tested it several ways ( such as adding hand weights to see if the lbs increased accordingly ) and were satisfied with the results.My athletic teenaged sons are also tracking their fitness with this scale .	1
I have been working on dropping a few pounds and getting back into shape . I started my journey in February , but after a few weeks with little to no results , I got frustrated and quit . It did n't take long for me to get back up on the horse though and now I am fully determined . I 've had to learn a few things about myself for my journey to get results . Part of this journey is weighing myself weekly . The weekly weigh in can be stressful and dreaded . luckily , I came across a scale that really has made a huge impact ! I love my MIRA body fat scale . It 's sleek and designed very well . I love that it matches my decor in the bathroom and that it 's thin so it can be stored easily . I do n't have to worry about waking the hubby up when I complete my morning weigh in because the backlight provides enough light to read the results easily , but not enough to wake anyone up .	1
This scale has style , but marries that to technology . It looks very sleek and flat , with a glass look that adds shine to its blue color . It 's low to the ground , so it stays out of the way . The display looks a little garish , but is easy to read even looking down without my glasses on . All in all , the scale is one of the nicest looking that I have seen.The technology also works well . You can enter in profiles for 8 people , inputting things like age , height , gender , and whether you are an athlete or not . The scale then calculates your weight , and outputs both it and whether you are underweight , healthy , overweight or obese . ( Luckily , we all weighed in as healthy . ) If you step on the scale in bare feet , the scale also adds four other measurements : body fat ( % ) , body water ( % ) , muscle mass ( % ) , and bone mass . It calculates those measurements by sending a small current through your body and measuring the resistance . That 's not going to give very accurate results , and they warn you to use those numbers just to track trends rather than relying on them as facts.The scale comes with a written user guide , which is well-written for the most part , but does have a few English errors . The scale also seems not to function quite correctly . It is supposed to be able to track users by their profile , so that you can just step on the scale and it will find which profile belongs to you . A couple of times that did not work right . Plus it can be hard to use the scale without the user guide in hand.Its few minor drawbacks do not really tip the balance away from calling this scale a good one .	1
As a scale - this is flat tempered glass , easy to clean , with an easy to read output . Weigh yourself in your bear feet in your underwear ( or naked ) for accuracy . Besides your weight , it will give you a simplistic analysis of whether you are overweight based on you gender , your age , your height , and your weight . It assumes an average body type and makes no allowance for variations in bone structure , etc . It told me that I am at a healthy body weight , but I personally would like to lose a bit.Follow the instructions to set the scale and to enter your personal parameters . When you weigh yourself , following the instructions , the numbers will repeat three times so that you can step off and kneel down to read them closer ( the fine print is a bit fine when it indicates whether or not you are obese using a small symbol ) .The scale may give you more information than you want ( definitely too much information for every time you weigh yourself ) . If will store profiles for up to 8 people .	1
So easy to set up and use ! There is a LOT of information that this scale can give you -- just by stepping onto it and standing still for a few seconds . I would have thought that the directions/instructions for use would have been complicated . But , no ; it 's quite easy . And it can be set up for eight people.It is beautiful scale , too : Low profile , svelte design , nice looking dark glass , bright easy-to-read numbers ( even with so much info crammed on the screen at one time ) .It has four feet with rubber grippers that keep the scale top surface only an inch from the floor . Sweet ! This is the nicest scale I 've ever had . *I received a sample product from MIRA Brands .	1
Beautifully designed , this scale does what it says it will do . I was offered the opportunity to try one of these out , and I 'm glad I agreed . I was able to check its accuracy by taking it along to my doctor 's office on a visit last week , and it was spot on . Based on results of tests performed for recent medical issues , I can verify that the other readings ( body fat % , muscle % , etc . ) seem to be accurate as well . Programming my information into the scale was easy , and took only a minute or so . It turns on when you step on it , so there 's no fumbling for buttons.The only problem I had with this was it is VERY sensitive to motion , so if you 're the least bit unsteady , it may take several tries to get your results . I have some balance issues , so it was a bit tricky . If you can stand still , without any shifting of weight from foot to foot or front to back , you 'll be just fine , but it 's something to think about . It 's NOT enough to deduct a star -- just tells me that this is a good quality device with high sensitivity , and I 'm figuring out what I need to do to get a reading.I was quite impressed with this scale -- it seems to have everything , is programmable for multiple users , and gives quite a lot of information . Plus , it 's very nice looking -- slick glass , very & # 34 ; flat. & # 34 ; Definitely looks pricier than it is .	1
The nice thing about this body fat scale is not only will it store up to 9 profiles in its memory , I do n't have to enter myself when I weigh myself . It just knows who I am after the initial set up.The readings are very easy to see , day or night , and I do n't have to squint to see whether I 'm looking at fat , bone , water , or muscle.Is it accurate ? Hard to say . The weight is close to within half a pound to my other body fat scale . It says I have 8.8 pounds of bone versus 5.9 pounds of bone . I do n't know which to believe , but they are both precise in that I can replicate the measurements . Precision is key , because it 's really the readings I get over time that are important to me . Am I losing weight ? Am I losing bone ? It 's a good scale , very attractive and easy to use.This product was provided for review by MIRA brands .	1
This is the first scale that I 've used that will measure more than just bodyweight . This one will measure % Body Fat , % Total Body Water , % Muscle Mass and Bone Mass along with your weight . And it will keep the profiles of up to 8 people , so each family member can keep track of their own progress . Once you initially input your information such as age , gender and height , you just set it to your profile number before you step on and it `` remembers '' you . In our case , because my husband is a lot taller and weighs more than me , it seems to know which of us is stepping on the scale without pushing the button to move from one user to the other . It uses a weak electrical current that you do n't even feel or notice , to calculate your water or fat or muscle . It even tells you if you are within your acceptable body weight , underweight , or overweight . For measurements other than weight , you need to stand barefoot on the scale . For some reason socks seem to mess up the other measurements.I had to look up average fat and water weights and things like bone mass to see what an average range would be . I like the idea of being able to be aware my percentage of water weight since , for women , this seems to sometimes very quite a lot . Sushi the day before with all that soy sauce ? Boom ! An extra 2 or 3 pounds ! But at least now I know when it 's likely to be retained water rather than stored fat . My weight seems accurate on this scale and although I 'm not sure about the other measurements , they at least seem to be consistent and in line with what I 've read about averages for a person of my weight and height.The scale is very smart looking with a glass finish that is simple to keep clean . It can be set for pounds or kilograms and has a backlit display that 's just large enough for me to read without putting in my contact lenses.I received a review sample of this scale .	1
What first came to mind when I sat and leaned against the Fellowes 9311601 I-Spire Series Lumbar Cushion was the three bears . And Goldilocks said that it was `` just right '' . This lumbar cushion is just that - just right - firm yet giving . You want support but not feel you are supported by either a bean bag or a cement pillar . The support I feel is like I said firm yet giving.So far as the construction of the cushion , well it appears to be well made . However only use over time will tell how it will hold up . If it falls apart in 6 months I 'll come back and edit this review . But for now I take the leap of faith and give this lumbar cushion 5 stars . Excellent !	1
I do n't have the best posture in the world -- and that , combined with work that keeps me sitting at a computer for long periods at time puts a major strain on my back . The Fellowes I-Spire Series Lumbar Cushion is just the item I 've been looking for to relieve some of that lower back tension.It easily adjusts to various chairs with a seat belt-style strap that holds the cushion securely in the desired position . The firm foam cushion is a breathable mesh fabric , and , best of all , it reminds me to sit up straighter and eases that chronic stiffness when I stand up after prolonged periods in front of the monitor.I 'm actually using it right now and am sitting a little taller because of it .	1
I use lumbar pillows everywhere , and at my office , I have a cylinder-shaped pillow and I always have to lift up and place in the right place each time I sit down . It will fall and roll away frequently.. I 've seen this type of pillow before , but since the chair is plastic on the back and a strange shape , I did n't think it would stay put.This pillow has a strap that feels like seatbelt material , which is a good choice for this application . I 've seen other pillows with an elastic strap , which does n't allow a tight , long-term fit . This also has a buckle , which allows it to be used in places that a elastic strap may not go . On my office chair , it stays put.The pillow is rather hard , so after a whole day , it may be uncomfortable . I 've gotten used to it . If you are used to soft lumbar pillows , this will probably not be for you .	1
I sit in my home office chair for a good portion of the day , and it has taken a toll on my lower back . Although my executive chair has lumbar support , the length of my thighs is not enough for my back to rest firmly against the back , so that 's where this cushion comes in . It sticks out roughly 2 '' from the back of my chair ; the adjustable strap allows me to position it right where I need it . I almost thought I would have to throw it away , however , because I had to struggle to get the strap clasped , even at its most extended , because of the width of my chair back . The maximum the strap can extend is about 53 '' . If your chair measures greater than that around at the spot where you 'd place the cushion , look at another option.Once in place , this lumbar cushion does its job well by nestling in the small of my back . I find that a foot rest under my desk helps , too , to alleviate some of the pressure put on my lower back . When I combine the two , I 'm more comfortable and for longer stretches of time. -- Debble Lee Wesselmann	1
I often have lower back pain and stiffness , so I was glad to try the cushion . At first , it felt too thick , but after sitting for some time , I was surprised to not have any stiffness getting up . I tried the cushion at different places around my house , it worked very well for my office chair , and for outdoor chairs ; on the dining chair it slides down because of the latch position prevents it from locking.There is a zipper closure and you can remove the foam core and clean the outside of the cushion .	1
I use this lumbar cushion on my office chair to provide the lumbar support I need throughout long days at the office . The level of support is good , and even after weeks of use , I have n't noticed the firmness decreasing or becoming misshapen . My only complaint is that the support only has one band that ties around the chair , which makes it prone to slipping down into a position that is too low . Even though I keep the strap as tight as possible , I find I have to readjust it pretty often . I think two straps would probably be more secure than just one .	1
I am a sloucher by nature , spending a lot of time in my reclining chair in front of my projector.Eventually , my lower back will start hurting and that 's where the lumbar support comes in handy.My reclining chair is too large to attach the lumbar support to it so I am attaching instead around my own body and it stays in place quite well.Of course , one can attach it the normal way to a chair .	1
After having had seven surgeries to rebuild my lower spine , I understand very well the need for correct posture to maintain the proper alignment of the spine . I have lumbar cushions of various types on every chair in our house that I use , and one of the deciding factors in buying my last two cars was the lumbar adjustment control for the driver 's seat . So I was very interested in trying the Fellowes lumbar cushion.It 's a nice cushion . It 's about two inches thick , and the foam inside is firm enough that it does n't crush too much when you lean back into it . The adjustable strap tightens around the chair back and holds the cushion in place fairly well . One of the chairs I use has back pieces that are slanted , so the cushion tended to slide down , but using a bit of strapping tape ( or duct tape ) kept it from slipping . I think the cushion would be very effective for driving , too . My car has excellent lumbar support for the driver 's seat , but it 's only so-so for the passenger seat . I tried it there while my wife drove during a half-hour drive , and it helped my back considerably , but the movements of the car , and a couple of bumpy roads , made the cushion slip out of position , and I had to pull it up every few minutes . I actually tried strapping the cushion on myself , and it was more secure that way.As compact as the lumbar cushion is , it 's ideal for traveling on a plane or train , and if you rent a car at your destination , use it in the car too . Also , we go to the movies about once a month , and it should work in a theater seat , although I have n't tried that yet.The cushion itself is well made and looks like it should last a long time . The cover has a zipper that allows the foam pad to be removed , so I imagine that you could wash the cover if it gets stained or dirty.It 's definitely worth a try to protect your spine and ward off lower back pain .	1
This is a very good cushion . It provides good lumbar support and fits to most chairs . I gave this product four stars only because the strap is not long enough to fit around many of the chairs in my house . It does fit easily around table chairs and other chairs that do not have wide backs on them . I asked for this lumbar cushion with the idea of putting it in my car for added lumbar support while driving , but found that the strap is not long enough to reach around the seat and latch together . Although , the manner is which I am attempting to use this product may not be in accordance with how it is intended to be utilized . Over all this is a very good lumbar cushion that provides good support in chairs that lack cushioning in the lower region of the back .	1
I 'm always on the lookout for anything that helps with back issues . The Fellowes Lumbar Cushion is n't the first such product I 've used , and as others have said , it 's a low tech solution for lumbar back pain.What it does it forces you to sit correctly in a chair , thus relieving stress on that portion of your back . The Fellowes cushion works as well as any I 've tried , and in some instances , it 's better.The one thing you can see with this is it 's well made . The attached strap to keep the cushion in place worked fine in every place I put it , but I do see where it would n't fit every chair equally well.Some have found it too hard , but for me , it was perfectly comfortable.If you try a lot of different things for back pain relief , this might be your kind of cushion . If you 're very sensitive to firmness in that area , I 'd pass on this .	1
I 've never used any kind of lumbar cushion before , so I did n't know what to expect , but this could n't of come at a better time , as I 've been lifting a lot of heavy things lately , that have left my lower back feeling sore.I have many Fellowes products , and have always found them to work well , as intended , including this lumbar cushion.The colors of this lumbar cushion would work well in pretty much any office environment , as the colors are fairly neutral , black and gray.The cushion part is not too wide , too small , or too narrow . It 's firm but not hard . It does have a mesh design . The strap with the attached buckle is long enough , so that you could attach it to many different kinds of chairs as needed.Just place the lumbar cushion on to the chair you want to use it on , then wrap each end of the strap around to the back of the chair , and click the two ends in . It 's that simple . I made sure that the lumbar cushion is centered in the middle of my chair , but where the cushion hits my lower back.Right now I am using it on just a regular kind of chair , not an office chair , but it really would n't matter what kind of chair you put it on , it would work just as well.This is just what I needed for my sore back !	1
stays put non elastic strap , firm support , not mushy like the blue ones which do n't stay put . I move it from car to car and use it in the rv .	1
This little cushion is perfectly shaped to fit into the curve of your back and relieve pressure . It feels great ! The cushion comes in a neutral black and gray zippered pouch with an adjustable strap . The strap will fit around the back of most office chairs keeping the cushion in the correct spot to fit the user 's height . Due to upholstery or rails , the strap does n't work with any of the chairs in my home ; but it 's easy to position the cushion while seated , so that 's not a problem.My back feels much better since I started using this cushion . Recommended !	1
I 'm a guy who with the instruction of his chiropractor a few years back , rigs up lumbar support everywhere ... and have tried everything from tennis balls between my lower back and the seat of my car on . this is the best portable lumbar support rig I 've used to date . It is represented as being recommended for office seats and its placement was easy and it works ! However , instead of my `` rolled towel '' I thought I try this on my drivers bucket seat and voila ... like it was MADE for that application ! What most folks do n't realize is that a good lumbar support should feel weird , for a bit . But once you get used to it , not only do you have great results , but it feels weird to sit in a car without one ! I used to drive a lot , and for a guy who is in great shape and works out 1-2 hours every day , I 'd literally crawl out of my car . With the proper lumbar support I bounce out after a drive of any length . The same for folks sitting in their office hour after hour ... proper back/lumbar support can change your life.Anyway ... I 'll stop my rant/rave , Obviously proper lumbar support has changed my life for the better and any tool I can effectively use to aid I 'm up for . This one seems to be made of excellent material ( seems to be breathable ) and is easy to apply to different sized chairs ... . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .	1
this is the most recent product I bought for a tns device when I wanted larger amounts of pads . work fine	1
Yea ! I am so thankful for these pads ! ! ! I have ordered other replacement pads and found that they had something irritating in them and I was left with painful welts after even a short usage.THESE PADS are kind and gentle to my skin , and I can once again enjoy the benefits of my tens unit.Thankful !	1
These toothbrushes are a favorite of my 2 and 3 year olds ! The brush is a prefect size for little hands to easily grasp and the heads consist of round rotating bristles on top and standard non rotating bristles on bottom , the handle has an on and off switch made of a rubber material and a battery is included with every brush making it ready to use immediately . It 's a must have for any Jake fan !	1
Got this for my 4 year old son . Works well . Batteries last a long time in it & my son likes using it . Win : )	1
It is so much easier cleaning my twin toddlers teeth with electric toothbrushes . I really notice a difference in their teeth . My son is into Jake now & loved this brush when it arrived so I usually do n't have a problem getting him to brush . The motion is a little weaker than the Spinbrush I bought for my other son with Thomas & Friends , but it still brushes great . It might even be a little more sensitive on his gums because of it . These brushes are expensive since you have to replace so often , but I guess we 're paying for the rights to the cartoons .	1
These 1.25 readers are perfect for watching television if you wear 2.5 strength for reading . They look and feel great . Very comfortable and cost effective .	1
I 've always liked a black & white combination and these fit the bill . They are fun and comfortable to wear . Come with a matching case .	1
I purchased two more pair of these since they are tight enough to stay on my head . my new fashion statement : )	1
I have tried a variety of brands and flavors of protein bars , including an assorted variety of Pure Protein ones . I have always wound up giving them to my son to finish , as I have never found them to be as tasteful as I like . While I like a little chocolate , I am far from a chocolate fanatic and certainly tend to shy away from things which are `` double chocolate '' or other extreme chocolate flavors . However , I liked the idea of trying these baked bars and am glad I was given the opportunity to do so.These are my favorite protein bars , far and above any others I have ever tried . I do not have an issue with an aftertaste or the sugar alcohols . I would daresay these are as good as eating an unhealthier Snickers bar . I am also glad these are only 190 calories ; many of the ones I have tried before are well over 200 calories.The only drawback is I am afraid I like them a little too much ! It makes them harder to resist while I am continuing a weight loss journey on a caloric restricted diet . Regardless , I have been able to resist over-doing it thus far and find these to be a great treat on occasion.I do think these are a bit overpriced , but this is true of most protein bars . However , Amazon has recently made these available through the S & S ; program and therefore you can get them for 20 % off currently if you have enough items to qualify with Amazon Mom . At the time of this review , they are also offering a 20 % clippable coupon as well which brings the price down to about eighty cents each.Update : The coupon mentioned above is available quite frequently and these bars are still one of my faves ( 2nd overall ) . I have fell in love with the Quest Nutrition - Quest Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough bars as well , especially if you warm them up just a few seconds in the microwave .	1
Very few chocolate/vanilla bars out there for some reason . These are crunchy , and slightly artificial-tasting ( though not in a bad way ) with a slightly thicker coating than other Pure Protein bars . More dessert-like than their older cousins , but still decent nutritionally . Recommended for post-workout snacking or cookie replacement therapy .	1
I have a cupboard full of different bars . This Double Choc Vanilla Crunch is the most tasty . In fact , it tastes a lot better to me than does most of the confectionery I could pick up in a supermarket candy aisle ( this bar is crunchier , just as creamy , and not as over-sweet as most of that chocolate ) . As a pure health food supplement I have to give it only four stars because it is not completely optimized for nutrition and because the taste is so good that over-eating them is a risk .	1
I like the nutrition profile of these bars . 17g of protein in 190 cals is n't bad at all . It 's not a milky way , guys - if you 're looking for candy , this does n't quite make it . But the taste is n't bad , the texture is n't bad , and it 's definitely better than most of the competitors . I 'll buy these again .	1
These things are delicious . If you 're wanting a candy bar tasting protein bar as a treat every once in a while , this is your bar ! It 's almost like a crunchy little debbie swiss roll .	1
My biggest problem with protein bars is that they are chewy and have this weird gritty texture to boot . Having had weight loss surgery , my protein requirements are a little higher than most folks , so I deal with the protein bars from time to time . I 've yet to find one that I absolutely love.This one is actually quite good ... but the front taste of the sugar alcohols is n't great . Once you chew it and get past that initial taste , it 's actually quite yummy . There 's a really nice crunch and it 's satisfying to chew . I ended up grabbing one of these for lunch today and it was great at sating my hunger , giving me some much needed protein and keeping me away from the potato chips.Recommended for those that can get past the sugar alcohol taste - for me , it 's not a huge deal , others I know it bothers .	1
This is a fantastic bar - not chalky , full of crispy bits , and the chocolate tastes like chocolate . This is not a Snickers bar , but it sure comes closer than any other protein bar that I 've tasted , and it has 17g of protein and is under 200 calories . I did n't taste much peanut , but the flavor of the bar was good enough that I did n't miss it .	1
I 'm always trying protein bars to help with post gym workouts & fast meal replacements . This is on the snack size at only 17g , but I do like that it 's low in sugar too . The taste is like a cookie / candy bar which only makes it seem more like an indulgent snack that a nutritional supplement . My favorite part ? The texture . It has a chocolate dipped exterior , peanut butter underneath and a crunchy cookie like center . Personally I love them , the protein & low sugar are just bonus !	1
These are good tasting bars that provide 17 grams of protein with only 14 grams of carbohydrate . Okay , the carbs are mostly from sugar ( 5 grams ) and sugar alcohol ( 4 grams ) . That still makes it a good take along bar for travel snacks with less sugar than most protein bars .	1
take the ingredients of a snicker bar , add some soy and whey protein , and what do you have ? It sure tastes like a candy bar . I really do n't understand the name of this product : `` Pure Protein '' ? As opposed to 'impure protein . ' Surely it 's not meant to mean the only ingredients are protein , when you consider all the saturated fat and sugar this bar contains . But if eating candy bars makes you feel guilty , I guess if you eat this protein-filled candy bar , you can tell yourself that it 's healthful , or at least that the protein cancels out all the fat and sugar . If you do n't have to worry about cholesterol or your weight , or your blood sugar level , go for it . The manufacturers should CELEBRATE that this is a candy bar , not obscure the fact . Candy bar lovers : if your friends say , 'How can you eat that thing , just point to the wrapper and show them the designated 17 grams of protein .	1
These bars are softer , but I would n't go saying they 're like a soft-baked cookie-soft , which I think is the intended implication . Still , they are far less chewy than Pure Protein 's regular bars.The flavor on these was interesting . Something like a peanut butter Oreo , but with less flavor . The slight crunchy topping was a welcome change from the usual gooey or chewy texture of most bars.Pretty good . Ordering them in hot weather is a bad idea though . Some of them melted and reformed and that seriously affected the texture and the flavor .	1
I had weight loss surgery 3 years ago , and part of my post-op life is getting lots and lots of protein . I 've eaten tons of Pure Protein bars over the years because they taste pretty good and have very little sugar , especially compared to most other `` protein '' bars that have as much or more sugar than protein.When I saw Pure Protein was coming out with new bars , I was excited . My last Subscribe & Save delivery of the chewy protein bars is languishing in my pantry because I 've kind of burned out on the old Pure Protein flavors ( Chocolate Deluxe , Chocolate Peanut Butter , and Chewy Chocolate Chip . ) I saw this new Double Chocolate Vanilla Crunch flavor today when I passing through the pharmacy section at Target , so I grabbed a box.I just had my first one , as dessert tonight , and ooooooooh , I am *very* glad I found these . They have a really good texture , kind of like a light brownie with creme-like chunks of vanilla embedded in it , with a chocolate crisp outer coating . They do n't taste too sweet or too dry , and I did n't really notice any fake aftertaste either . I was half-expecting it to taste like those sugar-free diabetic soft-bake cookies or something , but it just tasted good ! If it did n't have protein written all over the box and wrapper , you could have fooled me into thinking it was some kind of snack cake thing.If you like the original Pure Protein bars , then definitely give these new soft bake ones a try . I myself am going to get a box of the new chocolate peanut butter crunch soft bake bar ASAP !	1
The bars taste good , no major aftertaste and great for when you need a quick snack or treat . Good blend of peanut and chocolate . They do melt fairly easily so I would n't leave one in your car or a warm spot .	1
Very good	1
I love this case ! It 's so soft yet it 'll protect the oils bottles from breaking . Especially when in the purse , it 's always between something that may hit something hard . Plus I get to find the oils to use it . Thank you TheraPure Health , for making these .	1
For being a & # 34 ; purse & # 34 ; size this is a little bigger than I thought it would be . However , it functions fine . Some of my oil bottles are a little hard to maneuver in and out but I know they are secure .	1
I love it . I hold some Doterra oils for carrying around . Well padded simple case with clear purpose ! I highly recommend it	1
This is the perfect bag to protect my bottles of oils that I carry with me on a daily basis . Great product .	1
This Tribulus is the real deal . High quality and very fresh according to a trained Herbalist . I have tried most Tribulus products on amazon and this is the best . I cycled this five days on and 2 days off . I take 3 per day . I also used the same brand of Stinging nettles to keep the estrogen at bay . It will take 2 weeks to notice any muscle gain and testosterone related effects . Great Stuff .	1
I thought the these pills went down just fine with no after taste and no jitters which is an important factor for me . Right away I noticed a decrease in appetite and again felt fine and not all hyped up or anything ! Read more at [ ... ]	1
This has helped me so much ! curbs my appetite and helps give my metabolism a boost . Price is great too !	1
Apart from exercising regularly , I also take supplements that will help me achieve my desired weight . Garcina Cambogia helped me lose fat easily and I never felt any side effect . I was still very alert and active .	1
Like many I guess I first learned about Garcinia Gambogia through Dr. Oz . ( Though try as I might I still ca n't pronounce it ! ) I 'm very excited about this product ! Touted as the Holy Grail for Weight loss & # 34 ; , I 'm already seeing results ! So far , the appetite suppressant feature is what has me most excited . Instead of prowling through the house seeking additional sustenance , I find I 'm not even thinking abut eating . The urge is gone . That makes my task that much easier ! The all natural composition is another element that has sold me . I have some issues that are n't compatible with a lot of other supplements.I 'm feeling as though this one may turn out to be exactly what I 've been looking for ! ( I do trust Dr. Oz ' opinion too ! )	1
In all fairness I did n't use this product because I do n't need to loose any weight ! ! having said that a family member did and she loved the results , for many reason first and foremost they worked and they did n't leave her shaking or nausea and they are all natural and I am sure that in its self helps a lot being the main ingredient is from a Garcina Cambogia , Now I am not sure what will happen when she is done taking these Garcina Cambogia pills ! ! That is something to be seen later on because she is still taking them . She got a late start do to her being sick with a bad chest cold ! ! So I really cant tell if they continue to work after the pills are done.Having said that she said they seem to work great she has less of an appetite she said she is eating less and seem to be pretty impressed with her results so far so I guess its a win win.Time will have to tell for long term results , but in any case they are all natural and that to me is a big plus for anyone trying to loose weight please check this company out	1
Do you ever wake up feeling tired , nonstop hunger , and just ca n't lose weight ? Pure Garcinia Cambogia is best known as the # 1 pill to Stop Appetite and Burn Fat ! Its been a 100 % Natural Clinically Proven and provides the best amount of Hydroxycitric Acid ( HcA ) at 60 % . The pill is made of Garcinia , which is a citrus fruit tree found in India , Southeast Asia and parts of Africa . It yields a small , oval-shaped yellow fruit no larger than a peach . The fruit 's rinds are dried and powdered for their medicinal benefits.The HcA Percentage is at a perfect amount for better weight loss . The more HcA the better it is working with your body to stop carbs and sugar from turning to fat when you easily chow down on that doughnut for breakfast with coffee . You get a nice 500mg amount per pill , which is easier to take then 1000 or 1500 mg larger pill before a meal.Its simple to take and all you need to do is have one 30-60mins before a meal to allow time for it to get absorbed in the body . The way it works is it helps blocking the change of carbs and sugar to fat . so with the natural fruit rind , which this pill is only made of , you will find that your appetite is reduced and you wo n't crave or need more to be full as you use too.What everyone should know and I found out to be absolutely true is that you can eat what ever you enjoy . I mean I 'm not going to say go eat a huge pizza in one sitting , but you can have a few slices and not worry about it turning into fat . My diet has changed ever since I started taking these . I do n't just eat low carb and just think that I 'm stuck to only eating the same thing over and over without ever trying a different type of food , but now I do enjoy things I love like pasta . I found for myself that with these pills help curb my appetite and I do n't have as much hunger to snack in between meals.I 'd like to say it 's been easy for me to take with water since it 's not a giant huge pill to swallow . I very much hate having to take a giant pill , with the chance of it getting stuck in my throat , which really is painful plus the taste of pills are n't as pleasant to have caught in your throat . Finally , the benefit of it being pure and not containing any artificial ingredients or fillers is just super as well . I rather have a natural product with out those stimulants that could cause more damage to your body then it could help .	1
*Received a bottle for free in exchange for my review*As January comes to an end many of you are probably thinking about that New Year 's resolution you made on January 1 . This was actually one of the first years that weight loss was not my first resolution however I like many Americans would love to lose some weight . Those excited to get an opportunity to work with elite Gold solutions and try out their pure and powerful Garcinia Cambogia.Above is an image that gives you some more information on what this dietary supplement can do for you . As you can see from the list above this supplement will help suppress your appetite , decreased belly fat , boost your mood and help improve your sleep . And I must tell you after using this for just over three weeks I can say that all the above is true . Things to this amazing supplement I have felt better and eat better.One thing that I really like about the supplement is that it 's all natural . In addition it contains no fillers and binders or artificial ingredients they truly stuck to their all-natural fat burner statement that they 've made . Another thing that I truly was impressed with is that there made in the USA there free from GMO and 100 % vegan and gluten-free . Another statement that they may was extremely pure and potent and would have to agree with the statement as I have nothing but positive things to say about the supplement . I plan on ordering another bottle and continuing at the end of this month and very impressed with the results I 've received and hope to continue to receive similar results in the coming months .	1

This product really helped to curb my appetite . And , I had no side effects , which is a very important factor to me . Also , I experienced the `` I 'm full feeling '' , sooner . Before taking this product , there were days that I did not even have the `` I 'm full , feeling . `` I not only lost pounds , but inches during the month I have been taking Elite Gold Garcinia Cambogia . I have other family members that have purchased it , due to my success . This is a definite re-purchase product for me . Vicki @ Dragonfly Tales [ ... ]	1
my husband tried these pills and said within 20 minutes you felt a surge of energy and had to get up and move	1
I absolutely love these Energy Pills ! I have 2 toddlers and I have to be on the go all day ! These really help and they help me with not snacking and curbing my appetite . They also do n't give me the jitters and an upset stomach like some of these types of pills have in the past ! These are a must-have for anyone on the go that needs a pick-me-up . Do not take late in the day though..will keep you up .	1
Full-Time Energy Pills are the best fat burning/weight loss pill I have found ! These pills deliver quick results , without the heart racing jitters I have felt before with other energy supplements.In just a few weeks , I have lost 9 pounds off of , mostly , my belly and thighs and I feel the energy that had been slipping away , returning . There is no big rush after taking the pills , nor is there the usual crash I have felt with energy pills in the past . This energy booster feels perfectly balanced to me.I wake up looking forward to the challenges of the day ahead now and know that I will have the endurance to , not only get through , but break through my accomplishments . I look better , my skin is better , I am losing weight and I feel hope that I have not felt in a long time . What is there not to like about that ? I highly recommend Full-Time Energy Booster Supplement for any one wishing to reclaim their health , pride in their body and enthusiasm for life !	1
OMG I Truly love this Full Time Energy Pills . they work great . Thank you so much , They have me feeling full of energy .	1
I am always looking for a pick me up and coffee can sometimes get boring so I was looking for something new to try . This product does it all . It helps me lose weight effortlessly and have more energy throughout the day . What I love most about this product is that it is a multi-tasking product and that is does two things all at once . The ingredients in the product are great as well . Overall , this product is working great and is helping me do so much more now that I have more energy and am losing weight .	1
Great product ! ! If you want energy all day long . This is a great energy booster for men and women . The best part about it is that it is all natural .	1
I started taking Full-Time Energy Pills for added energy level along with shedding a few pounds . I had to quit taking other energy pills because I felt nervous , jittery and hyper . I did n't feel like myself . After taking the other energy pills it never failed that in a few hours you would totally feel exhausted . You would have such a crash that you would have to take another dose just to keep going on with your day . The Full-Time Energy Pills are totally opposite . There is no crash in the afternoon or when the pill starts to wear off . You do n't have any nervous or jittery feeling at all . It brings a comfortable energy level that is wonderful.I have been taking Full-Time Energy for over a week now and it 's not much , but I have lost four pounds . This is a wonderful start . I feel great . I do n't take a nap every day , but I am using that time to work out . The Full-Time Energy supplement keeps me energized so I can actually feel like work out as I never could last before . The best part of this supplement is it is all natural . It is safe to take.My husband has seen a change in me and now is beginning to take Full-Time Energy as well . He depended on energy drinks to keep him going through the day at work . He would drink several of these energy drinks each day . My husband has the energy he needs and has totally quit drinking the expensive energy drinks each day . He feels great and has a totally different mood and attitude . I was always worried about him drinking so many of those energy drinks each day as they can be very harmful to one 's health.I recommend the Full-Time Energy for everyone . You do n't have to want to lose weight or looking for a weight loss pill to get benefits from this pill . The added energy is amazing , but you will gain muscle if you do n't want to lose weight as you will be so active that you will see a difference in your body . The price is affordable . The Full-Time Energy offers a full money-back guarantee . Try it . You wo n't be returning it as you will see results quickly .	1
Sometimes I get tired or warn out at work and need a boost . I usually use iSatori Energize All Day Energy Pill , Tablets and I like that item.This is a bit stronger . This item helps perk you up but try it ( one capsule ) and see it works for you.Always read the label and always follow direction/dosage ! The first time it made me a little jittery , since then I empty a little out of the capsule to reduce the dose ( only 1 capsule ) .I tried a whole capsule after a meal and that helped .	1
I really felt good wearing the compressions socks , though they did seem to run a tad small . We go on long car trips and the compression socks help keep my ankles from swelling . My legs felt comfortable and energized ! For a long day of standing or long trips sitting you ca n't go wrong with these compression socks . The quality was very nice and the socks were thinner than I expected , a plus , they do n't look like thick granny socks ! Compression socks provided for review	1
I 've struggled putting the heavier , toeless compression stockings on more people you can count . And it was a struggle . What made it particularly difficult were the seams that had to be lined up properly or I 'd have to start again . In some instances , that would be a somewhat painful proposition.I do like the FYTTO brand because they are very easy to put on and equally easy to remove . They are a comfortable 25 % Spandex and 74 % nylon , a combination that will snag slightly , but so far no runs . Kind of a given there , but one advantage is that they do n't have the added bulk of the heavier stockings and can be worn without anyone `` knowing '' they are compression socks.They are also lightweight and you can pull on a pair of footies or socks over them . Provided your feet are n't overly swollen ( that 's what these socks are for ) , you can simply slip your feet into a pair of shoes . One other nice thing is the affordability factor . These are less than half the price of some others I 've had to purchase for people.FEATURES : & # 9658 ; Fytto 's Style 133 Women 's Ultra Sheer Knee High at 15-20 mmHg with reinforced heel and toe , thin like your second skin ! & # 9658 ; Specially designed elastic band allows maximum wear time without dropping , skin irritation , or leaving marks . Breathable and comfortable , thin like your second skin ! & # 9658 ; Additional thickness added to the heel area to provide extra stability . Extra space at toe area to move around comfortably without restriction. & # 9658 ; Material content : 25 % Spandex , 75 % Nylon . Choose from nude , black , and glowing apricot colorBoth the heel and toe sections are reinforced , much in the manner of `` regular nylons . The top band is elasticized and double-stitched at the fold . The workmanship and quality are right out-of-the-package nice . The only tussling you 'll need to do with these socks is get those toe seams straight and aligned before pulling them up . Make sure you pull consistently around the sock as you pull them up , otherwise they will bunch at the ankle.Care is easy , but must be adhered to . If you accidentally shoot these in the dryer ( been there , done that ) , you can lose some of the compression . Washing by hand is the best way to take care of the socks after every use . You should use a mild detergent , cool water , and air dry them . Before using , you should obviously consult your physician first . Nice quality and definitely a good price point.Sample provided for review .	1
I have a few pairs of 1020 socks from Fytto in black and nude colors . The seller was kind enough to send their new color for me to try for free ! However I was looking for something that 's thinner and lighter , so I gave this new 133 socks a try . Turned out to be just as good as the 1020s . it 's even more breathable since it 's a really thin layer of fabric . It might be a little be harder to put on and stretches out somewhat less , but as a woman with ordinary calf size , I do n't have any problem putting these on . I have no problem wearing these inside my jeans , as they are really comfortable . The compression effect is just as good as the 1020s if not better . Definitely helps me reduce tiredness in my legs . If you 've purchased the Fytto socks before , give this one a try . If you have n't , the 133 and the 1020 are the two best ones out there , your best bet is to start from them !	1
These compression socks are very nice . They are soothing and pain relieving . I used them for an extended period of time and they were gorgeous . No skin irritation or marks after wearing for long times.I liked the material comfort and the comments I got from friends . I used them on a long walk and a train ride ! Highly recommend ! I was provided this product in exchange of a fair and honest review .	1
& # 34 ; WOW & # 34 ; This product really knocks me off my feet ! once taking i can feel a full powerful burst of energy ! this product works and does just what it says it would do . it keeps me full , burning all that Nasty Fat ! Full Time Fat Burner is such a great powerful Natural Fat Burning Supplement that really works ! I love that this product can be use for Both Men And Women ! So my advise to you all is give it a try ! Thanks ! : )	1
So As far as I can tell these pills seem to helping me with my goals of losing 40lbs.I have a long way to go , but taking these seems to shorten the length of time I 'm going to need to lose that much weight .	1
This product is great ! ! ! It can be used by men and women . That is what is so great about it . I will definitely used this product continuously .	1
I do n't have time for exercise but my full time I used fat burner that works very fast.The Best Natural Fat Burning Supplement.It works 8 hours when I got another time for my business.I feel experience a natural feeling energy.I used month and see my results.I got goals quickly and easily.Nice price . I like it .	1
This is a good appetite suppressant . Since it contains caffeine , I would not take it with an evening meal . Caffeine does keep me awake . But since we are different it may not bother you . It seems to give a lot of energy which in turn helps burn calories . This is a new product and will take a little while before I know the full effects . If you are interested in losing weight , I suggest you try it .	1
We 've had no problems with the Disgestive Advantage Probiotic Gummies . My daughter who has recently had two different bouts with antibiotics was advised to take probiotics to restore the bacteria in her gut and these worked very well in comparison to the Good Belly drinks I purchased that she did n't like . I tried two different flavors and she did n't drink them , but these gummies taste good and went down easy and have the added benefit of fiber . The probiotics also help to boost the immune system . My husband after travelling thought he could have picked up salmonella after eating a chicken salad . There was an outbreak recently in California because of chicken so I started him taking the probiotics and after a week of suffering and a couple of weeks with this product he seems to be much better . Travelling itself seems to take a lot out of a person and if this restores the belly and builds up immunities , it is a good thing . The added fiber is a big plus , especially when travelling when one may not be getting any extra fiber.These may be a little expensive but worth the price if you have recently taken antibiotics or have had stomach ailments . They do help !	1
While waiting for what turned into a delayed flight , I first opened my jar of gummies . You have to break the seal under the cap , and this drew attention . The gate was full of people from a convention and one immediately noticed that this product has the bacillus coagulans ( BC30 ) strain . He knew about this new bacteria strain . Apparently it 's just recently been fast-tracked and quickly approved by the FDA . BC30 is supposed to be 30 times as potent as the probiotics in yogurt.There are only 45 gummies in a jar and they taste very good . Before I knew it the jar was emptied because of the one guy and his ability to include everybody . Some helped themselves to small handfuls and they would not consider how it 's not candy . The flight was just horrible not merely because of the delay . The stink was violating and ungodly . I had my vent on full blast.This probiotic strain is not like the ones in yogurt . It quickly makes its way to the intestines where the bacteria get very active and produce sulfur dioxide . Maybe it 's a good idea to take half a gummy for starters when one 's schedule allows for a bodily adjustment .	1
I absolutely love gummy candies so being able to take my fiber in this form is a win-win for me . I 've been taking two of these a day for the last several weeks and I do believe that they are helping . They actually taste pretty good and are easy for me to remember to take , because they are almost a treat . I have n't yet decided whether I 'll buy these after my review bottle is gone , mainly because of the price , but I am considering them .	1
The Schiff Digestive Advantage is a probiotic gummy with fiber . It promotes digestion in 2 ways , the probiotic is great for digestion and the added fiber aids in regularity.The directions say to take 2 gummies daily . Two pieces of gummies provides 20 calories , 6 carbs and 3 grams of fiber . Since they are gummies , they have sugar and corn syrup added to give that sweet flavor so they are tasty to take . They taste good , they smell horrible.I personally would rather take a pill than the gummies because I do n't want the added sugar but gummies are a good alternative for those individuals who have trouble swallowing a pill .	1
I was excited to try these because I saw a TV commercial for this product . The commercial and their website talk about a two week challenge . They claim that 2 weeks usage of this product could improve occasional abdominal discomfort and bloating or your money back . Check their website for detail on the guarantee and a coupon.I felt I had some bloating going on and I definitely had some abdominal discomfort ( in my case gas ) These taste great and I did not notice any bad scent that some other reviewers noticed . The recommended dosage is two per day . I took them before breakfast and dinner . The websites states they can reduce gas if taken before a meal so that was my game plan.I am a little over two weeks in and Im still bloated ( fat ) but I have much less gas ! The added fiber did not have any adverse effects on me . When these are finished up I am going to take a break from them . If the gas returns I will purchase again.Overall I think these are worth a try if you are seeking help with a minor digestive issue .	1
Great probiotic makes my stomach feel nice . The gummies taste just like gummy bears but without the sugar and gas associated with candy . It aided in my digestion and aaahhh I feel good !	1
I 've been taking Gummy Probiotic from Schiff for a while now . It 's a great alternative for those who have a hard time swallowing pills . These probiotic are tasteful and easy to intake . I take the suggested dose of two gummies per day . I believe it helps my digestive system and helps regulate me . I 'm not going every day , but way more often than when I was n't on probiotics .	1
I think that the majority of studies for probiotics have yet to be able to prove that probiotics actually do anything . I suppose anecdotes are really all they can go on . I have Crohn 's Disease , so I am always looking for new delivery systems for probiotics , since I do not like yogurt . These are appealing , sweet and sour flavored gummies , with fiber . I took them as directed , twice a day , and they might have improved things , although , fortunately I am healthy at this time.I would possibly purchase these , although they seem a little pricey , considering at two a day ( the recommended dosage ) , this bottle wo n't even last a month .	1
These taste really good- But make me really really gassy- Supposed to take two a day , this is less then a 30 day supply- They taste super good , I felt great while I took them but had more gas then usual ( which I usually do n't have any gas ) Great rid of the gas effect and they would be five stars !	1
I replaced 6 capsules daily with two gummies . Product works well and tastes fine . As usual , Amazon has a better price than big name stores .	1
As most reviewers have said , these taste very good . I 'm a little concerned about the sugar coating on them , however . I 've been wanting to try a probiotic and this one is certainly pleasant to take . In order to see the effects , I 'll have to keep using them for a while . They supply fiber and there is n't an easier way to get that in your diet than to take this product . I 'm going to give it a true trial and see how things go .	1
Wow ... . starting using two per day . No more heartburn or AR from spicy foods ... ..and no more antacids for me ... ... Wow	1
Tastes good makes getting fiber a little easier.I do n't like the fiber drinks and I have a hard time with large or chalky pills . That is why I 've love the gummies that have been coming out for supplements . This is a great one ! Probiotics + fiber in a good tasting chew . That plus Schiff is a name I trust !	1
These gummies taste great . I eat two every morning with my gummy vitamin and fiber choice ! It is so much easier to take vitamins in a gummy form .	1
love to take easy vitamins via gummies with additional fiber so vital to my weight management and health ... I buy them for my mom and mail them to her too	1
I 'm a huge fan of Probiotics , so to see an kid-friendly Probiotic and fiber supplement that actually tastes good is great . Due to the cost , these wo n't be an every-day vitamin , but when the kids are complaining and experiencing constipation , or after using an antibiotic I will not hesitate to use these.None of us experienced any problems while taking these , but we went through them in 6 days ( 4 person family , 2 per day except the last day where everyone got 1 ) My only question is pertaining to the Probiotics - the only ones I 've taken have come in yogurt or come in pills that you keep in the refrigerator . I was n't aware that Probiotics kept their benefits at room temperature or stored for any length of time .	1
I bought this as a good source of Omega 3 . It is good for that and you do not have a fish or oil taste in your stomach . One thing I was not prepared for is how large it is . The regular MegaRed is a very small pill , I expected this to be a bit larger , but it 's actually about 4 times as large , in a capsule shape . When I run out , I 'm going back to the little ones .	1
This is the best one of the kril oil caps available . I take this to reduce triglycerides as I can not tolerate statins . Not even the prescription grade fish oil . These are a large cap , but it 's soft and does n't bother me . It does n't have any aftertaste or odor , and it does what it says it does . Great item .	1
These are good tasting enough to be candy even without the addition of hyaluronic acid.Ordinarily I avoid anything with corn syrup in it . That 's the first ingredient in these , followed by sugar and gelatin.I will never stop taking hyluronic acid , not only because it protects my joints . I am a runner and distance walker on a daily basis and if I stop taking it , my knees let me know they are n't happy.Also , my skin glows and plumps and looks healthy when I take it . And I 'm sure there are other internal effects I do n't know about , since hyluronic acid helps many types of tissues retain moisture.Two of these , the recommended dose per day , contain only 3.3 mg of hyluronic acid . The usual dose to relieve osteoarthritis symptoms is 20 to 50 mg per day , so these may not be strong enough for many people with joint pain.Be aware that hyluronic acid can also cause side effects in a small number of people such as fever , swollen patches of skin , difficulty breathing , swollen eyelids , and diarrhea.These are really delicious . I probably wo n't continue on taking them after I finish this bottle due to the corn syrup , but if that 's not something you are concerned about , I recommend these as not only a wonderful supplement , but a fun small daily treat . And Schiff is a brand that has been around forever , and one I trust .	1
I have been taking these as directed and noticed a difference after about a week . My joints are moving much better now and do n't pop hardly at all . I love the gummies also . They seem to absorbe in the stomache much easier than capsules . You do n't have to eat a full meal with them . A few crackers will do !	1
This product provides Hyaluronic Acid and Uniflex which is Fruitex-B in a chewable gummy . The fruit flavored gummies are rather rubbery but have a pleasing fruity flavor . HA provides cushioning and lubrication in the joints and eyes . Fruitex-B is a super bioavailable form of born . It is reputed to help people with osteoarthritis and osteoporosis as well as angina . It is believed that modern farming practices have caused the depletion of trace minerals such as boron , leading to an increase in the occurrence of arthritis.These gummies are easy to take and certainly helpful to those who ca n't or do n't like to swallow pills . I ca n't say I have noticed any impact whatsoever . However my brother who has a bad knee and my mother who suffers from arthritis both credit this product with a reduction in pain and an increase in mobility . My brother has not had a flare up of knee pain since adding this to his regimen . Both of them take a glucosamine supplement as well . It could be the placebo effect but as any one who has suffered joint or bone pain can tell you , if it works , it is well worth it . In any event , these are convenient and contain ingredients that seem to support bone and joint health . recommended .	1
I bought these for my husband who spends quite a bit of time running and riding a bike , and occasionally complains of sore joints . I am not sure that there is any medicine or supplement on the planet that he could take to make soreness go away , but he thought he 'd like to give it a try . After a couple weeks of use he reports no change in his aching legs , but does like the taste and so continues to use them in hopes they will make him feel better . Would I buy the again ? Not exactly sure at this point . I think the price point is a bit high for just 30 days worth of product .	1
These are an effective replacement for the regular pill form of this product . I find the gummies easier to swallow and I tend to take them more regularly because of that . I 'm getting to the age when I need this product and the tastier version helps me to take them regularly .	1
This is a great product for joints . It has hyaluronan ( hyaluronic acid ) and that 's very good . Human turn over one-third of their body 's hyaluronan each day so it 's a good supplement to ensure that joints are served well . It feels odd to me to chew sweet gummies rather than swallow a tablet - may need getting used to this delivery method .	1
I occasionally experience joint pain due to over exertion while weight training ( shoulder ) or playing recreational tennis ( hips ) . I was eager to give this Schiff Move Free Gummies a try.Likes : *Each bottle comes with 70 button sized gummies ( 35 daily servings ) . Recommended intake is 2 gummies daily with a meal . *Chewy with assorted natural fruit flavors . *Each serving contains 216mg of `` Uniflex '' ( Calcium Fructoborate ) and 3.3mg of `` Joint Fluid '' ( Hyaluronic Acid ) . These ingredients are supposed to comfort joints and support cartilage health.Do they work ? After taking these Move Free Gummies for one week , I felt less soreness around my shoulders after weight training sessions , and after 1-2 hours of tennis . Could be placebo effect or more careful warmups and stretching.Concerns : *The gummies have gotten tougher to chew during colder winter months . *Flavoring is mild , but does leave a bit of vitamin/supplement aftertaste . *Sweetened with corn syrup and sugar , these chewy gummies tend to get stuck between teeth and on the chewing surfaces ; risk for dental decay.Overall : Easy to take joint health supplement gummies . Good for an after meal snack . Seem to reduce my joint soreness but I do n't like the corn syrup sweetener .	1
I have athritis in my hip , I take these along with fish oil and joint juice and my pain is pretty much gone .	1
These are convenient and taste good . I got them so my husband could keep some at his desk . Not having to find water to take a pill and having some HA in the middle of the day ca n't hurt . He has arthritis and these seem to help if he remembers to take them . Could n't be any easier with the Gummies and it 's like a treat .	1
I trust Schiff nutritional supplements and am currently trying theMove Free Joint Supplement Gummies with Hyaluronic Acid and Uniflex , 70 Count . I have been taking Glucosamine for years with beneficial results and noted that my first course was using the Schiff product . Being unfamiliar with Uniflex ( Fruitex-B Calcium Fructoborate ) and Hyaluronic Acid , this bottle of 70 gives me just over a month of trials since I chew two a day . I ca n't attest to the products ' effectiveness because it 's new to me , but I can say that the gummies are not offensive and they take a minute to chew . I think that should a person find the need for Hyaluronic Acid and Uniflex but have difficulty swallowing as occurs with some disorders as well as aging , these are a great option . At the cost of about fifty cents a day , I do think this supplement is expensive , however if it works for those who prefer or need a chewable option , then I say give it a try .	1
This is probably my favorite gummy supplement that I have ever tried . It 's a tiny bit sweet , but really not very sweet . All of the other gummy supplements that I 've tried have been too sweet.This is a formula of Hyaluronic Acid and Calcium Fructoborate , both of which really help out the joints . It does n't have very much Hyaluronic Acid , though , only 3.3 mg , and the gummies are probably about 500 mg each , so it has less than 1 % Hyaluronic Acid.This helped a lot with my joints . I feel like I can move a lot more freely after having taking these supplements.Pros : +Not too much sugar+Great support for joints+Taste good , and good for youCons : -Three different colors of gummies . This does make the product look attractive , but it does highlight to me how much dye is in it.-Not much Hyaluronic Acid	1
Move Free Joint Supplement Gummies with Hyaluronic Acid and Uniflex , 70 CountI & # 8217 ; ve been taking Move Free for years . I use the regular whit pills . This was my opportunity to try a different method of taking a product that has worked for me . I & # 8217 ; ve had shoulder issues and Move Free has helped me regain mobility . This version I am sure will continue to help me and it tastes pretty good too . Unlike the pill there are thirty calories and some sugar to account for . If you have an aversion to pills or you already take too many this is an option . It tastes good and kind of fools you into taking something that is good for you . As for me , I don & # 8217 ; t need the extra sugar and I & # 8217 ; m fine with the pills . At least you have a choice and it & # 8217 ; s a very good product , it has helped me .	1
I have been taking joint supplements for a couple of years now and I 've tried them all . Most are relatively large caplets but I feel they work so I choke them down anyway . Well now I 'm considering a surgery that will impact my ability to choke down large pills so I 've decided to find chewable versions of as many of my favorites as possible.These are pretty tasty . They are soft , chewy and they do n't stick together as badly in the bottle as some other gummy versions I 've tried . They are fruit flavored and you only need to chew 2 a day . Easy and tasty , does it get any better ?	1
I like the way these taste- just like gummy bears . I ca n't taste any medicine in them . You take 2 a day . My arthritis does seem a bit improved too- I was having problems with my back when I started these and it is much , much improved , and I have less stiffness in the morning . Sam-E maybe worked a bit better , but these are good and taste a lot better.The lid is not childproof and I 'd be careful with these around kids , who may think they are candy .	1
I swear that at first I started feeling better with this , but then , the weather became rainy and awful , and it proved useles . Nice bottle , and love the gummies , but their effectivenes is still questioned by my reality.At least is not a scam as that product Instaflex , which claims what does not achieve and costs a bundle .	1
As I 've stated in multiple reviews , I am a gummy vitamin fanatic due to a lifelong problem digesting pills . Thank goodness the rest of the world has caught up to us sufferers and developed such wonderful , healthy alternatives to not taking anything at all.I have seen this brand at Costco , Wal-Mart and other vendors in pill form but was unable to try them and was also concerned about not seeing the usual glucosamine/chondroiten combination for joint relief . It appears that the Schiff Company ( which has been around almost since the dawn of time ) is using Hyaluronic Acid and something called Uniflex ( which contains FruiteX-B Calcium Fructoborate ) as their primary components for keeping our joints healthy . And they are now in gummy form.My experience with this product has been positive so far . The taste is excellent - fruity but with no icky aftertaste or over-the-top sweetener infusion , and you wo n't have to chew them for an eternity ( like other products ) before getting them to disolve . I 've had no adverse reactions like stomach aches or indigestion and can not believe how far the vitamin industry has come along in gummies from when they first started to appear.I can not honestly say if there has been a vast improvement in my joints since I 've only been using this brand for about 6 days . However , I can confidently claim that I will continue to enjoy Move Free along with my other supplements for a very long time . Each person 's body adjusts differently and so I will re-visit this review in a few weeks to let you know if I 've noticed any significant positive changes . But if you 've been on the fence about taking a gummy for your joint health , I believe this is an excellent choice .	1
I am currently taking all my supplements , fiber , vitamins , etc. , in gummie form , and these are not quite as sweet as the others . Other than that , to fairly review them , I will have to check back in six months to a year .	1
I just started taking these so I ca n't comment on how well they work yet but I can definitely say that they taste good and are easy to eat : ) I 'll update this review after taking them for a while to post on their effectiveness.edit : This supplement does n't actually contain glucosamine . It has `` joint fluid '' ( hyaluronic acid ) and Uniflex ( fruiteX-B calcium fructoborate ) . Both are listed on the web as aiding in joint health but I figured it was worth posting that this does not actually contain glucosamine .	1
I have tried the `` Move Free '' tablets before , and even though they are on the smaller side for a supplement , I sometimes have issues swallowing them . Theses gummies are a good alternative for people who have a smaller windpipe or for some reason have issues choking down a pill . They are very chewy , but taste fine with a reasonably good fruit flavor.They 're very similar to gummy candy , unsurprisingly , so they may not be good if you have dental work that may be damaged by a sticky candy . They do n't taste in any way `` off '' or medicinal , but they are n't like real candy in that they are n't as sweet . That being said , I 'd keep them away from children because they may not be able to distinguish . I do n't know if they 'd be dangerous if many were consumed , but it would certainly be a waste of money ( if nothing else ) if a child gobbled them down . Since the bottle warns you not to take more than the recommended dose , it probably would not be a good idea to eat a lot of them.Since all supplements are essentially an act of faith in terms of whether or not they work and no individual can know if they are effective , I wo n't try to speak to the value of these types of joint supplements in solving your problems . I do believe they are helpful , or I would n't be taking them , but I can mainly speak to their price and usability . These are not the cheapest gummi suppiliments out there by a long shot as they are 31 cents each ( `` Body Boost '' gummies are 22 cents each , but you 're supposed to take 3 per day so the cost ends up being the same ) , but they are one of the few out there which contains hyaluronic acid ( which is supposed to help with joint movement ) .I liked these a lot and , while I wish they were more economical , I find them enjoyable to take and will continue to do so .	1
***REVISED REVIEW DATED 12/30/13***I tried theMove Free Advanced Plus MSM & Vitamin D - 80 Countin 2008 ( this is the kind with glucosamine and chondroitin plus MSM and Vitamin D ) . I not only had problems physically swallowing the number of capsules involved , I had problems with nausea while taking it . Further , I saw no improvement in joint pain . I have arthritis in my spine , knees and feet , and a chewed-up meniscus in my right knee ( courtesy of my arthritis ) that causes me pain on a fairly regular basis.These Move Free Total Joint Health gummies do NOT contain glucosamine and chrondroitin . Instead , they contain Uniflex `` to comfort joints and support cartilage health '' and Hyaluronic Acid ( aka joint fluid ) `` to help support joint comfort . '' A serving size is 2 gummies , which contain 3.3 mg of the latter and 216 mg of the former . The bottle warns against taking more than that.Smell : So many supplements have a horrendous smell . When you take off the cap of these gummies and take a whiff , it smells like Koolaid or real gummies ! Taste : These gummies taste FANTASTIC ! They come in a variety of fruit flavors ( cherry and blueberry are my personal faves ) . I do n't detect any medicinal taste . Some days it is hard to stop at two ! : ) Texture : They are SO chewy that , when I first tried them , it took a while to get my daily dose of 2 gummies down the hatch . Now that I 've been through 2 bottles , the texture hardly bothers me at all.Efficacy : When I originally reviewed these gummies on September 3 , 2013 , I had only been using them for two weeks and I had seen no improvement in pain or mobility . I finished that bottle but chose not to repurchase the gummies . A few weeks later , after having gone without the gummies for a while , I went on a physically-taxing ( for me , considering my issues ) vacation and had a great deal of pain in my feet and knees . A few weeks after I got home from vacation , I realized that I 'd not been taking the gummies for about a month . I took a chance that it would help and bought another bottle . Wow , that time I really DID see a difference in my pain level and in my mobility , especially with my arthritic knee/chewed meniscus.I have now been through two full bottles of these gummies ( though with a month in between ) and am here to put myself on Subscribe and Save to receive the gummies regularly . I ca n't say for absolute certain that the gummies are what is giving me relief , but I CAN say that I 'm not having to take as many Aleve on an ongoing basis as I had been when I was n't taking the gummies.I have increased my rating from 3 stars to 4 ( an average of 5 stars for taste , 3 for texture and 4 for efficacy ) .	1
I deal with osteoarthritis so having joint supplements is a necessity . This makes it easy to digest rather than the standard long white tablets that can be difficult to swallow day after day .	1
My sister takes these because she has a lot of problems with her joints , and she said they help her . I was curious if they would help me because I have a few problems with my hips and worry it may get worse , especially since I 'm over 50 . I take glucosamine , but wondered if these would improve the results . I did n't care for the taste and texture of the gummies , but I do n't like gummy candy either . My sister prefers these because she ca n't swallow pills , so they do serve a purpose for people like her . I have been taking these for almost a month and I do n't see an improvement over what I experience with my normal routine of glucosamine . My sister , on the other hand , experienced a noticeable improvement in her joint pain . She has been taking these for a few months . I failed to ask her how long she took them before she noticed an improvement , so it 's possible that I need to buy another bottle before I see improvement . I 'm not sure I 'll do it because I do n't enjoy the gummy bear experience . However , the ingredients are also available in other versions .	1
I have taken all kinds of combination supplements to help with my joints especially my knees . Glucosamine and Chondroitin have been part of my regimen for a long but my body sometimes quits responding to low doses . This supplement has a different combination of Hyaloronic Acid and Calcium Fructoborate ( first time I 've take this ) . They have helped me during the day I have noticed a difference and I can function normally . I am very happy with them and they are tasty . The only thing I noticed is that the dose is 2 gummies and I need 3 gummies to get me through the day . If I take only 2 gummies I am in pain in the evening again . The bottle states not to take more than 2 gummies a day so I do n't know what would happen if I keep taking 50 % more than the recommended dose . So far I am feeling good , I will continue to take them until they 're gone . Like with any other supplement , I recommend during research before any purchasing .	1
My wife and I have to take glucosamine for her joints due to playing competitive sports during our younger days . When I saw this product , I knew I had to get it for her as it comes in the form of gummies as opposed to regular pills that need swallowing.One of the component that I found on this product was `` Uniflex '' . Research is still relatively new with regards to `` Uniflex '' - Calcium Fructoborate , but it is said to also reduce inflammation of the joints as well as inhibiting cancerous cell growth while inducing normal cell death . I am quite concern about this but apparently the positive effects are more than any negative ones.Thus far , my wife is happy with the supplement and has no ill side-effects .	1
I have been taking PQQ for almost a month now . I have noticed some improvement in my ability to recall things . I guess though cant prove it yet , that PQQ is responsible . I like the small caps , very easy to swallow and the fact that it takes only 1 cap per day to do the job . i will keep on using it and determine the effects more on the long term .	1
I have taken a number of Jarrow Formulas supplements over the past several years , and I consider them to be a trusted brand known for high quality products . I decided to try Pyrroloquinoline Quinone ( PQQ ) when I read about how it aids with energy and memory . I have been taking it regularly for just under one month , and it has already helped me . I try to start my morning with exercise and then often follow-up with a second workout in the evening after work . Often I simply do n't have the strength , particularly in the mornings when sleeping an extra half hour feels very tempting . Since taking these PQQ supplements , I feel more energized throughout the day so I am less likely to skip workouts . For that reason alone , it 's worth recommending , but there 's an added benefit - clarity of mind.I have two children and , like many , a stressful life . I do n't really suffer from memory loss , but I do get cloudy from time to time , distracted to the point that I might overlook something obvious . I think that these PQQ supplements have cleared the fog for me , at least during some of the more stressful moments of my day . Simply put , I just feel better overall , and though it may be psychological to a degree , I will give credit to these supplements .	1
I bought these pills after listening to the body show as a suggestion from a naturopathic doctor on what types of supplements/remedies to take upon feeling ill to prevent illness . however , I could n't 1. swallow the rather large pills , and 2. thought the recommended dosage was incredibly high . I 'll just stick to honey and chamomile tea at this point .	-1
THIS DOES NOT WORK AT ALL ! ! ! ! SO DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS ONE AND THE MONEY FOR IT NOT WORTH IT	-1
Am not buying this product.Dr . Oz said we MUST TAKE 1,600 each day ! So , you need to take 800 mgs twice daily . If you buy this is does have the correct percent of HCA ( 60 % ) but you need to take TWO 400 mgs twice a day to accomplish the 1,600 mgs ! You are going to rip thru this bottle in no time so I would n't buy it . Without the 1,600 mgs each day AND the 60 % HCA you are wasting your money !	-1
I think that this was worth the money . I think that they wanted you taking too much of these pills a day and I did n't see any results . I am dieting and exercising and drinking a ton of water . Just not getting the results I thought I would .	-1
I use Scotch-brite scrubbing sponges all the time , so this little contraption seemed pretty awesome . As a spong , it is pretty great , just like any other Scotch you have had before . There are Non-Stick Safe heads and heavy duty heads , but the directions warn to try the non-stick head in an innocuous spot before going all crazy on your pan . The heads have a decent scrub pad and a hard plastic attachment that hooks to the wand . The tip of the wand 's handle unscrews for the detergent . All pretty standard.My issue is the `` soap dispensing '' . The button you push to dispense is nothing more than a little rubbery bubble that barely depresses and certainly is n't connected to anything . Therefore when it depresses ( a minimal tiny fraction of an inch- a millimeter perhaps ? ) , nothing happens . The hole where the detergent comes through is understandably small ( to prevent it from all leaking out when not in use ) , but since the detergent is n't pushed out in any way , it makes the wand pretty ineffectual . I had to dump all the detergent back out of the wand and use the wand by pouring detergent on the front of it and getting to the dishes . It seemed to defeat the entire process of the dispensing wand . But otherwise , the scrubbers are great , and I like the handle which helps me get to the bottom of the big pots !	-1
Nothing particularly horrible about this product , but nothing exceptional either . It did not seem an hydrating or calming as weleda products . I also did not find the aroma to be all that pleasant . The tube design is just stupid - not convenient to use or to store .	-1
I was quite disappointed in this Bay Rum after reading some many great things about it . Yes , it does burn , and burn long like the best of them do . However , the scent just is n't there . Out of the bottle , the smell is almost unpleasant , as many have said . Unfortunately , I never noticed any improvement on the skin . I think of bay rum as being spicy and heady ... this was subtle and unexciting . If you 're looking for a Bay Rum with powerful aromatics ... . keep looking .	-1
thin bristles and nearly worthless . I tossed it in the trash and bought the OXO . much better . Much much better .	-1
Thankfully , Amazon has the best customer service , and I was sent a postage-paid label , because I specifically bought this listing because it included the bucket and the lid . It came without the lid , which was useless to me . Amazon said because they have to keep these in sets , they could not just send out a list . Of course , that begs the question of how did this then come without the lid and where is the lonely lid ... but anyway , I was happy to send it back but I did not reorder .	-1
I received this item in a bundle order with a Hitachi Magic Wand Massager . It was quite fun for play , though not useful for massage.What was of concern is that the attachment had a small rip from the box , which became progressively worse with use . I do n't think I 'm going to replace it when it does n't work any more .	-1
looked soft online but it was hard plastic and caused more irritation than pleasure , unless you like hard plastic toys I would pass this one up , we threw it in the trash	-1
It tasted terrible . Not able to use it !	-1
Hubby tried it for a few weeks with no results . He mostly complained about the smell . He said he might try again one day and give it some more time to work .	-1
I purchased this worthless stuff in February and it did n't do swat for me . ( excuse my language ) Please Please Please do n't buy this misleading TV product . I 'd religiously applied this stuff three times a day for the past two months and presently every skin tag is still intact around my neck . What a ripoff ! The worst experience about this application for me is the intolerable smell which is so overwhelming and sickening . Once you done applying it , what happens in a couple of minutes is the overflowing odor . It is so toxic and strong your feel as if your 're about to fall into a sleepy spell . Again please do n't but this product . A waste of both time and money .	-1
Should return this , does n't work and it smells terrible . I have a few skin tags that I tried this product with and it did nothing .	-1
It does n't work for me . I put it on the three times a day it recommends and it does nothing .	-1
All of the different sounds basically sound the same and repeat in 2 second loops . I really wanted this for the white noise sound option , but I might has well turned my alarm clock radio to static because that 's exactly what the white noise sounds like . Not peaceful or helpful to my sleeping whatsoever . I highly discourage you from purchasing this item . There has to be a better product on the market to fit my needs . May work in a baby 's room because they do n't know any better , but if you are looking for a white noise or relaxation sound machine , look elsewhere .	-1
This is my second one of these exact machines . The first lasted 2 months . I figured it was a fluke and bought another . Again , we got only two months out of it - just long enough to be past the return deadline . I gave up and went to another sound machine I did n't like as much but that has lasted longer . This was a complete waste of money . And it was hard to tell right away that it went out because it would come on like normal . After hanging out in the baby 's room one night , I figured out it stayed on 10 minutes and then either oscillated on and off , on another sound , or stayed off completely . We did not have a happy baby . Unhappy baby means no sleep for mommy and daddy . Not a good product to not have work !	-1
To much noise could hear more interference than sound , would not recommend , had to return . Was very disturbing and disrupting during meditation	-1
Horrible Product ! ! ! Total Rip Off . This product did NOT work for me or my wife ! ! ! DO NOT BUY Best Naturals SUPER GARCINIA 1500 ( Garcinia Cambogia Extract 500 mg per ... We also got the Best Naturals # 1 Rated Garcinia Cambogia Extract Ultra Pure , 1000 mg per ... That one did work some what.But there are BETTER Garcinia Cambogia Extracts sold by AMAZON ! ! !	-1
Waste of money , I did not lose one pound dispite a strick diet and exercise program . Save your money and just watch what you eat . Gimmick !	-1
This was absolutely the worst idea I 've had in a while . It made a HUGE mess , and did n't even get the hair out even after several applications and strips . The wax cools within a minute , so it does n't even stay warm and you have to constantly reheat . Not worth the time or money .	-1
I have very coarse hair and deep roots . I have tried other products but decided to test this one . It did n't remove any of my hair and I followed all directions and used baby powder . Very disappointed ! ! ! !	-1
Poor quality control . I 'd be embarrassed to sell such a lopsided POS .	-1
The razor slides off too easily . I was not about to BEND the flat piece upward . This would have worked , but I should NOT have to do this .	-1
The stand is well made but the design needs improvement , big-time . Why it is n't made with adjustable openings so it can accommodate ALL razors & brushes is beyond me ! ! !	-1
It tastes GREAT . It works terribly . Worst practical chapstick we have ever used . Stick with their beeswax kind . That they make properly.This actually made our lips chap more .	-1
I bought these for my 90 and 91 year old parents . Medicare does n't pay for hearing aids and they are about $ 4k . I had hoped these would help . They did amplify but would n't stay in their ears . So I am returning them .	-1
I never really noticed any effect from this ; but only tried one bottle . Would not recommend it to anyone needing help with sleep or marketable effect on stress .	-1
This product seemed like placebo to me . I saw not even a slight difference in my mood . Not happy with this product .	-1
`` WARNING FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ONLY : This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm ... '' I went on the MRI website , which has a page that describes CA Prop 65 and provides many reasons why it is bad for manufacturers , but does n't specifically say why this product requires the warning . I want to know which chemicals and how much of them . Why does n't the original black powder formula have this warning ? Until MRI addresses this publicly and in a more forthright manner , this review stays 1 star and I will not be putting it in my body .	-1
Dear HeadBlade , THIS was a failure . You spent three years on developing a rolling version of a regular razor ? Then made the finger holes too small ? And somehow managed to screw the engineering so badly that if I turn the blades around so it 's a push instead of pull razor ; the only thing it manages to remove is the shaving cream ? This looks pretty , it has much nicer wheels than the cheap-o plastic ones on the sport , but that 's about it . How about you upgrade the Sport model instead of making this abomination ? That would 've been worth my $ 17 ; this is not .	-1
I 'm incredibly disappointed with this razor . I 've been a Headblader since the company was founded and have finally thrown in the towel . This razor clogs up and does not cut nearly as easy as their push razors . Pushing vs pulling is one of the things that helped set Headblade apart . Their blades have also become even more overpriced and do not last near as long as the competition . Switched over to Schick and enjoy a better , faster shave , and blades that last over twice as long .	-1
I have always shaven my bald mellon with the UP stroke with a normal razor so using the ATX was easy no learning curve , just a slightly different feel..razor handle Vs a Matchbox car ; ) The ATX has the same look basically as other Headblades Just on Steroids.. the shock ABSORBER like blade holder seems decent . I have the Sport also and have shaved `` With '' & `` Against '' the grains ... Sport for the `` Push '' and `` Pull '' with the ATX when I wanted a change from handle , change it up a little..TILL NOW ( 2 SHAVES LATER ! ! ! ! ) So here 's the negative/ downfall ... after 2 shaves the blades went completely dull . Left stubble had to touch up with my Gillette . I get about 25-30 perfect shaves with my Gillette sensor blades BEFORE REPLACING , so really disappointed and I know others have had the same issue through reviews . I also contacted HEADBLADE customer service with an issue on another purchase and after 3 weeks no reply when there reply said 24-48 hrs ... So , After years of having HEADBLADE products I will no Longer waste my money , customer service goes a long way and show your buyers a little respect/loyalty and @ least reply whether or not you can fix issue requested . So in short , stick to a normal handle shaver , better results .	-1
Not nearly as good as its predecessor . Misses large patches , needs too much pressure . Do n't buy their `` learning curve '' B.S . I 've had mine a year now and it 's garbage compared to previous models . I emailed HeadBlade to voice my concerns and was basically told that I 'm an idiot and its all my fault .	-1
Tried to use this product several times and unfortunately it just is n't as fast or accurate as the original Headblade . Even with the six-blade cartridges ! Imagine trying to mow a lawn by -pulling- the lawnmower instead of pushing it . That is exactly what this is like . Dragging the blade behind the wheels is less accurate than pushing the blade directly to shave where you need it to shave . I always ended up taking an additional five minutes touching up the places on my scalp that it missed . I gave it four shaves in hopes that I 'd get used to it . Unfortunately it just left me frustrated by the fact that when I thought I was done , I 'd run my hand over my scalp to find the stubble it missed . Then trying to pin-point that stubble with the ATX sometimes left me having to go over it three or four times before I got it . My original Headblade always got the first time.Fortunately I kept my original Headblade and will never go back to the ATX.I would only recommend this if you 're having problems cutting yourself with the original Headblade .	-1
bought this thinking it would make keeping mostly bald head easier to keep looking sharp but using a regular razor has proven more effective	-1
We use the Sinuflo , which is made by the same company as this product , all the time so when I saw this I thought I 'd give it a try . I used the recommended dose of 2 sprays in each nostril and soon my nose was cleared up but I had it dripping out of my nose and also could taste it down my throat soon after and kept feeling like my throat was constricted or I need to clear things out of it . There is a lasting burning effect too.Those things aside , it was all the warnings on the box that really got my attention and once I looked them up I decided this product was n't for me .	-1
Unless my bottle was defective , it sprays way too much gel into your nose . Two sprays is one dose and I thought it was way too much product to have up my nose . Although it did work quickly to clear my sinuses , I ca n't stand the feel of it . Plus there are many warnings on the label : do n't use if you have hypertension , heart disease , diabetes or thyroid disease ( do they mean hyper-or hypo-thyroidism which I have ? ) Also , males with prostate disease are warned to not use this .	-1
It comes in a descent sized bottle , but felt really light . So I took a peek inside only to find about 1/6 of the bottle has liquid in it . Packaging is a nightmare with plastic tightly covering the whole thing and no way to pry it away except to cut all over the place with a razor .	-1
This worked well as a decongestant . A little on the strong side , it cleared up my congestion quite well and kept me breathing freely for the full day . The downside is that there & # 8217 ; s a bit of a burning feeling that kicks in a few minutes after application . It fades away , and I would not describe it as severe . Still , that & # 8217 ; s not a side effect I & # 8217 ; ve had with other brands ( I usually get the store brand ) .While it scores well with regard to effectiveness , it does not score well with regard to packaging . The bottle comes fully encased in plastic that is a pain to remove . I & # 8217 ; m all for having tamper-resistant packaging , but this was a bit over the top . More significantly , the bottle was supposed to contain 15ml of the product . That & # 8217 ; s not much ( about an ounce ) given the size of the bottle , but the bottle felt so empty that I poured it out into a graduated cylinder to see what actually was in the bottle . The bottle contained 8.2 ml ! Given the price of the product , being shortchanged to that degree on the amount in the bottle is a huge negative.To be fair , I measured after one spray in each nostril . But I can & # 8217 ; t imagine that one spray used up more than 0.3 ml , so the total amount in the bottle could not have been more than 8.5ml . I made sure to include the amount in the feeder stem in my measurement.Better , and cheaper , choices are out there . Not recommended .	-1
This spray comes out as a very fine mist that does a good job of penetrating your sinus cavities . It 's refreshing to use and does n't sting . And it starts to work very quickly in my opinion . Like all nasal sprays that promise 12 hour relief , this falls short of that number considerably , but not less than any other . My problem with this stuff is its horrendous price . This bottle is bigger than any bottle that holds a full ounce of spray that I have ever seen . But there is only a half ounce in it . As another reviewer here took note of , the bottle feels light and practically empty . Though it being a fine mist will make it last a little longer , this is still the most expensive over the counter nasal spray I have ever encountered . If it 's effectiveness was something miraculous I might consider it worth it . But trust me , its not . You can do a lot better here on Amazon , and at your local pharmacy . Not recommended ...	-1
The bottle of NeilMed SinuFrin Decongestant nasal decongestant that I received is completely empty.The box was sealed and the bottle was shrink-wrapped . The lid was tight and the container has no obvious defects.The information from the bottom of the bottle and box is Lot SD003 2014-06.I would suggest weighing the final product as part of the quality control process .	-1
While I 'm sure this product would work like any other brand nasal spray with the same active ingredient ( of which there are many generic and name brands to choose from ) , the bottle I received was almost completely empty , to the point that the sprayer could n't even be primed . This is odd , as the box did n't show any signs of leaking , and the bottle was plastic wrapped to kingdom come with tamper-proof shrink plastic . I can only guess that they 're going for the ultimate placebo effect with this one , as sending me a huge bottle with less than an 1/8 teaspoon of liquid in it is n't going to be very useful . Sorry , but I 'd have to say avoid this one at all costs , as there seems to be bottle filling quality control issues , and you go to any local drug store or mass merchant and buy a competitor brand that costs less and gives you a full bottle .	-1
I do n't like that they sell these in a pair for wood and tile . I only need the ones for wood floor . I do n't need the Fragrance disks.Makes the whole package price ridiculous for one pad . I think if I had known this before I bought the mop , I may have reconsidered.Anyone want to swap a tile one for a wood one ? I 'll see if the Bissell site offers just the microfiber pads solo .	-1
This is a piece of junk . Got it for the wife to use in the shower , but tossed it after a week or two . Thin , low quality , and beginning to rust . I use a ~30 dollar one that was very highly rated on here and love it .	-1
I wanted to try double edge razors for a change because the multi razor blade versions offered today are so expensive . But after trying this out the angle to the skin is too sharp and is very easily able to cut the skin.The angle of the cut is very conducive of making the skin raw and exposed.I would not recommend this razor to anyone maybe the other well known brands might be of higher quality but I was not going to take that chance with 50.00 , it only took one shave to know this is not for me ...	-1
Cheep Look , Cheep Feel , The handle did not have a smooth finish as I expected . The product was damaged during shipping so I never shave with it but I was not impressed with the look and build quality . I would think a vintage used razor would be much better .	-1
Ordered this one and also ordered the Silver Tone handle from JFLY on May 6 . Got one today but not sure which one it is ? The one I got is a clam shell design and much different than the pictures show . Handle seems OK but the top is plastic , flimsy and does not look like it will last very long . The blades do not sit on the top straight and sometimes the top will not even close with a blade in it . I will update this review IF I find out this is the Silver Tone and not the Sodial . Return address is China and does not match either of the vendors that I ordered from . The only clue is that the box for this one states that it is the SL brand . Whatever that means . The one blade that came with it looks very cheap and kind of scary to use . Will wait for the other one to arrive and compare to see if I really want to use either one .	-1
I would n't know , they after 9weeks , sent me some toy razor called she mg long half plastic half alluminum ca n't use it	-1
I bought one of these razors back in 2012 it lasted me two entire years and was nice hefty metal of good quality and upon re-purchase from the same merchant the same item ( I remember b/c in order to get my original purchase it ships from overseas and purchase to doorstep takes almost a month ! ) I figured my original ( which i reviewed and gave high praise ) could use a replacement , and at a cost of $ 2 I made a repeat purchase of 3 extra ones . The three extra 's came to my door , a month later and open opening and inspecting them I found the handles to be almost identical but the upper screw in part that covers the razor to be a much lower quality , lighter , cheaper piece of flexible metal . Definitely not the same sturdy construction as the metal on the original one i purchased ( and I paid the same price then as well $ 2.00 ) Not sure what this re-seller is doing now but its definitely an inferior product . I would not buy them again . Oh and lets not forget the rust spots , two out of the three items in the repurchase had rust spots around the screw parts that connected . Do not waste your money , I retract my initial review giving high praise and would like to warn buyers ... I have since jumped to ordering a Edwin Jagger De86bl Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor , Black from amazon , I have n't received it yet but once I do and give it a chance ill be sure to review it accordingly , hopefully it will be a razor which lasts me at least 3 years or longer .	-1
This starch leaves too many flakes and slowed ironing time . Many of the bottles arrived leaking . I do not recommend this product .	-1
Amazon really needs to do something about this ! If you click on each `` reviewer '' to see their other reviews , it 's easy to see that most of them are reviewing the same products . What are the chances that 8 out of 10 people who reviewed product X also reviewed products Y and Z ? Another thing I 've noticed on reviews for these supplements is , you have to check the dates . You 'll notice several reviews posted on the same days . For example , a product may have reviews on Februray 21 and February 28 - over and over again . What are the odds ? It 's obvious that someone is sitting at home all DAY on certain days doing fake reviews.Amazon , you 've obviously got great developers working for you . Why do n't you come up with a way to rank the reviews by `` most likely to be legit '' ? All you 'd have to do is cross compare product reviews of the other reviewers for a product . If you care about your customers , you 'll do something about the fake reviews ! ! !	-1
I thought these would help make my clitoris longer and easier to hit while having sex but did not work . Ca n't get a good enough suction going . Maybe if you were built different it might work , but just not on me ... ... ... . Good luck to someone else	-1
This was a gift for a friend . Was told these fell off too easily . Gave it 2 stars for being on time in delivery .	-1
They do n't really do anything . Maybe I did something wrong , but they are n't arousing or good at making things look bigger . This was a waste of money on my part , but it was worth trying once .	-1
I am someone who tends to elevated blood pressure and also my toes happened to be too long for these socks . Unfortunately , a larger size was not available . The color is beautiful . Just wish I could have worn them out .	-1
I was excited to use this with my four year old . He has accidents almost every night . What I found was that this did n't work for him.Pros+My son was asking for his & # 34 ; buddy & # 34 ; after just a single night of using it . So he bought in.+It is easy to clean up after+It comes with quite a few stickers for the sensorCons-The battery died after the first night . Very lame.-The noise did n't wake my son up even on loud . I know this is subjective and there are other noises and vibration available but the whole point of this tool is to wake the child so their body recognizes the situation and trains itself to wake . If it does n't wake then it does n't work.-The head part is pretty big and the clip slips off all the time . ( The clip holds the face part on to clothes ) .-It did n't end bed wettingOverall , I get the idea here but for the price I really expected some measure of improvement . I did n't see it . The batteries and the clip that pops off all the time point to poor quality . If you do n't have any other options you may want to give it a shot ( I 'm gon na try again in a year or so ) . But I was n't sold . Especially considering what you get for your money . I think it 's overpriced .	-1
I was so excited to try this for my child turning 6 this weekend ; we have not had a dry night yet . She was excited to try something that might help.The alarm itself was so terrifyingly loud and impossible for a startled child to turn off , that even the thought of the Chummie induced panic.I am so glad so many have had success with this , but the fear and trauma of waking up out of a dead sleep to an alarm as loud and obnoxious as a fire alarm with bright lights that is not easy to turn off made our bed wetting difficulties even worse.So please read this review AND all the reviews that show that this does work successfully . I do believe that it could work ; it is a great idea and the fun packaging and diary made my child very excited initially to try this . We were all hopeful . But for us , this will not work making nighttime with the Chummie terrifying . So we gave up and are trying traditional techniques.At least we are pretty sure that by the time we are sending the kids off to college . In the meantime , we will hang onto the Chummie and hope that it works better if any of our younger kids have a hard time with bedwetting .	-1
The alarm is fussy to set and startlingly loud . Terrifying would be more accurate . We tried using just the vibration setting , but it was annoyingly awkward to get it set properly . You are just clicking through all the settings and hoping you land on the right one . If you click one too many times , it 's back around again . It 's also difficult for a child to turn off while half asleep . It does stay put well and goes off when it should , but the genuinely frightening alarm made it really unpleasant to use . I 'm so disappointed because I really wanted this to be our solution .	-1
Okay not as advertised . It does n't smell good , but rather smells nasty especially after a couple hours ... Other lotions may do the trick .	-1
I bought this scale based on all the rave reviews and what a piece of junk it turned out to be ! The scale itself is very attractive and I liked the large number display and how it turned on when you stepped on it , however it 's purpose is to accurately measure your weight , which this epically failed at . Every time I stepped on the scale , even within a matter of minutes , it displayed my weight as 3-4 pounds different from the reading it gave moments before in the exact same spot . Even if you moved the scale a few inches across the floor from the previous spot , it gave a weight that was drastically different . I know I did n't gain four pounds in two minutes . I bought this to help me track my weight gain , and it 's completely useless since I do n't know which weight , if any , is accurate ! RETURNED ! ! ! !	-1
Checked it w/ 3 different people having recent doc appointments . Perfectly accurate . Sleek , sturdy design and well packaged . I do n't think you can go wrong.Update : 8/1/13 my scale has started showing a 10lb weight loss overnight -- - I wish it were true , but its not . Anyone else experience this problem .	-1
I read the reviews on this scale and they all seemed really great so I decided to go for it . I have been doing a fitness regime so I have been tracking my weight daily . At first the scale worked amazingly well and was dead on with the other scale I had that it was set to replace . After a few weeks it started getting errors and than going long periods without working . I changed the batteries and it would work again for a few days and than it would start to not work again and I would have to change that batteries out . Eventually it got to the point where it started weighing me at 340+lbs when I weight around 152 . I got so frustrated after dealing with this for a few weeks that I just threw the scale out . Maybe mine was just a bad one but I would not recommend this scale , better luck to everyone else .	-1
I ordered this product for christmas for my family to replace our old non digital scale , and i thought this one looked pretty . I was right , it 's pretty , but the one i received is broken already after only being used a handful of times . I suspect that the scale was damaged in shipping or something , because the scale was poorly packed and the box for the scale was damaged ( even though the scale itself looked fine ) . Normally i would n't be angry about damage during transit , but this scale was poorly packaged . There was no foam or anything to hold this scale in place , it was n't protected at all . It 's a GLASS scale , it should be protected better ! Nevertheless , it worked fine ... AT FIRST.After about a week it started acting up . First , it started to give false weights . I weigh 135 pounds , and the scale was telling me i weighed in at 178 . I moved the scale to another room with a different kind of tile , the scale said i was 156 . Weird how i gained 50 pounds , then lost 20 pounds so quickly ! After the scale started giving misreads , it eventually just stopped turning on at all . Now it 's just a glass paperweight . I 've changed the batteries , i 've tried EVERYTHING . I give up .	-1
Had high hopes , but the accuracy is usually off 95 % of the time . It started off great , only had to weigh myself twice at times to make sure it was right , but started failing after only two months & that was even after infrequent use . Sometimes it calculates anywhere between 15-20 pounds less than my actual weight . Would 've given it 1 star but I like the overall look of the product , however the silver portion you see in the image is a cheap feeling plastic.Invest in a better quality product !	-1
I have owned this scale and fought with the constant weight fluctuations that it gives me in just ONE READING . I step on the scale and get three different weights . I hate this scale . I really do . When I get a chance I will be buying a new scale . I will probably go back to the Weight watchers scale . It worked and I never had to worry about these constant fluctuations . # dontbuy	-1
I am usually a pretty cynical person and follow the old adage & # 34 ; If it 's too good to be true , it probably is. & # 34 ; So why in a moment of weakness did I give in a purchase this product ? I do n't know . It was an ad ( another face*palm ) in Oxygen mag . My thinking was like this : Hmm .. I need to get up before 6am and workout again . Hmm .. this will help me sleep . Hmm .. burn fat while I sleep .. great idea ! Well - that is about the only thing this product did for me . Took two tablets at night until the bottle was gone . I was already eating OK and working out somewhat consistently ( thus the goal of wanting to return to 6am workouts .. more consistency . ) No inches lost , no pounds lost . But I was sleeping better.Unrelated - I also purchased Melatonin at the same time ... and lo-and-behold , that works just as well for sleep as Z-Burn , at a fraction of the price.Save your money ( from this VERIFIED purchase from a REAL reviewer ! )	-1
Statistics : Female , mid-20s , 5'3 & # 34 ; , 118-120lbsGoals : Lose stubborn belly fatI finished the whole bottle , but I have had no effects and results . I feel like I 'm just taking capsules of nothing.It might just be me where these diet pills do n't work on me . I 've tried many diet pills , but I 've never had any effects or results . Here is a list of other pills that I have tried : - Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite-Svetol Green Coffee Bean Extract Formula , 100ct ( This gave me energy when taking one pill , but it only lasted a week . After a week , I had no effects from it . If I took two pills , I would feel nauseated and run to the restroom to throw up in the middle of my workout , so I had to stop using this half way . Of course , no results at all . ) - Saffron Extract- Appetite Suppressant | 100 % Pure Premium Saffron Extract | 88.5mg - 90 Veggie Capsules ( Finished the whole bottle . No effects and no results . ) - NatureWise UltraPure GCA Green Coffee Bean Extract Made With 100 % Pure GCA , 90 Veggie Caps ( Finished the whole bottle .

Tsk tsk tsk ! When it comes to a highly rated product , I like to check the accounts of reviewers to see if they are mule accounts or are actual shoppers of Amazon.Unfortunately , a good portion of the reviews on here belong to accounts that have only reviewed this and nothing else ! Even some of the verified purchases on here are fake reviews ! I 've even found some accounts that `` reviewed '' this product that posted an exact identical copy on another product that is likely manufactured by the same company . I found too many mule accounts in the reviews to trust this product.Any company that resorts to such dirty and deceptive tactics to push their product gets an automatic one star from me . I wo n't comment on the efficacy of the product , clearly there are some users here that have used it with success and others that did not . But if a company has to lie about the efficacy of their product to get you to use it , I 'd assume the worst about the product .	-1
I just ca n't recommend this charger and batteries . The quality of the charger does not appear very good , and after reading the reviews , I returned it .	-1
So I purchase this and used it exactly as described with absolutely no results at all . I 'm not `` big '' or anything mind you since I have never had children and very few partners , I was just looking to tighten things up a bit . Well , I followed the instructions exactly and had no change at all whatsoever . I also tried leaving it in for much longer as well as moving it around etc to try to get more contact . Nothing I did changed anything . So , I leave my review stating the above and then the seller contacts me and tells me if I remove my review , they will refund me . The seller did refund me after I removed my review . The thing is , that is really ridiculous because the fact is , it DID N'T work for me . I wonder how many negative product reviews this product would have if the seller did n't force people to remove their review . I had originally gave this 3 stars because I believe it worked for other people . Now I wonder how many of the good reviews are just friends of the the seller since they like to manipulate the true ratings . That is why I am giving this 1 star now .	-1
This product not lubricant comparing to Tailor Of Old Bond Street shaving creambut the smell is very goodperhaps this product not working for me because i using Muhle R41 DE safety razor which is very aggressivedo n't know but this shave cream just not work for me	-1
it was delivered promptly etc . i have only tried it a couple of days and have n't noticed any effect whatsoever . if i eventually notice something i 'll send another review .	-1
Does n't do anything . Especially for the price I was expecting results . Increased stamina , recovery , etc . Nada . Stay away from anything that is n't prescription and claims to be an Adaptagen . Joe Rogan talks a good game but he does't know what he 's talking about . Save your money .	-1
I have bought several Tweezerman tweezers and they ALL break hairs ! That is ... those hairs these tweezers actually can grip . Far too many hairs slide through them.I 'm flabbergasted . I keep reading about how wonderful they are ... well , not for me . I have about six `` granny hairs '' - coarse beard hair that older women sprout . I 'm NOT going around sporting six beard hairs on my chin ! I have a few thin hairs on my upper lip that are a bit dark - these tweezers break those , too . Tweezerman breaks my hairs FAR more often than the much cheaper Revlon tweezer I bought - the Revlon is slanted and has rounded corners . THAT is the best tweezer I ever used . It never breaks hairs and easily accomplishes a firm grip.http : //www.amazon.com/Revlon-Tweezer-Slanted-Tip/dp/B001B8K1L8/ref=sr_1_4 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1397325896 & sr ; =8-4 & keywords ; =revlon+tweezer	-1
This is a product no one should have to buy ... Pentax should have tossed it in with a $ 500+ camera and while they were at it , made a swivel LCD . Better to score an extra battery because they run out fast but the 4-AA run out faster .	-1
I do take probiotics , but I also have a pretty healthy digestive system ( vegan and get plenty of grains ) . I was kinda leery of taking another brand . It took ages to find one that I love ( Nature 's Bounty ) . The problems I had with finding a good brand was stomach cramping and gas & # 8211 ; sorry to say that Nutrigold has done what former brands have done . I did n't want to give up , sometimes it takes a bit of use for the body to acclimate itself . But I could n't take it anymore after two days . My stomach was severely bloated.I ca n't recommended these .	-1
I have been using probiotics for a year now , trying different brands to find the best for me . Before using Nutrigold I used Ultimate Flora . Nutrigold does not seem to work as well as UF for me .	-1
I 've been taking Digestive Advantage brand probiotics for a few years now and they 're great for me . My stomach feels noticeably more settled when I take them regularly.I wanted to try out these Nutrigold probiotics , so I stopped taking my Digestive Advantage capsules and switched to Nutrigold caplets for a few weeks . I 'm not really sure if they 're doing anything for me . My stomach seems to get upset as often as it does when I do n't take any probiotics . Switching back to my old pills fixed things for me.While these probiotics do n't really work for me , they might work for you . I had to do a bit of trial and error before I found a brand that worked very well with my stomach .	-1
It is not rechargeable ! It uses a standard A312 air-zinc hearing aid battery . As far as the & # 34 ; high quality & # 34 ; part goes , that also remains to be seen . As soon as I saw that it only uses regular batteries , it went back into the box . I was getting this for my 90+ year-old mother who has arthritis and ca n't handle the little batteries . She needs something that can plug into a docking station for recharging - - this item is definitely not it .	-1
I bought these for my Dad . He liked this better than his $ 2 , 000 hearing aid . He really liked the rechargeable battery . Unfortunately , the earpiece fell off a couple of days after he started using it . I was able to return with no issues .	-1
These batteries are not very good . One was DOA , and the other does n't hold a charge long at all . I seriously doubt the 1200mAh claim . Amazon support is great and refunded my order , but I would n't even bother buying these .	-1
very disappointed did n't work for me at all ! @ even purchased a 2nd bottle thinkin ok well maybeif I give it some more time i 'll start losing ! nope works good as a laxative but thats it if anything I feel as though I 've gained weightso disappointed thought this was the product for me	-1
Did just as directions said and after using 1 bottle gain of 2 lbs . Sorry I wish it worked , Keep searchin for that miracle fat burnin pill its not this .	-1

Still looking for the perfect rehargeable water flosser ... this one worked okay , good not great pressure , for a few weeks then died the way of all flossers ( so far ) .	-1
Does n't floss . I 've had other water flossers , this one is a waste of time and money . I do not recommend this product at all .	-1
This device is a little complicated to use . Though the actual use is easy , obtaining accurate results is a bit more complicated . The screen is large and the buttons are easily understood , but changes in placement of the device and arm/wrist positioning significantly impact the readings . I 've obtained readings which were both extremely high and extremely low using this device.I may be picky because I was a nurse for seven years , but I do n't really care for the monitor . I want something that is consistently accurate , and this is n't the device for that .	-1
Need Iron , these did not contain it and so I became anemic during my pregnancy for a short time until I started taking Iron again .	-1
These are great ! They taste good , are jam packed w/good tasting vitamin stuff..Im not pregnant , but my dr suggested taking these for a while.They seem to be working out very well !	-1
I have given this product a few months to work and I see absolutely no difference in my body whatsoever . Maybe it works on some people but it just did not work on me . I bought 2 bottles so as to give it a few months to see if it would do something ... but no . At least I tried .	-1
I 'll contact the seller , seriously- 5 min ! I am so disappointed . Hopefully a fluke , we shall see . It 's not like it was expensive , but still ... ...	-1
this does nothing for me . who made this and why ? do not buy . seriously . not even worth to continue reading reviews for .	-1
I have Raynauds in the hands and was hoping this roller would make them more comfortable but it did not . I have arthritis in my hands , so running the unit over the knuckles is n't very comfortable .	-1
I was so excited to try these after reading many good reviews . Unfortunately they did not meet our expectations at all . I put them in my daughter 's canvas tennis shoes and they were so tight that it took the both of us working together for 5 minutes per shoe to get each one to even go on her foot . I asked her to wear them around the house to see if they would loosen up , but after a couple minutes she was in too much pain to continue wearing them.NOTE : I see in another person 's review that she was also using them in canvas Chuck Taylor shoes and had the same issue we did . I am wondering if this is only an issue with canvas & # 34 ; soft & # 34 ; shoes and not typical leather tennis/running shoes . I will try them in leather runnung shoes this weekend and come back and update . In the meantime , use caution when purchasing for use with soft sided shoes ! On a positive note , they seem very sturdy and well made . I hope they work in a different pir of shoes !	-1
Omega 7s are supposed to help the mucous membranes , but even though , this particular product got good reviews ( somewhere ) , I will buy my Omega 7 's in capsule form from now on.This liquid is extremely acidic on the mucous membranes of the mouth , and that 's not good for me , as this causes dryness and sore spots , even when diluted with juices . I forced myself to use it up , but not daily as I could n't tolerate it . I think I 'll just throw the rest of it down the drain , as a matter of fact .	-1
I tried this for my hair and skin and it works , but it 's gross . I gave it 2 stars , ( thought about giving it 3 stars ) , because of the false advertisement , ( in my opinion ) . The product information states 'tastes great ' . Definitely a matter of opinion.Nonetheless there is a product that I DO enjoy and works the same way , keeping my skin and hair nourished and that 's Sibu Beauty Revitalize Liquid Supplement Drink . This is more palatable and offers the same health benefits . Check it out .	-1
I have the Coccyx condition and really wanted this to help . It does , but only a little . First , this thing slides on my leather car seat WAY too much . It also raises me in the seat too much . The leather seated orthopedic chair at home is also difficult to use with this as it slides too much . It seems too thick and does not depress enough . I weigh around 210 lbs . I tried to find the spot where the discomfort is greatly minimized ; as that is the reason i got this . I simply could not find it . I got 2 of these and both are going back .	-1
I am plus size and felt like I just smooshed it down and it did n't offer much support or relief . I kept it cuz after a week of sitting on it the darn think looked flat . I weight less then 250lbs .	-1
I did not like this Aylio Coccyx Orthopedic foam Seat Cushion . I purchased it to help my back and my thighs that I was feeling pain . Tried it twice and slipped forward both times five minutes after using it . I feel this can be dangerous and harmful to me . I would not recommend this pillow .	-1
Material is soft enough , but it 's small so it does n't cover the entire seat so the edges bit into my legs.Might be perfect if it were bigger .	-1
The cover is does n't fit the foam and was constantly unzipping it and repositioning the foam only to have it slide out of place the next time I sit down . Within a week the 2 '' middle seem simply unravelled with no damage to the fabric . It would be easy for even me to sew , but what 's the point ? I gave up on the cover and am using a king sized pillow case instead.The foam itself feels great and I wish I would have purchased a cushion sooner , in fact I 'm going to buy a 2nd one for another chair , just not this brand.Given the excellent reviews I 'm guessing mine is an isolated problem , but I 'd feel really stupid getting burnt by the same company twice .	-1
I had hopes this would make sitting in a transport wheelchair a bit more comfortable but it is more an opposite . My pain is actually worse when I use this and the material is quite slippery which adds to the discomfort . I really ca n't recommended this product .	-1
Returned because it flattened down like a pan cake . My butt bones hit the hard surface below.5'2 & # 34 ; , 145 lbs	-1
Can not understand WHY there is no seat cushion under $ 100 or more $ made that does not hit under your thighs and cut off circulation + major discomfort . This thing has a cover stitched so thick , and I use a footrest which elevates my legs , sits me up straight so am not hanging off my ligaments , immediate discomfort . Also , imo , this cushion is too small for even an average size person with average office chair . I would NEVER place a wheelchair patient on this thing . Lots of positive reviews here ; decidedly , I disagree .	-1
Philips Norelco PQ208/40 Travel Electric RazorI bought this shaver because I stupidly broke my Remington while trying to clean it . I saw shavers with much better reviews than for this Philips Norelco , but I could n't see spending the prices they demanded . Anyway , after trying this shaver -- once was enough -- I came back to Amazon looking for a shaver that would shave ( this Norelco definitely does n't ) . Anyway , I had decided upon a $ 40+ Remington because it had NO one or two-star reviews , but I first tried once again to fix my broken Remington . This time I succeeded in fixing it , and now I 'll probably be using this Norelco for a paper weight . I might add that I 'm seventy-six , and I have have owned many electric shavers in my life , but I never found a Norelco that was satisfactory . Remingtons yes , but Norelcos no . That may be simply a matter of personal preference , but that 's been my experience . Anyway , I was unable to get a good shave with this Philips Norelco . I might have , if I had persisted , but my face was starting to feel raw , so I did n't want to continue .	-1
I was so disappointed with this product . When I first opened the package , I noticed that the white pen had already leaked a little . I started using the blue pen and then when I tried to apply the white one , it just leaked down the side of my pen . I could get a little on the tip , so I applied that to my teeth and cleaned off the pen where it had leaked out.I used these for a consecutive week and I could tell that my teeth were getting whiter . However , the white pen continued to leak worse and worse and ended up getting completely stuck to my bathroom counter . If this product had worked as stated , I would have really enjoyed it . Maybe I can give it another try to see if the next pen I get leaks .	-1
There is supposed to be gel in these pens that when you twist the bottom comes out so you can put it on your teeth . I must 've twisted the thing for twenty minutes - no gel . I have used a product similar to this before with no trouble . I thought maybe it acted differently and the gel just was n't as visible as it is in the other product so I tried painting teeth anyway and did taste something , so used as instructed - with no results . I do n't know , the pens still seem to be empty to me . If they 're not what little is coming out ( maybe it 's just that not enough came out of the pen ) is not working at all .	-1
Okay , I tried it for five days . It did n't live up to its advertised hype.First of all , it 's tastes pretty bad . It did seem to brighten my teeth a little bit ; enough to be barely noticeable . And it is more convenient than using trays or strips . You brush it on and go . That earns it the extra star.But you sure do n't get much product for the money ; the afore-mentioned bad taste ; and the lack of any appreciable effect are all negatives .	-1
Decided to try this product out . Not that I have yeller teeth and coffee stains..but we all want whiter teeth . Its a first world problem that we dont.You click the pens till the product is on the brush , the Blue pen is first ... its some sort of pre whitening protectant potassium whatevers . It smells wierd . The white is peroxide..and its all gel like and clumpy..and doesnt `` paint '' on like you think it will . used for 8 days . no big difference at all , just my disgust at how gross and terrible this product is .	-1
It took me about 40 turns on the pen to get the protective gel to finally come out and then it basically all come out at once in one giant clump . Not sure if that 's supposed to happen but when you only have a small amount to last you 10 applications . I did n't have that problem with the whitening gel though . It was fun seeing little bubbles after both applications , kind of like peroxide on a cut . I tend to have very sensitive teeth but did n't have a problem using Prime Time Teeth Whitening but after 5 days I did n't notice any change in teeth color .	-1
The concept of the Prime Time Smile Dual Action teeth Whitening kit is a greta one . Instead of strips that are hard to position , and may not provide proper coverage for all kinds of teeth , this set comes as two wands which you are to paint on your teeth . Love the idea , especailly since it means you can get at the inside back teeth . But this is a two wand system and you are to paint one substance on before the other . That would be ok if the gel came out smoothly , or at all . No amount of turning as instructed go both wands to work reliably at the same time . Of course your mileage may vary	-1
This product requires a two-step process : First you apply the & # 34 ; whitening booster & # 34 ; in the blue pen ; then you spread on the & # 34 ; whitening gel & # 34 ; in the white pen . It 's easy enough : You rotate the applicator to draw the gel up into the brush , and then paint it on . The whitening gel has a nice minty taste ; the other is tasteless . When used once in the morning and then in the evening , the manufacturer claims you may see a difference in three days . However , I have been using this system for a few weeks and have not seen any visible change in the whiteness of my teeth . Therefore , I do n't think it 's really worth what you pay for it -- especially considering there are other , more effective options available .	-1
On the 'plus side , ' using the Prime Time product does not require fiddling with strips which tend to take on a life of their own , or a two-hour period where one must have a sense of having swallowed tape . However , for effectiveness it must be used twice daily , and remain on the teeth for half an hour . Quite an amount of time and cost would be required to use this product regularly.The packaging is not reliable . Using the two tubes of solutions requires twisting until each solution saturates the brush , as one might with a concealer , and one of the tubes fell apart the first time it was used . The directions are unclear . One must 'brush but not floss ' before time , and then leave the two layers on for half an hour - but whether one should then rinse is not mentioned.Though this may not be universal , I noticed that , with using it over time , it caused sensitivity in my teeth , particularly to heat and cold . I have never had sensitive teeth , and therefore believe a correlation is likely.The product did seem to achieve noticeable whitening within a week or so , but I discontinued use for fear of aggravating the sensitivity mentioned . I can see its being a bothersome and costly product to use .	-1
Nope , it does n't work . It tastes bad , I feel myself trying not to gag or swallow directly after using it . Blah blah blah , this does n't work . For anyone who has wasted money on whitening strips or trays , or any of these mediocre mid- priced products ... . you get what you pay for . It is best to just save up and pay for actual teeth whitening from a dentist . The prices are going down every year .	-1
I used this as instructed for 5 days and did notice a slight improvement in my Diet Coke stained teeth becoming a bit less yellow . Still , I do not have a `` Prime Time Smile '' as I see on my friends who get professional whitening from their dentist ( and they pay about $ 300 for the honor ) . As other reviewers have noted , it takes forever to start the product flowing the first time you use it . Yes , the blue stuff comes out as a clump , but I just used the little clump and spread it on my teeth using the brush . the white stuff seemed to continue to leak out even after I used it on about the 2nd day so that it leaked in the lid and the next time I opened it there was a sticky mess . the white stuff ran out after 4 days , however I also had an extra box of 2 more whitening pens so I opened one of those and started using it . So far it has n't leaked after 2 days of using it . I am on day 7 now , but did skip a day in there as I got a little fed up with the process . Still since I seem to still have some goo left in the blue pen and almost 2 full white pens ( from my other box ) , I figured I will keep using it until the product runs out . I will report back if my teeth end up becoming `` Prime Time '' white once they are used up . ever the optimist , I 'm still hopeful these will save me from forking over $ 300 to the dentist so that I can get some `` pearly whites . '' As of now , though , the best I can tell is this is worth the one star review .	-1
Since they were advertising this as an alternative to trays , I was looking forward to trying this teeth whitening system . When I first opened it , I had to sit there cranking away on the twist-bottom for quite a while before any gel appeared in the brush . I was disappointed to see that it then requires being on the teeth for a half hour ... Primarily because I feel like I ca n't close my mouth while I have the gel on my teeth ( I do n't want my lips to push the whitening gel off my teeth ) . I still feel like the trays or strips are easier to use . I 've also noticed no changes in my teeth ... Certainly not noticeably whiter !	-1
What I like about this product : - primer is good , I used similar one from Gosmile but the packaging was terrible . Pen works great , similar consistency.- painful , I did n't experience any pain on teeth or gums , - seems to work but..What is bad ; - the whitening pen is a mess : took forever to have any product out , - whitening gel is goopy , thick , hard to evenly distribute , - after 3 days ( 6 applications only on my top teeth there is no more product.For the price this is outrageous . Not sure if I had defective pen or this the way it works . I had zoom years back and I use whitening pens , they just refresh the color ( I drink coffee and vine ) . Products like that wo n't change yellow teeth to sparkling whites , you need to go to a dentist for a professional whitening . There might be a slight difference , depends on the person but I can not recommend this product . After 3 days my teeth seems more shiny but definitely there was no significant change .	-1
I very much liked that this was a simple brush-on-and-forget-it kind of product . It was much easier in that sense to use than trays or strips ( strips always tend to come off or move around ) . It was certainly cheaper than a pro treatment . However , there are significant drawbacks with this product . One is it 's very difficult to know if you are putting too much or too little product on your teeth because there 's really no way to gauge that . Consequently , I am on my third day of treatment and have already thrown the kit away because I have used up all the whitener . I was under the impression that the product was enough for 5 days of treatments , since the package enumerates that amount of time for the full effect . So , I doubt that I will get the full effect . My teeth are marginally whiter . All the time I used this , though , I worried that the product was coming off quite quickly and easily . With nothing to hold it in place , I would think that the natural process of salivation probably quickly gets rid of most of the product . Sadly , I can not recommend this one .	-1
I was skeptical about this whitener after I had ordered it once I read more about it online . I used it for a week and saw no changes in the color of my teef.Unfortunately , I can not recommend it as a whitener . I 'll be looking for the old Crest I had used , which seemed to do the trick .	-1
I did n't expect this to taste great , but it was worse than I expected . Smells gross ! And after faithfully following the directions , my teeth do n't seem much whiter.I get better results brushing with nice and scrubby baking soda .	-1
This product was not effective for me . The whitening pen ran out after 4 applications . I do believe it was dried out . The gel was very thick and hard to spread on my teeth . I had to turn the dial around 4 times before anything came out . I noticed no whitening happening during the four applications . This product was a complete failure for me .	-1
Although I enjoy the easiness these pens provide , I 'm not sold on their overall effectiveness . I used it for a week straight , but the color of my teeth did n't improve all that much . A week does n't sound like a long time , except this product is supposed to work wonders in as little as one day even ( let alone 5-7 ) . I 'm a serious soda drinker , & I 'm not talking the clear stuff either , so naturally I 've tried teeth-whitening before because , despite brushing twice a day , it 's going to take a toll . I love the idea , which is definitely the quickest solution by far ( compared to trays or strips ) . And maybe I would 've seen better results in my trial had the # 2 pen not leaked during shipment , which is where the actual whitening comes into play . It was extremely sticky & difficult to open the first time , so I 'm a bit concerned that I had more pre-treatment than anything else . It 's true that you have to twist a long time for the ( clear ) contents to rise , but at least it seems that a little goes a long way . However , I stopped using it once I noticed that it hurts to brush my teeth now . The bristles feel like they 're scratching my gums , & the toothpaste feels like it 's burning the inside of my mouth . It 's been twice as long of discontinued use , yet I 'm still experiencing discomfort in that regard : (	-1
When I got these , the tubes seemed empty . I twisted the first tube for ages , and I was pretty convinced they were empty . I put them down on my vanity . The next night , I picked it up again and twisted some more , to check before throwing them out . A little bit of gel finally came out . I painted it on my teeth , and picked up the second pen . I seriously twisted for far too long - these things are apparently nearly empty of product . FInally , an extremely thick , gloopy paste came out . It was not easy to try to paint onto my teeth . It was clinging to the brush as though it 's life depended on it . I finally got some on , but I was worried my teeth were going to bleach unevenly . The taste is unpleasant , and I noticed my lips had a white film on them from the hydrogen peroxide , and I had hydrogen peroxide on my hand as well . Keeping this stuff on my teeth for 30 minutes was not going to be easy . I ended up giving up and just brushing it off my teeth because I could n't stand the taste . The pens then went right in the garbage . Whitestrips are so much easier !	-1
I used this product twice a day for about a week - not the recommended 10 days of a full treatment , but long enough to get an idea of how it worked . Perhaps it whitened some , but I was distracted by the fact that it felt really harsh on my gums and the corners of my mouth ( no idea how it even got on that area ) . It also caused some tooth sensitivity for me - enough that I decided to discontinue use . This may be good for people with less sensitive mouths , but it does n't work well enough to warrant use for me .	-1
I did n't notice much of a difference . I would be lucky if they are one shade whiter . It also made my teeth hurt . I have used other similar whiteners without sensitivity . I gave it two stars for ease of application . It works better if you dry your teeth before applying .	-1
This was my first Whitening attempt . The directions seemed clear enough but as the treatment days passed , I discovered that I had a lot of product left when the tube should have been used up . I did n't continue with the 2nd treatment tube because I was finding each day the irritation and dryness of lips , mouth and throat were lasting longer and becoming more uncomfortable .	-1
My weight is about 85kg . First time a step on it it shows 150kg and turn to EEEE . I reinstall the battery and it works for only one day . Today the reading jumped from 87kg to 95kg in two tests . Do n't purchase this item , it 's totally a waste of money .	-1
Got this fast and Started using it right away . i started juicing the day i got it so i was excited to see how much id lose . But Id weigh myself every AM and on day 2 it said i had lost 14 pounds ! ! So i stepped off and waited for it to turn off . stepped back on and it said id lost 21 pounds ! ( dont i wish ) got off and back on and it said i gained 2 pounds ! ! I have tried different flat surfaces of my house and nothing helps it will go up and down in either way up to 30 pounds within 5 minutes ! I would strongly recommend a different scale !	-1
scale is ok no back light so it is hard to see the readout also takes forever to lock into the weight readout . Sometime you can stand there for 1-2 min before it finally locks in on the number.I have had othr scales and all though it works I would not buy it again or recommend it	-1
I ca n't believe all the good reviews on this scale . The only good news is that it looks nice . But a digital scale should not be giving you a different number every time you step on it , up to 3 pounds difference ! ! Even a mechanical spring scale does better than this . This is not a good deal .	-1
Since this product is the only game in town it 's better than nothing . The drug is good and can be fast acting if taken up the nose but the atomizer is very finicky and has to be cleaned EVERY day and with vinegar three times a week , also for best results store it with the mouth piece pointing up or the medicine will leek out .	-1
The price is good , however , each of the virals that came in the box where not even half full ! Had to use two or three virals to get the same effect . Doubtful if I will again purchase this sight unseen .	-1
Did n't seem to do anything one way or the other . I have been taking them with the pretty optimistic hope that I would notice a change in my mood or change in anything really . But , they do n't seem to do anything .	-1
This is usually a good brand name and mixed with Olay I was really excited about getting this razor . But I found it to be very disappointing as it did not remove the hair from my legs completely . The head swiffled too much but I did like the foaming Olay lotion which usually does not come with regular razors . I am not sure why it did not work as I did make sure the head was on the way the directions specified . Yet I did not get a close shave and had to use another razor . I also shave the hair under my chin every day and it did not work there either . I really was looking forward to having this be my new brand of razor but it did not work out . If anyone has any other experiences I would hope it worked for you . Kind of sad about it .	-1
I already have a Venus razor , and I was really exited to try this scented variety . The problem is that the scent is n't strong enough , and the lubricating strips kind of just dissolve and fall off . It still shaves really well , but if you depend on those strips for skin protection you 're out of luck . I 'm going to use the handle with my regular Venus cartridges . It was a nice idea as a novelty , but with the strips disintegrating and virtually none of the promised scent , I do n't think this product is worth it .	-1
I used to use 2 blade disposables . This razor gives me about as good a shave as a 2 blade disposable for a much higher price . It does not shave as well as the fusion power razor nor as well as the Schick Hydro 5 disposable . Save your money	-1
I tried this razor , and yes it does shave close . Yes , it gives a smooth shave . The issue is the cost of the blades . The replacement blades are right at $ 4 a blade . I am simply not going to spend $ 4 per blade for razor blades . Remington has a five blade razor , and the blades come in at $ 1.65 per cartridge , well under half what the Gillette Fusion blades cost . I have been exceptionally pleased with the Remington razor , and at half the cost on blades , I will stick with that one . I find the quality of the shave to be equivalent between the two razors . ( Remington King of Shaves Azor 5 Blade Manual Men 's Razor with 3 Cartridges )	-1
Although this product looks interesting , it works terribly.The idea behind this razor is that it vibrates , which is supposed to create a better shave . The problem is , it absolutely does n't create a better shave . The handle vibration shakes and numbs your skin , which makes it difficult to tell whether you are shaving too hard or or too close to the skin.Furthermore , the vibrations made it slightly difficult to shave straight . Additionally , the blade is very firm and does not bend in any way . It feels very unforgiving . So , although the shaving gel was removed by the razor , not all of the hair formerly under the gel was gone ( as I figured out later that day ) . Halfway through my shave I immediately went back to my Schick Xtreme3 disposable razors.On top of all this , the replacement cartridges are , apparently , pretty expensive.I would not waste my time on this product . It seems to me a gimmick that I recommend avoiding .	-1
So far I think I like the non-power model better . I am not happy this does not come with a holder like the non-power unit came with . My shaving experience is not as good either . With the manual I can feel and hear that hair is being removed . I will give the power unit more uses , but because I think the blades of the non-power unit blades last longer for me I 'll try that blade with the power unit . If I get no improvement I 'll go back to the standard non-power unit , or use the power unit in the off position . I 'm really annoyed about not getting a holder . I need one for storage and travel .	-1
I wondered about how this might be a great razor at the time I ordered it . The fact is , I was ultimately dissapointed.I suppose the idea is that the battery-powered vibration will chop off the stubble close to the skin . It does this in all the places which are easy to get to but in those troublesome curves , I ended up having to use my old stand-by disposable razor to finish shaving.While this razor might be okay for a lady to shave her legs , ( and I would n't swear to that ) , I found it to be lacking for shaving one 's face . I think we 'll be seeing lots of these razors at a discount price at the Big Lots stores in the not-so-far future .	-1
These feathers are very sharp , but they are not for me . I tried a sample pack and while I could n't feel myself being cut while shaving I definitely noticed the nicks and blood lol . Got the stubble off a little to well for me , but may work just perfect for you-every face and everyone & # 8217 ; s technique is different .	-1
This brush did n't work very well for us . I got it to clean our 24 oz . Aquasana bottles but it 's not flexible . Also , the spongy bits do n't really turn spongy in water , they stay stiff . So I 'm keeping it , I guess , but I have n't really used it and do n't plan to . I do have a decanter and will try it out on that next time I use that .	-1
This is worthless , unless you want to blow out an eardrum when you speak . It does nothing to amplify what you want to hear like the tv or someone talking across the room , but , when you talk , it will blow your eardrum .	-1
I bought this for my husband because I talk very softly and he 's constantly saying & # 34 ; huh & # 34 ; , which drives me crazy.. Anyone who has a soft voice knows what I 'm saying.. If you talk soft naturally it 's very hard to talk loudly.. It 's kind of exhausting.. Anyhoo , I bought this as a test , because it was cheap , to see if he would even like using it.. He tried it for several days , but really does n't care for it.. He said , for example , if we 're watching tv , it makes it louder , but when I say something , he ca n't hear me at all over the tv.. If he wears it in the store , it 's pulling too much noise in , making it impossible for him to hear me talk ... You 're suppose to be able to use this in either ear , but it 's really designed for the left ear and does n't fit well in the right ear.. I wish it had worked but it 's mostly just sitting on the desk being ignored.. I 'm glad we did n't buy the really expensive one.. This is a good price to use as a test to see if it will work like you want it to..	-1
bad do n't work only static can be heard can not watch TV because you wont listen to whats being said about	-1
I was n't able to get the garcinia cambogia brand that was working for me and thought I would try this brand . It DOES NOT work . You need to have 60 % HCA in each capsule . Do n't waste your money ! ! ! !	-1
Took as directed , but did not loose a single pound or an inch..Will not buy again and can not recomend it	-1
I ca n't say I can tell any effects at all as far as appetite control . I exercise but have n't lost a pound have the same appetite . I gave it two stars because I have only taken it two weeks .	-1
Do not see any difference in appetite at all . No other effect evident either -- guess there is n't much point in taking them .	-1
I am a female who is 5'3 & # 34 ; tall and weight between 118-120lbs . I am only trying to lose my stubborn belly fat and some extra arm fat.I took the capsules as recommended on the bottle . I had no effects after taking the capsules , and it did n't help me with getting any type of results . It felt like I was taking capsules of nothing.It might just be me where these diet pills do n't work on me . I 've tried many diet pills , but I 've never had any effects or results . Here is a list of other pills that I have tried : - Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite-Svetol Green Coffee Bean Extract Formula , 100ct ( This gave me energy when taking one pill , but it only lasted a week . After a week , I had no effects from it . If I took two pills , I would feel nauseated and run to the restroom to throw up in the middle of my workout , so I had to stop using this half way . Of course , no results at all . ) - Saffron Extract- Appetite Suppressant | 100 % Pure Premium Saffron Extract | 88.5mg - 90 Veggie Capsules ( Finished the whole bottle . No effects and no results . ) - NatureWise UltraPure GCA Green Coffee Bean Extract Made With 100 % Pure GCA , 90 Veggie Caps ( Finished the whole bottle . No effects and no results . ) - Garcinia Lean 500mg : Garcinia Cambogia 180 Capsules ( Just started this bottle last week . Hoping this will really help me lose my stubborn stomach fat . ) - Muscle Pharm Shred Matrix ( Finished the whole bottle . No effects and no results . ) I will not buy this again since I did not have any effects/results .	-1
I have been using the standard Finish Powerball dishwasher tablets for years . I have a Bosch dishwasher , and the Finish tablets work the best . I do not like the Finish Quantum . They leave a film on my dishes that the Finish Powerball tablets do not . The Quantum tablets work great removing the food and dirt , but they leave a film . I 'll stick with the less expensive Finish Powerball tablets .	-1
When using the Finish Powerball packs , my dishes were clean . Not any different than what I normally use , but still , they were clean.The lemon fragrance was subtle , I did n't notice it as strong at all , which I liked . I would catch a gentle lemony whiff when I open the dishwasher at the end of the cycle , and it did n't last on the dishes when put away.About nine out of ten times , these Finish detergent packs dissolved just fine , but once in a while , I find one half dissolved & hanging out of my dispenser at the end of the cycle.I do n't see the need for added bleach , yuck . And as for results , the coffee stains in my husband 's mugs were the same after using this Finish product with bleach , as my usual powder that has no bleach.I also do not understand the packaging , for several reasons . It was a huge pain to open this box ! The plastic container that comes out of the cardboard box does n't fit under my sink because it has to lie flat . Also , the plastic container is specially designed to only give you 25 packs , when it could have been done as a regular plastic box shape using the same amount of space , which would fit 30 packs , making the packaging more efficient . I think people would be willing to pay just a little bit more for those 5 extra packs and not have the weird box.With results being the same as my regular powder detergent , plus the strange packaging , I was not impressed with this Finish product . For a similar price point , I prefer theFinish Gelpacs Dishwasher Detergent , Fresh Scent , 32-Count , if I 'm going to buy individual detergent packs .	-1
Gaspari should have stuck with the original formula and maybe just changed what protein types were in it , if he felt the need to do so . And not added a big no no to this . The Probiotic series is nasty garbarge . This Elite series is complete garbage ( there 's something in it that makes it complete garbage ... yep , this is the big no no I referred to ) as you find out later in the review as to why I think so or you can skip to the last paragraph now and find out . I bought a 2 lb . container of the Strawberries and Cream flavor and did so because I loved the original Myofusion Strawberries and Cream so much . Big mistake ! VALUE : First off , I paid $ 35 for a 2 lb . container with 26 scoops at 25g of protein per scoop and that 's the cheapest price I could find anywhere and this was about 5 or 6 days ago . Normally , I would n't pay that much for a 2 pound container of protein , but I just had to try this stuff . I kind of wish I had n't . If you take two scoops a day this will last you less than 2 weeks . That 's some pricey protein ! Value gets a 2 out of 10.TASTE : I ca n't comment on the other flavors , but the Strawberries and Cream flavor is not very good . I 'd give the flavor a 6 out of 10 . It 's doable , but that 's about it . A lot of people say tastes does n't matter ... . to that I say bull crap . Tastes does matter ! If does n't , then I 've some nice piles of dog doo in back yard I 'll let you snack on and I 'm guessing it would n't be very tasty . Joking aside , when I drink a protein shake I actually like to enjoy it . I look at it this way : If you have the option to buy a protein that tastes great and is of high quality , then why buy a bad tasting one . There are plenty of high quality tasty protein powders out there . This Strawberry flavor is not even close to the original Myofusion Strawberry flavor . It tasted awesome ! This one not so much . It does taste slightly better in milk than water.MIXABILITY : Had no issues here . Mixed each scoop with 8 ounces of milk or water ( just like it recommends ) and the consistency was fine either way with no clumping . I used both types of liquid in shaker ball cup and a regular shaker cup and , again , no issues with either cup . I ca n't comment on mixing it in a glass ( who does that anyway ! ) FYI , I shook it for about 20 seconds . So , a 10 out of 10 here.QUALITY : Myofusion seems to put high quality protein in their products . This blend contains a combination of slow , medium , and fast proteins ( whey protein concentrate , milk protein isolate , whey protein isolate , and micellar casein listed in that order on the label ) Now , if what I 've read is true , then there probably is n't a lot of whey isolate or micellar casein in it . From what I 've read , the proteins listed furtherest ( is that a word ? ) from the first contain the smallest amount . Also , I would like to know how the isolate was processed . Was it ultra cold-filtered ? Since Gaspari does n't disclose this we may never know . It is also gluten free , synthetic color free , and is supposedly abundant in BCAA 's . It says on the ingredient label that it contains Taurine . Again , how much ? At least Gaspari disclosed how much Leucine , Isoleucine and Valine are in each serving ( about 2 grams , 1.2 grams and 1.2 grams respectively ) Pretty decent there . Okay , before I give my rating on quality , let me tell you about my main gripe ( it 's a big'un ) with this protein , aside from taste ... .I did n't know this prior to buying it b/c I had not read any reviews on it , but as soon as I read the ingredient label I saw it contain PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED SOYBEAN OIL . That is not a good thing , especially for a protein . PHSO is essentially trans fat and is quite bad for you because it sticks to the walls of your arteries and will possibly eventually lead to heart problems . After I discovered this idiotic ingredient I checked online reviews to see if anyone else had beef with this and sure enough a bunch of people have complained about it . Why would you put that in there Gaspari ? Oh wait , I know ! You gave a lame excuse that was so lame I do n't even remember what it was , but you can easily find it online . To be honest , really healthy people , like myself , can use this with the PHSO in it and it probably will not affect them much ( at least not in the short term ) , though I would n't recommend it . But for unhealthy people this is a big no no . Might as well go fill up on Kit Kat bars . They certainly taste better.So , my rating for quality for this is , yep , you guessed it , a big fat goose egg 0 out of 10 . I definitely will not be buying anymore of it . I probably will finish off this container because I really hate to waste money . So , I guess you could say all the other previous catergories I rated are a nonissue b/c of this . I had to rate the other catergories so it would be a complete review and not a review of one major issue.My recommendation is that you avoid this stuff and buy something tastier and healthier or wait for Gaspari to recall this stuff and `` fix it '' . I just ca n't give this a good review knowing it 's got PHSO in it , which is terribly bad for you . But if your health and well being are not important to you ( they should be ! ) then go for it . There 's nothing ELITE about Gaspari 's new Myofusion , sadly : (	-1
Did n't seen worth the shipping costs and hassle to fix this , but one of them arrived with holes at the bend . As others mentioned , not the easiest to clean either . The RSVP steel straws with no bend are dishwasher safe and much less hassle all around .	-1
Wish I could give no stars.Forever comfy ? Maybe comfy the first few times you use it . After a short few days , you will notice a distinct butt impression where your keister sat as well as a distinct flatness where your legs rested . There is n't any fluffing it back up either.Waste of money ! Do n't spend your $ 20 . In fact , even if they drop the price on this , do n't buy it .	-1
This cushion is less than one week old . It was placed on a lawn chair used for reading in the back yard . It was OK the first day . Today it is squished down and providing very little comfort . The user of this cushion is a 155 lb woman who used it sparingly.For one thing , it is too small . The width is fine , but if it 's placed at the back of the chair , it does n't support the thighs . If it 's placed closer to the front of the chair , the rear end is left hanging . It ca n't be turned the other way because than both `` cheeks '' hang off either side . It 's almost comical , except that this thing costs a lot of money.It flattens like a pancake . There 's no support . This is what I get for not reading Amazon reviews before buying .	-1
I have not seen this advertised on TV and had never heard of it until I just happened to see it at Walmart today when I was in the bedding department . The office chair that I use at home is no longer comfortable because the padding in the seat has apparently become compressed , and it hurts my butt ( which has no padding ) , so I bought this cushion . It is like sitting on a slab of concrete , and I will be returning it to Walmart for a refund .	-1
I bout this at the Big Box Store cause i did n't want to go through the buy one get one free thing so many complained about , and I 'm glad I did . At first I 'll say it felt great , about 10 minutes later , well , you may as well be sitting on a bag of sand , it bottoms out in other words . So got it home and unzipped to inspect , all I can say is CHEAP , CHEAP , CHEAP.Three layers of CHEAP . Well , lesson learned , I should have checked out the ratings here on Amazon first.For all you guys in wheelchairs looking for a descent inexpensive cushion , all I can say is you get what you pay for , and I HIGHLY DO NOT recommend this as an alternative , Amazon has far better for just a few bucks more .	-1
Wish I could give it no stars or even a minus . Bought this thinking it would help my back after back surgery . Instead it made the pain worse . Tried it for a week . First day I thought I had just slept wrong . Second day , I could not sit comfortably and tried to convince myself that I had pulled a muscle or something . Third day , I began to suspect it was the cushion as it was the only thing different . Fourth day , I removed the cushion from my office chair . So much pain I could hardly walk . Fifth day , I noticed an improvement in my pain level . Sixth day , almost no pain . No cushion either . Seventh day , woke up pain free instead of waking because of the pain . Do n't waste your money . THIS IS NOT COMFY ! ! ! ! !	-1
Like many & # 34 ; as seen on tv & # 34 ; products , this product is overpriced , over sold , and does n't do what it claims . I used this for 4 days after I opened it on Christmas day and I 'm throwing it out . At first , it was comfy as the ad says , but it quickly collapsed into a worthless , flat and cheap piece of foam .	-1
I oftentimes will give a 3* review until I 've tested a product . I slept with this last night and did n't find it particularly comfortable , but I imagine that it just takes some getting used to . It also has that slightly toxic foam smell which hopefully will go away soon . It 'd be nice if they 'd design a bit of a indentation in the pillow for the head . I 'll update for better or worse at some point in the near future.4/11/14I returned this item last week and changed the rating to a 2* Hated sleeping on it . Very uncomfortable , poorly designed , and does n't take into account the actual human body .	-1
I purchased this for my husband with GERD . Unfortunately , the wedge just did n't work out for him.PROS : Seems to be solidly constructed , not cheap feeling . The fabric is soft ( we did n't place a cover over it ) and zips on/off . I have not tried putting it through the washer yet . The memory foam is cushy , but not too soft that he sunk into it.CONS : Even though for this particular sized wedge the incline is only about 16 degrees , my husband ( who is 150lbs ) , kept sliding down . By morning , only his shoulders and head were on the wedge , which defeats the purpose . He 's also a back sleeper , but occasionally lies on his side . He reported hip discomfort when lying on his side with this wedge . He still wakes up with reflux sore throats so it really did n't improve his symptoms with this product at all.As a personal observation , the width was fine for him because he 's a slim guy . Many people suffering with GERD or sleep apnea , however , tend to be overweight or obese . I just ca n't see a larger person being able to move left or right very much at all or finding enough support in the foam for their weight , IMHO .	-1
When I opened the package , I was greeted with a tag in large letters warning that this urethane foam pillow is highly flammable . It went on to say that once ignited , it would be very hard to extinguish , even with water . And the fumes could be toxic.Then I was greeted with a strong , irritating and noxious odor . After airing out for several days I thought I 'd give it a try . The odor never disapeared completely , and weeks later when I rolled over on it I 'd get an unpleasant whiff that would sometimes wake me up.The pillow did tilt me up so my sinuses drained better and it was a little easier to breath at night . However , the tilt vectored the weight of my upper body down along my spine and onto my lower back and hips . They became painful and sore as the night progressed , and in every position my back and legs would become painful enough to wake me up.I gave it a couple of weeks , but my sleep ( and the pain ) only got worse . If it helped me sleep I 'd still be unhappy because of it 's flammability and nauseating smell.It arrived in a highly compressed form held tight by plastic wrap . There 's no way to compress it back and return it , so now I 'm stuck with a stinky , ugly , and useless pillow . And I do n't want it around because of its flammability . Maybe I can cut it up and throw it away in stages ... .	-1

I have taken as directed for over two months and noticed no difference . I do n't know if I would recommend this or if my metabolism is just dead and cant be awakened by this .	-1
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! ! Been taking for a month now .I bought 2 different name brands one for myself & one for a friend & they both did nothing for either one of us . I exercise & eat right & thought this would make a difference to add & it made no difference . Save your money & stay with old fashion hard work & diet . If it sounds to good to be true it most always is . This one is ! !	-1
Completely useless . Did not see one bit of difference . Will not be using nor recommending to anyone . Complete waste of money for me .	-1

What do all diet products have in common ? Lots of fake reviews . This one is no exception . There 's only one Amazon verified purchase in all the 5-star reviews . All of the other ones contain review histories of only this item and other items from the same company . Make sure you check ( click `` see all my reviews '' ) on each positive comment just to be sure .	-1
I bought into all the hype and purchased this . Upon receiving , I checked to contents and I always and discovered there is an undisclosed amount of alcohol in these drops.I do n't drink , never have . I do run a machine at work that have 3 razor sharp blades in it that will cut your finger off if you look at them wrong.Glad I read the ingredients before I put this in my body and went to work.Amazon did n't seem to even care and the seller says the alcohol is there to help the drops get absorbed faster . I do n't care why it is there , all I care about is the listing still says nothing about the alcohol months later . My purchase was made in April , 2013 and there is still no mention of the alcohol . Not even in any of the reviews .	-1
I 'd give the product 0 stars if I could.Firstly , there is no such thing as a raspberry `` ketone '' . The so-called `` ketone '' is nothing more than a naturally occurring phenol compound that is found in many other fruits and vegetables , including cranberries , onions , blackberries , etc . I 'll try to be short in explaining this scam.The research that supports `` raspberry ketones '' was performed on rats ... .RATS . These rats were fed an extremely high-fat diet for weeks and then given raspberry ketones with a high-fat diet for weeks . In short , the rats supposed lost `` belly fat '' .What the study does NOT tell you is that 1 ) the rats were given daily doses of RKs that equalled close to 2 % of their body weight . I 'm a 220 pound man , so for me , we 're talking about eating 4 and half POUNDS of RKs per day . 2 ) Rats do not metabolize fats the same way that humans do . 3 ) Most of the calories that human convert into stored body fat come from excess refined carbohydrates and sugars , not a high fat diet . 4 ) There is no way the rats ate close to 2 % of their body weight in RKs and also consumed the same high fat diet that they did before RKs were introduced to the experiments . 5 ) Stress hormones caused the fat loss in the rats , not RKs.There is not ONE STUDY , not ONE that even remotely suggests that RKs work in humans . Know why ... because the research has never been done . I do n't know how else to say that it 's a scam . The product will never , ever work.Some agents that will `` support '' fat loss ? Guarana , Yerba Mate , ECGC from green tea , R alpha-lipoic acid , Coleus Forskolin , Cissus quandrangularis , and African Mango extract . NONE OF THEM WILL WORK WITHOUT AN EXERCISE PROGRAM AND REDUCING CALORIC EXPENDITURE . If one does not force the body to use more calories that are consumed in the diet , NO PILL will stimulate weight loss.There are no short cuts . Take one step toward your body and it will take two steps toward you . I should also mention that all of the `` wonderful reviews '' on here are fake . You go to these sites to purchase , and you get a nice discount on a future purchase with the company if you come here and give a rave review . Many supplement companies really do this . You 'll find those same individuals have never reviewed anything else here . I know ... .sad.Hope this helps .	-1
Sure did n't work for me . Made my Gillette Fusion blade worse , not better.I 'll try it again when the new blade starts to get dull , and if it does work I 'll update this review . But I 'm not holding my breath .	-1
Save your money and just rub your razor across the mirror you look at when you shave . There 's absolutely nothing special about this product . No angle guide , no special type of glass , nothing . I saw no difference in the sharpness or longevity of my Mach 5 blades .	-1
Literally stinks and every time I wash clothes or cloth diapers in this they smell like funk or poop . It 's just gross . Back to tide I go . This was my second time purchasing and will be my last .	-1
Well , it does roll on easy . I 'd say the rest of my experience was awful , but that does n't begin to describe it . I 'll stick with epel , it 's a whole lot less painful , actually removes hair and not skin , no sticky mess to clean up , and my skin is n't red for days after . I do n't know how people use this , or why .	-1
I so wanted this to work . : /I have been professionally waxed , but have never waxed before , and I find the professional waxing really not worth the bother - the place I visit is not convenient , and with my work schedule it 's generally hard to plan ahead . Being able to just block out a bit of time in my bathroom would have been wonderful.Unfortunately , after two tries I have managed to remove a grand total of 19 hairs from my leg.Because I was optimistically hoping to be evaluate regrowth rates , I decided to shave the left as usual and go the waxing route on the right . The first time I tried it , I think the wax may not have gotten hot enough even though I let it warm for 50 minutes . It spread , but I barely removed anything - I got four hairs that time . I counted.I did some reading on various `` how to '' internet sites , and thought perhaps I did n't pull off the paper quickly enough . Some people say that 's a problem for home waxing . But just in case the problem was that my week-old growth was too short , I gave it another half a week . This time I tried powdering the leg first , as the instructions say that powder may help the wax stick better to the hair , less to the skin . I let the wax warm for an hour and 15 minutes . It flowed more smoothly , so that may be a better heating time , and the paper ( of which I think there 's an inadequate supply ) stuck much better . I mentally prepared myself and pulled as low and as fast as I could . Although I got more hair this time , it was a barely noticeable difference in the leg . All total , that session I caught 15 more hairs . And the wax left me a sticky mess . ( The wax removal wipes do work , but I think there 's an inadequate supply of those as well . Baby oil does seem to work . ) I was planning to give it a third go , but there really were n't enough of the strips left for me to finish the job even if I did . Maybe I lack the facility , maybe the wax is off , I do n't know . I only know that my days of home waxing are over . It 's back to the razor for me.Oh , and be careful - I had a really hard time even inserting the wax stick into the warmer . It was very difficult to insert , and when I did I managed to catch a bubble of skin on my finger . It 's been two weeks since that happened , and the resultant blister is not entirely healed .	-1
Most of us have dated one or two losers , maybe more . You know from the start they 're bad news , and of course you get burned , but for just a little while you live a little dangerously with the `` bad boy '' . This VEET product is not like that . This roll-on waxing system is more like the boyfriend you have high hopes for . Maybe you can build a relationship , maybe he 's even The One . But then there are little problems here and there that you deny at first ; you keep trying -- your hopes are so high -- but after a while you realize you are MAINLY dealing with problems . How did it all go so wrong ? THAT 'S what this VEET product was like.I so wanted to like it . I 've used other VEET products to good purpose . I love the concept of a roll-on , and heated , too . It sounds convenient , elegant , quick ... . But it is none of those things . First problem : according to the directions you 're supposed to put the wax bar into the big deodorant-shaped holder and plug the device in for 30 minutes while the wax gets heated . Yikes ! I 'm distractable ! Who knows where I 'll wander off to in 30 minutes ? So you have to plan ahead -- plug it in 30 minutes before you want to shave ... No , that 's not true . After 30 minutes I could n't get any wax to roll out . The instructions say that if it does n't roll out easily , wait another 10-20 minutes . Really ? What if I actually had a date ? So plug it in about an hour before you want to shave , just to be safe ... No , not quite . I waited over 1-1/2 hours before I could get any to roll out . I thought I 'd try my leg first since it 's a large area that can be hidden if things go horribly wrong . When it finally did roll out , it was n't a warm sooting liquid , it was excruciating ! It hurt going on , it was SO sticky it was pulling at my skin as I moved the roller , and it was n't pleasant . I used one of the 12 included strips . ( Do they say it 's 24 because you can use the reverse side ? ) But not all the hair came up , even though it was the recommended length.This was such a horrible experience that I decided it could n't be right , and I did n't want to give a bad review without really giving it a chance . The second time I heated it up for an hour , then tried it on the underside of my arm from the wrist to the elbow . The wax went on but was still super-sticky and pulled painfully , so I waited another 20 minutes and tried it on my other leg . Same problems as before.I so wanted this to be a good product , but it was very unpleasant and then did n't work very well either . Just like my first husband.I love the idea , and hope this product will be modified .	-1
I 've used several different at home waxing kits . I 've used Nad 's ( did n't like ) , Sally Hansen ( total waste of money ) , and Poetic Wax ( which can be messy but did work fairly well ) Bliss Poetic Waxing Kit . When I read the description of the new Veet Easy Wax roll on I was very hopeful that this could be exactly what I wanted.To begin with , the new Veet product takes waaaay longer to heat the wax then what the directions say , and it would have been better if you could use it while plugged in , but the cord is to short . At least it was for me for where I need to plug it in , and where I was using it ( I 'm not an acrobat ) . I would plan on spending between 1.5-2 hours warming the wax before using ( maybe longer ) . So after waiting forever for it to be usable , unplugging to use it , then plugging in again to reheat again so that I could reapply , repeat repeat ... .it was a vicious cycle and it took way longer than I have time for especially considering that it only removed about 25 % of the hair in the area I was attempting to wax ( my lower leg ) . If I 'm going to spend that much time doing hair removal it better be closer to 100 % effective.The idea of it was good , but the execution of this product is n't well thought out . When I did get it to work , it only removed about 25 % of the hair . There were n't enough strips included in the kit to do the job . I wonder if they even tested this with real people.As I said before I 've used a variety of home waxing systems and been disappointed each time . This experience was no different . A big dud . I will say however that the clean up wipes worked great . I do n't know if they sell these separately or not , but they should . That 's the only thing in this kit that would be worth buying again . I would have actually given this one star , but I like the clean up wipes enough that they got their own star : )	-1
I have a moderate amount of experience with waxing , electrolysis , and epilation as methods of hair removal . I have never tried self-waxing , though , and if this Veet Easy Wax Roll On Kit is any indication of the standards one can expect from these types of products , I believe I 'll stick to professional waxing , thank you very much.It takes a good half hour to get the wax melted using their roll on device . The stand that it sits on while melting is rather flimsy . Once the wax is ready to use it goes on smoothly and easily . But the device cools quickly , causing the wax to reharden . This kit came with just 12 strips , which is really not enough , particularly if you need to rewax to pick up stray hairs . After you are done waxing you have to use one of their `` finishing pads '' to get the remaining wax off . There were only 5 such pads in my kit , again , not enough.It 's a lot for time-consuming fuss and bother to do something an epilator can do more efficiently and cheaper .	-1
I have never waxed my legs or bikini area , I have been satisfied using a razor since I was 12 . I am not a hairy gal , so I never felt the pull to wax ( pun intended ) . I decided to give this kit a try , cause I thought that waxing could cut down on how many times I had to shave . Good razors are really expensive ! ! The directions are not easy to follow at all . The wax itself is supposed to heat up in 30 minutes , it took an hour..and then some . The kit is supposed to have 24 strips , it had about 12 . I had let my hair grow out for a week and a half , enough for any wax to grab a hold of . This kit did not work , let me put it this way ... ..If a forest has 100 trees and someone is paid to go cut down all of them and only goes in there and cuts down 20 ... Job not done . I am firing some lumberjacks . I did everything it asked me to do , and this did not remove my hair ! ! The Veet wipes used to wipe off the wax residue also didnt work good enough , I used every one of them and they still left traces . I had mentioned before that they only gave me 12 strips , and there was not enough to do both legs . I was left with areas that were completely undone , and other that were deforested only partially . I then shaved my legs old school , and I was smooth once more ! This kit is just one not hot mess , waste of money and time .	-1
Easy wax roll kit ? Not so sure . This was really not easy to use and just created a mess . Not worth the effort or the time .	-1
Prologue : Having never waxed before , I was eager to test this out . I 'm no dummy , so figured I could do this pretty easily , although perhaps not at a pro-waxer 's level . Oh , how innocent I was.Chapter 1 : I have tried , on three separate occasions , to use Veet 's so-called `` EasyWax '' kit , but it has tried , and then pushed way past the threshold of , my patience . The single , largest problem is in heating the wax . To put it simply , it does n't work . The directions ( which are n't that all that helpful , I might add ) say to plug it in for thirty minutes , with the possible addition of ten to twenty more minutes , for a total of fifty minutes . Well that was n't hot enough to get it to roll smoothly . I did n't have the time to wait longer.Chapter 2 : On the next occasion I let it heat for an hour and a half , checking on it periodically . Still no go.Chapter 3 : On the third try , I left it on for THREE HOURS ! ! ! Did the wax finally roll smoothly ? No , it did not . While I did attempt to wax during this trial , the results were dismal , probably due to the wax not being hot enough . So there goes Veet 's claim that it keeps the wax at the right temperature and it 's simple and easy to use . Ha ! It may have ripped out three hairs ( maybe ) and left my skin sticky and irritated . Yeah , thanks for nothing . Luckily the Perfect Finish Wipes work well and I was able to clean myself up easily . What do I have to do next , leave it on for five hours ? Ten ? ! Well I honestly doubt I 'll give this another go , it 's just not worth the irritation . Three strikes and you 're out , Veet ! Epilogue : I ended up shaving .	-1
Let me start by stating that I have been self-waxing for over three years . I know what I 'm doing with this stuff . I usually use Surgi-Wax for Bikini , Body and Legs , but thought I 've give this a go . The heated applicator had me intrigued.I intensely dislike this product ! The applicator takes F O R E V E R to heat up . I do n't have 45 minutes to wait for my wax to be ready ! The strips are hard to use and when you DO get them off , they do n't take off nearly enough hair.I use an electric candle warmer for my Surgi-Wax , so trips back and forth to the microwave and not an issue for me . This is one of those things that seems like such a great idea in theory , but in practice it just is n't ... well ... practical !	-1
I tried this product on three separate occasions as the box says you might have to wax a few times to become proficient at it . The wax took an hour to warm up enough to roll on , and then it was hard to roll on an even layer . When one a the few strips was applied it pulled just a few hairs off and I was really disappointed . I ended up having to shave anyway and my skin felt really irritated from all the fuss . I love the idea of this product , but unfortunately it just does n't work .	-1
Disclaimer - I typically use hard wax , although I have used strips , but the lack of microwave has left me warming the container on a coffee mug heating pad to melt . So , this seemed like it would be a wonderful product . It is easy to use - plug the wax roll in , plug the unit in the wall , and a half hour later it is ready to use , it stayed ready as well . I would simply plug it in after I applied it . It does roll on fairly easily , especially compared to jar products , which I really appreciated . However , it never stuck well enough to the strips to actually pull out hairs effectively and efficiently . Perhaps better strips would help , but honestly , I think the formula of this wax has been tweaked to make it roll on , and something just is not working . I found it took more than double my normal wax time and left a ridiculous amount of hairs behind . I had to follow up a day later with my usual kitSurgi-wax Brazilian Waxing Kit For Private Parts , 4-Ounce Boxes ( Pack of 3 ) , and the hairs came right out . YMMV , but I am very disappointed in this promising product . I really wanted it to work .	-1
Getting my legs waxed at a professional salon would cost me $ 60 every 4-6 weeks , or possibly more because it seems like my leg hairs grow back extremely quickly . I 've experimented with a few inexpensive at-home waxes that I occasionally pull out from under the sink to try again when I 'm not feeling like shaving . When I read the product description for Veet Easy Wax , I thought , `` Great ! This should be simple and straightforward to use . '' Unfortunately , it appears the wrong directions are listed on this site , so I want to make sure you all know what exactly you will be getting . This easy wax system requires you to plug in the device , which warms the wax . You then roll it on the area to be waxed , and remove it with the strip . Because of that confusion , I have reported it and hope Amazon changes it.PREPPINGThe wax roll on kit comes with one cartridge of wax only ( refills for this are currently $ 10.69 on Amazon ) , and it is 1.76 oz . To heat it up , you place it inside of the electrical warmer and plug it into your outlet . A red light goes on , and that indicates it 's now warming up your wax . You leave the cap on while it is warming up . It 's recommended that your hair be between 1/2 and 1/5 inches long , and that you may want to lightly powder your skin before applying the wax.THE WAXIt takes longer than 30 minutes for the wax to heat up . At 40 minutes , I decided to try it but wish I had let it heat a little bit longer . As recommended , I rolled the wax onto a piece of paper first to test if it evenly applied . It did n't , which is why I let it warm up for the additional 10 minutes . I tested again on a piece of paper and still it did n't apply evenly . I decided perhaps it might work better when rolled over my legs . Inside of the cartridge , the wax is Veet pink . When rolled onto my skin , it turns clear and I could hardly make out where I was supposed to press the hair removal strip . I followed the directions and rubbed firmly in the direction of hair growth and then quickly pulled off the strip . To my disappointment , only a few hairs actually were removed ; I had patchy results and most of the wax was still stuck onto my skin . If I do decide to try this wax again , I will see if I have different results when using a powder . Once you wax a place , you are n't supposed to do it again , even if hair still remains.THE STRIPSThe box clearly states that it comes with 24 strips , but it only came with 12.THE PERFECT FINISH WIPESThe wax kit ( if you choose to continue using it ) should provide you with several waxing sessions , but there are only four Perfect Finish wipes . I wish it came with more , since this is the only part of the kit that actually does what it is supposed to . However , baby oil works just as well at removing the wax.FINAL IMPRESSIONSI 'm not new to waxing . I 've usedNad 's No-Heat Hair Removal Gel , 6 oz ( 170 g ) ( sticky , but gentle on sensitive skin and does n't require any prep time ) , Roll On Milk and Honey Wax Women Wax by Nair , 5.7 Ounce ( rolls on evenly , but I still had too many unremoved patches ; it also cleans off skin very easily ) , and now this Veet kit . After having a horrible experience withVeet Cold Wax Strips Face , 20 Wax Strips and 4 Wipes , ( Pack of 2 ) , I should have known to not even bother with their body wax . Do not waste your money on this product . I wish I had the perfect wax to recommend to you in its place , but I have n't come across it yet . I 'm still optimistic , though !	-1
I was really excited to try this at-home waxing kit . The concept seems great -- a small portable wax system that you can roll on . However , when I used it to wax my legs , I had some difficulties . First of all , it took a really long time for the wax to warm up enough to roll on ( about 45 minutes ) . Once I started rolling it on , I made some mistakes by putting too much on at once . My suggestion would be to apply it and remove it in small amounts in a very organized manner . This , of course , was user error . Once I got going however , I realized I had to apply and reapply the wax to the same section at least two times to remove all the hair . This is either because the wax did n't grab enough or was n't warm enough . I went through the wax removal sheets provided really really quickly and could have used at least twice as much ( and this was just for one leg . ) This means that you really ca n't rely on the paper provided kit -- you 'll need to purchase it independently and get a lot of it . To see if the results lasted longer , I shaved one leg and waxed the other . I found that the waxed leg did n't stay smoother that much longer than the shaved leg ( I was expecting to be `` hair free '' for a few weeks or so ) . With the expense of the waxing system vs. using razor , I did n't find the Veet system to be that much more effective . I also thought it might be hard to wax underarms by yourself -- help might be required . I 'm going to try the system again and see if it works better the second or third time around but my initial enthusiasm was dampened . At this point , I 'm not sure I would recommend the product but I do plan on trying it for longer periods of time to see if it works better as I get used to it .	-1
I 'm so disappointed in this system ! I followed all the instructions ( both times I tried it ) and it just does n't work well enough to justify the too high price.It says to let the wax warm up for a half hour and if it 's not warm enough to roll smoothly on a piece of paper let if warm a little longer until it rolls easily on the paper . Problem is , it NEVER rolls smoothly on paper ! I let it warm up for about an hour and a half or so the first time and just decided that 's as good as it 's gon na get.I rolled it on about a quarter of the lower part of one leg to give it a try . I had even let the hair grow out so it was the appropriate length according to the instructions ( up to half inch ! ) . It was SO hard to keep myself from just shaving during showers while trying to let the hair grow . LOL ! Ok , so I put the wax on my leg which was a bit difficult , considering it did n't roll smoothly . By the way , the whole time I was doing ALL of this it was plugged in . So , I have the wax on my leg . I took one of the pieces of fabric and put it on , rubbing it for a couple of minutes . I grabbed the part I had left free so I could pull , on the top of the strip , and ripped it off . There really was n't very much hair on the strip ! I did n't quite understand why they wanted you to pull IN the direction of hair growth so for the next pull I rubbed the strip again so it was adhered well and pulled from the bottom . I had a strip FULL of hair that time ! Yay ! I would imaging if you 've never waxed or used an epilator it would be painful but I 've used an epilator for a long time , just never let the hair grow that long before doing it with the epilator.Alright , the kit was supposed to come with 24 of the strips , it came with 12 . Directions said you could turn the strip over and use the other side so after 2 good rips I had to turn it over . I went through 8 strips just doing one leg ! The instructions did n't say you had to throw them away so I put them in the washer with hot water that night . I ended up with a ball of fabric . LMAO ! *note to self - not reuseable*I gave up , did n't have enough to do the other leg anyway . I found out just a couple of days later that the hair got broken off more than pulled out . I wo n't buy any replacement strips and the kit is trash !	-1
I got this to review through the amazon vine program . I was excited to have a heating wax system that would make it easier to put wax on uniformly when waxing . I thought this looked like a great idea.The instructions for this are absolutely atrocious . I mean most of it is self-explanatory , but there are absolutely no instructions on how to put the wax cartridge into the heating unit . I think I figured it out , but who knows if it is actually in there right.There are no indicators on the unit to let you know that it is on and heating , there are also no indicators to let you know if the wax has reached the desired temp . So basically I plugged it in and felt that it seemed to be getting warm . So I left it sit for 30 minutes or so and then came back to try it out.It 's pretty much impossible to get the roller started , I ended up pushing the roller around with my fingers until it was covered with wax and would grab my skin . This resulted in my fingers getting all goopy with wax ... which was really obnoxious . The roller part also is n't heated , so the wax cools on the roller and gets all sticky and gloppy.The wax in this thing really pulled on your skin hard to turn the roller . It was very hard to roll on , the wax is incredibly tacky and just would not roll on smoothly . It ended up going on my legs as a streaky and uneven mess.A body wax cartridge is included ( there are apparently bikini wax cartridges as well , but this did n't include one of those ) . There are also cloth strips included.I have waxed numerous times before and know the procedure : place wax down in direction of hair , rub cloth strip down in direction of hair , quickly peel off against hair direction . I did this on my leg and it was a disaster . The wax pulled on skin painfully and left my leg red and swollen , but none of the hair pulled off . It was like the wax actually adhered better to my skin than my hair . To make matters worse the next morning I had a blotchy bruising where I did this on my leg that still has n't healed . This is all a bit bizarre I have never had a waxing product do this before.Just absolutely the worst waxing product I have ever used . I recommendParissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips Face and Bikini 16 Strip ( s ) andSally Hansen Salon Sugar Wax Hair Remover Kit for Face . Both of these products work better for removing hair on face and legs than this horrible kit .	-1
This is just way too much set-up and work for waxing . I was glad to get a chance to try it out , but I wo n't be buying the refills for this unit and I will be donating to unit to Goodwill . I am a veteran at-home waxer , and I really prefer the simplicity of the wax that you heat in the microwave , apply , then remove WITHOUT strips . This kit just made the whole process far too complicated for me . It also took For.Ev.Er . to heat up !	-1
We have tried this three times now before writing a review to see if maybe it was the waxer and not the wax . It took over an our to heat up . The wax pulls when it goes on but we expected that . Put the strips on , worked them in , and only got a bit of hair . We thought maybe the hair was too short . We tried it on his back , his leg , his arm , my leg , my arm ... we still were unable to get a good clean spot . The concept is great . We are not sure if it is the type of wax . The type of paper but it seems like it should work . It doesn't.You definitely need more strips because they will run out very quickly ! The Perfect Finish Wipes are great too but there are not enough . The wax is very sticky ( which is why I thought it was going to work well ) and without these you will never get that sticky feeling off .	-1
I was excited to try this at home waxing system . Professional waxing is expensive and I am always looking to extend the frequency of appointments . I was completely dissapointed by this product at every step of the process.Let 's start by getting the wax ready . The instructions ( the all to brief and incomplete instructions ) tell you to hieat the wax for 30 minutes . At that point it should , ideally , be hot enough for even application . After an jour of heating I was still to getting an even application . The wax looks pin ur , when applied to the skin , it is almost translucent and it is hard to determine the location , thickness , or anything about the wax.The kit mentions that it includes 24 wax strips . Yeah , no . It has 12 . Even though the box says 24 , it only includes 12.Next , the actual ripping off the hair . What a let down . I used this system on my legs . Ley me illustrate the epic fail of this product with numbers . I have average hair growth on my legs . The wax removed 29 hairs per strip . Really ? ! 29 hairs ? In one long area . The front air of my leg . That is less than 20 % of the hairs . On subsequent tries I had even worse results . One strip had 8 hairs in it . After using this my legs look at if I had done nothing at all . I had to shave afterwards.Pain level ? Less than ripping out a bandage . Which , makes sense since you are barely removing any hair ! The applicator cools down rather quickly , less than 10 minutes ( supposed to be 15 ) thereby prolonging the entire process . I had to plug it in again to heat it up to & # 34 ; finish & # 34 ; the other leg.Redeeming qualities ? The finishing wipes are excellent.Conclusion . Stay away . My legs look exactly the same , minus an avegare of 80 hairs per leg .	-1
After using this a few times I must say that I am highly disappointed . It never gave me the results I was hoping to achieve and I know I followed the directions thoroughly . It takes at least 30minutes to heat up and you must leave it plugged in while using it so the wax can stay hot . That 's about the only good thing about this is that no batteries are required . It comes with the waxing strips which you must cut into smaller strips for more use and the finishing wipes for after use which by the way worked pretty well . The wax roller did not glide smooth and no hair was hardly took off . I will just stick to razors or clippers .	-1
The Veet Easy Wax Electrical Roll on Kit is an excellent dream . But that is all it is ; a dream for instant hair removal.First off , I am a brunette and have very coarse hair . I first tried this product on my legs . Aside from it being quite painful , the hair was not removed . In order for the wax to actually catch the hairs , I would have to go weeks without shaving my legs . And that is just not feasible.Facial hair ? Forget about it.Armpit hair ? No way would I even think about not shaving there for weeks.Veet advertises that the wax is easily heated ; not true . It took way longer than the few minutes touted on the package . Once the wax was finally heated , it was easy to put on my legs . It was getting it off of my legs that was tough . It was painful and very very sticky . I ca n't bring myself to try it again.I just ca n't recommend this product.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine	-1
I had high hopes for this . It appears to be a convenient and mess free way to home wax . This kit has the idea right but in reality , the applicator is terrible . It did not roll on smooth for me no matter how long I heated it up for . The wax did not adhere to my clean skin well enough to pull out the hair consistently . I know how to wax myself and I followed the directions and was rewarded with a 20 % hair removal . That 's not enough for me to want to keep using this product . The included clean up wipes worked great , however ! ! !	-1
I have used all kinds of hair removal products , including professional waxing and laser , and many others at home . This product was such a joke . I threw it straight in the trash after trying to use it.The way this is supposed to work is as follows : Plug in heater , heat up wax.Roll wax on to desired area ( this one only comes with a leg/body application , I guess a different sized applicator is needed for other areas ) .Apply paper.Tear off.Repeat.I tried waxing my underarms and legs . It states the hair must be at least 1/6 of an inch long , and no more than 1/2 in . Mine fell between those parameters certainly ( underarm , I 'd guess about 3/8 . Leg 1/6 ) , but I 'd guess it pulled maybe 4 hairs out . The hairs it did remove were baby-fine peach fuzz , not the dark ones I intended . My underarm still hurts and is still just as hairy.The wax is : Too stretchy . It does n't rip cleanly away , it stretches , defeating the purpose of waxing completely.Too cold . The built in warmer sat for nearly an hour , twice as long as it suggests , and it still barely rolled on.Too thin . The roller rolls such a thin layer ( and the instructions tell you DO NOT ROLL BACK OVER AN AREA YOU HAVE ALREADY GONE OVER many times , so I dare n't ) .The only good thing about this package was the clean up wipes that came with it . They were very effective at getting wax off skin , what was left of it , since my attempt left the hair but tore away a good amount of my skin with the waxing sheet .	-1
The Veet Easy Wax Roll On Kit was a bit of a disappointment . It does n't work as well as other wax kits . The wax itself is hard to apply . There are n't enough papers that come with the kit , and the `` wax removal oil papers '' burn my skin . Not at all happy with this product . Both my daughter and I used it and neither of us were pleased with the way the product worked .	-1
I will leave waxing to the professionals ... I followed the instructions to the letter , and , not only did the wax remove hair , but also a layer of skin . Luckily , it was just a test patch in an area that will heal easily enough .	-1
I 've used various waxes in the past . Some work better than others but most depend on how experienced you are . Too much or too little can vary results . So the idea of a roll on that would put the perfect amount on for you , create less mess & make the process easier sounded great.Unfortunately , I was wrong . There are a lot of instructions but they leave out some rather important pieces . Inserting the cartridge & warming the wax was easy enough . Just make sure you have a free evening to wait around . Once heated , it rolled on with great ease . I was optimistic at this point . I used one of the strips but nothing . The skin was clean and the hair length was what they specified . I tried different areas just in case but it was just frustrating . I 've used other brands that cost far less & worked much better than this did.They give you individual packets of wipes to remove wax from the skin . They really should just sell those separately . I may look to see if they do . They were great ! Removed leftover wax with incredible ease & left my skin extremely soft ! Unfortunately , this was a waste of time & left me disappointed .	-1
I bought this Healthmate Forever through Amazon -- it 's not a knockoff . When I received it I charged it for 2 hours , which should have rendered it fully charged . I briefly experimented with the modes , then I used it on acupuncture mode on one arm for 20 minutes . It was great ! My biceps pain was relieved for several hours after the treatment . I used it twice more for 30 minutes a session . The next time I turned it on , I had a lot of trouble getting the screen to appear long enough to select a mode , and after I finally did the power was erratic , varying from very weak to unpleasant jolts . I turned off the unit and charged it for 3 hours . I used it for three more 30-minute sessions . When I began a fourth session the unit was back to flickering on and off . And yes , I am making sure everything is properly plugged in every time . I will charge the unit again but basically , this very expensive TENS unit is defective and I expect it to die entirely soon .	-1
This thing worked amazing for the first three days that I had it ! Great for back pain relief and such . The problem is that after a few days of use it started to have connection issues where the cables plugged into the unit . I was very careful with the thing from day one as $ 100 isn & # 8217 ; t just change to throw around . The cables started having to be in just the right placement for it to work and if they swiveled at all- boy that unit would sent a painful shot to only one or two of the contact pads ... most of the time they hurt like it was turned up way past % 100 ! Also it doesn & # 8217 ; t help that the on/off button is right on the bottom in between the cables-so it was not easy for me to just turn it off when getting painfully zapped.To fix this simple problem , I thought I would just zip tie the cables to the unit to keep them in one position but it never really helped-any movement on my part just ended up in pain . All in all , when it worked it was 5* all the way ... though it was for so short of a time I have to give it only 2* . I read the reviews and thought since it was rated so high it would be ok to spend the money , but I see that the connection issue could probably happen with any of these personal units . If I had it to do over I would just save my money and buy something in the $ 30- $ 40 range as the benefits of this one didn & # 8217 ; t seem to equal the difference in the price.As a side note , I know people will say why don & # 8217 ; t you just return it ? Well the last time It shocked me really good my flight or fight kicked in and I & # 34 ; freaked out & # 34 ; ... In the rush to get it off of me asap the screen ended up broken from me clenching it so hard trying to rip it off-which the overreaction , while comical , was totally my fault .	-1
this is cheaply made so I guess that is why it is $ 10 . Not really worth that . It is thin and flimsy . The velcro that keeps it on is uncomfortable . The gel pack is very hard to get into the mask and only stays cool for a few minutes . The lavender scent packs that came with for sinus relief are so strong scented I had the pack on my night stand in my bedroom and it was completely closed yet the entire room smelled strongly of the scent . It did not help my sinus and I have a migraine today and the gel pack did not help at all . Do n't waste your money on this item . It is also poorly sized as far as the shape of the mask . It 's not even good enough for just a plain sleep mask .	-1
I noticed after taking several pills that some ( perhaps 6 in the bottle ) had a characteristic pink color . Most of the pills were a grayish-tan color . This tells me there is an inconsistency in the product which I find troubling . I can not recommend the product .	-1
I really wish I had not ordered this product , because I do not like writing negative reviews . And to tell the truth , I hate to have to do so much work to try and find anything substantial or trustworthy about a $ 20 product ! That said , I 'm careful about supplements I take , and I think you should be as well . My initial contact with this product made my alarm bells go off . So I started to investigate the lab that makes it , and suddenly , all my alarm bells were ringing . I may be wrong , and I truly am open to being corrected . However , as I dug into this one , a lot of things began to scream `` snake oil . '' I hope it 's not so , since this product is being sold by Amazon , a company I respect enormously . But I believe it 's my responsibility to tell you the truth as I see it.Let me say up front , this may be a perfectly good product . BUT , if so , the company has done nothing to provide any verifiable evidence about the pills , or itself . Its website and product info tell us next to nothing about the material we 're meant to ingest . Therefore , I give the product , and the company , Eden Ponds LLC , a one star . ( The Better Business Bureau has no rating for Eden Pond LLC , by the way ) .The owner of the Eden Pond LLC is one Samuel Keeler , according to the public records of the Secretary of State for Washington . He has been the owner/agent of a number of other `` labs '' in the last couple of years , all in the Seattle/Spokane area - which is suspicious . If a person is in the process of building a reputable supplement manufacturing business , why so many fronts ? After a short period of time ( a year or so ) , many of these `` labs '' are listed as `` inactive '' - and some of their products , formerly available on Amazon and elsewhere , are no longer supplied . It looks like consumers complain , the `` lab '' disappears - and a new one springs up . ( You can check out another Amazon Vine review for a different product of Mr. Keeler 's here : http : //www.amazon.com/review/R33KHDNW0E3B9J/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm ? ie=UTF8 & ASIN ; =B007JA647W ) . As well , Samuel Keeler and his companies are accused of promising potential reviewers free samples - if they will only write positive reviews before they get their product . That is unethical and irresponsible , in anyone 's book.I spent a career in the media , and I often do online searches on the companies from which I buy products . A quick search for Mr. Keeler produced a legal document that goes like this : `` Samuel D. Keeler and including Eden Pond LLC , Pure Source Labs LLC , and Purecap Labs LLC '' . ( There are a number of other `` labs '' in his name , including Alameda and BF ) .A search for the Eden Pond LLC address ( BBB ) provides the following address:3270 39th Ave SW , Seattle , WA 98116-3414Now , this is a private home - not where you 'd expect a reputable , sterile lab to be located.And then , another address showed up on the BBB site:5098 Halmalka Ct , Manson , WA 98831A Google Earth search displays another private home , not far from the first - but this house is in a golf course , on the ocean . Maybe business has been good to Mr. Keeler ! I 'm just not convinced yet that it is good for Amazon consumers.Let me tell you why I ordered this product . My wife is a fan of astaxanthin as a supplement derived from ocean algae . Astaxanthin is said to provide powerful `` antioxidants to fight free radicals and promote cell function '' ( according to the bottle sitting on my desk ) . She said the price was good , and since I 'm Vine reviewer and could get a free sample , why not try it ? Now I 'm sorry I did , because the investigation has created a lot of work I 'd rather not have felt obligated to undertake . I just hope my investigation is of use to you.We got the bottle , my wife inspected the product , and said right away , `` something is wrong . Either this is a chemical replica , or it is a fake . '' She has ordered astaxanthin in the past , from a number of reputable suppliers , and it comes as a liquid in a gel cap . The Eden Pond offering is a grayish/white powder in a capsule . That rang the first alarm bell.You see , astaxanthin ( and I quote Wikipedia ) `` is a keto-carotenoid ... a colorful , lipid-soluble pigment ... . Astaxanthin is found in microalgae , yeast , salmon , trout , krill , shrimp , crayfish , crustaceans , and the feathers of some birds . It provides the red color of salmon meat and the red color of cooked shellfish . `` I do n't want to get carried away with the technical , but the key word is `` carotenoid '' - as in `` carrot '' and we know what color that is . Most astaxanthin supplements do contain the color - so why is Eden Ponds ' version a bland gray-white powder ? Even when you add water , and I did , it has no carotenoid color.I was looking for answers and I phoned the company several times . ( The toll free number is on the label - 888 623-2496 ) . No matter when I call , I never get anything but the same recording . It says that `` all other agents are busy '' - but in fact , there never are other agents , and it seems suspiciously like a simple phone-company auto answering message . Try it for yourself.The recording does steer a person to the Eden Pond website : www.edenpond.com . I went there , and became more upset . I felt insulted by the airy claims , but lack of any evidence . This is not what we , as consumers , should expect about the health-enhancers we put in our bodies and feed to our families . For example , the `` About Us '' section says , `` We create our products with a think tank of brilliant minds . Naturopathic doctors , biochemists , and health gurus help us to produce the best and brightest supplements on the market ... . '' So come on Mr. Keeler - name one of these experts ! Why do you not list the credentials of a single person , beginning with yourself ? There 's another section entitled `` Recent News '' - not one entry . It seems like a cookie-cutter , unfinished website , created by a copy writer.Health conscious consumers in 2014 are both too smart , and too jaded by the con artists , to be taken in by smarmy statements , without any reputation or facts to back them up.Let 's get to specifics : the Eden Pond pill bottle says each capsule contains only astaxanthin - 4 mg per cap . Other ingredients : vegetable capsule . But the pill clearly contains much more of some material than a tiny 4 milligrams - so what is that white powder ? Let me compare it to a reputable vitamin and supplement supplier ( one in which I have no ownership or vested interest ) - Swanson 's Vitamins . Here 's the `` apples to apples '' comparison : Swanson 's description of its 4 mg capsule : `` Astaxanthin [ from natural astaxanthin complex ( Supercritical CO2 extract of H. pluvialis algae ) ] ... Other ingredients : Safflower oil , gelatin , glycerin , deionized water , carob . `` Now , that is good information . Reading that , I feel a lot less like I 've had smoke blown up my hind end . Are you listening , Mr. Keeler ? Your products may be fine - I am open to being convinced . But please , tell your customers what your product contains , what it is derived from - and on your website , please provide your own credentials , and those of your advisory board and chief employees . Is that too much to ask ? In fact , I think we should expect that , at the very least.Unfortunately , based on what I 've been able to turn up on Mr. Keeler and his labs , I can not recommend this , or any other of his products , to you .	-1
This product is a small liquid-gel filled capsule . It 's easy to swallow and leaves no aftertaste . I just wished it worked.I eat many foods that contain beans . Bean soups and chilli are my favorite . I have suffered with gas all my life and occasionally used gas medicine . I have tried this gas relief medicine three times now and it has caused more discomfort than it has relieved.The first time I tried Phazyme I developed cramping in my lower abdomen like you have with diarrhea . At first I thought maybe I just had a touch of a stomach bug and would give it another try later . I have since tried it two more times and developed the same type of cramping after each use and I still have the gas along with a lot of burping.Decided to try it one more time . For lunch today I had a bowl of chilli . I again took this medicine at around 1:30 . It is now two hours later and I am still burping , cramping and passing gas . This medicine does nothing for me .	-1
I 'm a guy . My lower digestive tract gets gassy and painful . What can I say ? I thought this stuff would help ease the bloating and pain , but it does nothing . I do n't understand this product : it 's just simethicone . It does n't remove gas from your system . That 's impossible . What 's more , if you have gas wayyyy down in your lower digestive area , this stuff ai n't gon na help . It 'll be gone by the time it gets there ! It 's an anti-foaming agent - that 's all . You 'll still have gas in your system . It does n't magically disappear . I do n't have gas in my stomach - this stuff seems to think that 's where it 's needed or that 's the area it can work . This stuff does n't do anything for me and I 'm shocked people actually take it .	-1
I found these to not work nearly as well as every other brand I 've tried . Gas-ex is definitely better , as are the Target and Walmart store brands of the same thing . It definitely did n't `` go to work in minutes '' and it did n't last as long as I would expect it to . I will definitely be sticking with other brands .	-1
I usually wear medium size , but some reviews mentioned these were a little tight . I ordered the large size to make sure they would fit . According to the size chart printed on the box , the medium size should fit my hands , but even the large size is too small for my hands . I tried to exchange them with x-large or xx-large , but my return windows has expired and now I have a full box that I can not use .	-1
As others have said this is a great deodorant to help you with odor , however it does n't have antiperspirant so it does n't do anything for the wetness . For me I need both , deodorant and antiperspirant so I have to say this is a pass for me .	-1
It was great at the beginning , but like others that have reviewed the product , it too caused some irritation by the end of the first week . Seems my skin got used to it but sometimes I still feel the irritation . This is NOT to be used if you are wearing a sleeveless shirt , it makes a horrible white foamy residue under your arms . Looks ugly . I always use Dove products and this one is on the lower end of the quality spectrum .	-1
This is an awful deodorant . Not only it does not do what it is supposed to do , it irritates the skin and stings a lot . Only reason why it is not 1-star is because it actually smells pretty nice . That said , the cons override the pros all day .	-1
If you have sensitive skin Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant will eventually make you break out in rash regardless of the `` non-irritating '' claim . Dove took about three weeks before the rash came on . Until that point I liked it but the burning rash is a deal killer . The last few years the only deodorant I have been able to use with out irritation is Adidas . It can be hard to find but they have really good scents and no burning pits .	-1
I am accustomed to an alcohol-based aftershave , one that does not contain moisturizer but just conditions the skins and feels refreshing . I have tried post-shave lotions before , but always found them too greasy . This Axe post-shave lotion is different . It pumps out of the container as a medium-thickness white lotion that rubs in easily and does not streak . It was certainly not greasy , but as soon as I had it on my face , I wondered if I had put on suntan lotion instead . It smells just like that fake coconut smell which brings back memories of summer days at the beach . Pleasant for a few minutes , yes , but all day ? Certainly , the smell lingered . I went on a long hike , and by the time the odor had mixed with , well , my odor , it just smelled awful and I could n't wait to get away from myself ( in other words , take a shower and scrub well ) .I much preferred the other Axe post-shave product , theAxe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel , Chilled , Cooling , 3.3 Ounce . I would recommend that over this one unless you really love the odor . Your best bet might be to try it in a drugstore first before you order it online .	-1
Yesterday , I told you about my experience with AXE 's Chilled formula aftershave . I had higher hopes for the `` Shield '' formula as it is for sensitive skin and more closely matches my current aftershave from Gillette . While this formula did not turn my skin red or leave bumps , it still did n't do the job . My skin was not visibly irritated , but I was left with a scratchy burning sensation as it started to dry . It looks like I 'm 0-2 using AXE 's aftershave products . Back to Gillette I go ...	-1
AXE Face Hydrator and Post Shave Lotion smells like you have Pina Colada Slurpee on your face , which is ok if you 're into that . The product itself seemed to make my face greasy for several hours even though Axe claim it wo n't . It did do a good job of relieving any skim irritation after shaving . I am sticking with Neutrogena Men Razor Defense Post Shave Lotion which has a lighter scent and does not have that greasy feel .	-1
When we first bought this , it said my wife was at `` peak '' fertility the day after a `` zero '' rating , then a little book symbol showed up on the screen which showed that it was broken . Also , when it shows `` peak fertility '' , the smiley face stays on the screen for TWO days and you can not take another test . When we bought another test through another company it confirmed that the ClearBlue was incorrect , be careful with this thing .	-1
I do not recommend this item AT ALL ! ! ! The concept behind it is that it will let you know a couple of days earlier than other , similar devices when ovulation begins . That would be a great thing , except this device was completely wrong . A couple of days before we thought ovulation would begin , my wife used this and it indicated that ovulation would not be in the next few days . She was a little bit surprised , but it 's not so odd that there would be a little variation in when ovulation occurs , so we did n't think much of it . The next day , again , it indicated that ovulation would not begin in the next several days . And the next day , too . Finally , she used one of the deviced we 'd gotten earlier and it showed that she was , in fact , already ovulating . As it turns out , that was the last day of ovulation and we nearly missed the entire window-of-opportunity because of this thing.The month before , when she used it , it worked well . But that means it worked 50 % of the time , which is not at all acceptable.I would never use this again ( well , my wife would never use it again , but you get what I mean ... ) and I would not recommend it under any circumstances . Maybe this was a one-in-a-million fluke , but that 's not a chance we 're willing to take.Note : I just checked the other reviews to see if other people have had similar experiences . It looks like it 's worked for a little over 70 % of the people . To my mind , that 's not nearly consistent enough .	-1
I have been tracking my ovulation for about 6 months now , and if you have too , you know how expensive these things are . I have been using simple strips I got on Amazon for about $ 7/50 . I used these simultaneously with the ClearBlue in order to compare.For the first two days , both clearly indicated I was n't ovulating . Then the simple strips began to show `` high fertility '' ( the time right before you ovulate- you can tell because one line is red and one is pink- when you ovulate both are red ) . The ClearBlue never indicated high fertility . On the fifth day , both indicated Peak Fertility . On the sixth day , I went to check using both again and the ClearBlue was now broken . It was stuck on the Fertility symbol ( smiley face ) and would n't reset . Since there is no reset button to clear the digital reading , I am now stuck with a wand that is useless and many sticks that ca n't be used . That would be pretty annoying if I had spent almost $ 40 on this package of sticks . This made the thing pretty useless for me ( especially when it did n't indicate High Fertility as it advertised ) .The wand itself is fairly simple to understand . It comes separate from the sticks you pee on ( or dip in a container of pee if you prefer ) , but be aware the instructions say you must use your first urination after you wake up in the morning to test , and the time for soaking is different if you insert the stick into a stream or just dip ( 3 seconds vs. 15 seconds ) . You start by clipping the strip/stick into the wand and then soak it for the allotted time ( make sure the purple arrows line up ) . Then you will see a `` thinking '' icon on the wand . It takes about 5 minutes for the reading to appear . I panicked when I went to walk the dogs and came back to find the reading was blank , but in the instructions it explains the reading only stays for 2 min . then you can get it back by ejecting and reinserting the test stick . I did this and got a reading.I was pleased this worked at first , but I have to say that both the lack of High Fertility reading and the fact that the wand broke after 5 uses ( leaving me with 3/4 unused and useless test sticks ) was pretty frustrating . And again , if you are seeking these out , chances are you have been trying to get pregnant for a while and are becoming stressed and frustrated because it is n't happening ( welcome to my world ) . Therefore , blowing a lot of money on these sticks to have them fail would be more stress than you need right now . I would n't ever purchase these , and I wo n't be recommending them.One side note , in the instructions where it explains the different symbols and their meanings , the `` Low Fertility '' symbol has an explanation under it that explains fertility is low and `` intercourse on this day would only be for fun ! '' If you have been dealing with this struggle for a while , the levity is much appreciated , especially when you find yourself collecting your own urine every morning as a ritual you never imagined would be part of your life when you were younger ! So , good luck everyone out there . I hope you have a happy outcome !	-1
I was really looking forward to trying this product . For all those who are TTC , this business can get pretty expensive and a rollercoaster of emotions does n't help the journey . I have been checking my ovulation with different methods including Billings - found out I ovulate way too early and hardly catch the `` right day '' .This kit looks really promising and in fact , I was about to buy it . My very good friend had great results she began using Clear Blue 5 years ago when she got pregnant with her first child . It only took her 1 month to find out she had a late ovulation and another month to help move the time a little bit ( she was lacking some vitamins ) but anyways , it really worked for her so I think this product has potential.As for me , in the other hand , this product was not as reliable as I had hoped . To give a detailed review of the product , I will have to give maybe TMI so feel free to skip ahead or keep reading.My cycle is only 25 days . My period is 6 full days plus 2 days of spotting . My ovulation cycle starts on day 8 or 9 . My normal peak is on day 10 or 11 . This patter is very constant month by month so we ( DH and I ) think that there are other factors involved in our inability to conceive.Now the product . Since I begin ovulating right away , I decided to start testing on day 7 of my cycle . The CB wand showed a simple circle which means low fertility . I then tested on day 8 of my cycle and had my first `` happy face blinking '' which means high fertility ( I was still spotting that day ) . I tested again day 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , all showing high fertility but no peak . I knew that my peak had already past and maybe I was even done ovulating so I tested again day 16 of my cycle and had my first peak . The happy face displayed with no blinking . But then the display froze . So was that another blinking face that froze or was it really a peak ? I could n't use the wand after this . The frozen face stood on the display for 3 days with no avail . I removed the batteries ( in order to sort of reset the display ) but something is wrong with it because the display shows a mark , like a spot on the left that 's frozen . So I have almost 15 sticks that I ca n't use now . That was disappointing : ( As a side note , I only use one of the two methods for testing . I exactly counted 3 seconds with direct flow on the stick . I did n't test the immersion in the cup method.I do n't know if this option is a bit too sensitive or if it is unreliable . I have seen so many different opinions and results . These are mine . Maybe my Estrogen and LH hormone skyrocketed so high that exploded inside this wand , ruining the display forever ! : P	-1
I have used the Clearblue Digital Ovulation kit for many months without a single issue . When the opportunity to try the Advanced kit arose I figured I would try it out , despite the bad things I had read on other sites . Boy do I regret it ! I have now wasted 2 months trying to conceive thanks to this piece of trash ! In August I got 3 days of `` low fertility '' circle followed by 5 days of the blinking `` high fertility '' face and never got the steady `` peak fertility '' face . I then menstruated normally , much to my surprise since I thought I had n't yet ovulated . Now in September I have gotten the blank circle from cycle day 11-16 . I saw a fertility doctor who gave me an ultrasound that proves I in fact ovulated again ! I followed the instructions to the letter . I used the first mornings urine as they instruct , then I also tried later in the afternoon on a 4 hour urine hold . It is horrible that a product that women are supposed to use when trying to get pregnant is so unreliable . I would never waste my time and money on this product nor would I recommend it to anyone .	-1
I 've had problems lately with skin irritations . I thought this product would help a lot , but I was disappointed . It did n't work any better for me than Anbesol , which I can get anywhere .	-1
Bought based on reviews & was extremely disappointed . Did n't provide any pain relief or alleviation . Followed directions & did n't numb skin at all !	-1
yes it says `` 4 % '' but I 've let this s*** sit in globs and barely works . I have to had blood drawn often . Does n't work if it dries out so do n't rub it in . Buy a better brand .	-1
I bought this for my face , when I used the Dermaroller . Did not numb me at all ... very disappointed . I wouldnt purchase this again .	-1
It did not work for me unfortunately . I am not sure if the product was old or what but I tried it on several spots of my body with different amount and timing before I gave my review on it and yet I was sad to discover it did not work for me . Hope others had a better experience	-1
WORTHLESS . Totally worthless . I 've used many types of numbing products ( even EMLA which has been the best for me but pricey ) . This was like rubbing on baby lotion.I let it sit.I covered it.NOTHING . FREAKING NOTHING . When it came time for the reason I needed this stuff , I was unable to continue because it hurt so much . I 've never been so disappointed in a numbing product in my life , even the ones I thought were bad at least gave me a little numbness .	-1
I reviewed this product already , but Amazon keeps wanting me to rate it again . Here I go again ! Had to return it . Ordered two bottles and I paid for the return shipping cost . The oil may be terrific but it 's carrier oil is soybean oil . Since almost all soybean oil is genetically modified , I immediately returned this product . I emailed the company about the soybean oil . They called me back . They indicated they were changing the soybean oil to extra virgin olive oil . I do not recommend this product . If they change the carrier oil to extra virgin olive oil , I may reconsider purchasing this product . As of a couple weeks ago they have n't made the change .	-1
I purchased mine at a much lower price from Costco yesterday ( in addition to $ 4 off special ) but will throw them out today . I was using Jarrow formula which is vegan , but saw these as a better deal . Way too sweet with artificial sweetener mannitol and plenty other toxic substances . Wish I had seen this comparison of formulas before I purchased . http : //www.toxinless.com/vitamin-b12 .	-1
Was going to buy this for a child with ADHD since you get 5 times more than the Jarrow version for the same price . Seemed all natural too , they even used natural cherry and red beetroot . I read some more then I saw sucralose . Sucralose is one of the incredients that contributes to ADHD and other brain disorders and is banned from his diet by the nutritionist . I would rather pay the higher price and have it all natural .	-1
I 've never tried this item and while it sounds very good , I just want to say that the majority of the reviews here , ( besides mine ) are fake . Actually , I believe ALL 5 of the other reviews are fake , because they have all reviewed the same products and then throw in some random stuff to LOOK like actual people . They are n't . If you look at their reviewing trends you 'll see a slew of supplements and then some jeans or t-shirts . Also , none of these people have places listed on their accounts .	-1
you can not find this size box ( quantity & gallon size ) in any retailers , maybe sams or here worth it to cheaper in bulk	-1
I just got around to using this box of liners . Tried to put bag into my trash barrel it is long enough but the end with the draw string will not go around the top of the barrel . The draw string has zero stretch .	-1
I apologize that I do n't have a long , comprehensive review of this product , but I was unwilling to use it for very long , and that is relevant to why the review is short and only covers one element of the possible experience with this product.Using this left my face raw , and did not even provide a close shave as a mitigating part of that experience ( and I tried ) . The instructions included advise to give it `` three weeks '' to let your face and beard acclimate to it . From previous experience with electric razors , I think that is just BS . I 've used electric razors before that gave me a closer shave , and with no irritation , on the very first use .	-1
I have not used an electric shaver in years . Norelco and the other brands always say `` give it 2 weeks so your face can adjust '' . I always figured they meant it would take 2 weeks to forget what a good shave from a blade felt like . But they claim it is because you are scraping away the top layer of skin when you shave ( flaying yourself , essentially ) and it takes the 2 weeks to restore itself . I dunno . Sounds like baloney to me . I will update in one month to see if I buy their rationale.OK , Update about 3 weeks later : No , in my unscientific survey on one , my face did not adapt to an electric shaver . Nothing is as close as a blade . The virtue of the electric shaver remains convenience.For now , I have to say if I use it twice a day , I get a pretty close shave , but it takes about 3 minutes , which saves me 1 minute over a blade but also does n't involve a lot of water and soap . It cleans easily : pop of the blade housing and blow out the whiskers , and then run it under running water for a few seconds . The motor is powered by induction like an electric toothbrush so it is waterproof ... handy.I am less sure about the beard grooming attachments . They fill up with hair quickly and have to be cleared , although that only takes a moment . They also seem less than precise.As for the body hair attachment ... well , that is staying in its little cardboard recess , until that time comes that I want to shave some football team name on my belly , paint myself red , and show up at a stadium in hopes of proving I 'm an idiot on TV . So , no opinion there.All in all , a weak little shaver that does the job if you give it time .	-1
One of the heads did a nice job but cutting my facial down to that coveted 5 o'clock Shawdow . AMA was very nice sending stuff back thanks	-1
My husband was n't happy with this kit . He did get a pretty smooth shave over his cheeks and chin without using shaving cream , but in the mustache area and around his mouth there was stubble left . He tried to fix that by wet shaving with shaving cream , but it did not do any better . Although the heads are easy to change , cleaning them takes time and effort that other shavers do n't require.Another problem is with the body groomer . As far as I know , most men 's body hair is more than 1/8 '' long . If yours is n't , you have to cut it to that length with the comb before you can use the groomer to shave it . Any hair that is n't that short will catch in the razor head where it is then almost impossible to remove . This means that there are two steps to the body grooming . I ca n't imagine why anyone would want to go through this double effort . My husband has a small cordless electric groomer that does a great job , and he does n't have to cut the hair twice no matter how long it is.I suspect that a man would have to be really motivated to wait three weeks to get a razor to give him a really smooth shave . And you ca n't help things along by supplementing the shave with another kind of razor while you are waiting because `` it may make it more difficult to adapt . '' That means you have to go around not looking your best for 3 weeks while you wait for the hoped for adaptation to take place . My husband was n't about to do that . He said , `` Forget it , '' and went back to using his 5-blade wet razor , and the cordless electric groomer for body grooming that I mentioned above.This is a very nice looking device , but I was surprised to see that there is no stand , case or holder for it of any type nor any kind of holder for the parts . For $ 69.95 I would expect to see at least a pouch.This kit might appeal to a young guy who is just starting to shave and does n't know there are bettet faster ways , but I do n't believe an adult who has had experience with many different types of shavers and groomers would be willing to use a kit that he has to make so much effort to adapt to instead of it adapting to him .	-1
I got this because I like the stubble look and I was tired of using multiple trimmers to maintain it ( one to even out length , one to edge , one for a smooth close shave , nose hair trimmer , etc . ) .This does EVERYTHING . The only problem is , it does n't do any of it particularly well.It takes multiple passes with the guard to get the length even , the edger/mini foil do not shave close at all and still leave a very visible stubble . I ended up having to go back to my old tools to correct the mistakes of this thing.AND on top of all that , it irritated my skin.If I had it to do over , I would definitely NOT buy this product again .	-1
i had to send this unit back , i tried it for about a month , gave myself a haircut about every week just to be sure i wasnt using it wrong . it was very under poweredto me , for haircuts anyway , i just couldnt get it to cut my hair evenly and my hair ultimately just kept coming up uneven . i bought it to go wireless , i currently use a wired one and i hate wires , im sure there is a good one out there , but this was not for me.on the plus side though , the attachments seem good , and is a versatile product . battery life seems ok but not great .	-1
I 've had a number of trimmers over the years & I 'd say this one is below average . It 's also the most EXPENSIVE one of the bunch . They went cheap & do n't supply a head guard or a hard plastic stand ; I 've gotten either or both with trimmers costing half as much ( including Norelco ) . You 're just supposed to store everything in a travel pouch which increases the risk of damage . The turbo option is more of a gimmick than anything else . Why not just have one sufficient setting with enough power ? Also , it 's not nearly as powerful as the Wahl 's I 've owned . And it 's an inconsistent setting since sometimes when it 's turned on it starts in low & sometimes in turbo mode.6-05-14 UPDATE : The unit is inconsistent in it 's power output . At times it will go at full speed , other times slow & sometimes it will die completely . It constantly will go back & forth . This happens even if fully charged & /or plugged in ! ! !	-1
I 've used a similar WAHL trimmer for probably 5 years ... and have replaced it 3 times due to the internal battery crapping out . But each time I go back to the WAHL because aside from the battery , I love it.When given the chance to review this one , I thought this might be as good as the WAHL but without battery issues two years from now . I was wrong . This Norelco has a goofy head that trims less area and does a worse job . The blade speed is MUCH slower than the WAHL and it took me longer to trim . Half way thru my second use of this , I disgustingly threw it in the drawer and went back to my WAHL and I have n't touched it since.If you 're looking for a good multifunction trimmer with Lithium Ion battery , stick with this WAHL http : //www.amazon.com/Wahl-Lithium-Ion-All-Trimmer/dp/B001GQ3GEY	-1
I purchased this multi-groomer on sale for a very good price to replace the Norelco Vacuum trimmer . Although it initially cut through my rather short beard very well , it seems to be dying after only three short months of use . I 'm not sure if the issue is the battery or the mechanics of the trimmer , but this morning it would barely cut for a minute before dying after being on the charger overnight . Given the lack of vacuum and longevity , I would probably pass on this trimmer and go for the vacuum model . Your beard and your wife will thank you !	-1
This trimmer is just mediocre.1 . It comes with a bunch of attachments that are n't intuitive at all . You have to try to read the microscopic print on users ' manual which is actually a sheet of paper folded up a million ways like some kind of origami experiment . Said attachments are flimsy and feel crappy and undoubtedly will break quickly . Since I ca n't figure out how to use most of them , they are just sitting in the nice little chintzy zippered bag included in the box.2 . The charger is not an induction charger like most good trimmers have . Instead , it 's a weird little plug-in thing which is very hard to tell which way it plugs in . Furthermore , there is no stand , so the whole trimmer just lays on it 's side wherever you decide to plug it in.3 . It trims well enough , but overall build quality feels third-rate to me . Basically feels like some cheapo made in China but with the Norelco name slapped on it.There are much better trimmers out there at similar price points .	-1
I used another Philips for two years and was happy and just decided to & # 34 ; upgrade & # 34 ; to this one . Used it for 2 weeks and sent it back . It feels cheap , it 's not flexible and is hard on your skin . It 's alright , but I did n't keep it .	-1
I have the shaver set at the closest setting and it just is tough to get the job done properly . The results are quite uneven . My previous beard trimmer was a Wahl which I gave 5 stars but it gave up the ghost . I will not buy this brand again .	-1
a Wahl at Walmart is 24.99 less than this shaver and cuts hair just as close for less . Get it instead .	-1
Only 6 months ago this was selling for $ 17.99 and now the price is jumping around all over the place , sometimes doubling or even tripling . Come on Philips , stop with the ridiculous price .	-1
It advertise it as a `` beard trimmer '' which is specifically designed for your facial hair , but it is not true.I have a Philips QC5530 hair clipper , and I also have a Philips CC5060 baby hair clipper for my son . Put them together , except some difference on the shape , blade size , and the height-setting system , there is nothing different . It is extremely similar to the baby clipper just different color and again the height-setting system : the baby clipper is a comb which you adjust the height vertically , the QT4000 is that you rotate the circle . The blade is exactly the same.I bought this expecting it act like a shaver which could hold the beard so that I do not need to clean the countertop and sink every time I use it , but I am wrong . It spread the beard everywhere and I need to clean the aftermath for 5+ minutes.While compare with QC5530 hair clipper , this QT4000 is not good in that it is NOT WHOLE BODY WASHABLE ! So it is not safe to use it in shower room . For QC5530 although it also spread all the beard , I could use it in shower room when I take shower and just flush the hair away , with this , I have to use it in front of the countertop and clean the sink with paper towel.The only thing good is it is small and light weight , you may consider it if you travel a lot . Otherwise , for those who want to buy this , I recommend you consider QC5530 . ( it is wired as I check on Amazon now QC5530 is sold for $ 100+..I bought it for $ 25 and I think it just worth this money . Anyway , any one in QC55x0 series is a good way to go ) .	-1
